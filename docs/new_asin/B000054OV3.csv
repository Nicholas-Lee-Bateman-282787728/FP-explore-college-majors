1393724,4,B000054OV3,"a very strange and funny little film from Roger Cormans  no[not low] budget days. Set in Cuba during Castros takeover.it has crime,murder, spys and a monster you won't believe.a low cost dvd to add to your horrible horror collection.",1080518400,,233,4.9743589743589745
1393725,3,B000054OV3,"This zany little Roger Corman quickie turned up frequently on a local TV station's late, late, late show many years ago. Thinking ""Creature from the Haunted Sea"" was just another lousy  low grade horror flick, I barely noticed it even as it flickered on the TV screen that I used, more often than not, as a night light.
But I did catch a scene in which a couple of skin-divers descended into the sea, and when I saw that one of them carried a toilet plunger, I silently mused a thoughtful ""Hmm,"" and made a mental note to pay attention the next time it aired.
""Creature from the Haunted Sea"" is a satire of adventure films as delightfully daffy as Corman's ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" but with a more subtle approach. It's not a knee-slapper, but it is amusing, and well cast. There's Anthony Carbone doing a fiendishly silly homage to Humphrey Bogart, and future screenwriter Robert Towne as the earnest young hero. You even get a title song, a love theme containing the complete title, sung by the leading lady, Betsy Jones Moreland.
This is a movie that is probably best seen unexpectedly in the wee hours of an uneventful night. By morning, you may think it was just a silly dream.",1076716800,6,1183,4.553990610328638
1393726,2,B000054OV3,"Only one man could produce and direct a movie as outrageously stupid as The Creature From the Haunted Sea: Roger Corman.  I might as well start with the monster.  If you thought low-budget Japanese monster movies featured the most patently fake monsters in the cinematic universe, you haven't seen Corman's creature from the haunted sea.  A kindergarten class could make a better monster out of shoelaces and a couple of buttons.  You have to see it; I can't even begin to explain how ludicrous this monster is.
The story is also laughable.  After Castro's revolution, counter-revolutionary forces have stolen the treasury of Cuba, and their plan is to sneak the gold off the island in an American boat.  They choose Lorenzo because, according to their reasoning, the fact that he is an American gambler makes him beyond reproach.  Lorenzo's crew is, in a word, unreal.  First, there is his best girl Marybelle and her brother Happy Jack, who got his name from the twitch he developed from watching too many Humphrey Bogart movies.  Next up is Pete Peterson, Jr., whom, as the narrator actually explains to us, is the son of Pete Peterson, Sr.  Pete's only talent is his ability to mimic any and all kinds of animals, but he's never been the same since blowing his brain out of whack imitating a whooping crane years earlier.  Then there is the ""hero"" of our story, an American spy who makes Maxwell Smart look like Albert Einstein.  He never really understands what is going on, but he diligently reports his non-findings to headquarters using his home-made, undetectable radio set constructed using simulated hot dogs for knobs and tubes inside of dill pickles.  His narration of the story is filled with incredibly philosophical statements such as ""It was coming on dusk. I knew because the sun was going down.""  Getting back to the plot, the crooked Americans want the gold for themselves, so they hatch an elaborate plot to kill the Cuban soldiers on board one by one and make each death appear to be the work of a mythical sea creature.  What they don't know is that the creature, as ridiculous as he is, actually does exist.
Featuring such unexplained oddities as a pay phone (with a steady stream of users) existing on a deserted island, this movie goes out of its way to insult the intelligence of every creature who ever harbored a conscious thought.  As a result, the film is pretty darn funny at times, although one is hard pressed to see whether or not Corman intended this to be a comedy or a serious monster movie.  I for one never know what Roger Corman could possible have been thinking.",1045353600,5,2604,4.738359201773836
1393727,2,B000054OV3,"Made as an afterthought on the trip back from some other shoot (a fairly typical Corman occurrence), CFHS is probably much too weird even for most fringe types who like Corman's other stuff to accept.
The setting is the Cuban Revolution, and Corman educates viewers on the conflict not with stock footage of some other war as Ed Wood might have done, but with Addams-style cartoons. The film's opening scenes are sharp- if easy- satire, relating a chase and the introductory meeting between the movie's nominal hero Sparks Moran and a female co-spy. Sparks is played by future Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne, who brings to mind Nicolas Cage's head on Alan Alda's body, and underplays his idiotic secret agent admirably. We learn that a chest of gold has been stolen from Cuba's treasury, and Moran is infiltrating the group of militants and mobsters who are trying to sail away with it.
They get on a sailing boat, and the mobsters plan to kill off the Cuban army members one-by-one, using a made-up creature as their cover. But a real monster shows up, and they have to alter their plans.
Some of the best comedy is in this section, as we meet a crewman capable of making animal noises, hear more of Moran's noodlehead pontificating, and when the mobster's moll sings a number without stopping during a machine gun shootout. I'm not aware of another filmmaker besides Corman working in satire like this by 1960.
But then their ship crashes on some reefs and they seek refuge on an (almost) deserted isle. The movie slows down and gets repetitive here, and additional scenes were shot to pad out its running time for TV. These are of a comedic level with Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki or even the abysmal Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla, as two crew members meet tropical ladies they fall in love with. Whereas the earlier sections were silly but (I daresay) ahead of their time, the hijinx in this portion you've mostly seen before. By the time the monster shows up and starts killing people again, the damage is done.
A few funny deadpan wisecracks are spread throughout, of the kind that might make Clouseau seem like Einstein: ""It was coming on dusk. I knew because the sun was going down."" But the movie dies a death far worse than the monster could ever inflict in its middle portion.
One step down from Little Shop of Horrors, a step-and-a-half from Bucket of Blood, if this flick would've stayed on the boat or Cuba and avoided the reefs altogether, it might have surpassed them both.
Quality note: I took 1 star off this otherwise 3-star flick for the poor quality. This dvd skipped all over the place in Chapters 1 and 2 of 4, so you may wish to try another version. But probably none of them are going to be wonderful. Alas, it's public-domain Corman, after all. Caveat Emptor.",1023321600,7,2800,4.67004048582996

1393749,3,B000054OV3,"I streamed the Lorimar release of this movie via Amazon Prime.  Some of the scenes I had read about, including the Cuban officers saluting as their boat sinks,  were not in the movie.  I noticed that the Lorimar release is a few seconds over an hour.  Amazon offers a release by AFA Entertainment which is listed as an hour and fifteen minutes.  Wikipedia lists the movie as 75 minutes.  There are several versions available on Amazon, I recommend caution before spending money on one of them.

What there was of the movie in the Lorimar release has too much humor to be a creature feature and not enough to be a comedy.  The first 20 or 30 minutes were fairly amusing.  Corman and company use  the Cuban Revolution as a back drop for a story featuring corrupt officials, stolen government gold, American gangsters and an inept American spy.  Which reminds me to say that the viewer should be wary of the closed captioning.  According to it the spy has a fictitious background as a notorious GUN machine burglar.  The actual dialogue is quite clear - he poses as a notorious GUM machine burglar to get into the gang.  There are a lot of humorous through away lines like this throughout the movie.

Anthony Carbone is pretty good playing the soft spoken, murderous but not completely serious gang boss.  He does it with a straight face and a bit of Bogart including the cap.  Betsey Jones-Moreland is pretty good as Carbone's gun moll, playing the roll with a decent Southern accent.  It is too bad these two and their supporting cast didn't have better material with which to work.  This could have been a really funny, zany movie but it isn't.",1476403200,3,1644,4.606896551724138

The trick for Renzo and his cronies is to separate the Cubans from the gold. The plan to create an elusive sea monster that can each Cubans. However, what if there really is a sea monster that prefers Cuban? This is just one of the overlying plots that include love triangles over triangles and government spies.

CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA (1959) is a personal favorite turkey. Directed by Roger Corman, it was one of his early attempts at combining the horror and comedy genres.

Almost all of this one's ""actors"" are the rankest of amateurs. Comically inept Cuban soldiers abound, the ""script"" seems improvised (a sinking boat wasn't planned, for example) and the sea creature is a guy in a rubber suit with ping pong balls glued on for eyes!

Anthony Carbone (as Renzo Capetto) does a bad Bogie impression throughout. Co-star Robert Towne, as secret agent XK-150, provides a joke-laden voiceover. Towne later scripted such films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHINATOWN/dp/B00AEFXN9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHINATOWN</a>&nbsp;(1974) and its sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TWO-JAKES/dp/B00AEBB9N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TWO JAKES</a>&nbsp;(1990), the first two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MISSION-IMPOSSIBLE/dp/B000EGDB10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MISSION IMPOSSIBLE</a>s,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HEAVEN-CAN-WAIT/dp/B00AEFY7NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HEAVEN CAN WAIT</a>&nbsp;(1978),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FIRM/dp/B00AEFXYJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FIRM</a>&nbsp;(1993) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MISSOURI-BREAKS/dp/B00NQKW85G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MISSOURI BREAKS</a>&nbsp;(1976).

My favorite moment in ""Haunted Sea"" occurs in Spanish with subtitles. The line is: ""They look like bottom row prizes in a shooting gallery."" Watch for it.

Best of all-- in this one THE MONSTER WINS! He eats just about everybody. At the end, we see him contentedly perched on a sought after treasure chest, human skeletons scattered all around. The creature lets go with a loud belch, then we fade out.

1393861,5,B000054OV3,"For me, a movie need not have big stars, fancy special effects, showy performances, or anything else associated with a prestigious production to be worthwhile. Low-budget doesn't always equate low quality, and often times a nifty little B-movie offers an offbeat storyline and quirky performances that rival an A-production in terms of sheer entertainment value. In truth, it's the cheapies that seem to gain a cult popularity while many of the more ""respectable"" films fade from our collective memory. THE ROGER CORMAN PUERTO RICO TRILOGY from Retromedia contains three excellent examples of a film's content superceding its production cost.

In 1960, independent producer/director Roger Corman went to Puerto Rico which would allow him to make two films there on a shoe-string budget and ended up sneaking in a third. BATTLE OF BLOOD ISLAND has two WWII GI's stranded on a Pacific island trying to cope with the threatening presence of a Japanese combat patrol as well as with each other's frayed nerves. LAST WOMAN ON EARTH tells the bleak aftermath of the end of the world which leaves three survivors - two men and a woman - faced with the task of propagating the human race. CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA was really an afterthought, since Corman still had some time to spare as well as the cast and crew to squeze in another movie. This one is a tongue-in-cheek re-write of Corman's BEAST FROM THE HAUNTED CAVE (1959), sort of a TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT noir/spoof with a monster thrown in.

All three of these movies are available elsewhere on budget DVDs with lousy quality, but thanks to this re-mastered set, they can be better appreciated for their underrated merits. This is especially true with LAST WOMAN ON EARTH which, transferred from an original, 35mm widescreen color print, emerges as a profound, intimate sci-fi drama that addresses various consequences brought about by a worldwide catastrophe that don't turn up in other films with this premise. In Robert Towne's (who also starred in the film) excellent screenplay, the things we regard so highly in life - faith, money, marriage - all of a sudden are tested as to their lasting value when, it seems, nothing matters anymore. Even though hope for the continuation of our species is ultimately restored, the film ends on a decidedly downbeat note. Also worth mentioning is Ronald S. Stein's luxurious music score which adds a romantically poignant atmosphere to this minor masterpiece. The delightfully bizarre CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA is also presented in its proper 1:85:1 aspect ratio.

The special features include Roger Corman's intros to all three films, commentaries by cast members Antony Carbone and Betsy Jones-Moreland, and Retromedia's Fred Olen Ray and Steve Latshaw, original trailers for LAST WOMAN ON EARTH and CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA, and extended scenes that were added for TV.

Don't allow the fact that these movies were cheaply produced prevent you from appreciating their intrinsic value not only as entertainment, but also as thoughtful little excursions in their own right.

1393921,1,B000054OV3,"""Creature From the Haunted Sea"" was a Roger Corman improvised monster cheapie made as an afterthought while he was in Puerto Rico after he shot ""Battle of Blood Island"" and ""Last Woman on Earth"" (which is why ""Last Woman on Earth"" features the same cast as ""Creature From the Haunted Sea""). The results are a choppy mess that defines the monster-musical-spy-comedy-spoof genre for the 1960's. I had to watch this one in multiple sittings despite the very short running time.

The film opens to the sonorous tune of flatulent woodwinds and silly animation. In disguise, secret agents XK-120 and XK-150 (who also provides the film's attempt at continuity via his incoherent narration) meet in a bar. Agent XK-120 has a decoder ring, and the plot quickly delves into the Cuban revolution (while the soundtrack sounds as if Gene Krupa had invaded Cuba) and a plot to loot the Cuban treasury. After a subplot about sharpened garden rakes, the Cubans give the bulk of their treasury to trustworthy American mobsters led by Antony Carbone as Renzo Capetto. Ponder. Fortunately XK-150 is on the case to tell us what's happening, although it still makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. XK-150 also keeps the loyal Cuban resistance informed by making a radio out of hot dogs and dill pickles. I am not joking. The Cuba stuff is just awful.

Where will the film go from there, you may well ask. The principal cast gets on a boat from Cuba, and the journey takes days: it's 198 miles from Miami to Havana. To the tune of lots of schizophrenic xylophone music, Pete, a gangster, does animal impressions (his favorite is the Himalayan yak), Cuban comic relief General Tostada becomes a target of many hilarious translating errors, and (finally) there is a murder onboard, which is quickly blamed on the rake monster.

The beauty of the movie, though, is there really is a rake monster, which is a creature of staggering comic proportions, complete with ping pong ball eyes. He immediately targets the boat, which sets a course for monster avoidance. The Cuba plot and sea monster plot do not go together like peanut butter and chocolate; they're more like battery acid and lye. As the sea monster plot eclipses the Cuban revolution plot, the film officially becomes a train wreck.

Onboard the boat the General wants to go to Caracas, the mandatory wily female, Mary-Belle, wants to go to Cannes, someone else wants to go to Bali, Indonesia, and Renzo wants to go to San Juan. XK-150 reports that they are going to Bali, and recommends an intercept in the Panama canal, whereupon the Cuban Coast Guard pursues the boat to get their gold back. This chase gives rise to the most painful scene of the film, when tone deaf Mary-Belle belts out a tune that is really and truly one of the worst songs I have ever heard anywhere. The Coast Guard intercept also gives rise to an unfortunate gunfight, and an even more unfortunate fish fight.

The crime boss conjures a very obscure plan involving running the ship aground, and then capsizing it (?), so he hypnotizes the animal husbandry expert to help execute the plan. Unfortunately, despite all the careful planning, the boat collides with the monster and they try to abandon ship right there: you know, where the monster is. XK-150 takes this all in stride and compares it with some time he spent on Lake Minnetonka. Fortunately the cast boards a lifeboat and alights on an abandoned island near San Juan, whereupon an extremely complex plan for hiding the gold unfolds.

After the most painful collect call in screen history, the cast busies themselves with island habitation. Pete finds his Puerto Rican love connection, and their mating ritual is something you do not want anything to do with. The male cast members end up with Puerto Rican women thanks to a matronly matchmaker named Porcina and her daughter Mango: it helps for the matchmaking bit if you know some elementary Spanish. It doesn't make it any better, but it makes it more comprehensible.

It becomes a race to dive on the boat for the gold: Cuban frogmen are diving the wreck. Renzo dives the wreck, finds the strongbox; at the same time the monster finds him, therefore, the monster has found the strongbox. (Question: why are they diving with both spears and toilet plungers? Follow up: what does the monster want with the gold?) In a foreshadowing of ""Jaws"", the monster takes Mango underwater, and the movie ends with an annoying monster-infested screamfest that is sure to annoy.  I'm pretty tolerant of bad movies, but the plot resolution here is too much to take: it is both confusing and stupid.

I love B-movies of all eras and genres, but this is one of the toughest I have ever sat through. I have endured most of the Corman catalog, and believe this to be his worst film ever, and that's saying something. From the terrible and incoherent narration (""It was dusk. I could tell because the sun was going down.""), to the ridiculous monster, to the brainless script, awful acting, relentless soundtrack, and inept secret agent, this was a turkey of enormous proportions.",1265068800,5,5081,4.817660550458716

1393923,2,B000054OV3,"No one watches a Roger Corman film with the expectation that it will have a coherent script, solid production values, or memorable performances. Done on the cheap, his films were calculated to draw a teenage audience with clever titles and flashy posters that inevitably promised more than they delivered. Some are better, some are worse, and some are intended to be funny.  The 1961 CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA was among those intended to be funny--but there are only about ten minutes of comical in the film.  The rest of it is slow moving and silly in a very tiresome sort of way.

Renzo (Antony Carbone), Mary-Belle (Betsy Jones-Moreland), and their henchmen are hired to smuggle a crate of Cuban gold off the island.  Once at sea, Renzo and his bozos (Beach Dickerson and Robert Bean) decide to get rid of the Cuban guards by killing them one by one and laying the blame on an imagined sea monster.  But there really is a sea monster, and he is just as content to munch on Renzo and company as he is on Cubans.

There are actually two good things about the film.  Carbone and Jones-Moreland, both of whom went on to significant careers, tear a page from the Bogart and Bacall film KEY LARGO, and they both do a fairly amusing job of impersonating those performers--even if Jones-Moreland is really more Clair Trevor than Lauren Bacall.  And while Robert Bean isn't a greatly memorable actor, he's certainly a memorable hunk who really should have busted out of the B-horror-movie trade and taken up skin flicks instead.  He could have a fortune.

That said, the whole movie looks as if it was shot on a budget of a buck and a quarter.  As for the sea monster, it looks pretty much like a scuba diver wrapped up in somebody's old carpet with a couple of pingpong balls attached for eyes.  Yes, it is supposed to be funny.  No, it isn't.  Unless you're a fan of Corman flicks or one of the stars, do yourself a favor and give it a miss.

Story line and plot, is a monster movie concerning a Government Agent (Robert Towne) is chasing gangster Renzo Capeto (Anthony Carbone),a mobster likeness to Bogart who along with his fiance (Betsy Jones Moreland) and underlings are aboard ship with a group of exiled Cubans --- Renzo schemes a plot to invent a mythical sea monster to eliminate the Cubans and steal the national treasure --- The film is a horror comedy blending parody, humor and suspense. The comedy has some moments here and there --- Clearly this film was never meant to be taken as seriously as some seem to take it --- The biggest flaw with it however is it's too slow-moving...it takes forever before we get any kind of resolution --- The highly entertaining rampage of the Monster at the end does make up for somewhat for the slow opening half --- But once again I recommend this only for Corman staunchest fans.

Creature from the Haunted Sea is yet another B-movie triumph adopted by the fans over at Legend Films (I suspect that Mike Nelson's presence there has an influence).  Like the responsible and doting parents that they are, they've applied their trademarked nurturing to Creature, cleaning up the existing black and white version of the film and imbuing it with full color for the first time in its nearly fifty year history.

Can't decide between sticking with the classic black and white or experimenting with this new color version?  You don't have to, because both are included on the same disc--for essentially the same money as other black and white only DVDs (at the time of this review).

this IS indeed the colour version and also has the director introducing the film and making of voice commentary from 2 of the actors as well which as a great bonus.

i first saw this film on sci-fi free tv ages back and then went to amazon.co.uk. to buy the dvd...of which i bought 2 versions trying to find the colour version [the last one had a false description that it was in colour...when that arrived it was a black and white version]

this is the only version i have found that is the original colour print and NOT a black and white copy like all the other dvd's out there.

I really can't put my finger on what i really like about this film but i have 3 versions of this at home now so there must be 'something' special about it! Maybe it's the idea of the storyline and making the sci'fi
side of it believable much more than ""i am legend"" or ""the omega man"".

I would say if your going to get this film then this is the dvd set to opt for over all the overs as it's the only one in colour and has the making of extras plus 2 more films  on the disc as well.

Corman was wise in this case.  Realizing he had a stupid looking monster and that people were gonna laugh at this film anyway, he made it a comedy.  The goofy animated opening credits let you know this immediately.  Hey, might as well laugh with it, right?  Folks stranded on an island(more like sabotaged and lured) have to deal with a murderous sea monster that makes an elementary school play costume look like something on a Jerry Schmuckheimer level.  In one scene you can see the creature wearing flippers as it swims.  Too bad it doesn't live up to the cool cover art.  The comedy is hit and miss, I guess it all depends on your taste.  The film itself hasn't aged all that well.  It's quite grainy and you have to turn up the volume rather loud to hear it well.

The narrater of the film is also the secret agent of the movie. You think James Bond had cool stuff? Well this dude doesn't need Q. He makes his own stuff. He has a radio made of frankfurters and pickles! His insight is deeper than the sea itself. ""The sun was beginning to set. I could tell because it was getting dark"". That's observationm at it's finest. I'm glad he's on our side!

OK the movie is about escaping Cuba with a strongbox full of gold from the Cuban treasury. The crooks are trying to double-cross the Cubans as they escape. They try to scare the Cubans with stories of a monster, but there is a real monster!!!

The characters in this movie are entertaining and draw you in like a fish on the line. The head crook thinks he is Humprhey Bogart filming a remake of Key Largo. His main squeeze is a stacked blonde with enough sass for five golddiggers. There is another dude who communicates in animal sounds only, and another henchman talks somewhere between Popeye and Froggy from 'Our Gang'.

Now for the monster. He is an indescribable horror! Large bulging eyes (that resemble ping pong balls), giant claws for hands (Which resemble yard rakes from Sears Robuck), a huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth (the mouth cannot move or close), and a huge shaggy body (which resembles a cross between a fur coat and a guile suit worn by a US Marine Corps sniper). Simply horrifying.

This movie must be watched at least 10 times to fully appreciate it. You will see something different every time.",1178236800,21,1645,4.562711864406779
1393941,2,B000054OV3,"Usual plot and very cheesey, very cheesey!!! the monster is someone in a wetsuit with those googley eyes and spikes for claws, very low budget and the special effects are recorded animal sounds... kills some time but not that great",1172361600,2,231,4.8
1393942,2,B000054OV3,"Famous schlockmeister Roger Corman produced this film in 1961 between films such as ""The Wasp Woman"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  This cheaply made movie is filled with corny jokes, including the monster itself, and would have been perfect drive-in theater fare, as long as it was the third movie or later.

We learn that a group of Cuban soldiers have robbed the Cuban treasury of a chest of gold.  Recall that Castro had just taken over in Cuba and many people were fleeing the country with any valuables they could take.  The soldiers ask a smuggler to get them out of the country with their gold.  The smuggler and his crew decide to kill the Cubans one-by-one by pretending a monster is killing the soldiers.  The plot works until we learn that the monster is real!  At this point you can almost hear Elvira or her equivalent making some scary sound to indicate the depths of horror in this film.  However, we already know that the monster is about as scary as a guy in a fake fur coat with ping pong ball eyes can be - which is to say, not very scary.

This movie is filled with cheesy jokes.  How about a telephone on a ""deserted"" island that has two guys in suits waiting to use it?  How about a secret agent whose radio is disguised as fishing equipment?  How about a secret agent with the mysterious name of XK-150?  I think you get the idea.  Some of the corny jokes actually work, though the pseudo ""Sea Hunt (1958-1961)"" narration by secret agent XK-150 generally did not work.

What surprised me was how many well-known people were in this film.  Robert Towne played secret agent XK-150.  Towne acted in several other movies, including ""The Pick-Up Artist,"" but made his name as a screenwriter on movies such as ""The Firm,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" and ""Mission: Impossible 2.""  Antony Carbone, the leader of the smugglers, appeared regularly on a variety of popular television shows until his retirement in 1991.  Beach Dickerson played one of the crooks.  He also appeared in a variety of movies and television shows until his retirement in 1991.  Other actors with extensive resumes also appeared in this film.

I have seen movies worse than this one.  Not many, but some.  Some of the jokes did work.  Roger Corman prevented the movie from taking itself too seriously, which is probably why the movie still has some charm.  The monster is incredibly improbable and cheesy and not in the least scary.  The ending of the movie is more puzzling than anything.  I think my reaction at the end of the movie was, ""huh?""  On the other hand, if you like schlock horror films, this movie should absolutely be on your list.  Certainly fans of Roger Corman will want this one.  This movie could even be a fun one to watch if you like to make fun of movies; there is a lot of material to work with in this one.

Good Luck!",1167264000,2,2830,4.542574257425742
1393943,5,B000054OV3,"The movies weren't classics, the acting and scripts were average at best.  So why would anyone be interested in these three films shot 45 years ago?  If you know any of the people involved, if you are a movie fan, if you recognize the name of the director Roger Corman, then you will want this DVD.

Corman himself doesn't interact with anyone in a commentary, but does give some interesting background at the beginning of each film.  He has no pretensions about the work, but tells us exactly what he was trying to do and what he had to go through to accomplish it.  It's great to hear his views on all three films.

My favorite revelation is that Corman first thought of Allison Hayes (the 50 Foot Woman herself) as the lead in the THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH, but after seeing Betsy Jones-Moreland in a play, decided to offer her the role instead.

The main delight here is THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH.  The movie itself is a low budget mishmosh.  The glory on this DVD is the commentary by its stars Betsy Jones-Moreland and Antony Carbone.  They are joined by Steve Latshaw and Fred Olen Ray.  If you are tired of ""educated"" commentaries that build films up into things they were never meant to be - listen to the struggles of Moreland and Carbone.  All situations were met with impunity.  They frankly discuss co-star Edward Wain - who is in reality future Academy-Award winning screenwriter Robert Towne.

The movie is shown in widescreen (as is THE CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA) and for the first time in many years in Eastman color.

All the movies are fun (CREATURE has a commentary by Moreland, Carbone, and Latshaw).

Director-writer Joel M. Rapp does a commentary for the third film, a war movie called BATTLE OF BLOOD ISLAND.

Extras include a photo album that actually shows lobby cards rather than stills, trailers from 11 Corman films, extra scenes filmed for the movies to add time when they were marketed for television a few years later, and individual trailers for the trilogy films.

But if ANY of these titles are familiar to you, or you are interested in this era of filming, this disc, at a bargain price, will make a fine evening's entertainment!",1136937600,26,2165,4.608355091383812
1393944,5,B000054OV3,I really like this movie alot it is very funny.  If you like a movie you can just laugh away at this the movie for you. You can laugh at almost every scene in the movie.

1393945,2,B000054OV3,"In Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters from the 1960's , writer Charles B. Griffiths (who penned Creature from the Haunted Sea ) admitted that the monster in this movie cost 50 bucks. It consisted, he said , of a fur coat, some ping pong balls for eyes, and garden claws for hands.

If you watch it in this shrugging context, and go in with lowered expectations ( that is, just to have fun ) this movie is an example of what Corman and his team did best at this time. Movies that second-billed on a drive in while you were trying to retrieve a jordan almond from the back of your date's throat.

Its not the best or worst example  of the lot (and the beginning shots of  cubans photographed in heavy shadow almost ALWAYS puts me to sleep), but what the heck.

1393947,1,B000054OV3,"I do believe that I'm a serious connoisseur of B-Movie 50's schlock, going all the way back to the early days of ""Creature Feature"" and ""Chiller Theater"" on the East Coast.  I have an extensive collection of it as well on both DVD and VHS. So I feel I know that of which I speak.  Some B movies prove themselves to be fairly well acted, directed and entertaining. And as we all know, there are movies that are ""So bad, they're good"".  Plan Nine from Outer Space and Robot Monster would certainly fit into that category  Then are those flicks that are SO bad that they're just plain BAD.  CFHS proves to be that kind of movie.

  As far as Roger Corman goes, I enjoy most of his movies and own a few of them, ""The Day the World Ended"" and ""The Attack of the Crab Monsters"" to name a couple.  But I don't know what Roger was thinking when he cranked out this 74 minutes of inane drivel.  I couldn't figure out if it was a horror flick pretending to be a comedy or the other way around.  I could see the attempt at satire.  But for satire to be successful, you need to be funny.  ""Dr. Strangelove"" is an example of satire taken to perfection.  But in this case, it just didn't work.

  I mean where do I begin?  The guy that spoke in animal sounds wasn't funny.  It was just embarrassingly lame.  The cartoonish characters that show up out of nowhere on a supposedly deserted isle only added to the stupidity.  The only saving grace was the ""creature"" itself.  It was so ridiculous as to be laughable.  I only hope for Corman's sake that that was the intent.  Trying to watching this flick all the way through got to the point where it was actually becoming physically painful.

  In conclusion, let me say that I respect the other reviewers that enjoyed CFHS.  As they say, ""To each his own"".  I for my part think that you could force confessions out of hardened criminals by forcing them to watch this over and over.  But then that would be deemed cruel and unusual punishment!",1115424000,2,1976,4.3342465753424655
1393948,1,B000054OV3,"Well, this is the first time I consider Roger Corman as comedy. I always take and enjoy his work seriously. Maybe I was wrong; he can also make me laugh.

I agree with other reviewer. Do not take this tittle seriously. Yes there's a monster creature, with silly form, silly furs, and silly eyes. It reminds me to ""It came from the outerspace"" creatures. The story goes about dirty plan of an american mob who want to take fortune from his passangers and put the blame on a mystical sea creature. What surprise is, the creature do exist and terrorize the gang.

I don't know, why it is consider horror movie. It looks like ""Gilligan Island"" to me.",1114214400,,646,4.466101694915254
