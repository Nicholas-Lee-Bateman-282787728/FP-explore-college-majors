In these two series and a special we follow Nigella and her menus, parties and cooking for Christmas. Her children are seen partaking of the fun, and then her friends. Her friends seem to recur in Series Two and the Christmas Special. The fun and glamour that Nigella explores, gives us all a feel of the holiday spirit. She cooks and bakes a variety of foods, some for gifts and the others for special meals. From turkeys, to roast beef and steak. She has a menu that she prepares for all. Nigella likes to prepare as much as she can before the meal. Her cocktails compliment each meal, and while her guests are enjoying cocktails she makes the appetizer, then main course and then brings out a glorious dessert.

We see her home and how she decorates. She brings us shopping with her to her small and big shops. In one episode she gives us meals she has had in Paris. As many of us do, she reveals memories of growing up and the custom and traditions of her youth,and the ones she has made as an adult. She has a girl's night out for cocktails, but them brings them home for a meal. This is a warm and entertaining look at the holidays at Christmas. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I saw them via Acorn TV, but would love to purchase this for my daughter.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-10-15",1449705600,2,1456,4.385185185185185

It's a little dorky, but I like the 'plotlines' they write up for each episode, because you can imagine the Christmas dinner preparation timeline in your own life that way.  I might not be popping out for drinks (replace with walking dog), but it helps me see the timeline she's working under.",1389657600,,328,4.7368421052631575
8492573,5,B0064FA9VU,"I will watch this dvd every year to get me into the spirit of Christmas cooking and making the occasion special.  I love Nigella's energy and over the top enthusiasm and her descriptive words!  Also, she loves her food and calories without apologies - and shortcuts like using disposable roasting pans!  Useful and refreshing!  Visually, the producers have done an excellent job with the colours and photography.  Only Nigella could pull off Christmas holiday cooking to look so beautiful and easy.  But be aware that if you are looking for all recipes to have specific amounts, you might be better off buying a cookbook.",1385164800,3,621,4.923076923076923
8492574,5,B0064FA9VU,"Got to give it up to the directors and producers of this set. They really knew how to make one that captures your attention. So entertaining, and yet cozy feeling, like you want to curl up on the couch witn a hot cuppa and watch it. Just love it.",1359504000,2,246,4.040816326530612
