8254673,1,B001452BZC,"I knew this was a foreign movie when I bought it, but I thought that it would at least have english subtitles since I'd read english reviews that remarked at how good the movie was.

I am a huge fan of the USA network's series, La Femme Nikita, that was popular many years ago.  I've seen the French movie, Nikita, (that included subtitles, mind you) which was the mother of the series and the other movie knock-offs, including this one and the American version, Point of No Return, starring Bridget Fonda.  I thought this version would be a nice addition to my collection.  I tried watching it, but couldn't understand a word since it's all in Chinese - even the Americans in the movie speak Chinese.

So, I'm disappointed.  No english subtitles.  The movie was over-acted.  The beginning scene of the movie was a big mess - just didn't make any sense (even with english subtitles this scene would have been very hokey).  The sound quality was bad, too.",1237334400,4,954,4.597633136094674
8254674,4,B001452BZC,"BLACK CAT (1991) is a prime example of the kind of over-the-top action thriller that made Hong Kong cinema famous worldwide in the early 1990s. An uncredited remake of Luc Besson's LA FEMME NIKITA (1990), it's actually a much more inspired film as it tells the story of an out-of-control young woman who falls into the hands of a special CIA unit which trains and programs her to be a highly efficient assassin, only to watch helplessly as she falls in love and starts to resist her programming. In the early scenes, she's a psychotic, unstoppable force who cuts a bloody swath through the Pacific Northwest that leaves at least three people dead and many more wounded. In the next stage, her wild impulses and erratic emotions block the early efforts of the CIA trainers to tame her. Finally, when the seeming kindness of her handler touches hidden reserves of humanity in her, she plunges into a love affair in the final section of the film with the same fierce energy and passion she'd shown in her other actions.

Through it all, Jade Leung, the model-turned-actress playing the role of Catherine, later renamed Erica by her trainers, displays the kind of unrestrained physicality and emotional range that would scare off more accomplished actresses. Whether she's fighting back against abusive police guards with raw fury, screaming at her handler (Simon Yam) for what she thinks is an act of betrayal, or making adoring love to the boyfriend (Thomas Lam) she meets in Hong Kong, Ms. Leung never fails to completely inhabit her character and make every shift and transformation she undergoes thoroughly believable. Even though it's her own willful act of violent aggression at the very beginning that provokes the horrible chain of events, she somehow manages to win our sympathies throughout. And even though the actress is doubled for the toughest stunts, she still seems to take an awful lot of risks.

There are plenty of audacious action scenes you would never find in a Hollywood counterpart, starting with Catherine's vicious brawl at a roadside diner with a trucker who's gotten rough with her and her battles with police guards while under arrest, and moving on to the killings she performs on assignment, including one jaw-dropping shooting at an outdoor wedding party and one clever maneuver at a Hong Kong construction site where her target's change in plans requires some quick thinking and agile legwork on her part as she climbs up a giant crane high atop the city to improvise a last-minute method of execution. All while her boyfriend is sitting in a movie theater waiting for her to come back to her seat.

It's not for the faint of heart. The violence in the opening 20 minutes is reckless, messy, bloody and brutal, the way violence generally is. We don't get the more stylized choreographed setpieces until midway through the film and the outdoor wedding scene where over a dozen guests suddenly pull out automatic weapons and begin firing at the fleeing assassin and chase her into the woods. The subsequent hits in Hong Kong and Japan are all quite imaginatively staged.

If you're already a Hong Kong action fan and you haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to get this great new edition from Fortune Star's Legendary Collection line. It was followed by a sequel, BLACK CAT 2: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT YELTSIN (1992), that was equally over-the-top in its action scenes, but didn't quite have the heart of this film. The sequel is also out on DVD now.",1215302400,5,3485,4.871838111298482
8254675,2,B001452BZC,"This is a far inferior Hong Kong re-make of La Femme Nikita in which Jade Leung plays ""Black Cat"", a young drifter who is trained as an assassin after being taken into a secret organization. Leung is decent in her first role, but plays the part mostly through facial expressions - there aren't a lot of lines for her. Simon Yam, who is always fun to watch, plays her boss. Expect a lot of Hong Kong style action, with over the top violence and brutal fights. Unfortunately, the acting by the Caucasian cast is absolutely dreadful and seriously detracts from the overall movie. Pretty mediocre movie in the long run.",1010620800,,615,4.6
8254676,3,B001452BZC,"This is the best in a series of Hong Kong attempts to [emulate] La Femme Nakita (titles of others are escaping me).  Don't let this turn you off if you are thinking this is going to be like that horrible Hollywood Bridget Fonda vehicle- Hong Kong will always do it better.  I have friends that say this is better than the original, but I wouldn't go that far.  I believe this is Jade Leung's first major role and she is great.  She is not only beautiful, but can act.  She makes this movie.  In fact they made a sequel of this film due to it's popularity in HK.
Jade plays a Chinese-American who gets in a scrap at a truck stop and accidently kills a cop.  She is then killed by assasins, or is she.  The CIA has actually taken her, put a chip in her to enhance her physical prowess, and now she is an assasin for them.  She falls in love along the way and ...
The funny thing about this movie is that I think it was filmed entirely over seas, but the first half is suppossed to take place in the US.  So the entire first half is in English, even parts where the story is in HK are in English.  Otherwise the usual weird/absurd subtitle translations are in effect.  Overall DVD quality is very good.",993772800,9,1199,4.165217391304348
8254677,4,B001452BZC,"Okay, it's a little annoying when people claim that Point of No Return was the second remake of La Femme Nikita.  Black Cat was made in 1991 while Point was made in 1993.  While Point was an almost blow by blow recreation  of Nikita, Black Cat took the essential structure and gave it a different  spin.  Now, that's what I call a remake, what's the point of a blow by blow  remake?  Black Cat can never replace Nikita for me, I do think Nikata is a  superior film.  However, Black Cat has Jade and the film's biggest charm is  the strength of the then newcomer to the movies.  She brings a different  intensity and understated fraility to the character.  Not that Anne  Parillaud was bad, she was very good, but she didn't make me want to go out  there and watch every film she has ever made.  Black Cat has nice action  sequences courtesy of HK.  It's focus is completely different from Nikita,  it's more an action film then an exploration of what it feels to be  trapped.  There will be some of us who'll like, even love, Black Cat.  There will be many who'll dislike it.  There is a reason this film is  called a cult classic not a classic.  NOT everyone will like this film.  Just bear in mind, if you intend to watch this film, watch it with an open  mind and don't try and compare it with it's predecessor and you might see  why Black Cat became a cult classic and Point of no Return didn't.",953337600,3,1399,4.276923076923077
