882176,5,6304457391,"""Seven Days in May"" is a gripping political drama surrounding efforts of an American President to eliminate stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the midst of the cold war.  He is opposed by a demagogic army general  (B. Lancaster), whose chief of staff is a marine colonel (K.  Douglas).
Tactile suspense develops as clues about behind the scenes  military activities pop up here and there that lead one to guess that plans  are in effect that could undermine the basic principles of self-government  upon which the US Constitution is based.
Tensions of the cold war years  are presented and preserved in this film, filmed and presented in black and  white.  As you watch this film you will notice that the special effects are  not what they are today (there are few of them, anyway), since the center  of this movie is philosophical rather than a visceral viewing experience.  And that's fine...you will, regardless, find yourself drawn into the story  as the plans of the primary protagonist (the president), and his antagonist  (the army general) face off.
This is top-notch drama.  The most  important figure in the film is Douglas, who is caught between loyalty to  his superior officer and his loyalty to the constitution and to his  country.  This film explores gray areas...come along for the ride.
This  is the sort of film that makes you wonder if this kind of event may  actually have taken place.
While this film is excellent, it may not be  for everyone.  If you are someone who must have non-stop action, explosions  (a la ""The Terminator"" etc.), then this film is NOT for you.  If  you are a thoughtful viewer though, you will thoroughly enjoy this gripping  film.
5 stars all the way for the story, character development, acting,  and dramatic suspense.
Don't miss this film!

882177,3,6304457391,"Maybe I'm just letting my own political bias color my judgment, but it seems to me that this movie has a bit of a pretentious edge that the novel had less of.  You can spot the moments right away where Rod Serling  decided to pontificate (President Lyman's rattling about the ""nuclear  age"").  I think what amuses me the most though is what this movie  left out from the novel.  In the novel, President Lyman is forced to  confront the fact that the reason behind General Scott's plot, the fear of  the Soviets cheating on a disarmament treaty, is borne out completely.  In  the end, what makes Lyman's appeals to the rule of law powerful are when he  points out to Scott that he will end up reacting to this crisis no  differently than Scott would upon illegally siezing power.  And that is  the one thing that is sadly missing from this movie and it's absence hurts  the film completely from my standpoint.
On the plus side, Kirk Douglas is  outstanding as Jiggs Casey, whose character is improved from the novel, and  there are other fine performances too (Ava Gardner though looks haggard and  aged).  It's too bad though that Serling's desire for pontificating mars  the film from my standpoint.",958867200,20,1200,4.650717703349282
882178,5,6304457391,"I saw this film in theater, because this was the first novel I had read in English.  Though We japanese have different constitution, this film attracted me very much. Col. Casey's charactor seems somewhat different  from novel's one. In novel he was close to ordinary citizen tightly tied to  his family, so it was great for him  to dare his carreer and betray? his  boss to follow constitution. So confrontation between douglas and Lancaster  is only in film not in novel. The address of POTUS was well prepared and  good performance I'd ever seen.",951868800,4,549,4.776595744680851
882179,5,6304457391,"Seven Days In May is indeed Frankenheimer at his best.

882180,5,6304457391,"With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas pitted against each other under the direction of John Frankenheimer, this movie could not be less than excellent.
In the daily friction that often exists between the military  and executive branches, this movie is as timeless as the year it was  released shortly after JFK's assination.  In a military setting, Douglas's  character faithfully serves Lancaster's only to find out he is left on the  outside of a master coup d'etat of the United States government.
Fredrick  March's portrayal of the President is stellar.  The tension and emotion  generated between these three characters is quality acting rarely achieved.  The final confrontation between Douglas and Lancaster is one of the best  lines ever recorded in film.",945734400,19,762,5.275
882181,5,6304457391,"Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, and Frederick March are outstanding in this thiller about the attempted takeover of the government by the military.  It is a movie that will keep you in your seat as the tension mounts, and boy,  does it ever mount!  The entire cast is terrific.
Burt Lancaster plays  the popular general, Kirk Douglas his adjutant, and Fredrick March as the  unpopular president.  Douglas accidently picks up information on a secret  military maneuver, and because he has been left out of the `loop', decides  to investigate.  The deeper he probes, the more sinister it all  appears.
Although most of these great political thrillers were made at  the height of the cold war, don't let the political changes sway you in not  seeing this motion picture.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Between 1  and 10, ""Seven Days in May"" gets a 10.",930614400,6,853,4.826388888888889

882303,5,6304457391,"""Seven Days in May"" is a serious movie supported by President Kennedy who read the book offered the White House for the filming -- against the desires of the Pentagon Generals.  The stellar ALL STAR casting is unreal and the acting exceptional.  The military is attempting to overthrow the government potentially rendering the Constitution null and void.  Purposely filmed in black and white to add to the drama, this movie is chocked full of suspense and intrigue -- a forgotten gem that is a must watch!

882304,5,6304457391,The movie presents the possibility of a military coup within the United States. The coup's basis is the mutual suspicion generated within the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union of the early 1960s. The climatic scene in which Burt Lancaster as teh general leading the plotters confronts Kirk Douglas as the colonel who discovered the plot is dramatically compelling and technologically prescient. When confronted by the general with his jingoistic authoritarian vision of patriotism the colonel replies with a compelling defense of deference to the rule of law. This confrontation takes place in front of several monitors in a Pentagon hallway all showing Frederic March as the president speaking to teh US nation about the need to defend democracy from the certainties of ambitions men. The technology of the electronic  media to spread interaction without regard to distance is presciently shown throughout the movie.,1514678400,2,928,5.312925170068027

882575,5,6304457391,"I recently re-watched this movie after buying the blu ray, and I was reminded of what a good, taut, suspenseful political thriller it is.  But it's also interesting to see what a definite product of its time it was.  This film was made hard on the heels of the Cuban Missile Crisis, at the very height of the Cold War.  Today, that seems like ancient history to a lot of people -- perhaps even to some of the people who lived through it.  For those of us born after the baby boomer generation, nuclear weapons have been a fact for our entire lives.  It's easy to lose sight of what a new and horrifying development they were for people back in the mid-century era, and how large they loomed in everyone's consciousness.  We've lived with their existence now for almost three quarters of a century, and perhaps that has made us complacent in a way that people back in the sixties were not, when the specter of nuclear annihilation had only been around for a few short years.  So it's natural that the plot to this movie should revolve around the threat of nuclear weapons, and the idea of a disarmament treaty, especially given that the script was written by Rod Serling.  Just think how many episodes of the original ""Twilight Zone"" were about a nuclear apocalypse, the threat of a nuclear apocalypse, or the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse (e.g. ""The Shelter,"" ""Two,"" ""Third from the Sun,"" ""One More Pallbearer,"" ""The Old Man in the Cave,"" ""Probe 7 Over and Out,"" ""Time Enough At Last""), or remember the ending to the original ""Planet of the Apes,"" (whose script was also written by Serling), with its famous twist ending, where Charlton Heston's stranded astronaut, Taylor, discovers he's been back on Earth the whole time -- an Earth where the apes displaced us because we pushed the button and blew ourselves back to the stone age.  There was a real, pervading sense in those days, when nuclear weapons were new and gave us a capability that we'd never had before -- to wipe out human civilization, and perhaps the human species itself in one horrifying spasm -- that it was virtually INEVITABLE we'd destroy ourselves, given our warlike history.  All it would take would be one catastrophic mistake -- and we are a species prone to making those.  Three quarters of a century have given us a perspective they didn't have then.  We know today that as terrifying as it was, Mutual Assured Destruction DID actually work!  The Cold War ended, and as close as we got to the brink, we didn't go over it, because ultimately, we weren't suicidal and neither were the Soviets or the Red Chinese.  This is not to say all danger is passed, but today the threat can realistically be assessed as significantly less grave than it was during the mid-twentieth century.

But this movie was made back when the threat was quite new, and seemed quite dire, and as I said, the plot revolves around the struggle between two factions, one who believes deterrence is the only answer, and the other, which believes that only disarmament would end the danger.  (Spoilers ahead!)  Frederic March plays U.S. President Jordan Lyman, a believer in disarmament.  He is absolutely convinced of the inevitability of nuclear war if both sides don't disarm, and signs a treaty to eliminate the U.S. nuclear arsenal.  Burt Lancaster plays Air Force General James Matoon Scott, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a well-known and very popular war hero, who believes the opposite: that disarmament is inexcusably nave; that the Soviets, who have a long history of breaking treaties, cannot be trusted to honor this one; that once America scraps its arsenal, but the Soviets keep theirs, then war would indeed be inevitable, but so also would total defeat.  (I have to say personally, that I agree with the second premise: disarmament and disarmament treaties have a poor track record -- the democracies voluntarily disarmed between the two world wars, and signed disarmament treaties [e.g. the Washington Naval Treaty], but the dictatorships armed themselves and made war against enemies who looked weak and unwilling to fight.  The ancient Romans got it right all those centuries ago: si vis pacem para bellum.)  General Scott is so convinced of the sheer folly of Lyman's course, that he resolves to seize control of the government.  Caught in the middle is Scott's aide, marine colonel ""Jiggs"" Casey, who fully agrees with Scott's assessment of the folly of disarmament, but is repelled at the thought of overthrowing the legitimately elected government of the United States and installing a military junta.  Casey realizes, correctly, that it's a cure far worse than the disease.  It would mean throwing away the rule of law, and the political stability and peaceful transfer of power that the U.S. has enjoyed for two centuries, and would entail the U.S. becoming just another banana republic, with all the corruption and political instability that would bring.  It could lead to a government as repressive and authoritarian as that of the Soviets.  So, despite his misgivings about Lyman's policy, Casey works to uncover and thwart the conspiracy before the coup d'tat can take place.

This is a great movie, with superb direction and pacing, outstanding performances from a stellar cast, and a great, suspenseful story, and finally, is a superb window to the dangers and concerns of the Cold War era.  It comes highly recommended.",1500854400,3,5414,4.860718171926006

882659,5,6304457391,"Seven Days in May is a political thriller about an attempted military coup of the United States. Set during the nuclear age and the anxiety and fear it produced, the movie focuses on three key characters, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), U.S. President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March), and Col. Martin Jiggs Casey (Kirk Douglas), the man who discovers a dangerous plot may be brewing.

Lyman has just signed a treaty with the Soviet Union to disarm all nuclear weapons. The public is unhappy, calling the move foolish. Scott believes the Presidents decision has left the country at a strategic disadvantage and has, along with several other military leaders, planned a secret plot to seize power.  Most of the movie deals with Col. Casey learning bit by bit of the complicated plot, deciding how to act, and convincing others that the plot is real.

Director John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate) and writer Rod Serling have fashioned a gripping, dramatic what if scenario, very much a product of its time. It still packs a powerful punch, and Lancaster and Douglas are excellent. Lancasters Scott conveys both authority and arrogance, while Douglas Casey, whos Scotts right-hand man, runs through a range of emotions  admiration, loyalty, doubt, concern, and determination. Hes the man in the middle  the guy responsible for preserving democracy.

A sub-plot involving blackmail features Ava Gardner, but rather than furthering the plot, it serves as an unwelcome distraction, slowing the films otherwise brisk pace.

The only bonus feature on the Blu-ray release is commentary by director John Frankenheimer.",1497312000,,1656,5.273764258555133

882743,4,6304457391,"plus factors of the 1964 political thriller ""Seven Days in May"":

1) terrific lead male cast:
-- Fredric March as the sober, intelligent but only marginally popular U.S. president who risks whatever shred of credibility and popularity he still has on a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union.

-- Burt Lancaster as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (James Mattoon Scott), a broad-shouldered, charismatic Air Force general whose ultra-patriotism masks his Fascist leanings.  He is leading a conspiracy involving three other joint chiefs to launch a coup d'tat (just seven days away) to oust the president, prevent implementation of the nuclear disarmament treaty, and to place the U.S. under military rule.

-- Kirk Douglas as the Marine Joint Staff Director (Colonel Jiggs Casey) who is kept out of the coup plot loop but picks up on enough clues to suspect that the overthrow attempt may be only one week away.  He is against the treaty himself, but as a staunch believer in the supremacy of the Constitution, he feels an absolute duty to alert the White House to his very real suspicions.

-- Edmond O'Brien as the dipsomaniac U.S. Senator from Georgia who, as the president's closest longtime friend, volunteers to go to El Paso to investigate the possible existence of General Scott's secret military base.

-- Martin Balsam as the president's top adviser, whose incredulity as to the reality of such a conspiracy motivates him to travel to Spain to find the U.S. Navy Joint Chief and obtain a signed statement  pertaining to his knowledge of the alleged impending coup and his refusal to participate in it.

2) John Frankenheimer's excellent direction of the film (his successor to ""The Manchurian Candidate"")

-- Scenes are meticulously staged and photographed for maximum involvement of the audience with the actors.

DVD bonus feature: Frankenheimer's commentary is thorough and offers a virtual primer on directing techniques for this type of film.

3) Rod Serling's cerebral screenplay adaptation of the 1962 novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II.

-- Serling was among the greatest writers for television and screen from this time period, possessing a tremendous flair for drama and suspense, well-turned dialogue and a real feeling for Cold War and conspiratorial atmospherics.

4) the production design:

-- impressively realistic Pentagon and White House interior sets; convincing use of real-time TV monitors, as well as giant-screen projection; fairly cutting-edge for its time, aided by Frankenheimer's experience in live-TV stage productions

5) moments of reality captured on film:

-- Before the opening credits there is a scene (not in the book) of dueling protest marches in front of the White House between anti-nuke and pro-nuke factions.  There is a scripted physical altercation that erupts; but at the same time it becomes real between some thuggish bystanders who force their way through and a tough-guy element among the paid extras in the scene.  A real arrest made by real cops with a real police van is captured as part of the mle.

-- Martin Balsam's presidential adviser character is filmed boarding a naval carrier without any permission for him and the film crew to do this.

minus factors:

1) The opening scene mle (a clever mood-setting device to illustrate the tension of the times over the disarmament issue) turns out to be the most action-packed scene in the film, yet it's not even part of the plot line.  This is a cerebral dialogue-packed film (i.e., it's talky).  I find the film fairly tense and suspenseful, but I cannot say that it doesn't get a bit watered down by the glut of dialogue (as good as so much of it may be).

2) The Ava Gardner role and the bizarre love triangle involving her, Jiggs Casey (Douglas) and General Scott (Lancaster), her former lover, as Casey seeks both to woo her and to probe her for incriminating info on Scott's adulterous affair with her (for possible blackmail purposes).  Every moment with her on the screen feels like a contrived attempt to force the presence of a glamorous actress into the otherwise all-male lead cast for box offices purposes.  Her melodramatic acting style and the de rigueur attempts to photograph her as a lady of glamour clash with the strongly realistic style of the rest of the film.  (In his commentary Frankenheimer explains that he only had Gardner for a week, that she could be ""difficult,"" and that a secondary screenwriter was brought in for her key-scene dialogue.  One of her lines is so bad that it still makes Frankenheimer cringe 35 years later.)

Side note: Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner and Edmond O'Brien co-starred 18 years earlier in the 1946 film noir crime drama ""The Killers.""

3) (avoiding spoilers) the ending:

-- The original ending that was filmed was taken from the novel, but it was deemed not to have come off as credible on screen.
-- The replacement ending was hastily shot later in Paris (Frankenheimer and Lancaster were in France working on their next project, ""The Train"")...and you be the judge if it is a satisfying one or not.  I really don't think so.

All in all, a suspenseful enough, very well-crafted (if talky) political thriller, with five superb acting performances (that's a lot!); but it does get sidetracked and compromised by bringing in Ava Gardner; and a solid final sequence is lacking.",1491609600,,5369,4.995505617977528

Seven Days in May stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Jiggs Casey. Colonel Jiggs Casey takes great pride and seriousness in his job. He even goes as far as to risk his own professional livelihood by telling President Jordan Lyman what he thinks is about to happen. This is serious because what Casey tells Lyman involves another supervisor General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster). This is significant because even in real-life telling a supervisor what you sense andor know can cause you great risk to your own job because there is no rule prohibiting them from telling another supervisor what you told them even with good intentions. President Lyman courteously understands the good intent behind what Colonel Jiggs Casey is doing and is careful to avoid telling Scott what Casey told him in confidence. Meanwhile, Casey also has the challenging task of gathering information from Eleanor Holbrook (Ava Gardner) who had been deeply in love with General James Mattoon Scott.",1484092800,3,1169,5.030927835051546

883654,5,6304457391,"Accin Ejecutiva / Executive Action, 1973 film

The movie begins with a quote from President Lyndon B. Johnson. He suspected a conspiracy caused the assassination of JFK. They show various industrial scenes as the credits roll. It is June 1963. A voice talks about the Kennedy Brothers and warns about their powers. JFK's actions are criticized. A Test Ban Treaty! Withdrawal from Vietnam! The men talk about an ""executive action"". We see a speech by JFK about progress for the people. They talk about presidential assassinations by fanatics. One man explains how this will work. Practice makes perfect. We hear the analysis of JFK' protection. This conspiracy will use a victim as a ""lone gunman"" to take the blame. We see men shooting at a target in a moving open car.

Newsreels from June 1963 tell about a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Jim Farrington meets one leader and explains the deal. ""You just told me who we are going to hit."" JFK speaks about Civil Rights. The conspirators have a ""sponsor"" for their plot. They review his history. They will use him. One plotter speaks about the need for population control of people in other countries. ""Somebody must be behind him."" A speech in Washington is seen by the top man. Oswald is arrested for handing out leaflets, this is photographed [advance planning]. JFK signs the Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. Men with telescopic camera lens take pictures of a parade. We see the plot taking place for Dealey Plaza. The report of a future withdrawal from Vietnam makes Ferguson give the ""go ahead"". They send a coded message to a team leader. They got the job. They use a double to impersonate the ""sponsor"" and leave a false trail. Men break into a garage to steal a rifle. They create an incriminating photograph. [Easier today with digital photography.]

Was there a plot to demonstrate against Adlai Stevenson? The assassins reconnoiter the locations. Exact planning assures success. The President and Vice-President will be in Dallas together. ""Oswald has his telephone number?"" Oswald's mail and telephone are monitored by government agencies. [Like most other people?] JFK is greeted in Fort Worth, then flies to Dallas. The people cheer him. The assassins move into their positions. We see actual news photographs mixed in with this movie. [Just like ""Twelve O'Clock High"".] People watch this live on television. The assassins fire. The police search the Texas School Book Depository building. The telephone lines go dead in Washington. [Too many calls at once.] The assassins flee Dallas separately. Oswald asks for legal assistance. On Sunday Jack Ruby goes to the police station. Oswald is shot! ""He was the killer."" There are photographs of the 18 material witnesses who died in the next three years. The odd against this randomly happening are exceedingly high.

While an assassination could be the work of a ""lone gunman"" (as `TIME' said about Lincoln's assassination), the killing of Oswald two days later suggests a conspiracy to many people. ""The Assassination Tapes"" book used a voice-stress analyzer to measure the recorded conversations and found that Oswald spoke the truth (or was insane). The removal of JFK resulted in only one change in policy. Executive Order 11,110 was reversed. This ordered the US Treasury to print $100 bills instead of using the more expensive Federal Reserve Notes. The US government has to pay the Fed for its own money!

Why is Oswald ""not guilty""? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunch time is usually around noon. If Oswald went to lunch at noon and then washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then running down four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.

Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book ""The Assassination Tapes"" explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the ""lone gunman"" theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book ""Dr. Feelgood"" explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?",1412467200,,4976,4.917857142857143

I will never comprehend the so called 'charity' of Douglas to defer the JCS Director role to Lancaster. Jigg's character was quintessential to saving the day for the USA! He had a much meatier script, showed stronger character and sensitivity and overall the much better man. How could this be seen as anything but a BRILLIANT choice!

I have followed March's career since his earliest days and appreciated his tenure in many demanding scenes, a deep talent. The interplay of such strong roles mimics the existing tete-a-tete with the MIC vs Congress. I find it eternally entertaining when I hear a presidential platform stating their goals for military presence or withdrawal.

883689,1,6304457391,"Seven Days In May is a beautifully portrayed attempted coup d'etat in Cold War America. I hate to minimize the performances given by the unbelievable cast (headlined by March, Lancaster and Douglas), but their riveting performances made this wrapped, complicated plot unfold perfectly. Rod Serling's script was executed perfectly by Frankenheimer (of ""Manchurian Candidate"" fame). As the title of my review states, the first 99% of the film outstanding.

However, the final, climactic confrontation plays-out in a horribly-contrived, boy scout-like view of how power politics truly works. Think I'm wrong? Stick with me for a couple of examples:

1) The fabled fascist coup d'etat involving the Roosevelt White House. A cadre of America's richest industry scum gathered together and plotted a takeover of Roosevelt's Presidency, which was to be led by retired Marine General Smedley Butler. The plotters wanted Butler because he was a overwhelmingly loved and respected as a soldier's general due to his non-armchair-style service. Enlisting such a strongman would placate the military (in the minds of the plotters). When Butler gathered enough names and info and exposed the entire plot, guess who paid for their treason? - no one. (""Plot To Seize the White House"" by Archer)

2) The JFK assassination. If you have yet to research the utter fabrication of an investigation conducted by the corrupt politicians and military industrial complex hacks, please do. The only man ever actually prosecuted for Kennedy's murder (Clay Shaw/Bertrand) claimed not to be a CIA asset, which was proven to be a lie after his death. None other than Dwight Eisenhower assumed it was a conspiracy and those perpetrating it would be caught. The one man who attempted to prosecute an accomplice was hounded relentlessly for his efforts by his own government and its lapdog media.

Now, back to ""Seven Days In May..."" As I stated above, it is a terrific film for the most part. It was written, directed and performed by the film making industry's best for that time and arguably is one of the greatest assemblages of casts/crews ever. However, for the film to devolve into a Sunday school lesson on how extremely powerful, politically well-heeled titans somehow actually answer for their transgressions against the US Constitution ruined this film for me. Would it be nice if the film's ending were true to real life form? Absolutely. But, it isn't. Again, if you think I am wrong about how such machinations actually play-out in this country, please do avail yourself of the research into just the two examples I gave, because I guarantee you'll find plenty more without much effort.",1403136000,6,2665,5.147806004618937

883691,4,6304457391,"An outstanding set of performances from Lancaster and Douglass carry this film. It's also directed wit confidence and verve by a young John Frankenheimer. Tense, well developed, and emotional, in a guarded, masculine way. You'll see a lot of 'A Few Good Men' in the picture. It's an accurate look at the early sixties Russian threat paranoia - but in many ways stands out as a more serious take on the same subject as Dr Strangelove. These two films would make a great companion set, more so than the often quoted 'fail/safe' because this film demonstrates how seriously the nuclear war was taken, how grim the stakes - it highlights how outrageous and satirical Strangelove really was. Even without dragging Kubrick into the conversation, this is an outstanding film from Frankenheimer, and with two of Hollywoods biggest stars in muted, darker performances than we often give them credit for.",1401148800,10,894,5.006711409395973

883738,5,6304457391,"Seven Days in May begins with a riot in front of the White House. It's the late 1960s and U.S. President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) has recently signed a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. Now, demonstrators for and against the treaty are coming to blows. The populace is afraid. The military-industrial complex feels betrayed. And the presidents approval rating has sunk to 29 percent.

In one of the opening scenes, the president talks with a sympathetic friend, Senator Raymond Clark (Edmond OBrien). He explains his reason for making the pact. Sure, the U.S. could have maintained a nice, cushy feeling that weve got a bomb for every one of theirs. But . . . thered have come one day when theyd have blown us up, or wed have blown them up.

President Lymans most forceful opponent is Air Force General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster). The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Scott is a highly decorated war hero who never misses a chance to denounce the new treaty. In one scene, he tells a congressional panel, Theres not a single piece of paper in history thats ever served as a deterrent to a Pearl Harbor. The next day, at a televised rally with thousands of veterans cheering him on, he rails against the cynics, the one-worlders, the intellectual dilettantes, those who believe that patriotism is old-fashioned and that love of country is outdated.

Scotts aide at the Pentagon is Marine Colonel Jiggs Casey (Kirk Douglas). Casey admires Scott and shares his mistrust of the Soviets. But unlike the outspoken general, Casey stays clear of any public criticism of the administration. A series of clues leads Casey to an uneasy suspicion about his boss, and he requests a meeting with the president. At the White House, Casey reports what he has recently seen and heard. Finally, when President Lyman presses him to speak candidly, the colonel tells him, Im suggesting, Mr. President, theres a military plot to take over the government.

The president regards the conspiracy theory as possible, and he calls together a small group of trusted aides and officials, including Casey, to investigate. Casey approaches Scotts former mistress, Eleanor Holbrook (Ava Gardner). Though he is genuinely attracted to her, he visits Holbrook at her apartment in order to find out what she knows about the general. Casey leaves with a stack of love letters written by Scott, letters that can be used against him. The rest of the team discovers that General Scott is, in fact, planning a coup. The scheme is impressive. Scott has set up a clandestine military base near El Paso where unknowing troops are training for seizure. A scheduled alert exercise in a few days will serve as the pretext for mobilizing the military and isolating the president. The armed forces will commandeer nation-wide communications, including the television networks. Almost all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a key member of the Senate, Frederick Prentice (Whit Bissell), are in on the plan. A popular television newsman, Harold McPherson (Hugh Marlowe) will manage the media in the replacement government.

At first, President Lyman intends to derail the conspiracy by exposing it. But General Scotts team, well organized and determined, prevents the president from assembling the evidence he needs in order to make his case to the public. Then he learns that Scott has rescheduled the alert for late Saturday night, instead of Sunday morning. With time running out, the president phones the Pentagon and demands to see the general immediately. At the White House, Lyman confronts Scott, accuses him of treason, and demands his resignation. The general first denies the plan and then defends his motives. As he leaves, the president vows to fight him.

The next day as the president holds a televised press conference, he receives word that a key piece of evidence exposing the junta has been discovered. Soon, he reports that members of the Joint Chiefs have tendered their resignations. On hearing the news, General Scott tells his driver to take him home.

The film ends with President Lyman speaking to the nation. He declares that in spite of the negative national mood, the whisperers, the detractors, the violent men are wrong. The United States is still a strong nation, strong enough to be a peacemaker. It is still a proud nation, proud enough to be patient. He concludes with the rousing prophecy that we will see a day when on this earth all men will walk out of the long tunnels of tyranny into the bright sunshine of freedom. As he leaves the podium, the press corps stands and applauds.

One of the truly great movies depicting the Cold War, Seven Days in May captures so well what seems to have been its cultural context, the attitudes and the atmosphere in America at the time. In 1960, Nixon and Lodge, who nearly won the election, had used a slogan that could have been part of the script: They Understand What Peace Demands. Two years later, in October 1962, the Cuban missile crisis heightened the nations awareness that both the U.S. and the Soviet Union possessed a large arsenal of incredibly powerful nuclear weapons, and that even an accidental first strike would likely result in retaliation leading to full escalation. In 1964, the year the film was released, such fears were the basis of a clever response to a slogan used by the Republican presidential nominee. The Barry Goldwater campaign declared, In Your Heart You Know Hes Right. Supporters of Lyndon Johnson responded with, In Your Heart You Know He Might.

More than that, the film also editorializes by presenting a vision of the sort of Americans who can guide the nation to survival and even prosperity. The film takes a side in a vital debate during the Cold War. But it also attempts to make room for the opposing side. For example, during his televised press conference, President Lyman assures his hearers of their right to dissent. Viewers overhear him say:

""Americans traditionally and historically have given vent to their views. On the date that this government does anything arbitrarily to stifle those views, it will have to change form. It will cease to be a democracy. And I can state quite frankly that this day will not come.""

Earlier, when he faces off with the general, the president never suggests that his opponents militaristic views have no merit. Although he disagrees with Scott, Lyman does not debate the generals position. What he objects to is Scotts attempt to circumvent American rules and procedures. When General Scott professes an abiding concern about the survival of this country, President Lyman responds:

""Then, by God, run for office! . . . You want to defend the United States of America. Then defend it using the tools it supplies you with, the Constitution. You ask for a mandate, General, from a ballot box. You don't steal it after midnight, when the country has its back turned.""

Colonel Casey, a third alternative, personifies a hawkish position that at the same time defends duly elected civilian authority. When the president meets with the colonel at the White House, he asks him what he thinks about General Scotts militaristic views. Casey answers:

""I agree with General Scott, Sir. I think were being played for suckers. I think its really your business, yours and the Senate. You did it and they agreed. So, well, I don't see how we in the military can question it. I mean, we can question it, but we cant fight it. . . . We shouldnt anyway.""

From the vantage point of the film, Lyman and Casey are ideal Americans. They are strong enough to act responsibly and to show respect even while they believe that they are in the right and that others are wrong. Seven Days in May seems to assume that strength and purity of character combined with uniquely-American institutions will always generate a way for the United States to prevail. Thus, the film reflects and encourages the values of that religion or folk philosophy that has been called ""Americanism.""",1395878400,,8001,4.894464944649447

883807,5,6304457391,"This film, is without a doubt, a seminal film. And, it has a amazing cast of great film and TV actors (many of whom are now deceased). John Frankenheimer really nailed it in how to treat the subject matter first identified in the book of the same name by Fletcher Knebel. Enjoy this film as it is one which should live for a long time as great examples of what Frankenheimer could do, the convincing acting of the entire cast (only a few were marginal), and the story told in such a manner that it becomes believable. In today's world, the video conferencing/video phone concept used in this film would be ancient and crude. In the 1960's, the concept was present, but the use was still a long way off. Frankenheimer seemed to grasp the seriousness of the story being told and ran with it. Films from that era look crude to those produced today, as we have more high tech special effects and can really make one feel as if they are a fly on the wall or are actually participating in the action on the screen. In 1964, Frankenheimer did the best he could with what was available to him and focused on the story and characters. He relied upon the many great actors and made it into a story which can be told today and still seem plausible.

Having been filmed in B&W, allows the story to evolve and present itself. There might be faults, as nothing is perfect, but this film is one of the first and best in what has become a long line of suspenseful films to touch upon an attack on our government.

Please read about the possibility of the focus of this film, in not only by Knebel's book, but especially in James Bamford's book, ""Body of Secrets"". True or not, the subject matter is quite intriguing.

883871,4,6304457391,"I have seen this one a couple of times. As entertainment, it has something going for it. Not many movies where the US military decides to stage a military coup.

I never really believed the basic premise that a ""liberal"" US president could just arbitrarily decide to dismantle the US nuclear arsenal through a treaty with the Soviets. That would have to get past a 1960s era Senate and the chances of that happening were nil, even if the Soviets had been willing to go along.

The basic premise seemed to be that the chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff (played by Burt Lancaster) does not trust the Soviets to abide by the terms of the treaty, something that seems like a very reasonable fear to have. So he plots a coup against the president.

There is some nonsense about a secret unit the general manages to create that is planning to take over the airwaves to broadcast the general's political views once he takes over, and some kind of broadcaster who is planning to help him.

The whole problem with this is that a coup is about being able to apply sufficient force under your own control to be able to take over. The movie never made me believe that the general was going to be able to make it stick.

OTOH, it was an interesting premise and the movie made the most of a premise that is at best a stretch.

Kirk Douglas plays a USMC colonel who is an aid to the general. He is pretty straitlaced and really too good to be true as he finds clues to the plot and tries to help squash it.

Ava Gardner plays a former mistress of the general. She seemed too old to me to be a credible mistress. There is an almost bizarre scene where Kirk Douglas tries to romance her character in an effort to get dirt on the general that was almost funny to me because it was so far out of character for the colonel.

In the end, the US is saved by what amounts to almost random chance. That ended up being rather unsatisfying to me.

At one point the president and the general are talking in the white house and the president demands he resign. At this point I am thinking - you are the president - just fire the guy and announce it and the whole thing is over.",1382659200,,2152,4.254901960784314

883916,4,6304457391,"It flirts with the doomsday thriller, and certainly it explores topical end-of-the-world repercussions. But SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is more a political conspiracy thriller. It features two central figures, one of them our point-of-view character. USMC Colonel ""Jiggs"" Casey (Kirk Douglas) happens to be personal aide to 4-star General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), the very opinionated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Scott, a right wing extremist, cuts a polarizing figure. SEVEN DAYS IN MAY posits a highly charged political climate in which the Presidency is at its most unpopular.

Poor embattled President Lyman (Fredric March) is this perceived weakling who's advocating a disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union, a proposed course of action that infuriates huge chunks of the American masses. Protesters demand the President's head and they rally around General Scott. Scott is vociferously against the cessation of the nuclear race. Might makes right. ""Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition,"" said some patriot. The general believes he has the people's backing. We see what happens when Col. Jiggs Casey, left in the dark, begins to suspect Scott and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff of planning to overthrow the government.

I think everything good has already been said about this film, so I'm just here to echo everyone else's heaps of praise. Razor-edged suspense with consummate execution with thought-provoking themes.

Burt Lancaster submits a chilling performance as the ""patriotic"" military zealot, and he's got his buddy, Kirk Douglas, to thank for it. Douglas had wanted him on board this film project and so ceded the juicier role to Burt as an incentive. It's an all-around highly professional cast of actors, with folks like Martin Balsam, Ava Gardner, and Edmond O'Brien making a memorable impression in supporting roles. Rod Serling wrote the screenplay, and really all it required was one cautionary left turn of a twist for this movie to pass as an episode of Twilight Zone. Luckily, Jiggs Casey has got his thinking cap on, sniffing out a shady horceracing betting pool and, from that, unearthing an unthinkable coup d'etat.",1378425600,,2505,5.767567567567568

884067,5,6304457391,"John Frankenheimer recalled, ""Paranoia only exists if the circumstances are totally untrue."" As for The Manchurian Candidate, he said history has ""vividly demonstrated that there are lots and lots of plots to assassinate presidents and high-ranking figures for political gain...There's a certain grotesque reality about The Manchurian Candidate. And as far as Seven Days in May is concerned, we know that there was a very definite group in the military that would have, at one point, liked to have taken over the government...The extreme right has been very, very effective in undermining quite a few things that could've changed the destiny of this country."" (Brothers, David Talbot)

One summer weekend in 1962 while out sailing with friends, President Kennedy was asked what he thought of Seven Days in May, a best-selling novel that described a military takeover in the United States. JFK said he would read the book. He did so that night. The next day Kennedy discussed with his friends the possibility of their seeing such a coup in the United States. He told Paul Fay, ""It's possible. It could happen in this country, but the conditions would have to be just right. If, for example, the country had a young President, and he had a Bay of Pigs, there would be a certain uneasiness. Maybe the military would do a little criticizing behind his back, but this would be written off as the usual military dissatisfaction with civilian control. Then if there were another Bay of Pigs, the reaction of the country would be, 'Is he too young and inexperienced? ' The military would almost feel that it was their patriotic obligation to stand ready to preserve the integrity of the nation, and only God knows just what segment of democracy they would be defending if they overthrew the elected establishment. Then, if there were a third Bay of Pigs, it could happen. But it won't happen on my watch.""

Ted Sorensen recalled that JFK joked darkly about how ""I know a couple [of Joint Chiefs] who wish they could"" overthrow him. (Kennedy p684). Arthur Schlesinger related how Kennedy saw the book as ""a warning to the republic."" (RFK and his Times p485) John Frankenheimer recalled, ""President Kennedy wanted Seven Days in May made. Pierre Salinger conveyed this to us. The Pentagon didn't want it done. Kennedy said that when we wanted to shoot at the White House he would conveniently go to Hyannis Port that weekend.""

Scott is plotting something nefarious (sorry; won't spoil it by telling you what; just think early 1960s technology), he goes to the president with what he knows.

What follows is a scramble to foil the plot, with President Lyman unsure of whom he can trust. It's a complex story, and an exciting one, but without the blood and bombs generally associated with military stories in the 21st century.

884118,4,6304457391,"When I recently viewed this film, I began with assumptions regarding the period it was made which was the height of the Cold War.  Having seen ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with its obvious take on the McCarthy period, and other films like ""Failsafe"" with's its playing on the fear of nuclear war, I thought this film would also have direct allusions to the political and social culture of the time. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was not the case.
The first difference was the way General James Mattoon Scott was portrayed by Rod Serling in the script and powerfully played by Burt Lancaster.  In the Cold War period, the public's views of Generals was heavily influenced by swaggering, egotistical models like General George S Patton and General Douglas MacArthur. Considering that MacArthur was insubordinate and later sacked by President Truman, I thought he might be a model for General Scott, but that was most definitely not the case.  Burt Lancaster's cool, understated performance, even when he is in his final confrontation with the President shows a type of man who would NOT be considered  by outside observers as a threat to democracy the way Patton and MacArthur were by at least some people (Note how William Manchester's biography of MacArthur is entitled ""American Caesar"").  General Scott is not a rabble rouser and does not come across as a demagogue nor as a warmonger, as some Generals of the period were viewed, for example Air Force General Curtis Lemay. His opposition to the President's disarmament treaty is reasonable and he does not appear to be a Napoleon-type potential dictator, but as a patriotic, concerned public servant.  In the public speech he gives he does not denounce democracy and doesn't imply that maybe a different regime is desirable.
Having taken all this into consideration, I think Rod Serling was trying to say that a true threat to democracy can come not only from shrieking demagogues, but from people who seem reasonable and who might sweeten the temptation by saying the coup ""is only for a limited time"" or some such thing.
The second surprise was the way the President was portrayed. By the 1960's the US had seen decades of colorful and charismatic Presidents.  FDR was viewed as a father figure by millions of Americans, Truman, after a hestitant start was seen as a very earthy, interesting figure, Ike was a war hero and JFK was worshipped by many people. In this film, President Jordan Lyman is colorless, unimpressive, tired old man. In spite of this, the President marshals up all his intelligence and inner strength to take on a popular General when he himself is very unpopular.  I feel that Rod Serling here is trying to point out that true leadership can come from people who don't at first glance really seem to have the qualities necessary.
Another interesting aspect of the film is that it leaves a lot of loose ends....for example do the treasonous Generals get away with their crimes?  What is the public reaction to this seeming purge of the military high command for what seems to be a matter of nothing more than a political vendetta by the President? (Truman got away with his sacking of MacArthur who was not able to leverage his popularity into political power).  How do the Soviets react to this seeming lashing out by a weak President in what seems a desperation move?
Finally, I think there is an encouraging sub-message from the film, and that is that it seems unlikely that any such sort of thing could really happen.  We that that no only Col. Jiggs Casey is alarmed by the hints of things he was seeing, but also the Air Force General in charge of air transport contacts the President when he sees a lot of his aircraft vanishing from his control.  It appears that in real life, such a plot could not be kept secret and enough people within the military would oppose it to prevent it from ever being carried out.",1313020800,2,3906,4.770370370370371

Directed by John Frankenheimer

Adapted by Rod Serling from the best-selling novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles Waldo Bailey II, Seven Days in May was allegedly inspired by the far-right ramblings of one General Edwin Walker. Burt Lancaster plays General James M. Scott, who, convinced that liberal President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) is soft on America's enemies, plots a military takeover of the United States. Every effort made by President Lyman to find concrete evidence of General Scott's scheme is scuttled by political protocol, human error and accidental death. Ultimately, Lyman must rely upon the man who first uncovered the plot: Scott's best friend, Colonel ""Jiggs"" Casey (Kirk Douglas). John Frankenheimer's terse direction and Ellsworth Fredericks' stark black and white photography add considerably to the this absolute ripper of a film.

Oscar Nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Edmond O'Brien)
Oscar Nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Cary Odell & Edward G. Boyle)

Special footnote: -- Kirk Douglas had originally signed to play Gen. James Mattoon Scott. Douglas eventually realized that his friend Burt Lancaster would be ideal as Scott, and took the less flashy role of Col. Martin ""Jiggs"" Casey after Lancaster signed on to the film. Fifth of seven films that Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster made together.

884183,4,6304457391,"I viewed this film recently and enjoyed it largely because of some good acting, a plot that I found suspenseful and because it doesn't rely on car chases and blowing everything up.  However, I also felt dissatisfied and couldn't put my finger on why until I read the 1-star and 2-star reviews posted here. The script largely presents a good guy / bad guy drama.  (There is a brief flirtation with ambiguity when it is not clear what will hapen to the gerneal's letters, but the resolution of that tension just reinforces the good guy / bad guy structure.)

In my opinion, the film would have been simultaneously more realistic, more satisfying and more disturbing if both the Prez and the General had been given some more subtle ethical shading. As the 1-star review points out, thre was some moral ambiguities in America's global actions at this time that the film entirely ignores (not surprising given the time and the film maker) but that could add to the texture if this film were ever remade.

Burt Lancaster remains entirely on the surface of what could have been a very complex character.  Frederic March was a lot more interesting in his presidential musings but the press corps' rsponse to his oratorical flight in the final scene would be unthinkable in toda's polarized political atmosphere and is almost laughably  unrealistic even for the early 1960s when greater civiliity prevailed.

A note on Ava Gardner's casting and performance: I thought Ava Gardner was playing her characer the way it wa written and did a good job of it.  Some reviewers say she was flat as a femme fatale; I don't see her character as a femme fatale, rather as woman who is being cast aside by life and trying to deal with that fact  The one bit of really interesting ambiguity in the film is whether the Kirk Douglas figure really cares about her or is using her, or both.  If you haven't seen the film a lot of the above may seem unintelligble but I am trying ot avoid out-and-out spoilers.",1288742400,3,1982,4.653295128939828

The debate here, so wonderfully summarized in the final meeting between President Lyman and General Scott, asks if a constitution can be violated in order to ""protect"" it, an apparent oxymoron. It is the same debate we've seen about rendition and torture -- can you violate principles to maintain those principles?

This is a disappointing film of a 60's era political thriller about the Joint Chief of Staff Chairman's attempt to stage a political coup after a liberal  US president has rapprochement with the soviets. The film is famously the one in which John Frankenheimer and Burt Lancaster made up with each other, and in which John Frankenheimer and Kirk Douglas fell out with each other. (Who knew that men could act like squabbling female friends?).

The problem with the film is the actionless, suspenseless script by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame. In fact the film is episodic in its presentation, much like a 60's television show. Serling doesn't follow through on the thriller aspects of some scenes which cry out for it such as a southern senator's (Edmund O' Brien in a Laughtonesque protrayal of a bombastic, alcoholic legislator) escape from a secret military base in Texas, which is to be used by the  conspirators once the coup is accomplished. In addition to a boring, suspenseless script, the acting is not good  in some aspects. Burt Lancaster who can be wonderful at scene chewing when it is  called for (""The Rainmaker,"" ""Elmer Gantry"") is also a scene chewer when subtlety and control are called for. Here Lancaster's performance has no nuance. His traitorous general is just a flat out, unsympathetic bad guy, even though the character has a some good points about soviet dishonesty and perfidy. Since he has a key role in the  film, this  hurts the production. Ava Gardner, who looks old and bloated here,  is miscast as the femme fatale with whom Lancaster has had an extramarital relationship. When Kirk Douglas romances her in order to get some dirt on his boss Lancaster, he looks like he is kissing his mother. Not cool.

The standout performance is by Kirk Douglas, a pentagon colonel who stumbles onto the plot and coldly executes his duty as an American to foil  it. He manages to convey the fact that, as a military man, he loathes ratting out his boss because his duty as a citizen is more important than the chain of command. Frederic March is good as the liberal president who is concerned that the US and the soviets are going to blow each other  to smithereens if the Cold War is not  deescalated. Edmund O'Brien has some nifty moments as a southern senator who can rattle off dialogue as fast as Edward G Robinson. The ending reminded me of ""Dr. Strangelove,"" without its impact. In fact when the film ended, my husband and I just laughed at its ineffectiveness. A very disappointing film which purports to be a great one.",1286323200,6,2570,4.750561797752809

As usual in Hollywood, there are similar gaffs - the right side collar insignia on Kirk Douglas's shirt in upside-down. In the military, hats are never worn indoors (unless the individual is on duty and carrying a sidearm or rifle, e.g. Military Police.) Navy and Coast Guard personnel wear hats while aboard a vessel. These were Air Force, Marine Corps, and Army Officers and they wore their hats indoors - even in the White House - major military etiquette faux pas and reflected poorly on the authenticity of the movie, in that respect it was just like when General Scott (Lancaster) was caught by Douglas in an un-necessary lie.

In the United States, the military is controlled by the civilian government - all of the cabinet Secretaries are civilians and appointed by the President. The military budget is tightly controlled so that secret base couldn't have been created. Only the CIA budget is above scrutiny - there are funds for some special purposes for which accountability is not required - and there is no reason to think that the CIA is about to change the status-quo. The American people don't need to fear the military as there will never be a military coup in the United States.

It just shows that Hollywood can sometimes very much be a loose cannon on a rolling deck. Attention to detail is important in all phases of creative endeavors - and motion pictures are a modern art-form.

If you like films along those lines, you will like this one.

First, review of the content: This is a chilling tale of one variation on a way we could have found to destroy ourselves during the cold war. I won't say any more, no spoilers here. The acting is top notch. Both Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster play their roles with just the right amount of emotion. As my fellow reviewer noted in a review also strangely enough written today, a number of familiar character actors have great roles as well. I particularly like Martin Balsam. The ""futuristic"" set design is a bit dated but intriguing and quaint. The direction is interesting especially after listening to the director's commentary track. I rarely watch commentary tracks all the way through but I did for this one. It was interesting hearing about his preferred setups and back-stage secrets. Who would have guessed that the long-appearing hall at the pentagon was a forced-perspective set and that they hired little people (he uses another term) to walk at the far end. I know I am reviewing this on April Fools Day but I kid you not. I felt the direction seemed more television-like than for most movies but that also imparted a bit more tension to it in some ways. Rod Serling's script is sensational and there are a number of classic Serling monologues.

Second, review of the presentation: This is why I'm giving this one ""just"" 4 stars. The print this is made from can't possibly be the best they could find, but even if it is they should have at least taken the time to clean it before putting in through. This transfer has quite a bit of dirt and hair visible along with less easily correctable issues like occasional film tears and scattered spots where the picture warps for a second, likely from this print getting heated in a stuck projector and not quite burning. Despite these quibbles this is a very watchable film and is well worth buying or renting. I doubt that a better DVD will be produced in the future given the relatively limited appeal of this type of picture - one has to actually watch closely and think about it to enjoy it.",1270080000,4,2570,5.235436893203883
884232,5,6304457391,"This movie is based on the eponomous novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W Bailey which is a terrifc read too (maybe better than the movie).  With the screen play written by Rod Serling it has just the right amount of suspense though it does not follow the novel exactly.  A Marine colonel, played by Kirk Douglas, accidentally happens upon a plot to overthrow the US government by the top military leadership (lead by Burt Lancaster) who are upset with the President (played by Frederick March) because he plans to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union that will eliminate both countries nuclear weapons arsenals.  Full plot details can be read on Wikipedia.

A super cast with Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Frederick March and Ava Gardner leading the way and each adding just the right amount of character and emotion to their roles.  For movie buffs (or older telvison watchers), long time character actors like Andrew Duggan, Martin Balsam, Edmond O'Brien and Richard Anderson all make appearances.  The film is in black and white which I think added a bit to the tension even though it was made in 1964 when color was available.

If you are looking for a great drama with fine actors and a good story line I don't think you can go wrong with this movie. I won't spoil the ending, but recommend you purchase the movie and add it to your collection or rent it some weekend.  I have it in my collection and have enjoyed watching it and sharing it with friends. I hope that you will too.",1270080000,2,1482,4.608365019011407

Each scene tells a story and each word of dialog is spoken for a reason. The fact that his film is shot in black and white only enhances its impact.,1269129600,,437,4.475
884234,4,6304457391,"Simply put, Lancaster's and Douglas's acting are enough to give this movie excellent ratings. The story line of course is very relevant to today's events where a pacifist President is in the office and the military is more hawkish. So, it is one of those few movies that will never age and will never get old or irrelevant. Basic story line is wonderfully directed and presented. I wish they had developed more on the Marine Colonel (Douglas) relationship with Ava (the woman in the scandalous relation with Gen. Scott). That'd have been better. And the abrupt ending was not what I expected. Sort of unrealistic and leaves the viewer in limbo. All in all, this movie is worth it. 4/5",1266624000,3,684,4.708333333333333
884235,4,6304457391,"If ever there was a time to view this movie it is now, in todays poisoned political climate of distrust and near civil disobedience, re: Tea Party movement.
  The plot is simple.  A once popular USA President is now on a path that is both protested by the general public to the point of mass protests, and reviled by a cadre of his top military leaders in the Pentagon.  They decide to attempt a coup d'etat.
  Not only is this another top notch and suspenseful directing effort by John Frankenheimer, who stunned with ""The Manchurian Candidate"" two years previous, but it is another tour de force performance by the vastly underrated Burt Lancaster, in the starring role, which propels this beyond ordinary melodrama.
  Written by Rod Serling, yes that Rod Serling, (Twilight Zone, Requiem for a Heavyweight), and released in the year that the Viet Nam war was really beginning to ramp up, 1964, forty five years later it is still a relevant cautionary tale of political intrigue.
  Lancaster, as an immensely popular general with Presidential aspirations, is at odds with his President (Frederick March somewhat channeling his William Jennings Bryant characterization from ""Inherit the Wind""), over a disarmament treaty, and is planning, with other top military staff, to depose him.  Kirk Douglas turns in another competent journeyman effort as his top aide who stumbles across the conspiracy and agonizes over the rapidly unraveling realization that his trusted boss is the leader of this plot.
  While the plot begins to unfold, Edmond O'Brien, as the crusty Senator, and Martin Balsam, as a trusted Presidential aide, add character to the story. Only Ava Gardner seems wasted as a necessary plot device needed only to propel the story forward when needed, and then forgotten.
  Generally speaking the acting is top notch, the pace brisk and never boring, even at almost 2 hours, and the dialogue crisp and terse.  My problem with the movie is that even though it has an underlying tension, caused mostly by the interplay between characters, the conclusion is foregone and inevitable.  It seemed forced and anticlimatic.  But the final, brief confrontation between the General and his once trusted aide about the nature of betrayal, more than made up for the flacid ending.
  I give it 4 out of 5 stars as an entertaining and thought provoking diversion, something that seems to be missing in most of todays overindulget theatrical releases. Do you hear that Oliver Stone?",1264809600,3,2477,5.0245098039215685

884305,5,6304457391,"There is much to like about ""Seven Days in May"" as others have noted.  In this comment I focus on one long scene:  the confrontation between President Jordan Lyman and General James Mattoon Scott.

It is a compelling dialogue about democracy.  The general is full of himself, and realized effortlessly as only Burt Lancaster could do, an under-rated actor by all but Luchino Visconti.  The beleaguered president, played with enormous conviction and depth by Frederich March, still has one thing the general does not have, an electoral mandate.

While the film seems far fetched, a coup d'tat in the United States, as others have noted, the underlying tension is real.  There are times when the elected government may well have lost the confidence of the electorate, but it clings on because the constitution permits or indeed requires it to do so.  The election occurred in the past, by definition, and events may have wrought great changes, or the government, in this case embodied in one man, the president, may have changed course for one reason or another.  That electoral mandate is then a thing of the past, or so it may seem.

There are many examples, an Australian prime minster was removed from office in mid-term as recently as 1975, Israeli governments have stumbled as changing coalitions have produced policies from pure air, the threat of coup d'tat against Charles DeGaulle over Algerian independence was very real.  More mundane examples likewise abound.

An elected government confronts the reality of the responsibility of office and has to change its rhetoric form the carefree days of opposition to the hard edges of government.  Its supporters feel betrayed and the opposition beats the drum for a change of government.  In such a situation why wait for constitutional niceties?  Throw the rascals out, now!  Indeed, why not?  Because in the longer run this kind of mob rule and demagoguery destroys order, stability, and continuity.  The voice of the mob is not the voice of the people.  Why not?  Read on to find out why not.

What is the worth of that dated mandate?  President Lyman then makes an argument that the process that produced the mandate stands above all else, and it guarantees the continued worth of the mandate, dated or not.  Process?  The democratic election that yield President Lyman, that process.

General Scott claims to represent the will of the people, and just maybe he does in the film.  That is the tension.  He may be as much right as wrong.  He may be right about the will of the people.  But he certainly wrong about the voice of the people.

The voice of the people is not heard on talk-back radio, in studio audiences of public affairs television, newspaper letter pages, bars, and lobbies.  The voice of the people is heard in the ballot box.  That is Lyman's argument.

If he has exceeded his mandate, if the will of the people has truly changed as Scott believes, then the voice of the people will be heard at the next scheduled election.  To make that happen all Scott needs to do is declare his candidacy and run for election.  He can do that at any time.

Scott argues that time does not permit the luxury of democracy.  The threat is real, material, and immediate.  He might be right.  Yes, also, this is ever the usurpers argument.  It convinced Brutus to strike at Caesar.  It led many well meaning people to support Adolf Hitler.  Even if right, Scott is also wrong in a much more important way than he is right.

That is the great constraint of democracy.  It fixes the occasions of election in one way or another in any political system.  The rhythm of elections may not match the rhythm of events.  But to breach democracy in accord with the rhythm of events may be a greater destruction that any that events can wreak.  That is Lyman's reply.

After all, if the Soviets see a military seizure of power in the United States that alone will be sufficient to cause them to attack right now.  The very thing to be avoided will be provoked by the effort to prevent it.  But that kind of second guessing is just that, speculative second guessing.

The note that Lyman strikes repeatedly is that democracy is the open and endless opportunity for anyone to take to the soapbox and rally the voice of the people, and that is the one thing General Scott has conspicuously failed to do. He speaks only to those who already agree with.  One of the hallmarks of democracy is that it requires those who seek office to meet those who do not yet agree with them.  Though there is a lot of nonesense in electoral campaigns that essential requirement remains.  To win any candidate has to get votes from that vast bulk of voters who are ideologues.

Rather than face the auditorium with it noisily but vigorous disorder, his meetings have been in closed offices, underground car parks, back rooms, and the like, all this to save democracy from ... itself.",1220572800,,4907,4.709411764705882

Nonetheless, for my money, this film actually works a bit better, partly because of the fascinating behind-the-scenes look it provides at the workings of the Joint Chiefs and the Oval Office, partly because of a superior cast, and partly because the plot here (to overthrow a sitting President) is more plausible and thus more alarming. The love interest involving Ava Gardner is a bit of a throwaway, which is a shame because it wastes a charismatic actress. The rest of the film, however, is gripping and tightly told, and works in much the same suspense mold as ""Candidate."" Perhaps the best solution is just to buy them both and treat yourself to a double-feature. You'll never trust your government again (not that many of us do now).",1134432000,,996,5.079268292682927

Douglas plays a Colonel at the Pentagon who finds evidence that his boss, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Burt Lancaster), is plotting to overthrow the government.  Concerned that the President's (Fredric March) new treaty with the Soviets has enervated the defense of the USA, Lancaster devised a scheme to kidnap the president during a military alert, and take over the nation's communication systems - primarily the major TV networks. Douglas goes to the president and convinces him to at least look into his suspicions.  You'd think the plot could be easily foiled at this point, but the president's few trusted friends each run into trouble trying to get the proof to stop Lancaster.  If you like movies about national consipiracies, like Twilight's Last Gleaming and The Pelican Brief, or just political thrillers like The Sum of All Fears, Seven Days in May is one of the earliest major examples, along with The Manchurian Candidate.

Meanwhile General Scott head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played by the authoritative, tough Burt Lancaster, is secretly coordinating a desert based military installation with a mission to overthrow the government.

The film is fascinating on many levels.  For example, I can imagine why Richard Nixon would think that recording all Oval Office conversations would be a good idea, if he had seen this film (which I imagine he had).

884416,5,6304457391,"One year after ""The Manchurian Candidate"", John Frankenheimer was back at it with ""Seven Days in May"", screenwritten by ""Twi-Light Zone"" creator Rod Serling. Serling's ""Zone's"" were a masterpiece of semi-liberal social conscience. Frankenheimer seized on another 1950s novel based on the real events of 1934, in which Republican industrialists recruited Marine hero Smedley Butler to orchestrate a coup d'etat against FDR. The novel and Frankenheimer's film fictionalize the event. It was, again, one of the best movies ever made, but completely liberal. Frankly, I have to ask why in 1963 the decision was made to examine a political conspiracy from 1934 when the worst political crime in U.S. history, the stealing of the 1960 election by Kennedy over Nixon, had occurred just three years prior. The answer to that question, my friend, is blowin' in the wind.
After JFK's assassination, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was pulled because it hit too close to home, but in June, 1968 RFK was staying at Frankenheimer's Malibu home the night of the California Primary. He was tired and wanted to stay there. The enthusiasm of his victory that night convinced him to make the long drive on a twisting, turning Pacific Coast Highway, up the Santa Monica Freeway to downtown Los Angeles, where Sirhan Sirhan was waiting for him with a gun at the Ambassador Hotel.
Kirk Douglas is the Butler character In ""Seven Days In May"", an upright Marine whose politics are explained early by a fellow officer who says to him, ""I though you'd be an ACLU lawyer by now, protecting the great unwashed."" Douglas describes this officer as the kind who would be better suited for an army that goosesteps. Good dialogue, though. Burt Lancaster is the right wing Air Force General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is modeled after Curtis LeMay, although the Lancaster swagger and charisma make him far more appealing. Frederick March is President Jordan Lyman, an ardent liberal who has just signed a peace treaty with the Soviets that presumably dismantles much of our nuclear arsenal. Lancaster does not trust the Soviet will honor their end of the bargain. Therefore he is convinced they will strike and America will be lost. A U.S. Senator is in on Lancaster's plot to take over the Presidency. They make him from California just to make sure he is affiliated with Dick Nixon. Nice touch. The public is solidly against the President, fueled by a right wing radio host in a prescient script device. In the end, the ""protector of the great unwashed,"" Douglas, foils the plot and March's speech to the D.C. press corps is met by a standing ovation. Oh, those evil militarists and Republicans.

Burt Lancaster is superb in the role of General James Matoon Scott, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, and chief conspirator of a plot to overthrow the United States government after a weak-kneed President, played wonderfully by Frederic March, signs a disarmament treaty with the Russians.
Helping foil the plot is General Scott's aide, Colonel Jiggs Casey, played by Kirk Douglas.  Intrigue, deception, and treachery are played out against a backdrop of Washington offices and political seats of power.  Edmund O'Brien, Martin Balsam, and Ava Gardner all add significant performances in the film.
I was also very impressed with the way the military was portrayed with regard to uniforms and behavior--especially Lancaster's character.  Very realistic indeed.  Rumor has it that Frankenheimer wanted to shoot some scenes in the actual Pentagon but was turned down (probably because of the heretical subject of the movie).

This was one of those times where I left the theater saying to myself, ""Now THAT'S how movies should be made!""  I feel Leonard Maltin's review is sufficient; I will only add that some of the rocket models (intermingled with scale models of real ones) used to decorate Gen. Scott (Burt Lancaster)'s office and the Senate hearing room looked like cheap props out of bad science fiction movies, but that was only a minor distraction for me.  Lancaster's character was quite frightening, Fredric March made a believable President of the United States, Edmond O'Brien turns in another great character performance (this time as a Senator from Georgia), and the title sequence (reportedly by Saul Bass) coupled with Jerry Goldsmith's score is quite dramatic.

884419,4,6304457391,"John Frankenheimer (who died not very long ago) left us with a terrific repertoire of films, yet I don't hear his name mentioned often in discussions about influential American directors.  ""Seven Days in May"" seems to be all but forgotten; at least, I don't know anyone who's seen it or even heard of it.  But it's a terrific political intrigue film, its impact lessened only somewhat by the release of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" two years earlier.
There's no mistaking the John Frankenheimer style: the sharp black and white cinematography, stark sets and lighting, claustrophobic compositions.  Faces are framed in extreme close-up to completely dominate the screen.  He uses deep focus effectively; two characters will be having a conversation in the foreground, but a third will be constantly in view in the background, as if to suggest that every whispered secret has the potential to be overheard.
This style is fabulously on display in ""Candidate"" and is reprised here in ""Seven Days in May.""  Frankenheimer makes great use in both films of TV screens: a character will be simultaneously in view of the film's camera and projected on a screen within the world of the film, giving the movie viewer different angles of the same scene both literally and figuratively; since media plays a role so frequently in his movies, Frankenheimer constantly draws our attention to its existence and the power it has to manipulate what we perceive to be the truth.
As for the performances, there is no improving on Fredric March's understated interpretation of an ailing president, stuck in the dilemma of acting in what he thinks is the country's best interests even though the country itself is rejecting his beliefs.  Burt Lancaster does his usual steely Burt Lancaster thing as the film's villain and Kirk Douglas meets him line for line as a subordinate who begins to doubt his boss's integrity.  Ava Gardner gives a somewhat weird performance as the film's lone female character; she walks through the film as if drugged, but it works.  And Edmond O'Brien won an Oscar nomination as a hot-tempered southern senator and friend to the president, somewhat curious since March's performance of all of them seems ripe for Academy consideration.
""Seven Days in May"" isn't as taut a film as ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" and it's more heavy handed in its political agenda (this severely dates the film), but it's still a rousing good time and comes highly recommended.

884420,5,6304457391,"For whatever reasons, I am intrigued by films and television programs which offer recreations of Presidential activities which are presumably authentic. The West Wing, for example, as well as The American President and this film. Produced by Kirk Douglas and directed by John Frankenheimer, Seven Days in May is based on a hypothetical and perhaps plausible idea: During the Cold War, a cabal of senior-level officers in the United States military services led by General Robert Mattoon Scott (Lancaster) secretly plan a coup by which to remove President Jordan Lyman (March) who is perceived to be ""soft"" on Communism, indeed naive as he stubbornly pursues policies which (the officers fear) would render their beloved nation impotent to foreign domination. Kept highly secret for obvious reasons, the coup preparations have been underway for quite some time as the film begins. Douglas plays Colonel Martin (""Jiggs"") Casey, a Marine officer who reports directly to General Scott. Casey views Scott (as do countless others) as a great American patriot. As portrayed by Lancaster, he is indeed impressive. At times intimidating. Scott's brilliant mind is wholly free of any second thoughts, either about himself or about the course on which he proceeds. He would vigorously deny the accusation that he and his coup associates are committing treason.

Inadvertently, Casey learns about the coup and at first refuses to believe it. Loyal to Scott and methodical by nature, he begins to gather the salient facts like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle (no pun intended), dreading the image which begins to emerge. At this point, it would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen the film to reveal  any more about the narrative. Suffice to say that Frankenheimer brilliantly increases the tension as President Jordan and his associates (who include a reluctant Colonel Casey) scramble to prevent the coup. The acting is consistently outstanding. The events preceding the inevitable climax are credible (including some unexpected luck which does not seem to me farfetched), and the film concludes with style and grace. It is worth noting that Rod Serling wrote the screenplay, based on a best-selling novel co-authored by Fletcher Knebel and Charles Waldo Bailey II. Also, that Ava Gardner skillfully plays a small but essential role as Eleanor Holbrook. This is not a thriller, much less a chiller. Rather, the film offers an especially interesting story, well-told. It has lost little (if any) of its dramatic impact during the almost 40 years since its initial release.

884423,5,6304457391,"Seven Days in May is a wonderful cold-war suspense drama that looks superb on DVD. It features excellent acting and a truly unique and riveting storyline. The story, written primarily by Rod Serling (he of the Twilight Zone), describes the events leading up to a near-military coup within the U.S. at the height of the cold war. Given that the U.S. represents the largest fully democratic system of government on Earth, a military coup would usually be unthinkable. However, Serling makes the possibility semi-plausible: an unpopular pacifistic president, the threat of nuclear war, and a rising military star who is revered by the joint chiefs.
The acting is amazing. Lancaster and Douglas are at their very best here. And Frederic March easily gives the best portrayal of any U.S. president in a movie. He shows exactly the right mix of emotions: you see his leadership skills, his diplomacy skills, and even his own weaknesses. Two amazing scenes stand out: the one between Douglas and March where the coup is revealed and the one between March and Lancaster near the end of the film. Martin Balsam and John Houseman are equally convincing -- the latter actor only appears for a short time onscreen, but milks the time for all its worth.
The DVD is worth purchasing for 2 reasons. The picture quality is great and the movie looks crisp in its original 1:85:1 ratio. The second reason is that you get to hear the excellent commentary of the late John Frankenheimer, who goes into extraordinary detail about the scenes. He even relates one story where his ex-wife noticed a set decoration in apartment owned by Ava Gardener's character that Frankenheimer stole from the house they shared together -- it's a total crack up.",1045008000,5,1723,4.904109589041096
884454,5,6304457391,"""Seven Days in May"" was a so-so book that John Frankenheimer turned into an absolutely brilliant movie.  It's an excellent cold-war drama, made at a time when tension between this country and the Soviet Union was at boiling point.  At the center of the story is President Jordan Lyman, a well-meaning, somewhat naive chief executive who has pushed through a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviets, which most of the country, and all of the military, fear the Soviets have no intention of honoring.  The stage is set for a political confrontation between the president's supporters, who feel they must back him whatever their private apprehensions, and his opponents, who fear he is selling the country out.  Enter at this point a career soldier with political ambitions, General James Scott, who plans to put his enormous popularity to work in devising a scheme that he thinks will save his country, which is nothing less than a military plot to overthrow the government.  However, loose lips can sink a ship, and a few chance words reach the ears of Colonel Jiggs Casey, a Marine torn between his loyalty to his general, General Scott, and his commander in chief, president Lyman.  What makes a good soldier, and what makes a true patriot?  That is the dilemma Casey has to come to grips with as he realizes that the clock is ticking, the plot is underway, and there are less than seven days left before something very big goes down.

The movie has minimal action and a lot of dialogue, but the tension is maintained nicely throughout, and the acting is uniformly excellent.  Among the excellent cast, the standouts are Frederic March as the president, Burt Lancaster as General Scott, Kirk Douglas in one of his finest roles as Colonel Casey, and Ava Gardner, still drop-dead gorgeous, as Scott's cast-off mistress, drowning herself in booze, self-pity and resentment.  The final verbal confrontation between Casey and Scott near the movie's end is one of the best I've ever witnessed on film.  The movie grabs hold of you from the opening frames and keeps you riveted right to the end, all the while making you wonder, could it really happen here?  Let's hope we never find out...

The movie keeps the momentum going without much in the way of extraneous material. Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas both turn in fine performances.  The supporting cast is of similar caliber.
The most frightening thing about the movie is that it manages to make a pretty good case that such a thing could actually happen.  Let's all hope the military has enough fine officers like Kirk Douglas in this film to prevent it from happening!

884456,4,6304457391,"SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is a film about the clear relationship that exists between the civilian, elected government of the United States and its military. In this country, the President usually consults with his military on matters of national security, and respects their collective opinion, but when it is time to decide, he has only his own conscience to listen to. All dispute, all disagreement between him and them is supposed to vanish. But what if elements of the military decided to ignore this bit of constitutional law to achieve their goals and circumvent his? That is the premise of SEVEN DAYS IN MAY. To those who believe in liberty and its preservation, such a thought is unsettling. Director John Frankenheimer portrays a contemporary American society not unlike many such past and present ones, one that is sharply split between what the public and the military want but that which the President opposes. General Scott, played with a steely, no nonsense air by Burt Lancaster, is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Scott is convinced that the President (Frederic March) is leading the country to ruin via a foolish disarmorment policy that in Scott's opinion will leave America helpless against the Soviets. He plans a military coup in which he will assume the Presidency, but word leaks out to one of his subordinates, Colonel Casey (Kirk Douglas) who spends much of the movie trying to decide what to do, and having decided that, to convince the President of the validity of the threat. Ultimately, the President, with the aid of some underhanded dealing by Colonel Casey, squashes the threat and forces the resignation of all the top officers involved in the coup.
SDM is a response to the cold war threat of the 50s and 60s that might come not from the barrels of the Russians but from the smoke filled rooms of traitors plotting against the red, white, and blue. As the viewer listens to the reasons given by General Scott as he realizes that his plot has been uncovered, the viewer can sense the hollowness of Scott's arguments. As the President responds that General Scott is free to change the status quo, there are constitutional means to do so. 'Run for office,' the President thunders, 'if you want to sit in my chair.' Scott can make no effective counter as he leaves the room to a forced retirement. This movie asks Americans to question just how far they should go in good conscience when they strongly disapprove of the actions of the elected civilian leaders. The answer is simple: Run for office and change things within the system. To do otherwise would leave a government with an American name but without American ideals.",1025395200,4,2659,4.820568927789934

I often thought this movie has a particular insight into the Kennedy assasination, but who can tell?

884459,5,6304457391,"John Frankenheimer followed up his 1962 cult classic THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE with SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, a very sobering but nevertheless gripping Cold War political thriller that remains interesting from start to finish.
The president (Frederic March) is about to sign a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union in order to ease tensions between the superpowers.  But the Soviets have had a history of renegging, and this prompts March's poll numbers to go through the floor.  It also opens the door for General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to plan a coup d'etat against March.
The only problem is, though, that a dedicated underling (Kirk Douglas) has gotten wind of the attempt.  At the moment, Douglas has no hard proof on him, only whisperings of a secret base or operation known as ECOMCON.  But it is enough to get March to consider the possibility, and he gets his closest friends, including a congenial but inebriated Georgia senator (Edmond O'Brien) to investigate.
When the proof is presented to March, he realizes that this coup is not just being caused by Lancaster's men, it is caused by the age in which we live--a nuclear age.  The superbly mounted confrontation between March and Lancaster in the Oval Office in which March reveals his hand is one of the great dramatic moments of 1960s cinema.
All the performances in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY are brilliant, and Frankenheimer's direction is appropriately suspenseful in the best Hitchcock tradition.  The Charles Bailey/Fletcher Knebel novel upon which this film is based was excellently adapted to the screen by Rod Serling; and while there is a moral tone to the film, it is never heavy-handed.  Jerry Goldsmith's fine score tops everything off.
Next to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, and FAIL SAFE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is an essential Cold War drama that, despite the fact that the Cold War acutally ended over a decade ago, has lost none of its punch.",995587200,8,1982,4.951807228915663
884460,5,6304457391,"There were a number of excellent political thrillers in the Sixties, and Seven Days in May is one of the best.  Fredric March stars as the President who is trying to push through a nuclear disarmament treaty, but he is meeting a lot of resistance.  Chief among them is General Burt Lancaster, who has decided to take over the government to continue building America's military.  Lancaster has developed an elaborate plan for his takeover, but his assistant, Kirk Douglas, has been left out.  When Douglas begins to suspect something, the tension starts to rise.  The plot sounds incredible, yet as written by the great Rod Serling and directed by John Frankenheimer, it is only too believable.  The performances are all top notch by the stars, while Ava Gardner as Lancaster's former mistress and Edmond O'Brien as an alcoholic senator supporting the treaty shine in supporting roles.  This is a smart movie that will take you back to a time not long ago when the Cold War had paralyzed the world.  This is the kind of intelligent, tense thriller I wish we could see more of these days.",986601600,64,1086,4.770053475935829
884461,5,6304457391,"Yes, with the right ingredients, it could.  All those military coups going on in other countries and all the unrest in the world, you can easily assert...yes, it could happen here.  The unthinkable dread of a military takeover.  SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is more than a great film.  It is a reminder for us to take a minute and be thankful that a takeover hasn't happened here and hope such an event won't take place.",984009600,2,409,4.413333333333333
884462,4,6304457391,"Though it's not quite as good as ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" this is still an outstanding movie. John Frankenheimer's adept direction and Rod Serling's literate, nuanced script complement the fine work of a brilliant cast. And unlike most of the nuclear war flicks of the '60s, ""Seven Days"" avoids the preachiness and propaganda that run through the bulk of the genre.

The DVD equals the film in quality. The print appears flawless, and the sound is as good as can be expected from a 60's era movie. Special features include a theatrical trailer, some brief production notes, and a detailed, informative commentary from Frankenheimer. He includes all kinds of fun details about the making of the movie. (Ex: rather than building gigantic sets to represent the infinite cooridors of the Pentagon, the crew built a V-shaped corridor, and hired midgets to walk back and forth across the corridor, creating the illusion of distance.) (Ex #2: the intensity of the performances might have something to do with the Cuban Missle Crisis taking place during filming.)

My only quibble is that Frankenheimer apparently had a cold when he taped the commentary, because he sounds congested. It's distracting at first, but otherwise it's a first-rate commentary.

One bit of trivia: Leonard Maltin notes this film marks John Houseman's screen debut, but there are two other sightings: Leonard Nimoy in an uncredited role, and I could be wrong, but I could swear I saw Robert Mitchum in a non-speaking cameo as a U.S. Senator.",970272000,4,1512,5.06425702811245
884463,5,6304457391,"I do not know what happened to John Frankenheimer.  He recently directed the less than stellar Reindeer Games and Island of Dr. Moreau.  But once  upon a time Frankenheimer was a top notch director putting out classics  such as The Train, Manchurian Candidate, and Seven Days in May.
Seven  Days in May is as topical now as it was years ago when it was made.  Burt  Lancaster is awesome as a popular MacArthur type General prepared to launch  a military coup against an unpopular elected President.  Kirk Douglas plays  his adjunct who works to stop the plot and protect the President.
As good  as the story is and as good as the other actors in the film are you must  check out how good Douglas and Lancaster are in their scenes together.  IT  is the equivalent of Pacino and Deniro in the coffee shop during Heat.  These two tear up the scenery.
Anyone interested in watching on of the  best political thrillers ever made needs to see this film.  It is an  awesome film.
This is a great DVD to own.",966211200,5,1000,4.430939226519337

What really bothers me about this is that, when the President finds out there is a military plot to take over the government, he sends out his trusted aids alone. One is killed, one is kidnapped.

If each aide was accompanied by a company of soldiers, none of this could have happened.",1525651200,,362,4.73015873015873

it is not necessary to kill or maim a lot of people to get a point across.",1521504000,,512,4.03960396039604
