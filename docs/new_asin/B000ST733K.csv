8206814,5,B000ST733K,This was a great DVD after completing the slim n 6 series. It was a great combo of the first three dvd's with a few new moves to keep it entertaining. I will continue to use keep it up on the days I don't make it to the gym.,1374624000,,224,3.5918367346938775
8206815,5,B000ST733K,"I LOVE the Slim in 6 series, I own quite a few. You get a really good workout, these aren't 30 minutes workouts. More like a hour
or more. I usually break them down 30 minutes of her/30 minutes of something else. Her dvds are so worth it!",1363996800,2,238,3.9791666666666665
8206816,5,B000ST733K,"Well...I don't know why you'd be kissing cellulite, but even so.  I finished the original ""Slim in 6"" program, which is difficult for the somewhat unmotivated, non-athletic types like myself.  It requires some effort and, although that makes me hate it to an extent, it definitely produces results.  Anyway, the ""Burn it up"" segment is the last in the original program and it's about an hour work-out that can get old after several weeks.  I read a few reviews for ""Keep it up"" and thought, ""Hey it's shorter which implies easier, that sounds great.""

That's not exactly the truth, although it IS shorter (about 40 minutes from start to finish).  It's a lot of the same moves from ""Burn it up"" with a few twists, and then extended arm and floor work segments.  The floor work is what got me - my legs and butt were sore again, which I didn't think was possible after all they went through during ""Burn it up.""  Bottom Line: If you liked the original Slim in 6, this is definitely the perfect follow-up.  And it's a tad easier to motivate yourself when you know you'll be done in 40 minutes instead of 60.

One side note though - there is no specific ab routine at the end.  You can either do ""Slim & 6-pack"" (which is included with the ""Keep it up"" dvd and runs about 12 minutes) or add your own preferred routine, but I'd suggest doing that at least a few times a week.  Especially if you have the post-pregnancy belly going on.  :]",1350950400,3,1433,4.423664122137405
8206817,2,B000ST733K,"First, let me say that I really like Debbie Siebers, she's easy to follow and has the right tone of voice for providing instruction. What I like about her workouts is that they're effective, what I don't like about her workouts is that they're very long and very repetitive. The only reason I'm rating this workout as low as I am is because if you have the original Slim in 6 workout, you basically already have this workout. She really only adds maybe four new moves to the workout and then doubles up the reps on the same exercises from the first video. Had I known that ahead of time, I would have skipped this video.

The workout time is shorter for this video, but only because she leaves out ab work. There is an ab workout on the dvd, but I wish it was included within this workout. Debbie also includes a really good stretch workout on dvd.

One last criticism is Debbie's counting for the exercises, she tends to workout one side more than the other. Maybe I'm nitpicking, but I hate having to keep track of the count from the left to the right side. If you're paying for a workout video, you shouldn't have to concern yourself with keeping count.

On the plus side, you can turn the music off for the workout. I use my own music to keep me motivated.

Overall a good workout, but not much different from the original Slim in 6 workout.",1348358400,,1345,4.346613545816733
8206818,3,B000ST733K,"This is quite a good workout series, although it is one of the older ones out there. I like the style and the way she teaches each movement.",1331078400,,140,4.035714285714286
8206819,5,B000ST733K,I like this as a follow-up to the slim in 6 program.  The Burn It Up DVD was getting boring (after 4 full weeks) and this is a great change.  Results with this program have been amazing.,1258848000,8,186,4.0
8206820,5,B000ST733K,"I've been using various Beachbody workouts for a little less than a year. In spite of the typical infomercial ad campaigns the programs I've done from them are very effective and straight forward.

I have been exercising for the better part of the last 20 years, and haven't missed a day of some form of exercise in the past 11 years. Lots of years of Yoga, Pilates and Strength training!

Anyway, my wife had actually purchased Debbie's ""Slim In 6"" program at the same time I got Tony Horton's P90X. After finishing P90X I figured that for ""fun"" I'd do some of Debbie's programs, thinking they'd be a piece of cake. WRONG! They were actually very tough and humbling!

Slim in 6 works your body quite differently because of the constant low impact cardio type moves that really target your lower body before moving on to the resistance band and floor work exercises.

Keep It Up is under 45 minutes and starts with her standard standing warm ups which move into lots of squat, plie and other moves as well as standing ab work. Also she includes a small bit of kickboxing type exercises.

Then you move onto the resistance band work. She does two sets of a sequence of rows, shoulder presses, curls, and triceps extensions. Believe me, it seems like it's going to be easy but by the time you're thru you'll be pretty fatigued in those muscles.

After comes floor work. you're on all fours and doing various types of leg raises. It's so intense I actually have to alternate legs every few reps, sometimes every rep, because my glutes were burning so badly.

In between the right and left side of floor work you do a long set of pushups (wide), after the second set of floor work you do tricep pushups (elbows in close).

The program ends with some standing stretches and then you're done.

The program also comes with optional ab work (Slim in 6 pack) and stretching (Slim in limber) on the same DVD if you want to add those.

All in all, I've been thoroughly impressed with Slim in 6, Keep It Up and the Slim Series programs I've tried.

If you see my more than 200 reviews here on amazon, you'll see that I'm clearly not affiliated in any way w/ Beachbody (mostly Yoga/Pilates dvd/vhs and book reviews) but I have really benefitted, as has my wife, from these excellent programs.

One word of advice, if you do buy from Beachbody pay in full, not in separate payments as I've heard of people having difficulties with getting extra charges. I've always done it in one payment and so far (knock on wood) have had zero problems.

Of course you could just buy it from Amazon market place or Ebay and not have to worry about it, but I've been really pleased so far w/ my dealings with Beachbody so far though I know there are many folks who have had issues with them.",1195603200,27,2762,4.47808764940239
