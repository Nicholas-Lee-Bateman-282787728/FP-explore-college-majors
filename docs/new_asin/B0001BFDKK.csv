1986220,1,B0001BFDKK,"Perhaps it would have atleast been a balanced interview if Josh McDowell,Lee Strobel,William Lane Craig or Ravi Zacharias had been able to comment instead of it being biased and one sided from the rather apparent self proclaimed scholar, John Dominic Crossan. As well as four of the seven 'scholars' who belong to the Jesus Seminar!
(According to Marcus J. Borg, a participating scholar in the Jesus Seminar and author of Jesus in Contemporary Scholarship, Trinity Press International  1994, page 160)
**After analysis and discussion of a saying attributed to Jesus, members of the seminar voted on whether they thought the saying goes back to Jesus himself by casting one of four differently colored beads into a ballot box.
A red vote means, ""I think these are the authentic words of Jesus""; pink means, ""A close approximation of what Jesus said""; gray means, ""Not Jesus' words, though they may reflect his ideas""; and black means, ""Inauthentic; definitely not spoken by Jesus.""
 So basically, if you prefer to weigh your faith on the out come of colored beads, then this is for you. Other wise don't waste time and money.",1126310400,13,1124,4.973404255319149
1986221,5,B0001BFDKK,"I wanted to give this video five stars for one, in order to thwart the religious zealouts who feel by their one-star ratings there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to this report and who hope to discourage others from buying it, and two, to pay tribute to the late Peter Jennings and honor what will now be seen as part of his enduring legacy. He had the curiosity of a child and the doggedness of a pitbull, and I could trust that he pandered to nobody in the search for truth. I watched this show when it was on the air with my aunt who herself died only a month ago; we both learned from it, and I will add this DVD to my collection in memory of both of them.",1123632000,18,667,4.099236641221374
1986222,5,B0001BFDKK,"M.Read's review said, among other things, ""Actually, the MANY books of the Bible were not written during the time of Jesus. They were written, and re-written 100 to 400 years after his life on earth.""

He goes on to scorn those of us ""who only believe what they have been taught in a building on Sunday morning.""

Unfortunately, every assertion he makes is _INCORRECT_. Every single archaeological find containing books of the Bible, from the Dead Sea scrolls to the Nag Hammadi scrolls to 1st-2nd century copies of the Bible, shows that its content has been remarkably -- one might even say supernaturally -- free from transcription errors.  Mr. Read is not telling us facts, but only what he chooses to believe, based on essentially zero data.

Maybe he would have done better to walk into that building, and listen.",1114646400,11,818,4.821428571428571
1986223,4,B0001BFDKK,"Actually, the MANY books of the Bible were not written during the time of Jesus. They were written, and re-written 100 to 400 years after his life on earth. Also, many of the books were edited, left out and re-written by Constantine and others to adhere to their own personal beliefs.

This documentary is absolutely wonderful at showing Jesus as he was as a man. Instead of the stories told in churches and expanded on over time. The only person who would object to this, are people who only believe what they have been taught in a building on Sunday morning. Open your mind and use your own intellect to make your own judgement. A WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY.",1109462400,16,655,4.598290598290598
1986224,1,B0001BFDKK,"It is fascinating how every generation seems to think they know more about history than those who lived it.  When people disbelieve the record of an historic event by those who were there when it happened, and proceed to build a history based on modern opinion, they do err.  And to add insult to injury, these moderns love to present their edited versions of history as ""historic"" and scholarly.

The record of Jesus of Nazareth is found in the New Testament, written for the most part by those who were there with Him.  Those who do not like that record (hate the truth?) would be far more respectable if they would simply and honestly admit that they do not believe, instead of inventing endless non-historic versions.

Honest seekers of the historic Jesus would do well to start with the New Testament of the Bible and then read the writings of scholars who remain true to the record.

Nice try, Mr. Jennings, but your search seems to have led you and will lead many others astray from the truth.",1105056000,15,1000,4.589887640449438
1986225,4,B0001BFDKK,"I saw this when it was shown on television. I was enthralled by the fact that it presented the factual history of the life of Jesus the Christ.

 I recently purchased it through Amazon.com and viewed it immediately upon recieving the package.

 I would like to inform the reader that I am a devout Christian of the Catholic religion who is not afraid to listen to, or read about, nor even see films that contain historical, archaelogical data to support their viewpoints on the life of the one now known to us as Jesus the Christ. All the other previous reviewers cannot deny the facts. All they can do is beg the Bible when it comes to espousing their viewpoints on Christianity. They'll even tell us that we are blasphemers and will rot in hell for not believing in what they believe. But most of them are not even faintly familiar with the actual history of the Bible. Well, I feel sorry for them. Hey, it's the Christian thing to do, is it not?

 Anyway, job well done in presenting the FACTS, Mr. Jennings. I await the release on DVD of the episode you recently did on the historical life of Mary, the mother of Jesus the Christ.",1091059200,34,1134,4.427884615384615

1986227,1,B0001BFDKK,If you are someone who doesn't believe any of the Bible (i.e. like the Jesus Seminar) then you'll love this video.

1986228,1,B0001BFDKK,"It was almost humorous to listen to Peter Jennings try to report this as being balanced. Unsupported assertions are abound in this piece.
 Only liberal scholars were interviewed except NT Wright who would have challenged the many unfounded, assertions if permitted. Read his books you'll understand.
 At least give some evidence if you're going to say something like: ""Mary was not a virgin. Jesus was probably the illegitimate child of a Roman soldier. Jennings said, ""Perhaps a Roman soldier made Mary pregnant--Mary could well have been a teenager, raising a child by herself--Here are the only things we can say with some certainty about the birth of Jesus: He was born Jewish at a time of great political tension.""

or : ""Jesus didn't perform the miracles in which He commanded nature...walking on the water, turning water into wine, and feeding five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fish. Peter Jennings said, ""Most scholars we talked to think these stories were invented by the Gospel writers as advertisements for Christianity in its early years. Christianity, after all, was competing for followers with Judaism and with Greek and Roman pagan religions.""

 These are but a few of the many unsupported assertions and theories given by Jennings and the liberal scholars.
 You have to give evidence to support your line of reasoning for your truth claims to be somewhat credible.
 Instead, all we have are personal opinions based on...you guessed it, personal opinion and guesswork.
 Do a search for: Response to The Search for Jesus and you'll find many articles explaining what a biased agenda driven piece this really is.
 If you want a balanced, historical show on Jesus look elsewhere. Jennings, not surprisingly, is hardly objective.",1081468800,14,1762,5.111498257839721
1986229,5,B0001BFDKK,"This is a well researched and balanced look into the historical Jesus.  Peter Jennings is an excellent host, and one of my favorite news people of all time.  He states from the beginning that he can not say whether Jesus was literally the Son of God.  That question can only be answered by faith.  I'd say that's pretty fair and doesn't take anything away from anyone's religious views.

I watch this DVD every year during Lent, and any other time of the year I want a little pick-me-up for my soul.  It is amazingly relevant and thought provoking.  And the images of the Holy Land are just great!",1299110400,4,597,4.472222222222222
1986230,1,B0001BFDKK,"The purse string holders at ABC news paid for the hotels, camera crews, and travel expenses to make this series, but no one was at the wheel, truth-wise. If I had to guess, I would say the mission statement of ABC news was the same as that of Time and Newsweek, when every year at Easter or Christimas they quote the same buffoonish scholar-skeptics to ""prove"" that Jesus was not who he said he was. As if pretty pictures, ""quote marks,"" and ""academic credentials"" will somehow morph into truth greater than God's message. I'm not blaming Peter Jennings. He did go as far as most journalists go in asking dogged questions. The trouble is, the information is only as accurate as the sources, and they are not, in this series, telling the viewers the facts. Matthew, Mark, and John WERE eyewitnesses, and the gospels were not written way later by some weirdos. Luke was a Roman physician who did do careful journalistic research after Jesus' crucifixion, and he interviewed many who saw Jesus after come back to life after three days. There were 500 witnesses at least. There is much evidence, as others have pointed out, so I would only recommend this series as a travelogue to the modern Holy Land. Get some real sources if you actually want truth. A point-by-point refutation of the inaccuracies in the Search for Jesus would be a good thing, yet I doubt it would convince the people who actually believe the ABC news version, anyway.
(There are at least a dozen printed point-by-point refutations of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code by actual scholars (some of whom used to be skeptics), but they keep migrating to the back shelves, while lots of friends of mine still prefer to believe a novelist rather than people who've done the research.)",1290211200,7,1741,4.730263157894737
1986231,1,B0001BFDKK,"Unfortunately, Peter Jennings who I really still like, was duped by so called ""Bible scholars"" called the ""Jesus Seminar"". Sounds good, but underneath it all, this video promoted their biased belief that the historical Jesus and the Biblical Jesus were different. Rather than being duped as Mr. Jennings was by both titles, prestige, and the rather seemingly innocent sounding name of this group--""Jesus Seminar"" your money would be better spent in the name of ""a journalistic investigation"" by viewing the DVD, ""A Case For Christ"" by Lee Strobel who himself was a Chicago Tribune reporter and self-proclaimed atheist.

1986235,4,B0001BFDKK,"As the film reveals most Christians know little about Paul. Probably non-Christians know less. Yet this is the man who took a minority declining cult and turned it into a world religion without ever intending it. If Christ wrote the song, Paul sung it and taught the world to sing along.

Well made, balanced, objective and well worth watching if only for a lesson in how not to stop a cult growing.

1986237,3,B0001BFDKK,"this is not a review, but the details of the film, copied from the DVD box:

Details
Christianity is a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people across the globe practicing the word of God, and paying fastidious attention to the pages of the Bible. It wasn't always that way, however, as journalist Peter Jennings illustrates in this fascinating exploration of early Christian beliefs. The teachings of Christianity can be traced back to Jesus and Paul, who set down some of the fundamental beliefs in their brief tenure on the planet. Focusing largely on Paul, Jennings shows how he set the religion apart from Judaism, the possible negative effects he had, and how he interacted with Jesus and his family. It all adds up to a fascinating piece of history that is both revealing and highly educational.

1986238,1,B0001BFDKK,"A friend of mine was so insistent that I see this TV show that I ordered it and watched it.  Her attitude was, ""How can you still think the way you do after seeing this show?""

Actually, now that I've seen it, it's easier to still think the way I do.  I believe that Jesus was and is the Son of God and it's going to take a lot more than ABC News to put a dent in that.  I'm not a crazed fanatic, I'm just convinced.

What I also believe is that Peter Jennings and the makers of this show have no idea who Jesus was and what he meant.  In fact, they appear to deliberately avoid anyone who might illuminate Christ in any other way than they see him: most of the ""scholars"" interviewed all have the same exact view of Christ.  That several of them belong to the Jesus Seminar, an odd group of arrogant blowhards who exist to draw publicity and tear Christianity down, throws the entire show's credibility out the window.

They talk about Jesus taking advantage of political situations, bending social meanings and disregarding huge chunks of biblical accounts.  Not for one second do they ever consider the possibility that God and the supernatural play any role in the life of Christ.  Some of the scholars look like they're ready to keel over with convulsions rather than admit that Jesus was anything more than a really super guy!

The title of this show includes the word Search...but they never bother to look anywhere outside of what they want to find.

There are some nice shots from the modern Holy Land though.",1127606400,19,1518,4.44043321299639
