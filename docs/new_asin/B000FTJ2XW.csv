2585491,5,B000FTJ2XW,"Best source of knowledge in relation to physics. I'm studying game programming and this dvd helps me alot in the physics programming part of the creation of the game engine.

Nothing bad about it.",1155600000,6,196,4.764705882352941
2585492,5,B000FTJ2XW,"Awesome as usual.  I've the math set of dvds, which are great.  This is no exception.  Same presentation style as the others.",1150934400,10,125,4.590909090909091
2585493,5,B000FTJ2XW,"What a wonderful product!  Great physics DVD for anyone who needs a little help.  Much cheaper than what I was spending on a ""real"" tutor and in many ways its even better because I can stop and rewind anytime I want if I need to hear something again.  This should be a required supplement to any Physics textbook!",1150675200,9,313,4.362068965517241
2585494,5,B000FTJ2XW,I was looking for a refresher as I dive back into physics.  This DVD is an outstanding product for anyone who is learning physics for the first time or anyone who needs to brush up on it for a test.,1150156800,10,198,3.95
2585495,5,B000FTJ2XW,"Great teacher that takes the time to explain the little things that trip you up.  One thing that always got me was the sign conventions.  Should positive be ""up"" or ""down""....and all that stuff.  This DVD really shines because through working all of the problems little things like this become clear.  And the ""little things"" are usually the ones that cause me to screw up the problems.  This DVD series is an absolute steal for what it provides to the student!",1149638400,15,461,4.6419753086419755
2585496,5,B000FTJ2XW,"I (and many classmates) had the problem that I'd think that I understood the lecture, but when it came to solving a homework problem I had no idea to begin.  This DVD really helped me get a grasp of how to set up a problem and solve it.  I had particular trouble with the equations of motion with gravity...this DVD covered it in awesome detail.  It also covers all of the unit conversions so I am no longer confused on how to do that either.  I have only scratched the surface of the DVD as I'm only 1/3 through it but so far it is fantastic!",1149379200,6,543,4.09433962264151
2585497,5,B000FTJ2XW,"I was blown away at the quality of instruction in this DVD!  The instructor takes his time and explains things without assuming you really know that much about this material...which is great for me because I am usually lost in class.  This is far, far greater than my instructor at school.",1149206400,3,289,4.647058823529412
2585498,5,B000FTJ2XW,"I already own the Calculus Tutor course by the same author, so I decided to give this one a try for my Physics class.  It is done in the same style, so if you like the other DVDs in the series you will love this one.  Just as before, all of the topics are taught by working example problems so you really get some practice in how to set up and solve the problems you'll encounter in class and on the test.

The best thing about this DVD set is that it covers so much.  It is much, much more comprehensive than anything else I have been able to find.  And on top of that, every topic that is covered is covered in enough detail to really help you out in class.  Too many times I have found that videos like these just scratch the surface and just introduce the topic without going into any detail - not so with this physics tutor.

If you are looking for a good DVD to help you out with understanding your Physics lecture and give you some guidance in working your homework problems then I believe that this DVD will help just about anyone out there.",1149120000,25,1049,4.137931034482759
2585529,5,B000FTJ2XW,physics is a hard subject ot learn and a hard subject to teach. This teacher is very thorough and  his demeanor is very pleasant and professional.,1385337600,,146,4.615384615384615
2585530,1,B000FTJ2XW,"Besides from the above, the 'lecturer', if that's what you'd call him, uses the term ""OK"" so much that it's just utterly irritating.

Don't waste your money on these DVD sets - just subscribe to Educator.com or KhanAcademy.com. This DVD is more like something from a class in a prison or army lesson.",1360454400,2,300,4.660377358490566
2585531,5,B000FTJ2XW,This is not the easiest course on physics but it's probably one of the better ones. You don't have to be a graduate from MIT to understand it.,1347580800,,142,4.107142857142857
2585532,5,B000FTJ2XW,"If you look at many of Jason's math videos you will see that I have reviewed a lot of them.  I am a big believer in his video series and I truly think, as someone who was horrible at math when I was younger, that they helped me a lot.  I wanted to take a little different route in this review than in some of the others partly in response to some of the comments I have seen posted about the videos.

What it is:

Just what it says, a tutor through DVD.  It is Jason standing in front of a white board doing physics problems.  He does a few examples of varying difficulty from each kind of problem.  It is a lecture style DVD.  He does not (for the most part) derive any of the formulas, he just gives you the formulas you have to use and shows you how to apply them.

It is more geared toward algebra based physics classes than those that are calculus based.  Although as anyone who has taken calculus based physics can tell you, a lot of times you don't really even use calculus to solve the problems (at least not in the simple one or two dimensional motion problems).  The calculus part of the class is to show how the formulas were derived, but when you solve the problems you primarily use algebra.  So, even though it will more closely resemble the lecture from a physics class that only requires algebra as a prerequisite, the principles you are learning are the same.

What it is not:

It is not a rah-rah physics is great DVD.  While you certainly get a sense that Jason is passionate about physics and knows his stuff, it is designed to help you learn how to do physics problems.  In some of the later sets there is a review by a person who claims to be a physics teacher who was mystified that this was not a DVD to get people interested in physics.  Despite the word TUTOR on the cover and the screen shots of a person in front of a white board doing problems, he was shocked to see that it was a lecture and that nobody pointed that out in a review.  So, consider it pointed out.

It is not a set with the hardest problems you are likely to encounter.  Many times on a test you will get compound problems that require you to solve for multiple things using the same information.  It is not uncommon to get a problem split up into 6 or 7 sub parts each asking you to solve for something different.  While you do get some of that in here, for the most part in the problems Jason picked he is showing you how to do one thing at a time.  Which is why it is imperative that you do problems from your book or whatever online programs your instructor requires you to use.  While you will come across very similar problems to what is here, your test questions are going to come from what your instructor assigns to you NOT from this DVD.  If you simply relied on this for your entire preparation and skipped class and homework you will more than likely fail.  Use this as a supplement.

It does also not cover every single kind of problem you will be exposed to.  Most semesters are about 15 weeks long, and for a physics class you will get 4 to 5 hrs of lecture per week and at least an hour of lab.  This entire DVD is 11 hours.  There is no way to get everything you are going to get in class onto an 11 hour DVD.  So again, be smart and do not skip class, and pay attention to what is going on in class.  If you use this correctly you will learn strategies for how to solve the problems, and even when you have to do something that was not covered on this DVD you will at least have an idea of how to approach it.

If used correctly this will absolutely help you, if your learning style is conducive to watching a recorded lecture.  Some people learn better from one-on-one instruction.  If that is you, then you would probably be better off hiring an actual tutor.  But if you can learn this way, I think Jason's style of teaching is great, and he breaks down what you need to know, and provides easy to follow step-by-step instructions.",1336867200,21,3948,4.189655172413793
2585533,5,B000FTJ2XW,"The shipping was fast, and the DVD has a good material explained very well. Also in the first part has a dimension analysis which is great if you are towards a science degree.",1330041600,,175,4.333333333333333
2585534,5,B000FTJ2XW,These videos are a must have for anyone taking physics.  Raised my grade from a D to A from one test to the next!,1323734400,,113,3.7083333333333335
2585535,5,B000FTJ2XW,This course helps my daughter a great deal. She started the series over the summer as prep for her course and she uses it as additional review material throughout the course.,1318550400,,174,4.645161290322581
2585536,5,B000FTJ2XW,This video takes the anxiety out of physics.  He gives you confidence with the basics and is very easy to follow.  I recommend Jason Gibson's videos to everyone!,1299024000,,161,4.714285714285714
2585537,4,B000FTJ2XW,"I enjoyed his Calculus Tutor (after having a tough time with the subject) and this Physics Tutor helped a great deal too. It's interesting because he doesn't do anything special, but simply breaks the subjects down and communicates the concepts in a very simple fashion. The DVD's certainly need to be used in conjunction with your text books, but will certainly help you get out of a rut if you're going over the same pages too many times for your liking.",1292284800,2,456,4.6419753086419755
2585538,3,B000FTJ2XW,"I didn't raise my overall grade, but I believe the dvd's helped me understand some chapters a bit better.",1279065600,3,105,4.578947368421052
2585559,4,B000FTJ2XW,these dvds give you a clear understanding of formulas and what problems are asking you to find. the examples are helpful and are worked step by step.,1267574400,,149,4.555555555555555
2585560,5,B000FTJ2XW,"I used this course to get through my Non-Calculus Based Physics I class.  I had a teacher that wasn't so great at explaining things.  After watching this series and working through the problems in my book, I passed the course with an A.  I'm getting the others for Physics II.",1264291200,,276,4.48
2585561,5,B000FTJ2XW,"This product is great for really grasping both qualitative and quantitative aspects of physics! I was initially skeptical, and was actually really worried, but after viewing his dvd, I feel much more confident in tackling physics problems, a feeling I couldn't get with tutorial websites or other physics textbooks.

I go to Northwestern University, and the physics curriculum is intense; this DVD really saved my life, and my physics grade. It's also a great tool for anyone prepping for the MCAT!

The price might seem high to some, but it's worth the investment because it's money effectively spent, and so much time saved.

The tutor also offers other tutorial videos [...]

I highly recommend this DVD!",1260230400,4,707,5.068965517241379
2585562,4,B000FTJ2XW,"It's good, but it will not help you pass your exam on it's own. You will need to study and remember that you'll get out of the subject what you put into it. That said, he does answer some questions for those struggling with the fundamentals.",1218240000,2,241,4.260869565217392
2585563,5,B000FTJ2XW,"I have all his DVD's. The lessons are great. They cover the basics that are important in the class. Of course not all information is covered in the DVD's. Think of it as an overview of hot topics. I have used these DVD's before I took a class and them reviewed them along the way. I also have purchased some of the idoit and dummy guides as a type of work book. They all together give you a different way to look at the math martial. Because as you know, most math books are written by brainy math folks, and they are not the easiest to follow.",1212192000,2,544,4.093457943925234
2585564,5,B000FTJ2XW,"This is the study aid to have, bar none. If you are reading this then you probably need this. For the price it is a steal. Fast and efficient, I'm making mathematical connections I could never make in class simply because class went to slow. This study aid is single handedly getting me through my physics 1111 class. If only there was a second physics tutor mini course for the next class in my two class sequence. (Author take note)",1205107200,2,434,4.4375
2585565,5,B000FTJ2XW,"Let me say that this guy is a master at teaching the art of physics. I listened to a few chapters to determine the value for my daughter after purchase, and quite frankly, I was very pleasantly surprised.

The ""doctor"" grounds the listener into the basics and foundation of the concepts, and then incrementally extends to introduce simple to increasingly more difficult problems, without losing the listener. My daughter got ALOT of value and support from using this product.

I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with physics. Your grades will definitely increase!!!",1193961600,9,583,5.191489361702128
2585566,4,B000FTJ2XW,"Although this product doesn't cover ALL the basics in college phys, it deffinately helped me understand some concepts I was having trouble with. I would recomend this product to others.",1193011200,3,185,5.2
2585567,4,B000FTJ2XW,"This DVD set is definitely not an ultimate physics tutor, but it does give a good explanation of ""Mechanical"" physics. However, the rest of physics is not mentioned, like ""Mechanical Waves & Oscillatory Motion"", ""Thermodynamics"", ""Electricity & Magnetism"", ""Light & Optics"" and ""Modern Physics"".
If this program was titled ""The Ultimate 101 Phyisics Tutor"" then I would have rated it with 5 stars because it's excellent for someone who's taking a first course in physics.
Other than that, simplicity combined with conciseness in presentation makes this program superb in relaying knowledge, without the need for fancy animations or vague concepts.

P.S. The above review was written before the author made a sequel which is about Thermodynamics. The author is fantastic and should be commended for his work. I hope he continues on with this material and completes the physics topics.",1178841600,22,883,5.307142857142857
2585568,5,B000FTJ2XW,"Everyone taking their first physics course or needing a brush up on elementary physics would benefit tremendously from viewing this masterpiece.  I know I did! In a beautifully minimilist setting (just a talking head with a 3-foot whiteboard), you watch Jason Gibson solve all the basic problems in a style that is personal and light-hearted yet never infantile. It is great fun to watch and really educational. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.",1174003200,36,445,4.933333333333334
8126483,3,B000FTJ2XW,"When the questions appear on the screen that Jason answers, the questions are often littered with typos - beginning to end.  The questions themselves would be hard enough to figure out and concentrate on even if they were typed correctly.  Questions like these deserve full concentration and comprehension... Yet during the whole course, there might easily be 10 typos or more that appear.  The student shouldn't be confused by typos while simultaneously trying to figure out the answers.  A little extra time just to double check his work when entering the questions in the computer would've gone a long way.  It seems as if Jason entered the questions in, and didn't bother to reread them at all... Which seems strange to me.  Due to his rushing, this course was more confusing than it should've been.

Fortunately, in his later courses, it seems he learned his lesson.",1512777600,,871,4.924657534246576
8126484,5,B000FTJ2XW,Very helpful. Wonderful supplement for my son's class. Good examples and great explanations.,1477440000,,92,6.153846153846154

8126486,5,B000FTJ2XW,This guy is awesome!  My son likes him more than some of his teachers.  Any math issues he has a DVD for it.  Excellent at explaining Math!  Well worth the money cheeper than a tudor and you can go at your own pace.,1457740800,,215,3.9302325581395348
8126487,5,B000FTJ2XW,Jason! Thank you so much for teaching my physics.  Your videos are saving me in my physics course.  Thank you!!!,1454803200,,112,4.55
8126488,5,B000FTJ2XW,The most amazing and useful DVD by far.  It can turn an D student into an A student without much effort.  You must of course actually look at it but it is so easy to understand.  Real great investment,1431907200,,200,4.076923076923077

8126491,5,B000FTJ2XW,"I have struggled in advanced college physics since it has been over ten years since high school physics and thanks to this dvd I was able not only to understand and catch up, but now I am excelling.  He goes over important basic problems used all the time in physics and explains how from ch 1 to the later chapters that everything builds upon the basics. Thanks to this dvd i am no longer overwhelmed and I finally get it. My ah-ha moment finally arrived and now i can help explain concepts and problem solving methods to other students.",1402358400,3,538,4.434343434343434
8126492,4,B000FTJ2XW,"I viewed this with my daughter.  It demonstrates step-by-step on how to do each problem.  The only reason my daughter did not like it was it did not show short-cuts in doing the problems.  She said if she had to do it his way, she would never get her tests done in class on time.  These CD's are excellent for the person who needs to know how to do the math formulas.  If you already know how to do them and need the short cuts, as in my daughter's case, it doesn't show these.  Perhaps a different CD has them.  For me, I wished I had known about these CD's when I had Physics.  I really struggled in class and spent hours researching how to do the math.  These CD's would have been a life saver for me.",1386288000,4,704,4.043478260869565
