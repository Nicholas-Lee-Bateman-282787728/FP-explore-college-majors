1752709,4,B00006G8HJ,This should be a staple for dance educators/dance history classes. The 30 minute intro shows Martha Graham speaking passionately about her work and shows her dancers in a studio setting. It really captures the era of early Modern dance.,1225584000,,236,5.076923076923077
1752710,5,B00006G8HJ,This is one ofa few realy good dance documentaries ever made. I wish all dance documentaries would be so useful. I think every dancer should have this in the library.,1202515200,2,166,4.566666666666666
1752711,4,B00006G8HJ,"I should first declare an interest. Despite having been turned on to dance in the first place by the London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Martha Graham's British offshoot in the 1970s and 80s, I'm not a great Graham fan. Most of my objections I guess relate to the technique: I struggled with it for several years, but only really learned to dance once I threw Graham out of the window.

Having said that, the three films on this DVD offer a really fascinating insight into Graham's work from a particular moment in time (the late 1950s). At this time Graham's company did not have the international acclaim that came in the 1960s and 70s. Graham was still dancing major roles, but she was not at the height of her powers (she was in her early 60s).

The first work on the DVD is a film about the Company, in which Graham talks about her work (while getting ready for the role of Jocasta in Night Journey, the next piece on the DVD). It's interesting to hear Graham talk, to hear her ideas about theatre and dance, but otherwise this film is just a rather extended demonstration class.

Night Journey, the second piece, is more interesting. Here, Graham's age fits quite well with the role she plays - Jocasta, mother (and wife) of Oedipus in her final moments, just before she kills herself. I have always disliked the fact that Graham technique doesn't really allow a dancer to let movement flow through their body: the movement is first bottled up and then released in a great burst. However, when you see the technique used in Graham's own work, with its incredible economy, intensity and focus, you can see exactly why she danced like this.

The final piece on the DVD is Appalachian Spring, Graham's hymn to American freedom and the pioneer spirit with music by Aaron Copeland. This has always been one of my favourite Graham pieces, and this 1950s performance is great. Graham plays the young pioneer bride, which is slightly bizarre, but despite her age the performance is nothing short of astonishing. After Graham stopped dancing, her company changed somewhat in style, and the movement became softer and more fluid. However, in this performance, and in Night Journey, you can still see the angularity and jagged energy of her work, and how radically it differed from ballet. Appalachian Spring has all the taut economy and intensity of Night Journey, but it has less angst, more expansiveness, and quite a bit of humour. A wonderful finish to this fascinating DVD.",1191628800,9,2473,4.757575757575758

1752713,5,B00006G8HJ,"Martha Graham is commonly recognized as one of the most important contributors to the art of American dance during this past century. She realized significant innovations in the fields of choreography, dance performance, lighting, stage design, costuming and also commissioned new music from contemporary composers for her various works.

Graham was born in Pennsylvania in 1894.  In 1910, she witnessed a performance by Ruth Saint-Denis and decided that she wanted to become a dancer.  After some preliminary theater and dance studies at the University of Cumnoch, in 1916 Graham enrolled in the Denishawn School, run by Ruth Saint-Denis and Ted Shawn.  For the next eight years, Graham thrived at Denishawn as both a student and an instructor.  The Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance was opened in 1926 and by 1939, her modern dance company began touring the United States and Cuba. After some thirty years of prolific activity, at the age 76, Martha Graham announced her retirement from the performance stage.

This Kultur DVD, ""Martha Graham: In Performance"", features three works choreographed specifically for black and white film camera during the years 1957, 1961 and 1958.  It begins with a 30-minute demonstration film, ""A Dancer's World"", where Ms. Graham introduces the viewer to her company and gives an intimate glimpse into the exercises that precede the performance of a dance piece.

Next come ""Night Journey"" and ""Appalachian Spring"", two different works of ""dance for camera"".  Alexander Hammid, a husband of experimental filmmaker Maya Deren, directed ""Night Journey"".  The camera is used as an integral component of the stage choreography; with different viewing angles and camera positions only being possible by staging particular short sequences within the choreography, then editing the segments together to form a smoothly flowing whole.  ""Appalachian Spring"" is a cinematic interpretation for Graham's choreography of a Quaker wedding.  It will likely remain as one of her best-remembered works.

All three films document well the signature Graham dance style that consists of abrupt contraction and release of different parts of the body; the intimate relation of the dancer's breathing to emotion and movement; positions of austere, angular body line; and close dancer proximity to the ground.

""Martha Graham: In Performance"" is a film document of significant historical importance.  Any self-respecting fan of dance should own a copy of this DVD to aid in their personal study, and reflection on, one of the great artist's of our time.",1121904000,27,2574,5.4
1752714,5,B00006G8HJ,"This videotape is a tribute to one of the greatest dancers and choreographers of the 20th century. It is done in black and white and actually, this makes it even better, for it serves to concentrate attention on the dance forms and the many abstractions that so characterize the Graham technique. There are three parts of the tape: 1. ""A Dancer's World"", which is 30-minutes long and shows Graham and her company demonstrating dance expression and techniques. Viewers can see Graham in the dressing room, in the studio, and dancing herself. 2. ""Night Journey"", which is my all time favorite piece by Graham. Graham dances the part of Jocasta, Paul Taylor as Tiresais, and Bertram Ross as Oedipus. 3. ""Appalachian Spring"", which is the most popular of Graham's works, is accompanied by the music of Aaron Copland.
  All of the parts exemplify the mystery and majesty of this pioneer of modern dance. Graham is unrelenting in her expression, things are never subtle in her dances, and she always (delightfully) comes across with an overabundance of passion. Given the length of time she actually performend on stage, one can only feel a deep sense of respect and awe at this incredible woman.",996537600,58,1190,4.91542288557214

7968192,5,B00006G8HJ,The Martha Graham is the Mother of Modern Dance!  She was the first to pass on ballet and move on to her style of dance which created many other dancers who followed in her footsteps and choreography.  She was truly one of the greatest dancers of all times.  This is a wonderful look at the woman who made what we call Modern Dance!,1411084800,,332,4.238095238095238

7968195,5,B00006G8HJ,"Wonderful, historical footage of Martha Graham and members of her dance company.  Great tool to use in my dance history class.  Nice mix of actual interview footage with Graham and footage of her actual choreography and her dancing.",1320451200,,232,5.078947368421052
7968196,5,B00006G8HJ,"For those like myself, without any technical or connoisseurs knowledge of the Dance, this fine DVD serves as both Martha Grahams explanation of her approach to her work and examplars of that work. The first half hour of the  90 minutes of performance, all are in black and white and shot for the camera, contains her explanation of the dancer's life, together with studio demonstrations by her talented group. These are not exercises, they are designed for purpose and place by Graham and are quite impressive demonstrations of the art. The second and third self-contained dances are also conceived (and danced by Graham and her students), have visual designs by Isamu Naguchi, with music, first by William Schuman and second by Aaron Copland (Appalachian Spring). Once again, they are striking to my naive eyes, rewarding in themselves, and enlightening as to the nature of one of the influential forces in modern dance. I did not notice any fault with the film, although there may have been, since I am familiar with none of the numbers. Having been designed for black and white filming, good use is made of its strengths and little feels lost, the camera work is superior, thanks, no doubt, in part to the dance being focused on the camera as audience surrogate.
Others have recommended these films for the initiate; certainly, I can second that vote, by commending it to any viewer who simply likes to see the dance without any deeper appreciation through training or other educational mechanisms. It should be mentioned that Paul Taylor appears as one of Graham's students.",1274572800,,1578,4.9547169811320755
7968197,5,B00006G8HJ,"This video is a great resource for all dance teachers, especially if you are in a public school setting. I am a dance teacher at an elementary school where I teach using dance standards, but I also go into the regualar classroom to teach their standards through dance. I have used this video for lessons on Drawing conclusions, westward expansion, and myths. This is a great video!",1239753600,,381,4.701492537313433
7968198,5,B00006G8HJ,"If you are looking for examples of Martha Graham's works, this DVD gives you 3 lovely performances.  However, if you want these performances explained and have a desire to have more background information about Graham and her company etc. I would recommend purchasing the 2 DVD set called ""Martha Graham Dance on Film"" which includes all 3 of these performances plus more.",1231459200,2,372,5.0
