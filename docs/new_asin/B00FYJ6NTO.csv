8619466,3,B00FYJ6NTO,"""Die Hard"" is the great one & ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is not so great. I would not have purchased as I knew the reviews for  AGDTDH was not good but the price was right. My problem with AGDTDH was the plot was pretty weak. Very predictable....anyways don't waste your money on AGDTDH. Just but ""Die Hard"" alone.",1393113600,,312,4.2
