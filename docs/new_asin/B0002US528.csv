2120515,4,B0002US528,"""The very man who has argued you down, will sometimes be found, years later, to have been influenced by what you said.""  - C.S. Lewis

This movie was made before the Anthony Hopkins/Debra Winger version of ""Shadowlands"".  It's pacing and presentation are clearly more British, more BBC.  I appreciated that even though the movies are similar in length, follow the same plot, similar scene progressions, and use identical dialogue at times - this version acted the same dialogue differently.  It's wonderful to see the same material interpreted in good ways. And this movie adds different dialogue.  Including the following:

C.S. Lewis:  ""I never knew what I was supposed to say.  What do you say when your mother is dying?""
Joy:  ""There's nothing like dying to make you realize you're not in charge.""
C.S. Lewis:  ""Yes there is.  Loving someone does that too.""

The story is about facing mortality.  Or said another way, facing the loss of life, where the loss is losing the interactive life force of another person you love.

C.S. Lewis is speaking with a professor colleague when C.S. Lewis is doing all he can to fight Joy's cancer.  C.S. Lewis, using all his tangible & intangible efforts (the best doctors, the best hospitals, prayer, becoming learned on the medical conditions, etc.), is powerless to effect positive health restoring change for Joy.  And the professor says, ""I've never seen you really want something before.  I was wondering what you'd say if you didn't get it.""

In Joy Gresham, C.S. Lewis found someone who had not only considered atheism, religions, & diverse politics intelligently and independently, but he also found someone who understood & interpretted him uncommonly well.  C.S. Lewis had encountered thousands of students, fellow intellectuals, literary critics, and learned fans.  Yet he understood how rare Joy was in interaction with him.

In the Debra Winger film, Joy is extremely challenging & critical.  C.S. Lewis eventually appreciates that Joy speaks on the topics everyone else in his circle of friends and family agrees to not challenge him on.  Joy shows him his unspoken cultural, social, & literary boundaries and he slowly and grudgingly admires her loving, yet sometimes uncomfortable honesty.  ""Americans don't understand about inhibitions.""

In this BBC version, Joy is portrayed as smart, but she holds her tongue far more.  She is less demanding & challenging.  She still has genuinely rare perspectives and a willingness to spar with him.  Her portrayal seems more consistent with general expectations of women of that generation.

I don't know whether Joy was more consistent with either actress' interpretation.  I would guess that for as much as C.S. Lewis appeared to love her and be disarmed by her, she was probably capable of alternating between both ""roles"" for him, adapting with his feedback.  Whoever Joy actually was, he knew the combination of Joy's talents & their genuinely enlightening conversations would be lost forever in her absence.  And while he had a keen mind, great education, and exceptional intelligent social circles, replacing her loss would in the end be impossible.  He could focus on all the other positives available to him and create similar chemistries with others.  He could encourage and grow all those things in her absence, but her absence would always be a unique loss to him intellectually and socially.

The movie capably frames the question of:  What do you do when you lose a rare human being you love?  What do you do when you realize that loss will be for the rest of your life?  What are humans to do with that reality, from either religious or atheistic perspectives?  These issues are important because, regardless of religious perspective, they face everyone who has been loved well.

While Joy is still aside him, C.S. Lewis says in a radio address, ""Most people know that they want something that cannot be had in this world.  One has a glimpse of a country where everyone there is filled with something we should call goodness, as a mirror is filled with light.  They do not call it goodness.  They do not call it anything.  They are too busy looking at the source from which it comes.  But this is near the stage where the road passes over the rim of our world.  No one's eyes can see very beyond that.""

When C.S. Lewis faced losing someone he really wanted to stay in communication with (the loss of his mother, the loss of Joy, the loss of his wife), he wrote.  He found words to say.  Why did he write?  To tell everyone his ideas?  Maybe.  But I give him more credit, intellect, and good intent.  I think he wrote in part to attempt to have a similar effect on the world that those women had on him.  Through his writing, the positive lifeforces of the women in his life and their uncommonly good interchange of oppositions, were possibly shared with others.  Mere love.",1158796800,83,4886,4.8914634146341465
2120516,5,B0002US528,A very moving loving detail of C S Lewis and Joy's life humaningly done.,1155859200,,72,4.214285714285714
2120517,5,B0002US528,"""Shadowlands"" (or ""Through The Shadowlands,"" as it's frequently called,) started as a stage play, became this extroidnary BBC production, then a severly edited American video, then an American theatrical feature starring Anthony Hopkins, and then a book. Obviously, this story's impact resinates and remains powerful through different interpretation and versions. This presentation stands above all of them, though.

This DVD includes BOTH the full length 90 minute BBC version, as well as a worthless 73 minute version, which was released on video in the states for ""Christian"" markets. Regretfully, that abridged 73 minute video is what most people in the US mistakenly think is the ""original BBC"" movie. That jumpy and truncated version was done without input or approval from the director, Norman Stone, and aparently exists solely because someone wanted all alcohol and smoking removed. Therefore, scenes of Lewis discussing his beliefs with skeptical Oxford dons are gone, because the professors are holding cigars and brandy. The Christmas Holiday scenes are also cut because there is wine on the dinner table, etc, depriving the viewer of significant and pivital elements of the tightly constructed story and character development. The releasing studio's ""justification"" for the chopped up version was that it could be used for church classes or discussion groups becuase it's shorter. However, it only saves 15 minutes, which certianly doesn't justify the tremendous loss to the narative.

Josh Ackland's portrayal of Lewis is relentlessly engaging to watch. Lewis' brilliance, confidence, and joy, with intellectual and spiritual pursuits is completely brought to the screen. Without it, his sense of loss, anger, questioning, and understanding could never of had the subsequent impact on the viewer.

Claire Bloom is also completely believable as the Jewish, intellectual, Christian, articulate, single mother who eventually melts Lewis' heart. However, when compared to the performance of Debra Winger in the theatrical version, Claire Bloom definately comes across as much more of an English woman than Debra Winger's portrayal, which actually sounds like a Jewish woman from New York, as she should.

Beyond the fresh, and possibly more accurate, performance by Debra Winger in the theatrical version, this BBC production is superior in almost every way. I say, ""almost"" because, as others have pointed out, the music in this production doesn't rise to the quality of every other aspect. Not only is the music fairly pedantic, but it's not mixed particularly well, either, and tends to stand out more than it should.

Rising HIGH above any shortcomings, this movie is one of my all-time favorites, and retains all of its' magic, brilliance, and wisdom, through repeated viewings. I can not praise this film highly enough, and I only hope that the recent success of the feature film ""Narnia"" will introduce new viewers to this masterwork.",1145491200,237,2951,5.420479302832244
2120518,4,B0002US528,"this film is a monumentally better depiction of the events and faith of C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy. Joss Ackland is excellent as Lewis and the faith that drove and sustained lewis is never undermined by hollywood emotionalism as in the Attenburough film staring Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is just outright boring and dull witted as Lewis.

2120519,3,B0002US528,"In nearly every way, this television adaptation is more satisfying & certainly better acted than the better known movie of the same name.  As C.S. Lewis, Joss Ackland is far more heartbreaking & believable than Anthony Hopkins.  In the movie, Hopkins does his put-upon somnambulist act that he has used so often before (e.g., ""The Remains of the Day""); Ackland, by contrast, presents a wrenching portrait of a man who awakens to the possibility of love just as that love is snatched away from him.  And it's hard to imagine a finer performance than Claire Bloom's.  She must be the most overlooked actress in the world.  She seems incapable of giving a bad performance.

But this television production is marred by the excruciating music throughout.  I wonder what author Wm. Nicholson thought of it when he first heard that ghastly music polluting his beautiful screenplay?  The dreadful score makes the television production very nearly unwatchable.  If only it could be eliminated, I expect I'd give the show five stars.  As it is, three is generous.",1124236800,37,1053,4.965714285714285

2120535,4,B0002US528,"Having just finished a journey through C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity"" with a church small group, we watched this BBC production of ""Shadowlands"" to get a better sense of who this amazing author really was.  And even if there were some spots that made us fully aware that we were watching something several decades old, we were not disappointed.

The beauty of this production is its deliberate subtlety.  It is slow, painfully slow at times.  But that bolstered my sense of authenticity about the whole thing, as I suspect that I probably need a heavy dose of slowness to pull my 21st-century American self back from the frenzy that seems normal to me, to instead capture the pace of life for a mid-20th-century Oxford don (both culturally and individually).  It was a different world than what I know, and watching this film felt like I had entered that different world.  I loved that part of the experience.

And the performances, especially the two leads (Lewis and his eventual-wife Joy), were wonderful, careful, and nuanced.  There wasn't much bluster, but the powerful story and its fascinating characters didn't require any.  There was simplicity to the whole thing that just seemed to make sense.  This spirit of simplicity permeated the dialogue, the musical score, and the sets, all very British, very dated, and very authentic.  I loved the choice to show a glimpse of Lewis' radio broadcasts which eventually became ""Mere Christianity,"" the frequent references to his renowned Narnia books, and even the portrayal of the conversations between Lewis and his fellow Inklings.  And there were a few laugh-out-loud moments for me, not totally surprising, given Lewis' dry sense of humor that permeates his writing and the unfiltered spunk that Joy introduced into his life.

But, to be sure, this story is not light and fluffy.  The viewer doesn't finish the film in some sort of euphoria or enraptured delight but is left instead to ponder significant ideas like death, pain, loss, suffering, heaven, love, and hope.  I would suggest that these are topics worth our consideration.  The film, in the spirit of Lewis, does not attempt to offer trite and tidy answers to the big questions.  Instead, it offers us food for thought and context for reflection.

I wouldn't argue that this is some sort of perfect film.  What it lacks in production values (in contrast to the more polished Hollywood version produced ten years later), it captures with heart.  And it's a good and solid film, worthy of 90 minutes for anyone interested in the life of Lewis, the setting for his classic literary works, his honest reflections about grief and death, and the slice of culture and history in which those ideas were created.  I'm happy to recommend the film...",1460764800,2,2758,4.952173913043478

The love, grief, pain and sorrow were so shattering to Lewis that his basic Christian beliefs, magnificently communicated in his many books, were now called into serious doubt. But he picked up the pieces and moved out of the depressing ""shadowlands,"" realising that ""real life has not even begun yet."" In my opinion the BBC's best ever drama, it won over a dozen prestigious awards including the International Emmy for Best Drama and two British Academy Awards.
""Kaleidoscope"" magazine described it thus at the time: ""It explores the deepest spiritual values. It is about love and death in a very real way...

He was also a confirmed bachelor, but struck up a friendship w/American poet, Joy Davidman Gresham; and later agreed to a marriage of convenience after she was divorced to enable her and her two sons to stay in England. But what began as an act of charity became a deep and abiding love and they married again ""before God"". Then Gresham becomes gravely ill, causing Lewis to question his faith. This is a superb BBC TV production of the true story that was later adapted into a Hollywood theatrical production. Joss Ackland as Lewis and Claire Bloom as Joy, each deliver outstanding performances; Bloom won a BAFTA for her performance. The 1993 theatrical film directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Anthony Hopkins and Deborah Winger is also outstanding.

I have read Lewis' auto-biographical work (Surprised By Joy), as well as his brother's biography, his wife's biography, his step-son's biography, and the biography of the Inklings (the Christian writers group that Lewis was in, along with Tolkien), as well as reading almost every other book Lewis has written.  I also directed the Atlanta premiere of the stage version of this movie.  And I can tell you that the Hollywood/Hopkins version gives a very poor presentation of the true passion and enduring faith of C.S. Lewis.

The BBC version (the version I am reviewing here), is not only acted well by Joss Acklund and Claire Bloom, but presents a man who would never deny the underlying Christian meaning of his books and life (as opposed to the Hollywood version). And it presents a man who, yes, went through some deep valleys of despair, but ultimately came out with his faith in Jesus Christ very much intact. (Unlike the Hollywood movie, which regularly plays down his Christian faith and ends with a broken Lewis looking to an agnostic student for answers.)

2120609,5,B0002US528,"I love the film with Anthony Hopkins, but this version seems more real to me.

Anthony Hopkins still seems rather good-looking even as an older man.  C.S. Lewis was not good looking, brown teeth through years of smoking.  Joss Ackland looks more nearer the man he's playing, like a pair of well worn slippers.  Claire Bloom, looked like a mature woman whose bloom of youth had faded.  Debra Winger was far too sexy looking.  This version also included both of her boys, Douglas and David.  The boys seemed like normal boys too - not so meek and mild as the boy in the Hollywood film.

I liked the format also.  It had that rainy-day Sunday feel about it.  Two old batchelors would have that kind of feel.  Joy Davidman may have swept Lewis off his feet, but he'd still be Lewis and Warnie would still be Warnie - two old batchelors - one just in love.  Anthony Hopkins quacking like Donald Duck to Douglas in one scene of the film, doesn't seem quite right.  I don't think Lewis really knew how to relate to a real child.  Reading Douglas Greshams book, I don't think Lewis or Joy really had much time for the kids - they were just swept up with themselves.

I had read about the film in Andre Agassi's biography and was intrigued to watch it given the depth of story and Oxford setting and purchased the Hopkins/Winger version (3.99 on Amazon.co.uk) and found it extremely moving - really lots of tears! When I read Amazon review's of that film I discovered the existence of the BBC Ackland/Bloom version I became intrigued at the story differences and strong reviews of this version and unable to find it online in uk I purchased via Amazon.com for $17.99 plus postage total around 20. This version is much less tear-jerking but moving nonetheless. I cannot provide intellectual comment as other reviewers have as I do not know Lewis's work well and do not hold strong religious views. I did however enjoy both films. Hopkins/Winger I now realise was Hollywood-ised but I loved the beautiful scenery of Oxford colleges and Symonds Yat and the portrayal of the love story and death of Joy; the Ackland/Bloom version tells the story with less emotion and obviously more correct detail. I find it amazing that the American version shows the existence of only one son and hence misses the obvious comparisons with CS Lewis and his brother whose mother died also when they were young, and I can only wonder what effect this may have had on the elder son in real life. Thought provoking dvd and well worth the effort to purchase via USA and to compare both versions.

  Two main points- Joy had two sons David and Douglas, not just one.

  C S Lewis was a Christian. In the Hollywood version Anthony Hopkins portrays Lewis as an almost neurotic, inhibited man, which he wasn't.  He enjoyed his friends and often laughed, telling and listening to jokes. In the Hollywood version, Hopkins, as Lewis, replies to a friend that Narnia was not Christian- but ""it's magic"".

The two screenplays follow each other quite closely, but I got more from Ackland's realization of someone who (as another character puts it) is ""the non-playing captain"" in life suddenly thrust onto the field, where humiliation and doubt almost consume him. Bloom is astonishing in her part - from the New York accent and mannerisms to the terrible and convincing descent into pain and death. The supporting cast are superb.

Although there are liberties taken with the facts this version so captures the humane spirit of Lewis that it makes up for all that. I believe it was his friend and physician Dr Havard(the UBQ or useless quack as Lewis called him fondly) who upon viewing this film said that though Ackland looked and sounded nothing like his friend 'Jack' did none-the less manage to convey him in an uncannily accurate fashion.

I have always felt that because I read Lewis throughout my growing up years, his ideology and viewpoint have shaped the very way I think.  I felt that this depiction of Lewis was true to the person he was, the way he thought, and the way he lived.  For much of the movie he continually denies his love for Joy, not so much to others as to himself.  Not being one to let emotions rule him, he had trouble recognizing the depth of his feeling for Joy.  However, when he finally let himself see it, his love for her added depth and dimension to life that he hadn't known was missing, like suddenly seeing a picture in 3-D.  Although that depth brings pain as well as pleasure, he comes to realize that not to have opened himself up to the pain of love is in some way not to have lived.  The depiction of Lewis' loss made me weep, not just for him as for all of us who lose the ones we have let ourselves love.  This movie was both an enjoyable experience and a challenge to accept the fullness that life offers.  After all, God himself gave us life, not just to exist but to live fully.",1173744000,16,1249,4.2100840336134455

Having been profoundly moved by the BBC movie, when I went to see the Anthony Hopkins/Debra Winger thing I was disgusted. It's just a major studio going for the bucks, using the inherent pathos of the story, but not understanding it at all, or caring. The BBC version was much more focused on, and aware of, background, implications, details, etc... and it is quite likely that they actually knew who C.S. Lewis was.

And why on Earth would the Hollywood hotshots change the real story by reducing Joy's offspring to ONE son, when she had two?

2120626,5,B0002US528,"""C.S. Lewis Through the Shadowlands"" is a beautiful love story and a sensitive portrayal of grief. In this BBC television special, we find American poet Joy Gresham (Claire Bloom) writing to C.S. Lewis in England. As they discuss ideas about mythical doors and poetry, her letters bring about an intellectual friendship. I love the part where Joy talks about wandering into the wrong houses as she is looking for a home.

When C.S. Lewis asks her if she thinks she has found a home, she says she thinks she has. It is very cute and sentimental. The story progresses from a winter of Joy's marriage dying to the full blossoming of her love with C.S. Lewis. The focus of this movie is on the relationship and nothing much is said about any of the books, except there are a few conversations where Joy shows she has a complete knowledge of the books he has written.

If you have read ""A Grief Observed"" or if you have an interest in finding out more about C.S. Lewis' personal life, then this will introduce you to the warmth of Joy and the caring nature of C.S. Lewis.

If you are looking for information on the life and work of C.S. Lewis, may I recommend ""The Magic Never Ends."" It is truly fascinating and includes a list of his 38 books and more information on books written about his life.
