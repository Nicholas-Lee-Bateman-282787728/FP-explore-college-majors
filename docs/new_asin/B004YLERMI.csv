8448511,3,B004YLERMI,"I'm a bit disappointed with this DVD. It is more of an advanced workout than I was hoping for. Not having used a roller before,  I found this work out incredibly tough and uncomfortable on my back. I suffer from frequent back pain and was hoping to learn more massage techniques with the roller. Only the last 5-10 min. do they show how to use the roller for massage, and not for the back. In addition, props are required that I didn't have; that would have been helpful to know before ordering.  Apparently since I opened and watched it I am now stuck w/it and can't return it. Would not recommend for a beginner like me.",1485216000,,622,4.353448275862069

8448516,5,B004YLERMI,"I've been working with foam rollers for several years, and this DVD had some new exercises I hadn't tried before.  I would say this is an intermediate to advanced workout.",1396483200,5,171,4.7
8448517,5,B004YLERMI,"I recently purchased a foam roller as I was told it really gave you a great massage and was awesome for sore muscles to work the knots out.  It came with a 20 minute massage workout but I was wanting a more indepth video.  Foam roller workouts are hard to find I found out after I started looking.  I found this video and ordered it.  It is a great workout, really works all areas of your body as well as massages out sore troubled spots.  I found a couple more videos but like this one best.  So if you are looking for a foam roller workout, this is a good one.",1359331200,17,562,4.018018018018018
