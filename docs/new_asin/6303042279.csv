7836287,2,6303042279,I'll give two stars because the audio was so bad that I had to crank up the volume on my TV to the highest point and I still could not make heads or tails what the people were saying! What a rip off! Although I liked the idea of the movie in dealing with good and evil. I understand that how things were back then with no big budget for making the movie. The blacks had to use what was given them and they made history! I will still invest in these hard to find films.,1095206400,,468,3.8854166666666665
7836288,4,6303042279,"Sunday Sinners is a fascinating film.  Frankly, I was surprised to find a film from 1940 featuring an all African-American cast.  While there are some stereotypical aspects to this film, by and large it is an earnest production espousing a serious message.  The local church is upset because a night club is open for business on Sunday nights, luring some of the congregation's younger members away from the Sunday night services.  The minister is by and large an easy-going fellow, having no objection to properly chaperoned dancing, but even he cannot abide dancing on the Lord's Day.  Club Harlem has a few problems of its own, quite aside from money.  Some gangsters down from the city try to put the squeeze on the owner, who must also deal with a cheating, deceitful wife.  There are several subplots, one involving the minister's son who takes a job at the club, which all converge into an exciting conclusion.
Despite its length of only sixty-five minutes, Sunday Sinners is full of all kinds of entertaining and exciting action.  First, there is the music; the film features a number of great songs belted out by the likes of Mamie Smith; and the numerous dance scenes are all fun to watch.  There is adultery, a knife attack, a shooting, a couple of Sunday sermons, outraged church parishioners, a bona fide catfight, and even a brawling preacher with fists of godly fury.  I loved it.  In opposition to all of the movie's serious goings-on, there is a comedic subplot here as well.  The minister's brother-in-law is a man in the Kingfish tradition, always in need of ""some capital"" for his endless supply of crazy, get-rich-quick schemes.  Eventually, he and the club bartender go out and try to buy the swamp land owned by a local Chinese man; this trio delivers a ready supply of buffoonery to the script, and I could not help laughing at some of their crazy antics.
By addressing the issue of good vs evil and placing it in the context of the real world's sin vs the interests of the church, Sunday Sinners offers at least a partial glimpse into African-American life in 1940; at least, I think it certainly attempts to.  Thus, I would not consider this an exploitation film at all.  The acting and plot leave something to be desired at times, but overall this is a fine, interesting, even historic film that remains relevant even in our own time.",1062028800,7,2361,4.724390243902439
7836289,4,6303042279,"I had to watch this movie twice before I got what was going on. There aren't any plots, not that I could spot. (A little rhyme there) Anyway, I only liked one scene, and that was when two Afro American guys were walking out in the woods with a laundry and dry cleaner owner who was playing a role of a chinese man. He was so aweful at it that it would make you laugh out loud. The two Afro American guys were just as funny. The actors of this 1940 film, were bad actors, but the story was so fake that it was hilarious. If you want a good laugh, this is the movie.",1029283200,2,564,3.9130434782608696
