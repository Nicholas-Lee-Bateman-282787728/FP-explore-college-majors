4500327,5,B004YJZDYQ,this movie is so great. it's not one of those crappy low budget communist era movies. the story and the battles are great. 5/5,1331596800,,126,4.291666666666667
4500328,5,B004YJZDYQ,"A very well achieved war movie on the relatively little known German siege on Brest Fortress in north central Russia (Byelorussia) during late June, 1941. Very well acted, the movie shows how the soldiers of the Russian battalion stationed at Brest attempted to stand over the German siege over several days. Drama is added as the fortress was home of wives and children of these soldiers, and by the fact that is told in first person by one of only survivors, a young military boy. The movie has very well achieved street battle scenes. Good attention is placed to details of Russian and German uniforms, as well as to fighter and bomber planes. Overall, a very good addition to war or war drama movie fans.

It seems to me that a few reviewers are a bit bothered and view this movie as a bit of communist propaganda. I strongly disagree to it. The movie clearly is centered on a historical episode that took place while the Soviet Union was a communist country, so what's the problem with that. In addition, Russians lost this battle, and Germans are depicted simply as an invading military force, without any evident political connotation.

My DVD copy is a release by G2 Pictures that comes with a Russian audio and English subtitles. It comes in a widescreen format and runs for 128 min (not the 138 min indicated on the back cover).",1330732800,3,1338,4.641350210970464

It was like watching a 30 year old movie when it came to storyline and sometimes background music. A the same time sets and charactersation was most interesting.

Fortress of War come out as a fully mature film and everything comes brilliantly together. The movie is full of characters in strong emotional situations, usually slightly undertoned giving the imagination free rein. The battle scenes are brutal and well made with even clever twist thrown in here and there. The film is about resistance and heroism in the face of danger.

Historically it is very interesting, as Defense of Brest Fortress is important to the Russian and White Russian character. True to life the Brest (Brest in White Russia not France) Fortress was hit by full force when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. Quickly surrounded the Germans had to fight to capture it 2 years before during the invasion of Poland and attempted to capture it this time by a Coup de main (A coup de main is a swift attack that relies on speed and surprise to accomplish its objectives in a single blow.) This failed and turned into a costly struggle. The Defense of Brest Fortrees became a symbol of Soviet resistance much like Tobruk for the British and Commonwealth.

For a war movie fan I give this film top marks and for others it is a good film as well for it is a story of human level as well.",1318118400,5,2045,6.168421052631579
4500331,5,B004YJZDYQ,"This Russian gem of a film starts with a young boy and how he plays for the Red Army marching band. He tells the story through the lives of those that lived and died through out the siege. It is set on June 22 1941 and the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Russians' under Comrade Stalin guidance had signed the Molotov Ribbentrov pact of non aggression. They had no orders to defend their borders, in fact the previous day; Russia had delivered vital war materials to the German regime.

Then they attacked with out warning and without a formal declaration of war. The Russians were neutered. The Brest Fortress was not really a fortress but an 18th Century fortress/garrison that had long since become obsolete. The men had their families stationed with them, kit was a sprawling Victorian base of operations that could never with stand a modern barrage, let alone the might of the Wermacht.

Once the attack begins the Russians are in disarray, but soon thanks to the Commissars, they get organised, but they have very few weapons and little ammunition. The Germans had already infiltrated their lines and cut off both power and water. They have no choice but to fight. Any attempt at a break out id met with German aggression. Once they start defending the Motherland they use everything, from chairs to barrels. This is a real war film, where hand to hand fighting is shown up close and personal.

It does not shrink from any of the realities of war and does not glorify anything - except for the human spirit. The cinematography is excellent; the acting is superb, especially from the younger members of the cast. Whilst they scavenge the German weapons and try anything to defend themselves they realise they are already out flanked. They are without food, without water and without hope - but they fight on.

This is truly an excellent film, I was constantly reminded of `Come and See', and it is that good. Russia continues to surprise, and Hollywood could learn a thing or two from this production. It has emotion, violence, drama and heart by the bucket load. This is one for all fans of war films, even the music is excellent - I can not recommend this highly enough, and it is one to buy- not rent as you will want to see it again, after you have got over your first viewing that is - ruddy brilliant!",1315612800,5,2319,4.621359223300971

[...]
together with my Grandfather, who mentioned to me, that he was fighting there as a german officer in a position as a translater. But that was all he wanted to tell me. I couldn't get another word out of him about the battle of the brest litovsk fortress. When my Grandfather passed away in 1969, all that he revealed to me, was, that he was at first working as a translater with a lieutenants rank, later leading a company of russian ROA volunteers. And that they where sometimes fighting partisans. The insistent bugger I am, I wanted to know more. But my Grandfather just didn't want to talk about it. After reading many books about ""operation barbarossa"" and seeing very few movies about that battle of brest litovsk, like ""am gruenen strand der spree"". Which was an excellent film, acurately portraying that battle from the german side, in one of the 5 episode films.
I found the russian version incredible interesting, well acted, with awesome CGI special effects, and confirming
what I've learned so far about the battle. I also liked the angle, as seen from the point of view of the young boy.
This way, a lot of details that would not show up in a documentary would reveal a very human aspect.",1312675200,12,1294,4.626086956521739

4500335,5,B004YJZDYQ,"I purchased this movie after previously seen it on line and really enjoyed the story line and the character development.  Despite the movie being subtitled in English it has a lot of detail and for those who are historians and weapons collectors you will see an array of weapons from the Mosin-Nagant Rifles - MN 91/30, SVT 40 (sniper rifles), TT33 Tokarev Pistols, and the devotion of duty that the Soviet Army had in one of the Great Patriotic War's battles.

The garrison is surprised by an attack which was expected, but unknown when, but hold out with out food and water for several days.  You will shootings, hand to hand combat with no limits on the violent graphic images of war and how up close and personal it can be.

If you like Russian cinema this is one movie you do not want to miss out on.  I really enjoy it and will definitely recommend it to anyone.  If you enjoyed 9th Company you will enjoy this movie.",1304726400,36,923,4.431952662721893

4500338,4,B004YJZDYQ,"The acting was touching. The best thing about this movie was the human drama.  For example, the scene where an injured soldier told his wife to try to escape and raise their children was tear-jerking.

The explosions in action scenes looked real and gripping. For instance, the scene in the first 20 minutes when the fortress was bombed by the German looked genuinely chaotic and terrifying.

4500346,5,B004YJZDYQ,"This is a good movie, by any standard. If you are interested in this subject or interested in getting something from the Russian point of view then you will like this movie. I have read some rather silly and uninformed reviews of this movie - some of which gave positive star ratings, but then slag it off as propaganda, etc.  I'll give these people the benefit of the doubt that they are not as familiar as I am with Soviet history, the Great Patriotic War or Russian culture in general, but this film can hardly be characterized as ""communist"" propaganda. Since this film is based on real events and real people each of the central characters are given a bit of an obit towards the end by the makers of the film. They do not fail to mention the repression suffered by one officer posthumously awarded the ""Hero of the Soviet Union"". As well they note the fact that the others received the award - not at the time, but many, many years later - post Stalin. For an American viewer that might not mean much, but to a Russian it speaks volumes. The heroism of these men in defending their fort, families and country being recognized with the order of ""Hero of the Soviet Union"" after Stalin's death is as good as saying ""Stalin"" and the Soviets threw these guys under the bus and failed to recognize them - we are making up for it now. Russians are not real show boaters or braggarts. They tend to be inscrutably subtle. That can be a little tough for some Americans to pick up on right away. Others criticized the happy scenes that opened the film - as if such happy scenes never existed in the Soviet Union, but again, if you know anything about the War or the culture at the time, you would understand that the film opens on the longest day of the year and the start of summer. It is traditionally a big family day, a picnic and party in the park kind of day - not only then in the Soviet Union, but even now in Russia. Those scenes ring absolutely true and having read many first person accounts and having spoken to many pensioners and veterans who were alive at the time - none of whom were commissars or apparatchiks - they all described similar scenes on that fateful day in their own lives. It was the day the war started. Others take the opportunity to use their review seemingly not to address the movie and the story itself, but as an occasion to review the sum total of the Soviet experience. Folks, it is movie about a group of soldiers overrun and surrounded on the first day of the war, coping with all the shock and unimaginable horrors that was the war in the East. It is not a treatise on the benefits and glories of the Soviet Union - and it doesn't come across that way either. Some people can't get off their soapbox for even two hours. The people who were trapped there and ultimately died there - sorry, there is no ""Saving Private Ryan"" ending - were heroes. In that moment, in those circumstances and context, in that small corner of that gigantic front and war - far, far away from the halls of power in Berlin or Moscow, London or Washington - be they a communist or simple soldier, a civilian or a child - they were the ones facing head on the horror of the Nazis, not some armchair wannabe general leaving his review here - and they died heroes. It is a powerful, powerful movie. Generally great performances throughout. Very human portrayals and not unidimensional characters. A normal person will be moved to tears by the close of the film. And it is a worthy and no doubt overdue testament to those people who died in those first terrible days of the war in the East.",1358726400,21,3598,4.38622754491018
4500347,5,B004YJZDYQ,The movie is about the first days of the German attack and you will sympathize easily for the commies over the fascists due to the unmercifulness of the nazi regime once surrender is on the table.,1358380800,2,196,4.472222222222222
4500348,5,B004YJZDYQ,"This movie truly is one of the greatest war films ever made (especially in regards to the Great Patriotic War). The historical accuracy is nearly unparalleled by other modern movies. A great amount of research and fact-checking was done to produce this. The special-effects are well done, and the overall look adds to the tone of it.

The story this movie tells is riveting and emotional, showing what it was truly like for the defenders of the fort following Operation Barbarossa. Specifically, by the end, you realize how much they had sacrificed to defend the fort, which wasn't even that much of an obstacle in the Nazis' path.

However, it is a Russian/Belorussian film, so they do not go the politically-correct route and show the invaders in too good of a light. That being said, it does actually show the real style of the attacking Fascists.

Overall, I would highly recommend this film, and unless you have strong convictions (whether Pro-Fascist/Anti-Soviet), you will enjoy this film.",1358035200,,996,4.9879518072289155
4500349,5,B004YJZDYQ,"Excellent movie.  This one really stands out for a Russian made WW2 movie.  There was some demonizing of the Germans, but its not that bad.  Reminded me of 55 days at Peking in some ways.  Last stand by a brave bunch of soldiers and civilians thrown into a conflict (WW2) suddenly.  Lots of action scenes.  Weapons and vehicles were mostly accurate as well as uniforms and weapons.  Glad I bought this one.  Of all the foreign made English subtitled movies I own, this is now my favorite one.  Price for what I got was well worth it in my opinion.  I wish all the newer made Russian WW2 movies were this good.",1355097600,2,609,4.357142857142857
4500350,5,B004YJZDYQ,"The movie depicts an episode of the first days of the Soviet resistance against the Nazis - the defence of the Brest Fortress.

Fully outdated as a defence point, it became a trap to almost 10,000 Soviet soldiers and boundary guards from several different units when the Germans attacked.

The reason for that should be sought in the Stalin's fear to provoke the war that eventually led to the orders that nowadays seem to be insane - and that cost to the Red Army a very many thousands of lives and enormous quantities of destroyed planes and ammunition.

22 June 1941, 2-30 Berlin time, the German offensive began. For the Brest Fortress, it turned out to be deadly shelling that within hours destroyed the majority of the heavy weapons and killed and wounded literally over a thousand of soldiers and non-combatants.
Still, almost half of the troops managed to escape - with heavy losses on all their way out. The other half, with hundreds of wounded and many civilians, stayed in the Fortress and defended it against the German strike units which penetrated into the Fortress at the very beginning of the fight. Outnumbered, severed into few pockets of resistance, with lack of everything from weapons to water and from food to medical help, the people of the Fortress fought like no one else.

The movie accurately shows the battle - from the Russian side. The main heroes are the actual people who fought in the Brest Fortress and their characters are very close to the reality (there are lots of books about this episode of the war). The portrait of the boy who appears to be in the centre of the action, is also based on a real character but includes some of the episodes of life of other children of the Fortress.

The sequence of events is also real - including the German's atrocities (like using the wounded Soviet soldiers and civilians and the medics as a human shield). For some, this may even be a drawback of the film: although it IS a strong action movie a substantial part of which is devoted to the fight (and as a result it does have a few minor inaccuracies), it is NOT packed with the Bond-style pop-corn action and hordes of enemies killed.

Actually, for some others,the above-said should be another reason to see the movie.

Some secondary characters are fictional (like the one of a truck driver - who is actually not the best part of the play).

Overall, a very fair and powerful movie about one of the most striking examples of the heroism and self-sacrifice of not a single man, but thousands, in the history.",1354492800,3,2539,4.639198218262806

4500352,1,B004YJZDYQ,"I do not think I got 1/2 way through this piece of Soviet Propaganda crap before I turned it off; it is actually unbearble.  The film begins, as a previous review states, in an idyllic Soviet Wonderland, where people eat icecreame, fish, watch movies, and make love.  Then, enter the EVIL Nazis!!!  Let the raping, murder and brutality begin.  I stuck this film in right after I finished watching Katyn.  I was hoping for a realistic, objective treatment of this opening battle for Army Group Centre.  That was not the case.  If you want to find out what really happended, read Paul Carrels' ""Hitler moves East"".  If you want to watch a really good Russian war film, buy the 9th Company.  One last word..this movie was dedicated to the ""Heros"" of Brest-Litovsk who died in the defense of the ""Motherland"". Brest was POLISH territory, which was absorbed into the Soviet Union by conquest, after the Russian invasion of Poland on 18 September, 1939.  The Russians took land streching from Smolensk to Brest, which was the demarkation line between them and the Germans once the campaign ended.",1352678400,10,1090,4.811827956989247
4500353,4,B004YJZDYQ,"A big budget Russian ww2 war movie. Great action sequences, and fine acting. Overall script and sequences well done. Basically a historical drama based on an actual defense of a Red Army fortress trapped behind German lines at the outset of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the USSR. The problem I have with this movie is the beginning and end ... at the beginning we have this idylic set of scenes of life in the fortress, all is peace and plenty with giggling sweathearts, kids playing, a band playing a concert, a communist utopia with no fear of the gulags, no denunciations, no poverty, no disease ... the whole thing is like a quaint town gala in 19th century midwest USA or the opening scenes of The North Star, that dopey US propaganda movie about our 'courageous soviet allies'. blah blah blah. It is completely out of joint with the realities of the era in the USSR under Stalin. At the end of the film after the fortress is taken by the Wehrmacht, the young boy who escapes thinks wistfully back in time, now an old war veteran many years later and believes all those of the Red Army who died at the fort are somewhere still alive... but how ? Isn't he thinking of an afterlife for them? a HEAVEN ? But wait, I thought communism was ATHEIST !!! they are therefore just DEAD !!! Oh well, who said Russian cinema was logical or truthful ! LOL ! but as movies go, it was very ENTERTAINING. Also, the Germans are once again depicted as keystone cops, falling down and behaving like their tactics are crap, which of course is nonsense, at this stage they were kicking red army ASS, esp since they do take the fort in the end, despite the heroics of the red army...
If you like to watch military fighting, good pyrotechnics and uniforms, good acting and good CGI, and historical drama roughly based on actual historical events, this one's a good romp. Just don't expect a documentary on the realities of life in Stalin's CCCP or the red army of that era. But the Russki's sure know how to blow stuff up on screen ! Good production values overall even if its short on the realities of communist rule and Wehrmacht abilities.",1350691200,2,2133,4.51421188630491
4500354,4,B004YJZDYQ,"This film is the best of the Russian made WW2 movies.  Other Russian made films of this period are typically propaganda movies of the brave Soviets standing up to the murderous Germans, but not this one.  It tells the tales of the first few days of combat in a fairly realistic way.  The material used is generally appropriate (Mosin Nagant rifles used by Soviets, 98K rifles by Germans) though if you have an eye for detail, you will notice that the Panzer MkIIIs are really BMPs made to look the part (bogies are wrong).  The CGI used for aircraft is typically inaccurate in terms of speed (they fly and buzz around like Star Wars TIE fighters).  Overall this is a worthwhile film.",1350604800,3,683,4.565573770491803

Superb cinematography, casting and realism pervade throughout the film. From the first moment the viewer enters the world of the defenders of the fortress and continues through it's brutal but inevitable climax. It portrays the insanity of aggression towards all participants and the destructive results. This film encapsulates the war and the Nazi advance into the Russian motherland. Technological achievement vs determination and endurance...perhaps the most important factors towards the realization of the ultimate Soviet victory. The acting and battle scenes could not be better...with the subtitled version it's a chance to brush up on your Russian!

8448485,5,B004YJZDYQ,"In the last half dozen years I've started watching more Russian-made WWII movies, and I must say, THIS movie is now officially the best single effort I've come across - this is an outstanding film!  The story is told through the perspective of a young Russian boy who was inside the famed Brest fortress and witnessed the fighting and siege first-hand, so the story is surprisingly accurate with far less Russian bravado than one generally gets in a Russian WWII movie.

The cinematography is superb, the early war Russian uniforms are spot-on perfect, and they did a great job of recreating some very authentic-looking Panzer III tanks for this film.  The acting is all extremely good, there's nothing that strikes you as ""silly"" or overly patriotic (very rare in Russian-made WWII movies) and most of the characters portrayed in the movie (from what I can tell) were actual Russian officers and soldiers who were at Brest in 1941.

If I had to point at a single Russian WWII movie as the best film yet, honestly, it would have to be this one - it really is that good.  Cannot recommend this one highly enough, it is a seriously great piece of work and there's absolutely nothing here I can find to be critical of - and that's rare!",1390348800,,1233,4.637614678899083
