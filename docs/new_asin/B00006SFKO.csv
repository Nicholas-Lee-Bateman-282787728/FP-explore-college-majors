I've gone through alot of trouble to keep a hold of this through several moves and storage units for years at a time, I LOVE THIS DVD! It is not only great when you are sober, but it is ESPECIALLY amazing on a whole other level when you are ""expanding your mind""..every single track is great, especially from track 6 and on, it gets amazing, especially if you are already a fan of hardcore like i am, or raving in general. Its great for a party in the background too, its amazing all the way around. I can't recommend this any more highly!! Literally had some of the best memories and times of my life, some super profound memories and moments of mine, to this dvd playing!! GET THIS! You will not regret it one bit <3",1270944000,,772,4.1879194630872485
7972962,5,B00006SFKO,"This is a rare find these days if you can find it. Its perfect for house partys. I had a friend borrow my copy to play behind the DJ on the big screen at a houseparty/rave. The visual effects are MIND BLOWING:) It has tracks from happy to be hardcore 1 threw 5 ""6 hadn't come out yet"" so it has a little mix of everything and yes SCott Brown has 6 tracks on the cd but Dj UFo also has a couple Dj Q-tex has a few tracks ""power of love 2001"" best song and visuals on the dvd. SO its just not Scott brown like a few other people said, And for all of you that like to lets say 'Get out their' nothing better too watch than this dvd while your takin those long 'trips' bottom line a MUST HAVE for anybody that is into the party scene what so ever",1243555200,,742,3.824675324675325
7972963,5,B00006SFKO,"I was looking for something to provide some background phychadelic-like video on a wall screen for a party.  The footage was perfect - we had a DJ and this just played in the background on the wall - non-descript, and fun - graphics were great.  Although we didn't play the sound for the party - i did  listen to the sound tracks and the music is very good - great dance music.  I'd reccomend this.",1168300800,,398,4.266666666666667

Good stuff!",1091750400,6,236,3.816326530612245
