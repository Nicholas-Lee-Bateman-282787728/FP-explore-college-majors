8407543,3,B003WV5C2A,"This is the third in the series and highlights the fact that BBQ is a global thing with many perspectives on how to cook the perfect meal on the grill.

Again this is a well presented series with quality dishes. Steven Rachlen explains things well and is still the best BBQ presenter on the planet.

This particular series is pricer than the others, which unless you are a serious BBQ enthausist, it may not be worth it. But for me it is as I enjoy expanding my knowledge on all things BBQ.",1369526400,,490,4.315217391304348

8407546,5,B003WV5C2A,"Quite good particularly for inspiration (DVD given as a present)- excellent recipes are usually also available on his website(s).  However I much prefer several of his cookbooks,in particular: Sauces, Rubs and Marinades, along with The Barbecue! Bible and Planet Barbecue.  We grade recipes in order to keep track of what we like and don't like - I'd say literally 95% are in the A- to A+ range.  His recipes seem to be exceptionally good.  Also note they can be adapted for broiling followed by baking (I did a lot of that throughout the winter).",1308268800,,547,4.787234042553192
