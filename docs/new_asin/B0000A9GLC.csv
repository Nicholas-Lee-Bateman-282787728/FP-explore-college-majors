1905250,5,B0000A9GLC,"MINER'S MASSACRE WAS A DIRECT-TO-VIDEO RELEASE WORTHY OF THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO FANS OF SLASHER FILMS.
A FEW SIMILAR MOVIES COME TO MIND WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT THIS MOVIE.
IN THE STYLE OF THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES AND IN THE VEIN OF MY BLOODY VALENTINE, THIS MOVIE DELIVERS.
IT FEATURES A CAST OF ALMOST ALL UNKNOWNS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JUST A FEW(KAREN VALENTINE AND JEFF CONAWAY).
THIS FILM IS QUITE VIOLENT AND FEATURES SOME GORE. ALSO, A BIT OF NUDITY.
IT IS SURE TO PLEASE HORROR FANS THAT APPRECIATE OLD-STYLE HORROR/SLASHER FILMS.
I ALSO RECOMMEND WRONG TURN AND CABIN FEVER IF YOU ENJOY THIS.
THEY ALL DELIVER THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF THRILLS AND CHILLS!
SO TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN LOW, SIT BACK, RELAX AND ENJOY!!!",1067040000,,740,4.7
1905251,1,B0000A9GLC,"What do you get when you cross the creeper, jason voorhees, and madman marz? The 49er that's what. It so obvious that this film was gonna be bad, so it should've been gorier. Th 49er is obviously a rip-off of the creeper from jeepers creepers. He kills like jason and madman marz, and has that ghost story that madman marz did. But this ""film"" doesn't get off easy. It is totally void of anything remotely scary (duh) but it is a film which you and your buds can sit down and make fun of it. Acting=CRUD! SCORE=CRUD! DIRECTOR=CRUD! SCRIPT=CRUD! and Miner's Massacre=Pure cheezy fun. Rent it.",1065225600,,591,4.584905660377358
1905252,2,B0000A9GLC,"The Miner's Gold should stay buried, and so should this DVD! From beginning to end, this DVD was a disapointment. I chose to give it 2 stars, although it is more deserving of a 1.5. The idea itself put me in mind of a mummy film- disturb the treasure, and awaken an evil curse. First, the film seemed to ""bright"" to fit the horror genre. Second, the film score was not at all ominous enough to invoke any type of fearful anticipation (Except for the end of the movie!) Third, the actors looked more like teen-show actors than actors of a horror film. The only good spot in the film was a 20 second strip dance given by a well-built red head. My recommendation...this one should go back to the dust.",1064534400,,698,4.33587786259542
1905253,1,B0000A9GLC,This movie is a travesty. the acting is so bad it makes me sick and it has absolutely no thrills or chills. anybody who gives this higher than a one star needs to have their testicles removed surgically. It tries to copy friday the 13th and it fails miserably. any of those movies are 10 times better than this piece of sh--. I don't recommend this to anybody not even the people i hate. its terrible!!!!,1239321600,,404,4.328947368421052
1905254,4,B0000A9GLC,"The movie is so bad, it's hilarious!  The actors(?) are comatose, the story line has been done to death, it's not at all suspenseful and the ending is pathetic.  This is a must see.  Really, don't pass this one up.",1171497600,,214,4.3
1905255,5,B0000A9GLC,"They've gone back to the Halloween/Friday the 13th-style slasher movies, where the killer is barely seen throughout the first 2/3 of the movie even in the scenes involving him killing people, the victims' bodies basically disappearing, leaving no sign that anything happened, and so on. As such, this is better than most modern slashers.

Also, Vernon Wells is very good at playing a villain... too bad he's only in this for about five minutes though.",1169251200,3,451,5.013333333333334
1905256,4,B0000A9GLC,"Some guy finds some gold in an old mine, then he calls his friends to come and help him dig it up.  And old miner, the Miner Forty-Niner, comes back to life and kills the guy.  When the rest of the kids arrive, he goes after them as well.  The characters aren't bad, they're total cliches, but played with enthusiasm.  The plot sort of drags here and there with pointless subplots, but hey, they had to pad out the run time somehow.

Overall, I give it four stars because it's better than most of the garbage out there and I sort of liked it.  Nothing great though - not even close.  Okay for a boring night when there's nothing on TV if you're a fan of slashers.",1153526400,2,663,4.173228346456693
1905257,2,B0000A9GLC,"You know you've made it in cheesy B-cinema whenever your flick gets picked up by the SciFi channel.  ""Miner's Massacre"" is one of those chosen few.  SciFi flicks are of two kinds:  1)decent flicks with small budgets and even smaller stars or 2)just flat out awful.  ""Miner's Massacre"" falls into this second group.  It's the tale of a bunch of nubile twentysomethings who head off into the mountains to seek out an old mine that's full of gold.  Of course, by finding the gold they unleash the fury of Jeremiah Stone, claim jumper, rapist, cannibal, and all-around nasty dude.  He's awakened from his evil slumber whenever the brother of one of the main characters finds his stash and sends half of a map to his sister to let her know that there is in fact gold in them thar hills.  When the sister arrives, with boyfriend and others in tow, the hackin' and slashin' kicks off big time.

I have to admit that there are some pretty decents kills in this flick.  The miner is actually a pretty mean looking fellow and the actor who portrays him does a decent job in the role.  The special effects aren't that shabby either.

The main complaint I have with this film is that the actors in it are just horrible.  There's a geeky dude named Axl, who loses his girlfriend right at the beginning of this flick when she sees him holding hands with a local named Eve.  Sure, Eve's pretty, but she has a horrible ""redneck"" accent that completely destroys her character.  The rest of the gang are typical of films such as these.  They all overact, wear skimpy clothes, and seem to abandon all sense of logic in making decisions.

Of course, there are the token cameos by little known or forgotten actors such as Jeff Conaway, Karen Black, and character actor Martin Kove.

If you decide to watch this flick, be prepared to get a typical hacker B-flick with only minimal repeat viewing potential.  As stated before, the mad miner is a really cool idea and he has some wonderful kills, but it's just not enough to save this snoozer.",1151020800,,2019,4.542936288088643
1905258,2,B0000A9GLC,"I've never been the first to review a movie!! I rented this movie being a horror fan and any movie with the word massacre in the title is a movie for me! This movie isn't all that bad. It centers around 3 couples who go to a ghost town to try to find gold in a old mine. They end up bringing to life a dead miner who now takes revenge on anyone who tries to take ""his"" gold. Some good scenes in this movie. Overall, not a bad movie to rent, it's worth the $4 !!!!",1141171200,2,463,3.783505154639175
1905259,3,B0000A9GLC,"Unlike most straight to DVD movies, this was at least not shot with a camcorder. Though Jerimaiah Stone will never be as popular as Jason Voorhees or Freddy Kruger, he does have an interesting story and background.

Seems old Jerimiah survived the Donner party by eating his own wife and child. After that he became a crazed murderer, rapist, and claim jumper. So maybe ol' Satan had a special place in his black heart for him.

A group of young adults go to Suttersville with a map. They discover the gold, release the curse and the killing ensues. That's about the gist of it. The characters are everyday people which adds a little realism to this caper.

Eve was the best looking chick, but she got a pickaxe top the gut. other kills include....

A shovel to the throat through a windshield

A chain and hook hanging

A decapitaion scene with pretty good 'dying head' effects

A burning camero and driver

A lady being set on fire who jumps in the lake (survives?)

No nudity, which sucks for a slasher flick, but good none the less.",1106352000,3,1036,4.526881720430108
1905260,1,B0000A9GLC,"""Miner's Massacre,"" a.k.a. ""The Curse of the Forty-Niner,"" is one of those films that sounds great on paper but causes your nose to turn up in execution. In an effort to cover all the bases in the slasher genre, to grind out the absolute last bit of originality in a cinematic rubric long tottering on the brink of utter exhaustion, the filmmakers behind ""Miner's Massacre"" decided the time had come to make a picture involving a crazed, resurrected gold prospector. Well, why not? Why not resurrect a deceased gold miner and have him prey on a group of young airheads? After all, we've got a guy that victimizes children in dreams, a hockey masked maniac, a killer with a Halloween mask, and numerous enigmatic psychos whose stalk and slash activities revolve around every major and minor holiday on the calendar. I'm continually amazed at the number of low budget slasher films I see on the shelf at the local video store, and can only conclude that somebody keeps making them because I keep renting them. Sorry about that. Perhaps if I quit watching this dreck I could save millions of us one horrible viewing experience after another. I hesitate to even review this film on the off chance that my effort will inspire even one person to take this film seriously. Here goes, anyway.

""Miner's Massacre"" starts when a young guy discovers gold in the old mining regions of California. Unfortunately, his discovery of a nugget awakens the spirit of Jeremiah Stone (Vernon Wells), a world-class jerk when he lived back in the nineteenth century and an even bigger brute as a manic monster now. Before the youngster bites the dust as a result of Stone's tender mercies, he sends the nugget and a crude map to his sister Claire (Carrie Bradec). Now Claire, her boyfriend, and her friends aren't the sharpest tacks on the wall, but they do understand the implications involved in finding golden treasures. So Claire and her associates hop in their cars and head out to find the gold hinted at in the correspondence from her sibling. I won't go into great detail about the dolts along for the ride since we've all seen these types before in countless horror movies, but Axl (Steve Wastell) deserves special attention. Think of a low rent Steve Buscemi, add a grating, irritating attitude, and you've got a good idea of what to expect from the Axl character. More important is the number of instantly recognizable B actors sprinkled throughout the film. Karen Black, John Phillip Law, Martin Kove, and Jeff Conaway all turn up in minor roles.

The kiddies hardly step out of their cars before the casualties start to mount up. Axl's mouthy girlfriend is the first to wave bye bye when she leaves in a huff after her boyfriend befriends local gal Eve (Alexandra Ford). There are the usual warnings from the locals about danger in the area, particularly from Sheriff Murphy (Law) and Eve's Aunt Nelly (Black), but the gold seekers continue to look around for riches anyway. And they find them, chests and buckets overflowing with gold, tucked away in an old mining shaft. Of course, taking away Jeremiah Stone's gold will have lasting consequences of a most painful sort. Only by putting every piece of gold back in the mine will these young adults have any hope of escaping with their lives. Predictably, a few of the characters don't think much about this idea, but that's expected--they'll pay for their obstinacy with their lives before the final credits roll because unbridled greed always equals a death sentence in these films. The movie's conclusion fails to deliver anything we haven't seen done better in countless other horror pictures. There is an amusing flashback sequence explaining how Jeremiah Stone's curse came about, but this short series of scenes comes far too late to arrest the movie's downward spiral.

I'm finding it difficult to say anything good about the film. Certainly, seeing Karen Black screech her way through the role of Aunt Nelly provides a measure of enjoyment, but that's about all the movie has going for it. Martin Kove, Jeff Conaway, and even John Phillip Law only turn up for a few minutes before moving on to what one hopes are greener pastures. About ten or twenty minutes into the film I began to hope that the gore would save the day, a hope that turned out to be illusory. Stone carves up a few of the kids, and then collects their blood in a bucket, but nothing really happens beyond that. I thought that a film as derivative as ""Miner's Massacre"" would try to ramp up the violence in an effort to stand above the crowd of B grade slasher films--guess again. It's all rather tame and uninteresting. The same applies to the acting (mediocre) and the pace (plodding).

Extras on the DVD consist of three trailers for ""Snake Island,"" ""Killer Buzz,"" and ""Global Effect""--three films that look no better than this movie. ""Miner's Massacre"" might slightly appeal to fans of low budget horror films, or completists that simply must see as much in the horror genre as they possibly can. For everyone else, I can think of a huge list of films preferable to this one. I recommend anything in the ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" or even the ""Leprechaun"" franchise in place of this film. The lack of significant gore, ineffective cameos from faded stars, sloppy performances, and all around cheesiness of ""Miner's Massacre"" make this DVD a dangerous journey indeed. Watch at your own risk.",1093132800,,5431,4.805347593582888
1905261,4,B0000A9GLC,"Despite it's awkward title and slow start, ""Miner's Massacre"" turns out to be quite an interesting take on the slasher genre.  Here we have a group of friends(who look wayyyyy to old to pass as teenagers) searching for treasure in an old mine.  The locals repeatedly warn them not to go near the mine for good reason.  They are soon stalked and slaughtered by a re-animated 1800's-era miner who's trying to protect his gold.
What ""Miner's Massacre"" lacks in originality, it makes up for in it's humorous script and memorable characters(particularly the Steve Buscemi lookalike Axl).  The young actors are attractive and mostly appealing, and the cast is rounded out by some seasoned vets(John Philip Law, Karen Black, Richard Lynch, Jeff Conaway, and Martin Kove).
""Miner's Massacre"" is a satisfying blend of horror, action, and comedy.  It may not be the best of it's genre, but it's hard not to like this movie.",1083888000,3,913,4.9411764705882355
7996817,1,B0000A9GLC,"I'll never forget the day I walked into Hollywood Video, looking for something to rent & I came across this movie when it 1st came out in the New Release section & I got the last copy. It was known as Miner's Massacre then, not Curse Of The Forty-Niner. Who came up with that stupid name? It sounds like something off Scooby Doo. Miner's Massacre sounds so much better. Anywayz..... I couldn't wait to get home & pop it in the DVD player. After watching it at the time I remember enjoying every moment of it. Watching it now, it's not as good as I remembered. I wonder what was it that I enjoyed so much about it?! There were times where I tried hard not to laugh & times where I just couldn't help myself that it felt like a comedy movie & not a horror flick. There were times where I was just bored. Most of the time I just wondered why did I enjoy it so much the very 1st time I watched it. Miner's Massacre (I refuse to call it Curse Of The Forty-Niner) is worth watching at least once especially if you LOVE BAD movies as much as I do or you're looking for a late night horror flick, a cheezy late night horror flick",1488412800,,1121,4.1

7996821,3,B0000A9GLC,"An all too familiar premise, a group of kids head for a cabin in the woods, the last known whereabouts of a brother to one of the kids.  Too late, he's already gone, a victim of the Curse of the Forty-Niner.  He is, in fact, the person who unleashed this maniac by stealing some of the Forty-Niner's gold.  What follows is par for the course, a lot of off screen killings and a few semi-notable stars: Karen Black as the resident crazy lady, John Phillip Law as the local yokel sheriff, Martin Kove as the guy with a phone in his cabin, Jeff Conaway as a distraught flashback, and Richard Lynch as an enterprising geezer willing to sell fake posters and give directions to the lost.  The remainder of the cast, the so-called stars, are barely camera ready.  Most seem to think acting is all about excessive exaggerations and pronounced quirks.
Supposedly an exercise in greed (""Greed was in the air......thick as blood!""), instead, this movie is all about recycling bad ideas, bad dialog, bad acting.  It would have had to work a lot harder than this just to be second rate.  Unexceptional in every regard, the greatest offense here is that they don't do enough with the opportunity they were given to create a potential iconic villain/evil entity.

Three couples who, quite frankly, seem to hate each other, go on a camping trip in search of some lost gold. What they don't know about is the curse of the Forty-Niner, Jeremiah Stone. If someone steals his gold, his ghost comes back to kill them. Wait. ""I Want Me Gold!"" This is cribbed straight from the pages of Leprechaun. Anyway, they steal the gold, get hunted, and find out from a hysterical, overwrought Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) that they need to return it to stop the curse. A few things amused me. Jeremiah bites off his own finger for no reason. A fender bender turns into a massive two car explosion. And Aunt Nelly has apparently never heard of stop, drop, and roll.",1357603200,,754,4.392857142857143

7996824,4,B0000A9GLC,"No really known actors except one who had a small part in it, but this is a pretty fun slasher flick.  It isn't like a Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street but in its own pretty good.

Just about some friends meeting up to an abandoned mine/cave who heard about gold in there.  So they wanted to get rich.  Catch is, if you take any of it out of the mine then he comes to kill you.  They are in like a ghost like town also and run into a local and her mom who tries to warn and help them.

So you basic slash and gore movie but not a bad one.  Acting wasn't all that bad and fun to watch late at night.",1342656000,,602,3.768

7996826,2,B0000A9GLC,"Here we are at the 12th Octoberfest horror review and decided to go with the true Sid fashion of horrific B found no earlier then 1:00 am on a movie channel. This type of flick, as terrible as it may be, really screams the origin of what we love. And that is finding very obscure low budget films late at night to have a great laugh over. Despite it bringing our minds back to the great times in life Miner's Massacre was almost a complete waste. Now it wasn't a one star effort being that the zombie type revenge bent miner was pretty cool looking. Other then that with a few laughs it's something you will never have on a priority list.

Being the intelligent reader you are you can pretty much sum up where this one's going just from the title. We have a group of very unlikeable friends that discover a heap of gold, probably the chocolate kind found at a dollar store, inside of an old mine. Once they decide to remove the gold from the spot the spirit/zombie miner comes out looking to tear sh** up. His revenge is something of epic proportions in the laugh department. Some kills are so ridiculous you just can't help but enjoy them for being so thought provoking. Really just your average run of the mill idiot kill fest but still earned a couple stars to do it's laugh factor. If you're looking for a legit horror then look much further then this. As far as Sid stands, one view was enough. We most likely would have enjoyed it about the same even as 13 year old kids.",1255392000,,1477,4.31294964028777
