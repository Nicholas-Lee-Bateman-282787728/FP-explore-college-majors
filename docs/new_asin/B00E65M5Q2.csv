8601768,4,B00E65M5Q2,"An interesting collection of films from the 30s 50s and 60s.
Some history of London in those decades. A nice bit of video from the 30s 50s and 60s. Shows some interesting facets of London citizenry and their habits and hobbies.",1507766400,2,227,4.560975609756097

8601770,4,B00E65M5Q2,It was pretty interesting. I did notice when talking about the protests in Britain over the Cuban Missile Crisis they said it was Oct. 1963 and that was wrong. It actually took place in Oct. 1962.,1446076800,,196,4.472222222222222

8601773,5,B00E65M5Q2,"We've all seen newsreel footage presented for amusement's sake with the original idiotic voiceover in place - fun for about 3 minutes.  Here's what this is: A bunch of high-quality newsreel footage of mid-20th century London, re-cut and re-sequenced to tell a reasonably coherent story about London life in the 30s, 50s, and 60s.  It's been given a fairly sophisticated new narration - at about the level of a good high school history class.  There are lots of fascinating things to look at, plus you actually learn something.  This had no reviews when I bought it so I crossed my fingers.  I'd class it as ""money well spent.""",1403913600,6,626,4.7592592592592595
