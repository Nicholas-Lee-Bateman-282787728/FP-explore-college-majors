2500447,4,B000E6ES9E,"Young Gabe Burton (Josh Hutcherson of ""Zathura"") makes it clear from the opening moments of ""Little Manhattan"" that being in love when you are 10 (and three quarters) years old is enough to drive you to tears.  He lives somewhere in the east 70s of Manhattan with his parents, Adam (Bradley Whitford) and Leslie (Cynthia Nixon), who are in the process of getting a divorce.  However, the peculiarities of the law somehow require them to continue living together until the divorce is finalized (Clearly Mr. Bumble was right: the law is an ass).  This makes things awkward for Gabe when his dad greets his mother's dates at the door, but that is not as bad as answering the phone and having everybody think you are your mother.  However, that is not as bad as falling in love with Rosemary (Charlie Ray, in his film debut).

Gabe thought he believed that girls could give you cooties and that this was a bad thing.  But then when he starts taking karate lessons and fate pairs him up with Rosemary as his partner.  She is better than he is, but he does not care.  Gabe provides a voice over narration to help explain what he is going through, which is not surprising first time director Mark Levin cuts his eye-teeth working on ""The Wonder Years.""  But it also turns out to be a big help because clearly what Gabe is saying and what he is thinking are entirely different things.  Unfortunately, nobody is providing a voice over for Rosemary, and Gabe cannot tell if she likes him or what.  While practicing karate together at his apartment he actually gets the upper hand and his mind is screaming and him to go on and kiss the girl, but the body will not apply.

This 2005 film tries to milk the pathos of puppy love for all that it is worth and ""Little Manhattan"" is one of those movies that gives the kids the space to play this out by keeping the parents in the distance.  There a few pointed looks and causal comments by Gabe's parents, but they do stay out of the way and Rosemary's parents do not blink an eye at her inviting a boy along on the family's night at a fancy club.  This is a movie that saves its most significant moments for after the inevitable first kiss, and which delights in violating our expectations, especially after making sure they do in a particular direction.

The end of this movie trades off one step backwards with one step forward, so do not be surprised when what happens rings more true more in terms of realism than romanticism.  It is just that screenwriter Jennifer Flackett (who co-wrote ""Wimbledon"" and ""Madeline"" with Levin, but went solo on this film), goes a bit too far in setting up a moment of undeniable confirmation for Gabe as to what Rosemary thinks about him, and then having her back off of that when the kids finally get around to both of them saying what they are (or are not) thinking.  Yes, I was surprised by the ending, but the fact that I do not think the movie really played fair with us to set up the surprise takes away from the moment.  Instead of it being poignant, I found it did not ring true, which is not what you want for the emotional payoff to a film.  At least Gabe knows which part of the double-ending is the happy part.

Ultimate, this is a movie about kids that adults will enjoy a lot more, because they can look back at the pain of first love with not only nostalgia but a certain amount of glee since it is not happening to them (my wife said I was getting more enjoyment out of this film than I should, so it is pretty clear which one of us has the most pre-teen scars on the heart).  There are some cute moments when the landscape of Manhattan takes on our role and starts letting Gabe know in no uncertain terms what he should do, and except for the fake crying jag that bookends the beginning of the film and the final act, Hutcherson does a good job of keeping things real.  As for Ray, she seems like a real kid took, and you will probably spend a lot of time trying to decide who she reminds you of, once it is clear to you that she has never done any acting before (really).",1144195200,3,4062,4.352317880794702
2500448,5,B000E6ES9E,"This was perhaps the cutest movie I've ever seen in my life.  It was so sweet and so funny, and really something to be treasured.  The movie was so well done without being cheesy.  And the casting was perfect!  I've had this pre-ordered for 2 months already- can't wait for it to arrive!",1144195200,3,287,4.3584905660377355
2500449,5,B000E6ES9E,"OK, finally the wait was finally over and Australian audiences got to see the movie... In MARCH!

I went with my two girlfriends to see it last Sunday afternoon. I had read the reviews where people had said the dialog was too old for the Gabe... I disagree... considering he is an only child of what can be assumed to be professional parents - in this world of instant and constant media, a 11 year old in that situation could well be versed in what was going on around him.

I went with the expectation to enjoy the movie... but I was really quite suprised that it twanged at my heart strings right at the end...  I'm not ashamed to admit, I got a little misty eyed when Adam told his son he had cleared out some of the spare room... it was so sweet.

Loved it, can't wait to get my copy!",1143676800,15,789,4.137254901960785
2500450,5,B000E6ES9E,"I've seen this movie in the threater. I watched it with my boyfriend. It was funny and sweet. It brings back the memory of how we first felt in love and really know what love is. I wouldn't say the acting was great, but the story really bring back all the memories and I cried because the littel boy broke his heart because Rosemary think she's too young and she's not ready for love. It's true that she's young, but to Gabe, she'll always be his first love. A great way to bring back the memory that we once forgot.",1142899200,6,516,4.17
2500451,5,B000E6ES9E,"This is the best movie i've ever seen! It's very romantic. There are lots of exciting scenes in this movie. It's about a Boy who falls in love with his classmate, and finds out for himself what love is when you're still young. I really recommend this great movie to you because it will make you feel more young and fall in love.",1142380800,,328,4.222222222222222
2500452,5,B000E6ES9E,"I also saw this one on a flight.  They started it while we were still on the runway and due to weather conditions we were still on the runway when it ended.  Amazingly, everyone still seemed happy and content because the movie not only passed the time but was so sweet, touching and accurate about the trials of being a normal kid.  This speaks volumes about the movie and how it can appeal to just about everybody.  I'm so sad to see it isn't coming out until April.  Since I saw it in December I have been telling everyone how great it is and will be one of the first to purchase it come April.  I can't wait!",1139616000,6,611,4.135593220338983
2500453,5,B000E6ES9E,"This was one of my favorite films of 2005 (another, ""Zathura"", also starred Josh Hutcherson) and deserves a widescreen presentation. I want to slap all the film studios. Somehow they got it in their heads that if the cast features anyone under 14, the film must be released full-frame. But this movie was made for adults, not for children. It deserves to be seen as its excellent director intended--WIDESCREEN!",1138752000,3,410,4.956521739130435
2500454,3,B000E6ES9E,"It will come as no surprise that first-time feature filmmaker Mark Levin was a producer and writer of the beloved early-1990's TV series, ""The Wonder Years"". The same sort of observational humor and cheeky voiceover narration is present in this small, relatively unremarkable 2005 film about the pangs of first love for a bright, sports-challenged ten-year old named Gabe, who lives in the Upper West Side with his parents, who are going through a slow-moving divorce. In the midst of his somewhat dysfunctional existence, Gabe's object of desire is Rosemary, a girl he has known since kindergarten but who suddenly becomes attractive as they partner in a karate class.

The problem is that the script by Jennifer Flackett (Levin's wife) makes Gabe sound far more like an adult sitcom character than a yearning pre-adolescent, and the resulting contrivance deters the credibility of the storyline. The demi-budding romance between Gabe and Rosemary has moments of charm, especially as they travel into the forbidden territory of the West Village to find his father an apartment. Predictable elements lead the story to its inevitable ending, but it's all good-natured and almost too facile for the lack of resulting drama.

The cast is serviceable. Josh Hutcherson lends a precocious intelligence to Gabe, and Charlie Ray makes Gabe's obsession understandable as Rosemary. Cynthia Nixon (Miranda on ""Sex in the City"") and Bradley Whitford (Josh Lyman on ""The West Wing"") lend unobtrusive support with their scant screen time as Gabe's parents. I frankly never heard of this movie before catching it on a United flight in November, but the 84 minutes sputter by relatively quickly with Tim Orr's crisp cinematography capturing a Manhattan that I thought existed only in Nora Ephron movies. The film also provides a nice excuse to resuscitate the 1970 Edison Lighthouse chestnut, ""Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)"".",1138147200,4,1915,5.254901960784314
2500455,4,B000E6ES9E,"I have just seen this movie on an airplane.  I was wonderful.  It was so accurate about young love and the feelings it brought up, that I was instantly transported back to my childhood!  It was funny and touching, and made me forget my surroundings for the full 2 hours!  It made me cry in some spots, and laugh out loud in others.  All in all I recommend this movie for all who want to take a  trip back to their childhood.  The lead actor and actress are wonderful, and I expect them to have a very sucessful career.  The lead actress is beautiful, and will be a stunning young woman very soon.",1137801600,35,596,4.212389380530974
2500525,5,B000E6ES9E,"Probably my favorite movie by far. It just makes you smile and remember about your childhood, how simple yet the little things were the ones that made the difference. I stumble upon this movie by chance but I'm surprised it doesn't get more recognition.

He can't seem to pull the trigger, even during Karate practice when he has Rosemary pinned to the floor and Gabe's fantasy karate idol appears urging him to kiss her.  Still nothing.  When Gabe finally does gather the nerve to kiss the girl, his technique leaves a lot to be desired.  IT's just a quick peck on the lips.  What's the point of that?

2500853,5,B000E6ES9E,"I absolutely LOVED this very atypical but extremely beautiful romantic comedy. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Gabe Burton (Josh Hutcherson) is almost eleven and lives in Manhattan with his soon-to-be-divorced parents. He always thought that his life, albeit far from perfect, was not so bad after all - but then, very recently, he met an old acquaintance of his, Rosemary Telesco (Charlie Ray) a girl couple of months older than him, whom he lost from sight since they were together in the kindergarten. And at that moment, his life all of a sudden became much, much more interesting, complicated and painful - because he fell victim to this wonderfully cruel life event, which has for name THE FIRST LOVE...

I will not say anything more here about the plot - let's just say that the scenario is brilliant, very intelligent and without one weakness. Telling a story about love between two 11-years old children, a love driven entirely and exclusively by beating of two hearts, without hormones and pheromones having yet anything to say, is a very delicate, even perilous exercice - but the scenario accomplishes its routine at a 10-note level from all the judges and avoids masterly all the snares and booby traps (pun very much intentional...). Be however aware, that it is a bittersweet treat - because the first love is usually a very pure, beautiful, delicious but also a most cruel thing...

This film, although some adults obviously appear in it too, is carried almost totally by the two child actors.

Charlie Ray (whose real name is Charlotte Ray Rosenberg) was at that time 13 and she did a great job, in what was her first - and as it turned also the last, at least as of July 2013 - appearance on the silver screen. An important detail here - as many girls at ages 10-13, she is actually taller than boys of her age... And that certainly makes her even more intimidating for the boy whose heart she, unwillingly and unknowingly, stole for ever...

Josh Hutcherson, was also 13 years old, is simply AMAZING, but this could be expected, as he was already at this time a more experienced child actor, with already six films behind him (including ""Polar Express"") and with the contract to star in ""Zathura"" already signed. As we all know he would later impress in the amazing ""Bridge to Terabithia"", before making it into adult stardom in ""Hunger Games"" franchise. But still, I believe that his part in ""Little Manhattan"" was possibly the HARDEST and the most succesfully performed of them all - and once you see this film, I think you will agree with me.

So bottom line, this is an excellent, WONDERFUL film, which I absolutely LOVED. Recommended to absolutely everybody - you will laugh, you will cry and you will certainly one day see it another time. Enjoy!",1373241600,,2799,4.760824742268041

He is a big Sci-Fi fan, and in his short career, has been in Journey To The Center of The Earth, Bridge To Terabithia, and he has also recently landed the lead in the upcoming Hunger Games trilogy. Little Manhattan was however the film that got him started. It's a simple story about a ten year old boy and his first love. Basically, I saw it as Sex In The City from the adolescent males point of view. (It even features Cynthia Nixon and Willie Garson.) The film was cute, but it should have been so much better. The kids were acting way way WAY too mature for ten year olds. I was a ten year old boy once and nothing like THAT ever crossed my mind. The parts are written for much older kids, nevertheless, Hutcherson and Charlie Ray both do a fantastic job with their respective roles. This should have been a comedy about the awkwardness of first love, instead, it's just a cute story. It's enjoyable, but they could have done so much more with this story and this cast.",1361577600,,1046,4.314720812182741

2500916,4,B000E6ES9E,"Little MANhattan (get it?) is a very simple story of an 11 year old boy named Gabe from New York City who falls in love with the ""3rd prettiest"" girl in his 5th grade class, named Rosemary. Gabe first notices Rosemary at school but it is not until he takes Karate lessons where he gets to become sparring partners with Rosemary, thus becoming closer friends and a significant part of her life. The best part of the story is that it takes us back into our minds as children as we have dealt with the same confusion, and general worry and neediness of crushing on someone as a child as Gabe does. While Rosemary is quite ""mysterious"" and confident, she is also just a normal kid herself, but whose more insecure character does not become better revealed until the movie's final moments.

The story takes us plenty into Gabe's thoughts, such as ""what does this mean? Is she mad at me? What could she be thinking?"" He struggles to find time and answers from Rosemary, meanwhile he does contain a certain confidence in himself despite his insecurities, which gives his character a charming and likable appeal. Gabe's parents are played by veteran B list actors Cynthia Nixon and Bradley Whitford (who's more C list really), who are going through a divorce, thus paralleling Gabe's own self-questioning relationship with Rosemary. While Gabe does have a great relationship with his parents, he desires the tight-knit relationship that Rosemary's parents have. Now, while the general story regarding Gabe's feelings are really the highlight of the movie (a man vs. self conflict approach throughout), it may seem to some just as beneficial for us to get into Rosemary's head as well. Yet if this was done the film would lose that mystery aspect we all could identify with in our remembrances of childhood crushes. Therefore, Gabe's character does not only resonate with men but can also with women.

The on-going divorce and general separation of Gabe's parents does play out well, but we do not see any real plot twists or exciting and tension filled drama many would expect, except for one fight Gabe gets into with Rosemary that is quickly settled. Viewers may be dissappointed with the general lack of emotionally involved conflict, but instead be treated to a sweet film they will just quietly smile a lot at in nostalgia. The film also does go into somewhat far-fetched territory. Real 5th graders should not be made to feel guilty if they do not have the guts to take a fellow 5th grade friend into the subway and into a more rough area of the city all by themselves. No, but in this film, for dramatic and charm purposes, we have two young children who are in the middle of New York City and are given so much alone time in wide open spaces that in real life any parents would probably have been arrested and charged with child neglect and abandonment by social services. Sure, Gabe's mom does get worried and punishes Gabe for going into another burough with Rosemary at one point, but realistically, children that age in 2011 would never even attempt such a feat by themselves. Interestingly enough, his punishment is quickly lifted as we see Gabe doing his normal everyday routine with Rosemary not even 3 minutes after he was supposedly ""punished"" and grounded. This of course convenient just to move the plot along.

The movie ends charmingly and sweetly anyway. So we have a generally cute movie most people would enjoy if there was a quiet night with nothing much else to do. I for one caught this on cable one day with nothing else to do, but after watching the film, it would not be one I would intentionally go out and pay for, or make others watch with me. It's good and cute, performances are charming and well acted, dialogue is believable and all is generally good enough for 4 out of 5 stars... but it's ultimately forgetable.",1320278400,,3842,4.705794947994057

The upper west side of Manhattan, actually, is mostly populated by
middle-upper and middle-middle income people.  And this film shows people who are just that: not wealthy enough to ignore life's problems, and not so poor they are over-whelmed by them.

The girl, Rosemary, (played by CHARLIE RAY), has parents slightly better off than the boy's, Gabe's, (JOSH HUTCHERSON's) -- her parents are the producers of a daytime soap opera, modeled after a real-life soap opera of the '80s, ""Santa Barbara"").  The two have several ""dates"", of sorts, (the type 11 and 12 year olds usually have...including one which is a dinner-date with her parents).  They meet a neighbourhood bully, and have ""angst"".  All through this movie, is a quirky, ""The Wonder Years""-style narration by Gabe,
If you liked ""The Wonder Years"", you will definitely like -- or maybe even love -- this movie.

To me, the highlight of this DVD is towards the beginning of ""Chapter 8"".  As Gabe and Rosemary traverse a bicycle lane near a New York highway, one can just catch a fleeting glimpse of what looks to be the old Elmhurst Gas Tanks.  The Elmhurst Gas Tanks were HUGE, cylindrical structures, by which many people, (including myself), used to gauge our distances, going to and from Manhattan to the other boroughs.  Sadly, the Elmhurst Gas Tanks were torn down several years back -- and the glimpse of them in this film is fleeting, (VERY fleeting), at best....but I found myself repeating this sequence, over and over, just to get that glimpse!

The Rosemary-Gabe story is sweet, cute, sometimes surprising, sometimes agonizing -- and always, always very real.  It is a satisfying movie, with NO four-letter-words, and NO dysfunctional families, (excepting the fact that Gabe's parents are going through a rather amicable divorce.)  It is credibly, (and often, winningly), acted, by all concerned.  You want all the best for all the characters here -- especially Gabe.  If you like ""nice"" movies, that are involving, sweet, and touching, (as well as at times being
exciting -- like that fight with the bully), and warm, (as when Gabe's father finds out where Gabe has been the day Gabe didn't tell his dad where he was going), you'll truly enjoy this movie.  It brings back much of the certainty, the uncertainty, and the sweetness of childhood.  I'm glad a sequel was made of this movie.

The more he is around Rosemary the more enchanted he becomes and he admires her superior karate skills.  The story takes place against the backdrop of Manhattan and the two explore parts of the city together.

The story is told from Gabe's perspective and encompasses all the agonies of youth trying to decipher deep meanings from every gesture and word.  He is on a perpetual see-saw of emotion.  She is a mature young girl, likes him and is honest about her feelings.

As a child, he's particularly hard on himself because there's nothing much to do, he doesn't even have an addiction, a girl much taller than him becomes the object of his teenage affection. I think what makes this film stand out from the rest is how the little boy is alone despite having parents. The parents never quite come to his rescue and he realizes most things on his own, good or bad. I liked the film a lot because it had little apology and was extremely funny. It's always a rage when a young man worries about himself and how he looks and how much he thinks. That little young man seldom dies in a man, with age comes a surety.

2501161,5,B000E6ES9E,"It's very rare to find a romantic comedy that's appropriate for kids, and still poignant and funny enough for adults.  Most have jokes that are either funny but too crude for children, or fall flat; romance that's either too mushy for men and boys or not powerful enough for women.  But this story from the point of view of a 10-year old boy, Gabe (Josh Hutcherson), falling head-over-heels in love with a slightly older girl, hits the mark so right on target with a clear, honest script, the writer director team (husband and wife Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett) deserve an award for marksmanship if not an Oscar.  One of my favorite lines is when Gabe tells the elevator operator: ""Just some . . . date ... with some ... girl.""  But that attempt at nonchalance is an exception from most of his narration, which is ernestly romantic and anguished.

The only really similar film I can think of is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucas-1986/dp/B00007JMDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucas (1986)</a>&nbsp;(starring Corey Haim) and Little Manhattan is comparable in quality as well as theme, but significantly different in plot and setting.  Hutcherson's acting is outstanding for his age, a feat repeated in his performance in the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/B00005JPL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>.  That film also has some similarities:  both deal with a relationship between a young boy and girl, and both have a few little special effects shots showing the children's imagination; so if you liked Terabithia but prefer something funnier & less sad, this is your ticket.  It's pleasant, funny and endearing throughout, and though it might make some chicks cry at some points, it's not because anybody dies or anything.  The young heros cynical view of love may be the only thing that saves him (maybe something better saves him, you'll have to watch to find out).

This is one of those movies to always keep handy for rainy days when you can't agree on what to watch. Oh, yeah, and the end credits features one of my favorite songs, ""Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes).""

To hear the tale of Gabe (a 10-year old Manhattanite) and his view on love was entertaining and thought-provoking.  Gabe is cynical about love as a witness to the deterioration of his parents' marriage but cannot stop himself from surrendering his heart to his charming classmate, Rosemary Talesco.  The script is smart enough for parents and sweet enough for kids, with emotion and intelligence in every scene.  We just watched it again today on a long drive.  I got to listen to it without the benefit of the lovely cinematography and found myself ever more appreciative of the tight dialogue.",1183766400,3,697,4.7272727272727275
2501164,5,B000E6ES9E,"Little Manhattan brought back a slew of memories for me also.  This movie brought to the fore the feelings that I had had (as a pre-teen & teen), but just didn't have the voice to express my feelings to the females with whom I was enamored.  Now, I didn't cry as our young man did in the DVD, but I did understand (and could relate).

I wouldn't relive those days even if you paid me!  I would recommend this flick to all pre-teen and teen young men as course 101 in the art of expressing one's feelings to females - but the fact is, that with the emotion that we call love, there is no 'art' to it.  If you wear your heart on your sleeve, chances are it's going to be broken - be ready - if you can.

To anyone that reads this - have your pre-teen and teenage sons watch this.  If they say, ""That will never happen to me!"", just smile at them and say, ""If you say so..."" and leave it at that!!",1180828800,5,894,3.9887640449438204

times, but the ending was a bit surprising and very touching.  It stars

the boy from The Bridge To Terabithia, but no big name actors.  It received good reviews, but had little to draw in the average viewer.

This, in summary, is a film for everyone, and a delightful one at that.",1168560000,5,322,4.295081967213115
2501239,5,B000E6ES9E,"I found this movie to be a delightful account of an early first love that developes between two Manhattan 11 year olds: Gabe, portrayed by Josh Hutcherson, and Rosemary, portrayed by Charlie Ray. In the voice over that runs throughout the film, Gabe seems rather pessimitic about love, and is convinced that all love ends. This is understandable as he is living in a household with parents in a failing marriage, and in the midst of a slow-motion divorce; his mother has even started dating other men. Therefore, I feel that this belief of Gabe's is not really meant to be a defense of divorce, as one reviewer here contended, but simply the view of an 11 year old boy who is living in a family headed straight for, as he tells it, the Jerry Springer Show.

Yet, inspite of what he thinks he knows about love, he finds himself utterly swept away one day while hanging out with his ""karate friend"" Rosemary. He sees her in a beautiful dress, and realizes for the first time what an ""amazing creature"" she is. Previously he was indifferent about Rosemary, and girls in general, but now he finds that he wants to spend as much time with her as possible, and eventually gets to the point where he wants to kiss her before she leaves to go to camp for 6 weeks. But she is a total mystery to him, as he looks for clues about what she might be thinking and feeling with regard to him. There are several points where the two stand gazing at each other, and you can see growing fondness they have for each other, yet Gabe falters in his uncertainty, which only makes him more determined than ever. ""I will kiss her before she gets on that bus to Maine; I will, I will, I will!"" Also, another guy appears on the scene, whom Gabe considers a romantic rival, which does nothing to help his anxiety level. Instead of talking to Rosemary about his feelings, however, he keeps it all in...""I needed more, and more pain.""
He finally gets the break he's looking for when Rosemary calls him to invite him on a night out with her and her parents at a local club to hear the jazz singer, Loston Harris. This convinces him of her affections toward him and gives him the confidence to ""move to the next level"" which means, to him, holding her hand. He is thrilled when she seems to like the hand holding, but later when he kisses her, she seemed stunned and bewildered, so he is once again plunged into uncertainty. He endlessly reveiws the kiss scene over and over in his mind, trying to figure her out, but to no avail. But rather than calling her to talk to her about it, he avoids her until the next karate class, where he obsessively looks for clues from her about her feelings, but again, she seems inscrutable. Later, he has a heart to heart talk with his dad about girls...""why are they the way they are...why does all love have to end?"" His father then tells him about what happened between his (Gabe's) mom and himself, how they just stopped talking about things, and over time grew further and further apart. This is a wonderfully insightful moment in the film, and it is not lost on Gabe, as he soon figures out what he has to do: TALK to Rosemary, and tell her what he feels. What happens next is one of the most beautiful scenes in the film when he actually does this. However, he feels that things are at an end for them because Rosemary is going to camp. I would interject here that that would not necessarily be the case in reality; relationships don't necessarily end simply because someone goes on an extended vacation. There's no reason that Rosemary wouldn't write him while she's away, or call him when she returns. But to an 11 year old boy, perhaps, this is not yet realized. So, in the midst of the confirmation of his belief that all love ends, he discovers that his father also acted on his own insight and had a little talk with Gabe's mother which seemed to substantially clear the air. At the end of the story, we see a ray of hope for Gabe, and for us, that perhaps love doesn't have to end after all.

I found this movies to be very a charming and thought provoking look at not only first love, but love at any age. This experiences of Gabe and Rosemary will ring familiar to anyone old enough to have had the experience. It was beautifully acted by everyone, and Charlie Ray was delightful in what was here her first appearance in a feature film. It was also wonderful to see Manhattan portrayed in such a positive light. I have never been there, but movies like this make me want to visit.",1163980800,6,4501,4.402160864345738

However, what I didn't like was the decription of the first love, it was too true and applies to me in every aspect.  It brought back the good and bad memories.  The movie also tells the audience that love doesn't last forever, and I don't think that's something people would want to hear...  I can explain further about the bad of the movie, but it will probably ruin the ending...

2501246,1,B000E6ES9E,"Few movies make me as angry as this one from a traditional values viewpoint.  In short, it is a clever defense of divorce dressed up as young puppy love.  The clear message is that love does not last.  Try telling that to both my wife's and my parents, who were married well over fifty years; and my wife's father and my mother spent the last year or two of their spouse's life lovingly caring for a partner who was nearly to completely helpless.  (Our marriage is approaching forty years.)  In this movie, Gabe's parents are separated, but still living in the same apartment, with his mother dating other men!  Is this movie also an advocate of 'open marriage?'

The only reason I didn't give it an 'F' is that there are some cute situations experienced in puppy love, although I would say the inner thoughts they provoked would not occur to most kids until they are at least three to five years older than these kids.  Another thing that saved the movie from an 'F' is that Gabe's dad recognized that his marriage was on the rocks because they let too many little offenses slide - and grow - instead of talking them out, which would have kept their marriage together.  The script tries to save itself by having Gabe's family having dinner together as the closing credits start, but it is too little too late to change the overall message.

This is very much a preteen girl's movie, but hardly one I'd want my daughters to watch unless I wanted them to get the idea that true, lifetime love is a hopeless ideal.",1152489600,9,1512,4.485401459854015

2501318,5,B000E6ES9E,"This movie was a blind-buy in my case, and I have to say, I wasn't in the least bit dissapointed.

The basis of the story is young ""ten-and-three-quarters"" year old Gabe who falls in love with Rosemary.

The movie is wonderful.  It's a love story, but it's innocent and bittersweet, which gives it it's charm.  The movie is one to which everyone can relate to.  Rosemary and Gabe are like our inner child, and New York City as the setting is beautiful, it gives off the ""magical place where anything can happen"" aura.

The cast is also incredible.

Everything fits and comes together almost perfectly.  I especially liked the fact that they made Gabe the narrator and that he doesn't come off as corny, but more as a cynic as far as love and girls go (which would be understandable for his age).  The movie never loses pace and I didn't once look at my watch, which is a huge plus.

Overall, it's a movie I really enjoyed watching and that I'd highly recommend.",1149897600,5,961,4.471264367816092

2501320,3,B000E6ES9E,"Sometimes sappy works and it works in Little Manhattan.  The story follows the main character, Gabe, on his rollercoaster ride (forgive the cliche, but it fits here) that is his first experience with ""falling in love.""

It's narrated by Gabe so it has a ""Wonder Years"" feel to it.  Both Gabe and the object of his desire, Rosemary -- who is cute, sweet, smart, multi-talented, and innocent -- are charming, likeable characters.  Indeed, both are not like many real 10/11 year olds that most of us have met.

The movie is extremely sentimental, something like a ""chick flick"" for pre-teens.  Nevertheless, it captured my attention as a 34 year old man because I remember experiencing, with various pre-teen crushes of my own, some of the emotions Gabe experiences.  There's a beauty to the innocent, non-sexual ""love"" one feels at that age, and that's what the film's really about.

The movie is not entirely bright and sunny.  In the midst of his whirlwind romance with Rosemary, Gabe has to live with the dysfunction of divorcing parents sharing the same apartment.  Because that has some prominence in the film, it may raise questions from younger children that parents would rather not confront.  If you don't want to have to explain to your kids why some people get divorced, why they fall out of love, etc., you might want to skip this movie until your kids are a little older.  It's not even in the same universe of sadness and dysfunction as something like The Squid and the Whale, but it does raise these issues.  Fair warning.",1146614400,8,1535,4.768939393939394

2501322,5,B000E6ES9E,"One of the genuine surprises to be released in 2005 was Little Manhattan, a charming, precious (without overdoing it) Woody Allen-esque ode to New York City for the elementary school set. It asks that age old question do girls mature faster than boys and proceeds to tell the story of a relationship between a boy and girl from the his point-of-view. The film was given very limited release in theatres and is now out on DVD where it will hopefully find a wider audience.

Most of the action takes place on the Upper West Side and for anyone who's lived there they will recognize familiar landmarks like the Beacon Theater, the Planetarium and Riverside Park. A lot of credit goes to filmmakers Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett for staying true to the geography of the city and shooting entirely on location as they provide a wonderful travelogue of the lesser known side of Broadway.

Little Manhattan doesn't sugarcoat the messiness of relationships and the sometimes bittersweet nature of love no matter what the age. Even when things don't work out, hopefully you learn from the experience and are a better person for having gone through it. Most kid's movies are either too cutesy or try too hard to make them little J.D. Salinger-esque adults. This film gets it just right, treading the line between both, never having too much of one and always maintaining a balance.

There is an audio commentary by director Mark Levin and screenwriter Jennifer Flackett. They consciously wrote their movie in a way that it had to be shot in New York City and could not be doubled in Toronto as is commonly done. Levin and Flackett acknowledge Woody Allen as an obvious influence on their movie, citing Annie Hall specifically, and also When Harry Met Sally. This is a pleasant track as they take us through various aspects of their feature film debut.

There are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Levin and Flackett. In a nice scene, Gabe has a vision of people on the street spontaneously breaking into a song and dance number that should have stayed in.

""Helmet Interview."" Levin and Flackett ran into interference from the studio that feared a backlash from Gabe riding around on his scooter without a helmet and so to appease them, they filmed all the scooter scenes with and without the helmet and this extra presents the helmet footage.

""Sheep Meadow Segment"" takes us through the sequence where sheep magically appear in Central Park. Using live sheep proved problematic so they used CGI to create a herd that they could control. This featurette shows the various stages of the sequence.

""From Scout to Screen"" takes us through the scouting of locations for several sequences to the final cut that is in the film.

Finally, there is the theatrical trailer.",1145491200,37,2773,4.8354430379746836
2501323,4,B000E6ES9E,"I originally saw this movie in theatres with three friends in Union Square. I myself was quite apprehensive about the idea of watching a movie about young love, having found many movies in the past dealing with it to be unsatisfying and full of child actors who never fully crossed over from someone acting to being an actor. What makes this movie successful is that the performances by Josh Hutcherson and Charlie Ray effectively capture the spirit of the well-written script. Anyone can remember their first kiss or the first time you held someone's hand, but to capture those moments on the big screen in such a way that anyone can say ""I remember that"" is quite an accomplishment. The two-week love story between these two middle schoolers has a way of transporting anyone back to that awkward time in his or her life when everything was so important and when everything was life or death. The movie can also be viewed as an ode to the upper west side, as the cinematography does a phenomenal job of showcasing my favorite area of New York. That being said, the movie did have its problems - the dialogue oscillated between the type of WB over-cerebral stuff you see on television and the dialogue you would expect between a 10 and an 11 year old. As a friend put it - Gabe's internal monologue sounds like that of an old spinnster. But overall, it's a highly entertaining date movie that you and a loved one can enjoy, something that will bring you back to a time in your life when love was full of firsts.",1144454400,5,1511,4.538461538461538
