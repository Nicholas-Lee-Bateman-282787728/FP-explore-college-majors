2007987,4,B0001K5GOO,"The second season of Law and Order runs at a nicely slower pace than today's version, which allows for more acting and arguably a more fulfilling show.  As far as the DVD, the transfer is far better than the first season but bonus features are still disappointing.
Law and Order's frequent plot reversals started off as an attempt to avoid lawsuits (change a few plot lines to avoid libel) but is now a cornerstone of the series.  As in season 1, however, season 2 has slightly less complicated plot lines that allow for more development.  The overall pace is thus a nice shift; Chris Noth and Paul Sorvino have longer conversations with witnesses than the standard confirm time and location grilling.  Less plot drama allows for more reality too; one note is the courtroom sessions in general actually make an attempt to follow true trial rules on testimony, and giving Steven Hill more lines than ""make the deal"" is good to watch.  Guest stars like William Macy, Nick Turturro, and Jerry Orbach (as an attorney pouring his first cup of L&O coffee meeting with Stone as opposing counsel!) make the watching-for-future stars aspect of the early years fun.
As far as subject, where season 1 had Dick Wolf being able to pick and choose from how many years of New York crime, season 2 seems to have more current events.  Still, some very good episodes on things like blackmail, divorce, stalking a star, and other crimes from the early 90s that are still relevant today.  Not limiting the crime to murder (part of the cost of the spinoffs) also helps.  Besides the nicely retro hair of Robinette, you almost get a sense of nostalgia watching people with their early 90s complaints - the economy of that era stinking, crime waves ripping through previously good neighborhoods, and cops without cell phones and laptops pulling over to use the payphone.
The quality of the transfer is a lot better than the first year where flecking was a major problem, even though Universal has crowded 8 episodes onto each DVD.  Bonus features, however, cost this a star.  There's a nice 30 minute movie on the first three seasons of Law and Order with every major actor (except Hill) from that era of the series showing up to discuss it.  There are certainly interesting tidbits, like the tension among the cast, George Dzundza and Sorvino discussing why they left, Noth floating the idea of himself as the veteran cop rather than Orbach, and some good cracks about how present and former cast got off paying tickets at times.  However, there is absolutely no commentary from directors or writers during the episodes, or for that matter from other parties that might be interesting (like real law enforcement types comparing the cases they were based on to the episode) that could have easily been accomplished without too much cost and effort.  (For that matter, any commentary on the second season rather than a retrospective on the first three would have been a lot more appropriate).  At least there's no ad for a new Law and Order game as in the season 1 DVD, but Universal could do a lot better on something that you can see in reruns constantly.
Still, very much worth having for the L&O fan, and for those who aren't big current L&O fans a pretty good way to be converted.",1085184000,7,3261,4.71830985915493
2007988,4,B0001K5GOO,"The second season of ""Law & Order"" marked the beginning of the ""revolving door"" with regards to the cast.  The very first departure is prominently featured in the very first episode: Det. Max Greevy (George Dzundza) is killed.  Enter Det. Logan's (Chris Noth) newest partner: Det. Phil Cerreta played by the dominating Paul Sorvino.  The chemistry is different between the two officers, but it works well, perhaps even a little better than what previously existed.
Returning once again are the other members of the ensemble cast including: Michael Moriarty as Ben Stone, Richard Brooks as Paul Robinette, Steven Hill as Adam Schiff, Dann Florek as Donald Cragen, and as mentioned above Chris Noth as Mike Logan.  Reruns on most of the cable channels feature more recent episodes.  It is nice to be able to go further back in time to see the early episodes that defined L&O as a remarkable series that would continue for 14 seasons and counting!
Many of these episodes are ""ripped from the headlines"", though not all.  This DVD features fresh new interviews from cast members such as: Paul Sorvino, Chris Noth, and Jerry Orbach (who would join the cast next season, but appears for the first time this season).  The packaging is somewhat different.  On the exterior, it appears very much the same, though the box is reduced in size.  Inside, instead of 6 discs with 4 episodes per disc, there are 3 discs with 8 episodes per disc front and back.  I guess that feature helps save space.  Also of note, the artwork beautifully featured on the discs of the first season boxset are not on these 3 discs.  They bare no artwork at all.
If you're a ""Law & Order"" fan, this boxset is a must.  And the interviews with cast members (I won't spoil the details) definitely make it worth the purchase price.  So, sit back and watch some of your favorite early moments in the series that made it the smash hit that it is today!",1083715200,65,1912,4.66865671641791

2007991,4,B0001K5GOO,"I never really connected with Max Greevey(George Dzundza), and though it was a not-so noble end for him, Law and Order seemed to take a stronger direction in season two.  Michael Moriarty grew into the character of Stone more completely, and though Paul Sorvino was a very good role model, mentor for Mike Logan's(Chris Noth) troubled, on the edge persona, his brief stay with the series didn't give him a chance to grow.  What I really noticed in year two, was that the storytelling style really came together, the stories themselves were stronger, and the forced melodrama we often saw from supporting roles in year one, started to gel as rea, believable drama.  I really became hooked on the series after seasons two and three.  Great television, well worth owning! Jerry Orbach for Prez!",1082505600,,791,4.880597014925373

The budget was bigger so the episodes were produced in better lighting and were acted in more settings.  The core characters continued to develop, yet they were not larger than the surroundings or each other.  Ben Stone, Paul Robinette, and Adam Schiff raise great questions of social issues as they prepare for trial.  Lt. Cragen leads his detectives, Logan and new member Cerretta, admirably through a sea of speculation and instinct.  It was nice to see Paul Sorvino play a good guy again.  His character wasn't unlike George Dzundza's character from season one, but his acting experience led to a better product. I enjoyed this season more than the first because you could see the actors were becoming comfortable in their roles, even as they addressed heady issues.

It has a great premise , the first 30 minutes of the show focusing on the cops investigating a crime and the second half focuses on the prosecutors trying to convict the criminal . The fact that the heroes don't always win , as the cases can end with verdicts of both guilty and not guilty as well as hung juries and plea deals , just makes the show more enjoyable and realistic .

2008201,4,B0001K5GOO,"This review is for the Amazon Instant Video version, a terrific bargain at $14.99 for 22 episodes. The photography is less grainy than Season 1, the color sharper. I don't know if that's a technical issue or a deliberate change of technique from the gritty version of the first season. George Dzundza, the affable but somewhat dogmatic detective Max Greevey, is replaced by Paul Sorvino, a highly distinguished actor who yet lacks enough presence, so the partnership with Chris Noth, who plays the hotheaded detective Mike Logan, is less compelling. There are fewer ""ripped from the headlines"" story lines, but the plots, as always, are tightly knit with some real surprises. Interestingly, some of the endings are not what the viewer would want, and leave a feeling of being roiled up instead of satisfied. This edgy approach is very good and prevents a devotee from becoming complacent. You really never know whether good will triumph. The casting is as good as ever, and it's fun to see actors show up who will later reappear, either as mature versions of the same character (a lawyer who in later years appears in the series as a judge) or a totally different role. Steven Hill as the head of the D.A.'s office is predictably irascible, Michael Moriarty is a determined prosecutor, and Dann Florek is the same harried Captain who, a decade later, will reappear as the seasoned head of the Law & Order: SVU squad. Plots usually involve murder, but there are a few exceptions. There is a great emphasis on acting rather than special effects. In fact, there are practically no special effects, which is a refreshing change from current series which lean too heavily on high technology. All of these episodes have been rerun endlessly on various tv stations, but I thought the series was worth buying and have not been sorry I did so. There is no need to watch them in order. They're almost like potato chips...bet you can't watch just one!",1366416000,,1940,4.811377245508982

2008203,5,B0001K5GOO,"The show that almost didn't get picked up, almost didn't make it past the first season comes back for a second. But one cast member does not. In the season opener is probably one of the most powerful in the history of the franchise. During an investigation, Sergeant Max Greevey is murdered outside his home in front of his wife and kid and so Detective Logan gets a new partner. Sergeant Phil Cerreta. Another family man like Greevey, but Cerreta was a sharp-dressing Italian-American. Most of the topics that come out of the episodes are something we still deal with today. Rape on a college campus, a teacher having an affair with one of her students, a homeless man committing murder, a police officer crossing the line, stalking a celebrity and of course, gun violence among children. Logan and Cerreta's partnership is a lot like that with Logan and Greevey. Cerreta is the conservative family man and Logan is the liberal lady's man. Robinette is seen a little bit more in the 27th than in season 1, mostly explaining the law to the detectives (i.e the audience). Also introduced this season is Carolyn McCormick as Dr. Elizabeth Olivet, the recurring psychiatrist in the Law & Order universe. Jerry Orbach makes his very first appearance on the show about a year before he returns as a regular. This season is pure gold. One of the best seasons of Law & Order and the first to be nominated for an Emmy in outstanding as well as the first take one home as well.

Most of the episodes in this season are compelling--but I did miss Greevey.
I found one inaccuracy so frustrating though.  The episode where the child's body had been discovered after missing for 31 years had the child wearing a ""Kennedy for President"" button.  The election was in 1960 and the child had been missing since October 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile crisis.  Plus I believe this season was filmed around 1990, so if he was missing since 1962 that would have been 28 years...

2008232,4,B0001K5GOO,"The second season of the wildly successful ""Law & Order"" franchise is much different than the first.  Due to sponsors pulling out due to the program's content during the first season, the show severely toned down the dialogue and storylines for the second season.  Also, George Dzundza quit after the first season.  His character Max Greevey is killed by a hitman in the first episode (an uncredited actor played Greevey, the actor's face is never shown).  Paul Sorvino would replace Dzundza and while the chemistry between him and Chris Noth is fine, it's not as good as Noth and Dzundza's.  Plus to me, Sorvino doesn't really look like a cop.  The rest of the cast returns for the second season.  The L&O franchise's notorious ""double dipping"" starts this season as William H. Macy is back playing a different character than he did in Season One.  All in all, while this season isn't the home run that the first season was, it's still very good and a worthwhile add to your DVD library.",1189468800,2,988,4.703488372093023
2008233,4,B0001K5GOO,Early Law & Order episodes had many cast changes for various reasons.  Moriarity remains my favorite  though.  I always liked his film work and he is able to convey personality even when spouting procedural dialog.  Chris Noth also energizes the show with his 'big' personality.  What a mistake to fire him.  At least he had the satisfaction of getting a role that lead to bigger fame.  It's also interesting to compare the earlier Logan with the new one on the current L&O CI.  Recently the show has sufferered from generic characters and mediocre acting.  Watch the early seasons to see how riveting the show once was.,1189296000,,620,4.773584905660377
2008247,4,B0001K5GOO,"The second year of this marvelous series unfortunately is not as good as many of the others; the cast changes apparently come through in the production and acting, as evidenced by the interviews in the special features section.

However, the series continued to tackle sensitive and controversial subjects, and its cast is still a great ensemble.  The episodes this season seemed a little less suspenseful and talky.  The replacement of George Dzundza with Paul Sorvino also seemed to hurt.  While Sorvino is a superb actor, he never really seemed to fit in with the rest of them, and Steven Hill's Schiff was a little more annoying in this season.  But suffice to say, LAW AND ORDER changed the face of television in the early nineties and this season is still worth a look.",1170979200,,775,4.796992481203008
2008248,5,B0001K5GOO,"Season 2 of Law and Order saw the first departure of one of the main characters. The series was originally set to film in Los Angeles, but when creator Dick Wolf won his fight to shoot it in New York, actor George Dzundza did not want to relocate his family there, and this led to Dzundza leaving the show. Thus Dzunda's character, Max Greevey, is murdered at the beginning of the first episode of the season, ""Confession"", an episode that deals much more with the main characters' personal lives than is typical. For example, this is the only episode in which we actually see Greevey's wife. It also deals with the effect that the murder has on Greevey's partner, Mike Logan. This episode is the first appearance of Dr. Elizabeth Olivet, a clinical psychiatrist who performs consultation work for the 27th Police Precinct and District Attorney's office in Manhattan. In this case, she is working as a grief counselor and helping Logan deal with his partner's death. Her's is a recurring role that makes guest appearances until 1997. This episode is also the first appearance of Logan's new partner, Phil Cerrata, played by veteran actor Paul Sorvino.

Because of sponsors pulling support due to the controversial subjects tackled in the first season, the network suits got involved and demanded that the show be toned down. Thus the heated discussions on topical subjects that so commonly occurred between the various cast members during the first year's episodes and made for great dialogue were largely eliminated. Instead, the ""ripped from the headline"" format became much more commonly used. Often, starting in this season, you'll see a particular episode that is clearly borrowed from a prominent murder case. However, the outcome of the case is often different than what actually occurred in the case from which the script was borrowed. To quote the show's creator Dick Wolf - ""We take the headline, not the body copy, because the first half of the show is supposed to be a murder mystery and the second half is usually a moral mystery...it's not supposed to be the actual case"".

Among the more interesting guest appearances is Jerry Orbach as a defense attorney in ""The Wages of Love"". Jerry Orbach goes on to play wise-cracking detective Lenny Briscoe from the middle of season three until the end of season 14. ""Aria"" is the first appearance of Tovah Feldshuh as high-powered defense attorney Danielle Melnick. Melnick is a recurring character throughout the series, doggedly devoted to defending her clients to the point that 11 years later she is willing to go to jail for her principles and is shot by friends of the client she is trying to defend.

The stand-out episodes include ""Vengeance"", in which an ex-con who is doing the medical billing for a gynecologist uses his access to patients' personal data to pick out his next murder/rape victim. D.A. Ben Stone not only has to fight the ex-con's wife who is giving him an alibi, believing that her husband is being accused because of his past, he has to fight the murdered girl's parents who are trying to have the accused extradited to Connecticut, based on a stretch of the law, because at the time Connecticut had the death penalty and New York did not. In an episode that is prototypical of D.A. Ben Stone's desire to make new law, ""Sisters of Mercy"" is the case of a troubled young woman who has an affair with the director of the home for recovering addicts in which she is living because the director says that if she doesn't she will be put out on the street. Stone and Robinette go for first degree rape, a charge that requires them to prove a direct threat of physical violence. Stone argues that since expulsion would have forced the girl back onto the street where she probably would have been killed, the threat to expel constituted a threat of violence. Although everyone, including his boss Adam Schiff, tells Stone that the judge will set aside the verdict because he won't share Ben's enthusiasm for making new law, Stone proceeds and wins.

The season finale, ""Working Stiff"", is one of those rare episodes in which D.A. Adam Schiff gets more than a few lines, and we really get some insight into his character. A powerful businessman is found murdered, and at first it looks like the murderer is an elderly cancer-striken union member whose pension and health insurance were gutted by the businessman's corporate dealings. The union member, played by Eli Wallach, does not deny the allegations and wants to represent himself at trial just so he can make public all the things the victim did to the other union members. When the case against him falls apart, further investigation reveals that the businessman was about to be indicted by the Justice Department, and that this knowledge was leaked to powerful people who stood to be damaged by it, among them Dwight Corcoran, a former governor of New York. Schiff and Corcoran are old friends, but this does not stop Schiff from making the final necessary connection between his old friend and the murder. Hill's portrayal of Schiff is subtle yet brilliant in this episode. There is also a parallel drawn between the union member and Corcoran - they are both destined to meet a slow and lonely death albeit on the opposite sides of justice. If this episode had been made in 2002 instead of 1992, you would swear that it was ""ripped from the headlines"" of the Enron scandal.

This second year of Law and Order just goes to show that the early years of the show hold up over time and are still essential viewing. Highly recommended.",1143158400,26,5564,4.791666666666667

2008250,5,B0001K5GOO,"As season two of Law & Order opens, Detective Mike Logan (Chris Noth) finds himself assigned a new partner in Detective Cerreta (Paul Sorvino) in the wake of the murder of his old partner Greevy (George Dzundza).  From that point on, this is when the revolving door began to turn for the ensemble cast of Law & Order, even though the rest of season one's cast returns here.  Michael Moriarty's and Richard Brooks' DA team are still the best duo in the history of the show (say whatever you want about longtime vet Sam Waterston, Moriarty will always be superior), and Sorvino and Noth are excellent together.  The characters are given more depth, and the stories are more intense; containing that ""ripped from the headlines"" feel that the show would gain notariety for.  The late Jerry Orbach, who would become the face of the series from season three onwards, appears here as a super slick defense attorney, and his guest spot alone is worth giving this a look for alone.  All in all, season two of Law & Order only proves further that the early seasons of the series were undoubtadly the best, and now maybe Universal will finally get around to releasing season three on DVD.",1108512000,8,1177,4.666666666666667

This is genuine quality TV, and i hope with all my heart that the current trend of, well, crappiness will end soon, very very soon.

2008252,4,B0001K5GOO,"Season One gave us a show of unique creativity and presentation.  I would not call it slow in rhythm.  It just took its time.  With this MTV age, viewers probably preferred a little more speed of pace in the stories.

Season Two starts that.  The plots move faster, more twists happen, and the scenes switch quicker. Even the dialogue snaps off with more urgency.  This all sets up Seaons 3 and 4 which are my favorites.

I really liked Paul Sorvino.  I think he did an outstanding job worthy of his veteran acting resume by stepping into the shoes of George Dzundza.

I predict that Dennis Farina will do a fine job too when he replaces my favorite cop (Jerry Orbach) for Season 15. (Farina is a former Chicago cop by the way in real life)",1094860800,8,740,4.382352941176471
2008253,5,B0001K5GOO,"What a neat feeling it is to watch these older episodes and to experience the days when Law & Order was original and unique.  The format of the program has never changed in the 14 years the show has been on the air.  The first half of the program is dedicated to the police investigation (usually a murder.)  The second half was dedicated to the prosecution of the criminals involved.  Many fans of the early years like myself appreciate the subtle characterizations that the writers and actors brought to their parts.  That kind of authenticity is lacking in today's clich-ridden scripts with cardboard characters.

The best episode is, ""Confession,"" in which Mike Logan (Chris Noth) crosses the line after his partner from the first season is murdered.  Logan's struggle through the grieving process does not detract from the show's format, but only enhances it as Logan meets his new partner, Phil Ceretta (Paul Sorvino.)  Other standout episodes include, ""God Bless the child,"" ""Heaven,"" ""Vengeance,"" and ""The Fertile Fields.""  Its strange to see Jerry Orbach playing a slick defense lawyer in, ""The Wages of Love,"" a year before he would become the show's corner-stone character, Lenny Briscoe.  Some of the content was watered down a bit after advertisers bucked the idea of hot-button story lines that were common in season one.  Still, the material is gritty and realistic and the writing feels fresh.

The bonus documentary will appeal to old-school fans like myself.  It includes interviews with Chris Noth, Michael Moriarty, George Dzundza, Dan Florek, Richard Brooks, Paul Sorvino and Jerry Orbach.  Its neat to get inside of their heads a bit, though it is sometimes sad when you see the shape that Mr. Moriarty is in now.

The disks now contain eight episodes each (four per side.)  This doesn't seem to cut down on picture quality much and the audio is still better quality than what you find on television.  If you want to see Law & Order long before it was just another tired cop/lawyer franchise, buy these DVD's.",1094256000,17,2031,4.926470588235294
2008254,3,B0001K5GOO,"I'm glad to see that Season 14 is coming out now because I would have hated to wait for it if all the seasons came out in turn.  I do not intend to buy any season before Season 5 because the cast of the first few seasons does not interest me.  First of all, there are no women.  Secondly, I do not care for Michael Moriarty and Richard Brooks; give me Sam Waterston and his lovely assistants.  Steven Hill and Chris Noth are good, but Paul Sorvino is no Jerry Orbach and Dann Florek doesn't hold a candle to S. Epatha Merkeson.  When they finally got the casting right, the show went from a good one to a great one.  It's too bad it took five years to come together.",1092787200,9,666,4.084615384615384
2008255,4,B0001K5GOO,"The Second Season is on the shelves...finally!! After a long wait, 'L & O: Season One' does not sit alone on my shelf. The 'Season One' set contained a small leaflet advertising an estimated release date for Season Two of Spring 2003, a year ago...

 I'm a bit disappointed though to see 'Season Fourteen' released before Seasons 3 thru 13. While collecting my favorite shows on DVD much of the enjoyment involves maintaining the shows continuity when released sequentially. It seems to preserve the integrity of the show as each character progresses along allowing the original storylines to unfold once again.

 Are there contractual limitations, or syndication problems that have created this situation? Or does the L & O distributors want only to cash in a cast that is much similar to current episodes subsequently preventing earlier actors/actresses any of the success of their work...?

 If L & O continues to be so erratic...will consider whether to invest in further releases.",1090800000,4,985,5.086956521739131

If you like Law & Order, try Homicide: Life on the Street.  Homicide didn't need ""pretty detectives"" with perfect make up to create an entertaining show.  Homicide and Law & Order RULE!",1088726400,4,402,4.577464788732394

8013524,2,B0001K5GOO,I actually like the show--my two stars are for the physical condition of the discs. They only would play the first two or three episodes on each side. The rest of the episodes skipped or wouldn't play at all. Every disc was like this. Clearly a major defect. I returned them.,1506470400,,275,4.411764705882353
