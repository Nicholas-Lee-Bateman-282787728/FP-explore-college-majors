8640407,5,B00IAEBGD8,"Larry Garner is one of my favorite performers, but I've never been able to see him perform live.  This GREAT DVD from JSP Records is the next best thing to being there.  Excellent picture, outstanding sound, plus some ""Behind The Scenes"" info and added bonuses.  Will definitely be checking out some of JSP's other DVDs in the future.",1403740800,,334,4.724137931034483
