I wish I could have the real movie.pretty soon I will make some new orders from you, anyway we will keep business flowing for a long time,thank you.",1316563200,,272,4.352941176470588
7993938,1,B00009WHT9,"Be warned, this dvd and other titles from the bootleg compnay 'Video Asia' is of unbelievably bad quality.  the picture looks like a fifth generation VHS bootleg, and worst of all, so many scenes have been removed that the film runs under 60 minutes!  scenes play out of sequence as well; this product is a mess, and I wish that amazon would not even carry this stuff from ""VideoAsia.""  They took a pan and scan picture, cropped off the top and bottom of the screen, and then STRETCHED the picture to fit that shape, so everyone looks strangely fat and distorted.  This process cuts out about half of the original picture.  Lastly, the stats offered by Amazon are wrong, (as usual.)  no Cantonese language, no English subtitles.  This is the usual poor English dubbed crap.  The film itself was great, before this label butchered it.  avoid this at all costs and hopefully a legitimate release will surface in the future.",1281657600,2,921,4.70625
7993939,5,B00009WHT9,"This is the perfect film for those of us who love the classic Shaw Bros. films of the 1970's. Films like Vengeance and Man of Iron.
Shaw star Chen Kuan Tai is in fine form,using his Monkey Fist expertise to great use.
Production value is top notch. Only drawback is a sagging story line. But the action more than makes up for it.
The DVD is hosted by Shaw Star Philip Ko Fei,who gives a great interview and demonstration.
The highlight extra is a documentary on the Shaw Studio,hosted by David Chiang.
A great film in a great package!",1063411200,3,534,4.404040404040404
