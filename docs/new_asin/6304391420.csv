7871708,5,6304391420,"I discovered ""Ed's Next Move"" on Netflix about an hour ago, in August of 2014.  This movie speaks to me on a deep level.  Sure, I've had all the usual relationship issues, and some that are unique to me and those I have met.  But this movie gives me great hope for those of us who persevere, continue to be upfront, share ourselves, keep our feelings honest, and true, as best we can, and don't give up.  Knowing my own thoughts and feelings, and relating them to others is very important to me.  Listening to the thoughts and feelings of others is actually easier, on balance, for me to do.

  The cast of this small gem of a movie have all given this film an honesty of purpose to each of their roles.  This may have been hard, and I am sure the director must have held out for the best from everyone for this film to be what it is... a wonderful slice of life as we all want it to be.  A shining star to hold up for all to see.  Thank you all for this joyous piece of work.  You have earned a special place on my Event Horizon.",1408665600,2,1030,4.044554455445544
7871709,4,6304391420,"A small gem -- nothing profound, just an off-beat romance between two slightly quirky but absolutely likable people. Callie Thorne, in particular, is wonderful in her role. The script skillfully maintains balance between being sharp and being gentle. No one would call this a ""great movie,"" but it is certainly an enjoyable one. If I have a criticism, it is that I would have liked it to go on longer, and see what happens to them further into their relationship. That is not really what the story is about -- it is about how they meet and then stumble a few times before they really get together -- but it is a testament to the characters' likability that I really would have wanted the story to continue.",1200009600,3,706,4.566929133858268
7871710,4,6304391420,"If you haven't yet seen Ed's Next Move, by writer-director John Walsh (who went on to direct 2002's equally quirky comedy, Pipe Dream), well, why are you waiting? It's one of the funniest little (I hate to use the term, but if the shoe fits...) independently produced romantic comedies ever: from Ray (Kevin Carroll), the promiscuous, Karate Master roommate, who gets his lights punched out after a gloriously intricate Bruce Lee impression; to sweet, naive Ed (Matt Ross), and his big First Date with Natalie (Callie Thorne) and the gut-bustingly funny, off-screen mouse-killing. Will the geeky, country-boy genetic engineer get the beautiful city girl? You tell me - but don't pass this one up. It's a one-of-a-kind.

My only complaint here is that the film hasn't yet been transferred to DVD and is currently only available on tape, so you'll have to dust off the old VCR to enjoy. But don't let that deter you - Siskel & Ebert loved it, giving it Two Thumbs Up!, way back in the day, when their reviews actually meant something.

As an aside, the soundtrack is even better: a totally eclectic mix of pop and jazz (Tea and Sympathy, by the Comedians, prompted me to buy the disk, and the bits by Ed's Redeeming Qualities remind of a folksier, sleepier version of the Violent Femmes - several of the songs from this soundtrack are also included on their regrettably out-of-print CD, More Bad Times), and taken as a whole, it's an all-around good time - the perfect CD companion for a long drive on a warm, lazy afternoon (and also available through Amazon).",1151798400,8,1559,4.770370370370371
7871711,5,6304391420,"This was the first romance movie I've seen, and a better experience for me since it starred my favorite actor, Matt Ross.
I didn't want to see it at first because he looked weird in all the internet pics, but he is such a hottie in this movie.
The movie itself was GREAT. It had a very wonderful feeling to it, it was quite funny, and the end made me cry with happiness. I absolutely loved it.",1036800000,4,393,4.116883116883117
