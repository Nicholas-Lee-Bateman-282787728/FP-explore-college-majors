I had placed more faith in receiving different material, then episodes of season 3.

In closing I'm saying I want my money back!

3427328,3,B001993Y6I,"I THINK I MAY HAVE ALREADY ASKED THIS. WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE BAYWATCH SEASONS? NO SEASON HAS BEEN AVAILABLE IN THE US SINCE SEASON 3 IN 2007. THIS IS SO SILLY AND RIDICULOUS. DON'T THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE THESE SHOWS REALIZE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY CAN MAKE BY RELEASING THE REST OF THE SEASONS ON DVD? I CAN'T GIVE THE SEASON MORE THAN 3 STARS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT. BUT I WAS/AM SUCH A BAYWATCH FAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER. AND WHY IS THE SHOW ONLY AVAILABLE ON DVD IN REGION 2? WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?

THE FIRST THREE SEASONS WERE RELEASED VERY QUICKLY AND CLOSE TOGETHER. I REMEMBER BUYING SEASON ONE IN OCTOBER OF 2006 AND BY THE END OF FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF 2007 I HAD PURCHASED SEASON TWO AND THREE.

WHAT A BUMMER! WAITING! WAITING! AND MORE WAITING!

WHY IS THIS HAPPENING!!!!! SHOW AFTER SHOW AFTER SHOW. WE GET TEASED WITH A FEW RELEASED SEASONS, MAYBE. ONLY TO SIT AND VEGETATE WHILE WE WAIT ON THE REMAINING SEASONS OR EPISODES. ITS JUST RIDICULOUS. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE MAY BE GETTING SEASON FOUR SOON???!!! MY QUESTION IS HOW SOON??????

HOW MANY SEASONS WERE THERE? TEN OR ELEVEN???? DOES ANYONE CARE????? JUST RELEASE THE REMAINING SEASONS SO THAT THOSE OF US WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLETE OUR COLLECTIONS CAN SEE THOSE EPISODES THAT WERE MISSED. HEY! US HARDCORE COLLECTORS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF THE SEASONS DURING OUR LIFETIME. THAT WOULD BE NICE!",1261699200,3,1382,4.472222222222222

8272826,2,B001993Y6I,"I already have a copy of Baywatch Season 3, I am holding it in my hand. I am also looking at the TV Guide sites listing of episodes. Also, the Amazon listing of episodes.

The Seasons are IDENTICAL to the season 3 listing which I already have.  It seems to be ""one"" season off. May be an overseas thing. But beware! So I am purchasing season 5.

The low rating is because of the confusion between their description (Amazon) and what they have sold in the past. I bought Season 3 a number of years ago, different packaging, but the same exact season list as this one  (4).",1456617600,,571,4.2592592592592595

8272829,1,B001993Y6I,"I was very disappointed, it was exactly the same episodes as my season 3 Baywatch. I feel that I was really ripped off. How is this going to be fixed?",1421193600,,150,4.033333333333333
8272830,5,B001993Y6I,"Same Baywatch cast members. Except for pro surfer Kelly Slater as Jimmy Slade. You get to see him as a recurring actor, in the episode, ""Skyrider"" and Tentacles pt 1.

I was about 9 years old back in fall of 1993. This was actress Nicole Eggert's last season as Summer Quinn, before her departure.

You get to see actress Yasmine Bleeth as Caroline Holden. She only plays 1 episode called, ""Tentacles pt 2,"" Then she became a part of the Baywatch cast, along with Tazmanian actor Jaason Simmons as Logan Fowler. In the next following season 5, (94-95).

These German dvds by Kinowelt, does have English language soundtrack. With it's original music montages.

Not the 3 rip off edided versions by Firstlook, released in America.

For die hard fans of Baywatch? Get the German version dvds. Just swithch the audio to English. So it feels like the 90's all over again.

No subtitles, it's fine. It's in 4:3 Full Frame in standard defintion, and 2.0 stereo surround sound.

Hint:
Buy a region free dvd player. I recommend an upconverting region free dvd player, with hdmi inputs. To display in an HDTV. Either lcd/led. From 22"" 32"" 42""

Sound from the tv is fine. Just crank the volume up. Or you can use two stereo external speakers with an amplifier. Or convert it with a 5.1 ch home receiver. Anyway you like, viewers choice.

Last of all, about the show?
Me personally, I like the epidoses, ""Lover's Cove,"" ""Blindside,"" it has actor John Allen Nelson as John D Cort from the original old school 89-90 Baywatch.

And I always enjoyed ""Coronado Del Sol pt 1&2. The comendy ""Rescue Bay,"" and finally, ""Ironman Buchanon."" Actress Lisa Stahl as Destiny Desimone, she hot.",1348531200,2,1667,4.7172413793103445
