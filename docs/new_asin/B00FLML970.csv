8616725,5,B00FLML970,"In my lifetime this is one of the greatest (yet least-shown) western yarns of all-time, because of its daring premise that mis-guided criminals are nurtured to counter ruthless tyranny (railroads) through a series of coincidences; and its sanitized though sympathetic presentation of slave relationships. To the point, this story is thrilling from beginning to end from its towering cast top to bottom, Henry Fonda, Tyrone Power, Randolph Scott, Henry Hull, Donald Meek, Jane Darwell, Nancy Kelley, John Carradine all at the top of their stature shot in brilliant technicolor with breathtaking skill on locale in the Missouri Ozark area. The other extraordinary distinction this film holds is that you must see its sequel (The Return of Frank James with nearly the same actors) to complete the Jesse James tale, although both films stand alone in impact. With this addition, it is no wonder 1939 ranks as the high-water line in film-making history. No western since has attempted to lift the veil to explore beneath the surface the roots of criminality with such flair. This film places the Jesse James legend in the realm of Robin Hood with equal force and artistry.",1491436800,,1167,5.115183246073299

8616727,3,B00FLML970,"Just okay, the movie was pretty good, but I didn't like Tyronne power in this movie at all.",1483488000,,91,4.111111111111111
8616728,4,B00FLML970,"Good movie.  The big question concerning the price of progress. Good role for Tyron Powers. I wish Fonda would have had more of a role.
Randolf Scott seemed a little out of place in this role.",1482624000,,192,4.333333333333333
8616729,3,B00FLML970,Fair. It just didn't do it for me.,1437091200,,34,3.375
8616730,5,B00FLML970,I liked this movie. I bought it because of Tyrone Power. But I would buy a video of him whittling soap figurines; he's so handsome. I didn't buy it to get educated about Jesse James only because Tyrone was in it. ahh. Would recommend it for the romance storyline.,1429660800,3,263,4.387755102040816
8616731,4,B00FLML970,"Power and Fonda...very entertaining and realistic...more fun than historically accurate...
