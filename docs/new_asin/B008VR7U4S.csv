5186183,3,B008VR7U4S,I'm not sure what I was expecting. I wasn't very impressed by it though. It was just meh...  wouldn't recommend it.,1373155200,,115,4.476190476190476
5186184,1,B008VR7U4S,This movie(?) was a complete waste of my time. I cannot even imagine that someone would take the effort to distribute this garbage.,1373155200,,131,4.739130434782608
5186185,5,B008VR7U4S,"This was one of the freshest and most honest movies I've ever seen about seeking romantic love as adults where individuals have had significant developmental issues leading to personality disorder.  The level of distrust, overemphasis on physicality due to the inability to relate on a more meaningful and gradual manner to develop enduring relationships, difficulties maintaining a sense of self while objectifying the other, other concomitant addictive behaviors and the lack of development in other facets of their lives are some of the hallmarks of the shadow existence of many individuals.  There were only moments, towards the middle, where the tension ebbed because the author-editor seemed to overemphasize the sexual addiction message to where I lost sight of the main character being a real person.  I suspect the writer knows some of this life intimately and this work represents his bravely working through, which is very brave!  This is an incredible work of film and, technically, supports the message.  As one other critic mentions, the title seems as if it is more consistent with the main characters personality rather than a smart marketing or even literary effort.  I only watched this movie after reading other viewers comments because the title is so inane.  Perhaps after making such an astounding movie, the makers did not receive the response the film deserves and simply said ""what the f..."" when they gave the film a name.  But that's not honest because the film has so much heart!!!  So, rather than shut-up, I will put-up the following suggestions:  (Just starting....)

No Hearts in LA
Find Me In LA
Confederacy of the Lost and Lonely
Missing in Action
Seeds of Discontent
Lost in Love
Hard Time for Lovers

They need to retitle this.  It's too tragic and has too much verisimilitude to be a comedy.",1373068800,2,1931,5.015673981191223
5186186,1,B008VR7U4S,"This ""movie"", and I use that term as loosely as as the sphincter of a jail house prang, is an insult to everything and anything remotely associated with Hollywood. While I have no intimate knowledge of prison life, I was reminded of an episode of ""Nip & Tuck"" where a patient had to have restorative surgery to his rear entry after a stint in the big house as, after the horrible abuse he suffered and his subsequent release, he had to have the surgery since, as he put it ( and I'm paraphrasing here) he would like to be able to get through a day without the worry of losing his bowels at any given moment.
The pimples and skunk weed were how I envisioned the crew that put this steaming pile of dung together and managed to get it released as a movie/video, because only a young, pimple faced bunch of idiots constantly stoned on low grade skunk weed could have thought (another term I'm using loosely; I doubt that there was much thinking going on at all) that this fetid collection of celluloid could possibly be considered fit for any audience whatsoever.
I highly doubt that even as they watched their ""achievement"" during the first screening they themselves could believe it was anything more than what it was; the one movie that will undoubtedly go down in the history of film that no one thought possible-worse even than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".
In fact, this collection of what should have been aborted in its last term is actually insulting to even be compared to Plan 9.
Congrats, Hollywood, you now have something worse than anything Ed Wood could have dreamed of in a shared narcotic haze with good old Bela.",1372982400,,1624,4.546075085324232
5186187,1,B008VR7U4S,Every other word was f--- not much of a plot only watched 3min. since it looked like wasted time and was going to be a porno flick which I donot mind if there is some kind of story,1372982400,,180,3.763157894736842
5186188,4,B008VR7U4S,"Since the movie, Nipples and Palm Trees, currently only has a handful of reviews, I thought I'd take the time to weigh in and put up a review of my own.  I'm not a big movie buff, although I do watch quite a few on Amazon each week, and I think I know good entertainment when I see it.

The filming style is rather gritty, not as slick looking as big-budget movies usually are.  There isn't a lot of music, but what little there is is selected well, and placed well throughout the movie.  I like the theme, I LOVE the characters.  I thought the supporting cast was more brilliant in spots than the leads.  Overall, I think this is a refreshing twist on the tired, old rom-com genre.  As some other reviewers have noted, there are some darn good one-liners in this movie that had me rolling in laughter.

Worth the watch, to be sure.  Its not your everyday flick in any sense and I wish the writer/actor great success now and in the future.  I, personally, would love to see more movies like this one.",1372982400,3,1000,4.2994652406417115
5186189,5,B008VR7U4S,This was my favorite film from 2012. The story goes from negative to positive and positive to negative.  The character you think is a creep turns out to be the one with the most heart.  It's a story about what guys think they want and what they really want.  The lead character Jackson gets himself into all these wild sexual situations only to find out it isn't what he was desiring.  It's one of the funniest films. I've watched it about seven times and I still laugh out loud at the situations.  Jackson has the BEST one liners.  It's funny and raunchy.  Check it out.,1372896000,2,571,4.380952380952381
5186190,4,B008VR7U4S,"Surprisingly funny, and witty. Jackson, the main character goes through his daily routine as a struggling artist looking for love in Los Angeles. The title might mislead you, as it almost did me, but five minutes in you realize that this is more than just a another stupid sex comedy. Director Dylan Reynolds brought across a gritty old school vibe while keeping the heart within the movie. Love is the theme. Jackson, played by Matthew James, which was also written by him does a really fine job at getting the character's struggles across on the screen. Regardless of the situation, as ridiculous as they may seem, you still feel for him on his quest to find love. Speaking of love, in comes Harmony, played by the beautiful and mysterious Sadie Katz. Harmony is a fair-weather love interest of Jackson's who tears at his heart-strings every time they come together.
Don't sleep on the supporting cast which humbly brings you Akihiro Kitamura(of Human Centipede fame)who plays Jackson's co-worker in a sales office, show years of chemistry and just some plain old funny dialogue like the old days. I'd like to see more of these guys together! Also flexing her muscle as a spiritual guide/neighbor for Jackson is Dallas Malloy. Another fine example of great chemistry in the movie.
This might not be for everybody, but for the movie lover it is worth a watch. Gonna be a cult classic if you ask me!",1364515200,9,1399,4.785123966942149
5186191,5,B008VR7U4S,"In the true spirit of the free-flowing narratives of Kerouac and Burroughs, Bukowski and (Hunter S.) Thompson, Nipples & Palm Trees takes the viewer on a surreal voyage into the maelstrom that is the lead character Jackson's life, as he searches for stimulation and purpose amidst the sinful sun-soaked back alleys of the City of Angels.

What could be an overwhelmingly depressing tale of Jackson's downward spiral of drinking, drugs and very poor choices in sexual partners is here balanced by his noble quest to win back his ex-girlfriend Harmony, the ubiquitous girl that got away- a hauntingly beautiful, ever-elusive phantom played to ethereal perfection by the gorgeous Sadie Katz. Lead actor Matthew James tackles a difficult lead role with Jackson- one fraught with many potential moral pitfalls that risk forever alienating (even nauseating) the viewer- but James negotiates the part with complete grace- never condescending to the audience, never compromising the rawness and innate lechery of his character in the hopes of scoring sympathy points with the viewer.

 Nipples & Palm Trees goes well beyond the safety line the Duchovny-driven series straddles- challenging the audience to find redemption in its main character, daring them to follow an at-times whiskey-blurred narrative. The camera always keeps the LA of the film lost in shadows or burned to light. The lost souls that populate the film merge in-and-out of focus and are lit by a garish Christmas tree-light palate that casts a grainy haze over the whole experience. Decidedly not for the timid viewer, Nipples & Palm Trees delivers a 90-minute sadomasochistic sucker-punch, grabbing you by the nethers and carrying you along for the ride.",1353888000,10,1717,5.282051282051282
5186192,3,B008VR7U4S,"First off, Who names these movies ? My gosh...
Very funny vignettes of male lead trying to find true love, Or at least Normal love.
Can't get over that title, When you watch the movie, And you should it has girls and romance and funny bits thru out,You will wonder ""WHY or Why ?"" Did they name it that...
Matthew James ( Merl  on ANGEL  tv series) is very likable and makes sense out of this love-starved artist role and has some good luck in bed too.
Sadie Katz (AB Buddy spokesmodel ) has A DEMI MOORE-esque vibe and seems a whole person in character,Not someone off a written page.
Jacqui Holland has an uncredited role as a sidewalk pickup, She and her tattoo make some very funny moments early on in film.
So, Icky title, Great premise and actors capable of making it almost 'sweet romance'.",1352246400,6,796,4.408163265306122
5186203,5,B008VR7U4S,"Some people are ripping the title of this movie......which is a sign that it's a memorable title, which it is! I think it's great!
I like the style of this movie. If you're looking for something a little different and fresh, here you go!",1390780800,3,237,4.409090909090909
5186204,1,B008VR7U4S,A lot of unnecessary cursing (f*** in every other sentence). Some abusive behavior. No evidence of a plot. No recommended.,1375056000,2,122,5.15
5186205,1,B008VR7U4S,This is a bizarre movie. Didn't even finish it - too weird. Not sure what anyone would see in this movie.,1374710400,,105,4.0476190476190474
5186206,1,B008VR7U4S,"What a piece of trash!  No story, incredibly bad camera work.  Not worth your time (or money) to give it even a glance.",1374624000,2,119,4.130434782608695
5186207,1,B008VR7U4S,It was just plain horrible horrible movie.  There was nothing at all that was appealing about this movie not even the sex scenes.,1374624000,2,129,4.608695652173913
5186208,2,B008VR7U4S,"Just what the name implies; trash.  It does nothing to portray the good side of Hollywood, rather promotes the seamier, gutter side.  Sex sells, so they say and that's what this movie is all about.",1374364800,,197,4.6
5186209,1,B008VR7U4S,"Bad movie,bad acting and no plot. Would not recommend this poor excuse for a movie! Must have cost $10,000.00 to make this movie,need I say more?",1374364800,,145,4.615384615384615
5186210,3,B008VR7U4S,Rather low class production.  I stopped watching after fifteen minutes or so.  I would not recommend this movie to others.,1374364800,,122,5.05
5186211,1,B008VR7U4S,"Boring boring, boring. No substance whatsover. No plot, no character development, no excitement, nothing of interest. Gave it 20 minutes, then started fastwarding to other parts of the movie in hopes of finding something redeeming...Nothing!",1373846400,,241,5.914285714285715
5186212,4,B008VR7U4S,I found the Nipples movie mesmerizing. It was nearly impossible to take my eyes off of Nipples. The best I've ever seen.,1373760000,,120,4.5

5186216,1,B008VR7U4S,This movie sucks and I don't know what to say because I just wanted to say that it sucked and give it 1 star and I had to write at least 20 words.,1373587200,,146,3.4545454545454546
5186217,1,B008VR7U4S,"Terrible movie, script doesn't make any sense, and totally dumb. Director should be paying viewers to leave a review after wasting our times",1373500800,,140,5.130434782608695

waste of time

word to the wise is sufficient",1373500800,,95,3.8
5186219,3,B008VR7U4S,it wasn't as 'R' as expected. The story was emotions of a 30 something male. All the expectation and excitement of a horny self absorbed american male,1373414400,,150,4.592592592592593
5186220,4,B008VR7U4S,"This flick is a winner in my book. Kind of a bad deal the main caricature no mater where he turns it is just not right.

5186222,1,B008VR7U4S,I cannot believe this movie would interest anyone other than the writer or director or producer.  Perhaps some sort of narcissistic voyage by someone with money.  I hopped around the movie somewhat trying to find ANYTHING interesting and could not.,1373155200,2,248,5.175

8531144,4,B008VR7U4S,"Per the title it was totally not what I was expecting but in a good way. Matthew James is trying to find true love in an unlikely place, the dark back streets of the City of Angels. There are some quite funny sections during his surreal voyage but it is at it's heart a very touching love story of his desire to win back the affections of his ex girlfriend the drop dead gorgeous Sadie Katz. It's interesting cinematography to boot and will keep you interested throughout. Not your everyday love story and kudos for that.",1477353600,,521,4.4375
