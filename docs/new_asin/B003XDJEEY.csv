4216364,5,B003XDJEEY,"What can I say, I love Christian and Gospel music, and David's voice, great idea for a Christmas special in a humble barn where it all started. Anyone who believes Christmas is all about Christ will love this DVD and I bought four for gifts.",1357084800,,241,4.377777777777778
4216365,5,B003XDJEEY,"David Phelps is a very accomplished and gifted singer!
He is ONE OF A KIND!
His skills equal Pavarotti.
I am so grateful to have found him!",1355529600,4,139,4.185185185185185
4216366,5,B003XDJEEY,"I cannot believe the voice David
Phelps has.  Nobody sings Oh, Holy
Night like he does.  Except for
Sandi Patty, but she is a girl.
This is a beautiful DVD to have.",1301270400,,164,4.09375
4216367,4,B003XDJEEY,"I really enjoyed this video. David is so awesome that I can just listen to the songs over and over again. He is so darn like-able, and a talent like no other. His kids are so cute, and if I ever meet him I want to know how he got his 3 year old to sit with him and be still and quiet for ""I'll Be Home""...he's obviously a much better parent than I am!",1300233600,,351,3.6933333333333334
4216368,4,B003XDJEEY,"Well, I enjoyed this DVD. No, it is not altogether traditional, but I am thinking that it is what David wanted to do. There are some precious scenes when he sings to his little boy, and I enjoy the group togetherness. I have his other Christmas DVD as well, and if he makes another I will have it too!  This is a good DVD; it is just different. Gives me a chance to learn some new songs, and hear some old favorites.

4216369,1,B003XDJEEY,"I like David.  He has a great voice and it's gets better every year.  But, I guess on this record he was trying to do ""his own thing"" and ""be himself"".  Unfortunately, it just didn't hit me as being a good Christmas Record.",1295136000,,223,4.1395348837209305
