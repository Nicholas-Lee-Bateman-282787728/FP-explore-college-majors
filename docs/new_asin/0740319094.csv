7801203,3,0740319094,"This really comes across as a low budget, good faith attempt to show what heaven will be like when someone passes, and thus very inspirational, uplifting and consoling for someone just losing a loved one.  The first of the set is Jimmy Hansen's Heaven, about someone who has a cardiac arrest and it shows what it's like on his first day in heaven, as they are trying to revive him in the ER.  For example, at the very end his guardian angel, played by Barry McGuire, comes upon the ER team saying he's not having a very good day, and Barry says, ""You can't imagine how wrong you are.""

The second of the set, also 40 minutes in length (so the combined length is about the same as a feature length film), Josh's Journey, has a different theme (except for its ending) and is a very good portrayal of the struggles a teen is having after having been caught for drug abuse and being on probation for that, as well as family problems.  However, he accepts Jesus and is saved in the middle of his struggles.  Again, very uplifting; it's great to see a kid turn from evil and come to Jesus.  One keeps seeing reminders it's a low budget, B-movie, but as they say about some people, it ""has a good heart"" and most Christians can overlook the unrealistic aspects of the two movies for the sake of the uplifting aspects of these two movies.  It's not the realistic, well made movies more recently created by PureFlix Entertainment, for example, as it seems Christian movies keep coming into the high tech, movie making age of quality films, but it's an uplifting message and I certainly was not tempted even for a second to shut it off and end prematurely the great message it portrayed.  I feel blessed for having watched it and surely many others will be too.  Probably the most encouraging part was seeing the teen choose to accept Jesus in Josh's Journey.",1399680000,,1849,4.495522388059701

7801205,5,0740319094,"This was a great movie! Good for all ages, especially for anyone who just experienced a loss of a loved one. I showed this in my Sunday School class and there was hardly a dry eye in the bunch. May not be an actual description of what heaven is like, but I really hope it's like that!",1300060800,,284,4.0
7801206,5,0740319094,"This movie will make you wonder what heaven will really look like. I would reccomend it to anyone. I think it would also be great for someone who just lost a loved one and wants to know more about heaven. Jesus said he couldn't describe heaven to us because it doesn't compare to anything on earth. I think they did a wonderful job with this movie showing us what heaven might be like. We'll just have to wait until our time and see what it's really like, but until then we can enjoy this movie and imagine for ourselves what it might be like once we go there.",1297468800,,560,4.194444444444445
