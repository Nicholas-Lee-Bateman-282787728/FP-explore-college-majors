1894855,5,B00009WVRZ,"As a certified and notarized film critic, it is my professional opinion that The Greenskeeper is the greatest film in history of American cinema. This film is an example of story telling at its finest, and surpasses such classics as Citizen Kane and Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise. The cast performances are supberb, and if there was any justice in the world, John Rocker would have received several academy awards. I'd never heard of this young and comely actor before this film, but he certainly has a bright future ahead of him.
The cost of this DVD is well worth the price, and I would like to encourage all who read this review to purchase this film, and to purchase additional copies for Christmas, birthday, Easter, Valentine's, Kwanzaa, Summer Solstice, and getting-out-of-jail gifts for friends and relatives.",1059609600,4,830,4.935714285714286
1894856,4,B00009WVRZ,This is a classic.  I am one of the few that could care less what John Rocker said and just enjoy him as a person.  He is funny and really a cool guy.  The inclusion of Southside Steve and Milkman Larry from the Regular guys is great.  They are very humorous and their radio show in Atlanta is spectacular.  If you get an Xm radio look them up in the morning.  They are great friends with Jimmy Kimmel and they all influence each other in there artform.  This makes this movie a classic.  A great B-movie.,1058400000,2,505,4.1875
1894857,5,B00009WVRZ,"I am a huge fan of B movies and it's this kind of movie that makes me one.  This movie is new and refreshing.  The death scenes are very unique.  You can also add that there are three fine women that bare there tops in this soon to be classic.  So if you and guys are looking for a great movie to pass the time away, get out the beers and sit back and relax as this ABOVE PAR movie slashes it's way on your screen.",1056412800,8,414,3.7790697674418605

1894929,5,B00009WVRZ,"Allen ( Allelon Ruggiero) is the under achiever assistant greenskeeper who wants to be a script writer. His step-father is the co-owner of the country club where he works. Allen also has a bodacious blond girlfriend (Allison Kulp) who has personality issues with a capital ""B.""

There is a legend about a former greenskeeper who was disfigured in a fire. He lives in a shack in the woods and vows revenge against everyone.  A group of young adults plan an after hours party  with Alan being able to sneak them in.  I think you know the rest.

This film is a hybrid between a slasher film and a slasher spoof. In the middle of the film, they are watching another slasher film where they introduce a criticism of their own movie.

This movie includes a  flamboyant police officer Cox (John Judy), chesty blonds, stereo type names Chas, Chip, Champ, and Chet, as well as class humor. ""We pay them minimum wage, you would think they would try to earn it."" The girls are named Mary Katherine, Mary Jane and Mary Beth...sort of like Heathers or Debbie for you ""Oblong"" fans.

1894930,4,B00009WVRZ,"My brother bought me this movie for Christmas after attending its theatrical debut. Not only do I love this movie, I hope they make a sequel!",1328486400,3,141,4.461538461538462
1894931,2,B00009WVRZ,"a buddy of mine who owns the film and myself have a debate over whether this film really leans more toward a ""spoof"" or a ""mostly straight-up slasher film"". I'm the latter. regardless of who's right lets say it's both....the movie fails as a ""spoof"" because it doesn't spoof very well, there's no real obvious movie or movies this film spoofs. There is a bit of humor with local Atlanta radio personalities ""Southside Steve Rickman"" and one of ""The Regular Guys"" idiots doing some mighty poor acting/comedy/spoof/whatever...it don't work as performance comedy. And there is the acting....the acting....oh how bad is the acting....it so bad it's hard to tell if its spoofery, or just bad, it's no good as either. Practically every scene looks like it was the first take. Uncomfortable exchanges between actors, miserable attempts at campiness, lame dialoug. The production values are as cheap-looking as they come, the dialoug is terrible, and the horror scenes are weak. Weak as in not funny or scarey. What IS funny is taking this film as a serious horror film and laughing at it's insipidness. What's not funny is taking this film as a spoof for comedic value. The direction doesn't sell it as a quality spoof. The same can be said for the direction as selling it as a straight-up horror genre. can you say Identity Crisis? Lord knows I can barely spell it.  The actors are third-rate leftovers and the babes are in need of a few hours at the gym if their going to reveal so much skin. The one good thing about this film is the nice use of beautiful golden light used for the daytime outdoor shots. I love a good spoof, the cheesier the better, the cheaper the better, heck I love it when the set walls shake when the doors close if its a spoof, but this film doesn't pass muster as a spoof which leads me to believe that it was intended to be a horror film, which is just as sad. One final thing about the Atlanta radio guys....just give it up. Please, you're horrible on the radio and seeing your ugly mugs on film doing a horrible job is too much punishment the public does not deserve.",1124150400,,2091,4.576
1894932,3,B00009WVRZ,"This is one of those movies that's bad -- but in an goofy, entertaining way, something you'd watch with your buddies and some beers when you don't have something more profound to do.

It's also the first movie about which I've ever had some inside scoop. My friend J. was formerly roommates with Kevin Greene (writer, producer, co-director, played ""Chip"") back in Georgia, and this film featured several of their buddies. (I guess they're all those previous reviewers from Georgia).

So yeah, I'm sure I appreciated the movie more than I otherwise would have thanks to J.'s running commentary and anecdotes. Supposedly, the seeds of this film were planted when the two started joking about what if a horror film featured a guy getting his nards caught in a golfball cleaner, and evolved from there. Hey, it's weird but it's fun, and better than a lot of things you end up watching.",1110931200,,881,4.7894736842105265
1894933,3,B00009WVRZ,"""The Greenskeeper"" either represents the absolute nadir of the slasher film or it is one of the cleverest spoofs of the genre to appear on the scene. I'm not sure yet, even weeks after watching the movie. If this picture had come out before ""Scream,"" I think I would land on the side of ""absolute nadir."" But ever since Wes Craven poked a bit of fun at the very genre he helped construct, one must look at a film like ""The Greenskeeper"" in a different way. Maybe, just maybe, the filmmakers decided to shoot for cult status by intentionally making a bad film. The lure of the ""so bad it's good"" label draws more attention than we think amongst low budget filmmakers. And why not? There are films from twenty or thirty years ago that should have faded away five minutes after opening in a theater, but they didn't because they captured that certain something which allowed them to remain firmly planted in the minds of lovers of bad cinema. There are actors, too, that make millions because they appeared in some much beloved piece of junk. Is this the fate of ""The Greenskeeper"" and leading actor Allelon Ruggiero? I don't know. Only time will tell.

In the meantime, allow me to waste a few minutes of your life telling you about the film. ""The Greenskeeper"" is your typical slasher film set on a golf course. Years before, the Greenskeeper (John Rocker) perished in an unfortunate accident involving an exploding golf cart and a terrible fire. Burned over most of his body, the Greenskeeper didn't survive for very long, or at least that's the official story. Flash forward to the present, where we see Allen (Allelon Ruggiero) attempt to deal with his pathetic existence. He's got a volatile girlfriend, Mary Katherine (Allison Kulp), who wants to leave him because he can't seem to advance beyond his job of assistant greenskeeper at the club. Allen also has a bunch of deadbeat friends who do nothing except sit around in front of the television set all day wacked out of their minds. And his parents--oh baby! You see, Allen is the son of the original, long lamented greenskeeper, but his mother (who owns the golf course) sort of went to pieces after the accident and now drinks herself into a stupor. She also married a smarmy jerk, Mr. Anderson (Bruce Taylor), who runs the golf course as the new greenskeeper. It is this chap who gave Allen a lowly job, and it is this guy who torments him on a regular basis. Allen's only friends are Otis (Thomas Merdis), an elderly African-American who can't seem to fix a lawnmower, and the pretty clubhouse server Elena (Melissa Ponzio), with whom Allen wouldn't mind striking up a relationship.

Most of the above information is all surface detail, as most of the seedier behavior goes on behind the scenes. Mary Katherine, for instance, is a hardcore drug abuser who repeatedly stabs Allen in the back every chance she gets. While she plays the part of faithful companion to Allen in front of his wealthy parents, Mary Katherine hangs out with the club's bimbos and meatheads. This group of incorrigible airheads convinces Allen to let them into the club at night for an evening of heavy partying. Immediately prior to the party, Allen discovers startling evidence that his mother planned on letting him run the course until Anderson married her. None of this matters initially because someone, we immediately presume the deceased greenskeeper, has returned to the club in order to wreak bloody havoc on anyone within easy reach. The partygoers soon find out that sneaking into the clubhouse was an extremely poor idea. The killer dispatches the young people in inventive ways. One of Mary Katherine's friends expires when the maniac runs a part of him through the golf ball washer. Did you know you could use one of those tools for digging new putting green holes to punch through someone's back? You can!

I won't spoil the ending for you except to say we finally see Allen come into his own and learn about a plot twist that we saw coming from miles away. What I can say is this: ""The Greenskeeper"" is a mess in terms of the acting, the script, the editing, and the pacing. Sure, John Rocker appears in the movie (a gimmick if there ever was one), but he utters only a few words and gets little screen time. Allelon Ruggiero, known primarily for his performance in ""The Dead Poets Society"" a few years back, looks like he thought the whole movie was a goof--I swear he almost burst out laughing in at least one scene. Allison Kulp practically descends into camp playing the naughty Mary Katherine, and her friends aren't much better. The dialogue is leaden and laughable, about as leaden as the pacing of the movie. As for the editing, well, I've seen broken piatas that hang together better than the scenes in this film. Note to film editor: next time use a machine to cut the film instead of a chainsaw. But, and this is a big exception to these flaws, the gore effects aren't half bad. Lots of blood flows in ""The Greenskeeper,"" which, even though it's often played for laughs, does help move the film along.

Extras include filmographies, the revelation that Kip Winger composed the score (!), and a bunch of trailers for ""The Greenskeeper,"" ""Firefight,"" ""Mary Christmas,"" and ""Fire Over Afghanistan."" As many problems as I had with this film, I would probably watch it again if given the chance. I'm even thinking about subjecting my girlfriend to the movie, just to see her reaction. Will ""The Greenskeeper"" eventually achieve cult status? Who knows, but it's somewhat fun if you're in the right mood for it.",1100304000,4,5567,4.718396711202467
1894934,2,B00009WVRZ,"Admittedly, casting Atlanta Braves' bad boy John Rocker as a serial killer was an inspired piece of casting.  However, big John is hardly in the film at all.  Which means we're left with a cast of really bad actors running around in their bathing suits and what not, and even with some innovative methods of offing the victims, THE GREENSKEEPER breaks no new ground in the art of film-making.  There are, however, some priceless lines:  having three of the boytoys named Chad, Chet and Chuck (or something like that); when one of the bimbos has to cancel her vacation because the island is being taken over by guerillas, she innocently says ""I didn't even know they had a zoo.""
