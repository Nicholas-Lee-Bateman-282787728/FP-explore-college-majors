7946130,5,B00005N5RA,3 films of around 30 minutes each are on the DVD. Each story is funny and I had a great time to watch them. The time with Halloween was perfect.,1386806400,,144,3.8333333333333335
7946131,1,B00005N5RA,"The story line is ok but the series sucks!

See the Original movie with a fetching young Fairuza Balk as Mildred Hubble.

Even my niece who's 7 hated this movie but loved the original. When she saw that there was a series on tape she made me buy the first one then cried when she saw it and wanted to break it.

If you can, skip the music video by Curry and concentrate on the movie. You'll love it !!!!!!!!!!",1107907200,,409,4.0875

This DVD is a great, charming, NOT CHEESY & A MORE MODERN adaption of the Jill Murphy books, starring GEORGINA SHERRINGTON as Mildred Hubble, the cute bumbling witch.
A co production from Canada/United Kingdom-for HBO family.
This is the second DVD---Battle Of The Broomsticks being the first----it contains three episodes. And is definitely viewable NOT JUST ON HALLOWEEN---
A MEAN HALLOWEEN----In the first episode, the girls learn that the school is preparing to put on a play for the grand wizard ---Miss Bats wants to do this hip Halloween song, but Miss HardBroom insists it be traditional.
Miss HardBroom's class has been chosen to represent the school, which makes her a little wary, because Mildred's in her class--To choose who will play the good witch Lucy who rescues the suffering peasants from a tyrannical Baron in the play, Miss HardBroom wants to be fair and picks the name out of a cauldron---and wouldn't you know it, it's Mildred!
Mildred's part means she has to brush up on her Broom flying skills. And she can't fly very well, on HER broom---since in the first episode it was broken in half and clumsily repaired with packing tape-- so Ethel reluctantly offers her broom, but she just can't be nice to poor Mildred and casts a spell on it --subsequently ruining the presentation when Mildred crashes in to the grand wizard.
Now everyone thinks it's Mildreds fault the school was humiliated--Mildred runs away
EPISODE TWO--DOUBLE DOUBLE TOIL AND TROUBLE
Is a continuance of episode one---Mildred discovers a plot to overtake the school by over-hearing three witches in the forest---one of whome looks remarkably like Miss Cackle---
Their plan is to sneak into the school and turn all the students and teachers into toads, since after Halloween it's a tradition for everyone to oversleep, it may have been easy if it weren't for Mildred!
In the third episode---MONKEY BUSINESS---
We meet new comer Enid Nightshade, Mildred is in charge of showing the new girl around. Enid is kind of quiet at first.
And she thinks the castle is pretty boring, no matter how exciting Mildred tries to make it sound.
But she's making trouble for Mildred--she purposely sings off key in chanting class, making Mildred laugh.
Mildred finds out she keeps a monkey ""Coco""---
And she after she sees how mean Ethel is, Enid sabotages a stage set to fall right on her head----of course Miss HardBroom thinks it was Mildred--she gives Enid and Mildred the chore of scrubbing the staircase---but Enid ditches the job to have more fun
Mean while, Mr. Blossom is battling some kind of mutant fungus growing on the castle walls (yuk!)
And Enids monkey escapes from her room--going out Ethel's window, and putting on her school uniform tie in the process of climbing out on to the roof---Mildred has to chase after it on her broom---and we know flying isn't Mildred strong suit----
When HB sees Coco wearing Ethel's school uniform tie she thinks it's Ethel------Well we eventually see Enid isn't all that bad, when she comes to clear every thing up
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a delightful, whimsical and nicely presented----
If you're familiar with this series from HBO (and like it) THAT'S GREAT! --If you're not; check it out!
Great for children and people young at heart---beautifully filmed with great sets and outdoor scenes shot in the gorgeous Canadian countryside and forest---and with a wonderful cast--- VERY CUTE, WHOLESOME and LIKEABLE

7946133,5,B00005N5RA,"I loved the book so much as a child that I read it to death! I've added the D.V.D to my wish list with my fingers crossed and hope to get it for my 8 year old son. Just an excuse for me to watch it though! I'm 28 now and am so glad to find it still popular all these years later, Mildred Hubble is the clumsy young girl we can all identify with. It's full of characters that are so like those we meet when at school that you feel empathy with Mildred. Who remembers the square creep like Ethel?
Definitly a must for nostalga and will live on in generations to come!",1009065600,3,565,3.9217391304347826
