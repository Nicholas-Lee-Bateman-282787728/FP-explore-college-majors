It had the worst CGI imaginable and the big-big-biggest Bigfoot ever, although sometimes he towered over the trees and sometimes the trees towered over him which was confusing.  Bonaducci overacted but I kind of think he was emoting on purpose, and why not? This as a cryptid of a cryptid which nobody in the movie seemed to really be too concerned about. Yes, you found a Bigfoot, and it attacked a 80's flashback rock concert headlined by Alice Cooper (who was very good, BTW) and no body else, and there were over 70 people in attendance, in a national park, in which they supposedly deforested 50 acres, the day before the concert, which was expected to take place in a snowstorm. I think that with all that going on, a cryptid of a cryptid in actually quite believable. However, the sheriff of Deadwood, South Dakota nearly ordering the destruction of Mt Rushmore National Monument is a bit of a stretch.  Anyway, dumb plot, kookie story, bad acting, terrible CGI but kind of funny.",1527379200,,1023,4.709497206703911

8524296,4,B00834JQZ0,"Bad acting with painful dialogue at times but I still enjoyed this movie.  Was great to see Danny Bonaduce & Barry Williams in this flick.  ( I thought Maureen McCormack was in the film as well but its apparently a Marcia Brady look a like)
The film really could have used a firearms consultant.  When Sherilyn Fenn pulls the charging handle on an AR, you can see the airsoft hop-up.  (See attached picture)  The AK-47's charging handles don't reciprocate when fired & one close up of a M249 Squad Automatic Weapon or SAW shows the airsoft BB feed tube coming from the ""magazine bag"".  I don't think I'm being picky here; a lot of effort when into this flick & these are simple mistakes which should have been caught.  But all in all I enjoyed this video and had a good time watching it.
PS:  This isn't your ""Harry and the Hendersons"" bigfoot; this guy is seriously pi55ed off, ALL THE TIME!",1487376000,,892,4.462962962962963

8524298,4,B00834JQZ0,"Actors Barry Williams & Danny Bonaduce were great in this very funny movie. I don't know whether funny was the Director's intent, but we were laughing. Also featured the great Alice Cooper in a hilarious scene. The only thing I could mark down on this film is that they made Bigfoot King Kong size. C'mon really. All in all glad I made this purchase.",1429488000,,350,4.484375

8524300,5,B00834JQZ0,"I bought this movie because Alice Cooper has a cameo in it, I'm a huge Alice Cooper fan & like to collect everything & anything he does. I never intended to watch the whole movie but we were looking after a friends two teenage boys and decided to play this for some light entertainment. The film is poorly made, edited & acted but it took me back to my childhood watching Deadly Earnest at midnight on channel 0 & the B grade horror flicks they used to show. We had a great laugh watching this movie!",1409270400,2,500,4.21875
8524301,4,B00834JQZ0,"This documentary exposes the exploitation of Has-beens by small independent film makers.  It also calls for environmental protection against the use of CGI to replace wildlife (specifically, Bigfoot).",1399334400,6,200,6.142857142857143
8524302,2,B00834JQZ0,"I hate to admit it, but I was a fan of ""The Partridge Family"" and ""The Brady Bunch"" back in the 70s.  Why?  Well, I was young and dumb is all I can say.  Being older and wiser, I saw that Danny and Barry were going head-to-head on the SciFi channel tonight (2012June30), so I just HAD to watch.

There is a scene where Barry is going to sing at the county fair, and I exclaimed, ""Go, Johnny Bravo!"" (wasn't that his alter-ego as the young, up-and-coming singer?)  But unfortunately, Barry's lost some of his skills - particularly in the singing department - but luckily, Alice Cooper came in to save the day.  Well, at least until Bigfoot had his way with the rocker turned wannabe golf pro.  (Doesn't AC spend more time on the golf course these days than the stage?  Gotta be safer when Bigfoot's around.)

This film is bad.  Really bad.  But it is bad in a ""good"" way I suppose, since it will keep you laughing.  But Blu-ray?  Do you really want to waste 25 Gigs on this stuff?  How about ordering it on DVD instead.  Better yet, is VHS still available?  That way, you can't see how bad the ""special"" effects are.",1341014400,7,1115,4.314009661835748
