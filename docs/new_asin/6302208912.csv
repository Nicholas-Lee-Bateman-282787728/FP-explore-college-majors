What a trial it was for Edison to come up with the proper element to invent the first electric lightbulb and put away the gas lights that were so common in his day.

This is a story of Thomas Edison as he went through his early struggles to get established and get started in his development of inventions.

446771,5,6302208912,"After the success of BOY'S TOWN in 1938, MGM didn't take too long to once more feature Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney in the same project, sort of. 1940 marked Hollywood's two-part silver screen biography of the Wizard of Menlo Park. YOUNG TOM EDISON came first and was a hit and showcased an exuberant Mickey Rooney (somewhere, there is private footage of Mickey Rooney NOT being exuberant, but that's probably secreted away deep in MGM's vaults). Three months later, EDISON THE MAN was released and became an even bigger sensation. Spencer Tracy brings a vital and human presence to the role. Guy is such a natural actor. He may have been the most natural actor of his era. I heard Spencer Tracy once punched Lee Strasberg in the face, but I'm probably fibbing.

EDISON THE MAN is predominantly a flashback story. It opens in 1929, as an aged Thomas Edison is about to be feted in a banquet. Nestled in his seat of honor, as he is introduced to the audience, Edison hearkens back to his early days as a struggling inventor. The camera then shifts to the late 19th century and comes to focus on Edison, still a telegrapher but in the prime of his life and arriving in New York. Whereas YOUNG TOM EDISON was a more boisterous picture - how could it not be with Mickey Rooney on board? - EDISON THE MAN comes off as a more thoughtful and earnest biographical drama. And it is top notch. The clever thing about applying the flashback technique is that the narrative can effortlessly skip ahead to the more pertinent bits. We track Edison's days of barely scraping by and of his (somewhat glossed over) romance with his future bride (Rita Johnson). We eyeball his first lucrative invention - the stock ticker - which allows him to establish his own research lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey.

The film is improved tremendously by a cast of noted character actors. This includes Charles Coburn and Gene Lockhart who, respectively, play Edison's benefactor and his primary antagonist. It is not known whether Coburn or Lockhart clocked Lee Strasberg.

I don't know how faithful this picture is. It's almost a given that certain liberties were taken, that events were tweaked or plain made up to put a shine on the narrative. Thomas Edison and his inventing group created ten thousand patents, but we only see a few of his inventions spotlighted on screen: the stock ticker, the phonograph, the electric vote recorder which, as we see early in the film, can be converted into a device to age whiskey. Edison gazes bemusedly at his mutated vote recorder and remarks: ""Well, that settles that. That's my first and my last invention!"" But we know better.

The second half of the picture is dedicated to Edison's many frustrated attempts to perfect the incandescent lamp (which is a sexier description than ""electrical light bulb""). When an associate blunders and foolishly declares to the press that Edison had indeed invented electrical light, well, the pressure's on Edison to prove the boast true. Even as his detractors and scientific rivals scoff at his claim. And that's the film's primary conflict. Can the Wizard of Menlo Park contradict his naysayers' assertion that ""electrical light is as impossible as perpetual motion""? There's a wee chance that the scriptwriters may have fabricated Edison's climactic race against time to install his illumination system in New York City.

MGM's art department accessed extensive archival film footage and photos to slavishly recreate Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park. But as much as MGM was going for authenticity, EDISON THE MAN is still very much a blend of fact and myth. It's a wonderful movie, with Spencer Tracy lending marvelous gravitas and his own brand of authenticity. Is the movie sentimental? Absolutely. Does it fail to address Edison's nastier side? Yes, it does. But this is a love letter, not an expos, to one of the world's greatest inventors. And, thankfully, bits of humor pop up to puncture that air of earnestness. EDISON THE MAN is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration, and 100% entertaining. You should see it. Nikola Tesla would want you to. No, wait, he probably wouldn't.",1345939200,4,4133,4.873399715504979

446816,5,6302208912,"Spencer Tracy did a fine job portraying Thomas Edison, the tramp tlelgrapher on though his life highlighting some of his finest inventions, including the phonograph, light bulb, early power stations, including the mis-haps when the governors operating the steam engines operating the generators when they first lit up part of New York are accurate, and, show the adventures, and, fears of the group of men when the mis-matched governors caused the generators to hunt, making one trying to run the other as a motor.
I don't know haw the producers of this movie re-created this event managed to get the equipment to do this, but, in my view, they did an excellent job of it.
I enjoyed watching how Edison, and, his crew invented the light bulb, and, kept an eye to see how long it would last in his laboratory.
While there may be minor inefficientcies on some of it, including on the phonograph, the movie, as a whole was well done. Spencer Tracy did a fine acting job of his part of Edison, and, the other actors who portrayed other people he was associated with also did a fine job.
I highly reccommend this movie to everyone...It is an accurate account of the inventor's life, as a whole...

446820,4,6302208912,"You don't see these kind of old-fashioned biographies anymore. There have been very few in the last 40 years. Yes, many of the classic biographies sugar-coated the stories, ignoring a person's negative traits, but today's films mostly do the opposite, so it's nice to re-visit a movie in which an American hero is shown as just that. One gets tired of all the trashing.

Thomas Alva Edison certainly was a hero with his incredible inventions (i.e., the light bulb) which affected almost everyone on the planet to a significant degree. This movie goes to great lengths to show Edison's persistence in reaching his goals while also highlighting the dedication of the men who worked for him.

Spencer Tracy as Edison, along with Rita Johnson, Lynne Overman, Charles Coburn, Gene Lockhart, Henry Travers and Felix Bressart make this a pretty solid movie. It's not spectacular, probably not worth more than one look, maybe two, but it's a story that should be seen about an amazing period in history.",1234051200,,995,4.952095808383233

446824,5,6302208912,"""Edison, The Man,"" directed in 1940 by Clarence Brown, remains one of the best bio-pics from MGM's Golden Years.  Spencer Tracy stars as Thomas Alva Edison, who looks back on his legendary career as the reluctant guest of honor at the 1929 Golden Jubilee of Light.  Told in flashbacks, the film traces Edison's career from the time he arrived penniless in New York to his triumph with the incandescent electric light in 1879 when he lit the city by electricity.  The act of invention has never been more interesting, as when Edison comes up with the idea for a talking machine.  The story is necessarily episodic in nature, but Tracy's performance and narration hold the entire thing together, reaffirming his place as our greatest film actor.  ""Edison, The Man"" features Rita Johnson as Edison's future wife Mary, Lynne Overman as ""Bunt"" Cavatt, Charles Coburn as General Powell, and Henry Travers as Ben Els.  The montage at the end of the film, where Edison ages as his many inventions fly by on the screen, is a nice reminder of why Edison was widely considered the smartest American who ever lived.  His list of inventions certainly quantifies him as the most prolific scientist.",994204800,37,1184,4.8606965174129355
