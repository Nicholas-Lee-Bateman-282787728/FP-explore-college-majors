Beast From Haunted Cave-This movie stars that guy who played the god Apollo in that original Star Trek episode, cool. The monster is sort of a giant spider thing. The one effect that does make the movie stand out is that the monster cocoons its victims, 35 years before the same idea would be used in the classic Aliens, (or Alien, if you count the scene that was scrapped for the 1979 release). All in all, a nice drive-in type monster monvie double bill.",1287100800,,718,4.446969696969697
