5538622,4,B00B00HUC0,Maverick is one of the best of old time tv shows. The blend of action and humor is perfectly blended in this classic western tv show.,1366761600,3,133,4.153846153846154
5538623,4,B00B00HUC0,"Not a moment too soon we are blessed with the second season of ""Maverick"", the full 26 episodes presented in glorious black and white.

Starring James Garner as the always affable, sometimes scheming Bret Maverick in the role that made him famous. He appears even more comfortable this season and with the support of his trusting brother Bart, played with great aplomb by Jack Kelly, we get to enjoy some of the best episodes this vaunted series has to offer.

Certainly one of my favorites and arguably a signature episode of the series is ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"" that features many of the series regulars who helped make ""Maverick"" so special. ""Shady Deal"" features a great set-up that is executed to perfection which would be mimicked by future TV shows and movies like ""The Sting"".

Other highlights include a young pre-Rawhide Clint Eastwood in ""Duel at Sundown"" who keeps calling our hero mister ""Mav-er-AAACK"", ""The Day They Hanged Bret Maverick"" and ""The Spanish Dancer"" featuring Slim Pickens. However, all of the episodes are enjoyable to watch and vastly entertaining.

As for the DVDs themselves, little has changed since the first series was released last year. The packaging is fine, but there are no extras, only the insert which lists each episode, the date it appeared with a synopsis of the plot. The overall video quality is also fair to good with noticeable wear and scratches present so like the first season I am docking this DVD set one star. However, this should not be seen as a criticism of the episodes themselves which are still highly entertaining and wonderful to see again.

I highly recommend the second season of Maverick as being just as much fun today as it was when it first aired back in 1958, a testament to the strong storyline, great supporting cast and the magnetic characters of Bret and Bart Maverick.",1366761600,46,1848,4.8354430379746836
5538624,5,B00B00HUC0,"I'll buy season three as soon as it comes out, and I'm pretty sure it will. This was One of my all time fav tv shows as a kid. They're in B/W but have pretty good picture quality.
I must admit that a few things on some episodes kind of bug me, watching now as an adult. Like the ""Alias Bart Maverick"" episode where the indians can't track or even know about a cave in their own land. That was pretty far from reality, and I think most Native Americans would jeer at it.  Most episodes were well written though and it's well worth the money.",1366675200,3,540,4.09433962264151
5538625,5,B00B00HUC0,"Comments after getting the DVD:  My rating holds, this was an excellent series, entertaining and done well so it's timeless and not ""cheesy"" nor sophmoric now like many old TV shows are when viewed today.  Even  our kids enjoy watching it.  But some things seem different.  Might be my memory of this decades-old show, but I have a pretty clear memory in the episode I noted below where the bad guy realizes that he's been had, goes to get Maverick off the stage coach only to find that yes, Maverick asked about the stage but actually took the train in the other direction, and there's this hilarious ""jackass music"";  In this DVD, no music, it seems like a different ending.  Again, memory can be wrong and that seems like the most likely explanation, I may be criss-crossing episodes, but it just doesn't seem that way.  Did the DVD use an alternate ending for some reason?  In any case, still highly recommended and just as good as expected, but a few things seem changed.  Probably just the passage of time.  I guess this is the way it starts...

Video and audio quality are excellent, no problems.

********************************************************************************************

Note: This is an early review on concept, the DVD is pre-ordered and I have not yet received it.  Will update after. [Update above]

The old Warner Brothers TV series, Maverick, was one of TV's best shows, and finally WB seems to have released it to DVD's after decades of waiting.  I see that the individual seasons are available and also the entire series.  In terms of me having time to actually view the whole series, which is unlikely, and in terms of cost (both the purchase price for the whole series plus getting a divorce since my wife would shoot me if I bought the entire series), I opted for the second season, which seems to have many of the most memorable, best episodes.  There's one where a banker cheats Bret Maverick out of late-night gambling winnings and how Bret gets it back while seemingly doing nothing, and the ""jackass music"" at the end when the crooked banker realizes that he's been had, well worth the DVD all by itself.  If folks remember some of the old, great Western TV shows like Gunsmoke, Have Gun - Will Travel, etc., there's a Maverick second season episode that satirizes them, and does a great job of it.  Everyone will have their favorite episodes, and some will want the whole season, but this second season has the strongest appeal for me.

So, I'm looking forward to this in a few weeks.  When I receive and view it, I will update this.  Hopefully audio and visual quality will be good, etc.  But this was arguably the best season of a great show in the golden age of TV, so I can't wait!",1365379200,6,2730,4.6968421052631575
5538626,5,B00B00HUC0,Maverick is the best TV western ever made.  The serious themes with comedic overtones makes it a joy to watch.  Great entertainment!,1364601600,9,132,4.954545454545454

5538628,5,B00B00HUC0,"James Garner appeared on MAVERICK for three of the five seasons. The fourth and fifth season are average when compared to other Warner Westerns but the first three seasons of MAVERICK are worth owning and watching. Garner had his choice of scripts so the ones with Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) are weaker than the others. Still, the boys are in rare form and prime to cheat the gamblers who cheated innocent victims. The complete season is uncut in this box set from Warner Brothers and here's hoping they put out all five seasons (even though I might not buy seasons four and five).",1363910400,31,581,4.650485436893204

5538647,5,B00B00HUC0,"Excellent Quality, excellent packaging--a little synopsis-book is included with the DVD so that you can read up on the episodes to find which one you're wanting but don't know the name of the episode, which is usually the way.  I still was hanging on to my old VCR tapes of this show, as it took awhile to come around to DVD and an affordable price.  Then, you have to trust that the entire episode makes it to the DVD, as sometimes corners are cut and bits of the show lopped off cheapening the quality of the show.  Amazon had a good sale on this one day so I took the plunge.  I do NOT find them to be compromised at all, they appear to be in the entirety. This is one of the most cleverly written series, if not THE most clever one ever--I LOVE how the stories often play out in irony or do a full-circle type of thing, so detail is important for this show, can't lop any footage off.  In nearly every episode, Maverick gets into trouble, and has to use his wits to get out of the situation, and usually comes out ahead financially too.  So he typically starts the episode flush with cash, loses it due to robbery or trickery of some sort, but then dreams up a clever scheme to get it all back.  Season 2 the series was going full-steam, and many good stories are here.  Well worth the money spent, will be glad to put the old video tapes to rest now.",1464307200,3,1355,4.184615384615385

I think this TV series put James Garner a popular star and he was one of my favorite actors forever!  I enjoyed his TV shows in the Rockford Files too!  I think the reproduction of these episodes are in good quality and don't remember any flaws.  Most TV series were in Black and White back then because that's what most of us had back then!

5538718,5,B00B00HUC0,By the second season James Garner and Jack Kelly fully understood their roles and the writers were in full swing.  The result is arguably the finest of the Golden Age of TV Adult Westerns.  They are as funny and as exciting now as they were then!,1404259200,2,246,4.326086956521739
5538719,5,B00B00HUC0,"Both Season 1 and 2 came together.  They were on time and were packed well in superb condition.  The episodes were some of my favorites from the ""old days"".  Too bad there aren't more show like this one today!",1404172800,2,209,4.3076923076923075
5538720,5,B00B00HUC0,Although I was 10 years old when Maverick first appeared I have few concrete memories of shows I saw. What a revelation this box set has been. So far this season has been better than the first!,1402358400,,193,4.243243243243243
5538721,3,B00B00HUC0,"Unlike the first season, the menu system on these DVD's does not work well on my Blue Ray.  It will not remember the settings or which episode it is on, and sometimes does the unexpected.  The first season does not have this problem, but the menu system on it was a little different.

Some of these episodes are really great, some are a little odd, and some are eh!  Overall, some of the best TV ever made.",1402185600,,406,4.233766233766234
5538722,5,B00B00HUC0,"Bart and Bret are really charismatic and enjoyable.  Beau (Roger Maverick) does not come across as well, but he probably felt the same way, that is why he left the show.  I think the second season is the best by far.  Brent (Robert Colbert) just does not come anywhere near the class acts Bret and Bart are, and Beau is James Bond and that is that.",1402012800,2,348,4.242424242424242

My wife and I just finished the first season and have watched the first two of the second. The second season opener was terrific. I think it signaled a move in the direction of comedy.

The quality of the video is remarkably good. It is an interesting look at TV at that stage of its evolution.",1398470400,,409,4.1
5538725,5,B00B00HUC0,Maverick is one of the great old Western TV series. We are glad to see it available on DVD. Clear sound and picture!,1397692800,2,116,4.086956521739131

5538727,5,B00B00HUC0,"I hope many new fans dive into the adventures of the Maverick brothers, now that they are finally out on DVD.  The writing in these shows is smart, witty, and fun.  One is even a send-up of the R.B. Sheridan play, THE RIVALS!  This season also features and episode in which two locomotives hit head on, a spectacular effect rarely seen.  There are several episodes that turn some classic Western conventions on their head, including one with a very young Cling Eastwood.",1396828800,,470,4.695121951219512

5538734,5,B00B00HUC0,James Garner and Jack Kelly are back for another great season.  This season they added a new theme song and stopped having the actors introduce the other guy's episodes.  The picture is in very good shape and the stories are very good.  A good buy if you like comedy or westerns.,1392076800,,279,4.431372549019608

5538737,4,B00B00HUC0,This is a western that both I and my husband always liked. It is good to see an old western that is fun to watch. It has mostly humor and just easy to watch.,1390348800,,157,3.6470588235294117
5538738,5,B00B00HUC0,You can never go wrong with the Maverick TV series. Great storyline with lots of twists and turns.  Great acting from two most charismatic actors.  Good quality production and direction comparable to a movie production done way back in 1957.  Highly recommended.,1389916800,,262,5.190476190476191
5538739,5,B00B00HUC0,This year they added Jack Kelly to play brother Bart and while he did not have the charm of James Garner as Bret he did become a solid part of the series and there is still enough of Bret to make it worthwhile.,1389744000,,210,3.9069767441860463
5538740,5,B00B00HUC0,This was a gift that arrived on time.  The recipient seemed pleased.  I personally have this collection and I enjoy the Maverick brothers immensely.  I recommend this to anyone who remembers the life and times of Bret and Bart.,1389744000,,227,4.769230769230769
5538741,5,B00B00HUC0,"Waited forever for this series to come out. I bought season #1 and #2. When other seasons are on the same type disc and at a reasonable price, I will purchase them, I'm use to waiting. These are your basic view formats, which I prefer, put the darn thing in, choose your title and play. I never use any of that other stuff like someone telling me what I'm watching or the history of blah, blah, blah.",1389657600,,400,4.207792207792208
5538742,5,B00B00HUC0,Maverick is a great series for all ages. The good guys always outsmart the bad guys. Each generation needs heroes to make them think about the struggle between Right and Wrong and Maverick does it while being very entertaining.,1389052800,,227,4.846153846153846
5538743,5,B00B00HUC0,"Maverick and James Garner were unbeatable. It""s a shame Garner quit after the third season. I did like Roger Moore as cousin Beau however. The fifth season with Jack Kelly was not much good.",1388016000,,190,4.617647058823529
5538744,5,B00B00HUC0,I really like the show and I am very glad that the show is available would like to see more seasons add it on later this coming year.,1388016000,,133,3.7857142857142856
5538745,5,B00B00HUC0,"Maverick was a show full of fun, excitement, suspense and romance(s).  I like both James Garner AND Jack Kelly.  This second season has several guest stars that we didn't see in the first season.  Some of them include: Dan Blocker, Robert Conrad, Clint Eastwood, Myrna Fahey, Abby Dalton, Richard Long (Gentleman Jack Darby), etc.

The quality is very good for a 55-year old season.  The episodes continue to be enjoyable, just as in the first season.",1387497600,2,451,4.881578947368421
5538746,5,B00B00HUC0,"I would highly recommend this second season. Brett and bart have come into their own as the series starts to mature and fall into a great routine. Ny favorite episode was the complete goof on Gunsmoke that included kitty saying 'be careful Matt' at least half a dozen times.
I am sorry they screwed up the third season, with the DVD-R problem and outrageous price, but this second season was worth its weight in gold",1387497600,3,416,4.56
5538747,5,B00B00HUC0,"Over fifty years ago I enjoyed Maverick on the 21 inch black and white TV. It might be a nostalgia kick, but I still enjoy it - ,much larger screen, still black and white (thank goodness!) and still highly entertaining - better than much of the current run of television drama!",1387411200,2,277,4.450980392156863

5538749,5,B00B00HUC0,"This is an awesome set for devotees of the show.  I was just a youngster when I first recall watching Maverick.  It was the humor I remember most.  The show were a who's who of up and coming TV stars as well as established actors.  The plots were usually a lot of fun, without taking things too seriously.  The production values were great although there plenty use of stock footage.  There is one episode, which I won't name, that actually features footage from ""Casablanca"" as a cantina.  Jack Kelly and James Garner were well cast as the brothers who lived by the deck and not the gun.",1384992000,2,588,4.4392523364485985

5538752,5,B00B00HUC0,"I watched the television series ""Maverick"" regularly with my father from ages 4 to 9 around 1957 to 1962. I didn't remember anything about the episodes. I just remember that my father (now dead 24 years) and I really enjoyed them.

A couple of months ago, I bought Season One on DVD. I started watching them and really enjoyed them. My wife, who hates Westerns, sat through an episode. I expected her to dislike it, but after one was over, she asked to see another. After that, she was hooked and we watched all 26 episodes together. I immediately ordered the Second Season and we spent a very pleasant 26 straight evenings, watching one episode each evening.

She asked me to order Season 3 and was as disappointed as I am to find out that Season Three is not yet out. We watched a few of the best episodes over again, as we both went into withdrawal.
Please, people at Warner Brothers, bring out Season Three.

As for the Bret and Bart controversy, I thought in Season One, the vast majority of James Garner episodes were better than the Jack Kelley episodes, There were two or three good Kelly episodes towards the end of the Season. ""Savage Hills"" (episode 20 of Season One) with Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford was Kelly's breakout episode. I felt he really started to relax and develop his own character in this episode. In Season Two, it was pretty pretty much even. They both had about eight strong episodes and four weaker episodes. I thought the episodes they were in together, ""Sunny Deal at Shady Acres,"" and ""Game of Chance"" were the two best episodes of the season.",1380240000,5,1583,4.586572438162544

5538754,5,B00B00HUC0,"I have absolutely enjoyed this Season 2 set!  Unlike many,  I don't care about a lot of fluffy extras.  I want these older series in season sets with complete episodes.  And that is exactly what this set delivers.

It brings back a lot of good memories of sitting with my Dad watching MAVERICK on Sunday afternoons when the show was rerun on a local station when I was in Jr. High.

The writing remains strong, the list of guest stars that later became stars, production values for the time this show was produced are all top notch!

Thanks, WB!!!",1379116800,3,547,4.4646464646464645

5538757,5,B00B00HUC0,"Roy Huggins, long before bringing us The Rockford Files, and The Fugitive, he brought a particular delight to viewers from Warner Bros. Television -- Maverick, which made James Garner a star, brought us witty, intelligently written plays, wonderfully performed by the seasoned character actors of the time..a true gem! Revisiting the first and second seasons on DVD permits us to enjoy the charm the show had, before contract disputes between Garner and Warners Bros., reduced the show to a rotating series of guest stars rather than permitting us to revel in Garners wit and charm.",1377993600,3,582,5.136842105263158

5538762,5,B00B00HUC0,"James Garner sort of went his own way with what he wanted to portray from the west.

5538766,5,B00B00HUC0,"After a long wait, the first two seasons of""Maverick"" are now on DVD.  The first two seasons are among the finest in television, much less westerns.  Amidst the plethora of TV westerns at that time, Roy Huggins (creator and producer of ""Maverick"") came out with this gem of a character, as much at home in a dusty cowtown as in a royal gaming salon...wherever there was a poker game.  The show boasts a variety of writers, from Louis L'Amour to Robert Louis Stevenson and deals with some advanced subjects like adultery, child abuse and sexuality, unheard of topics in the whitewashed world of early TV .  Even the Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) episodes are superior, though some people discount them as 'lesser' shows.  Alas, Roy Huggins took severely ill at the end of season two, and without his guiding hand the show fell apart.  Bret Maverick became a buffoon (and in fact James Garner left the series after season 3) and the scripts became more mundane, lacking the cleverness and sharpness of the early shows.  Although the show continued for 5 seasons, it never matched the quality of the first two seasons.",1375488000,3,1112,4.760416666666667

5538768,5,B00B00HUC0,"I had loved Maverick years ago, but I just had no idea how fine this work was until I revisited it on Amazon Instant Video. The often-droll stories make you feel like you're reading a real page-turner; Garner's acting as Bret Maverick is amazingly relaxed and versatile considering he was pretty new to the game; the B&W photography is magnificent. Jack Kelly brings an edgier, more grimacy persona to Bart Maverick but the two contrast well and seem to be having a great time when they share episodes. This is a great show to curl up with and relax. A classic.",1375056000,5,561,4.564356435643564

The people like myself who were dying to buy these for the last 30 years are now just... well, dying off. But perhaps we can all purchase these and be so happy to see these great actors in the shows that defined them as stars that our younger relatives will watch them to see what we are fussing about.  You won't have a problem with these - Bret, Bart, and the writers all hit their stride in this season of fun shows! This season has some of the best known Maverick episodes with 'Gun-Shy' and 'Shady Deal at Sonny Acres' leading the pack!

And we can all be thankful that they aren't stringing us along with those despised 'half season' sets that so many of the late 1950's series adopted - this is Season Two in its entire",1373932800,,813,4.2387096774193544

5538783,5,B00B00HUC0,"Maverick (in my opinion) was the most unique western series ever produced.  There were other classic western series such as Cheyenne, Bonanza and for the young at heart The Lone Ranger.  But Maverick was different then all previous and subsequent cowboy series.  The brothers Maverick were reasonably honorable, but still self centered especially when money was involved.  They made their living as gamblers and shunned hard work, which was certainly a departure from previous western series and movies.  Maverick was often very funny and still had a good deal of action included.  The beauty of Maverick was it could be both enjoyed as a takeoff on westerns and as a regular cowboy series.  The acting was superb with James Garner and Jack Kelly as Bret and Bart Maverick.  Roger Moore would later appear as their Cousin Bo in some fine episodes.  This series  features many fine character co-stars (Dianne Brewster as Samantha Crawford for example.) as well, who were on a par with the brothers  when it came to trickery and money schemes.  What I also really like is that Warner Brothers finally left the opening prologues in all the episodes and in many cases their original opening credits as well.  They also did this with the latest season of The Cheyenne Show and for old series fans this adds so much more flavor.  The quality of the discs are very good and the second season episodes may be the series best overall.  I look forward to the 3rd. season of Maverick and the 6th. season of Cheyenne.

5538797,5,B00B00HUC0,"Warners has two divisions releasing DVDs and Blu-Rays, and sometimes it's like a Maverick gamble trying to figure out which release is coming from which section.

Maverick, Season 2 on DVD has apparently a broader appeal than, say, Cheyenne, which is another Warners Western series from the 1950s into the '60s. Cheyenne is released through their Warner Archives; Maverick through Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group. I think I have that right. I screwed it up once in writing to them, so we'll see.

Both shows are from their library of TV series that brought Warner Bros. into the television arena. Shows like Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip were major league hits for the third network, ABC, at the time, and those shows, along with Walt Disney, helped make them a contender against NBC and CBS.

Season 2 of Maverick is the series at the top of their game. The distinctive tone of Maverick is more clearly defined than in Season 1. If Cheyenne played by Clint Walker is the iconic, soft-voiced, Gary Cooper film persona of the cowboy of integrity and loyalty, the Maverick brothers are essentially Cheyenne's opposite; they are gamblers, their only real religion is the luck of the draw or outmaneuvering those that would cheat them. There are no better examples of this than in this newest set, packaged nicely, with good cover art of Bret and Bart with cards and chips in their hands.

Maverick, Season 2 has all 26 episodes, the story telling uncut, selling at a reasonable price.

(Side question: How did they get away with 26 episodes when most TV series at the time were producing a staggering number 39. 2nd side question: If they were going to do 39, how'd they come up with that number, why not an even 40?)

5538798,5,B00B00HUC0,James Garner is one of my favorite actors and Maverick was my favorite television series when I was young. The opportunity to view the complete second season without commercials is great.,1369094400,2,187,5.064516129032258
5538799,5,B00B00HUC0,"Season 2 has some of the best written episodes of the series. When Warner's realized what a hit they had, they put more money into production:  e.g., customizing sound effects for Garner's comic roles.  And creating the Maverick theme-song.  Garner correctly predicted the production staff breakup after the 3rd season:  Marion Hargrove & 2 other original writers split with Roy Huggins, the original exec producer & creator, who also wrote or co-wrote a lot of scripts, tho Warner's ""property-ownership rules"" forced Huggins not to receive credit.

When do we get season 3 ?",1368662400,9,575,5.139784946236559
5538800,3,B00B00HUC0,"I must be the only one it seems not to give this series top marks. Having first ordered Season 2 , I have now viewed the first disc and was not happy. No problem with the  transfers but the scripts are rubbish. The second episode is mostly talk and the last two episodes are rather boring. Most of the filming is done cheaply inside the studio. The desert scenes especially, just sand on a studio floor.  I foolishly made the mistake of ordering season 1 as well . My rememberance of Maverick appears to be very much  distorted by time. No more of this series for me.

PS.
Have now viewed more of this series and still of the same opinion. Unimagintive scripts, Bret and Bart having money stolen or getting tangled with women, very little action for a western. Good actors gone to waste.",1368662400,4,792,4.410958904109589
5538801,5,B00B00HUC0,"My husband and I are long time fan's of Maverick, the series and already have Season 1. Season 2 is a continuation of the two Maverick brothers, Bret played by James Gardner and Bart, played by Jack Kelly gambling their way across the old wild west.  Each episode involves one or both of the brothers.  From flim-flams, winning money, losing money, quoting wise old sayings from their ole pappy and having a thousand dollar bill pinned to the inside of their coat pocket for emergencies, each episode remains memorable.  You may even notice an actor or actress in a small role who later went on to become a star.  This series didn't take itself so seriously and remains enjoyable to this day. Even though it is dated, good actors and good scripting make this series a good buy even if you've never watch it before.  You won't be disappointed if you bought it now.  The black and white episodes are clear and in good quality on each DVD.  Now if it came out in bluray, it'd be perfect.",1368230400,4,984,4.49438202247191

5538806,5,B00B00HUC0,"There about fifty legitimate candidates for the list of greatest television episodes of all time: ""Abysinnia, Henry"",(MASH) {""Opie The Birdman"",(The Andy Griffith Show) ""Sweet Prince of Delancy Street"",(Naked City) ""Arrival"" ( LOST), ""Postmodern Prometheus""( The X-files) "" Who Do You Kill?"", (East Side West -Side), ""Fall-Out"" (The Prisoner), ""Women Do Not Weep"" ( Upstairs Downstairs)five or six Twilight Zones, three or four Alfred Hitchcock's, ""They're Tearing Down Pete Reilly's Bar,(Night Gallery)  and more obscure candidates such as,  ""Rally Around Your Own Flag, Mister"", And ""Question: Do you Remember The Dark Sins of Youth?""(Slattery's People) ""The Last Testament  Of Buddy Crown"" and ""A Bang And A Whimper""(Channing),and ""Incident With An Executioner"",(Rawhide) ""Noon Wine"" ( Sam Peckinpah  directed this dazzling episode of an ABC anthology Series whose name  I forget.and a about two dozen others.
Undoubtedly, this episode -and three or four other Mavericks- must be on ANY serious list. This is the quintessential Maverick,  Brett Maverick is cheated by a clever-and crooked- banker ( superbly played by the great John Dehner) Then he goes to the telegraph office, and sends a series of  messages to almost all the usual suspects- Dandy Jim Buckley,(Efrem Zimbalist,Jr.), Gentleman Jim Darby, (Richard Long), Big Jim McComb, (Leo Gordon), Brother Bart, and several of the ladies. Then he sits back and whittles while a con game of sheer  genius unfolds, with John Dehner as the victim. Dehner's character is no fool, and he almost catches on at one point, but his greed and vanity betray  him. Magnificent!",1366934400,21,1623,5.434262948207171
