2378256,4,B000A7DW7Q,"While the first season of Law & Order SVU had its moments, it pales in comparison to the rest of the series' run. I too don't understand why Universal released Season 5 after Season 1, but when I discovered that Season 2 was finally out, I scooped it right up because that's the point where the show went from good to great.

What really made the show better was the addition of three actors: Stephanie March as ADA Alexandra Cabot, Ice-T as Detective Odafin ""Fin"" Tutuola, and B.D. Wong as psychiatrist Dr. George Huang (even though he wasn't too likable initially). I knocked a star off my rating because I didn't care for the episodes ""Asunder"" or ""Abuse"", but overall, everything is impressive. This show is so successful that it even surpassed the original Law & Order in popularity. What does that tell you? While you're waiting for your copy of this to come in the mail, catch new episodes of SVU on NBC or reruns on USA.

2378257,4,B000A7DW7Q,"The Law & Order franchise is second only to the Simpsons to be the longest running television show.  Through its success, the police drama has spawned three similar productions that crossover into different realms of the criminal world and guardians of the law.  One of the descendants from the original series is Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, also known as SVU, which deals sensitive crimes of sexual nature.  Each episode follows the complete circle of the crime.  From the crime to the legal consequence portrayed through the eyes of the prosecutors.  However, the focus of the series seems to rest on the investigators in the SVU and their investigative work, which reveals gruesome crimes such as rape and incest.

The opening of the second season brings an episode, Wrong is Right, that possess all the intrigues necessary to continue to fascinate the audience, as it did during its initial season.  It simply continues where season one left off, as the repercussions of a psychological evaluation where two of the main characters shared their thoughts and actions.  Detective Stabler's (Christopher Meloni) work begins to drastically affect his personal life, as his daughter witnesses a gruesome crime.  Meanwhile, Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Detective Munch (Richard Belzer) continue to work with dreadful crimes while Captain Cragen (Dann Florek) helps his squad whenever needed.  During this initial and difficult episode of SVU, Detective Tutuola (Ice-T) arrives after having been transferred from the narcotics department.

The first episode helps set up the rest of the season, which ends with the season finale where a serial killer is on the loose.  Every episode in between also contains grisly themes such as stalkers, child molesters, and prostitution among many other crimes that fall under the SVU jurisdiction.  All episodes present some level of discomfort, as the audience gets to experience how the main characters reacted to the crimes and how they confront these crimes.  The SVU is the most controversial of Law & Order's off-shoot, which with its dreadful themes attracts attention to why people commit such ghastly crimes.  It also provides an interesting perspective on the human psyche, as it affects the characters in the series.  Ultimately, the second season of SVU presents a very good experience that provides suspense and drama.

Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year is a terrific television series that offers some light on a segment of the police profession that most people desire not to hear about.  Nonetheless, NBC has been brave enough to create a TV series that discusses the dreadfulness of sex crimes in a clever and lawful manner.  Those initiated to SVU should know that this show is definitely worth a viewing, as each episode will provide something new and ghastly.  Yet, awareness could maybe help these crimes from surfacing and prevention could maybe be a little easier, as understanding for the victims is augmented through this excellent television show.",1129852800,18,3043,5.19672131147541
2378258,5,B000A7DW7Q,"When will the third season of SVU be released????? This show is so great and loved by millions of people all over the world, I just don't why it is taking so long to release season 3 and 4 of SVU.  One question I have is why did they skip all the way to season 5 of SVU????? It just don't make since to go from season 1 and then bypass seasons 2, 3, and 4 and go straight to season 5.  Please hurry up and release the other seasons.",1129852800,3,432,3.7888888888888888
2378259,5,B000A7DW7Q,"Law and Order, Special Victims Unit, outshines most all drama series in television. The suspense is thrilling which more than ikely will have hanging off the edge of your seat before each and every commercial break. The overall plot itself is outstanding. The characters make it even better. I really enjoy these pisodes every time I watch them, which is usually every other day. This series well deserves 6 stars but ince the limit is 5- I'll have to settle.",1129420800,,459,4.75
2378260,2,B000A7DW7Q,Well it seems people from Quebec (part of the dvd region 1) will be unable to watch (or read the subtitles) in their native language. This is quite unfair!,1129161600,4,155,4.379310344827586
2378261,5,B000A7DW7Q,"I love the show, and was very pleased to finally be able to see Season 2.  Unfortunately, the second disc in the set was defective (same thing for the replacement Amazon sent me).  Hopefully Universal will release a set with each disc in proper working order.  (No dust or scratches on disc 2 - it just wouldn't play, no matter what DVD player it was in.)",1128643200,10,355,4.348484848484849
2378262,5,B000A7DW7Q,"If you're just getting into SVU I would recommend starting with this set rather than season 1.  Though the series got off to a shaky start it really hit it's stride in season 2 when it developed the format that it uses today and added new characters(DA, therapist, etc.) which add a nice balance to the show and stopped focusing on Stabler's boring daughter.",1126051200,5,358,4.59375
2378263,5,B000A7DW7Q,"It's about bloody time that this season came onto DVD!  Why they released season 5 before the others is quite beyond me, but as long as the other seasons get released quickly, and allow me to complete my collection, I won't complain. One of the things that really gets me about this series isn't just the hard-hitting cases that this show tackles, but also the characters and the acting.

The season opened with Stabler's daughter witnessing a gory crime scene, and some great father/daughter scenes resulted from this episode, depicting Stabler as a caring family man, sometimes made too paranoid by his job.  Another episode that I found touching was 'Legacy', where a case of Shaken Baby Syndrome hits really close to home for Munch, played by Richard Belzer, who was originally on the series ""Homicide: Life on the Street.""  Personally, I wish that the series focused more on Munch than it currently does.  We learned a good deal about him in ""Homicide"", but since then, character development on this amazingly unique character has ground to a virtual halt, except for learning that his father killed himself, and young Munch considered himself responsible (see Season 5).

Season 2 also introduced the characters of Detective Odafin 'Fin' Tutuola, played by Ice-T, and Assistant District Attorney Alex Cabot, played by Stephanie March. Although not a series regular, Dr. George Huang also appeared several times in the second season, brilliantly acted by B.D. Wong.  This DVD set is well worth owning!

At any rate, Law & Order SVU has been, and continues to be one of the best TV series on the air in this age of cheezy, trashy reality shows which are in no way realistic.  Who wants to see a bunch of idiots dress up like Gilligan and go through with a set of ridiculous stunts?  If this is where the entertainment world is headed, I'll buy the DVD sets instead and watch those. On the upside of that? No commercials! :-)",1124668800,62,1928,4.7975830815709966

2378301,5,B000A7DW7Q,I am a late-comer to the Law & Order phenomenon.  I didn't get interested in the show until about six months ago and now I have made it through season 10. I love the plot lines and the characters on the show. I don't think you have to start with season 1 but I did find it helpful that I learned about Olivia and Elliot a lot in the first season. A part of me was worried that the plots would get redundant but they never do  Each episode has such a diverse range of supporting actors and actresses that they keep the show lively and entertaining. Definitely recommend buying the DVD series for people who have seen the series before and for those who have never seen it before.,1435276800,,678,4.207692307692308

2378356,5,B000A7DW7Q,"In the second season of Special Victims Unit we see as two detectives struggle to keep their jobs and we see a few new additions to the cast as well as recurring characters. First off there is Assistant District Attorney Alex Cabot, the first series regular from the DA's office. Every case SVU detectives close gets handed to Cabot in the DA's office Special Victims Unit. Now we see what a Sex Crimes prosecutor must go through when it's their turn to handle these sensitive cases of terrorized woman and children. Also joining the team is Detective Odafin Tutuola, a transfer from Narcotics. He eventually becomes Munch's new partner and this season is the best one that portrays their contrasting partnership. The skeptic liberal and the Narc Republican. This is my favorite Ice-T season, because I felt his character kept losing some depth every season onward except for a few the episodes that would focus on him. I sure wish he'd wear that suit again. Also there Tamara Tunie who plays Dr. Warner from time to time as a guest before becoming a regular in season 7-12. Also we see B.D Wong as Dr. George Huang from the FBI. His characteristics differs much in his first appearance form later ones. This season is what the show should have been about. The detectives investigating this vicious felonies and their lives on and off the job. Captain Cragen seemed like he used his authority a bit more prominently than in latter seasons, pointing out his Detectives' flaws and putting them in their place when they go out of line. He treats them with respect but he expects them to follow his orders as well as those above him in the chain of command. You can see as this show starts off as what it was when left at season 1 and slowly turn into the show Neal Baer has made it in the 11 seasons during his time as showrunner. The season opener is probably the best in the series until seasons 13 and 14 and I would most likely put it in a list of the top 5 openers in the Law & Order franchise. The second year is everything you've came to expect from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and more. This is a must-have for every SVU fan and Law & Order fan as well.",1361145600,3,2164,4.4534005037783375

MAKES A GREAT COLLECTION.  I  NOW HAVE THEM ALL.",1353024000,,109,4.35
2378363,4,B000A7DW7Q,"I don't really like any of the other Law & Orders.  Can't tell you why either.  Maybe its the characters, maybe the plots aren't as heartbreaking, I just never took to them.  But I really enjoy Law and Order: SVU despite the fact that it deals with some very hard topics.

Law & Order SVU deals with the hard cases in New York.  Those cases of child abuse, rape, and violence against the elderly.  Because of the sensitive nature it requires a special force of detectives to investigate these crimes.  Season Two begins where Season One left off, with Detective Jeffries being removed from the force and Stabler's service called into question.  Like the first season, each episode could be considered a stand alone (with a few exceptions) in that a case is solved in each one.  There are some side plots that are continued through the whole season and from the first, but these are more to do with the reoccurring characters than with the plots within the episodes.  There are a few episodes that do rely on previous ones though.  One of these details a man who is a serial rapist in the episode Closure.  It brings back a victim from the first season who wants to try to get her rapist put behind bars, and isn't afraid to follow him to do it.  One of my favorite episodes from this season is Pixies.  It deals with gymnasts training for the Olympics and it's horrifying and inspiring all at once.  Not even thinking about the grisly crime in the episode, it opens up a world of gymnastics and Olympics that I wouldn't have even thought about.

Characters:
Christopher Meloni: Elliot Stabler
Mariska Hargitay: Olivia Benson
Richarld Belzer: John Munch
Michelle Hurd: Monique Jeffries
Ice-T: Fin Tutuola
Stephanie March: Alexandra Cabot
Dann Florek: Don Cragen
B.D. Wong: George Huang

There are many many characters in the Law and Order universe; but the ones listed above are those that show up in nearly every episode (with the exception of B.D. Wong who becomes a permanent character towards the end of this season).  And it's the characters that make this show.  There's only so much gory satisfaction a human being can get out of watching depravity; don't let it be questioned that most people watch this show because the cast of characters is excellent.  Meloni and Hargitay really work well together and it makes their union as Benson and Stabler seem realistic; like partners who really can work together.  Florek as Captain Cragen is what holds the whole team together with his calm personality.  And Munch and Fin are the comic relief, although they too can have a serious side to them.  Stephanie March comes in as ADA Cabot who prosecutes the cases for SVU and assists them with warrants and other legal matters and she's a kind of no-nonsense person that deep down has a good heart.  It's hard to warm up to her, but you eventually do.  And then there's B.D. Wong as Dr. George Huang, a psychiatrist who helps with the cases as well.  It's hard to picture Wong, who prances around in Father of the Bride as a serious doctor type, but he does it admirably well.  And while I like his fun side, he is very very good at what he does on SVU.

A very good series and this one comes off a lot more polished than the first.  The characters fit into their roles better, the plots are edgier, and there aren't many episodes that I would suggest skipping.  There are a few that are somewhat lackluster, or the plot progressed slowly on, but the majority are edge of your seat you have to know what happens type of episodes.  The camera work was better too, not quite as choppy and it highlighted the detectives when they were on the case.  Of course there is violence, being that this is a cop show and it does cover hard topics, so parental discretion is advised.

If you've never seen SVU give it a try (and start at the first season)!

2378364,3,B000A7DW7Q,"Shipping of this season of Law And Order, was very good however the company that sold them here on Amazon, did not check the disks to see if they were playable and should have since these were used disks and out of six disks only four played. I also think these were not original disks as they were 3 double sided disks and had no artwork on them at all where as the box they came in did though. I did order these again from another brick and mortar company locally and that set was original with six disks all with artwork on them. I am not saying that the ""Law And Order: Special Victims Unit The Second Year"" I received the first time were illegal copies just that they were probably re-prints and very poorly made ones at that. I also want to thank Amazon, for completely understanding my situation and for refunding my purchase in full even the cost of shipping was refunded. Thank you very much again Amazon, your one great company. I was going to give this seller only one star but decided on three for effort and the fact that I received a full refund.",1346025600,,1060,4.305

2378367,5,B000A7DW7Q,"This spin-off of the original ""Law & Order"" series is well worth the watching. The plots, interesting in and of themselves, have enough twists to keep even the most jaded detective story fan interested.  I expect to be watching this series for years to come.",1313798400,,258,4.733333333333333
2378368,5,B000A7DW7Q,"Ok so the double-sided disks took a bit of getting used to but it wasn't worth knocking a star off the score. And since they played without any difficulty whatsoever I definitely feel it's worth 5 stars.
  Season two of SVU picks up right where the season one cliffhanger ended. In Wrong is Right, Stabler's daughter Maureen accidentally catches a horrifying glimpse of a recently murdered man whose body appeared to have been set on fire. Meanwhile, Captain Cragen is faced with the consequences of the psychologist's recommendation. We are first introduced to Odafin (Fin) Tutuola, Munch's more or less permanent partner,, in this episode. In Honor, the detectives find themselves investigating the rape/murder of an Afghan diplomat's daughter, during which they discover certain dictates of Taliban beliefs that condone honor killings if a child goes against the wishes of his or her family. In Closure part 2, Harper Anderson, the rape victim from part 1, disgusted by the SVU's failure to convict him, decides to follow her accused rapist, ultimately with devastating consequences. In Baby Killer, the SVU investigates the shooting death of a young girl on a school playground. in Legacy, the SVU investigates a family when their comatose daughter is brought into the hospital. With at least two possible suspects, the detectives ultimately crack the case to a disturbing revelation. In Noncompliance, the investigation into the rape/murder of a young woman turns into a heated debate about patients' rights when the prime suspect, a young Schizophrenic man, refuses to take medication. In Taken, the SVU investigates the rape of agirl during the festivities celebrating the opening of a luxury hotel. But as they dig for further information, the truth they discover reveals that the situation is far from what it appears.
  Other standout episodes include Pixies, in which a young gymnast is found raped and murdered, and the SVU find themselves contending with multiple suspects including the girls' strict trainer, a wealthy benefactor who seemed to have a special thing for the victim and one of her competitors, this last seemingly having a personal grudge against her. In Consent, the investigation into the rape of a young colege student and the subsequent discovery that she had a homemade date rape drug in her system turns into a debate about what constitutes consent. In Abuse, the tragic death of the son of two famous singers sparks an investigation into whether or not their young daughter is being abused by her parents. Unfortunately, the girl's parents, not liking their daughter's attachment to one of the SVU detectives, take out a restraining order against the entire unit. In Paranoia, Benson's former mentor is raped and the crime is first linked to her x husband's gambling debts and then to her fellow officers. In Countdown, the detectives race against time to save an abducted girl from a serial killer who kills his victims on the third day. In Manhunt, the detectives investigate the recent abduction of a waitress and are reminded of a series of unsolved rapes and murders with a disturbingly similar Motus Operandi. In Pique, the SVU must investigate the stabbing death of a software company employee with the help of Dr. George Huang, an FBI agent and psychology expert who subsequently becomes an invaluable asset to the team. The trail leads to a fired colleague and a disturbing truth about the nature of his relationship with his overbearing mother. The season ends with Scourge, in which the detectives must track down a serial killer who justifies his actions with religious paranoia, which they discover was brought on by a rapidly deteriorating medical condition. This of course complicates matters since it forces not only the SVU detectives themselves but ADA Kabot as well to make the difficult decision of whether to administer the death penalty in response to public opinion or honor the request of a mother and her children.
  Also included on this DVD set is a short Sesame Street sketch in which some of the SVU detectives take a break from catching rapists to track down the missing letter M. Of course each disk also features deleted scenes from the episodes it contains. So once again, an excellent season. Of course there's no shortage of cast interviews, all of wich are extremely interesting. Needless to say, I can't wait to get my grubby little paws on the rest of the series.",1307059200,2,4436,5.036784741144414

This series focuses on sexual crimes, normally not dealt with on television. The main crimes are rape, child molestation, and everything in between. I am very glad the Law and Order series decided to tackle this once taboo topic and I believe this series has helped open the discussion of rape and sexual abuse which is one of the reasons why I love this series so much.

The acting is great, the plots are amazing and draw in you from the first ""dum dum"". Since it deals with sensitive subject matter, the episodes may not be appropriate for all viewers. There is high replayability with these episodes which is why it is worth the purchase.

This is, obviously, a bad batch coming from Universal. Sadly, I will, once again, have to return this set to Amazon. This time I'm going to ask for a refund.

For all you ""techies"" out there who think the problem is mine, please note the following: The disk was played back on a brand new PANASONIC DMR-ES25S DVD player/recorder, and SONY ""Pro-line"" DVD player. It was also tried on a MAC G-5. Nothing worked, and the same results were realized.

Until Universal gets their quality control act together, I'm going to have to pass on this one. Hopefully, Amazon.com will put out a notice about this problem (like they did with the second Beatles box set & its first release with incorrect mixes).

As for the rest of the set, it's great. However, why buy a box set if you can't enjoy ALL the extras? Sorry folks...but this gets only ONE star!

Buyer beware!!! It's not Amazon's fault - it's UNIVERSAL'S!!!",1152748800,2,1235,4.779342723004695

2378399,5,B000A7DW7Q,"Another great season of Law & Order's first spinoff.  I have enjoyed this season the most of all 3 DVD releases (out of 1, 2 & 5).  Despite no Dolby Digital 5.1 and more disappointing, NO WIDESCREEN.... The content of the stories, the characters, and the Law & Order formula has made this a great buy.

NOW THEN,

With the Law & Order franchise showing no signs of slowing down, and still being way behind in DVD releases (L&O needs to release seasons 5-13 & 15 / SVU needs 3,4 & 6 / and Criminal Intent needs 2 & 4) WHERE ARE SEASONS 3 & 4 of SVU?

And when they are released, do yourselves and all of us a favor...release it in WIDESCREEN and DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1!!!",1143504000,3,665,4.1640625
2378400,5,B000A7DW7Q,Excellent follow up to season 1. Ice - T and Stephanie March as well as B.D. Wong are excellent additions to the 2nd season. When is Season 3 coming out?,1143244800,,153,4.133333333333334
2378401,5,B000A7DW7Q,"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is the best show on TV.  Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni rock, as well as Ice-T, Richard Belzer, Dann Florek, Tamara Tunie, B. D. Wong, and Diane Neal (and yes, I know all these names by heart).  I haven't bought these DVD's yet, but I definitely intend to, as I haven't watched this series from its beginning (dang it).  For those of you who are wondering why seasons 1, 2, and 5 are out and not 3 and 4, here is my guess:  I think it is because Universal (or whoever does the DVD production of it) does not have the rights to those episodes, because it is still being shown on cable television.  I know, I know, I am also a big fan and would like to see it on DVD as well.  But this is just my guess.",1141948800,,746,4.075342465753424

I also liked the price. I went to Tower Records and found that they were selling this product for $59.99! That is just OUTRAGEOUS! I'm glad that I found it here on Amazon instead of spending all that money. But like I said, I really enjoyed the episodes and I'm glad that there are shows like these.",1141344000,,467,4.142857142857143
