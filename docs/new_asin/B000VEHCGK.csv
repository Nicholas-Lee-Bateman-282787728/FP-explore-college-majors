8269967,5,B000VEHCGK,"Shot on a shoestring in the countryside, SELVI BOYLUM AL YAZMALIM is an
acknowledged classic of Turkish cinema. The plot is straightforward
enough: village girl Asya (Turkan Soray) falls in love with itinerant
truck-driver Ilyas (Kadir Inanir). They get (unofficially) married and
have a child, but Ilyas cannot adjust to life as a husband and seeks
solace elsewhere. Asya leaves home for good, and is left alone on the
road until Good Samaritan Cemsit (Ahmet Mekin) takes her in. After a
whole, during which time Cemsit proves a good father to Asya's son
Samet, the two get married. However Ilyas returns quite unexpectedly to
the scene, forcing Asya to make a choice between past and present
lives. Yilmaz's direction is straightforward; while allowing the plot
to unfold at a cracking pace, he uses the shot/reverse strategy to
powerful effect, especially at the end. The three central performances
are just brilliant: Soray and Inanir were never better during their
entire careers as the ill-fated couple, while Mekin has a wonderful
talent for showing repressed emotion in a single expression. SELVI
BOYLUM AL YAZMALIM has proved highly influential: the 2012 films ARAF
and GOZETLEME KULESI both have sequences borrowed from the film.",1374883200,4,1239,5.2
