8297992,2,B001EGG5QM,"Sports competition, smoking pot (lots of smoking pot), and boring humor that's more cliche than offensive. So much of the humor has been done too much in too many other films to produce anything greater than a yawner: metrosexual, rapper, feminism, homophobia, and older guys with younger gals humor put me to sleep (lots of sleep). Our two main characters are has been snowboarders whose fifteen minutes of fame ended fifteen minutes earlier and the concept of losers beating out business models has run its course (pun intended), especially in this movie. The two annoying wannabe white rappers made me want to puke (can we say unoriginal?). Why did I give this movie 2 stars? The location shots were visually exhilarating. One star. The snowboarding was awesome. One star. Cheech and Chong, Animal House, Hot Dog the Movie, Half Baked and American Pie were superior flicks that covered all of this ground better; you've seen this movie several times before. Snowboarding and location are the only reasons to check this one out.",1288915200,2,1030,4.994186046511628
