1202280,1,B00000F4W8,"Bogart is cloned, but so what? It could have been great. In addition to finding Bogart's exact double, they managed some pretty impressive cameos such as Mike Mazurky who just five years before, played a Moose Malloy that would have made Chandler proud. But the script abuses EVERY CLICHE and not ONE joke hits its mark. Worse, the script is bloated with endless movie references. Some that appear to be put there without even the slightest bit of cause given that they aren't even films noir.

  I haven't liked any of the recent parodies of noir on film. Especially since they all seem to rely on the similiar plot devices. ""The Singing Detective"" and ""Girl a Car and a Blonde"" rely on the identical device that escaping into a noir world helps the protagonist escape a painful medical condition.

  Thankfully, ""Man with Bogart's Face"" does not fall into this trap, but that doesn't improve it much. For better or worse, we must be given Sam Marlow's motivation for assuming his role as a Bogie clone, and we are not.

  This movie has more in common with ""Umney's Last Case,"" Stephen King's miserable failure at creating noir in his collection ""Nightmare's and Dreamscapes"" in that both King and Andrew J.Fenady (the screenwriter) think that if you can cram in enough references to the classics you will be given instant crediblity. This is not the case. My suggestion for alternative to renting this film is that you rent the real thing. Particularly ""Maltese Falcon"" and for an even better version of the cool funhouse scene in ""Man with Bogart's Face,"" rent ""The Lady from Shanghai.

  Alas, as I'm a sucker for everything noir I will probably continue to seek out these types of films. Next on my list is ""The Black Bird"" which I hope is an abler spoof of The Maltese Falcon"". That and ""Radioactive Dreams""",1104710400,,1814,4.723809523809524
1202281,4,B00000F4W8,"Fun to see Mike Mazurky, Henry Wilcoxon, and George Raft in bit parts.  Fun to see Robert Saachi do a spot-on impersonation of Bogart.  The best unplanned fun is viewing the cheesy 70s TV-movie values that add to the nostalgia of the film.",1052006400,,239,4.534883720930233
1202282,2,B00000F4W8,"5 stars to the actor playing bogie,he has the voice,look, manors and style PERFECT. however the golden age of movies did not have curse words & naked women and i really doubt the real bogie would have lowered himself to this stupid script. If you are the ultimate bogart fan,like me, you can apprechiate just how good this actor plays him and at times there are a few funny sceenes like a car crash resulting from seeing bogie back from the dead.nice hearing the this actor relate everything to the ""old days"" as he visits certain streets and area's in this film where previous old movies were shot naming the stars who were in them, you can kind of picture it in B&W in your head if you saw the films. it is also kind of neat seeing a cameo by george raft an actor who played with bogie way back when in some of the classics but this is NOT a child safe movie. You can take most of the golden age movies and watch them with a family but not this trashy comedy too many uneeded sex implied scenario's that just don't fit with the real humphrey bogart films.",1045180800,3,1057,4.263681592039801
1202283,4,B00000F4W8,"Andy Fenaday's scipt follows self-employed detective (Scacchi, who's incredible) as he gets wrapped up in a MALTESE FALCON-type mystery. Heavy doses of amusing dialog, crammed with old movie references, this movie is better than FLETCH. A lot of fun and worth repeated viewings. A must for movie buffs. Good family viewing, with older kids. Rated PG for profanity, violence, and mild sexual innuendo.",1022803200,3,400,5.365079365079365
1202284,3,B00000F4W8,"Robert Sacchi attained minor celebrity in the 70's and 80's for his uncanny resemblance to Bogie and parlayed it into a career in TV commercials and cameo movie roles, most notably in Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM.  This vehicle is built around his unique ""gift.""  It's an unremarkable but highly likable send-up of the great private eye flicks from the 30's and 40's - its most obvious inspiration being THE MALTESE FALCON, but there are allusions to THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and other classics as well. It is chock full of hard-boiled banter and shadowy frames and shadowy characters and probably would have been better shot in black and white to capture the true ambience and ambiguities of the originals it seeks to imitate.
Same Marlowe is hired to find ""the eyes of Alexander"", sapphire replicas of Alexander the Great's eyes used in a bust of the conqueror, and during the search he runs into a snag of competing interests, all played by well-known character actors, Victor Buono and Herbert Lom among them.  The plot, however, is superfluous, as it almost always is in detective films.  The real point of the movie is to pay tribute to old time movie magic, and part of its fun is in the cameos.  Apart from bit parts by the likes of George Raft, watch out for appearances by famed Hollywood reporters James Bacon and Robert Osborne as well (the latter now the host of cable's Turner Classic Movies).",989452800,4,1409,4.711382113821138
1202285,2,B00000F4W8,"Okay, Robert Saachi can't quite act.  He just barely passes off looking like Bogart.  But everybody else in the movie CAN act; more specifically, act like character archtypes from Raymond Chandler movies.
There's Victor  Buono as a Sydney Greenstreetoid, Herbert Lom as a Peter Lorreite, and  Franco Nero as a rival art collector that colors his world lavender.  Olivia Hussey plays the innocent daughter of the guy with the McGuffin (In  this case a pair of twin sapphires) and Yvonne DeCarlo...doesn't speak.  At  all.  Odd, really.  Don't blink, or you'll miss George Raft in a cameo,  only slightly longer than his ""this gun shoots backwards"" role in  Casino Royale.
It's not quite a parody, and not good enough to be a  tribute...more like Bogartmania.  Not Bogart, but an incredible  simulation.
Okay...not that incredible.",962928000,,829,5.12781954887218
1202286,5,B00000F4W8,"For me, this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  If you're a Bogart fan and  enjoy playing name that tune, you'll see references throughout this one.  Set in Los Angeles, it starts out with this Bogie look alike driving  through the suburban streets in a trench coat and hat, as though in much  colder San Francisco.  It has exactly the humor that appeals to me and  should appeal to many other viewers.  Border line politically incorrect at  places, it should be viewed not with the expectation that it will be a  thriller like one of the Sam Spade series, but with the realization that it  is meant to be a lighthearted tribute to Humphry Bogart.  I believe that  Lauren Bacall would approve heartily.",959644800,2,702,4.655737704918033
1202307,5,B00000F4W8,"We have watched this movie several times over the past ten years and enjoy it as much the second or fourth time as the first.  While a little bit of exaggeration, this movie is almost as good as Bogart's classics.",1413331200,,213,4.325

1202314,5,B00000F4W8,"This funny film is more than just another 80's comedy. Robert Sacchi is quite often during the film really Bogart. I usually turn the color off when I am watching this movie to enhance the effect. There are a few weak moments in the film, but by and large it is worth seeing many times. I have seen many Bogart impersonators (there are almost as many as Elvis impersonators), but Sacchi is by far the best. I wish Hollywood had made a serious gangster film noir in the 80's with Sacchi as Bogart. It could have worked.
This comedy has many a vignette from classic Bogart films worked into it. It has a fat Greenstreet character and a mousy Peter Lorrie type. It has the real George Raft in his last role, a fitting tribute to the gangster film era. Michelle Philips is awesome as a composite of several Bogart film love interests and at the height of her hotness. There are many references to other great classic films since ""Bogy"" is obsessed with old movies in the film. Really recommend this DVD. I wish a Blu-ray would be released.",1388448000,,1035,4.4526315789473685
1202315,4,B00000F4W8,"Our theatre group was preparing for a performance of a stage version of this story, and I thought the movie would be a valuable resource.  It was.  Although the acting is a little cheesy at times, it was a faithful rendering of the premise and the plot.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a loving spoof of the old Bogart films--and especially if you're planning to present the play.  Sacchi looks enough like Bogart that acting is almost unnecessary.",1386460800,,460,4.6419753086419755
1202316,5,B00000F4W8,This movie about a Bogart-obsessed detective who has his face altered to match the actor's and then becomes embroiled in a real-life mystery right out of an old Bogart film is a fun romp and a playful nod toward the 1940s star and his oeuvre.,1384905600,,242,4.4
1202334,4,B00000F4W8,"Not a GREAT movie, but well worth the watch and  Robert Sacchi almost makes a perfect Bogey. There is enough of the aura of the original one-and-only to keep this interesting and the story clips along rapidly. Franco Nero is fun as a villain.",1384473600,,242,4.5
1202335,5,B00000F4W8,"This is a movie about a man, who is transformed in to a Humphry Bogart  look-a-like. He opens up a private eye office, and starts a  business.

Robert Sacchi bears a striking resemblence to Humphrey Bogart.  He has many of the mannerisms of Bogey down pat.

Michelle Phillips does a very good likeness of a Gene Tierney.

Plot is a lot of fun and there are laughs aplenty at times - all intentional.",1297382400,,373,4.606060606060606
1202341,5,B00000F4W8,"You don't need to know Bogart to enjoy this movie. I had this on VHS but it broke so I purchaed the DVD and now I can enjoy it a few time a year.

1202342,4,B00000F4W8,"It's been a quite a few years since I saw this film, but it held up quite well. I first read the novel when it was published. I read it a few times, then the film came and went a few years later. I missed it in it's original release, but caught it later on at a revival house. Being that the original author Andrew J. Fenney produced this film and wrote the screenplay it stayed very faithful to the novel. Fenney who worked on the John Wayne ""HOndo"" and produced the TV series version of it is a movie buff and the novel and film are both filled with movie trivia.

When the film opens our main character has just had plastic surgery to make himself look like Humphrey Bogart (p[layed by Bogart lookalike Robert Sacchi) He assumes the name of Sam Marlow, and hires a blond secretary who by his discription, ""Looks like Marilyn Monroe and makes as much sence as Gracie Allen"", she's played by Missy Rowe, who once played Marilyn in a film. He then gets too cases, one his hired by his landlady to find her missing boyfriend, the other mystery is sort of on the order of the Maltese Falcon. After being hired by Elsa (Olivia Hussey) Borcht to protect her father Horst (Helmet Dantine) Borscht, Horst Borscht is killed. The he finds out it has to do with some missing blue Diamonds called The Eyes Of Alexander that many people want to aquire. The suspects include Mr. Zebra (Herbert Lom), who's very much a Joel Cairo type as played by Peter Lorre in ""The Maltese Falcon"". Then there is pretty Gina Anastis, who loos like Gene Tierney and is played by Michelle Phillips. She brings him to her father (Victor Buono) who is very much in the Sidney Greenstreet vain. You also have Akim (Franco Nero) in the Zachery Scot vain. Plus a delightful cameo by George Rafet as Pete Cain who in the novel is described as a George Raft type. Raft even comments that he's delt with guys who looked like Marlow before. This film is film with great old character actors and an interesting mystery.

Even though I've seen it before and read the book, my recent viewing kept me at the edge of my seat. I reccomend this film for any great old movie or mystery lover.",1257379200,,2146,4.389447236180905
1202343,5,B00000F4W8,"All Bogie fans, in fact ALL lovers of classics should see THE MAN WITH BOGART'S FACE. It stars Robert Sacchi, who is an uncanny double for Mr. B. in size, face, hair, mannerisms and voice. Watching him in this movie is like seeing Bogie alive again.

The story opens at a plastic surgeon's office. The gauze wrappings are removed from our hero's face; he sits in front of a TV that's showing the last scene of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MALTESE-FALCON/dp/B000GIXLW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MALTESE FALCON</a>. As the surgically-created Bogart examines his visage in the mirror with a characteristic twitch, we hear Bogie's famous ""you're going over/because you're partners"" soliloquy coming from the nearby television.

""Bogart's Face"" is packed with references to classic cinema, both spoken and visually. The climactic house of mirrors shootout in Orson Welles'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-LADY-FROM-SHANGHAI/dp/B00004W229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI</a>&nbsp;is reenacted at Hollywood's famous Wax Museum. Sacchi's character, hard-boiled detective Sam Marlow, talks incessantly about old films. He'll do something, like throw a sword into the ceiling, and then remark: ""Tyrone Power did that in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MARK-OF-ZORRO/dp/B000A9QK8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MARK OF ZORRO</a>.

Michelle Phillips is the woman private eye Marlow is obsessed with. He thinks of her as Gene Tierney in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LAURA/dp/B00008LDNZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LAURA</a>, in fact, he even calls her Laura one time by mistake. Marlow drives an early 40s sedan and lives in a trench coat (naturally).

Actors in the film represent those from Bogart classics, such as Victor Buono playing Sidney Greenstreet and Herbert Lom as Peter Lorre. Additionally there are old-time stars sprinkled throughout in cameos: George Raft, Yvonne DeCarlo, Mike Mazurki and Henry Wilcoxon.

In one scene, Sacchi is a stunning Bogie in his sparkling white dinner jacket. Experiencing this film is like seeing the Bogart movie that never was. I highly recommend it!

For another modern take on Humphrey Bogart, check out Woody Allen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLAY-IT-AGAIN-SAM/dp/B00005NVDF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM</a>-- the 1972 adaptation of Allen's Broadway show.
