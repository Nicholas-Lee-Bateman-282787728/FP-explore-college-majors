8374463,1,B002MZZUYM,This DVD is a total Rip Off!! I want my money back and I will try to get my money back! On the back of the DVD it says 60 min length. The DVD is about 25 min long. Completely false advertising. The 25 min of information on the DVD is TOTALLY basic and at the level of many DVD Extras. Therefor it is really just a few techniques that one might use when making an indie film. Another 35 min would have really helped this product!! Don't waste you money or your time !!,1310169600,,467,3.9263157894736844
