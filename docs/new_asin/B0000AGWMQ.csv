1906078,3,B0000AGWMQ,The sound on this DVD has a ton of background noise - like listening to a movie in the shower. Loretta Young spends a lot of time looking as beautiful as she can and David Niven is good as the Houdini type  magician. Escape artist stuff does have some tense moments. Skims over the story and by today's standards doesn't involve you enough in the characters so that you care what happens to them.,1326412800,4,396,4.351351351351352
1906079,4,B0000AGWMQ,"This is a fun movie with a bit of a serious side.  We really enjoyed watching a very young David Niven and an even younger Loretta Young.  It even has a bit of stage magic thrown in, which was almost as fun as the rest of the movie.",1276041600,9,232,3.8125
1906080,5,B0000AGWMQ,"This review is for the movie and not the format--there was not a place to review on the DVD page. Viewers have complained about the quality of the VHS, but aside from that the whole flim was shot in what I call ""soft glow"" a vaseline on the lens type effect and it does add a mysterious dream-like quality that is at times beautiful.
David Niven plays an ACE magician that enchants audiences. His Houdini-like stunts seem impossible. Loretta Young's character is his capable assistant and they have much on-stage chemistry for the audience to behold. They are very complementary to each other's needs so they get married--today, I suppose we would call that co-dependency. They have a circle of friends that include such fine character actors as Broderick Crawford, Eve Arden and Zasu Pitts filling the scenes with gay banter. Niven trys to push the limit on each new stunt, the most outlandish being his trick of jumping out of an airplane while his hands are too confined by a straightjacket and handcuffs to pull the rip cord on his chute until the very last moment. Each time he makes it back safely, nail-biting, hand-wringing Loretta makes him promise it will be the last time he does the stunt. He is addicted to pushing the limit and can't stop. Finally she walks out on him, unwilling to go through the torture any longer, and marries Broderick Crawford on the rebound. He is safe and boring. Niven almost dies when his chute, with him attached, lands in a lake. He is pulled out right before he drowns. He has tried to get Loretta back even to the point of getting into fisticuffs with Crawford, and she runs to his side as he is injured on the dock. She leaves Crawford when Niven realizes that his scrape with death was what he needed to finally make him want to settle down in a picturesque country home with Loretta and give up magic for good. What is great about this movie is valiant attempts at magical special effects for the time in which it was made: hypnotic trances, double vision, aerial photography from the plane, mysterious tricks of the eye (camera). At times cheesey, at times not--always entertaining to the viewer. They also did a good job training the magician's bunnies to fall in love with each other at the end of the movie.",1275523200,3,2258,4.619402985074627
1906081,1,B0000AGWMQ,"""Eternally Yours"" is a weak romantic comedy notable only for the rapport of leads David Niven, as a magician, and Loretta Young, as his neglected wife.  With Walter Wanger producing, Tay Garnett directing and a sterling supporting cast, the film promises much much more than it delivers. It is tedious and predictable.

The print is dreadful. The picture is murky at times, the soundtrack woolly and there are endless splices when the continuity jumps.  Don't waste your money.",1236988800,,477,5.089743589743589
1906082,1,B0000AGWMQ,"This DVD is absolutely the cheapest, sleaziest production I've ever encountered!! It's a badly homemade DVD-R, with a low-grade resolution equivalent to the worst YouTube stuff, and it doesn't even fill up a third of the single-layer disc. Furthermore, the aspect ratio is wrong, so everything looks squashed unless you can correct this on your set. It was probably ripped from a TV broadcast late night cheapie print, with no contrast, wobbly picture, and tinny sound. The packaging has not one word of information about the film, like year, director, or even length. There's not even any identification on the wrap or the disc, apart from a suspicious-looking website and a barcode.  In other words, it's a total rip-off, and I don't understand how amazon could have offered this for sale.
On the positive side: at least it is the film it claims to be, hence the single star.",1231977600,2,877,4.885906040268456

1906084,1,B0000AGWMQ,"This is not the movie I would have liked to watch since the story of the movie is tame and anticlimactic; then again I am a big fan of Loretta Young, who plays beautiful Anita Halstead an engaged woman to be married. She breaks her engagement to marry a magician named Arturo (David Niven) with whom she develops instant love. The happiness does not last long since her role as a wife and stage assistant is a little too much to handle when she finds out that she has to go on a world tour, and watch her husband's dare-devil stunts and his flirtations with other women.  It doesn't take too long for her to divorce him and remarry again, but the magician doesn't give up sitting down. He goes after her, to win her back in spite of the fact she is remarried. Finally Anita realizes that she still loves him, then divorces her second husband and marries Arturo again. The movie is categorized as a comedy, but it is not; it is also fast paced in the sense that Anita marries almost instantly to Arturo after breaking her engagement, and then divorces him before you know what is happening, and then remarries again. This story is set in year 1939, a conservative era for an unorthodox movie. I certainly don't think the studio needed a fine actress like Loretta Young for this role.",1187740800,,1282,4.45531914893617
1906085,3,B0000AGWMQ,"Lighthearted, predictable, but entirely enjoyabe.  Zazu Pitts is the glue that holds a good deal of the premise together. This is a film that epitomizes the productions of it's time.",1127952000,10,182,5.066666666666666

1906096,3,B0000AGWMQ,"A very fluffy, fun romantic comedy which boasts ""The Bishop's Wife"" co-stars David Niven and Loretta Young. Niven is perfect as a devil-may-care magician and Young plays his fawning, clever wife. It's pure 1930s escapism and certainly worth a peek if you like these bygone films with a cast of classic, wonderful actors. Lovable, father-figure actor C. Aubrey Smith plays Young's tolerant Episcopal bishop grandfather (there's that ""bishop's"" theme again).",1409270400,,456,5.5285714285714285

1906101,2,B0000AGWMQ,"Luminescent Loretta Young captivates in this film pairing her and fellow star of The Bishop's Wife David Niven. Instantly attracted, they marry and she joins his illusionist act on tour. His all-encompassing preoccupation with career leave her the one constantly giving, he taking. His promotion of his work leaves him away for hours wining and dining female newspaper reporters which he purposefully desires his wife to think are romantically interested in him. I admit this shallowness makes me dislike him. When she makes a decisive move to deal with this intolerable situation; he pursues her incessantly. I give the movie 2 stars because he really did not seem to change, but probably in its time his behavior was regarded as ardent and romantic and he probably was considered a sympathetic character. It's difficult to discern whether his efforts are because he desires her back, for the thrill of the chase; or to prove he can captivate an audience. Perhaps it is some of all three. Admirably and believably she resists in every point realizing she isn't going to change him. He, vulnerable to this spurning, still pursues. Obviously we are to think his persistence a measure of devotion. The ending presents a circumstance one hopes is evidence of his bending and a return of the giving she so graciously extended time and again.",1403481600,,1337,5.0

1906108,5,B0000AGWMQ,"While some of the events in the movie are a little cheesy or unbelievable (David Niven as a Magician and Loretta Young's other love interest), the storyline and the chemistry between David Niven & Loretta Young makes this movie definitely worth watching.

1906115,4,B0000AGWMQ,"I am a fan of Loretta Young and of the old Glamour days of Hollywood so I am a little biased in saying I really liked this movie. That being said, it was a fun movie to watch with the bantering between the two major characters played by Loretta and David Niven.  Someone gave this movie a negative rating by saying by the end of the movie they didn't care who ended up with whom...I beg to differ! These two characters belonged together and with the twists and turns and humor I was certainly rooting for them. Loretta looks gorgeous of course, (it was made around 1940's) without a hair out of place and gorgeous gowns, but that was the allure of it all, wasn't it? Niven plays a magician/daredevil type and it was interesting to see some of the tricks of that trade included in this love story. A comedy/drama, it kept my attention. Not saying it was a Bette Davis ""Jezebel"" movie (God, did they get any better?) but it was worth adding to my collection. If you are not a fan of old movies you may not agree with my assessment, but if you like these old ones, you will probably like this one. The actual movie was in great shape as far as sound and very clear picture, but I did notice at least one small scene was left out. Nothing major, but I've seen the movie before, so I noticed. True fans do that kind of thing!",1346889600,8,1320,4.238095238095238
