1347607,3,B00004S9AJ,"At 29, I can honestly rave about the tape. I am not in the age range that they targeted this video to, but I bought it. I was attracted by what seemed to be the slower pace and music that I like. Well, I was pleased. Sure it does fluctuate in volume now and again and sometimes Billy is hard to hear, but overall I give it a 3. It's not his best work, but it sure is great and worth the money. I own the original Tae-Bo and find the pace frantic and sometimes jarring. I feel peaceful and like I'm learning the exercises. I work up a good sweat and feel accomplished. I do plan on moving back to the original when I've mastered this, but this tape is a great beginner tape or great for anyone of ANY AGE getting into a workout. You can keep up them...and feel accomplished!",978393600,15,773,4.0588235294117645
1347608,1,B00004S9AJ,"I am new to the world of Tae-Bo and have been working with the ""Basic"" video for approximately three weeks. I have several health problems which preclude me from doing all the moves on this Basic  video 100% (among them neuropathy in both legs which has left me with  little balance) and so was interested in the ""Tae-Bo Gold""  version for ""people over 40."" (I am 51 years old.) I do enjoy the  ""Basic"" video. It is clean, well-taught, well-paced, and I am  getting better at it. When I heard about the ""Tae-Bo Gold"" video,  I believed it would be geared more to my immediate ability and the  ""come-on"" that the music was the ""oldies"" I remembered  gave it added attraction. When I received the video I popped it into the  VCR and got ready to ""rock."" With the first warm-up I felt as  though instead of ""rockin'"" I had had a rock dropped on me. I was  EXTREMELY disappointed in the ""Tae-Bo Gold"" video. It is  disjointed, the sound is inconsistent, it is difficult to hear Mr. Blank  give directions, the setup for the exercises is too quick giving little  time to get into the exercise, the number of repititions is too few, giving  no feeling of ""working out."" I am returning this video and will  stick to the ""Basic"" video and work into getting that video down  pat. I can only think that Tae-Bo succumbed to marketing pressure and put  out a video that was meant to be a ""candy bar"" for the elderly.  Mr. Blank, I am disappointed.",957657600,63,1435,4.42911877394636
1347609,5,B00004S9AJ,"I purchased this video when it first came out.  I found the regular tae bo videos to be a little intense for my 59 year old body!  However, the gold version is designed for the older folks and I've been using it for many years.  I only wish it were available on DVD instead of VHS.  I've bought it for many of my friends and purchased another copy for myself upon giving away my original.  Very good for the abs, and to strengthen your flexibility.  I did get a little tired of the music, so made a CD from my Credence Clearwater Best Of to match the moves and play it right along with my exercise video.  It's not perfect but close enough for a musical change. It takes very little space to do the exercises, and options for those starting out that can't quite reach or stretch or kick yet.  Great for the beginner.  Still enough to increase the heart rate.  It's still my favorite.",1202860800,,883,4.265060240963855
1347610,1,B00004S9AJ,"Have bought 3 VHS tapes and they have gone bad after 2 months of use. I have tried them on 3 different VCRs. Can I get another tape at no charge or is it possible to get this on DVD?

Thank you",1182038400,,193,3.5952380952380953
1347611,5,B00004S9AJ,"I love this tape, and only wish he had more variety for the over 40 crowd.  I'm wearing this thing out.",1173052800,,103,3.9047619047619047
1347612,5,B00004S9AJ,"I have many of Billys videos and a lot of them are a little to much for me, I am 66 years old. I love doing Tae Bo Gold before I do my strenth training on my bow flex, it limbers me up and get my blood flowing. Great way to start the day. As others have said Billy isn't too accurate on his counting so I reverse the exercises every other time to keep me balanced. My only regret is that I can't get it on dvd so I can do it on my portable dvd player while traveling. I have been doing Gold for at least two years and it helps me keep my weight down, I weigh 158 lbs and am 67"" tall. I don't want to become a GOOM (grossly overweight old man).",1134864000,2,643,3.7007299270072993
1347613,5,B00004S9AJ,"After having my first child and being on continuous bedrest during my pregnancy I had went from 130lbs to 180lbs by the time I had delivered and my 6 weeks of recovering were over. To get myself back in shape, I purchased this workout. Mostly though, because all that ""bing, bong, beep beep, bang"" music they play in the background drives me nuts in the other Tae-Bo workouts and the music in this workout is more tolerable.
Anywho, that's not really the point of the Gold workout or this review.  After doing this workout 3-4 days a week, walking (not too far) on the days I wasn't attacking Tae-Bo and also eating one of those balanced food pyramid type of diets that aren't so popular anymore, I got back down to 140lbs in 4 months. WOO HOO! The last 10lbs came off within a few months after I had stopped working at a restaurant with grease food.
Now after having my second child I'm just starting to get back into this Tae-Bo stuff because I tried losing the weight other ways and they make me feel like crap and the weight just isn't coming off very fast. It's been 9 months since birth and I've lost 15lbs since birth via being a housewife.
If you're starting out I'd do this tape. I eventually worked up to the more advanced workouts but I didn't lose anymore and I just started looking more muscular like a man, I didn't like that too much so I stuck to the Gold and I'm doing it again. Being a muscularly person just isn't my cup of tea , if it's not yours either but you'd like to keep the weight off, you ought to try this.",1089072000,8,1535,4.274914089347079
1347614,5,B00004S9AJ,"ME AND CO-WORKERS LOVE THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO EVEN THOUGH SOME OF US ARE UNDER 40 WE STILL GET A GOOD WORKOUT.  WE RECENTLY STARTED WORKING OUT AND THIS GOES AT A PRETTY GOOD PACE WITHOUT BEING TOO MUCH OR BEING TOO LITTLE.  THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE, AND THIS IS NOT REALLY A COMPLAINT, IS THAT HE DOES MORE REPS ON ONE SIDE THEN HE DOES ON THE OTHER SIDE.",1087948800,4,356,4.071428571428571
1347615,4,B00004S9AJ,"Although I'm only 36, I decided to try this workout as my first Tae Bo video because I'm still fairly new to kickboxing.  Taught by Tae Bo instructor Billy Blanks, this workout is extremely low-impact yet also surprisingly tough at the same time.  Billy leads a class of mostly middle-aged participants, but they are all in very good shape, including the 70-year old woman who can kick MUCH higher than I can!
After a few minutes of warm-up stretches, Billy begins an easy to follow kickboxing routine.  He emphasizes punches more than kicks, although some kicks as well as quite a few knee lifts are included.  Unlike other kickboxing workouts I have tried, there are few combination routines; instead, Billy teaches in an 8-count style, often repeating the same movement for several sets.  Following the 25-minute aerobic segment, you hold a static squat for 1 minute, and then you move to a hands and knees position for about 3 minutes of work on the butt area.  The workout ends with a 5 minutes stretch:  4-minutes of yoga-like stretches in a seated position and then a final 1-minute of standing stretches, making the total workout time about 34 minutes.
As an instructor, Billy Blanks is very likeable and extremely enthusiastic.  Plus, he offers many modifications in this workout, even showing how some of the kicks can be done seated in a chair.  However, his counting is not always accurate, and he frequently completes an uneven number of sets from one side of the body to the other.  Also, the Motown music used for this workout is quite loud, making Billy's instructions a bit difficult to hear at times, and the transitions from song-to-song did not flow smoothly with the workout.  If you can overlook these minor flaws, this is a fun workout for anyone who is already in fairly good shape but looking to give Tae Bo a try.",1084060800,12,1839,4.751572327044025
1347616,4,B00004S9AJ,"I love this video! I've been working with it for only three days, but I can FEEL it already!! It is a good workout for people who don't do ""bouncy"" aerobics. It's not long, it is about 35 min from start to finish. I like that he is not as FRANTIC in this one. I feel rushed on his other videos, while this one is quick-paced, it is not rushed. The sound quality is not great, but that's fine, he's still easily understood.
I also love the GLUTES and ABS Video, it was my first Tae-Bo experience, and I alternate. It's a little more frantic-paced than this one, but it's good too if you move at your own speed.
By the way, I am not yet forty, but that doesn't matter any more.
Happy Work-OUT!!",1075507200,5,692,4.133333333333334
1347617,4,B00004S9AJ,"I'd been doing Tae Bo since Billy Banks released his first workout tapes.  Followng back surgery last year my surgeon warned me off of high impact aerobics and specifically told me my Tae Bo days were over.  Not happy with this, I e-mailed Billy Banks gym and a member of his staff recommended this tape.  I'm so glad they did!  There is nothing in this workout that I can't do - but don't let that fool you into thinking that this is a whimpy workout - I break a sweat every time.  One year later my back surgeon has pronounced me one of his best rehab patients.  I'd recommend this for anyone who needs to workout but maybe has to tone it down a notch from some of the more punishing thngs we do to ourselves in the name of fitness.",1044748800,3,734,4.170212765957447
1347618,5,B00004S9AJ,"This is a great video for anyone wh wants to do kick boxing, but can't keep up with the pace.  I am 35 years old and this is perfect for me.  It keeps you motavated when you see the seniors on this video do the kicking.  It makes you say ""Hey if this old lady can do it so can I"".  Great video for any age.",1035417600,2,306,3.590909090909091
1347619,5,B00004S9AJ,"I purchased this tape though I'm under 40, as my 1st Tae-Bo tape. I'm a fairly out-of shape person with plenty of weight to lose. After 6 weeks I'm ready to tackle a more advanced Tae-Bo tape...I'm hooked.
This tape works. I've lost an inch off my waist and am even getting definition. I work up a major sweat doing this workout. With other tapes I've never gotten results this quickly. It's fun to do and the 35 minutes go by fast. The sound quality is definitely a little off, but keep the volume up for the music & Billy's comments. He's very motivating.
I would just recommend interspersing this every other day with a more standard aerobic tape if you have any neck or back problems, the punching gets a little intense. Of course if you keep doing it you'll get stronger!
I really can't say enough good things about this tape. Believe me, do this workout regularly, watch your fat AND CARBS! And you will look, and most importantly feel, better.",1016668800,6,950,4.497109826589595
1347620,4,B00004S9AJ,"Anybody that has seen the tapes, talk shows or seen him in person has to admit that Billy Blanks is one of the good guys.  That not withstanding while you can appreciate his intentions you can't always appreciate how hard his exercise tapes can be.  I think there is very little, other than the floor work and time, that differentiates the advanced and basic tapes in his very first series of exercise tapes.  But this tape is different.  While the moves are still challenging there are fewer stranger combinations and the music is at a slower pace.  I have to agree with another reviewer that I would recommend people start with this tape and then move on to a basic tape.  I also had excellent sound and picture quality so I don't have any complaints there.
My only complaint is an old one that many have voiced.  He doesn't always do the same number of repetitions on each side.  I rotate his tape in my exercise routine and have to remember to alternate my lead legs so I don't feel unbalanced.  You would think by now that he would have someone, like his daughter (who is excellent by the way) or someone off camera ensuring he does a balanced workout.",1003968000,6,1157,4.4714285714285715
1347621,5,B00004S9AJ,"Though initially having qualms about trying this one after attempting with some difficulty the moves on the original Tae Bo tapes (owned by a dance-trained teen in my family), I found this definitely smoother and more do-able. This is NOT just for the ""over-40"" bunch but also for anyone from beginning to intermediate level who likes variety and/or wants to get an effective workout without feeling intimidated by the longer and/or more difficult tapes. This tape gives you approximately a 35-minute workout including warmup and cool down, and I found the time to go by quickly!

 I do recommend getting (or borrowing) the INSTRUCTIONAL video that is sold separately or comes with either the original or LIVE 4-tape series, especially if you are not familiar with TAE BO and have not mastered the moves.

  Also, unless you are naturally coordinated and catch on to moves quickly, I feel GOLD is a better tape for the beginner to start with than BASIC. Once GOLD is ma! stered, the 8 MINUTE tape for practice (or when time-limited) and the BASIC are both fine to ""add"" or grow into as you expand your WILL and make TAE BO at least ONE WAY to accomplish your fitness goals!

  The most prevalent complaint I have heard about this tape that SOME experience is a lack of SOUND QUALITY.  My tape is SUPERB in both PICTURE and SOUND QUALITY. I have no problem at all hearing Billy and his instructions. I also happen to LOVE the HIGH ENERGY ""Billy Blanks theme"" music some folks find ""not so wonderful. It gets me moving, and that's what counts for me! I also LOVE the addition of 50's and 60's upbeat SOUL MUSIC that appears on this video for an added touch.

 (I have found, however, on other Tae Bo videos I've experienced, that there is sometimes wide variations of sound and/or picture quality, even in different copies of the SAME video. For example, I found two BASIC videos in the Live Series, where one ""skipped"" over sound and picture but was! loud and clear otherwise, and another with perfect picture but very subdued sound. However, I also found the TAE BO headquarters had good listeners who may replace a tape that had defect in copying quality or workmanship with a new tape. Their website has a place to email them as well as post comments.)

 Since I believe Tae Bo and BILLY stand by their product, and since this tape I own displayed no defects, I believe it merits five stars. The red-carpeted exercise floor and enthusiastic bunch of participants in the WELL-ATTENDED CLASS, with memebers appearing to range from less than middle-aged to about early 80's. each at various stages of fitness developemnt, creates an unboring atmosphere that gives the home participant the feeling of ""being right there.""

  Billy gets right up in your face at times, admonishing you to not give up. He is a very motivating and inspirational instructor who encourages you to do what you can and gives you space to NOT DO what! you can't. He encourages you to compete only with yourself, feel GOOD about yourself for doing what you did and not feel discouraged about what you can't YET do. He comes from an spiritual space as well as a physical one, and this can be felt and sensed. This tape does work me into a sweat and lets me feel the effects afterwards--feeling more energized and with tighter abs, arms, legs and glutes. The combination of this class with Billy's instructions, sincerity, and enthusiasm makes for an interesting and effective workout video.",994204800,29,3461,4.724252491694352
1347622,4,B00004S9AJ,"I am new to tae-bo.  I have been using the tapes for about 5 weeks.  I purchased tae-bo gold for variety.  I am 32 years old and totally love this video. This video states that it is for people over 40.  It's very challenging and slightly more mellow than some of his other tapes.  But, don't let the title fool you. There are some ""over 40"" people in this video that make me proud to be growing older. There is an older female in this video that is right in the front and kicks her legs higher than billy does! To see this woman work out, it is truely amazing and inspiring.  I highly recommend it.  I know it's hard to hear billy at times but, he has an assistant that helps you count so that you don't loose track.  I feel good when I'm finished with this video.",985996800,5,765,4.087248322147651
1347623,5,B00004S9AJ,"I recently purchased Tae Bo Gold and I can't say enough about it.  I am 45 years old and practice martial arts, but found that was not enough and I wanted something to help boost my endurance.  I have viewed other Tae Bo workouts and they were good, but were a little too fast paced for me.  As I browsed the fitness tapes and lo and behold I happened across this particular one.  The first time I used it, I was hooked!!!  It not only gave me a good workout,[it was a little slower paced (but not too slow)], I could keep up with it the whole way through.  I not only felt rejuvenated, I felt good about myself.  I can't wait to do the workout again today.  I like this because I really don't care for aerobic exercise.  I highly recommend this workout tape for anyone.  Billy keeps you motivated and keeps saying take it at your own pace....I like that.

1347625,3,B00004S9AJ,"I am an over-40 Tae-Bo veteran who found myself bored with the Basic tape and not willing to spend the time needed for the Advanced tape.  So I was stuck in the middle until I purchased the Gold tape about 8 months ago.  Although Billy is hard to hear at times, the tape is not as jarring as the Advanced and the music is much better than the Basic. I enjoy seeing regular people like myself in the video and the Motown music is a real motivator for me.  Others have knocked this tape as a ""sell out"" for Blanks, saying he caved in to popular demands, but isn't that what exercise is all about?
