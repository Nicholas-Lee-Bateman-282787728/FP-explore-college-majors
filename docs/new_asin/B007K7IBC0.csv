8518931,5,B007K7IBC0,"Harry Truman was President before my birth so it wasn't until later in life I became aware of him.  After reading books and watching this DVD I realize how badly our country lacks the leadership that Harry Truman offered. And how desperately we need his style of leadership again.  Straight-talking, truth-telling, owns what he says and lives with his decisions...that was Harry Truman.

I have often been told I am like Harry Truman.  Now, I proudly admit, I am.  I understand why people either like us or hate us.  Some people like straight answers and others like a lot of candy-coating so the truth is distorted and they don't have to deal with it.  Personally, I prefer Harry Truman's style!

For younger generations seeking leadership positions this DVD will be helpful and educational on how a true leader should conduct him/herself.  If a more experienced adult sees this DVD they will no doubt miss the days of when a true leader led this great nation!  Yes, indeed David Susskind brought us this interview in his post Presidential years, but in spite of all the changes we have lived through President Harry Truman always stayed the same!",1365638400,5,1148,4.811224489795919
8518932,5,B007K7IBC0,"Those who remember the Golden Age of the TV talk show, fondly remember producer David Susskind, who for nearly 30 years interviewed celebrities - whether entertainment or political - on his weekly show. It began on local New York City television in 1958 on the independent TV station WNTA. (The same station that aired his ""Play of the Week Series"") When WNTA became a public broadcasting station, the show - ""Open End"" went into syndication. It also changed its name sometimes to ""The David Susskind Show""

Unlike the Dick Cavett Show - which I have devoured on DVD - Susskind was more serious in interviewing a guest during his one- hour or two-hour show (less commercials). I'd compare him more with Charlie Rose - but with a decidedly New York accent. And he could be sarcastic.

To my knowledge none of the ""Open End"" shows has been available on home video until last year when S'more Entertainment began releasing them (a two-hour Jerry Lewis interview was the first).

This DVD consists of 1  Susskind programs. The first, and most important, one is from the earlier ""Open End"" period. It's a two-hour interview from 1961 with the 33rd US President, Harry S. Truman. It was rebroadcast 23 years later as part of ""The David Susskind Show"" and that is the source of this print. Truman was then 77 years old and still as feisty as he was in office when he left in 1952. At the time of the interview he was still ""going to work"" at his Presidential Library every day. He spends a lot of time talking about college students, who he calls ""those youngsters"", emphasizes the importance of teachers and the fact that they are underpaid and not appreciated. He talks about John Kennedy, who was in office then and offers an interesting answer when Susskind asks him to name his three greatest Presidents. I'll not reveal the answer so not to be a ""spoiler"". The nearly 2 hours goes by quickly.

The DVD - despite the time listed on the package as 55 minutes, and on the Amazon listing as 112 minutes - really 165 minutes long (that 2  hours!). You've already heard about the first hour and 45 minutes. The last hour or so is from a 1974  ""David Susskind Show"" titled ""The Truman Nobody Knew"". It features Truman biographer Merle Miller, who had just written the best seller ""Plain Speaking"" based on recorded interviews with Truman and producer Robert Alan Aurthur who co=produced (with Susskind) the recorded interviews with Truman. They play some of the uncensored audiotapes as part of this program. This section is the first hour of a two-hour ""Susskind"" show. The second hour - unrelated to Truman - is not included.

The Truman interview is in Black and white and the image is reasonably sharp. The color print for the second show is acceptable but grainy, though that really doesn't affect watching it.
I know that anyone interested in history will find these shows fascinating and than the folks at S'more for making it available for the first time on home video. It's also something that belongs in every public library. There are DVD versions of James Whitmore starring in the 1975 film of the play with the same name as this DVD. But here you get the real thing.

I hope that S'more Entertainment will continue to release these Susskind shows, many of which (like this one from New York's WNEW-TV) were only shown in New York area.

And, I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
