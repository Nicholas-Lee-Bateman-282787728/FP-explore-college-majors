8275979,3,B001A40ZF0,"This DVD of Oleg Emelyanov is inspiring, the workouts are very hard core and full of evergy. Oleg is very big and can probably be in the top 5 of the Mr. Olympia
for 2011 if he is hungry and can  put in the kind of intense training to beat the Americans. Good luck  to him.

8275980,3,B001A40ZF0,"Most bodybuilder DVD's show bodybuilders doing realistic workouts.  This was meant to have a plot and is very scripted.  Fighting scenes have special, fake knockout sounds.  They show a tiger walking in the snow and it's clearly stock footage, not something that happened by surprise.
Oleg is not one ounce as bronze as he appears on the DVD cover.  He is pale as you would expect him to be.  I loved seeing the sorta-buff Putin shirtless.  Oleg is about his complexion.  Unlike other films where the main character is always victorious, this shows Oleg taking some blows.  If you like just looking at Zeb Atlas' body, then you will love Oleg's too.  This is one step away from softcore.
At one point, a man lashes Oleg with what look to my African-American eyes like a stalk of collared greens.  There are many snow scenes.  I think it means to show the Russians' toughness against cold weather, but it may also be a contrast to a warm Venice Beach or Las Vegas.  Luckily, there is male nudity here, but unfortunately, it's not from Oleg.  The nudity almost reminds me of the kind shown in Season One of ""Project Runway.""
Did you love the beginning of ""Red Heat"" where you saw beautiful, buff Russian bodies?  Ahnuld's body was nice, but along with other muscular bodies, it's even more pleasurable.  Well, this shows Oleg with other shirtless Russians and if you are into that, you'll be into this work, which is otherwise silly.  Enjoy the eye candy and put your critical thinking skills to the side for this ride.",1261353600,,1517,4.646616541353383
