1880850,3,B000096IBN,"The first installment benefits from its outstanding voiceover work from Susan Sullivan (""Hippolyta""), Robert Englund (""Felix Faust""), and John Rhys-Davies (""Hades), along with series regulars Susan Eisenberg (""Wonder Woman"") and Michael Rosenbaum (""The Flash"").  It also has a slam-bang finish featuring a battle between JLA and skeleton warriors called up by Hades.  The fight is similar to Harryhausen's magnificently staged finale to ""Jason and the Argonauts"".
Unfortunately, this episode is paired with the worst episode of JLA's first season: ""War World"".  There is very little noteworthy about this poorly written installment.
One might call it ""Superman in Thunderdome"".
There's just very little ""lightning"" around.",1057622400,8,722,5.923076923076923
1880851,2,B000096IBN,"Ok, So I have bought these Justice League DVDs so far because well they are high quality have a few special features thrown in and have been in release date order so I can imagine them being a seasonal set. HOWEVER Now, for no real reason the WB has decided to ignore that and release to Episodes out of order! This Disc should contain 'Injustice for All' & 'Paradise Lost' However it contains 'War World' instead of 'Injustice for All' Messing up the order of the series. I really don't understand what the WB is doing, they won't release seasonal sets, they won't release the Wide-Screen Version of Justice League, they barely put features on the discs and they put their discs in some of the ugliest Kiddy Boxes I have ever seen! How about releasing the widescreen version in a season set, because adults have money for season sets and like widescreen and the kids can keep their out of order standard versions. I mean I know WB just wants to sell and make money but come on at least try to put out quality product.",1053561600,11,1018,4.449197860962567
1880852,2,B000096IBN,"The one piece of good news about this release is that WB is appearantly speeding up the production of its single disc releases, from 2/year to at least 3, and maybe even 4. The thing is, who really feels good about buying 3 seperate discs when most companies are releasing full seasons for a little over the cost of one and a half?
To add to that, the two story arcs on this disc again, highlight many strengths of the series that are unfortunately cancelled out by some blatant flaws. The first arc, Paradise Lost, focuses on the rather underused Wonder Woman as she returns home, only to find her mother and sisters frozen in stone. Wonder Woman then enlists the help of the rest of the League to combat the sorcerer Felix Faust and Lord Hades, who has been freed from Tartarus. Despite a stunning finale that truly represents the epic scope of the series (and voice work from the actors that've played Freddy Krueger and LotR's Gimli) and the emotional pathos it can accomplish, the first half suffers from a rather drawn out fight between Superman and Wonder Woman that seems to be a time filler. There are some plot holes, like why the best plan the League can think of is to give Faust the key to Hades' realm, then immediately try to get it back from him. And finally, Superman gets slapped down like a red-headed stepchild.
The other story arc, War World, is probably the worst arc of the season. Hyped as an episode meant to showcase Superman, the real star here is the slave warrior Draaga, who slips in out of nowhere to steal the spotlight off Superman. While this actually makes sense plotwise, it disappoints because Superman puts up a rather poor showing. Did he forget about super speed? Is his flight limited to hovering a few meters off the ground? Is he only allowed to use heat vision once before it has to recharge? The arc does, however, explore the interaction between Green Lantern and Hawkgirl, and also gives J'onn some rather funny moments.
By now everyone knows the ""care"" WB puts into these releases. Strong audio/video presentations aside (and that's only because JL is a recent show), expect limited extras and quickie featurettes. I'll give Timm credit though, he dishes out a lot of good information, and makes use of the limited time. If you bought the two previous DVDs, there's no reason not to buy this one, really. WB has confirmed that it won't do season sets, and the episodes here, overall, are about the same quality as the previous releases (even counting the disappointing War World). A JL set would be worth five stars. This single disc release is only worth two.",1052784000,6,2608,4.634989200863931
1880853,5,B000096IBN,"In this DVD release you will find two seperate two-part episodes of the Cartoon Network animated series Justice League. As a quick heads-up for those not in the know, Justice League is the updated version of the Superfriends of years gone by. DC Comics superheroes like Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Flash, Hawkgirl and others band together to help stop evil where ever it may be.
In the first episode ""Paradise Lost"" our own favorite Amazon, Wonder Woman, takes center stage. The dark sorcerer Felix Faust (voiced by Nightmare on Elm Street star Robert Englund) is in search of several mystic items to free his imprisoned mentor. One such mystic artifact is located on Wonder Woman's home of Themyscira. (Paradise Island) When Diana visits her homeland she discovers that all her Amazon sisters have been turned to stone and finds Felix Faust lying in wait. She discovers that the only way she can turn her people back to normal is by helping Faust gain the remaining artifacts scattered all across the globe. With the Justice League's help Diana finds the items and is shocked to discover exactly who Felix Faust's mentor really is. This has to be my absolute favorite episode of all the season one releases. Not only do we get to see more of Wonder Woman's background, but fans of the characters get to see something that rarely is ever shown: a knock-down drag-out fight between Superman and Wonder Woman. This episode alone is worth the price of purchase.
The second episode is the Superman centered ""War World"". Superman (voiced by actor George Newbern) is taken prisoner to a savage world where warriors are forced to battle in a gladiator-like spectical for the world's dictator Mongul (voiced by actor Eric Roberts). While there Superman battle's the hulking yet honorable warrior Draaga and makes a name for himself among the planet's people. While trapped there, fellow Justice Leaguers Green Lantern, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter try to save their captured comrade and stop Mongul from continuing his barbaric sport. One complaint fans of the series have had is that Superman tends to be the team's rag-doll, often taking the brunt of the attacks due to his strength and invulnerability. This is very much shown in this episode. That aside, this episode does highlight lots of character development. If your a fan of the comic characters, or simply a fan of good stories, I strongly suggest you purchase this fantastic DVD.",1051747200,8,2439,4.965770171149145
1880854,5,B000096IBN,"I cannot rate this film because I recently purchased it on Thursday, February 4th at Walgreens for $3.99.  But I will give it  5 stars for the price.  I also purchased Superman-Doomsday for the same price.  I have watched the WONDER WOMAN animated series, and loved it!  So if you are on a budget, check out Walgreens Pharmacy, Ross Stores, Albertson's, and Ralphs Supermakets for movies.  You can get very GOOD deals!",1265500800,,418,4.736111111111111
1880855,5,B000096IBN,This was a birthday gift for my grandson. He gives it a 5 star rating.,1210464000,,70,3.7333333333333334
1880856,1,B000096IBN,"This is one of the worse cases of price-gouging I've seen in quite a while.

Personally, I LOVE the JLU tv show and I wouldn't think twice to pick up a box set (if they'd just release one). However, to make fans of the show buy it (basically) episode-by-episode, is really ridiculous.

I'm sure there'll be a box set at some point, you'd do better to save your money until then. If you need a fix in the meantime, these discs would make better rentals.",1135987200,,452,4.305882352941176
1880857,1,B000096IBN,"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner.",1110412800,4,724,4.534351145038168
1880858,5,B000096IBN,"As most of the people here i must say i hate WB so much! We, Justice League Fans, want SEASON BOX SETS!!! we don't want single episodes to be release, we want them all...Paradise Lost DVD contains episodes ""Paradise Lost"" and ""Enemy below"" which are great episodes from season 1 of the show...Please WB, release the SEASON BOX SETS NOW!",1094169600,5,336,4.616666666666666
1880859,1,B000096IBN,Warner Bros. has consistantly failed to please fans with their dvd releases of their animated series. They fail to recognize that Justice League as well as their Batman and Superman animated efforts were created not just for children but for adults as well. Yet they continue to market them for the kiddie market. It just demonstrates the short sightedness of their home ent. people. Come on now !!! The new Spiderman animated series on MTV is already being released as a season box set. Don't be stupid WB !!!!!!!!!!,1073001600,21,517,4.820224719101123
1880860,2,B000096IBN,"$15 just doesn't cut it for 2 episodes of this show and ZERO extra features.  I'm not sure who they are marketing this set for, but I can think of no reason why anyone would buy this. It offers nothing that you can't see in repeats on Cartoon Network.",1070755200,11,251,4.122448979591836
1880861,5,B000096IBN,I have watched Paradise Lost and War World and both episodes are great!  I have collected all the 3 Justice League DVDs so far...,1066089600,,129,4.375
1880862,3,B000096IBN,"Two two-parters inhabit this disc, both (disappointingly) in Pan & Scan (aka full screen). The title two parter, ""Paradise Lost"" is strong, with a good story, animation and voice acting. The second (and weaker) two parter, ""War World"", is much as it was in the comics - a setting to make known characters get to lay the smack down. The presentations of the story are enhanced by the excellent Bruce Timm introductions - but a word of warning; if you haven't seen these episodes, watch his comments AFTERwards. Bruce always tends to give a bit of the story away. Another aggravating item - Chapter Stops are basically absent; for example, one must sit through (or fast forward) the full intro when watching each episode on the disc. A good stopgap until we someday get Season Boxed sets - in widescreen, please.",1061683200,3,810,4.75177304964539
