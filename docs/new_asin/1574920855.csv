195892,5,1574920855,"... so it's still very fresh in my mind.  One reviewer is wrong - there is  footage of burn victims receiving care.  There are interviews with  survivors giving their eye witness accounts.  And yet, there are actors  portraying all the major characters.  There is drama and documentary here  and I was spellbound with it.
The elderly neighbor woman who lost her  only son in a test plane in Texas in 1941 and blamed the Japanese for her  loss did not affect me the way this movie did.  My father's experiences in  the Philipines was a story I'd heard all my life.  I don't think my father  knew the course of events depicted in this movie.
It's black and white,  so the documentary footage isn't as disruptive as it might have been, but  it's high effective, I think.  I'm buying the DVD now so I can watch it  again... then maybe when my sons are old enough, I can show them why the  usually peace-loving US was the only country to ever use nuclear bombs  against another nation... and why we don't use them anymore.
I never  really admired Truman until now, but I'm still compelled to ask how he ever  slept at night.",965606400,13,1119,4.4088669950738915
195893,2,1574920855,"I was intrigued enough about the historical facts surrounding Hiroshima  that this title appealed to me. It is actually two POVs sewn into one movie  - an American version and a Japanese version shot by a Japanese director.  That makes it interesting enough in parts...but this movie is far too dull  for long stretches. In the end, watch it on cable - that's what it was made  for anyways!",953942400,2,390,4.594202898550725
195894,5,1574920855,"Few decisions have been debated as long, fiercely or futilely as the decision to drop the Atomic Bomb on Japan at the end of the Second World War. Few situations involved as many diverse factors and none had the  far-reaching ramifications of this one.
Hiroshima is a straight-forward,  documentary-styled portrayal of the many problems facing the political and  military leaders of the major powers in 1945.  The choice made by President  Truman was based on the advice of an extremely diverse group of advisors,  both military and civilian, most of whom knew the war was nearing its end  and many of whom had personal agendas which influenced their input.  Additionally, the involvement of allied heads of state, particularly Prime  Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin, played a  significant role and are carefully addressed in the film.
What I found  most impressive was the objective and somewhat sympathetic treatment of the  Japanese political leadership, who faced nearly insurmountable odds in  dealing with an intractible military hierarchy which was unwilling to  acknowledge defeat, complicated by the delicate need to negotiate a rapid  settlement so as to avoid further civilian casualties, avoid further loss  of national honor, and maintain the deified status of the emperor.
The  failure to understand culturally dictated diplomatic subtleties is quietly  yet forcefully examined, alongwith sometimes intentional disregard of more  obvious overtures.
Hiroshima interweaves historical fact with a number of  political assumptions that have come to be accepted as fact.  While many of  the film's apparent conclusions are conceivable and even probable, the  viewer is cautioned to remember that this is a drama, not a documentary.  Many of the character depictions are superbly accurate, while others are  composites of several historical figures and yet others only loosely based  on reality.
Another impressive feature of this film is its sensitive  portrayal of the actual employment of the ""Special Bombs.""  There  are the expected views of boiling mushroom clouds.  As the story continues  to unfold, still photos of the devastation are displayed.  However, the  producers successfully resisted the temptation to use footage of the human  damage, and the often utilized scenes of grotesquely burned victims  receiving medical treatment are tactfully absent.
While Hiroshima may not  be entirely reliable in a historical context, the personal and emotional  processes that went into the decision making process are intelligently and  accurately dealt with.  If the viewer takes only one lesson from watching  the film, it should be that all of those involved, from the scientists to  the citizens of the ill-fated target cities, were not simply historical  figures or statistics, but living human beings.  Perhaps the most laudible  accomplishment of this superb film is bringing a human perspective to the  most inhumane (however necessary) event in the history of mankind.
For  anyone who would like to better understand the who's, what's, where's and  especially the why's of the destruction of Hiroshima, this movie is a must  see.",946339200,28,3176,5.4515463917525775

I know that today, there is still much debate over the use of these weapons against a nation, that was obviously defeated, but those who I have discussed this subject with, are unfortunately applying what I call ""Presentism"", which is the fallacy of judging an event of the past or of history, through the eyes of our understanding of a culture or historical event based on our ""current"" set of values. The nature or culture of Japan in 1945 was vastly different and counter to the culture or society of Japan and the Japanese people today. Of all the choices offered to President Truman in 1945, using the bombs was probably the ""least"" worst of all his available choices.",1488153600,5,926,4.618181818181818

195907,4,1574920855,"First of all, the title has nothing to do with the famous John Hershey novel of the same name. What we have here is a Canadian-Japanese co-production concerning the historical events leading up to the decision to use Nuclear weapons on Japan in World War 2. No docu-drama has ever topped 1974's ""Missiles of October"" but this COMES CLOSE in it's presentation and style. The actor playing Harry Truman gives a great performance. We see background meetings, insider infomation sessions and ""perimeter"" events that all lead to the eventual use of the Atomic bomb. Interestingly, we are shown politicians, scientists, military men, citizens and the everyday soldier, bomber pilot, etc. all working in their various capacities that eventually would be tied together in dropping the bomb on Hiroshima. Also we see for the first time, the Japanese execs and military leaders meeting and conflicting with each other over their intentions to fight a defensive battle on Japanese soil. They will disturb you so much with their attitudes and unwillingness to compromise or see reality that you will UNDERSTAND WHY the bombs HAD TO BE DROPPED. Even after Hiroshima, you will know WHY we HAD to drop the second one on Nagasaki. This is something overlooked by modern productions and this film hits the bulls eye about the Japanese military and their refusal to end the conflict. A very good work. Somewhat long, not as gripping or as intense as ""Missiles of October"" but a decent production.",1113782400,11,1478,5.012195121951219

195909,1,1574920855,"Here are the facts, none of which appear in this movie:
1. The US dropped the atomic bombs on Japan so that Japan would surrender to the US before the USSR declared war on Japan (The USSR was then an ally of the Allied Powers)  This gave the US a superior diplomatic position over the USSR.
2. The US dropped the bomb in order to test the effectivness of a nuclear weapon on a populated area.
Both of these points are verifiable with White House / Pentagon memos, and can also be found at the Atomic Bomb Museum in Hiroshima, or the Atomic Bomb Museum's website....it is also worth noting why the US chose Hiroshima as a primary target:
1. Hiroshima was chosen because the city had not been bombed by conventional allied bombers.  For this reason, it would be easier to tell how effective the atomic bomb was against a populated area.
2. Hiroshima was a manufacturing city, with a military base.  Therfore, destroying Hiroshima would slow Japanese production and industry.
It should also be noted that the US dropped thousands of (conventional) bombs on Japan AFTER Japan surrendered (a war crime, under Nuremberg laws).
Here is testimony taken from a suvivor of the Hiroshima bombing:
""She came toward me, carrying a baby on her back and pulling a three-year-old and five-year-old by the hand.  Her face was black and swollen large.  It was afternoon, and she and the children were hungry.  I gave them my lunch.  She said they were thirsty.  I went to get some water and when I got back, the three and five-year-olds had died while eating my lunch.  The mother had died while breast-feeding the baby, who was still alive and suckling.  The sight of them reduced me to tears.  I made a little shelter out of .......Then I thought about my mother.  I was confident she was safe at home, and thought about asking her to make......
Then when I got home, she was not there.  A woman with a black face was lying in the air-raid shelter.  Who are you?  I asked. ""
If you want a more accurate picture of the atomic bombings in Japan, I suggest you look elsewhere....please excuse my lack of proofreading, I don't have much time to write this.  The above testimony is a direct quote from the Atomic Bomb Regristry in Hiroshima",1078963200,15,2219,4.565656565656566
195910,5,1574920855,"This movie gives a sense of the common humanity of both sides, in at least two ways.
First, the movie draws parallels between the make-up of both governments near the end of the war, beginning with U.S. President Truman and Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki.  The two men took office within 5 days of each other, and had their first cabinet meetings at nearly the same time.  Both meetings are in the film.  You can see each man adjusting to the reins of power as he meets with the military leaders of his country.  At his meeting, Suzuki chooses in a calculated way to present himself as a fierce warrior ready to die in battle, while Truman makes no such speech, yet you get the sense that the President, too, perhaps because of his lack of experience, is aware that he needs to communicate himself as a strong leader in order to earn the respect of the officers and civilians in his cabinet.  Truman had the military men under his unquestioned command, though, which cannot be said for Suzuki; and Truman was the highest authority in the U.S., while in Japan that title lay, technically at least, with Emperor Hirohito.  Yet very quietly, the movie draws Suzuki and Truman together as two men in a common situation, determined in their own ways to see an end to the war.  The parallel is not trumpeted in an obvious manner; I did not see it myself until revisiting the movie after several years; but this is a subtle and complex film with many such finely drawn portraits.
Beyond Truman and Suzuki, we get a good sense of the general disagreements within both governments, usually but not always between the military and civilian men.  In Japan, of course, the tension between the two groups became an outright struggle, unlike the more nuanced situation in the U.S., where a civilian, Secretary of State Byrnes, comes off as a hard-liner, and where scientists contribute to the civilian roles (prominently, but not completely, in opposition to the hard-liners).  At one point Colonel Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project, confronts Secretary of War Stimson with the same kind of martial anger that the military leaders of Japan display so memorably throughout the film.  The latter speeches feel authentic, to this particular American, who knows nothing personally of Japan; the dialogue and general portrayal of Colonel Groves can feel ham-fisted and over the top.  I can't say whether the portrayals of Byrnes and Groves are historically accurate, but whatever the case, the abundance of tension makes for very interesting drama to say the least; and the drama draws out one of the most tragic facts of the Hiroshima story: the presence in both these countries, near the end of World War II, of war-weariness.
Secretary Stimson's general disposition ""not to outdo Herr Hitler in committing atrocities against noncombatants"", his willingness to protect the heart of Japanese culture from atomic destruction, and his old age and frailty all mirror Suzuki's old age and the softer line of all the Japanese civilian leaders toward the war.
None of these similarities are allowed to obscure the contrasts between the two countries, in both politics and culture, which are laid out in wonderful complexity -- and, as far as this amateur historian can tell, with authenticity.  The movie is not against the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but, perhaps because its Canadian origins help provide some neutrality, it does not wrap Americans in protective clothing, either: they come off as human beings with both warts and strengths.
The second way in which the movie draws a common humanity is by including snippets of interviews with real-life soldiers and civilians from both sides.  Dramatically these interruptions feel awkward, and they introduce the feeling of a documentary into what is essentially a docudrama.  I think the movie pulls it off well enough, but there is no good way to include these interviews.  If you're patient, they add to your appreciation of the story; but keep in mind that the movie is essentially not about ordinary people but rather their leaders.
Bravo to the producers for using actors and film-makers from both sides.  I have always loved the Japanese sections of the film, and perhaps it means something that years after first watching it, the chief thing I remembered about it was the power of the Japanese language and the sympathetic humanity of the Japanese roles -- perhaps especially the warriors.  The portrayal of Army Minister Anami is especially unforgettable.",1067904000,18,4508,4.949668874172185
195911,2,1574920855,"The acting and production of this feature are all fine, but overall it presents a very kind image of Truman that I don't find supported in my knowledge of him and his presidency. It is often (wrongly) said that the atomic bombs felled on Japanese *civilians* saved tens of thousands of American *soldiers'* lives. But that's a false way to frame the true nature of why hydrogen and plutonium bombs were used.
Truman and Byrnes (his hard-liner sec. of state) lamented Germany's surrender before the bomb was ready, because then they could not justify its use on a defeated enemy. THAT is why Japan would be their victims; and there, too, they avoided negotiating peace and an end to war. THAT prolongation is what *cost* US and Japanese lives.
The atomic bombings served PRIMARILY as displays of military power by the US government to its counterparts of the USSR. The bombing date was moved-up on schedule because Truman feared and wanted to pre-empt the Red Army's move from victory in Manchurian (China, where the Japanese had occupied for a decade) to the islands.
Harry Truman is romanticized as a courageous, conflicted leader who ultimately made a tough decision in the best interest of his people and the world. That idea brings to mind one entry in his journal: 'May have Jap Emperor at Potsdam'... 'Will certainly have them when Manhattan appears over their homeland' (paraphrased). ""Manhattan"" being of course, the Manhattan Project - the development of nuclear explosives. Truman kept saying that ""unconditional surrender"" was the only acceptable terms, though the enemy's contention was on having Hirohito stay in power as the icon of Japan's government, culture, and history. But, *after* the bombing had demonstrated the muscle the US government could flex and Japan relented on that point, ""unconditional!"" went to 'whatever, our point was made', and things beyond that were of far less concern.
We all know where the world went from there: The USSR & The USA competitively racing to build thousands of bombs, just a handful of which could destroy all life on Earth; China, England, France, Israel, have all since joined the insanity. Bitter rivals, India and Pakistan now have the same terrible potential for annihilation of one another, and pollution of our backyards. And Iran and North Korea want to develop their share, because they can plausibly claim a threat from Israel and/or the USA. (And Iraq, apparently, was not on such course of production.)
The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were crimes against humanity, bigger than 'war crimes'. WE, common people of the world, must realize that nuclear weapons cannot merely ""fall"" into the wrong hands of people who would MIS-use them; rather, ANYONE who has them is the wrong people who would USE them, for they threaten OUR WORLD entire.
And it will be up to us common people of the world to stop these mad, reckless, ambitious vultures who run our world and plan our demise.",1063584000,14,2950,4.973684210526316
195912,5,1574920855,"This DVD release is entirely welcomed. HIROSHIMA was a gripping docu-drama when it was aired on Showtime Networks a few years ago. The producers and writers obviously spent a great deal of time researching the topic, and the effect of seeing history unfold is awing. The portrayals are quite believable, and, each time I watch it, I find myself--once again--tensely awaiting the flight of the Enola Gay....",1062720000,8,406,5.074626865671642
195913,5,1574920855,"This is a magnificent film.  It carefully documents the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan from both perspectives: that of the United States, and that of Japan.  The film makes no moral judgments: it simply brings out the dilemmas of both sides.  President Truman wanted to end the war with a minimum of casualties, but with the Japanese defeated.  The Japanese, whose government was controlled by fanatical militarists, were unable to reach a consensus that surrender was inevitable and that the war was lost.  They dithered and continued their infighting.
Meanwhile American and Japanese war casualties continue. Truman receives a sobering briefing about the horrific casualties anticipated to occur from the invasion of Japan, as the plans for this move forward. As Prime Minister Churchill said to President Roosevelt: how will you ever explain to the American people that the invasion could have been avoided by the use of this weapon, and that you could have saved the lives of thousands of their sons?  Truman had no answer, and events proceeded inexorably towards the use of the weapon in order to end the war.
This is hard-hitting, realistic, and deeply moving history, sympathetically presented without much in the way of political axe-grinding.  Both sides are shown with dignity.  World War Two is shown for what it was: a catastrophe that cost millions of lives and untold destruction.  The decision to use the atom bomb is also shown for what it was, as Truman put it: ""a decision that King Solomon himself would have had trouble making.""
Ultimately the film makes no ultimate judgment about the wisdom of America's decision to use the bomb.  The viewer is left to decide.
Despite its weighty topic, this film is highly entertaining and is a pleasure to watch, although its tone is deadly serious.  You will likely watch this one more than once.",1036627200,13,1866,4.967845659163987

195917,5,1574920855,"Remarkable ""made-for-cable"" docudrama, easily one of the highest-quality productions I have seen in a ""TV movie.""  Fascinating if you care about turning points of modern history (which tend to affect us all, care or not).  The story begins April 12, 1945 (one of those Infamous Dates in the US, like December 7, 1941 and November 22, 1963, and more recently, of course, September 11, 2001) and continues beyond Truman's ""Rain of Ruin"" speech in August, heard live around the world, declaring in essence that the Second World War would soon end and that the era of nuclear terrors had begun.
At the time, that first point made a much deeper impression than the second on the 12 million people in US armed services who were expecting a long and bloody invasion of Japan.  After years of a war not of their country's choosing, they had thought that the worst remained ahead.  It was also a war with a history of atrocities committed in the name of Japan against civilians and military prisoners in several Pacific-Asian countries.  The peoples of those countries remember (some of them have told me first-hand) even if others prefer not to learn.  Goldstein, in the photographic history _Rain of Ruin_ (ISBN 1574880330), which this film partly parallels, argues that selective awareness of the many horrors in the Pacific war is a factor impeding perspective today.  Another factor is modern ""Japanese history books [with] very little about World War II, its origins and progress ... One gains the impression that modern Japanese history begins with the atomic bomb ... leaving conveniently vague the chain of events"" before it.
Truman spoke August 6 (midmorning in the Americas, afternoon and evening in continental Eurasia, and midnight August 6-7 in Japan).  A great many people worldwide were awake and had access to radios. One of them was my father, a GI in France, having a glass of wine in the restaurant on the Eiffel Tower.  To the serving US soldiers, Truman's words were profound; it was as if their futures had been handed back to them.  ""We then had several more glasses of wine.""
This film stresses intrigues and negotiations in the US and Japanese governments near the end of the war.  A few scenes echo the spate of Manhattan-Project documentary in the 1980s that commenced with the great film _The Day After Trinity_ and extended to TV movies, mini-series, and books.  It's rich in complexities and details (some of them recently available) absent from lesser documentaries and from popular treatments like Hersey's or Hachiya's books.  Central is the struggle of clear-headed Japanese civil and court officials, and some in the military, who were ready to accept peace terms even before the atomic bombings, but feared a seizure of power by military leaders (who had a strong hand in the government anyway, by the constitution at that time).  The production is a collage of re-enactment, wartime footage, and recent interviews with people bearing witness, from Hiroshima residents to Clark Clifford to Edward Teller.  It is tied together with narration, sometimes poignant, in subtitles.
There was little US involvement in this film.  It came from parallel production teams in Canada and Japan (reminiscent of _Tora, Tora, Tora,_ which had a US rather than Canadian team, but also for which the 1995 film could possibly be seen as a very apt sequel.)  As with TTT (despite the break with Kurusawa in that film and the subsequent omission of most of his footage) the Japanese unit is superb, with sensitive, nuanced portrayals of key figures such as Kido (Kei Sato), War Minister Gen. Korechika Anami (Kohji Takahashi), and the new Prime Minister ex-Adm. Bn. Kantaro Suzuki (Tatsuo Matsumura).  (For some reason, even such a comprehensive source as the IMDB currently omits most of the Japanese cast.)  They got a good ringer for the young emperor too.  But also, the Canadian team succeeded in something notoriously hard: a faithful portrayal of Truman complete with mannerisms and rough edges (Kenneth Welsh).  He and they deserve enormous applause, for this has scarcely ever been achieved (it is the film equivalent of getting a good blue fire in fireworks).  Truman, the new, politically chosen vice president to FDR, left out of executive activity until FDR's sudden death, was a statesman conscious of his responsibilities before history, but he also had a crude streak, illustrated in his offhand dismissal of Stalin (who was not even Russian) as a ""little Russian twerp.""
At one point in the film Marquis Kido (one of the pivotal figures) asks Prince Konoye to go to Russia to persuade Stalin to mediate with the Americans. Kido pushes his servants from the room, prompting Konoye's observation ""it's rather bourgeois to abuse one's servants, Kido!""  Kido complains ""your servants probably aren't someone else's spies.""
If you've seen _Tora, Tora, Tora_, you remember the slow building of tension while Wesley Addy, as the Navy crypto officer, makes the rounds of Washington at night delivering intercepts of impending trouble, chauffeured by his wife, who presses him with limited success for hints of what's up (the ""look, step on it, dear"" scene).  Addy reappears in this 1995 film as Secretary of War Stimson, especially in a crucial argument with Groves, vetoing Kyoto as a nuclear target.
Naval aviator Capt. Mitsuo Fuchida, the Japanese military hero who managed to be on the scene at both Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima, is among those who have remarked that Japan tried to develop atomic bombs and would certainly have used them if successful.  Goldstein points out ""it is possible to pity the victims of the atomic bombs without attempting to rewrite history"" to suit one's preferences.  As far as I can tell, this 1995 film is faithful to that goal.",1017360000,23,5780,5.0135841170323925
