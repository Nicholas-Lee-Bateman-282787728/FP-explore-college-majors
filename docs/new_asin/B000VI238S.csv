8218677,5,B000VI238S,"My girlfriend loves Disney Princesses, and this set was great to start her collection. Has Princess Stories Vol. 1, Sing Along Songs Vol. 1, & Princess Party Vol. 1.",1469404800,,165,4.724137931034483
8218678,2,B000VI238S,The product picture does not match the DVD set I received...very deceiving,1425945600,2,74,5.25
8218679,1,B000VI238S,"I would not know the quality of these DVDs as I have been unable to view them as they are region specific, and my equipment is not set for the US. To be honest I was a little disappointed from the outset as I had thought from the title that there might be one or a few of the Disney movies in the box set but alas not!",1367193600,3,318,3.6911764705882355
8218680,5,B000VI238S,Great price & as new as can be (for a used product).  My granddaughter loves this set.  It's more special as it's a 3 DVD set.,1354752000,,126,3.8076923076923075
8218681,1,B000VI238S,"This 3 set DVD is NOT at all the quality I expected for the money.  There is really only 1 DVD worth watching out of the 3.  Only 1 has princess ""stories"" which are of average caliber - no special animation etc.
The other 2 dvds are a waste as they are not movies/stories but rather ""games"" you can play at a b-day party - which I must say are not practical.

I would not recommend this set to anyone else.  Basically there are 3 ""average"" princess ""stories"" and that is it.",1265846400,9,474,4.119565217391305
