976073,4,6305168822,Sandra Bullock was able to execute and deliver this difficult role.  I think that this movie was great.  Not everyone can be completely romantic...which makes the actions of the characters more real.  I  recommend the movie to everyone.  Viewers who gave this movie one star  think that the definition of a love story is nothing but hardcore sex.,917568000,,346,4.879310344827586
976074,1,6305168822,A thin plot that dragged on without any redemption in the end. Bought it for my wife as a stocking stuffer on christmas. Would have been easy to find a much better movie. If you were entertained by this then you  obviously are easily entertained. Not one of Sandra Bullocks better movies.  The effort was a waste of her talents.,914803200,5,328,4.45
976075,4,6305168822,"What I liked best was the setting.  Could say there is some bias.  Filmed in my home town, Sandra and Harry acted right at home and fit right in during the filming. The story line touched on many of the small town themes  personally observed over the years...from football hero marrying  cheerleader queen, to the big divorce, to many who came home for help in  raising small children, to finding there is lots of happiness in life even  when we don't live up to our own expectations.  If you grew up and love a  small town anywhere, Hope Floats may make you homesick.",912384000,,568,4.446601941747573

976822,5,6305168822,"HOPE FLOATS is a family drama, mostly taking place in Smithville, Texas, a small country town.  The film takes place in the current era, with actors Sandra Bullock (dumpee), Michael Pare (dumpor), Harry Connick (new love interest), and Mae Whitman (daughter caught the middle of divorcing parents).  Actress Connie Ray plays middle aged woman with delightfully Texan mannerisms.  After the split-up, Bullock and her daughter move away from Chicago, leaving the philandering husband behind, and move to Bullock's childhood home in Texas.  The movie starts out at a television talk show, where Sandra Bullock and her best friend (played by Rosanna Arquette) are featured guests.  The television hosts draws out the sleazy information from the best friend.  Bullock's character is named Birdee Pruitt.  Then, after Bullock learns the news of her unfaithful husband, the husband is brought out onto the stage, and the TV audience boos at him and turns their thumbs down.  The next scene starts with Bullock and her young daughter arriving in Smithville, Texas, to live with Bullock's mother, played by Gena Rowlands.

The plot moves along quickly, because various of the townsfolk fondly remember Sandra Bullock's character from their high school days.  Actually, one of the townsfolk does NOT have fond memories of Bullock from high school. This is actress Dee Hennigan (owner of employment agency), who has bad memories of Bullock's character, because she'd been mistreated and looked down upon by Bullock, in their high school days.  After Sandra Bullock spends several minutes at the employment agency (owned by actress Dee Hennigan), the fact comes to light that Bullock has some amateur experience in photography, and as a result, Hennigan finds a job for Bullock in a photo processing shop.

As the lively plot moves along, various relationships materialize and develop.  These include, Bullock and her mother (Gena Rowlands), Bullock and Connick (a carpenter and new love interest), Bullock and her new employer (elderly manager of 1-hour photo processing shop), and Bullock and Connie Ray (customer at the 1-hour photo processing shop).  At the same time, Bullock's daughter Mae Whitman develops new relationships with her school friends, or more accurately, acquires new enemies from her schoolmates, in particular, a massively obese girl played by actress Rachel Snow.  Mae Whitman's character wears eyeglasses, and Rachel Snow taunts her, calling her ""bookworm,"" ""popeye,"" and ""four eyes.""  Eventually, Rachel Snow chases after Mae Whitman, pushes her to the ground, and sits on her, while surrounded by a dozen or so other school children who have joined in the fray, out of curiosity.

COMEDIC ELEMENTS AND STRESS.  The movie provides comedic elements, in the fact that Bullock repeatedly has trouble with the photoprocessing machine at work.  On three occasions, we see that the machine is creating color prints that are totally black.  On one of these malfunctions, the photos from Connie Ray's wedding are ruined.  On a couple of occasions, the machine jams up causing a traffic-jam buildup of photographic prints.  Another source of comedy, is that the mother (Gena Rowlands) has decorated her house with the work of a taxidermist, that is, stuffed wild animals, as well as some domestic cats.  But an on-going current of stress is prevalent throughout the movie, namely, the fact that the daughter (Mae Whitman) gets increasingly stressed and strident about the fact that she loves her father and wants to return to Chicago to be with him.  Ultimately, what happens at the end of the movie is (don't worry, I do not tell what happens).

SOUTHERN-DRENCHED SCENE WITH CONNIE RAY.  Connie Ray plays Bobbi-Claire Patterson, who sports a ""big hair"" type hair style popular in the south, and who has semi-southern roots (attended college in North Carolina).  A particularly charming scene occurs when she drops off some film from her sister's wedding, at the processing shop where Sandra Bullock works. A second scene occurs immediately after that, where she picks up the photographs, but most were ruined.  The charm is in the acting, and in the clever dialogue (you need to read in between the lines).  This scene starts 45 minutes into the movie:

The door opens to the photo processing shop.  ""Well, if it isn't Bertie Calvert,"" exclaims Connie Ray.  ""Bobbie-Claire Atkins,"" exclaims Bullock.  ""Patterson now,"" replies Connie Ray.  ""How ARE you, I heard about your sad news,"" says Connie Ray to Bullock.  ""How Bill could humiliate you like that in front of the entire world is just beyond me,"" exclaims Connie Ray merrily.  ""We have a satellite dish so we got to watch it twice, once Central and once Mountain.  You poor thing.""  (You can see the zany dialogue, where Connie Ray is happy and merry, and at the same time is expressing sympathy, and at the same time is torturing Bullock by spewing details about the TV talk show where the infidelities of Bullock's husband were revealed to the world.)

""What can I do for you,"" says Bullock.  ""Anyway, I brought you these, my sister's wedding reception.""  Then Connie Ray exclaims, ""I just love this thing you're doing with your hair.  It's so down to earth and natural-like.  I wish I could be more like that,"" gushes Connie Ray.  ""I'm fealress that way,"" says Bullock calmly.  Connie Ray leaves the photo shop.

The photo printing machine makes loud groaning and clonking noises.  ""Noooo, no-no-no.  What's the matter with you, you big piece of crap,"" says Bullock, expressing calm annoyment. Then, Connie Ray comes in to pick up her pictures, and sees the mess of ruined photos.  ""I'm sorry Bobby-Clair,"" says Bullock.  ""SORRY?  YOU THINK THAT DOES IT?  THOSE PICTURES WERE IRREPLACEABLE.""  Bullock calmly explains, ""When I was loading the paper must have gotten stuck in the gate.""  ""THERE'S NOTHING, THAT'S NOT EVEN A BLUR,"" exclaims Connie Ray.  Then, Bullock tries to rationalize the damaged pictures, ""Wasn't that her fourth wedding"" referring to Connie Ray's sister.  ""It was her fifth wedding, Mrs. High-and-Mighty!!!  Now, there's nothing to show for it.""  Bullock calmly says, ""At least I caught it before the others got ruined.""

THEATRICALLY MATURE.  Another ongoing theme, is the mature and realistic depiction of Bullock's relationship with Connick.  She is hesitant to go on a date with him (because although dumped, she is still married), and she is hesitant to let him touch her (for much the same reason), and on the one hand agrees to dance with him at the local country & western dance hall, but refuses to have dinner with him.  The viewer is left unsure about the direction between the relationship between Bullock and Connick, until the last minute or so of the movie (don't worry, I do not tell what happens).

FAMILIAR AND TIME-TESTED STORY ELEMENTS.  The storyline travels over familiar territory, that is, a philandering father, a victimized mother, and child caught in the middle.  Most of the story takes place in the south, where the local southern color mainly takes the form of actress Connie Ray.  This local southern color, together with the country & western music, adds pizzazz to the story.  Yes, have all seen other movies about unfaithful fathers who wreck their own family, leaving a child in distress.  And yes, we have all seen movies that exploit the use of  ""southern charm"" to ensure viewer interest.  An example is MURPHY'S ROMANCE with Sally Field and James Garner.  Yet another movie where charm is provided by southern-drenched habits, is SHE GETS WHAT SHE WANTS starring Piper Perabo.  And yet another movie where charm is provided by southern habits and customs is NORTH, starring Elijah Wood and Bruce Willis.

But in the same way that there will always be another new recording of Bach's Brandenberg Concertos, there will always an interest for one more movie about a divorcing family, and there will always be interest in yet another movie that acquires its charm from southern culture.  As with compositions by Bach, the story of divorcing couples (and stories in the American south) will always be worthy of re-telling, with additional nuances.",1493683200,,8164,5.083458646616541

Gena Rowlands, Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick, Jr. and the kids were great, but the most astonishing performance was by Mae Whitman (Bernice).  She was simply incredible.

979043,5,6305168822,"Hope Floats is vintage movie whose story never goes out of date because there broken marriages everywhere you look.  Sandra Bullock as Birdie Pruitt, the discarded wife, and Harry Connick Jr. as Justin give a heartfelt performance as two people struggling to find their way.  Birdie and her daughter, Bernice, played by Mae Whitman (outstanding for a child), have to move back home to mom's house.  Gena Rowlands once again gives an outstanding interpretation of Bullock's mother.  Rowland is one of our unsung actresses and doesn't get the accolades she so deserves.

Birdie has had all the luxuries a woman could want in her marriage to Bill (Michael Pare') and is in for a rude awakening when she realizes that the marriage is over between her and the rat.  She has huge struggles coming to terms with the situation but the real star of the show is Bernice.  Of course, a child cannot begin to come to terms with the fact that her father could possible not want her anymore and blames her mother for her daddy turning his back on her.

This movie is full of humor, soft romance, heartache and realizing life is not all sunshine and roses.  Forest Whitaker did an excellent undertaking of directing this movie and the cast was beautifully chosen, with a chemistry between each character.  Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks both sing the Billy Joel song To Make You Feel My Love, spot on for this movie.",1441929600,5,1403,4.713114754098361

979387,5,6305168822,"This is the greatest love story. Truth about emotions and life itself is threaded all through. I think it would be suited for children over 8, but that's my humble opinion. There is no sex, closest word to profane is ""shucks"". The main thread is to love while you can. While you can. It will make most of you cry. Harry Connick is so authentic, even in off hand gestures and his portrayal of awkward approach scenarios he will just make you feel good.
What can be said for Sandra Bullock. Her acting skills from shunned and betrayed Supergirl housewife to the adjusted and tender hearted mom is just what you need. I really don't see how anybody but a cold blooded scoundrel wouldn't be totally  Blessed by this movie.

980757,3,6305168822,"Released in 1998, ""Hope Floats"" is a likable drama about Birdee Pruitt (Sandra Bullock) who flees with her daughter (Mae Whitman) back to her small home town in Texas to live in her mother's mansion while her father is in a nursing home (Gene Rowlands plays the mother). Birdee is disillusioned because her husband (Michael Par) left her for her best friend in Chicago. Both she and her daughter have to come to grips with what's happened while a cowboy carpenter takes interest in Birdee (Harry Connick Jr.). A peripheral issue is that Birdee was the beloved prom queen in high school and her husband the popular quarterback.

I was expecting a great drama with ""Hope Floats"" but it wasn't to be. The film was directed by amiable Forest Whitaker (Cuffey in ""North & South"") and written by Steven Rogers. There's nothing wrong with the cast, soundtrack, direction or locations; the problem lies with the screenplay. It's just too by-the-numbers. I'd give obvious examples but I don't want to give away the story for those who haven't seen it, although I wouldn't actually be giving anything away because the script's so predictable.

Nevertheless, it's worth checking out for those who like dramas, the cast and country music. It was a mild hit at the box office in 1998.

The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Smithville, La Grange and Austin, Texas, with opening scenes in Chicago.

The rest of the movie is encouraging, although many who have gone or are going through what birdie went through don't find happiness in the end. But it is a delightful movie and I have recommended it to my friends. There is no violence, no foul language and no sex. Wow can this be true.

982123,4,6305168822,"There have been lots of reviews of this movie and there isn't much new I can add to them except for this: the video of Garth Brooks singing ""To Make You Feel My Love"". That video was included on the VHS release of Hope Floats but was mysteriously left off the DVD release. I'm afraid to buy the Blu-Ray because I fear they have left it off again. What a marvelous video! A hauntingly beautiful song...sung by one of the great performers of the country music revival of the mid/late 1980's and into the 1990's...a song that fit the move perfectly and a video that provided a real showcase for Garth's substantial talent. Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick, Jr., made a great pairing as a potential couple and each managed to skillfully portray a character with conflicts and hurts resulting from a complicated situation, and best of all they did it convincingly. If you like movies where the characters are struggling to fall in love and if you also like good music, this will give you both things at the same time. Without the Garth Brooks video it's a really entertaining movie...with the video, it becomes even more entertaining.",1402876800,,1129,4.678391959798995

I love everything else about this movie, but the little girl is such an incredible brat and lacks any discipline whatsoever! I understand that she is going through a very difficult and life changing time, but her sour attitude towards everyone is disgusting and she makes her mother's situation much worse!! She idolizes her father even though she knows he broke her mother's heart. Her mother is going through Hell and that child couldn't care less. She blamed her mom for all of their problems even though it was her jerk of a father that destroyed their family and she knew it.

I would have INSTANTLY gotten up out of my seat, grabbed my Daughter out of the front row and pulled her OUT of the studio with me!!  Instead Bullock's character SAT there like a MORON throughout the whole humiliating incident!!  And NO TV show is going to DO that, ESPECIALLY  with her CHILD in the audience!!!  That was absolutely UNREALISTIC.... there's one HELLUVA Lawsuit she could have had against them, for that.  That whole thing didn't even make SENSE and was lower mentality than a B MOVIE!!  I did not put ""SPOILER"" warning becaise this is the FIRST thing seen in the film right after the opening credits..... so it's NOT a 'spoiler'.  And there is NO commentary, NO extra features at all, which it does say before buying, but sometimes that is not true........ this time it IS and that's very disappointing.

Along with the superb acting by the main adult and child characters, the storyline itself is one that makes you want to watch it again and again.  It is a poignant look at the journey out of depression as well as a journey towards healthy self esteem.  This is accomplished in a light hearted way that only an outstanding actor like Sandra Bullock could pull off.  The movie is also full of messages about self acceptance, self awareness.  The main component of the movie is the beautifully acted and directed story telling of the metamorphosis and growth process that this ex-beauty queen, ex-wife, mother, daughter, and woman experiences as she goes through the valleys life unexpectedly throws at her.  It is about a woman that chooses to move forward and live her own life as opposed to living a life dictated by others and through others.  All this and more is found in this movie without being in the least bit preachy. It is a must see for all Sandra Bullock and Harry Connik, Jr. fans.",1379289600,,1029,4.559782608695652

What if there is a movie which I can't stand, but I purchase it as a gift for a family member? Would it be fair to give this purchase a 1 star rating just because I can't stand the movie? No, it would not. Just like I think it's stupid for people to give a 1GB capacity player low stars because it can't hold 10,000 songs, it's not fair to give a movie I don't like a low star rating here. So, all that being said, I don't personally like this movie. I like Sandra, and really enjoy many of her movies, I.E. Speed, The Net, but this one didn't do it for me. However the purchase experience here on Amazon was superb. I ordered this movie for Christmas for a family member and it was delivered as expected, on time, the right packaging, ETC.

When all is said and done, the child is the one who suffers the most.  Of course, there is the ""good guy"" played by Harry Connick, Jr. who steps up and makes her realize that true love does exist if you keep hoping and open your heart.  Kinda sappy, I know.

983825,4,6305168822,"With the exception of a couple of her earlier films, Sandra Bullock is movie gold. If she's in it you know it's going to be good.  This film is more proof of that.

Growing up in a small town, Birdee Pruitt (played by Bullock) was something special. The pretty and popular girl who got the boy who was the popular football hero. They married, had a daughter and in a few years life came crashing down around her.  Turns out she married an ass who was having an affair with their next door neighbor, who (Birdee thought) was her best friend. And they picked the worst way possible to break the news to her -- blindsiding her on national tv.

Birdee has no college, no job experience, no husband, no best friend - and so she heads home to moms with daughter in tow, to try to get her bearings and figure out what to do next.

Naturally, the whole town saw (or heard of) the whole humiliating tv show - and many of them seem to take pleasure in watching the girl who had it all, fall on her face.  With encouragement (and a shove or two) from her mom, Birdee does her best to cope and get on with life... and Bullock expertly takes us emotionally right there with her through it all as she ""gets a little of her own back"" and bravely forges a new life.

Her daughter and her sister's boy (living with her mom) are wonderful stories of their own within the movie and absolutely wonderful little actors (the little girl should've won some type of award really), and Gena Rolands just shines throughout the movie as the quirky, sunny mom. [As always, Harry Connick, Jr. absolutely sucks as an actor - but the movie manages to still be good in spite of him.]

It's a wonderful story with heart and a good ending (as all of Bullock's films seem to have).  Would have to classify this as a ""chick flick"" (not likely to be on most men's top 10 lists), but well done.  I've enjoyed this MANY MANY times and the magic formula still holds true - if Bullock is in it it's going to be a good movie. Enjoy!",1344902400,,1990,4.254641909814324

She's reunited with a classmate who had a crush on her in high school(and still does).  The rest of the movie follows them spending time together, her being tentative about a new relationship, and a gratuitously goofy scene meant to tug at your heartstrings with the cast lip-syncing; it's just far too obvious.  The best part of this movie revolves around the daughter; she's bullied in school, missing her father and actually makes us feel her emotional pain.

Much has changed over the years, including Birdie, and she must learn to adjust to those changes.

There is a heart wrenching scene when her daughter wants to go with the child's father and he refuses to take her. This scene, arguably, was the best acted, best emotional tear-jerking scene of the movie. My heart just broke for that little girl.

After that, though, this was nothing more than a silly feel-good romantic movie. Connick is handsome and humorous as always, smooth. Bullock is everything you'd expect her to be too. The romance happens too soon after the divorce, or perhaps in this case while it's still pending, but other than that, the couple cultivates an interesting adversarial romance between them.

Birdie learns to accept the simple things in life, to trust herself and open up her heart again... not bad, overall, for a romantic movie with a touch of comedy a la Connick, Jr.",1320624000,2,1155,4.88265306122449

The story moves briskly along and one finds oneself in Smithville, Texas where Birdie Pruitt, played by Sandra Bullock, has returned to recover from a publicly humiliating TV experience which results in the breakup of her marriage.

Birdie and her daughter Bernice, very well played by Mae Whitman, find themselves having to make the adjustment from Chicago to a very small Texas town. Mae Whitman's performance as the daughter, Bernice, provides one of the key anchor rolls that hold this movie together.

The movie does a good job of projecting the ambience of a small Texas town and the key roles are all well acted. Harry Connick, Jr. as Justin Matisse, the ""house painter,"" seems real in his role as one who really cares about Birdie. Gena Rowlands as Ramona Calvert, Birdie's mother, brings a sparkle to the film and Sandra Bullock does a fine job as the distraught Birdie Pruitt.

984033,5,6305168822,"Sandra Bullock does a wonderful job as Birdee Pruitt, a woman who has the rug pulled out from under what she thinks is her idyllic existence as a homemaker on national television when her so-called best friend, luring Birdee on a Ricki Lake-type show for what she believes is a free makeover, announces she has been having an affair with Birdee's husband, Bill. An affair he has precious little remorse about.

Humiliated and reeling, Birdee takes their daughter, Bernice, from the home she and Bill shared in Chicago and goes back home to Smithville, Texas, where Birdee sheepishly reminds her daughter she was ""Queen of Corn"" for three years straight. In Texas, where she was once a big fish in a small pond, Birdee hopes to lick her wounds. Once home, she reacquaints herself with her mother, Ramona, a somewhat offbeat woman played with zest by Gena Rowlands. (A classic line from her when she asks Birdee why she was on TV and Birdee answers, ""I just wanted a free makeover"" and Ramona responds, ""Well you got one!"" was superbly delivered.) She also reconnects with her nephew, Travis, being raised by his grandmother while Birdee's sister tries to make it as an actress in California. Travis acts out his abandonment issues in an odd fashion, in costumes and as various characters, which Ramona handles with equanimity, likely since she is a bit off center herself.

In the midst of Birdee's humiliation and misery comes some matchmaking by her mother when old friend - and someone who crushed on Birdee from afar when in school - Justin Matisse drops by. Justin, played by Harry Connick, Jr, is a salt-of-the-earth type architect/construction worker. He clearly still has deep-seeded feelings for Birdee, feelings she is ill equipped to handle. Bernice does not handle the entrance of Justin into their lives well, secretly hoping for her parents to reconcile.

What follows is a languid, slow-paced tale of Birdee wallowing in pity until Ramona sets her straight. When trying to find a job with almost no skills, some former classmates Birdee looked down upon waste no time in slyly rubbing her nose in it. Bullock plays a chagrined Birdee to perfection, making you feel for her and hoping she can get herself together. Along the way, a flirtation with Justin slowly turns into more, despite Birdee's continued antipathy about her marriage. Connick holds his own with Bullock, and I thought they had remarkable chemistry. One of the best scenes in the film is when Justin and Birdee dance. Connick and Bullock apparently trained with Patsy Swayze, and likely did her proud. They clearly looked like they were having a blast. The subsequent scene at the house Justin brings Birdee to, one he is building, is very romantic and gentle. Those adjectives sum up the relationship quite well.

Of course, no would-be romance would be complete without conflict, and, as mentioned, Bernice's resistance provides plenty. Mae Whitman as Bernice was compelling. She played a child of divorce achingly well, and even when acting out, you could see the hurt underneath it. The scene between her and Michael Par was gut wrenching when Bill would not take his daughter home with him. Alas, the only flaw seems to be that Bill is shallowly characterized, the heartless guy who has no qualms about abandoning his family. But since it does happen, I can't be too harsh here.

Add in other issues, such as Birdee's father battling the heartbreak of Alzheimer's disease and Ramona's eventual fate (I won't spoil it), and I admit, it is not always a ""light"" movie. But the romance keeps it from being too maudlin, and the family dynamic is as real as it gets. This is not to say there is no fun. See the aforementioned dancing...as well as a sweet scene as three generations of women - Ramona, Birdee, and Bernice have a little fun with ""I Can't Get Next To You.""

Forest Whitaker does a credible job as director here. Overall, this movie seems to be about a woman's journey from long-time appendage to finding her own way, and it was handled deftly. Indeed, to be honest, it was about...hope. Hope for a new future, hope for a new life, and hope for new love with the one who always loved her.

The romantic in me really,  truly loved it for those reasons. If you like the theme of ""second chances"" and romance with ""the one who almost got away"", I cannot recommend this movie enough. I think it is honestly among Sandra Bullock's best movies and deserved *much* more success and respect than it received!",1287964800,8,4492,4.794573643410852

984139,3,6305168822,"Sandra Bullock made this movie long before her name was linked in the news not with her richly deserved Oscar but with her philandering husband. This fictional version starts with an unfaithful spouse and in Birdee(Bullock)'s most despairing days, offers a possible new romance (with Harry Connick, Jr. Imagine THAT man singing to you . . . yum). Returning home after her husband dumps her on national TV, Birdee must rebuild her life amid ridicule from everyone in her hometown. Once a snooty homecoming queen, she must now grovel to people she once lorded over. The part is difficult -- believable ex-snooty, believable depression, believable painful recovery -- and Bullock does it well. Directed with grace by Forest Whitaker, it also stars Gena Rowlands -- who always makes a movie better -- playing the part of Birdee's eccentric taxidermist mother whose quirky ways and no-nonsense parenting are infuriating and hilarious. The one to watch, though, is Mae Whitman in the part of Birdee's daughter, Bernice. Today she's probably best known as Amber in Parenthood but even in 1998 she was wonderful and vulnerable and funny. Sandra Bullock's character has believable non-treakly relationships with both. Yes, it's a romantic comedy, a chick flick, a girl film.

It boasts a fine cast but the script is so sappy and predictable that it doesn't make good use of them.  I have liked Sandra Bullock in everything else I've seen her in but here she seems awfully lackluster.  Harry Connick Jr is wonderful to look at.  Again his part is so goofy; he had a crush on the high school star and he's still worshipping her.  There's nothing to believe that he has grown since high school or that he sees her as an adult--not just the girl he idolized back then.  So we're supposed to believe that this will be the romance that will work for them, unlike the marriage she's just left.  It's not very realistic but it is rather pleasant and there's nothing to really hate here...except the daughter.  Someone make a count of how many 10 year old girls written into movie scripts who either have freckles, frizzy hair or glasses and terrible names, who we are supposed to adore because they are so uncute.

I deeply connected to this movie because I was in a very unhappy first marriage to my high school sweetheart, i was 25 and had a young daughter. This movie made me realize that I could NOT be the only one in my marriage to make it work.  I realized that it was unhealthy, and it was time for me to move on with my life, and that wasn't a bad thing. So basically, this movie gave me the strength and insight to move on.  I think this movie depicted very acurately the stages of grief that i went through while my marriage was breaking apart. I still think this is one of Sandra Bullock's best films. I loved every actor in this movie. Harry Connick was sensational, Gena Rowland is perfect, and the little girl who played Bernice did exceptionally well. The scene where she wants to go with her dad was sooo well acted, I couldn't believe this was a child acting.

984651,3,6305168822,"Hope Floats has a lot of sadness, but also a lot of humor and warmth.  It has too much drama to be put in the romance genre.  Sandra Bullock should have gotten an Oscar for her portrayal as Birdie, a former prom queen from a small Texas town whose marriage falls apart on national television.  Her range and depth of emotion are phenomenal.  Her young daughter is also an astonishing actress.  One scene in the film with her will absolutely break your heart.

Birdie returns to Texas to live with her mother and deal with the aftermath.  Her daughter Beatrice blames Birdie for her father leaving.  Birdie's old friend (Harry Connick Jr.) tries to coax her out of her depression and into a state where she can find some hope.  Birdie's mother is raising her grandson.

984652,4,6305168822,"I really shouldn't like this movie but I do.  However, I gave it four stars SOLELY because of the acting and soundtrack. Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick Jr. were fantastic to watch and the music was a delight to listen to if you like pop-country.  If the director had casted any other actors for the roles, it definitely would have flopped.  Bullock and Connick have such an irrisistable charm about them that you can't help but love to watch them act.

 On the other hand, albeit a wonderful actress, Bullock's daughter in this movie was so irritating and unlikeable she spoiled the magic of the moment for me every time she appeared on screen.  I cringed when she opened her mouth.  I could see why her father didn't want her (just kidding...not really).  If I had been like her growing up my father would have driven off leaving me on the side of a road too.  The only redeeming aspect of the daughter's role was to show how difficult a divorce is on a child and how a mother's love will get them through.  In spite of unfairly being bombarded with insults and rejection (annoyingly throughout the ENTIRE movie) from her daughter, we saw a mother who will love and support her child no matter what.  Sorry fathers, the movie didn't portray you very well.

On another sour note, this movie lacked direction, character development, continuity, and any kind of substantial plot to follow.  Viewers are just along for the ride without one scene having much to do with another. Characters and scenes were thrown together with no rhyme or reason--seemingly, just to move the movie along to the end.  I found myself saying, ""Huh?"" a lot to aspects of the story that just didn't make sense.  Perhaps I blinked and missed something that provided a rational explanation.

There aren't enough bad things to say about this movie.  It is supposed to be a love story but all we see of the true romance is in the few remaining minutes of the movie. Forget this being a ""love"" story; it is more like a ""reject"" story: Husband rejects wife. Daughter rejects mother. Father rejects daughter. Woman rejects man. Town rejects man.  Town rejects woman. Daughter rejects man. Mother rejects son, etc.... With all this rejecting going on it's no wonder that the actual love part doesn't come out until the very end.

Director, Forrest Whitaker, ought to be ashamed of himself for dropping the ball on this one.  Although to be fair, I now understand that the studio pulled support during production and several key scenes weren't filmed. After Bullock put in her own money to get the film finished, they shot a make-shift ending and edited together the footage they had already filmed. Unfortunately, knowing why a movie is a mess doesn't make it any easier to watch.

In spite of itself, this movie is as charming as it is horrifically directed and edited.  For some reason (i.e., Bullock and Connick) it works.  I have watched this movie many times over and never tire of it.  You'll enjoy it too if you can suspend the movie critic within you and overlook the glaringly obvious megaholes in the storyline.  Just sit back and enjoy the sweet simplicity of this movie.  It's a 155-minute bumby ride but the 2-minute heartfelt emotional ending will definitely leave you emotionally fulfilled.",1153440000,2,3273,4.728395061728395

But as the show progresses, we discover that Hope's self-worth died the day she married her daughter's father, and that a mother's love--no matter how we perceive it as children--is truly a blessing in our lives. In the ends, there's much healing, a new romance, and a new lease on life. Guys...if you want to impress your woman...this is a chick flick to rent!",1149292800,3,704,4.595238095238095

984735,5,6305168822,"HOPE FLOATS, starring Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick, Jr., is a wonderful, moving story that strikes at the heart of what all such human interest stories should be.

Birdee Calvert returns home to rural Texas with her daughter after being betrayed by her husband and best friend and tries to pick up the pieces of what she believes is an irreversibly damaged life. Instead she discovers that the best of her and of life was there all along.

Gena Rowlands marvelously portrays Birdee's eccentric mother and the remaining cast is a potpourri of great faces, none showy enough to be out of place and all the likes of those that Norman Rockwell would have been proud to portray in one of his ""slice-of-life"" masterpieces.

THE HORSEMAN",1104969600,3,734,4.809523809523809
984736,5,6305168822,"""Hope Floats""--to me--is a ""cameo"" film worth viewing and having.  The story-line is about Birdee (Sandra Bullock) being scammed to appear on a TV sleaze show ostensibly to get a free makeover only to hear her best friend (yeah, sure) disclose that she's been having an affair with her husband for the last year!!!...then--rubbing rock salt in the wound--the husband comes on camera and confirms the shocker.

  The next we see of Birdee, she's packing the station wagon with the help of her elementary school daughter Bernice and they're off to Grandma's house in the small town where Birdee grew up in Texas--where they're ALL talking about it having seen (and recorded in some instances) the nationwide TV broadcast.  Being the main gossip even before Birdee arrives, she 1] gets her nose rudely rubbed in it, 2] her Mother's heartfelt but sometimes unfeeling advice to ""get on with your life"", 3] Bernice turns on Birdee with insinuations, then screaming ""It's all YOUR fault!"" adoring her father (for all the wrong reasons she finds out).  But WAIT!!!...do I hear a White Knight riding to the rescue?

  YES!!!...in the person of Jason Matesse, a highschool friend who's been carrying the torch for Birdee all these years.  Portrayed by Harry Connick Jr., he gently helps Birdee confront her self-pity/self-doubt/self-recrimation with smooth straight talk, knowingly (from his own experience?) guiding her back to being the girl he knew and the woman she was prior to the TV fiasco with tender and solicitous attention and the occasional confrontational scene, always being there for her AND letting her know how he feels about her.  (Witness the dance hall scene and call me a liar if you can!)

  OF COURSE Birdee is distraught, OF COURSE self-deceived Bernice goes bratty in the worst way, OF COURSE some of Birdee's old highschool girl chums can't help but try (jealously) to put ""Miss High'n'Mighty"" down but that's how things ARE in any social strata  when the chips are down--but for the true friends, Birdee's Mother, Jason Matesse, and a few others there for you come thick or thin.

  Everything comes clean at the end, with the tenderness, thoughtfulness, understanding, compassion, and basic true values being shown AND recommended to Birdee, almost everyone lives happily ever after. (I'm NOT telling.)

  I give Forest Whittaker--the director--Kudos for honing  Harry Conniker JR's performance as Jason; the depth, subtlety, and genuiness of his performance comes through LOUD and CLEAR, as do all the supporting roles in this film.  It has earned a Place Of Honor in my video collection, and I recommend it to you all: although rated PC13, I'd say General Audience as any intimacy--and there's very little--is all ""fade to black"" so what's the PC13 all about anyway?

The first thing is to get rid of the bratty kid who doesn't know what she has in a wonderful mom played by Sandara Bullock, but I guess that's because she's a kid who is an exception where most accept divorce as a way of life she's holding the mother accountable for the breakdown of the marriage, but she comes to her senses at the end when she sees the father is apologizing for nothing. It's her crying at the end that is fraying on the nerves though. The other thing is the fact that they omitted Live's ""Lightning Crashes"" from the movie soundtrack, and the movie itself. It's done in the preview, so why keep it out of the movie? As I said it's a good movie, but it could've been better.",1095638400,4,797,4.115384615384615
984738,3,6305168822,"Mae Whitman plays the adorable, if not bratty, daughter in this, Bernice. If you happen to come across a recent photo of her, my, hasn't she grown up?
Yet again, Sandra Bullock exectutive produces, and stars in, a film that she's done a million times over. She's got herself into a rut with the kind of roles she can play, and nothing can save her now. She's teamed up with yet another hunky man, this time Harry Connick Jnr, and although they hardly spend any 'quality' time together in the movie, there is one great scene where they dance together.
I hope soon that Sandra Bullock will shock us all with a role in a movie that isn't something she normally does. She's approaching 40 now, and should be expanding her horizons, so she can stay in the movie business once her pretty looks have gone. But nope, she churns out film after film, swapping guys and trying to make out she's still as popular. I'm holding out for the Miss Congeniality sequel - still one of my all time favourite films starring her.
Don't get me wrong, I love her films. The only one that's surprised me was Murder By Numbers, and that's probably cos I still can't understand it to this day.

984897,4,6305168822,"Sandra Bullock turns in a textured, nuanced performance in this bittersweet tale of loss, closure, and new beginnings.  After learning in a brutal fashion that her husband and her best friend have become lovers, Bullock returns to her small hometown in Texas, son in tow.  She ""goes home to Mother"",  re-instating a relationship that is close but with its share of the usual troubles and flaws.
  She finds that her high school boyfriend still retains strong feelings for her.  Slowly,  she learns to trust again,  as the two draw close.  The movie is saved from mediocrity by the strong performances of the three major characters who are able to convey feelings beyond what is spoken.  That said, I have taken from this movie a marvelous set of words in the following quotation:

  ""Beginnings are scary, and endings are generally sad, but it's what happens in  the middle that matters.""",1075161600,5,888,4.87248322147651
984898,4,6305168822,"""Hope Floats"" is a typical family drama. A young woman, played by Sandra Bullock, finds out that her husband is in love with her best friend...on a nationwide TV show. As a result, takes her daughter and moves back to her hometown, a small place in Texas, called Smithville. Living at her mother's house, she soon loses her nerves. Right at this moment, the attractive cowboy Justin comes along to win her heart.
What can I say about this movie? It's definitely entertaining and very well acted. Especially Gena Rowlands (as mother) and Mae Whitman (as daughter) are over the top.
But somehow something is missing in ""Hope Floats""...maybe it's just a bit too American for the taste of an average European.
Nevertheless...if you like this kind of movies, you should take a look at it. It's no mistake.",1064361600,2,800,4.762589928057554

Gena Rowlands is Fantastic as the Momma, Harry Connick Jr. is simply charming as the ""wanna be"" Beau, the actor that played ""Travis"" was adorable and heartwarming, Bernice (the daughter of Sandra Bullock in the movie) was casted very well she was perfect as a stubborn, hurt and confused little girl trying to deal with the divorce of her Beloved Daddy and her (now seen as the enemy) Momma. Of course I can not leave out Sandra Bullock I was impressed with her ability to portray the hurt and the recovery of a women who has sunk to depression after her husband has found another, a mother that is struggling to keep it together for her child and a daughter that comes home to a town and a Mother that remembers her in a certain light.
Forrest Whitaker did a tremendous job In my Honest Opinion with selecting this cast, creating scenes that make you feel all of what the characters are going through. From the Gena Rowlands character all the way to the children. I can not recommend this movie enough for anyone. Caution.... It's not light, there are some funny moments and there are some very sad moments. It deals with death, infidelity and parents neglecting their children.
I watched this with my 12 year old, she loved it!!! The soundtrack maybe hard to find but do yourself a favor FIND IT!! it is definately worth it. I had to finally find mine on auction sites and it can come pretty pricy brand new/sealed but still if I ever heard something worth the ticket price the soundtrack for this movie is one of them.
Also if you like this type of movie (with pretty much the same subject matter) check out ""Something to Talk About"" which stars Gena Rowland as the Momma as well.

984902,4,6305168822,"Forest Whitaker's directorial efforts pay off, as he presents the viewer with a solid, though predictable, romance. The ever charming and coltish Sandra Bullock gives a strong performance as Birdie Pruitt, who has just found out on national television that her husband Bill is having an affair with her erstwhile best friend, Connie. Shocked, she is left to cope with this very public betrayal.
Birdie takes their daughter, Bernice, and leaves her husband, returning to her small town roots in Smithville, Texas, where her mom, an eccentric but lovely lady, wonderfully played by Gena Rowlands, still lives. As a teenager, Birdie had been a big fish in a small pond, a popular high school cheerleader who had ended up marrying the high school star quarterback, Queen of Corn three years running, and the envy of most of the young women with whom she grew up. She now finds herself returning home with her tail between her legs, her fairy tale life having taken a decided nosedive.
While home, some of those who remember her manage to get their digs in. One person, however, a sensitive and sensual good ol' boy, Justin Matisse, played to sexy perfection by Harry Connick, Jr., remembers her with fond affection, as he has loved her since they were in high school. He is there, just waiting to pick up the pieces.",1041638400,7,1312,4.8097345132743365

Although the premise of the story is a bit cliche, it was a good way to open the movie. She moves back home with her daughter, and they live with her mother (played by Gena Rowlands excellently). Birdie gets over the devestation by realizing that her husband did not define her, and finds the courage to live again for her family. Harry Conick Jr. plays Justin, a past love of Birdie's, who also helps her out. The movie is deeply affirmed in the fact that hope will float again.

984978,2,6305168822,"In the 1998 summer season, ""Hope Floats"" was one of the romantic or dramatic pictures released as an antidote to the usual adrenaline junkie fare. Because of its cast and its advance publicity, it was a movie I really wanted to like....
While the framework of romantic movies may be small, there are still standards we expect them to meet. While ""Hope Floats"", it often comes dangerously close to capsizing. It is below par in almost every area.
One always elusive element is chemistry between the two main characters. Bogart and Becall had it, as did Tracy and Hepburn. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks had it in ""Sleepless in Seattle"". Sandra Bullock and Harry ConnickJr., don't have it. In part, this may be because Connick, with his New Orleans musician background, is fundamentally too sophisticated for Bullock, who was one of the film's producers. The rest of the problem is script related. Bullock's character has a lot of excess baggage, which interferes too often with the love affair. Connick plays a man that Bullock went to high school with. He was the first boy to kiss her. As written, she had almost no interest in him then. Since there seems to be nothing special about him now, he comes off as more of a last resort than as her one true love.
In today's society, the majority of people have gone through a divorce. Small children are increasingly included in romantic films. In ""Hope Floats"" Bullock has a daughter. When they go back to her home town to live with her mother, played by Gena Rowlands, we discover a little boy. He has been dumped there by Bullock's screen sister. This arrangement seems to be permanent. I have no problem with the inclusion of children in such a movie. In this case, we find ourselves focused on the lives of the children. Again, this is something caused by the unfocused script.
How fragmented is the story line? The answer is that the only way they could tie up all the loose ends was to end most dramatic scenes in ...[low cost] hackneyed music video fashion.
There are some good things about ""Hope Floats"". As the children, Mae Whitman and Cameron Finley give sterling performances. While both have had substantial acting experience, neither are old enough to know they are in a love story that doesn't work. Fort Smith, Texas, the setting for the movie, is a real town. It is handsomely photographed. Best of all, the picture runs less than two hours.",1017273600,5,2397,4.682464454976303
984979,3,6305168822,"OK, this will be short and sweet. I realize that this movie isn't an Oscar winner but it's not a bad little flick either.
 If for no other reason, you should see it because of Harry Connick Jr. Whoever says he can't act obviously doesn't understand the art. He plays the role of a gentle, confident (and dead sexy) cowboy with perfect charm and grace. He makes you want to swoon just by walking in the room.
 A cowboy was the LAST thing I ever thought I could go for, but if I could find one like ""Justin Matisse,"" I wouldn't hesitate!!",1015286400,9,536,4.245098039215686

The movie stars a mother, Sandra, who has just leaned, on national television no less, that her husband's been cheating on her. She leaves him and takes her young daughter, played by Mae Whitman, to live with her mother in her small hometown. She comes in contact, more often than she wants, with someone from her past. A guy to be exact. I won't ruin the ending, but overall she learns the hard way to overcome her fears and let go of the past hurts. Little Mae Whitman is adorable in this movie. While both stars were excellent, the reason I gave the movie a five-star rating was because of how close the plot comes to reality.

The good part about the film is the performance by Gena Rowlands.  What a diverse actress she is, and her portrayal of a woman who loves but shows it in detached ways is credible.
As for the ""real"" portion, having been through some of the life situations, I was pleased that they weren't undermined nor catastrophized.  What a pleasant surprise.  It's definitely a feel-good movie, and one that can break your heart for so many reasons.

She returns home to her eccentric taxidermist mother to date the man who loved her in high school.  The scenes were she tries to find a job and reconcile with the people in her past are particularly good, and the scene between her daughter and her ex husband was very emotional.

The portrayal of small-town life and the grudges about incidents, either real or imagined, that people tend to hold is well done in this movie. It strikes a chord with me especially because I can identify with having to leave a beautiful pink brick house in one state to live in a rather weather beaten one in a rather hostile environment in Texas. My experience came complete with a bullying female schoolmate like Big Dolores....But in the confrontation scene between Birdie and Dot, we get a hint of what might one day happen between Bernice and Dolores ....  Gena Rowlands and Harry Connick Jr.portray characters with a lot of warmth as they help Birdie and her daughter deal with having to rebuild their lives. The potrayal of Birdie's wayward and weak-willed husband is admirable,too.  People can relate to this film at different levels. For many, it could serve as a warning against early marriages and the need to focus on higher education before marriage, which could have afforded Birdie a better job once she had to find one for herself, and considering how Birdie had to face those she had once tormented after being humiliated on national television, we see how the following adage still rings true:""Be nice to people you meet on your way up because you may have to deal with them again on your way down.""",995328000,4,1426,4.72289156626506

How are little girls supposed to act, when their father is gone,  and their whole world has been suddenly changed?  The evolution of Justin  and Birdee's relationship is also touching.  She doesn't automatically fall  into his arms, it takes time, and alot of work on his part.  He is a man  who is willing to wait for her, and he understands that she still has alot  of feelings for her husband, that she must explore.

This film deals with dilemmas which we each have or  will, at some time, face in our lives.  The situations will not necessarily  be the same but have loss and betrayal in common with the occurrences in  the film.  Sandra Bullocks's portrayal of Birdee was impeccable.  I  especially liked the fact that she surrounded herself with  ""things"" that she associated with the people that she had lost.  She kept Bill's shirt that she had found before leaving the house.  It,  evidently, still had his scent on it.  She slept in it at her mother's.  She wore her father's jacket the day that she walked through the rain to  the school.  She carried his lunch pail as a purse.  After her mother's  death, she wroe the mother's dress for the funeral.  These are things that  I have found myself doing after a loss.  It gave a ""realness"" to  that character that she would not have had otherwise.  I had seen Harry  Connick Jr. in other things, but he was outstanding in this movie.  I have,  since, gone back to have a second look at his other performances.  He is,  very quickly, becoming one of my very favorite singers and actors!  Both of  the children in the film were darling.  I enjoyed Mae Whitman's efforts at  driving ""Justin"" away from her mother!  The skunk story is  classic.  Gena Rowlands was outstanding as the mother.  She was always  there for her family/daughter altho' she did not always ""say"" or  ""do"" the right thing.  She tried to ""do well"" by them.
