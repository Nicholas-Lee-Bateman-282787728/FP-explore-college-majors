8623353,4,B00GHP8T6O,"This movie set is distributed by echo bridge home entertainment. They released this set just weeks before they lost the rights to the miramax catalog. I've only watched 5 of the movies on this set so far and they've been good ones. The ones in particular are the 2 prophecy movies, the 2 Dracula movies and Halloween resurrection. (Just started getting into this genre and most call resurrection the worst of the series but don't know that as I just started here.) This set comes in a flimsy slip cover case with 2 separate dvd cases with 5 movies each. Don't expect great quality picture on this set. Or any subtitles. Yep. No subtitles. This is not a problem for me as I normally watch DVD's on my laptop, and usually don't care about the quality on any dvd set watching it on a pc. I'm going to check out the other movies on this set within the next week or two and will update this review when I'm done. This set is a great gift for anybody looking into horror movies and wish to start collecting them, and don't really care about the quality or subtitles. I hope this review helped you decide whether or not to consider buying this set or not. Thanks for reading!",1446336000,,1168,4.387096774193548
