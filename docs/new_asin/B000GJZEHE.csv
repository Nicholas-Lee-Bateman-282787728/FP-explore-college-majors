8133263,4,B000GJZEHE,"This 1994 VHS tape (it does not appear to be available on DVD) begins with a short animated sequence about people's body images, how the body is a microcosm of the entire universe, and that the energy flowing through the universe in never-ending streams is the same as that which flows through our body. This is followed by a brief introduction by the teacher, Stephen Cope, in which he reminds us to synchronize the physical movements with deep breathing and focusing attention on bodily sensations. Cope is the author of several books about yoga, which I have not yet read.

The set is like a small clearing in a forest, with trees and rocks. Piano music plays quietly in the background. The sequence of standing postures includes abdominal breathing with the hands on the stomach, inhaling the arms overhead and exhaling them down, tightening all muscles of the body and face and then releasing them, neck stretches, forward bend (done in a vertebra by vertebra ""rag doll"" manner), half moon, hip rotations, standing angle (a forward bend with legs widely spread), lunge and triangle.

Next the ""rag doll"" is repeated, going into the downward and then upward facing dog, child's pose, bridge, bringing the knees to chest for a circular massage of the lower back, spinal rolling, half spinal twist, seated forward bend, and bound angle pose (aka butterfly or cobbler's pose), followed by relaxing in savasana. Cope returns in a brief afterword to remind us to take this relaxation into our daily activities.

I enjoyed this short (about 30 minutes) sequence of asanas, and thought that it provided a good balance of the different types of yogic postures, was not too difficult to do, and was relaxing. It is not vinyasa power yoga, but more of a slow internal practice. The emphasis on paying attention to the breath and experience of bodily sensations reminded me of qigong (my primary practice) in some ways.",1435017600,,1912,4.895061728395062
