3554237,5,B001EHDSS4,"Old School Nickelodeon fans have been waiting years for Rocko's Modern Life to be released on DVD. I think the first two DVD volumes, that Amazon has recently posted, will sell like hotcakes.  Hopefully, there will are plans to release season sets Rocko's Modern Life on DVD in 2009 or for the holidays of 2008! Please make plans for Rocko on DVD! Many people want to see their childhood memories!",1219449600,4,397,4.671428571428572
3554238,5,B001EHDSS4,"title says it all, Rocko's Modern Life was TOP notch back in the day when Nickelodeon, and Cartoon network, were both literally in their prime. Ever since those days they have really gone down hill sadly. One would say to me, ""Oh, that's just because you've gotten older, that's all..."" or ""you aged out of it, you're more mature now and see things for what they really are...""

okay so the SECOND one might be a little more towards the truth but still, ""Ned's Declassified!?"" ""My Gym Partner's a Monkey!?"" I mean what the heck is that crap!? ""i-Carly"" and that stoooopid show with Britney Spear's little clone!? ""Fairly Odd Parents!?""&nbsp;

anyways, this is a great purchase, it's a classic in my book!",1226793600,,704,4.715447154471545
3554239,3,B001EHDSS4,"Wow, what a great idea for a Rocko's Modern Life episode!

Rocko's been waiting a decade for his favorite cartoon show from his childhood to finally come out on DVD, and then one day he sees it for sale only to find out that it's expensive, contains no extras, and is created using a new ""burn on demand"" process so he can't even really envision what exactly he's going to get.  Should he buy it or not?

Well, I don't know, but this was a classic Homer Simpson ""WoooHOOO....D'oh"" moment for me when I saw one of the great satirical cartoons of our time finally out, and then I noticed how it would be created and delivered.

I really don't know what to do here, but I know I've seen every episode of this series.  It's a classic, and I suppose I'm happy it's out there at all.",1226275200,,777,4.222972972972973
3554240,4,B001EHDSS4,"The  burn on demand discs work fine. No features of any kind, static menus. Episodes themselves look and sound as good as can be. This, along with Volume 1, actually completes the first season of the show on DVD.",1225324800,2,212,4.435897435897436
3554241,5,B001EHDSS4,"Yet again, Amazon has made me happier than ever before. This DVD is great. Awesome quality, nice boxart, and great episodes! I am glad to see more of Filburt in this DVD because volume one didn't have much of him. Thank you so much amazon! By the way, the best of volume 1 and 2 make the complete first season. Hopefully, Amazon will make best of volume 3 and 4, which will be season 2, best of volume 5 and 6 which will be season 3, and best of volume 7 and 8 which will be season 4. Thanks you Amazon!",1223596800,,503,3.99009900990099
3554242,5,B001EHDSS4,"With the deal struck between Nickelodeon and Amazon, we finnaly have various titles being released that I thought we would never see. Thank you Amazon! Now if only you could strike the same deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment and get titles like X-Men, Spiderman, MMPR, and Digimon in Region 1 boxsets. I would gladly pay my hard earned money for titles like that.",1222819200,,369,4.78125
3554243,5,B001EHDSS4,"Although the title calls this set a 'best of', it is actually all from the first season, as with volume 1. Together they have the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!",1221350400,3,154,4.535714285714286
3554244,5,B001EHDSS4,"""Garbage day is a very dangerous day."" ""That was a hoot!"" ""I'm nauseous, I'm nauseous, I'm nauseous."" ""Oh boy."" ""Oh fishsticks."" ""I hate my life."" ""Pineapples!""

These are all phrases that we '90s kids grew up on. Thanks to these DVDs, we can say them again. Thank you, amazon and Nickelodeon for remembering Rocko, Spunky, Heffer, Filburt, Ed & Bev Bighead, and the rest of the citizens of O-Town!",1219968000,7,398,4.768115942028985
3554245,4,B001EHDSS4,I kept searching and searching for dvd releases of Rocko's modern life and finally! They are making them! I and definitely getting them.,1219708800,2,136,4.956521739130435
3554246,5,B001EHDSS4,"I made the mistake of purchasing ""The Best of Rocko's Modern Life Volume 2 (2 Disc set)"" a few years ago from Amazon and at the time thought it was great but now I wish I would've waited and saved some money... The whole first season cost less than these 14 episodes, so save some money and buy the first season&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocko-s-Modern-Life-Season-1/dp/B004RBC5IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocko's Modern Life-Season 1</a>

3554247,1,B001EHDSS4,"There is no doubt that ""Rocko's Modern Life"" was one of Nick's supremely funny shows.  Having it on DVD would be wonderful.

""Would be"", not ""is"".  Consider this.  You are being asked to pay $27 each for 2 2-disc sets containing (are you ready for this?) an hour and 10 minutes each.  That's a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes, which could easily fit on a single disc with room to spare.  Is this a super rip-off or what?  Let me know when the price drops to $3 and I'll think about it.",1219536000,3,485,4.095744680851064
8298128,4,B001EHDSS4,"Wish that Nickelodeon just had a full set of Rocko and other old shows on DVD, I don't know why they are resisting such an idea.  No problems with the DVD and it was a nice memory but I can't imagine that these are the best episodes of Rocko and I'd love to see a full season/full show set come out.",1293408000,,299,3.901639344262295
8298129,4,B001EHDSS4,"Both of my DVD players are from the late 90s or early 2000s and play the DVDs without any problems. Don't expect any special features, though.

If these DVDs are the censored versions, then a lot of stuff got past the censors. The DVDs and box are labeled ""Unrated"". The show is not something one would want to show little kids or those with extreme sensitivities. Fans of the show or shows like it should enjoy this set, if it works on their DVD players.",1278806400,,455,4.352941176470588
8298130,5,B001EHDSS4,"I bought this for my mom who (I think) likes Rocko more than anyone on the planet.  All in all, Rocko is just great.  I will be getting Volume 3 soon.",1264377600,,150,3.806451612903226
8298131,5,B001EHDSS4,"Great quality, great episodes, and AWESOME show!!! WARNING!!! Watch for lots of sexual innuedos!!!! Keep it up Amazon!! And curses to you Nickelodeon, for not giving the fans what they want! Thanks Amazon and Joe Murray!! 5/5",1262131200,,225,5.108108108108108
8298132,5,B001EHDSS4,"I'm very happy Rocko is now on DVD, even if it is not a normal release. I had no problem playing the DVDs in any of my players. The menu is simple and basic, has a play all option. If you love Rocko's modern life... this sells it self. I didn't see specific problem with picture quality etc. I hope they put Rocko's Modern Christmas on DVD as well!",1259539200,,348,4.057971014492754
8298133,5,B001EHDSS4,"I am so glad that Nickelodeon has made these episodes available--at last!  I have really missed this show!  I really like the characters and how much personality they have and how funny the show is.  The humor is so off the wall and yet still, on the whole, in very ood taste.  It is much funnier than most of the current TV shows.  The characters and situations seem to be based on real life but taken to the extreme of funniness and imagination.  Wow!  I hope that Nickelodeon will release even more Rocko!  Great show!",1253145600,,521,4.410526315789474
8298134,2,B001EHDSS4,"Well it's nice to finally see this great show available in some form. But as explained in the first review these are not real full on sets, there are no extras, there the ""cut"" versions =( I've already recorded and edited every episode off Nick for my own enjoyment so I doubt I'll be spending the $ for pretty much the same thing, another point made by someone commenting on Vol. 1 is that these are not DVD as you would get in the store, these are DVD-R witch don't always play on ever home DVD player ! I've run into this problem before on Amazon it's one of the few complaints I have about buying here. They need to be clear about such things when available. Other than that If you don't have any Rocko around =( pick one of these up, you never know when the day will come that a dose of Heffer and the gang could turn that frown upside down =) Viva La Rocko  PS: there is one episode I haven't seen though ""Jet Stream"" But you can see it on IMDB or search YouTube.",1239926400,,969,4.1
8298135,1,B001EHDSS4,"What a GREAT show but what crappy DVD's. How dare they edit the original show! Then, on top of that, I had to make my own DVD's to get them to work right on my DVD players. I wish I had the discipline to send them back because of how horrible the media was but I was so starved for a good quality recording of Rocko. For me anything was better than nothing. The media and censorship made this very close to nothing; this is why it gets a 1 star from me. (Show rates a 5 star rating)",1238630400,5,482,3.878787878787879
8298136,5,B001EHDSS4,"We had ordered Rocko's Modern Life as a Christmas gift.  When our son opened it, he found the disk loose in the container and severely scratched.  We know these things happen, but we are giving a 5-star rating on this one because a replacement was sent to us very promptly, in perfect condition, and with no complications.  By the time our son finished enjoying Volume 1, you had Volume 2 in his hands.  Thank you so much.",1235952000,,422,4.441558441558442
8298137,1,B001EHDSS4,"I was very, very excited to see this DVD. However, when I tried to play it in my DVD player it would not let me play the episodes. It does work on the DVD player on  my computer, though.",1230422400,2,186,3.769230769230769
