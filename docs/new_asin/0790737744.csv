105741,5,0790737744,"It seems ironic that the film performance that ranks as one ofEastwood's best and most substantial to date also examines very deeplyhis most popular yet most one-dimensional character of Harry Callahan. Actually the differences between Wes in this film and dirty Harry are abounding, in both general and specific terms.  For instance, instead of firing rounds of bullets needlessly and dangerously three minutes into a movie and grunting inane dialogue like ""Make my day"", the Eastwood of TIGHTROPE doesn't shoot any bullets except two, one hour and 10 minutes into the movie; and then on a deserted street.  He has two daughters from a divorce and has moments of sensitivity and warm humor.  Generally the big difference is that Wes is a more personable and likeable guy that asks, not tells what he wants. Callahan on the other hand pushes people around in a very unrealistic way to obtain a means to an end.  But while these differences exist there are similarities.  Both characters feed off situations where outward masculinity seem to be more important than inward feeling. The movie examines this in the similarities between Wes and the killer.  You get the feeling at one time, with Eastwood's performance that he is the killer himself.  But masculinity means many different things to many different people.  To some (this reviewer included), because that image is only outward, it is gratifying to know that Wes is a real person on the inside, one of several differences between Harry Callahan or the killer in this movie.  And that is where the REAL similarity evolves.  Not between Wes and the killer, but between Harry Callahan and the killer.  Think about it for a second.  Both characters resort to violence to get their way.  Both characters have souls with the shallowness of a desert mirage.  And both characters believe talking is a ""weak"" means of communication. And that superficial waste material seems to rub off on audiences too. TIGHTROPE seems to be looking at them, too, with a careful and critical eye.  It seems to be saying: don't emulate dirty Harry Callahan too much or you will start using red ribbons to strangle women.  Cinematically, the film doesn't waste a second.  Like the dirty Harry films it crams as much into a single frame of celluoid as it can.  The pacing is brutally fast.  But, the beauty of THIS film is part of what it crams into those frames: inward character information. Which brings us back to Eastwood's performance.  So humanly realistic and natural is Clint's work that you temporarily forget you are watching one of the film industries all time biggest box-office draws. You, in fact, loose yourself in the character and his dilemma. Equally good is Geneveive Bujold as the rape case controller who works with and later falls in love with Clint.  There is true chemistry between the two of them.  They are backed with an excellent supporting cast, an atmospheric music score and, as I said before, a caring and substantial script and directorial job by Richard Tuggle.  Co-producer Eastwood and other stars should examine their screen persona more often if the result would be this fulfilling.  If you are of age, see this movie.",952128000,,3187,4.914018691588785

105804,5,0790737744,I had seen Tightrope a couple times before and while I pretty much forgot everything I remember thinking it was just OK. Wow was I wrong. Apparently third time's a charm because I thoroughly loved it. Maybe that has to do with my experience with one of my favorite film genres since the last time I saw it which is film noir but I was shocked that I didn't love it the first time I saw it. I really admire Eastwood for taking a risk and playing a character completely against type who's basically a questionable film noir detective. The cinematography and score is terrific as well. Its also a sexually dark film which may turn off some viewers and Eastwood isn't a Dirty Harry/Western type character either. I think its a top notch thriller.,1473033600,2,742,4.503703703703704

105846,5,0790737744,"At 114 minutes, I had hoped that this would be a complete version of the original film, but, it wasn't. For the benefit of those who never saw the complete film, what's missing are key plot elements starting with the opening scene where Block is assigned to investigate the murder of a prostitute because he knew her; she had been a witness in one of his cases. Another occurs at a crime scene where Block only begins to suspect that he's being set up and, startled to discover that this victim is a girl that he interviewed and had sex with, tells what he thinks to be a white lie, claiming that he hadn't gotten around to her yet when asked if this wasn't one of the girls he had already interviewed. Thus it is that, when it's discovered he hadn't volunteered knowing yet another of the victims and is forced to deny knowing any of the rest, Block is forced to walk the principle tightrope the title refers to; trying to keep his personal life together and stay on the job long enough to solve the case else he's sure to be convicted by the next officer assigned. There's something else missing, but, space won't permit.",1439078400,9,1123,4.429951690821256

105849,4,0790737744,"Richard Tuggle's riveting suspense thriller about a New Orleans homicide police detective named Wes Block, played by Clint Eastwood, in a remarkable performance, who goes off the sexual deep end when his wife leaves him, as he explores the darker side of his sexuality, at the same time a sadistic serial killer is terrorizing the city with a string of brutal sex murders. Eastwood finds he has much in common with the psychotic he is pursuing, two men on opposing sides of the law with the same taste in sleaze sex. Expert supporting performances from Genevieve Bujold, Dan Hedaya, Jenny Beck, and Alison Eastwood. A well-crafted, exciting thriller that is brilliantly written and directed by Eastwood's protegee Richard Tuggle. Highly Recommended.",1438041600,,749,5.198347107438017

105863,4,0790737744,"A very dark film with some good and bad points, 'Tightrope' comes across as yet another variation on the 'Dirty Harry' character.  This time we really dwell in the sleazy parts of the character, although Clint does try and redeem himself in the movie.  The best parts of the movie are the acting, both Clint (who's never been better) and Genevieve Bujold (who is old enough to play this part effectively), the cinematography (which is pitch black) and the tone, which is grim and dirty and almost noir.  The worse parts of the movie is the plot, especially the ending (more than contrived) and the direction (which was disputed and reportedly taken over by Clint).
Yet despite the shortcoming of the film - and they are there, believe me! - I still like the film for being yet another example of Clint subverting the audience's expectation.  Throughout the 1970's and 1980's (before he gained Hollywood Legend status) an Eastwood produced movie almost always had a way of giving the audience what it wanted while still undermining the genre expectations of the form.  Here you have a macho detective who finds himself unable to be a parent or even a romantic partner and must redeem himself, both emotionally and eventually physically.  Sure, it is a cheap movie shot on location in New Orleans, but that is what gave Clint the freedom to explore the character.  And that is why I like the picture; it is emotion over gloss, substance over action.  Plus it has perhaps the best romance in a Clint movie ever, or at least a partner who appears to be his equal.",1436400000,2,1559,4.684981684981685

105870,4,0790737744,Clint said that thru this film he would be playing a flawed character and that he may lose a few of his fans with this dark thriller but I think this film signaled a change in his films where he would explore the dark side of masculinity--a subject he's well known for now.  I only gave this 4 stars because the middle sagged a little but picks up again when he realizes that the killer has invaded his home---and the scene follows next is an excellent example of screen acting by Clint.  He's definitely not Dirty Harry but a flawed cop who must confront his dark side before he can win.  Definitely recommended.,1427846400,,613,4.407079646017699

one of these insults is TIGHTROPE a classic Eastwood film from the early 80's
get's it's first ever blu-ray Debut by Warner bros
but tragically very sadly no new special features
the old dvd release from over 8 years ago didn't get any respect either with special features
so i would've thought this film would get new special features on blu-ray at least
but tragically no, it's like going to funeral as far as i'm concerned
like many fans i did expect some new extras for this blu-ray
so when i found out no new special features, i thought how pointless is this this blu-ray is not worth buying

maybe a new retrospective featurette with Clint eastwood & his Co-star Genevieve Bujold
and Director Richard Tuggle
or maybe a new Audio commentary by Director could easily been added to this new blu-ray
tragically WB did not bother
WB just quickly transferred the dvd to blu-ray and maybe did enhance the picture quality with a new blu-ray transfer
but that's it.
a Pointless blu-ray release i think waste of money
as a fan i am Disgusted with Warner bros they made no effort at all for this film
the film deserves 4-5stars
this blu-ray is only worth 1 star if that a waste of money

105948,4,0790737744,"""Lured by the promise of kinky sex, two men prowl the French Quarter. One is a cop. The other is a killer. Clint Eastwood is Wes Block, a lawman walking a Tightrope separating him from the man he strives to be and the man he fears he is. When investigating brutal sex murders, he uncovers a link between himself and the suspect.

To the killer, the only good hooker is a dead one - especially if she's been with Block. Soon no woman who knows Block is safe, including those dearest to him (Genevieve Bujold and Alison Eastwood).

Since the crime is the mutilation and murder of young women arising out of sexual sadism, this involves many scenes of Eastwood engaging in the underworld of violent sex, and many scenes shot in the dark. The actual solving of the crime is pretty lame, as Eastwood, ostensibly working on the police force, actually seems to spend most of his time doing his own thing, which is wandering from one den of iniquity to the next. This is the first film of Eastwood's turning in which he plays characters that are non-heroic and even repulsive.

105971,5,0790737744,"Clint Eastwood's 1984 ""Tightrope"" is a daring step away from his more familiar ""Harry Callahan"" tough cop movie personna.  Wes Block is a nuanced role for Eastwood, a middle-aged New Orleans cop, unhappily divorced and raising two young daughters on his own.  Just to make it interesting, Block has a drinking problem, an unhealthy interest in kinky sex, a serial murderer of prostitutes loose in the French Quarter, and a pushy female from a rape crisis center demanding action.

Block works the case, finding himself tempted by the prostitutes he interviews, and discovering too many of them mysteriously dead in his wake, suggesting the killer is taunting Block.  Wes and the rape counselor (Geneviere Bujold) find they have something in common, just as the serial killer begins to close in on Wes and his family...

""Tightrope"" makes full use of its New Orleans venue, including lots of dark scenes in the French Quarter and along the Mississippi, backed by a nicely arranged jazz movie score.  Eastwood gets to interact with real-life daughter Allison, and work out an interesting relationship with the rape counselor.  The murder mystery itself is a little underdeveloped; the muderer is pretty much a mystery to the audience as well as to the cast until the final scenes.

105983,4,0790737744,"Serial killer movies really came into their own with 1991's ""Silence of the Lambs."" The psychological and forensic aspects became more sophisticated in the real world and these elements began working their way into movie plots. This lead to the making of some really decent genre pieces such as ""Se7en,"" ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""The Bone Collector."" ""Tightrope"" is a good movie that hasn't quite withstood the test of time.

Here's the scoop. Clint Eastwood plays a New Orleans police detective and divorced father of two young girls. He's investigating the deaths of some local girls. The problem is that the killer seems to possess some of the same demons as Clint. Meanwhile he's beginning a romance with Genevieve Bujold, a very progressive thinking woman.

This is a very good movie. Eastwood has his usual presence and flair for picking a really good jazz musical score. Writer/director Richard Tuggle, who penned Eastwood's previous ""Escape From Alcatraz"", does a solid job on the directing side. They do a decent job with the detective work including the forensic details. Somehow, though, I found it a bit flat and maybe a bit too obvious. I felt as though they kept pointing a finger as to where I was supposed to look and what I was supposed to see. I liked the Bujold character. She's got a great face and they gave her a couple of closeups that took my breath away. Her ""modern, liberated"" character is a good juxtaposition to Eastwood's character who always needs to exercise control over his women. You hope he will come around. Dan Hedaya, the penultimate character actor, is on hand to lend resonance to the proceedings.

This is a good, solid effort. It's only problem is that this genre of film has gotten better since this was made. It's probably more three and a half stars as opposed to the four I gave it but it's still a good watch.",1320019200,,1853,4.730650154798762

105988,5,0790737744,"With an iconic image that encompassed the Man With No Name persona in the spaghetti westerns he did for Sergio Leone in the 1960s, and his steely performances as Dirty Harry Callahan in five movies, it is sometimes a bit too easy to overlook how complex a figure Clint Eastwood really has shown himself to be over time, both in front of and behind the camera.  The tough-guy persona has made him a hero of the political Right in America, even though he himself is more of a commonsense conservative, and subsequently it has tended to obscure equally valid and more humanistic roles such as the one he essayed in his 1976 western classic THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES.  But throughout his career, he has done roles that a lot of actors would not touch with a ten-foot pole.  One such role could be found in the highly underrated 1984 suspense thriller TIGHTROPE, his first venture into the genre since his own 1971 directorial debut in PLAY MISTY FOR ME.

Set in New Orleans, TIGHTROPE puts Eastwood into another cop role, but this one is the more complex role of Wes Block, a New Orleans cop investigating a series of killings involving call girls in the seediest parts of the city's famous French Quarter.  As it happens, he has an unavoidable predilection for such women of the night, even though he is also a family man for his two children.  The methods the killer uses against these women is roughly the same, and pretty brutal; and what makes things even more disturbing, as time goes on, is the fact that, as more call girls fall victim, they all share a link with him in that Eastwood is always the last one to have seen them alive.  While continuing his investigation of the crimes, he becomes chummy with a steely rape counselor (Bujold); and they discuss the sexual proclivities of this serial killer.  It isn't long, however, before the killer gets awfully close to Eastwood, and suspicion actually falls on Eastwood himself.  When his own daughter (Allison Eastwood) is almost raped and killed during a break-in at Eastwood's house, it is just a short step before his investigation turns into a revenge manhunt.  And when he finally knows who he's looking for, he also realizes why the suspicion for the crimes has fallen on him.

Having just come off doing his fourth turn as Dirty Harry in 1983's SUDDEN IMPACT (which he also directed), Eastwood teamed up with first-time director Tuggle, who had also scripted the 1979 prison drama ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ, which he starred in under his mentor Don Siegel's direction.  Much like PLAY MISTY FOR ME, and, perhaps on an even greater level, HIGH PLAINS DRFITER and the hugely underrated 1971 Southern Gothic offering THE BEGUILED, the character of Wes Block in TIGHTROPE allowed Eastwood to explore his darker and more vulnerable side, this while also venturing into the seedier areas of sex and violence that used to be starkly defined by those on the Right, both in Hollywood and in America in general during the age of Reagan.  There are the unavoidable parallels to Hitchcock's classic films, notably PSYCHO, ROPE, and FRENZY, but Tuggle isn't so brash as to think of himself as another Hitchcock (or even Brian DePalma).  Instead, he concentrates on depicting the dark and seedy nature of the New Orleans French Quarter and how Eastwood interacts with it, aided as he is by the fine camerawork of veteran Eastwood cinematographer Bruce Surtees, and composer Lennie Niehaus, who had helped orchestrate previous film scores for the likes of Lalo Schifrin and Jerry Fielding, making a solid film scoring debut here with New Orleans jazz and blues motifs.

Even more significantly, Eastwood manages to mix it up well with Bujold, whose realistic character in TIGHTROPE has close parallels with her role in Michael Crichton's 1978 medical thriller COMA.  The film's very title, contained in a remark made by one of Eastwood's female colleagues that we often ""walk a tightrope"" between good and evil, is letter perfect for the plot on hand; and while the subject matter may be distasteful at times, and perhaps a disappointment for Eastwood's more macho fan base fringe, the end result in TIGHTROPE is one of his best and most underrated films, hugely atmospheric, suspenseful, and downright frightening in ways that so many ultra-violent slasher horror films of the 1980s and beyond never were and never could be.",1296432000,,4365,4.846774193548387

The woman activist who is teaching self defense to other women. The divorced father who is taking care of two girls. The victims chosen among the female haphazard or not of the main cop who arrested him a long time ago, in order to get even with him, to get his revenge. The Mardi Gras turned into crime peddling. The three cops keeping one woman under surveillance and protection killed one after the other and the woman assaulted. Etc. So what makes this film special? The cool character of the inspector, slow and fast at the same time, Pondering and following his instinct at some other time. Professional and yet yielding to prostitutes a little too easily and too often, and forgetting his ties on the place of intercourse. Having a problem explaining his younger daughter what a hard-on is. And the word is used twice in the film. There is also the perfect well built suspense founded and built on the shoes and the color of the shoelaces of the criminal. The absolute ruthlessness of this killer who enjoys raping his victims before they die by strangulation and then even eating a cookie and having a cup of coffee. That nonchalance is rarely expected nor found in a serial killer, though he may become so used to his deeds that follow a strict scenario that he may become easy-going about it. That's why the film is perfectly entertaining and Bourbon street on Mardi Gras is so colorful and fascinating. We would like every day to be a Mardi Gras, even if that is the paradise of murderers who can disguise the way they want and be absolutely unseen, invisible. And it all holds with a red silk ribbon. Marvelous detail that makes the film nearly sentimental, like the red badge of courage turned perverse and sociopathic.

106007,5,0790737744,"I recently ""discovered"" the genius of Clint Eastwood ... and I have a lot of catching up to do. After seeing this film, I have a deeper appreciation for this performer's tremendous range.

Of the film itself, it is phenomenally gripping and complex. I was stunned at the ""grey area"" this work explores. Contemporary mainstream film often writes ""black and white"" characters: this character is ""good,"" that one ""bad."" So tedious is this trend, that many critical viewers have abandoned ""Hollywood"" films entirely. Nonetheless, ""Tightrope"" illustrates that Hollywood once created deep, rich characters. Tuggle's work toys with a seeming contradiction: that Eastwood's character is a loving single-father to two young, sensitive girls AND that he has shockingly misogynistic impulses. The audience views Eastwood's character, Captain Block, indulge his sexual aggression with prostitutes (which is perhaps a result of his bitter divorce or perhaps a genuine aspect of his personality) and then return home to gently tuck his children into bed. This is jarring! Moreover, that Captain Block's love-interest is a powerful, rape-defense instructor only complicates his very human character. Eastwood enacts this multi-faceted role with absolute precision.

The casting is remarkable!! That Tuggle cast an ""average"" (read: unconventionally attractive) actress to play Eastwood's love-interest is ingenious. Genevive Bujold plays the aforementioned defense-expert. As Beryl Thibodeaux, Bujold is the perfect counterpart to Eastwood. While intrigued by Captain Block, Thibodeaux quickly detects his misogynist tendencies and indicates that she will not be another conquest, but an equal. For instance, while on their first lunch date, Block tells Thibodeaux, ""[I wonder] what it would be like to lick the sweat off your body."" Her reaction is perfect: she is not angry, she is not aroused, she merely states that he could attempt a bit more subtlety ... that he could express a sentiment to her that he does not express to every woman he meets. It is both clever and progressive.

When watching this film, I wonder where these complicated works are today. I think Hollywood should take a lesson from Tuggle's work and show its audience characters who are both good parents and professionals with deep ""flaws"" (and the manner in which Block comes to terms with his sadistic side is quite compelling ... but no spoilers here!!) Block's humanity is excellently portrayed ... and I am continuing my exploration of Eastwood films hoping to find more of this!

Watch this film if you are interested in 1980's Hollywood, Eastwood's films, crime dramas, or the use of ""strong women"" in male-dominated films.",1177113600,5,2690,5.397619047619048
106008,5,0790737744,"Perverse, voyeuristic and nightmarish are not words commonly associated with Clint Eastwood's oeuvre, but in 1984 Richard Tuggle on the strength of his story was given the opportunity by Eastwood to direct his first film. The result is a seedy stroll through the backstreets and whorehouses of New Orleans. The success of the film relies on Eastwood's willingness to manipulate and subvert his iconic screen image. Since the warm comic capers of ""Every Which Way But Loose"" Eastwood had shown a propensity to experiment with his characters. This reaches something of an apex in the trouble and haunted homicide detective Wes Block. Block finds himself empathising a little too much with the serial killer who is plaguing the warm New Orleans nights. Adding to Block's complexity is a turbulent family life in which he is the single parent of two young children and a blossoming romance. The film really gets to grips with psychology of the serial killer as Block attempts to get inside his mind, the revelation that Block finds himself enjoying certain perverse delights creates a wonderful tension in the film that implicates Block as a possible suspect. Another major success of the film is the location, New Orleans beats not with life, but with death as the Mardi Gras takes a back seat and Tuggle explores the dark and seamy nightlife of this soulful and mysterious town. Ultimately this film is the real Dirty Harry, with the emphasis on Dirty. ""Tightrope"" is to the Eastwood detective image/film what ""Unforgiven"" was to his western image, a deconstruction of myths and iconic status.

This is a very dark (literally) film with a big film-noir look and feel. Neo-noir, I guess, is what they call post-1950 gritty crime films like these.

Eastwood's character in ""Tightrope"" is a complex one. On one hand, he's a wonderfully loving father of two sweet girls (one played by his actual daughter, and played well), and yet he is a weak man when it comes to prostitutes. But, whatever side he shows - light or dark - he's interesting, as always. So is the female star of this movie, Genevieve Bujold, a woman with a very intriguing face and just a trace of her French accent. Dan Heyada contributes strongly in a low- key performance.

106022,5,0790737744,"I saw this film ages ago, and recently viewed it again.  It's even better than I remembered, and it's one of Eastwood's best films.  As other have noted, it's a really dark film (even today).  If it had been made today, it would probably get branded with a NC-17 rating because of its realistic depiction of the sleazy side of New Orleans.  Eastwood is a cop chasing a serial killer who has a predeliction for rough, sleazy sex like Eastwood's character does.  The sex scenes are uncomfortable to watch, they are not titillating at all.  The violence in the film is also pretty brutal.  It's not glamorized at all.  It's quite savage.  Eastwood gives one of his better performances here, Dan Hedaya gives a good performance, and Genevieue Bujold is excellent as Clint's love interest.  Even Allison Eastwood, his real life daughter who plays his daughter here, is good.  Today, this film would probably be filmed as a joke, with all the kinky sex done in a ""fun"" way, making it light and funny.  Eastwood doesn't do this.  It's shot on location in New Orleans, and it takes place a lot at night, adding to the brooding and intensity of it. Even day scenes seem dark here.  This is a really creepy film, one of Eastwood's darkest films.

Even though Richard Tuggle is credited with directing, he didn't.  He started as director, but he was going too slow for Clint's tastes, so Clint relieved Tuggle and took over the directing himself.  Union rules in the DGA prevented Clint getting credit for directing (because Clint did the same thing with Philip Kaufman on The Outlaw Josey Wales), but for all intensive purposes, Clint directed this film.

Clint gives a flat out amazing performance as a police officer investigating the murder of prostitutes in red light new orleans while also exploring his own disturbing appetites for kinky sex.

The film is deceptive. It starts out as what seems to be a typical cop thriller but quickly evolves into something much deeper and multilayered. Clint shows an emotional complexity all the more extraordinary because of its subtlety. It should have easily been his first acting oscar nod.

Also worth noting is that this is one of the best films ever filmed in New Orleans. It excellently captures the unique flavor and ambience of the city. (something all the more precious in this post katrina era)

Block is pursuing a serial killer who is murdering prostitutes in the seedy underside of New Orleans.  Block finds himself strangely drawn into this underworld and walking the ""tightrope"" between right and wrong, good and evil, as he balances his search for the killer.  Meanwhile, his behavior eerily shadows the killer's deviant pursuits quite often leaving the viewer gasping in shock.

In the role of a rape counselor is Genevieve Bujold, as Beryl Thibodeaux.  An excellent counterbalance to Block, she plays on the tightrope, too.  We watch as his tendency towards the lurid develops, yet her job is one of comforter and defender of those who are victems of violence and also to prevent violence against women.  Their attraction creates an interesting tension during the film.

Another interesting feature of ""Tightrope"" is how it shows the difficulty Wes Block faces raising two daughters as a single father, especially given the nature of his job.  Eastwood's real-life daughter, Alison, plays one of the daughters in this film.  Without giving away too much of the plot, I should say that mentally and physically there is some threat to the family.

Overall, I would say that this film is one of Eastwood's best efforts, although it has been somewhat overlooked.  For true Eastwood fans, I feel it is truly worth watching.  Highest ratings.",1116374400,30,1519,5.093117408906883

Great story of Clint as a detective hot on the trail of a killer who may be hot on Clint's trail. Some great one-liners, plenty o' nakedness, action, and cute kids. This movie actually makes you feel dirty, but in a good way. I say rent it, buy it, put it under your pillow, drop it off on your co-workers desk and tell them that a good time awaits  them. Hopefuly you won't get fired.

106026,5,0790737744,"To me, this film is even more impressive today than it was when I first saw it. Frankly, when seeing it 20 years ago, I was thrown off-balance by the character whom Eastwood plays, Wes Block, a police detective in New Orleans. He pursues a serial killer of prostitutes, a psychopath with whom he seems to share similar psycho-sexual preoccupations. Presumably this was a risky part for Eastwood to take on. Under skillful but deferential direction by Richard Tuggle, he explores with great skill certain depraved tendencies within himself which were much more shocking in 1984 than they seem to be, regrettably, two decades later. Block's personal situation is complicated even more by the fact that he a single parent, raising two daughters. It is also important to remember that his personal conduct creates the risk of compromising his professional integrity as a law enforcement officer. For these and other reasons, Block is a much more enigmatic character than, for example, Harry (""what you see is what you get"") Callahan.

In the role of Beryl Thibodeaux, Genevieve Bujold portrays a criminal psychologist who is attracted to Block as they work together even as she begins to sense and then contend with at least some of the demons which torment him. So much of this film occurs (both literally and symbolically) in darkness. Even a trained professional such as Thibodeaux is frustrated in her attempts to understand someone for whom she feels sincere affection. Special credit should be given to Bruce Surtees for superb cinematography which is coordinated seamlessly with the often depressing storyline. He had worked with Eastwood in previous films which include Dirty Harry (1971), Play Misty for Me (also 1971), The Outlaw Josie Wales (1976), and Pale Rider (1985). The supporting cast is excellent, notably Eastwood's own daughter Alison who plays Amanda Block in the film, and Dan Hadeya as Detective Molinari. Eventually, after the serial killer kidnaps Amanda, her distraught and enraged father pursues her to a riveting conclusion when....

Others are much better qualified than I to express this opinion but I think Wes Block is a character which begins a new transition for Eastwood the actor. Thereafter, the characters he plays tend to be of the ""sadder but wiser"" variety, much less self-assured, more fatalistic in their view of the world, skeptical and sometimes cynical, reluctant to trust anyone or anything, and are -- for me, therefore -- much more interesting. This is an especially upsetting film which has lost little (if any) of its dramatic impact. Twenty years after its initial release and probably because I have become a grandfather, there are certain situations in Tightrope which are even more upsetting now than ever before.",1078444800,66,2765,5.128603104212861
106027,4,0790737744,"After attending New Orleans' Jazz and Heritage Festival 2003, I had to watch this movie, and watch for some features not mentioned in the other excellent reviews already given this film.
First of all, there is the title song played by great New Orleans' jazz saxophonist James Rivers, whom Eastwood also chose to play on ""Bridges of Madison County"" (the secret roadside club scene) and on ""Bird"".  Rivers is an accomplished musician on sax, flute, harmonica, and bagpipes (yes!) - check him out!
Then, there is the cemetery chase scene.  This is the cemetery in which author Anne Rice played as a child, and features graves that feature in her books.  A fake mausoleum was built to hide Eastwood in the chase scene.

Such lordage can play a pitiful mortal so well. But wait, there's a serial killer out there who is getting rid of unwanted solicitation. This movie is creepy and will make anybody not want to walk alone ever again. Watch out for psychos who wear dirty tennis shoes. That's bad news. The savior cleaned up his act and saved his children from the lunatic and the train smashed right on through! An underrated movie that should be released on DVD right now. It has been shown on television numerous times, but it hasn't been available to buy on DVD. It will scare the daylights out of you and make you think about wrestling with strangers.

His after dark habits start to hit close to home when each successive prostitute he has been with turns up dead, strangled with a pretty red ribbon.  A rape crisis counselor (Genevieve Bujold) wants to get involved in the investigation, and Block's resistance to the idea wanes when he realizes he has feelings for her.

106030,3,0790737744,"This is a very interesting film.  What makes it even more interesting is that Clint Eastwood is the star.  Sure Eastwood is in familiar territory.  He plays a New Orleans cop hot on the trail of a serial killer.  What makes this movie special is it's particular contradictions in the character played by Eastwood.  On one hand he is a good single father to his his two daughters, and on the other hand he enjoys sleeping with prostitutes.  He is charming when he is around his new love interest, a played by Genevieve Bujold, but he also says sleazy things to her.  Additionally Eastwood is not the tower of tough that he normally is, instead he displays real emotion.  Unfortunatly the plot in this movie goes down the predictable road.  However, it keeps you guessing and Eastwood is fantastic.  A must see for Eastwood fans and people who like strange movies alike.",975888000,2,868,4.651315789473684
106031,4,0790737744,"Tightrope opens with the familiar credits that mark most of Clint Eastwood's films : Malpaso films presents...over an arial shot of car  crossing a bridge. What is most surprising about this film is that  writer/director Richard Tuggle uses the familiar framework of the  ""serial killer"" movie to explore themes of guilt, sadomasochism,  sexism and paranoia. Even more surprising is the fact that he explores  those qualties in his hero, not the killer.
  Eastwood stars as Wes  Block, a New Orleans cop investigating the murders of several prostitutes  who were tortured, raped and strangled. On his journey through the brothels  of the city we sense that he has been there before, not as cop, but as a  customer. Eastwood has the usual throwaway lines that have made his Harry  Callahan character so famous, as when a prostitute apporches him ""Want  some honey?"", ""I don't eat sweets"" he replies. But where  Callahan draws knowing smirks from the audience, Block only draws gasps.  Eastwood lets us know that any outward confidence he projects is merely a  mask over his guilt. This leads to an early riveting scene where he  interviews a hooker about her murdered friend ""Did she mention anybody  using handcuffs?"" he asks. ""I think it was a cop, maybe it was  you"" she jokes. The look on Eastwood's is face is one of such anguish,  that he may even suspect himself. This one of Eastwood's best and bravest  performances.
  The scenes in the brothels and over the corpses are  contrasted with surprisingly warm domestic scenes of Block the single  parent raising his two daughters. The contrast is alarming, and the  children are perhaps the only reason why he hasn't gone over the edge just  yet. There is a particularly chilling suggestion in Tightrope that Block  maybe vicariously living his fantasies through the killer.
  On a  physcological level the film is an original, where it falters is the plot.  Perhaps inorder to get the film made, Tuggle was forced to add all the well  worn cliches, such as the obligatory chase climax and the unmasking of the  killer. He also has a tendancy to hammer home his points, as in the  unnessecary dream sequence where Eastwood imagines he is the killer.
  Some could persuasively argue the film wallows in excesses of depravity. I  would disagree, an exploitation film tries to find a token story to hold  acres of naked flesh and gore. A real film is driven to these taboo places  BY its story. Tightrope is a real film. In its moody and intelligent way it  suggests an innate depravity within the mildest of men.",963360000,12,2564,4.829099307159353
7791330,3,0790737744,This is my favorite Clint Eastwood movie.  He plays a New Orleans detective who hasn't quite got over his wife leaving him and trying to raise tow daughters by himself.  A killer is killing women in the sex industry and as he gets further into his investigation he is drawn onto the same situations as the killer is.  It is a very very intense movie.  As the investigation goes on it looks like the killer may even be a former policeman.  One of the most intense scenes in any movie I have ever scene involves him hiding his two daughters in a closet as you hear gun shots.  The youngest daughter really looks terrified.  This isn't the kind of movie you want to watch everyday.  But it is always good no matter how many times you've seen it.,1522627200,,742,4.326086956521739

7791332,4,0790737744,"In Leonard Maltin's movie review it went: ""New Orleans cop (Wes Block) finds he has much in common with the sex murderer he's been pursuing."" It goes on to say it's an intriguing Eastwood vehicle done in by ""sleaziness."" Where? Even by 1984's standards this was a fairly tame film. yes, there were murders galore of young women but hardly something that America had not seen. Remember Ted Bundy the Robert DeSalvo and Charles Manson murders from the 1960's and 1970's?

Maltin gave the film Two and a Half Stars out of Four. That's translates to 62.5% out of 100. I give this Four Stars out of Five. I liked the forensic science that was shown in depth in this film. The first film I ever saw to showcase the behind the scenes forensics used to catch serial killers. I recommend this film. Although Genevieve Bujold (Fantastic In Coma) was a bit underused in this film. She heads a rape crisis center but her character was underdeveloped. I get the idea her character was raped at some point but this was (Unfortunately) never explored in detail.

I'm the 153rd person to review this film on Amazon.
