5905312,4,B00EE25ELA,"This was not a ""great"" movie, but it was lots of fun. I saw it in the theater when it was released and liked it enough to want to watch it again. Music is really good, too! Let's face it - you just can't go wrong with Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone.",1383091200,4,253,3.8846153846153846
5905313,5,B00EE25ELA,Love this movie one of my favorite I enjoy it every time I watch it I really recommend it you'll fall in love with this movie I guarantee it,1382745600,,140,3.8620689655172415
5905314,4,B00EE25ELA,I love Hindi movies and saw this one in the theater.  I knew this was one I had to own so pre-ordered it online as soon as it showed up on Amazon.  The story is so full of life and the characters are endearing.,1379635200,10,210,3.75
5905315,5,B00EE25ELA,"IMHO, many years down the road when people look back at the career of Ranbir Kapoor they will realise that this was the movie with which he finally embraced superstardom. Movies in the past did matter, but they were made to showcase the actor in him, but post YJHD, RK's movies will be known for the commercial pursuits than pure acting showcases. I mean, he may occasionally flirt with a creative pursuit however the singular goal will be about keeping the throne, which I think he has landed with YJHD( However I wish I am proven wrong).

The film is about about three friends, Bunny played by Ranbir Kapoor ( Why would one want to name their child after a rabbit?) wants to travel the world and flirt with every moving thing, Aditi ( Kalki Koechlin), a boy in a womans body who just wants to live and Avi ( Aditya Roy Kapoor) alcohol riddled and consumed with money losing ideas. These three take a road trip to Manali and meet Naina, a bumbling, introverted, bookish medical student who has never had fun according to the standards of these friends. This journey changes their lives forever, culminating in a meeting at a wedding that takes place, eight years after that road trip in Udaipur. The plot sounds similar to DDLJ, and it is in many ways, this is just a old rehash in a brand new box- the father and son relationship between Farooque Sheikh and Ranbir is touching and tender. The director Ayan Mukherjee has a flair for such scenes, does anyone remember the parental scenes in Wake up Sid? - not a dry eye in the house. YJHD is a mashup of every bollywood romance that was successful and is a satisfying journey of emotions- high and low, high fashion and gloss and very rich people falling in love- who the hell gets to marry in a palace in Udaipur? The movie begins with rambunctiousness but turns mellow in a good way towards the end- reflecting the coming of age of the four characters. High fashion, beautiful locations and good songs border the film including a item song by Madhuri Dixit whose name is Mohini (cheesy and cheap this one)

RK is perfect as flirt who does not want to settle down- so the entire film is about him learning about life through love and loss. Siddharth Roy is amazing- why does this guy not get more acting jobs- Hopefully Aashiqui 2 will change the status quo.

Deepika and Kalki are in one word just WOW- they literally steal the show in many many places. Kalki edges out Deepika eventually with her chops and thats because her role has that kind of arc.

YJHD is a name borrowed from a oldie and reflects the aspirations of the Indian youth to a certain extent with the usual roadblocks that all of us experience- dejection, rejection, first love, heartbreak, loss etc.

Karan Johar the producer infuses the film with the gloss and the leads give it the chemistry. This is a romantic film but there are enough explorations to make you think in places but that feeling is momentary as the thought is broken by another scene. At 2 hours and 40 minutes- this a long ride but an engaging one.......Definitely for the crazy in love and also for the jaded old ones....five stars 5/10/2013",1378166400,4,3134,4.539823008849558
5905316,5,B00EE25ELA,"My family have loved Bollywood musicals since 2003 when my wife and I saw Bombay Dreams in London.  They're often a throwback to a kind of entertainment Hollywood abandoned years ago.  Television has brought them back in the form of Glee and a dozen talent shows, but for a story driven musical film experience, Bollywood is where the action is.

Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is a great example.  Don't expect plot twists, just enjoy the ride and the dancing.  This is a sweet story about good-yet-imperfect people living their lives.

The film is in Hindi, but that doesn't make it harder to enjoy.  In fact, the subtitles add some unintended comedy when the dialog switches to English and the subtitles don't match what's actually being said.  Like all the best Bollywood films, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani will make you wish you could dance.

UPDATE - the packaging of the DVD is worth an additional comment.  In this pricerange you sometimes get a cardboard case with plastic clasp.  Ye Jawaani Hai Deewani has a sleeve and a trifold interior case.  There are two DVDs, the film and the extra materials.  The only downside is that shipping is apparently unpredictable.  It took some time, and arrived before Amazon had it listed on my account as shipped (though I had gotten an email).  The film does have subtitles, but not for the songs.  Odd and disappointing, but hardly a deal breaker.",1377216000,20,1385,4.756302521008403

There are some stand out performances here by Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone.  The story is much better than I thought it would be, after reading some Indian press on the film, and honestly, I absolutely loved the film.

It definitely can stand with most Hollywood films.",1477785600,,405,4.597222222222222

5905326,5,B00EE25ELA,"Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone) is a shy and nerdy medical student. She studies constantly and always tops her classes, but she feels like an outcast due to her introvert nature. An encounter with an old classmate, Aditi Mehra (Kalki Koechlin), makes her realize that she wants more from life than high marks. Thus, she makes an impulsive decision to follow Aditi on a hiking trip into the Himalayas, up to Manali. During the hike, she renews her friendship with other former classmates, Kabir ""Bunny"" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor) and Avinash ""Avi"" Yog (Aditya Roy Kapur). Bunny is a handsome charmer whose dream is to wander and discover the world. He does not plan to marry or settle down. He lives with his supporting father whom he loves very much, and his step-mother. During their trip, seeing Aditi's silent reactions to Avi's constant flirting with other girls, Bunny and Naina realize that she has a secret crush on Avi, but do not bring the matter to surface.

In the course of the mountain trek, Bunny and Naina come closer to each other. Bunny teaches Naina to laugh, to play, and more importantly, to love. At the end of the trip, she is close to telling Bunny how she feels but is interrupted by Avi. He accidentally finds a letter accepting Bunny to graduate school in journalism, at Northwestern University in Chicago. Bunny explains that the trip is his last hometown adventure before he leaves. He is sad to leave his friends but happy to start a career that will lead to travelling, which he dreams of, and thus wanted to bring them along to Manali to give them a surprise. Naina realises that love and marriage have no part in Bunny's plans and remains silent about her feelings but is happy for him as he is following his passion.

Eight years pass by and Naina finishes medical school and now works in a clinic while Bunny works as a videographer for a travel show on Fox Network and travels the world, as he had planned. It is shown that Bunny's father has passed away and due to his job in remote areas, he was not able to attend his last rites. Naina has moved ahead in life and is not waiting to meet Bunny, but they meet in Udaipur, for Aditi's lavish wedding to Taran (Kunaal Roy Kapur), an awkward but sweet engineer, who is rich as Avi and Bunny claim. At the wedding, Bunny and Avi renew their lost friendship.

Naina and Bunny are strongly attracted to each other again. Both resist love  Bunny, because he is not able to figure out that he is in love with Naina and Naina, as she doesn't want to get her heart broken again. A day before the wedding, Bunny sees Naina with another man, Vikram (Rana Daggubati), who is the wedding photographer. He is Naina's friend, but Bunny assumes him to be her boyfriend, feels jealous and argues with him, finally sending him away. Bunny and Naina meet, argue, and reveal their feelings by a kiss. Yet neither of them is willing to give up a career to follow the other. It seems that their romance is over. Bunny also confronts Aditi on her past crush on Avi. She admits that she had feelings for Avi but says that she has gotten over him and is extremely happy with Taran. Bunny leaves for home on the night of Aditi's wedding and will leave for Paris three weeks later for his dream job as a travel show host. On New Year's Eve, as Naina sits alone at home along with her dog, someone knocks on her door and it's Bunny. He surprises her with a kiss. He has turned down his dream job to be with Naina and proposes to her, but Naina fears that he might regret his decision in the future. However, Bunny says that he is happy with Naina and wants to continue travelling but with her. He argues that somehow they can make a life together. Naina agrees. Bunny and Naina then get engaged and finally declare their love properly for one another. They have a conference call between Aditi and Avi. Avi is at his bar and Aditi is at the airport as a newlywed leaving for her honeymoon with Taran. The friends find out about Bunny and Naina and are overwhelmed. Aditi states that she always kind of knew about the sparks between them. They all wish each other a Happy New Year and the film ends with Bunny and Naina smiling and embracing each other.",1467504000,2,4205,4.471354166666667

5905333,5,B00EE25ELA,"What a wonderful movie! Great cinematography, snazzy music, sizzling chemistry between the lead stars, a great supporting cast, all make this a lovely, very watchable movie. The hero has wanderlust- and works as a travel journalist moving from place to place to place and the heroine is as rooted as can be... and the story is about how love finds its way... We are treated to the visual delights of a destination wedding (not of the lead characters) as part of the story plot... the workings of old friendships... the growing apart, the coming back together... all is handled very expertly by the director. One doesn't loose interest even for a moment! Some great location shooting in the Himalayas!
Deepika and Ranbir make an awesome twosome together; Kalki Koechlin gives a beautiful, light and cheerful performance in a supporting role and Aditya Roy Kapoor also does full justice to his subdued role. The only superfluous thing was the ""item number"" by Madhuri Dixit, even so, it was good to see again the mega star from the past! All in all its a movie that I could watch again and again and then again!",1453075200,,1109,4.751295336787565

5905341,3,B00EE25ELA,"My star rating targets the actual production of the DVD, not the movie itself; I love the movie and bought it without reading all of the reviews. With a 2-disc DVD set, it didn't occur to me that the musical number might not be subtitled. But they aren't. The songs in Indian cinema are not just fillers, they are often used to move the plot along and/or build character. This is a major part of Indian cinema. It boggles my mind that these would be skipped. They did, however, take the time to throw up an EROS watermark over the musical numbers, adding a distraction--a major distraction when you don't have subtitled lyrics to read instead. -2 stars for the disappointing subtitle offerings. Otherwise, it is a good set for a great film.",1440201600,,740,4.571428571428571

This movie starts out with a wedding invitation and naina (deepika) reminiscing to 8 years back when she was nerdy,akward,self-conscious and clearly unhappy with the way her life was. She decides on a whim to go on a trip after bumping into an old school mate... and that's when she bumps into bunny (ranbir) and her life begins to change... He helps her to see that she is special and unique in her own way.. if she stops feeling sorry for herself and starts loving herself everything will be fine... due to a career choice on bunny's part after the trip they all go their seperate ways.

8 years later they are all re-united by this wedding

The cinematography is fabulous-enjoyed the bonus video of the making of the movie-and makes me want to visit Manali and the lower Himalayas if I ever get to India. The music is the best and Ranbir in Badtameez Dil is probably the most fun dance number ever! It is why this 65 year young grandmother loves Bollywood movies!",1395187200,,624,4.426086956521739

5905365,4,B00EE25ELA,"My old pal Bollywood Bob and I were chillin' the other day, he munching on a plate of paranthas, me having a Coke and a smile. At some point Bollywood Bob confessed to me that the secret to sustained success rests not on innovation, which is hard to come by, but rather on taking what's old hat and executing the thing with flair and enthusiasm and with competence. And should this be applied to cinema, it helps that the two leads caught up in that familiar old dance generate chemistry. YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI, in giving the people what they want, made a crapload of money at the Indian box office. It perhaps cemented Ranbir Kapoor as Bollywood's fastest rising new superstar and reaffirms that Deepika Padukone is one of today's most engaging, most captivating performers.

My old pal Bollywood Bob snickered when detailing the less-than-fresh plot trajectory. Kabir ""Bunny"" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor) and his two best pals, impulsive Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) and easy-going Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur), are off to a climbing expedition in mountainous Manali. They're joined on a whim by the studious Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone), a casual acquaintance and former classmate who suspects she's been missing out on life and is curious to see what the fuss is all about. The film's first half chronicles their madcap misadventures in Manali. We note the personality traits, the attractions established, the tight-knit group dynamics that shift just so to make room for Naina.

Bespectacled bookworm Naina. Except that when you resemble Deepika Padukone, the opposite sex can't fail to notice. At some point, Bunny, incorrigible ladies' man, drops an observation to Naina: ""Girls like you aren't made for flirting... you're made for love. And love... is very bad for my health.""

If someone were to tell you that the narrative revolves around Bunny's trying to find himself, that someone goofed. Yes, this is a coming-of-age story. But Bunny is well aware of who he is, and what he wants, and how to go about achieving what he wants. What informs the core of the story conflict is Bunny's struggle to prioritize the things that matter to him most. Bunny is a restless soul, his restlessness compelling him to travel the globe, to explore its distant nooks and crannies. It's this wanderlust that severs his ties with his friends, that cuts off whatever it was that had been building between him and Naina. The film's intermission finds Bunny living his dream, a professional vagabond with a camera. It finds Naina moving on.

You live, you love, you suffer heartbreak, you get over it eventually, rinse, repeat... It's not ever cool when my old pal Bollywood Bob starts waxing philosophical on romance; he starts quoting instructions from the dishwashing machine. Post-interval, eight years had elapsed. We ought to catch up. Bunny's career has taken off. Easy-going Avi's has not, and he's not so easy-going anymore, not after a string of failed business enterprises. After years apart, the four friends reunite to attend Aditi's wedding in resplendent Udaipur. In the days leading up to the nuptials, brace yourself for when festering grudges and jealousies are exposed and teary-eyed declarations are blurted out. Oboy, nothing like a lavish Indian wedding to inspire crazy melodrama... and crazy dancing.

Look, just shrug off the heap of clichs. You won't even care about them, this film is that good. YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI preserves a delicate balance. It presents a hip, contemporary perspective while championing traditional values. Bunny is a womanizer and will chase any good-looking tail. Naina fiercely demands her own space independent of her parents' expectations. And yet, push comes to shove, Bunny and Naina exhibit deep affection for their parents. They respectfully take in the wisdom imparted by those elders.

It'd be messed up if I didn't mention how much I enjoyed Kalki Koechlin's performance. Of all the character arcs in this film, hers is the most interesting and unexpected trajectory. She may not be as strikingly photogenic as Deepika, but there's just something about her. Kalki seems to be in the moment in every scene she's in. Meanwhile, Evelyn Sharma's sexy but clueless party girl nabs several choice comic moments. And, as the cherry on top, there's a Madhuri Dixit sighting in the shape of an item number. Yep, she's still got it. There's my old pal Bollywood Bob, drooling.

YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI offers nothing new. You see every twist and complication coming, with the possible exception of Aditi's arc. Watching this, you may smile and weep, and, if you're at that certain age, you may reminisce about when you, too, were young and stood at a crossroad and made mistakes and fell in and out of love and lived life like tomorrows were non-existent. Me, too, man, I did all that.

5905369,5,B00EE25ELA,"Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani directed by Ayan Mukerji was one of the biggest hits of 2013 and it was absolutely charming. Initially I opted to watch the movie only to see Madhuri Dixit perform in the song Gaghra. Id assumed the movie to be a frilly n frothy meaningless run-of-the mill Hindi movie. This movie is definitely frothy, but Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukones honest portrayal of the lead couple warms the heart and made me believe in their love story.",1389139200,,458,4.666666666666667
