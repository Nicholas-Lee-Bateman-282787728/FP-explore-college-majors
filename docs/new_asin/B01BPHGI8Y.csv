8750994,5,B01BPHGI8Y,"This 1994 British TV documentary was released in 1997 on VHS under the title Lullabye of Birdland. It has never been on DVD until now. Its a must-see for jazz pianist Shearing fans but also a big awaking for those who know him by only a few albums. Its been almost 20 years since I saw it and I discovered new things about this blind-from-birth pianist (who also made a record playing accordion with jazz critic Leonard Feather on piano  one of the cool things youll discover here), such as that he can be really funny!

There are a few full performance both in a nightclub in London and in Shearings Manhattan apartment (Hes a naturalized US citizen). Interview with his second wife, his sister, Mel Torme, Cleo Laine and her husband Johnny Dankworth add to the info. There is some early TV footage too. Yes, it is blu-ray  and the images are sharp  but the show was recorded in the last century so note that it is not wide-screen but 4:3 ratio aspect.

As with most other Arthaus productions, there is a 16-page booklet included with a 2  page essay in three languages  plus photos. There are  of course  no bonus features on the disc.

As I said, Im glad it is back so those who missed it on VHS can enjoy it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
