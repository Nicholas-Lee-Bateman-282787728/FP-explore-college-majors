7673331,3,B01C9O7D40,"My grandkids (and I) love Scooby Doo, and they also like Legos, and the Lego movies, so this DVD seemed like a sure winner.  It wasn't.  There wasn't the easy humor we usually find in a Scooby Doo mystery.  It just felt labored, plus the Lego figures did not seem natural in their movements.  It wasn't bad, just disappointing.",1465084800,3,327,4.491525423728813

7673333,5,B01C9O7D40,"Cassandra Peterson, aka Elvira Mistress of the Dark , does voice acting in this one.
I personally still hope beyond hope for a proper Scooby Doo meets Elvira direct release movie or TV Crossover. They are meant to be. 2 of the greatest comedy/monster icons there are!
Both of them had a great affinity for Vincent Price, so, what's taking Elvira so long? Or Scooby!?

As to the meat of the review:
It's totally watchable. This is a good Scooby Doo movie. Nothing in it makes me shy away thinking 'What are they doing to my Scooby now!?"" like some movies in the last few years.
It's probably good enough for a limited theatrical release or something. They did this one pretty well. I don't write spoiler reviews, so, It's in my second tier of Scooby Movies, which is totally a great review.
My best are Witch's Ghost, Zombie Island, Camp Scare.
It's probably closer to Scooby Doo in CyberSpace but better than Pirate's Ahoy.
I'm watching it again this weekend.",1464998400,5,959,4.608187134502924

It's something we can sit down and enjoy together. I have the LEGO Scooby Doo van that I bought for my birthday that my son has seen, but not touched! I know he'd destroy it not meaning too so it's in my bonus room. It was very fitting to buy this movie since I already have the van. My sons just gotten into Batman and has enjoyed most the LEGO Batman movies lately. I knew since he's watched those he was ready to watch this one. It's a cute movie plot and everything. I've actually seen 3/4 of it, but not the whole thing since we're getting ready to list our house and I haven't gotten the time to fully sit down and watch the whole thing. He has actually watched it 3-4x today and it came out Tuesday. He kept begging to keep turning it back on today while he plays with his cars in his playroom.",1463184000,3,978,3.9444444444444446

7673346,5,B01C9O7D40,"Set in a LEGO world, the Scooby gang try to rescue an old movie studio, which is not only threatened by developers who want to tear it down, but by a series of movie monsters, which are suddenly haunting the place.

My son has a number to the LEGO Scooby Doo sets, so it was fun for him to see these toys come to life!  I loved the animation and watching the  LEGOs crumble and fall apart if broken.  It totally looked like real LEGOs.  I also found it funny that when they built a LEGO jail by assembling pieces that the bad guys couldn't get out.

Not only does this movie tie into the LEGO sets, but also a throw back to some of the classic Scooby Doo movies and TV episodes!  This featured classic bad guys:  Headless Horseman, the Mummy and the Zombie.  The Scooby Gang also got to try their hand a new jobs like acting, directing and not just being super sleuths!
