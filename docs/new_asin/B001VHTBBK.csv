3822525,5,B001VHTBBK,These are not the Disney versions.  They are actually better and a much better value.  They are much more interesting.  I think this is worth checking out.  My kids love this.,1271721600,,175,4.548387096774194
3822526,5,B001VHTBBK,"5 diffrent very well animated movies of princesses. Each movie is about 45 minutes long...almost 4 hours of animated princess movies for the kids in a 2 disc set. My daughter loves it...it's not Disney but it if fun and very enjoyable. Set includes Snow White, Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Little Princess and Cinderella.

3822529,5,B001VHTBBK,"These are not supposed to be ""knock offs"" of Disney. In matter fact, some of these were even released before Disney! They are very cute films. My oldest sister gave this to me when I was about 8 years old (turning 16 soon) and I still love them to this day. I would watch these at night when I couldn't sleep or if I had a bad dream. The Little Princess and Pocahontas were my favorites out of all them (all of them were good). I suggest buying these even though they aren't Disney. Who cares if it isn't Disney? Disney isn't even the creator of these fairy tales!",1470268800,,564,4.18348623853211

If I could give negative stars , I would give it the most it could possibly get. Shame on you. I will continue to use amazon because they are generally good. I just have to be more careful about who I choose to  get the items from. Once again, very disappointed. My little girl knows Disney, not this knock off stuff.

3822560,3,B001VHTBBK,My daughter loves this video which is why I have 3 stars only because I was under impression that this was Disney version of these movies and it definately is not that. But like I said my 3 year old likes movies either way so it's worth the price of $7 I paid.,1364688000,,260,3.9245283018867925

3822562,3,B001VHTBBK,The service is great. The movie was in great shape when it arrived and it arrived well before the time it was supposed to be here by. The only thing is my daughter just didn't really care for it. She's 2 but she knew these were not the disney princesses and overall just didn't really want to watch them. She tried out all 5 movies that are on the disc but only watched each of them for maybe 10 minutes.,1361491200,,404,4.0625

3822566,1,B001VHTBBK,"Buyer beware! Don't assume these to be Disney movies. They are generics, and of medium quality.  My kids were very disappointed in these.",1358294400,3,137,4.956521739130435

3822569,1,B001VHTBBK,"This item was not what we thought. We thought we were getting the ""Disney"" movies, not generic ones. So, we were very disappointed.",1351555200,4,131,4.739130434782608
3822570,5,B001VHTBBK,"I purchased this for my 18 mo old in the car so I wouldn't have to change the DVD so often. She loves every story. They are short enough that she doesn't loose interest. The stories are great and I enjoy listening to them. The music isn't Disney quality but it is still fun for my daughter, so I can't complain.",1350864000,3,311,4.114754098360656
3822571,1,B001VHTBBK,So I am sure it is my fault for not reading all the details of my product but the movies are not Disney and so I was pretty disappointed when then showed up.  I will say that the shipping was amazing and was here the next day BUT when my 2 year old and I opened her movie she and I were both pretty disappointed to see that it was just a bunch of short videos that were not Disney on one DVD.,1345593600,6,392,3.7228915662650603
3822572,5,B001VHTBBK,"Though it's not the Disney classics I am used to, my 2 year old loves them! That's all that's really important. The movies are cute and teach moral values to children through narrative and story!  I would definitely purchase it again",1339545600,9,233,4.682926829268292
3822573,5,B001VHTBBK,"Sure, it's not Disney but it's still pretty great! I grew up with these videos as a kid and loved every minute of them. The animation is of a little lower quality but the story/songs/etc are really fun for kids. Definitely great for kids. :)",1335571200,21,241,4.377777777777778
3822574,2,B001VHTBBK,"Here's the problem. When I ordered this, I expected REAL princesses, not totally different princesses with different looks and different names.  In ""The Little Mermaid"", they changed Arielle's name to ""Princess Lena"", Ursula's to ""Cassandra"", and Prince Eric's to ""Prince Stefan!!! Not to mention Arielle is known for her red hair, but they changed it to blonde.  In ""Cinderella"", they changed Cinderella's hair from blonde to red.  They seemed to have Arielle's and Cinderella""s hair color mixed up!  The animations for all the movies are totally different, and I am very disappointed.",1333584000,3,586,5.336956521739131
