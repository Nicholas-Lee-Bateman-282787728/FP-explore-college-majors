2137594,5,B0002XVQT4,"The first and second seasons of kind of the hill are great on DVD.  I'm sure the third season will be no exception.  When previewing the episodes on this DVD, it's obvious that many of the funniest shows are in the third season.",1097193600,2,228,4.27906976744186
2137595,5,B0002XVQT4,"ONE OF THE BEST SEASONS THIS IS. BUT NO EXTRAS. WHA. HOW. WHY. Well as lots of people know this season was supposed to come out early 2004. Well since it got pushed back to December 28th 2004 if they would have put extras on it would have come out till middle of 2005. Maybe it would have been worth the wait but I don't get this:
SEASON 1 - 13 EPISODES - 50 DELETED SCENES
SEASON 2 - 22 EPISODES - 197 DELETED SCENES
SEASON 3 - 25 EPISODES - 0 DELETED SCENES
CMON WHATS WITH THAT.

OVERALL this a great season of episodes and is really worth $30. It is really funny to watch over and over again and will be a good addition to your sets.

2137759,4,B0002XVQT4,"The Hills are back with their neighbors and friends for a glorious third season including all 25 episodes. Guest voices include Uta Hagen and Betty White and Phyllis Diller when Hank must drive his mother and her elderly friends to the miniatures museum far away. Cotton is back and DeeDee is pregnant. Hank and Peggy both want to have another child in this season but it's not easy with Hank's narrow urethra. Bobby starts becoming interesting in girls and even has his first girlfriend.

The twenty five episodes are glorious here on 3 double sided discs in a slim case package to preserve them. If you loved the series, you will enjoy this season. Bill is heartbroken over Lenore's abandonment. Dale can't figure out that his wife and John Redcorn are more than good friends or his son's paternity. Boomhower is still the ladies' man. Then there are the neighbors, a Laotian family with their ups and downs. Luann is still there and trying to survive beauty school.

Still if you loved the Simpsons or Family Guy, you will love and enjoy this series. It lacks the vulgarity and offensiveness of ""Family Guy"" and it's more realistic than ""The Simpsons."" The Voices are still the same and more guest appearances. I am upset that they don't have any extra features though like in the first two seasons.",1452297600,,1302,4.7312775330396475

2137860,1,B0002XVQT4,"One of my favorite shows. I couldn't wait to get ahold of all the seasons since being taken off of netflix. I already had season 1 with the cardboard outer shell with each dvd contained in its own clamshell case. When I bought it, every dvd was flawless.

I ordered seasons 2-6 and every one was in a single plastic case with this plastic wing in the middle holding two dvds. EVERY case was damaged in some manner and almost every dvd throughout all of the seasons had experienced some kind of scratching. Some of it was due to the spindle holding the dvd being broke allowing the dvd to just rattle around, some had the plastic wing just rattling around with the two dvds on it just rubbing back and forth, and others were just rubbing each other to the HORRIBLE case design. I am currently trying to get a refund or exchange for the sets that have each dvd individually cased. I suggest you do the same if you order these sets.

Great show, horrible case design.",1382832000,3,964,4.379888268156424

Also another reason why FOX has not released any other seasons after season 6 on DVD. CHEAP SOB'S!!

There is no bonus content for the season 3 (and onwards) DVDs at all.  Nothing.  Even the menus feel cheap and tacked on.  It's like they spent no time on these things.  They crammed everything onto double sided disks to save a few bucks, and gave us no extra content because that would cost them 1 extra disk - like, 50 cents extra per DVD set.

Seasons one and two had these extras.

But season three has NO EXTRAS.

Just the episodes.  The same exact ones I have on tape, and have seen many times (okay, so I have no life).

Bottom line - if you're a big fan, and already have these on tape (or an even bigger fan and burned them on DVD long ago) don't bother.  Wait until you see the set in a used DVD store for a couple bucks.

On the other hand, if you're a fan who doesn't have season three stuff at your disposal, go for it.  Season three is still fairly pure (no shark jumping quite yet).

2137937,5,B0002XVQT4,"Initially aired following the 1997 Super Bowl, King of the Hill discovered an instant audience niche that has the followed the show loyally ever since. The brainchild of Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge (also known for the hit movie Office Space), King of the Hill is a unique animated series in that it doesn't rely on ""cartoon"" suspension of reality or outlandish antics. In fact, the show would arguably be just as successful if it were not animated at all. Nevertheless, it's Mike Judge (voice of Hank Hill) and his unique brand of humor that make King of the Hill a must-see TV series...

Set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, King of the Hill follows the life and exploits of Hank Hill and his traditional nuclear family. Hank is a red-state propane salesman who loves beer and apple pie, but he's constantly inundated with modern liberalism and grapples with the demands of political correctness. Hank is joined by his wife Peggy (a substitute teacher), his son Bobby (an awkward pre-pubescent youth), and a trailer park-like live-in niece named Luanne... Providing added comic relief to the series are Hank's off-the-wall friends Bill, Boomhauer (who is inaudible), and Dale (who believes everything is a government conspiracy)... Hank's Laotian neighbor Kahn (whose daughter Bobby is quite fond of) and his family live next door, providing Hank with a continuing dose of culture shock...

The King of the Hill (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Death of a Propane Salesman"" in which Hank and Luanne narrowly escape a propane explosion at the Mega Lo Mart, prompting Hank to develop a job-threatening fear of propane. Meanwhile, Luanne (who had her hair burnt off in the explosion) follows in the footsteps of Sinead O'Connor and becomes a community activist... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Pregnant Paws"" in which Hank becomes obsessed in his effort to breed his dog, and ""The Wedding of Bobby Hill"" in which the Hill family, in order to teach Bobby a valuable lesson, manage to convince him that he'll have to marry his cousin Luanne...

Below is a list of episodes included on the King of the Hill (Season 3) DVD:

2137940,5,B0002XVQT4,"I know I'm repeating myself here and I'm basically just echoing what I said in my own previous reviews of Seasons 1 and 2, but King of the Hill isn't the crazy world of The Simpsons or Family Guy, it's set in a much more realistic and subtle universe. Yes there is eccentric humor but it's pulled off in a convincing, un-contrived way, which makes it even more ingenius.

I love the animation. It's not the bright primary colors of regular animated shows, but more of a pencil sketch kinda appearance (sorry, that is the best description I can give as I am not up on animation lingo). And the characters and voices are perfect. How can you not feel sorry for Bill, or not fall in love with Louanne (who pretty much has the most gorgeous voice I've ever heard)?

Though KOTH is more willing to have characters grow and change the formula(very unusual for sitcoms) you can bet your bottom dollar that Hank is still a strict regular joe, Dale is a paranoid coward, Bill is still lonely, Boomhauer is incomprehensible (but he does get a brilliant moment in the episode 'A Fire Fighting We Will Go') and Hank's dad is still a highly, highly sexist old geezer with a pregnant girlfriend.

Much like Season 2, this Season ends with a great cliffhanger. Grandpa's girlfriend goes into labor and 12-year-old Bobby has to make the 2-hour drive to the hospital as Hank and Peggy go skydiving, only to end in a horrible accident (Peggy's chute doesn't open and she goes SPLAT!)

I want Season 4 NOW! There were no extras in this set, but there were plenty in the previous box sets so it's okay by me if they are sacrificed in order to get Season 4 out quicker.

The episodes are all presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround.",1106438400,7,1736,4.481012658227848
2137941,4,B0002XVQT4,"I am only one here utterly dissapointed with this product (mind you i haven't read all the reviews yet).

Lack of Special Features:

Sure, not all DVDs have special features, and they are in no way a prerequisite to claiming a DVD or DVD set to be 'great'. However, DVD products have gotten to the point where it is not only expected that they include these features, but that these features be worth our while standalone. Considering how in the KOTH season 1 and 2 releases, the special features were numerous and might I add flavourful. Deleted scenes and commentary for the bulk of the episodes. No such luxuries in this set.

DVD Art and Menus:

When I got Season 1, I found the DVD covers (not the box cover) and the individual menu screnes both humurous and creative, but nothing spectacular. Then with the purchase of Season 2, I was estatic to see that not only had they continued that trend, but that they had upped the bar to such an extend. I really enjoyed the individual casing and DVD for each member of the Hank's posse, and each Menu screen representing one of their more popular settings. Season 3 however, took a step back with amateurish (not that i could draw any better) drawn close ups of the Hill Family. On the CDs, there is no art at all because, and I'm only guessing this is why, Fox decided to cut costs and print double sided discs (I Hate double sided disks, but thats a nut for another day). The Menu art choppy, not to mention not nearly as inventive as i would have hoped; way to damn repeative.

DVD Errors:

I'm actually not that upset about this but I'll point it out anyway (might only be my copy thought). Whenever I use the 'Play All' Feature, it repeats the last chapter of the fisrt episode on that side of this disc. Annoying, but trivial.

For Episodes Alone This DVD is worth it, although I prefered Season 2.

In the end I'm just being a picky bastard. I love KOTH; still think it beats Simpsons and Family Guy, as well as most any sitcom, out of the water. I just don't understand the seemingly rushed job FOX did here. I mean the original release date was almost a year ago, and it appears pushing it back was not in order to better it. After all that waiting, I just feel dissapointed.",1106092800,2,2233,4.389830508474576
2137942,3,B0002XVQT4,"King Of The Hill has become one of those ""like it or hate it"" shows. I have found myself on both sides of the fence at one time or another but...upon reflection, this show ranks as one of the best comedies on television right now. It differs from The Simpsons and South Park in that it doesn't lampoon life so much as it presents it in animated form. The story lines are plausible for the most part (could a man walk around without shins, however, and father a child at the age of seventy whether or not he ""killed fiddy men"" in the war??).

This is a season that began with a boom (the explosion of the Mega-Lo-Mart) and ended with a thud (Peggy Hill falling to earth when her parachute wouldn't open).

In between, this stands up as the best season so far...as they say on the front of the box ""Emmy Award Winning Season!""...and it doesn't take long to see why.

Whether dealing with loss (of life and hair)in ""Death Of A Propane Salesman"", infidelity (Peggy finally clues in on Dale's wife's affair in ""Peggy's Headache""...the last to know as usual), young love (""And They Call It Bobby Love""), cross dressing (""Pretty,Pretty Dresses""), sports (""Three Coaches And A Bobby', ""Hank's Cowboy Movie"", ""Take Me Out Of The Ball Game'), Hank is still insecure and indignant, Peggy is still vain and Bobby is still experiencing the growing pains of a child who seems a little...well...different.

We see Hank's attempt to breed his dog, his struggles to raise his sperm count only to find out his father is becoming a father again, a lawn mower focus group, Hank, Bill, Boomhauer and Dale as the worst volunteer fire fighters you'll ever meet, Paddlin Peggy Hill, Bobby ""marrying"" Luanne, Hank's colon on display at an art gallery and Bobby burning down the church. All this and so much more.

The episodes are fantastic and presented well here. The problem? Unlike the first two boxed sets which presented a huge plethora of extras, you get nothing here...nada...zilch...zip. They had always had a advantage in the DVD game on the other two aforementioned and now they've gone and ruined it. Yes, we get all 25 episodes...but people buy the DVDs for the extras too and for those who look for these, I couldn't recommend purchasing this set. If you love the show (as I do...at least right now), it's a great addition to the collection, probably the best 25 shows they'll do...but, guys, you have to give us something. You can't give us a banquet one time then nothing the next. Five stars for the shows and zip for the extras I'll tell you what!",1105833600,5,2540,4.623059866962306

I enjoyed the entire set, King of the Hill marathons for all.  I have NO idea why people complain about less disks w/o pictures, I for one watch the episodes.

2137944,1,B0002XVQT4,What was FOX thinking when they produced this DVD set. Cheap...thats what they were thinking. Take a great long running show and put out a cheap 3 double sided disc set that doesn't match with the first two seasons which were given great DVD sets. I personally want them to re-release Season 3 with the same treatment the first two seasons were given. The packaging is part of the reason I buy the DVDs. If I wanted plain discs I would download the episodes on the internet illegally and burn them on a disc. FOX has done so well up until this point and I hope that they are not leaning towards double sided discs for future seasons of the Simpsons and other shows. Go back to the one sided discs FOX. Give the fans what they are paying for.,1104710400,10,741,4.3
2137945,3,B0002XVQT4,"I have read a few other reviews and I agree that it is lacking.  The whole point of putting TV on DVD is for at least a few extras.  What I miss the most is the character's commentaries... I have watched them from seasons 1 and 2 and laugh harder each time I watch them.  I think the show really grew into its skin during season 3, but not putting any goodies on the DVDs isn't fair to the loyal fans.  I could have taped episodes off the TV and gotten the same set!",1104710400,2,466,3.925531914893617
2137946,3,B0002XVQT4,"How can Fox treat an Emmy-Award Winning season of a show that is entering it's 9th season so poorly? Season One and Two brought us deleted scenes, single-sided discs with clever artwork, and hysterical commentaries...

Season Three treats it's fans to absolutely nothing, and that's NOT an exageration. There is not one single extra. No disc art, because you have to flip them over to see all the episodes. Hello? Is this the 20th or 21st century? This is a cheap excuse for a boxed-set. I'd love to return this set, but the episodes are so dang good...they're brilliantly animated, acted and written...unlike this terrible boxed set.

It's very sad to see such a brilliant, classic show treated so disrespectfully.

One thing I absolutely loved about the first two box sets was audio commentary done by the King of the Hill characters themselves. This set was advertised a long time ago so you would assume that they would have been taking a long time putting together commentary tracks and other extras. Seeing as how I have seen most of these episodes in syndicated reruns ad naseum, I was really really expecting new, great, character commentaries.",1104537600,3,557,4.58
2137948,2,B0002XVQT4,"FOX really pulled one over on everyone this time. Not a single solitary extra in this boxset. None. Not one. They really cheaped out on this one. 3 double-sided DVDs. Thats it. As a collector, this one really dissapointed me. Why FOX continues to treat KOTH like an ugly stepchild is really a mystery to me. You don't see them skimping on the ""Simpsons"" box sets (Season 5 is brimming with bonus material.

The episodes are still great, but with reruns being played to death on FX, plus the show's time slot being victim to Fox's NFL schedule, this set offers fans nothing except owning the episodes themselves on DVD.

Buyer beware!",1104537600,6,633,4.642857142857143
2137949,4,B0002XVQT4,"The packaging and features on Season 3 is not as impressive as seasons 1 and 2.  The three discs are double-sided so you don't have the artwork on the discs.  There are also no extras which, to me, is not that big of a deal although I know hardcore fans will be disappointed.  I hardly look at the extras or listen to the commentaries on my Simpsons, Family Guy, King of the Hill, and South Park DVDs.  To me, the extras slow down the release of episodes I want to watch although this set was advertised to be released last spring.  Still, most of these episodes are great.  It is nice to have a character on TV like Hank Hill who stands up for decency and for what is right.  There ain't a lot of characters like him on television today, I tell you what.  Anyway, here are the discs and their content:

Disc 1: Death of a Propane Salesman: The second part of the Mega-Lo Mart explosion cliff hanger from season 2.

And They Call it Bobby Love: Bobby falls in love with an older girl while the guys fall in love with an old couch left in their alley.

Peggy's Headache: One of my favorites.  Peggy must be the last person in Arlen (well, besides Dale) to discover that John Redcorn is doing more than ""healing"" Nancy.

Pregnant Paws: Hank tries to get Lady Bird pregnant and Dale tries to become a bounty hunter.

Next of Shin: Hank's ""narrow urethra"" seems even more narrow when he finds out his dad's young wife is pregnant.

Peggy Pageant Fever:  One of my least favorites because it makes me so mad at the overly conceited Peggy who thinks she's so smart and beautiful but has almost no chance to win ""Mrs. Heimlich County.""

Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men: One of my favorites.  A take-off (in a way) of the classic film ""12 Angry Men"" only this time a lawnmower is on trial and Hank is its sole supporter.  It also finally shows Hank sticking up for his mother amid Cotton's constant attacks.

Good Hill Hunting: Now that he is 12, Bobby needs to kill a deer to complete his first ""rite of passage,"" but Hank was too late in buying the hunting permits.

Pretty, Pretty Dresses:  This is a very disturbing (and hilarious) look at Bill and how he is coping (or not coping) with his divorce.

Disc 2: A Firefighting We Will Go:  Hank joins a volunteer firefighting team with the incompetent and unreliable Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer.

To Spank With Love: Peggy unexpectedly earns the approval of Cotton as well as the nickname ""Paddlin' Peggy""when she spanks a smart-alec student.

Three Coaches and a Bobby: When a tough coach takes over the football team, Bobby does the unthinkable...he ""leaves sports and joins a soccer team.""

De-Khanstructing Henry:  Khan brags about his new job to Hank and reveals too much information.

The Wedding of Bobby Hill: This is a rather silly episode.  To punish Bobby for sabotaging Luanne's BCPs, the Hills make Bobby think he has to marry Luanne.

Sleight of Hank: Hank clashes with a magician.

Jon Vitti Presents: `Return to La Grunta': Hank is violated by a Dolphin.

Escape from Party Island: Hank drives his mother and her friends to a miniatures museum only to find himself in the middle of an MTV party.

Disc 3: Love Hurts...And So Does Art: An x-ray of Hank's beef-filled colon is turned into high art.

Hank's Cowboy Movie:  Hank and the gang hope to convince the Cowboys to move their training camp to Arlen.

Dog Dale Afternoon: Dale's paranoia goes a bit over the edge when he starts believing his riding mower was stolen by Lee Harvey Oswald.

Revenge of the Lutefisk: Bobby accidentally burns down the church.

Death and Texas: Peggy thinks she's helping a former student now on Death Row but is really helping him get cocaine.

Wings of the Dope: Includes one of my favorite Hank lines: ""There is no Buckley's Angel, there was barely a Buckley.""

Take Me Out of the Ball Game: Peggy becomes the star pitcher of the Strickland Propane softball team.

As Old As the Hills: The Hills celebrate their twentieth anniversary by sky diving...with terrible results for Peggy that will continue in season 4.

This set is definitely value for your dollar. I hope Season 4 comes out soon so I can have my second favorite episode (behind ""Hank's Unmentionable Problem""); the one with the low flow toilets.",1104364800,13,4246,4.5682119205298015
2137950,3,B0002XVQT4,"I just got my collection in the mail. Any day with KOTH is a good one, of course, but where are the extras? Come on, Fox, I want my character commentary, my deleted scenes, my reasons I buy DVDs in the first place. I now have all three sets, but if Fox can't see fit to include some extras in the next set, my collection will be capped at three.",1104364800,,345,3.942857142857143
