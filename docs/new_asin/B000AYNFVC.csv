2398571,5,B000AYNFVC,"...until You have this set. A friend turned me onto this series and I thought to myself ""Lonewolf and Babycart? This is going to be cheesy"" but O'contrare! Instead this is some of the best directing I have ever seen in this genre in addition to the gore factor which should make fans likes me happy who also love horror. Althought the premises of righteous anger has been done many many times before Lonewolf does not expect you to feel bad for him. In fact he doesn't care he just wants bloody revenge on the Shogun and any ninja he meets. There are many references to these movies in pop culture.  Any self respecting Kung Fu movie lover will expect you to see it. Go buy it! You'll watch it over and over again.",1183593600,,714,4.3283582089552235
2398572,5,B000AYNFVC,"I'm a huge fan of martial arts films in general, samurais in particular. Part of the problem, for me, in finding samurai films I'd like is the tendency of Japanese filmamkers to include odd humor and action scenes that are too unbelievable. Now, I like unrealistic action fights, I can watch Drunken Master 2 or Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon all day, but sometimes you can take fantasy too far--in the anime version of Samurai Showdown, Haohmaru the samurai defeats a swarm of bees with his sword by chopping them up. A bit too much.

The reason I bring this up is to let anyone who has the same taste as I do in martial arts films (fantasy fighting with some gravity to it) know that they'll enjoy these movies as much as anything they've seen.

First off, the story is just great in each film. You really can't predict the actions and decisions that lead hero, Ogami Itto, will make. He's the perfect samurai character, grim, silent, and ruthlessly efficient. I was a bit leary about Tomisaburo Wakaya, as he's not the vision of the ultimate samurai, but his fine acting and martial arts chops make you forget about his double chin. Upon first seeing him, I wished they had cast an actor who looked mroe like the comicbook Ogami Itto--twenty minutes into a film, I forgot all about the comics.

The action is just incredibly well done. It's not the beautiful, agile swordplay of the Chinese sword films, but it has an elegance to it. Whereas the Chinese like to draw out a fight and have both warriors display every move in their arsenal, the Japanese directors tend to focus on a single, perfect stroke. The fights are fast and furious, with limbs and fountains of blood. For those seeking to avoid blood and guts, you might want to rethink getting this. Just think of the final action scene in the phenomenal Kill Bill Vol. 1, where the bride decimates the Crazy 88. Now imagine that scene with someone who actually knows martial arts, and you'll get the idea.

Anyway, let me just say that these six flicks are MY Star Wars. The ultimate samurai saga, bar none. If only Kenji Masume and Kazuo Koike would ahve made a Musashi film.",1162598400,16,2135,4.595800524934384
2398573,5,B000AYNFVC,"this six film series is about the former shogun excutioner,now on the run from his insane shogun(after the shogun has his family killed,but missing the lone wolf and his young son) and getting ready to take the old man out.(but only after killing the shogun's son in front of him) and now works as an assision and advenger to anyone with the right amount of gold.

  this is bloddy,gory,and over the top,but thats whats so good about it. the action looks like the kind jhon woo uses today,and the other parts of the story really come together and make this the most fun you can have watching this ""sword and kung-fu"" series!! enjoy",1147824000,3,631,4.566371681415929
2398574,5,B000AYNFVC,"this is the first film in a series of 6 movies that has some of the best sword and kung-fu play in any other movie you will ever see. lone wolf worked for the shogun as his excutioner until the shogun goes crazy and has lone wolf's family killed. his young son is saved and the two start down the road of revenge and become hit men of their time to eat.

this is bloody and not for the kids, but for adults this is one of the better kung-fu movies out there. the action must be seen to be believed. not to be missed",1139443200,6,515,3.9047619047619047
2398575,5,B000AYNFVC,"For pure, unadulterated, visceral entertainment, the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series can't be beat.  The acting, directing, the screenplays, and the cinematography are all top notch.  The action sequences have to be seen to be believed.  Each and every film feature loads of ""money shots"".  Fans of Tarantino will immediately see where he drew much of his inspiration for the ""Kill Bill"" series.  I suspect that these movies were an influence on ""Mighty Python and the Holy Grail"" as well. Another little known fact is that the manga that this is based upon was also the inspiration for ""Road to Perdition"".

People with no experience with Japanese cinema will probably find these movies to be very bizarre the first time they see them.  They depict a culture whose morals and values are quite different from Western standards.  Its not uncommon in these movies for someone to kill, or commit suicide, for reasons not easily comprehended. Examples:  in Volume 2, a cult of female ninjas brutally dismember and kill one of their allies, just to prove a point (that they're superior fighters).  In volume 6, one thug after another joyfully sacrifice their lives in order to help a princess perfect her killing technique.  In volume 3, following a brutal rape and murder, a Samurai attempts to help the criminals cover up their atrocity.  His actions are depicted as honorable behavior.

The main character, Ogami Itto, can only be described as an anti-hero. An assassin by trade, he describes himself as evil, a demon, ""one who walks along the crossroads of Hell"".  He will kill anyone for 500 pieces of gold, even women and children.  The opening scene in the first film sets the tone of the series, when Ogami, the official executioner of the Shogun, brutally decapitates a toddler.  Even so, he is portayed throughout the series as a very sympathetic, honorable character.  You will find yourself rooting for him and his son.

I can't say enough good things about these movies.  They are so satisfying on every level.  You'll get a rush at the over-the-top scenes of violence.  You may even begin to question your Westernized notions of morality.  Be cautioned though:  these movies are not for the squeamish.  Volume 1 and 3, in particular, feature very disturbing depictions of rape and murder.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1126569600,94,2322,4.907455012853471

2398581,5,B000AYNFVC,"I bought this to replace the set we own on Laser disc. A couple of years ago our laser player bit the dust and we have not gotten around to seeing if it's still repairable, that technology is so old, it may not be possible to repair it and so every now and then, I replace the films we really like as our budget allows. This was one I hated to lose, we were introduced to a stripped down, single film version years ago by a friend who told us it was the craziest most entertaining movie he'd ever seen. That film was called 'Shogun Assassin' and it was a rather poorly edited movie made from scraps of these original films compiled into one.

Upon researching martial arts films, my husband discovered that it was created from this series and we decided to buy the first movie. Back then, this was not readily available for rent anywhere and we were obliged to buy it if we wanted to see it. After the first pilot film, we ran out and bought the other five. Not only are the original films more cohesive than the chopped up Shogun Assassin version, but the cinematography is spectacular, capturing the presentation of those old classic Samurai movies from the 60's but in color and with an artistry to the scene compositions. I have been disappointed by some of the more contemporary Samurai flicks; some of the new ones have a rather disjointed filming style that leaves me feeling there was little to connect the story between (often well choreographed) fight scenes and I want a good story to flesh things out. There have been a few good new ones but for the most part, I like the old classics.

I mention this because there are many versions of the Lone Wolf and Cub series; it was has been reproduced for television in the 1970's with the same director (Kenji Misumi) but different actors than the series of full length films and again in early 2000 with a completely different cast and crew. My review is of the original films made starting in 1972 and on through 1974 starring Tomisabur Wakayama as the protagonist/hero Ogami Itto.",1416873600,3,2038,4.505405405405406

Mostly he lets his sword do the talking, and talk it does, gleefully sending up geysers of arterial blood.  As for the baby-cart he solemnly pushes along?  Think bamboo Batmobile, full of surprises for the unwary --and they're all unwary.  The superb 70s funk/fusion soundtrack sends the show right over the top.",1375056000,,542,4.78494623655914
2398597,3,B000AYNFVC,I thought this movie was good but over rated. The action sequences were good and there were a lot of parts of the plot that were very original for its time. The guy who played lone wolf must have had real experience using katanas? The one thing that had me using my fast forward button a lot were the rape scenes and the child nudity. They could a have left out the parts of lone wolf taking baths with his son. It kinda ruined it for me when I would start getting into it then they would show that. I was also disappointed in the ending. I don't know if they planned more or not but it didn't bring closure to the story after hours of watching them. Like I said not a bad movie but certainly not Seven Samurai.,1374624000,3,711,4.085714285714285

2398600,5,B000AYNFVC,"I am writing this review to speak of the video and audio quality, not of the movie.  (I am a Lone Wolf and Cub fan, and of Japanese cinema and culture as well, so this collection, in literary terms, is an absolute prize in my eyes.)

For reference, I watched these blurays my QuadHD (1440p) S-IPS monitor with full color gamut utilizing nVidia's edge enhancement for 1440p video instead of 1080p.  Its ""fake"" 1440p, but trust me, it really makes everything sharper. 1080p blurays, at full bit-rate, look absolutely phenomenal.  All this techno-babble merely means I have a great setup for image evaluation.  (I'm also a graphic designer and artist, so I have a trained eye for detail.) (Not trying to humblebrag, just giving some credentials before I rave how AWESOME this bluray is.)

This video transfer seems to have an excellent bit-rate, I notice no compression or artifacts.  And this is saying a lot considering each of the bluray discs has (3) movies squeezed into it, each movie weighing in at about 13GB.  Some blurays I have ""backedup"" on my hard-drive consume upwards of 35GB per single movie.  But all of the included movies in this collection, even being only 13GB in size, look wonderful.  (Do yourself a favor, and forget about compressing them, they deserve maximum bit-rate.  The main reason I didn't...errrr...""borrow"" these new releases off of the internet is that this collection is so awesome I do not want someone else's encoded and compressed version, I want every bit of perfection that I can get)

(There are no bluray extras, which I am HAPPY about as the fullest possible amount of disc capacity was spent on presenting the max quality version of the actual film, a great decision/coincidence in my book.  I very, very rarely enjoy any ""extras"" at all as it is....)

The bit-rate of these movies stays well above 20,000, even approaching 30,000 at times.  This bluray transfer used original film footage and employed DNR, digital noise reduction. DNR gives a smoother, crisper image while sacrificing fine film grain and detail.  However, the image for this Lone Wolf and Club collection is absolutely superb.  The colors are very rich and detail is retained rather very well.  You will not find the extremely fine detail/film grain as a modern movie shot on a digital 4k RED camera, so this is just about the best possible image we can get.  This is as good as a transfer as I could have asked for; remember, this is a FOREIGN film made in 1972 and is a CULT classic (small market/demand), films having those three criteria very rarely get such a good bluray treatment.  I am so glad that some idiot did not get a hold of this wonderful movie collection and mess it up.  i would have been pissed.  Good job, Animeigo!  (No, I don't work for them....)

This is the definitive Lone Wolf and Cub collection.  Perhaps one day we will get a 4k release!  The mega hit classics like North by Northwest already have been scanned in at 8k and will be released soon in 4k format when 4k tvs go mainstream.  We are coming up on that very soon.  We probably will see this collection in 4k format ONE DAY, but that's going to be a loooooooong time; probably much longer than it took to bring it to bluray.  And the jump from bluray to 4k, while very noticeable and pleasing, is not equal to the giant leap as from DVD (480p) to Bluray (1080p).  4k has 4 times the resolution of 1080p, but you start to have the issue of ""diminishing returns"", meaning that, while the resolution is 4 times more, your eye will sort of ""max out"", the picture will be better but definitely not 4 times better.  Additionally, we are also limited by the quality of the original film masters/copies.

Ahhhh...I almost forgot the AUDIO!  There is not much to say, its a standard 2.0 stereo mix, as was very common place back in those days.  If you have the means to do so, or are an audiophile like me, try messing around with some surround sound emulators.  You'd be surprised at the pleasing effects that tactfully adjusted surround sound can bring out of a 2.0 mix.  (Just don't go overboard with it, maybe just use quadraphonic settings....)  Maybe in the future we can get a 5.1 mix, but that would require quite some additional cost on the part of the publisher.  However, if decades into the future this collection is released again in even higher quality, some sort of 5.1 mix will HAVE to be created....

Also, in case you are wondering, there is no English dub, which is of absolutely no consequence since I would personally consider that an offense to use while watching this movie.  Part of the wonder of these movies is the ethnography of Edo Japan you get, of which the original Japanese language is critical.  Apparently the Japanese spoken in this film is the equivalent of ""Old English"" for us; I had a good friend from Nagasaki, Japan watch the first film and he HAD to have subtitles on...surprising....

Anyway, to summarize, the video quality is superb, the audio quality is what it is (original 2.0 stero mix, not much can be done with that....) and I am very happy with this Lone Wolf and Cub collection.

2398617,4,B000AYNFVC,"I first saw the ""Sword of Vengeance"" series in the 1970's at the Toho La Brea Theater in Los Angeles. Very Impressive. Especially the films directed by Kenji Misumi, one of the greatest of ""chambara"" directors in the history of Japanese film. The ""Sword of Vengeance"" films are more properly chambara, sword fighting films, than samurai, or period films: ""Jidai-geki"". First a series of manga comics, then these films, then a Japanese TV series, starring Kinnosuke Nakamura as Itto Ogami. Nakamura was THE chambara star at Tohei Studios in the 1950's and early 60's. And I see that DVD's of that TV series are also available from Amazon. Itto Ogami's archenemy is Jubei Yagyu, of the Yagyu clan of Ken-jutsu masters.

Jubei Yagyu is depicted in the movies as an old man, by an actor in very bad old man makeup, when Ogami finally kills him. The historical Jubei Yagyu was blind in one eye, like the movie version, but...the real Jubei Yagyu died at the age of 43!

2398635,5,B000AYNFVC,"This ""Lone Wolf and Cub Complete Series"" release from Animeigo is one of the best arguments for changing over to Blu Ray that I have ever seen. It isn't that it is stuffed full of extra features and funky junk that you will look at once and then never again--it's how all six films in the series have been put on two disks, then packed into a single, slim box.

Seriously, I panicked a little when I got this in the mail. I figured something was wrong, that maybe they had only sent me the first flick instead of the complete series. I couldn't believe it until I popped the disk in my player; This set is actually all six films--with the best quality releases ever seen--packed efficiently into a tiny little package. As someone who is a bit of a film junky, and whose house is overflowing with giant, six film box sets, I really appreciate the space. I want to convert everything I own to little packages like this.

That's the packaging; now how are the films? Obviously, the Lone Wolf and Cub series is a bonafide classic. Adapted from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-series/dp/1569715025/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic series</a>&nbsp;by Koike Kazuo and Kojima Goseki, ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" may be one of the first comic-to-film adaptations to really nail it. No surprise since Koike also wrote the screenplays. Produced Katsu Shintaro--flush from his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zatoichi/dp/B00073K7JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zatoichi</a>&nbsp;fame--who hired his brother Wakayama Tomisaburo as the assassin Ogami Itto, Some might see a bit of nepotism there; tubby, middle-aged Wakayama is hardly anyone's idea of a dashing action hero. But Wakayama is well known as being one of the best true swordsmen to make a career as an actor. Most actor's just faked it. With Wakayama, you are getting something closer to the real deal.

But that is about where reality ends. Lone Wolf and Cub are what I think of as ""Cinematic Samurai."" Far from the considered humanism of Kurosawa or the socio-political commentary of Kobayashi, these flicks are full-on over-the-top ultra-violent unapologetic male power fantasies. They eschew any form of realism. Blood doesn't trickle from a wound, it bursts forward like a geyser, and with enough blood to paint a house red. Swords can be thrown like darts and never miss their mark. People don't stand still and fight, they leap and bound with superhuman vigor. And one man can cut down an army, so long as they aren't named characters. These are the kind of flicks that inspired Tarantino and Frank Miller. They are a hell of a lot of fun.

The six films are:

Sword of Vengence - 1972 - Any movie that starts out with the beheading of a 3-year old child is making a statement as to where it stands. If you can't get by that scene, best to just pop the disk out and never watch the series again. The first ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" flick is a solemn, gloomy affair. Ogami Itto and his child Daigo are on the run for a crime they didn't commit, and wind up with a troop of mountain bandits who want to sport with the father and son before killing them.

Baby Cart at the River Styx - 1972 - The unquestioned best film in the series. Elite squads of female assassins, the three Lords of Death, and--best of all--Daigo gets into the action. When that cherubic little face hits a button on the baby cart and a big spear comes shooting out, you know this series has leapt beyond it's humble beginnings an into something spectacular.

Baby Cart to Hades - 1972 - Ruminations on the Way of the Warrior and a concealed Gatling gun are the memorable moments of the third Lone Wolf and Cub flick. There is a danger of escalation, of films going so over-the-top that they move into parody, but the fine balance is still maintained no matter how wild the action gets.

Baby Cart in Peril - 1972 - Daigo is getting a little too big for his famous baby cart in this film, and decides to head out for some adventures on his own. Meanwhile,  Ogami is engaged in a battle with the beautiful--and perpetually topless--female assassin Oyuki.  Nice showdown in this film, with no easy win for Ogami.

Baby Cart in the Land of Demons - 1973 - Name aside, the baby cart is mostly gone now as Ogami and Daigo head out on their separate adventures.  Ogami proves he is no hero as he takes on the assassination of a young girl fated to succeed the local daimyo.

White Heaven in Hell - 1974 -  The last film in the series takes some new twists and turns, including supernatural elements and a final showdown with Ogami's longtime enemy who has pursued him throughout the series.  The famous baby cart returns with a vengeance, and Ogami manages to slaughter an entire army.  He pulls off 150 on-screen kills in this film, the most of any individual character in a movie.",1348531200,10,4881,4.813620071684587

The story is compelling. The swordplay wicked, and the support actors mostly pretty good too.

This is a series you will watch over and over, appreciating it for different things each time.

2398638,5,B000AYNFVC,"I thankfully stumbled upon the ""Lone Wolf & Cub"" movie series not too long ago after rediscovering the ""Zatoichi"" series via their DVD releases.

(A little back-history)
As a teenager, my friends & I used to watch movies at The State, an old pre-WWII movie theatre. We had watched & enjoyed several of the great ""spaghetti"" westerns movies there - the ""Fistful"", ""Magnificent Seven"" & ""Nobody"" movies to name a few. What interested us most was that those movies had such interestingly enigmatic and, for lack of a better term, bad-assed characters portrayed by actors like Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, & Terrence Hill. Needless to say, we were all hooked on those types of movies. We all wanted to be THAT guy!

After being closed for quite a few years, the old State re-opened as an Asian cinema. By then, that old theatre was about as run down as they can get but I tell you it was our paradise(obvious pun). We loved that place. There we were introduced to the Kung Fu & Samurai genres of cinema by movies such as ""Zatoichi"", ""Yojimbo"", ""Master Killer"" & ""Drunken Master"" among many others. Unfortunately, there are many great movies we saw at The State that I cannot remember the title of and/or still cannot find to this day.

However, in that search I found this awesome series and hope you find them as I have - completely entertaining. In fact, I chose this series as my first movie review because I believe it has all the elements found in the others that made them so great.

Tomasaburo Wakayama as Ogami Itto stands out as being every bit the nomadic bad-ass that Eastwood portrays in the ""man with no name"" movies. I realized very quickly into the first movie that same feeling I'd had before - I want to be THAT guy! Itto's young son, Daigoro, is a brave & participating partner in his father's pursuit of vengeance as they travel like ""demons"" on the path between Heaven and Hell.

I don't want to give any spoilers as I feel doing so ruins the whole experience of watching great movies like these for the first time - an experience I've frequently wished I could get back and therefore something I'd hate to take away from anyone. All I'll say about this series is that I found the movies action-packed, culturally interesting, touchingly sensitive & magnificently triumphant though I also found them at times to be hideously gory, gratuitously sexual & horrifically sinister. The best description I can give of the movies would be to say that they are severely ""human"" because they portray some of the most kindest & noblest deeds of humanity yet some of its most horribly terrifying ones, too.

Finally, there are a few scenes where some might say, ""Yeah right, that's impossible"" or ""Did they really need to show that?"" Believe me, I understand, however it took absolutely no effort to quickly remember that this is a mythical story of an utterly determined man's quest for vengeance - limitations, circumstances & consequences are irrelevant.

It is my sincere hope that you will find these movies as interesting & entertaining as I have. So please, pop some popcorn, grab some gummy bears, pour a cold one with some friends or by yourself & enjoy.

PS - I do not recommend buying the newer ""Shogun Assassin"" movies as they merely ""cut & paste"" the same video material from this series with the progression of events significantly altered from their original edit & intention. I own both series on DVD and never watch the newer ones. It appears the ""Shogun Assassin"" series were created because its makers tried to ""westernize"" the original series for international sale (the ""Lone Wolf & Cub"" films were banned in many countries for several years therefore changing their names/structures may have been a necessity). In my opinion, the changes unfortunately complicated the plot considerably, caused very ""clunky"" scene transitions, and ultimately presents a cheap imitation of the original series similar in many ways to the post-mortem Bruce Lee movies.",1296172800,5,3977,4.804093567251462
2398639,5,B000AYNFVC,"This box is a must-have for anyone with an interest in martial arts and samurai action. All six movies can be seen individually, but for the best experience, I would recommend viewing them in order.

Itto Ogami, the main character is arguably the coolest person ever in movies. He was the shogunates assassin, responsible for helping people who commit seppuku (ritual suicide by slicing open the gut) die a less painful death, by decapitating them.

Ogami is a true master of sword fighting as well as fighting in general. He pushes around a baby cart containing his only son (about 3-4 years of age) along with an arsenal of hidden weapons. I will not reveal just how cool the cart really is, but trust me, it is cool.

The red thread in the movies is revenge. Ogami wants to revenge his wife's and servant's deaths and clean his clan name by killing the evil Yagyu clan members lead by Retsudu. They don't give up easily and Ogami has to fight hordes of Yagyu people as well as an assorted group of other persons wanting to kill him.

The results are quite terrible considering the fact that many scenes obviously lack one of the duelists missing from the frame which totally disturbs the viewer and spoils the atmosphere. If you're willing to truely enjoy the movies to their maximum entertainment potentials, I would recommend buying the Japanese issued versions that should have the films in their original ratios though they cost tons more and come in different region codes.

2398648,5,B000AYNFVC,"Even though my first experience of the LONE WOLF AND CUB story was by seeing the American-dubbed SHOGUN ASSASSIN, the story fascinated me.  Later on, I learned of the broadcast-TV series (called on that particular NIPPON TV station THE FUGITIVE SAMURAI) and then the actual manga ... and I was forever hooked!

I particularly love this particular two-DVD set (containing the three-part conclusion to the first season) because it contains one of the best episodes of the entire series, DAIGORO'S SONG.  This episode, the second part of the first season finale, focuses entirely on little Daigoro after he has been separated from his father after a fight with their arch-enemy Yagyu Retsudo and his men and his search to find his father again.  I'm glad that Daigoro becomes the main character for a while; while he never says very much throughout his tenure as Daigoro, Katzutaka Nishikawa (who played Daigoro for the first two seasons) has such an expressive face and captures the character so well (far better than Takumi Sat, who took over the part in the third and final season) he easily rivals Akihiro Tomikawa (who played Daigoro in the Wayakama Tomisaburo LONE WOLF films). DAIGORO'S SONG also has the particularly beautiful and haunting song sung by a children's chorus (which I don't believe could be equalled if ever translated into English lyrics).",1238457600,,1359,5.026666666666666

2398651,4,B000AYNFVC,"I'm not the most impartial critic: in the early seventies, I was serving in the Navy, stationed in Japan.  I was trying to learn to speak Japanese and watched a lot of Japanese television to try to get the pronunciation right.  At the time, Kosure Ogami was a big hit TV series there.  I became addicted.  Withdrawal came when I rotated back to the 'States.

I knew they had made a movie based on the TV series, poorly overdubbed in English and released in this country as ""Lightning Swords of Death"".  I'd seen it in a theater, and been disappointed (the overdubbing, as I said, was not very good).

A few weeks ago, a friend and I were discussing martial arts movies and it got me to thinking.  I Googled ""Lightning Swords of Death"" and wound up on Amazon, looking at not just one, but a box set of SIX Kosure Ogami films, which I promptly bought.

I've since watched all six.  Ogami Itto is still the best swordsman in Japan.  Daigoro is still a sharp kid.  The (obviously) fake blood still flows like water - special effects were never the series' strong suite.  But the poor English overdubs have been replaced with English subtitles - the original Japanese soundtrack is intact.  It was taken from really good prints - the video and audio quality are excellent.

Is this great cinematic art?  No.  But it is an interesting story, fairly-well acted, with some of the best-choreographed swordplay ever filmed.  I think I got my money's worth and more.",1217548800,3,1455,4.573643410852713

2398653,5,B000AYNFVC,"""Lone Wolf and Cub"" is the pinnacle of Asian grindhouse cinema and the most action-packed and downright cool series of samurai films ever made. The violence is brutal, the sex (both forced and consensual) is plentiful, the characters are memorable, and there is a lot of subtle humor and beautiful Japanese culture to be enjoyed as well.  I cannot recommend these six films enough.

Beginning as the Shogun's personal executioner, our anti-hero Ogami Itto is framed by the jealous and ambitious Yagyu clan's shadow ops; his wife murdered in the process.  In his rage, Itto takes his young son, Daigoro, and declares them to be demons, apart from the world of men to live as assassins for hire.  His primary target: the head of the Shadow Yagyus, a decrepit old warrior known as Retsudo.  Along the way he encounters hidden ninja and other Yagyu warriors, deadly kunoichi, clan heads in need of his services, friendly villagers, prostitutes, yakuza, Retsudo's skilled offspring, and many more, most of whom will either be diced up by his sword, or by his enemies'.  Thankfully, Lone Wolf and Cub are more than ready for whatever comes their way.  Ogami Itto pushes his son around in a modified baby cart that is packed full of hidden surprises for anyone who wishes to take his head.  And nobody is his equal with a sword.  Nobody.  Amusingly, Daigoro manages to rack up a little body count of his own and embarks on his own little adventures from time to time too.

The first film ""Sword of Vengeance"" focuses on Ogami Itto's first clashes with the Shadow Yagyu clan; playing a bloody game of chess as the disgraced samurai embarks upon his demon's journey by outwitting Retsudo and escaping to the open road.  ""Baby Cart at the River Styx"" is my favorite film of the series and features a deadly band of lady shinobi (kunoichi), and a mission which pits Lone Wolf and Cub against a trio of skilled and honorable warriors with brutal weapons who have been hired to protect his target.  ""Baby Cart to Hades"" (best title ever!) has Itto sacrificing his own body to protect a lowly prostitute in need and features one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed as our (anti)hero single-handedly battles an entire force of Yagyu troopers and kills ever last one.  Awesome. ""Baby Cart in Peril"" features a heroic female samurai with tattoos who fights topless (for distraction, see?).  In order to retrieve the information vital to his mission in ""Baby Cart in the Land of Demons"" Lone Wolf and Cub must past the deadly tests put forth by five of the clans retainers who can appear anywhere at any time.  Lastly ""White Heaven in Hell"" pits Ogami Itto and son against a Yagyu clan desperate to finally avenge their shame by ending their lives. Lord Retsudo orders every person who helps or even speaks to them to be put to death.  As Itto flees civilization into the frozen mountains, Retsudo sends his supernaturally-powered ninja to stalk him while the remainder of the clan's army is brought up for the end game.  All of these films are must-sees for martial-arts and action fans.

The bonus features include many trailers, particularly for Zatoichi films (Shintaro Katsu -who played the legendary blind swordsman- produced the first three films and cast this brother, Tomisaburo Wakayama, as Ogami Itto).  Each disc also features extensive and informative notes about Japanese history and culture to help put some of the events in the films in perspective.  Good stuff.

If you're looking for unrelenting action, brutal gore, a protagonist who is an unstoppable bada$#, and a story that has coolness around every corner then this is a series you must look into.  It's a great place to start if you're looking to get into samurai films and this set belongs in the DVD library of all professing to be fans of the genre.

Even if you don't, if you don't mind the huge amounts of violence, they are great movies.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the main stars of the series are Ogami Itto and his son Daigoro.  The classic anti-hero who will sometimes do bad things (in western eyes) in a noble fashion.  The incredible bond between father and son, of which throughout the entire series is almost completely unspoken.  I have to say that I like Daigoro the most, he's just one tough kid! (I named my dog Daigoro)
One thing that I can mention that I noticed hasn't been mention yet, is that each dvd had extensive liner notes, and if you take the time to read will give you a much better understanding of the period and certain scenes in the movies i.e. the significance of a big radish etc...
The only thing else I can say is that there is no 'kung-fu' in these movies... perhaps the other reviewers meant it is the type of movie you would see on 'kung-fu theatre'...",1188345600,3,1236,4.5656108597285066
2398655,5,B000AYNFVC,"This is the best series of films that I have ever seen in my whole life... and I watch TONS of movies.  The plot can be a bit disjointed at times, and certain films are better than others, but there really is nothing bad about any of these films.

The violence causes emotion to be felt, and the bond between father and son is as strong as can be, even though very few words are said between the two.  Even though there is a massive amount of killing in the series, death is never glamorized and cheapened... there is always substance behind it.  The ""death blow"" that occurs in each of the main one on one duels is always thought provoking, and has symbolic meaning.  When Ogami Itto takes another ronin's life, the fallen samurai is always happy because they got the opportunity to die at the hand of the very best, and maintain their integrity in the process.

The cinematography is beautiful in all of these films,  The acting is superb, and the plot is amazing.  If you are a movie buff and you haven't seen these films before, do yourself a favor and watch all of them.  If you are a samurai film fan and have never seen this series, don't admit it to anyone and just watch these as soon as possible... you owe it to yourself!!!",1184803200,2,1234,4.3304347826086955
