8490778,5,B00000JX38,"If you live in earthquake country, check out this terrific video by the L. A. F. D. (""Surviving The Big One"").  It is jam-packed with VALID ways to stay safe wherever you are:  in the mall, at the movies, at the ball game, on the highway, at work, etc. (and, of course, at home). All my out-of-town guests watch it and are mesmerized!

KCET updated it after the Northridge quake, but unfortunately, some of the original was cut to keep the running time to only 90 minutes.  The 1989 version is the original.",1096416000,3,507,4.419354838709677
