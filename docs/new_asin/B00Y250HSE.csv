8717409,5,B00Y250HSE,This is one of my all time favorites and I am thrilled to finally own it. A special coming-of-age story. Her adjustments to college life after being a big fish in a high school pond are heartbreaking. I had forgotten about the Springsteen music which just caps it all with atmosphere and authenticity.,1474502400,2,301,4.69811320754717

8717411,5,B00Y250HSE,"This is a great film from a great director - John Sayles. Jill is the smart, popular Jewish girl at her school and Sheik is the bad boy with a weird anachronistic streak in his worship of Frank Sinatra (in the mid-60's). It's got a raw, gritty feeling that you don't get from the usual 80's teen romances. It's got a realistic plot and avoids all the cliche's. I love this movie.",1462320000,,379,4.277777777777778

8717413,5,B00Y250HSE,One of my all-time favorite 80's movies. Vincent Spano just kills it in this movie. Excited to get it on Blu Ray!!,1455148800,,114,4.2272727272727275
