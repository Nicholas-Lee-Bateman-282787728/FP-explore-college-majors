2667919,5,B000JBXY44,"When this DVD collection lands on my multi-media shelf, it will displace all others as being my favorite DVD title I won.  Move over Lord Of The Rings SE and Star Wars Trilogy, there's a new sheriff in town!

I exaggerate, but only slightly.

I think its important to note that you don't have to have played the game or have any kind of experience or even knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons to enjoy the cartoon series.  Outside of the unparalleled art and voice talent, it really was the stories that endure.  The cartoon series explores the human spirit, and all that it embodies during the kids fantastic trek through a magical realm.

Don't play the game Dungeons and Dragons?  Throw the extra material in the garbage - the cartoon series alone is a steal at this price.",1161302400,9,773,4.557971014492754
2667920,5,B000JBXY44,"For the uninitiated, this series tells the tale of six kids who, after riding the Dungeons & Dragons rollercoaster, mysteriously get sucked into its fantasy world. There, each of them gains magical talents and abilities, all the better to survive their time in the Realm. The bow-shooting ranger, the acrobat, the thief, the cavalier, the wizard, and the boy-barbarian are soon joined by a baby unicorn, and tutored by the mysterious Dungeon Master. Opposing them is the evil sorcerer Venger, as well as various monsters and entities all intent on keeping the kids from getting back home. This was one of CBS' most popular animated series, airing for 27 episodes from 1983-1986, and again in the '90s on the Fox Kids network as reruns. Created by the legendary Marvel Productions, the series was based on the popular TSR role-playing game created in 1974, which spawned an entire industry.  The complete animated series was released on DVD in 2006 by BCI Eclipse and again in 2009 by Mill Creek Entertainment.  Since both releases are vastly different, I will try to outline the differences between both.

In 2006,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeons-Dragons-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B000JBXY44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeons & Dragons- The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;was released in a re-mastered 5-disc boxed set loaded with extras by BCI Eclipse.  The only negative was that certain episodes had some of its original music replaced.  This set is now out-of-print and can only be bought from private sellers since BCI closed down in 2008.  Here are the special features on this set;

*All-new half hour documentary, 'Entering the Realm of Dungeons & Dragons' featuring interviews with the show's production team, writers, animators, and network executives
*Two commentary tracks for episodes 'Night of No Tomorrow' & 'The Dragon's Graveyard' with producer Bob Richardson, story editor/ voice director Hank Saroyan, writers Mark Evanier & Michael Reaves, and CBS executives Ted Field II & Judy Price
*Radio show-style presentation of the unaired final episode 'Requiem' featuring select original voice cast members
*Full length animated storyboard with interactive episode comparison for Episode #16 'The Girl Who Dreamed Of Tomorrow'
*'Choose Your Own Adventure' DVD Game & 'Uni's Fun Facts' Trivia
*50 characters, creatures & artifacts profiles with bios, images & clips, plus extensive gallery of original model sheets & memorabilia
*Short live-action film by fan Sean Kennedy
*Alternate and rare footage plus hidden easter eggs
*DVD-ROM features including scripts for multiple episodes (including the un-produced series finale script), complete storyboards and the original series bible
*Episode guide booklet with show's synopsis, writers and original air dates
*Official 'Dungeons & Dragons' hard-cover game supplement created exclusively by Wizards of the Coast featuring 32 pages of character profiles and stat blocks. The adventure is a prelude to the episode 'The Dragon's Graveyard' and is designed to bridge the game and the animated TV series. The characters and world within the animated series are now playable with the traditional RPG game.

In 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeons-Dragons-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B002DH20Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeons & Dragons: The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;as a bare bones 3-disc set with none of the special features.  However, the original music for all of the episodes was restored for this release.  The BCI release is definitely aimed at the hardcore fans while the Mill Creek release is better suited for the casual, cost conscious fans.  Of course, diehard fans will probably want to pick up both complete series releases given they each has pros and cons.  As for the show, it is unfortunate that sagging ratings led to its premature cancellation in 1986.  But thanks to these DVD releases, fans can relive all these great adventures anytime they want!",1160870400,229,4092,5.811352253756261

siblings during ordinary times, but when peril threatened, out came their powerful weapons!

this series was deemed ""inappropriate"" by some very religious viewers and the series was
discontinued before the finale.. I recommend that anyone who is a fan of Fantasy/Sci-Fi buy
 this animated series. You can even see the finale that was written (but never animated except later in stills)

2667951,2,B000JBXY44,"I'm a big gamer, but was never a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, nor the whole D&D phenomena that took place in the 70s and 80s.  I, in fact, disliked a lot of it.  So keep that in mind as I write this review.

First off ""original"" D&D, in its raw form, as about medieval era European ""warrior"" classes (not just men at arms, but bandits, those with magical or divine talents, even ""thievery"" like skills) confronting a world populated with creatures from European folklore and myth with sword, shield and the occasional magic missile.

Okay, fine, but what does that have to do with this cartoon?  It has to do with the cartoon because the cartoon was bloodless ""clever""-battle-wit oriented where the character defeat their enemies and other foes through out thinking them, and never battling them directly.  The archer/thief never kills a single enemy with his magical bow, ditto with the dude carrying the club, and the ""dungeon master"" is an actual character in this world when in game terms he's just guy administering the adventure.

I bring this up because this was a period BEFORE school shootings by outcasts became  a popular trend in media reporting (I say that because if you look at the actual statistic of school shootings, you'll probably find that most of them are drug-gang related, and not the mass killing episodes that we've come to be familiar with).  This is important because in Japan, when this show was first being aired, extreme violence was shown in cartoons meant for young and old alike.  Guys getting blown away in all sorts of ways by guns, or sliced up by samurai swords or other deadly implements.  And yet the crime rate in Japan, and specifically violent crime, was (and is) almost non-existent.

""But what does that have to do with this cartoon?!""  It has everything to do with it, because the social psychologists at the time were trying to set examples for the US youth by showing D&D kids that you didn't need to kill to overcome the opposition.  And yet school fights in US schools were huge when this show aired, even among D&D fans.

Not only was the show giving a non-violent message when the actual game was ALL ABOUT violence, killing and looting mythical creatures and animals, and yet school violence was becoming a huge problem.

This show, in a word, is dumb.  It was created by nervous, condescending, jerks who thought they knew better than you and me of not only what the American public needed, but what they believed motivated violence and how to salve it.

The massive explosion of extremely violent computer games has shown that an outlet for our more basic violent programming is what was needed.  And that is reflected in the Japanese model where children from the earliest days of anime were exposed to all kinds of violence, and how that society, and similar Asian societies that consume similar media, do not have the juvenile crime problem we experience in the USA.

The show specifically; the characters were idiotic, the premise of the show was just as vapid and didn't show real adventurers doing what you do in D&D; explore historically innacturate massive underground complexes, and keep the action idiotically saccharine and G-Rated.  There was also a social agenda in showing the mixing of different social circles acting in unison and as friends.  Hmm, well, okay, that's not a bad message.  In fact, it's probably a fairly healthy one, but again it completely missed the mark.  I mean, how many African American females went out and played D&D by virtue of this show?  I'm guessing not many, if any at all.

On top of that the animation was exceptionally poor, and oddly enough looked like it was done in some off shore studio based out of either Japan or South Korea.  But that's actually nitpicking, because a lot of cartoons at the time had the same kind of production values.

The sound effects, from what I recall were also recycled fare from other animated children's venues airing at that time and from the previous two decades; the 1960s and 1970s.

I don't know, like I say, I'm not a big D&D fan in the first place.  The few sessions I played, to me, were fun enough, but there was such a mish mash of throwing together classic and medieval era cultures, that the mix just lost the flavor of historic mythology.  Example; a marine I knew said he had a thief character who trained in some town/castle that was akin to a European medieval society, who then became a ""magic user"", who then became a ninja ... even though in the D&D proper setting, there is no Japan.  Huh.  And even there was a Greyhawk Japan equivalent, then any European, in particular a Lincoln Green ""robin hood"" type with a bow and staff, would probably have been killed outright.

So, not only did I not like the game, and what it was becoming, but I even more disliked a continued bastardization of traditional mythos, and no proper exploration of actual historic myths.

In other words I wondered why there weren't more Disney like productions with Snow White like production values, but that also explored places like medieval Japan, or medieval Africa, or meso-America, or Eurasia Russia, and instead we were getting a bastardization of not only classic myths, but a real condescension of what the social architects believed were healthy messages to the American youth (US and Canada).

A better show would have been about a band of mostly white characters encountering and learning from other cultures.  But that's not what we got.  And, for what it's worth, D&D does have a ""violent"" element in their player base.  It's not all well meaning polite ""nerds"" who are overweight or emaciated.  There are some unruly gamers in the D&D realm who could have benefitted from what I think would have been a better show, and who probably scoffed at this cartoon for different reasons (though akin) to what I've listed.

The show is dumb, the characters are dumb, the producers were and are condescending beyond belief, and overall, unless you're a very young viewer in the 2 to 5 age bracket, I can't imagine anyone honestly being interested in this on any level whatsoever.

If you've never seen it, maybe borrow a copy from a friend or the library, then decide whether or not you want to splurge on a copy.

Either way, don't say I didn't warn you.

2668013,5,B000JBXY44,"In the early 80's a cartoon aired depicting the misadventures of a group of kids who get stuck in the Realm of Dungeons and Dragons. The setup was simple, and was in the opening credits of every season 1 episode: six kids get on an amusement park ride which carries them into another dimension. They wind up in a fantasy world with weapons of power and the Dungeon Master as their guide (of sorts). Each kid had a different archetype. Hank the Ranger was the leader and carried a magic bow with energy arrows. Sheila the Theif had an invisibility cloak, and her little brother Bobby the Barbarian had a club that could create earthquakes. Diana the Acrobat had an indestructible bo staff that could change lengths and reform at will, Presto the Magician had a magic hat that he could pull all sorts of things out of, including modern conveniences (though he did not always get precisely what he asked for), and Eric the Cavalier had a shield that could repel anything and create temporary particle barriers. Dungeon Master would start every episode giving them a riddle and sending them on a quest, kind of like in the game, except in this case the kids were not locals. They were 'playing' to get back home. Every quest the Dungeon Master sent them on supposedly led to a portal back to 1980's Earth, but they always either missed it by thismuch, or they had some ethical reason why they had to turn back. This show actually managed to sneak some fairly realistic ethical dilemmas past the censors who were only interested in morality plays, which enriched the viewing experience of the show. That doesn't make it any less of an 80's show, but it does make it better than average and worth a view if you like fantasy animesque shows. There is some recognizable voice talent on this show, especially if you're familiar with 70's and 80's TV. Hank was played by Willie Aames, better known for the sitcom Eight is Enough. Eric was played by Don Most of Happy Days. Presto was played by Adam Rich, also known for Eight is Enough, and I got to hand it to that actor, he was really convincing at depicting Presto at the age of a guy whose voice is breaking. Katie Leigh, the voice of Alex from Totally Spies, played Sheila. Diana's voice actress, Tonia Gayle Smith, was nominated for a Youth in Film Award for her work on this series. And of course one mustn't forget Peter Cullen of Transformers fame playing the Big Bad, Venger.

The animation is very good compared to a lot of similarly themed series from the same era. This series was story-boarded in detail by the Western show-runners, and then animated by Japanese studio Toei. It's nowhere near the crisp lines of 2D computer animation coming out nowadays, but it had some of the most beautiful chiaroscuro I've ever seen in a Saturday morning cartoon. As far as the audio it had a great cast and excellent score, but the creature sound effects could be unintentionally hilarious at times. Uni the baby unicorn sounded like a goat, Venger's steed Nightmare sounded like an old man coughing, and just about every monster the kids encountered pretty much just went ""blaarrgghh!"" Even the robots. But that doesn't really detract from overall enjoyment of the show. YMMV on Uni.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there are two editions of the complete series on DVD that you could be getting here. Personally, I think it's apples and oranges but I'm not in the least bit disappointed with the version I got (the Millcreek version). If you get the Millcreek set, you get all the original soundtrack synced up to the episodes correctly. It is a very good orchestral soundtrack, so I don't blame the audiophiles for recommending the Millcreek version. If you get the BCI version, you'll get a radio show rendition of the last episode, which never made it into production. I've read a transcript of it, and I can tell you that it would have been a very good episode and it's a shame it never aired. From what I've heard neither DVD set has the original season 2 intro (Millcreek definitely doesn't), so you're not missing anything there either way.",1483228800,3,4095,4.654696132596685

2668028,5,B000JBXY44,"Dungeons & Dragons is a terrific fantasy adventure cartoon series based on the RPG of the same name. The show is American, but it is beautifully drawn by the Japanese animation company called ''Toei Animation''.

The show is about 6 kids who are magically transported into the fantasy world of Dungeons & Dragons. The kids are then given classes by the Dungeon Master. Hank becomes a Ranger, Bobby becomes a Barbarian, Presto becomes a Magician, Sheila becomes a Thief, Eric becomes a Cavalier, and Diana becomes an Acrobat. The main villain is an evil wizard called Venger who wants to take the children's magic weapons in order to rule the realm.

In each episode, the kids must explore dungeons, and battle demons, orcs, dragons, as well as Venger himself in order to try to find a way back home. Dungeon Master often appears and gives the kids advice to help them, as well as inspiration when they feel they can't go on.

This show is SO good. I love absolutely everything about it. It has lovable characters, a cool villain, gorgeous animation, and good voice acting. It's action packed and filled with awesome magic filled battle scenes. It's cool, fun, beautiful, scary, and funny. It really feels like you're watching an RPG.

If you love video games like Breath Of Fire, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Phantasy Star, then you'll love this wonderful 80's cartoon series. I highly recommend it. It's one of my favorite cartoon shows of all time.",1479513600,8,1454,4.804

2668070,3,B000JBXY44,"There are two reasons I gave this three stars:  One, when I started looking at this item, I added it to my cart at a price of $7.98. By the time I went to check out 20 minutes later, I got a notification from Amazon that the price had gone up to $12.98.  As I write this review, the price is now down to $8.15. That's highway robbery and it shouldn't be allowed here. Two, in the second season, the introduction to the show changed to where the group was escaping a dungeon at night, and a big red dragon busts out of a castle across a drawbridge and Cavalier yells, ""Dungeon Master, help!"" Then Venger's image expands into the night sky as he says. ""There is no escape from the realm of Dungeons & Dragons!""
It seems whoever compiled this DVD failed to include that new intro and uses the Season 1 intro for every episode.",1469145600,,823,4.235668789808917

2668270,3,B000JBXY44,"TSR - Dungeons and Dragons is the FATHER of World of Warcraft, and every adventure game.
D&D invented Hit-Points, the very foundation of all combat games, and was played with paper and pencil and imagination.  Now computers do the math and GPUs provide the visualization - but nothing beats reading great stories
written by TSR AD&D and their famous books such as Deities and Demigods, and Monster Manual.

This cartoon is kinda based upon D&D with random kids sucked into the D&D universe.
The cartoon is a budget production, the DVD transfer is of fair quality, but as a collector's item,
it is well worth adding to your D&D / AD&D collection.",1423958400,,645,4.75

2668293,3,B000JBXY44,"This is basically exactly what it says it is--a collection of the 23 animated episodes from the mid-80s Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.

My brother and I didn't get to watch this series a WHOLE lot (as I recall it was on opposite Blackstar where we lived) but caught it on occasion.  I remember at the time that the continued overarching storyline--the kids trying to get home, the Dungeon Master pointing them at something and then for SOME WEIRD REASON they couldn't use it/do it/had to destroy it--seemed pretty odd to me.  Surely ought of ALL THOSE WAYS they discovered to get back home at least ONE would have worked out?  It was quite clear to me that the Dungeon Master was deliberately using them to DESTROY these various routes home.

Binge-watching it here after finally picking it up just drove that home to me again, though I admit I did go into it with that bias remembered.  Towards the end of the series the stories were less ""the possible way home this week"" and more ""well THAT way didn't work and oh my goodness what is going on here?!?"", but I still had the same feeling.

Anyway it's a good enough series and quite enjoyable to see it again.  Recommended for any fan of the better 80s cartoons and/or collectors of fantasy-themed animation",1420070400,,1257,4.605381165919282

2668339,5,B000JBXY44,"I recalled several episodes from my childhood and bought the BCI Eclipse release of this collection of cartoons.  I loved it thirty years ago (!), and I love it now.  The kids are great - complete with cracking voices, tantrums, squabbling, and teasing.

I somewhat disagree with the ages assigned to the characters: according to the series bible, Hank is the oldest at 15 years old, which seems awfully young.  In one episode, Hank says that Diana won the states gymnastics tournament for the last two years, so maybe she is a high school junior in the spring semester, yet to win the gold medal for the third time.  Hank and Eric would be in the same grade (maybe 17 years old), Sheila a sophomore, and Presto a freshman.  As for Bobby, one episode flatly states that he's almost ten years old.

After watching these DVDs repeatedly, I would assign a new episode order to track character development and keep plot elements in sync.  Maybe I'm being too obsessive.  Maybe.

Great bonus features including a radio play of the final episode they never made. The packaging and presentation are top notch and you'd be surprised at how well the series has held up. You'll actually find yourself enjoying these episodes outside of just reliving the nostalgia and you might even be surprised  at how mature a few of the episodes were. ""The Dragons Graveyard"" is perhaps one of the most moving episodes with the kids being forced to make the decision to kill their enemy in order to get back home which is very sophisticated narrative not normally expected in cartoons of this era. The behind the scenes documentary is fantastic as well as we come to learn how the show came to be, who the players were behind the scenes along with interviews with several of the writers and many interesting tidbits and funny anecdotes.

2668439,5,B000JBXY44,For years I wanted to own this series which is quite literally my favorite cartoon as a child.  The series came out in 2006 and was worth $120 and I saw some units go for $180.  I was tempted to buy it back then but $120 bucks were a little steep for me back then.  Then I found out that this was availble for $5 and had ALL OF THE ORIGINAL MUSICAL SCORES as they were in the episodes upon originally airing.  This millcreek entertainment series at $5 was all that I had ever asked for. THANK YOU.,1394323200,,497,4.040816326530612

It has Mark Evanier and Paul Dini writing, which is a plus, as Im a fan of both of their respective work in comics and film. Im really enjoying this even if the first monster they encounter is Tiamat and they do defeat Lloth in like three seconds with no magic, but hey, Im loving it.

2668471,5,B000JBXY44,"You know you're getting old when you say ""____ was MUCH better back in MY day!""
But the world must be screwed up when ""back in the old days"" refers to the 1980s.  That was only 5, 10?, 20...?

Ok, so it was 30 years ago.  But this was excellent cartoon, even by 2010s standards.  That is if you like strong heroic teenaged protagonists fighting against entities and creatures bent on their destruction while searching for their way back home  -- the whole good vs evil is very passe for some folks. But it makes for very entertaining animation.  And what better way to hook a young audience than to start the first 5 minutes of nearly every show with the good guys running for their lives?

I took Red Demon's suggestion, and got this Mill Creek Entertainment edition.  I didn't think the music would matter so much, but that reviewer is correct -- stick with the original.  Plus this version does have 27, as opposed to less than 10 at a more expensive price.

All in all, this was the most satisfying DVDs I'd watched in a few month, and not just for the nostalgia factor.  Adventureous and honorable adolescence thrown together in a hostile environment that work together to save themselves and others  -- sWeeT!

The ONLY thing I wish I could have seen was an episode where they finally reach their goal.  But that is the fault of the show producers, not the DVD set.

2668550,3,B000JBXY44,"I've never played the game, but from what I've seen, it's the kind of thing that I'd be into. Being a lover of everything 80s, I decided to pick this up. Watched the first disc so far, and....it's alright. The storyline is kind of weak, even for a 1980s cartoon, but it's still pretty fun to watch. I picked this set, and not the out of print BCI set, because I didn't really remember the show from when I was a kid and the BCI set didn't really have any amazing extras. The one thing that this version has over the BCI set, other than being FAR cheaper, is that it has the original music. Whereas the BCI set had replacement music in at least one of the episodes. The quality of the animation is stellar, especially for an 80s cartoon.

Like I said, the stories in the show are pretty weak. If you like fantasy 80s cartoons, I think I'd stick with stuff like He-man, She-Ra, Defenders Of The Earth, Thundercats, and even JEM. The vibe will be sort of the same and the stories in those shows are much better and, at times, deeper and more involved.",1380067200,,1048,4.266331658291457

This series is one of the reasons I became a writer because it so effortlessly brought you into the world of D&D--so much so you could see the world beyond that which was shown on the show...if that makes sense.

And the ridiculous price that it often sells for makes this an easy buy.",1378425600,,402,4.4324324324324325
2668583,4,B000JBXY44,"I remember watching this series on television, some of the episodes at least. I can remember wondering why they didn't make more of them.

2668584,3,B000JBXY44,"I originally bought this mostly because it was cheap & that I was hoping to relive my childhood days from when they actually used to have descent Saturday morning cartoons. Dungeons & Dragons aired originally on CBS in 1985. It was about 6 kids that go through a Dungeons & Dragon theme park ride & end up in another world where they meet Dungeon Master who always speaks in riddles & disappears unexpectidly. They also find a baby unicorn named Uni that joins them. They are also being pursued by Venger (voiced by Peter Cullen, who also voiced Transformers, Optimus Prime's voice) who wants their weapons & also are troubled by a 5-headed dragon.

As a child, I thought this cartoon was entertaining, but since I have grown up, its no where near as exciting as it used to be for me. For me its just kind of bland. The baby unicorn's whiny voice is also annoying. Again, its okay for kids, but if you've matured, this probably isn't the cartoon for you.",1377993600,3,954,4.514450867052023

Obviously it's not going to be a dark and ""cool"" adventure like one might expect in a typical DnD game, but it's a fun way to get kids interested in fantasy and possibly even inspired to try and learn the game.
It's dumb, but it's FUN. I didn't find myself fighting to watch through the episodes, or groaning at the characters.

The packaging case for the discs is pretty weird and unorthodox though. The plastic case just holds the three dvds in using paper cd covers. I was terrified I might break them just trying to get them out.",1375833600,,642,4.262295081967213

Like Spongebob,Dora,Johnny Test, and the most hated cartoon of all time. At least in my opinion Annoying Orange,anyway this show is great. And like the title is based on the very first role-playing game. Created by Gary Gygax and Dave Areneson.

I played OD&D, AD&D etc at the time.  Watched a couple episodes with my son (who is too young for them).  They are worse than I remember.

What's worse is doing this series took EGG away from TSR at a critical time.  You can see the slip in quality in this era.

I was too old when these were new, and I'm far too old now.  I am glad I got them at a bargain price.  This and the D&D movies are about on par.

2668747,5,B000JBXY44,"I recently got around to buying this DVD set (the same as in this image). There arre two (or possibly 3) versions of this animated series, in DVD set form. I went w/ this one. I've seen mostly good feedback about this set. And some bad aswell. Ultimately after reading reviews, I went with my gut instics & decided on this version. It has all 27 episodes (as do the other sets). And in my opinion it is a decent/adequate quality of DVD's and case. The case art is cool & the designs on the DVD's look good too. The case is like a regular DVD case. But inside has a pivital/hinged piece that holds a DVD on each side. Then, the 3rd DVD is on the back part of the inner case, behind the pivital/hinged piece. The DVD's stay on just fine. The episodes quality have been getting mixed reviews by people too! In my opinion. The episodes look overall pretty good! Someone stated it looks like the lower quality uploads on youtube. I would have to disagree w/ that. Even when playing it on my LCD TV's, w/ a Blu-ray player using HDMI cable, it looks just fine. It's as good of quality as I remember seeing it on TV as a kid. Which was cool for back then. The sound is also as I remember....Adequate. My 9yr old son & I have been watching and enjoying these the last few days. I'm sure on some older (90's) TV's it would look exact as it did back in the 80's when it aired! And some older shows such as this, don't look too easy on the eyes on new LCD's w/ modern DVD/Blu-ray players. But this particular set holds it's own! I feel confident saying if you are on here looking and debating on getting this 3disc set. You obviously know and enjoy the D&D animated series. And would likely enjoy this version!!! Could they have made the box/case even more fancy, sure. Could they have remastered the audio & visuals...Perhaps. But when it's all said & done. This cartoon is 30yrs old now. And even with technology, you can only ""remaster"" older shows so much. This 3disc set is only like 5-6 dollars for the entire series. And for that price you get a good transfer of the episodes. W/ a good cover art, good disc desgin, and decent (not the best, but far from the worst) case. Why knitpick and gripe about the episode quality? It's as good as it was when airing. And you paid a little under $10.00, after shipping even. For the whole set! The saying is ""You get what you pay for."" But in this case, I'd say you get more than what you pay for.  I gave it 4 & a half stars because yes, it could be a little better. But doesn't need to be.",1358294400,3,2526,4.2082474226804125

The cartoon is very well done for the time (80's) and really depicts how the original Dungeons and Dragons concept was meant to be viewed instead of the highly distorted public view it took on after some dumb parents blamed the related board-game for their child's suicide.

The premises for the series was a group of teenagers go for a carnival rollercoster ride and are magically transported to the world of D&D where they meet friends and foes on their journey trying to find a way home.  Each one is given a magical tool that seems to mesh well with their personalities.  The only demons are ones loosing and getting smacked around.",1356998400,,766,4.528985507246377

It is a shame that it came to an untimely end when it was really just taking off.  Compared to what is on T.V. today, Dungeons & Dragons was very tame.  Ignorance killed it off the air and now for those who loved it we can watch it and hope one day, another group of artist and story writers will take up the sword and strike down evil in a different way than reality, or modern times thinks civil.  Enjoy yourself and share this wonderful adventure with your children.  Mine love the cartoons of the 60s, 70s and 80s better than what is put out today.

2668799,2,B000JBXY44,"Dungeon and Dragons is about some kids that take a carnival ride only to be warped into the alternate universe, that is Dungeons and Dragons. their they meet Dungeon Master who immediately gives them magical weapons to aid them in their survival and who also promises to find a way back home.

buying a series, the complete series becomes hollow without an ending, this is the case with Dungeons and Dragons, I bought it because of fond memories and because I hadn't seen the conclusion.

sadly their is none.

the 2nd great sin that this series suffers from is writer fatigue, literally the last few episodes seemed ""phoned in"" brutally simple, uninspired and even for a cartoon just plain silly, the characters never grew more complex as the show went on is another negative.

save your money, sadly it's an empty experience.",1341878400,,827,4.802816901408451
2668800,4,B000JBXY44,"I picked these DVDs up pretty much on a whim.  I watched them a bit when I was a kid--I was about 11 years old--but I never really got into the series.  I had just discovered Japanese cartoons, and their more nuanced and continued plotlines made American cartoons look shallow and childish by comparison. But I have been a life-long D&D player, so when I saw how cheap the collection was I figured that even if they were as mediocre as I remembered them it would still be fun to check them out and finally watch the whole series.

I am actually surprised at how well the series hold up. Released from 1983-1985, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" was on the cusp of when American animation technology and techniques advanced, and some actual writers were slowly raising the level of intelligence in the storylines.  They are still the shallow, one-note, one-plot adventures representative of the times--they walk the endless treadmill of trying to find a way home, and do little else--but the writers managed to sneak in some actual characterization and moral challenges for the kids.  I was surprised to see love affairs, moral quandaries, and in the episode ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" even the ultimate question of ""Why don't we just kill the main villain and be done with it?""

Apparently, that moral quandary was a bit too much for parent's groups at the time, who tried to have the episode banned, as well as run a disclaimer before the entire series warning that ""Dungeons & Dragons had been linked to real life violent deaths.""  Ah, parent's groups ... there is an interesting interview with series-writer Mark Evanier where he talks about parent's groups' interference with the show, and how they forced the character of Erik on the show in order to give it the ""pro-social"" moral of ""The group is always right...the complainer is always wrong.""

After watching the entire series, I think the 11-year old me sold the series a bit short.  Sure, it is no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Record-of-Lodoss-War/dp/B000063K2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Record of Lodoss War</a>, but for an `80s ""Dungeons and Dragons""-themed cartoon it has a bit of an edge to it and remains entertaining. The character designs are good, the animation is fluid for the times, and it is fun seeing the D&D monsters animated. (It is miles better than the wretched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeons-Dragons/dp/B004W7PM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeons & Dragons</a>&nbsp;live-action film). I am glad I gave the show a second chance.

I got the Mill Creek version of the collection, and it is disappointing to read some reviews and find out that there is no real ""Perfect Collection"" of this series.  The BCI release had a bunch of extra features, including a Radio Play version of the scripted-but-never-made ""final episode,"" but they messed around with the soundtracks.  This Mill Creek release has the original soundtracks restored, but without the bonus features. It would be nice to have them merged into a single release with the best of both versions.",1341792000,11,3123,5.299595141700405

The video quality was good, the sound quality was a notch below the BCI Eclipse set but after a few minutes I didn't notice. It was nicer to have it closer to the broadcast versions than amped up, esp. with the original music intact.

Over all I was impressed. I own one other Mill Creek release and this was definitely an improvement for them as a company as well.",1338508800,,601,4.3097345132743365
2668822,5,B000JBXY44,"There are no extra features on this DVD but I don't really expect that either from most 80s cartoon sets - that would just be silver lining.  All 27 episodes are located across 3 DVDs.  I have as much fun watching it now as my kids do watching it for the first time.  Certainly is also a great access point to start enjoying RPGs such as D&D, GURPs etc etc.  Captures the imagination and you will have fun spotting vocal talent from other 80s cartoon shows that you might have missed all those years ago!

I picked this up for less than $7 (free 2-day shipping with Prime) and it arrived in time for a retro Saturday morning cartoon fest with the kids while eating bacon sandwiches as it rained outside.

Bacon was sold separately.

!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!

They never actually finished making the 28th episode - when the kids finally return home - though there is rumored to be a radio-scripted version of it somewhere.  I actually like the fact it wasn't conclusive as it then provides you a chance to play some introductory D&D with your kids carrying on where the gang left off.",1337644800,2,1078,4.487179487179487

I bought the series when it became available and I still can go back and watch it (though now it's with my kids). Cartoons of that time had a moral, not just rude noises and potty humor, and actual STORY ARCS.

2668829,5,B000JBXY44,"I just watched a couple of the episodes in order to assess the quality of the picture, and it's just as good as what I saw when I was a kid and these were broadcast on TV.  Just a tip... switch your screen ratio to 4:3 and it looks perfect.  When the picture is stretched to fit a wide screen, it looks grainy and the action is jerky.  This makes sense because the show was not made for wide screens.

I decided to buy the set offered by Mill Creek after reading another reviewer's comment that this was the one that contains all the original music score for The Dragon's Graveyard episode... and he's right, I just watched that one and it is perfect.  And the price of this DVD set is so cheap!  I picked it up for about $11 but I see now that it's $7.99.  The packaging is excellent, although I was a bit surprised to see that the disks were just placed into paper sleeves instead of being clipped into place, but really it's not a bother at all.  If you are like me... you miss being able to wake up on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons while eating your cereal.

2668852,2,B000JBXY44,"Now, I don't mean to blow the whistle here (actually I do), but most people familiar with this series package know it comes in a handsome case evocative of an old book that opens to reveal a Dungeon and Dragons handbook, an episode guide, and a handsome slip case housing six dvds. Yes, I should have inspected the pictures provided closer and I also didn't pay attention to the number of disc, but only because I was baited. The packaging looks exactly like what you'd get with the old set and the pictures deceive you further by not revealing that this is a thinner case with no handbook or episode guide in it! Now I ordered several 80's cartoon sets with this and all were in handsome packaging with descent extras. This is just standard with not even a liner art page inside. If it hadn't been for the dirt cheap price I paid for this...I would have returned it. As it is, the S/H I would pay is half of what I paid, which doing the math, this is worth more to keep, but hardly worth it in the first place.",1324252800,,1011,4.270833333333333

However if you just want to get the episodes and don't want to pay much, then this is a great way to get it.  The BCI version is no longer being produced so it sells for a heck of a lot more.

The characters grew up as teh series progressed, it was rumored they planned to further the experience of the kids who could never return home by them not using their weapons anymore, but
would've could've shoulve didnt... it got canned. :(
I loved how the stories made the kids seem real, and they acted like a kid in their shoes would, I also liked how no one in the party was superior, each one would later pull their weight and work with their personalities, insecurities, fears, wants and issues, again, they grew up, like in the episode where Eric gets to be Dungeon Master where we find out..., just watch it!

Cast:
*Sidney Miller, voice of Dungeonmaster ( at times I wanted to punch him, but he had his reasons to be all
riddle like, and seemingly a jerk for stranding our heroes in such a terrible world.
*Willie Aames( Woody from Charles in charge), voice of Hank ( The ranger and leader)/weapon/ manipulable energy bow
-one heck of an ""epic tier"" type weapon, or just plot convenience, either way I WANT ONE! Hank could bend arrows, use the energy as rope, flair, weapon, NICE!
*Tonya Gail Smith, voice of Diana( The agile, amazonic acrobat)/weapon/ extending bo staff
*Katie Leigh, voice of Sheila (the rougue, sister of bobby)/ weapon / invisibility cloak
*Teddy Field III, voice of Bobby (the rough and tuble tiny barbarian master of Uni) / weapon/ large club
*Frank (the amazing)  Welker, voiced Uni, Tiamat and micelaneous other characters
*Adam Rich, voice of Presto the clumsy, mega geek, magician /weapons/ magical hat that could summon anything if used properly, blimps, monsters, flowers, water etc you name it, and also as a weapon, his glasses, with out them he was prettymuch doomed.
*Peter Cullen, voice of Venger (main villain, and there are a few surprizes about him in the show),
*Bob Holt , voice of Shadow demon( Venger's spy)

""In Region 1, BCI Eclipse (under license from Disney) released Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series on DVD for the very first time on December 5, 2006. The 5-disc set featured an extensive array of special features including documentaries, commentaries, character profiles and more. This release is now out of print as BCI Eclipse ceased operations in December 2008.

BCI release is notable for having a specially created ""radio play"" of the final episode, ""Requiem"", that was never produced. This release, however, is also notable for having had some music alterations for copyright reasons; parts of the original scores for the last nine episodes have been replaced with various instrumental tracks from other episodes of the series plus a few from other sources.

In June 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to the series and subsequently re-released the complete series on August 25, 2009, in a 3-disc set without any special features but with almost all the original music restored; the release contains all the televised episodes but does not contain the radio play of ""Requiem"". Mill Creek also released a single disc best-of DVD on the same day.""

That should clear off any confusions people are having.

Unfortunately, BCI had financial problem and in 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to this series and it know as ""Dungeons & Dragons: The Complete Animated Series"" on amazon (yes, the listing only replaces the dash with a semicolon), which simply repackaged the episodes in a 3-disc set. The cover on the Mill Creek Entertainment looks slightly more professional, but DO NOT be fooled, it has NONE of the special features.

The BCI set featured a ton of bonus content including a 30-minute documentary, two audio commentaries, a 32-page hardcover game supplement exclusively by Wizards of the Coast, a radio-style presentation of the final episode that was never completed in animation, a short live-action fan film, alternate and rare footage, a Choose Your Own Adventure DVD game, DVD-ROM features, and 50 profiles of many characters and monsters. There's even a few more items I didn't mention.

The BCI set is a fan favorite, and although there seem to be a few audio edits that are know to exist in this set, if you're really a stickler for authenticity then you can always buy the Mill Creek Entertainment version at a later date (they're fairly cheap). So please, buy the BCI versions to get all the special features that us hardcore fans have always wanted. It truly is a great send off for the series.

Vilance is very mild and monsters are drawn simple, not scarry. Hope to show this to my kids one day when they get older. Even though the name was base off a game, it does not really flow with the game. The show is just diffirent. It may not be for everyone, but it is nice to watch and if your watching with with your child. You can enjoy that even though its a just a cartoon show. There are lessons in, like seeds in a field.

The extras in the order they are presented in the Episode Guide are:

* A 32 minute documentary featuring interviews with the show's production team, writers, animators, and network executives

* Two episodes (Night of No Tomorrow"" and ""Dragon's Graveyard"") with commentary tracts

* Full length animated storyboard with interactive episodes comparison for ""The Girl Who Dreamed Tomorrow""

* D&D interactive adventure

* 50 detailed characters, creatures, and artifacts with pictures, clips, and bios

* Short live action fan film

* Trivia

* Gallery of original models sheet and memorabilia

* Radio dramatization of the final and unaired episode ""Requiem""

* Alternative and rare footage

* DVD-ROM with scripts, the development bible, and storyboards

* Ink and Paint Trailers

For people unfamiliar with the premise six children are catapulted into a Dungeons and Dragons world (called the Realm) while riding a Dungeons & Dragons rollercoaster.  They are given magical weapons and role names by their guide Dungeon Master after meeting Tiamat.

Part of the charm in these series is that for three of the character the roles are the exact opposite of their actual personalities: the coward is made a Cavalier, the youngest is made a Barbarian, and the stereotypical science nerd is made a Magician who always has the worse luck getting what he wants from his magical hat.

2669047,5,B000JBXY44,"First of all, fulfillment by Amazon is a bust on this item. I waited 8 weeks with continual pushed-back shipping dates, finally canceled and bought from another vendor in the list.

On to the set itself:

-After reading the other reviews, the first thing I did was try all the discs. They're perfect! Great animated menus, etc. I watched the special features disc so far (most of it). Amazing interviews and dug-up art, etc. Very enjoyable if you are as obsessive about this series as I am.

-My hardcover book was also DOA, the last 15 pages or so had fallen out in shipping (they appear torn out by their own weight) even though brand new. Very poor binding. The content of the book is very nice and in-depth though. Not to be an apologist, but it's going to sit in its display case on my DVD shelf anyway (when I'm not using it to create an authentic party with the show characters in a D&D videogame in a stupor of geek ecstasy). So not a big deal to me.

- The quality is much better than the torrent bootleg that's circulating. The sound is sharp and clear, seems remastered, and the video is smooth and doesn't stutter (except the huge stutter during the title of each episode, which must be a ""feature"" as every version I have ever seen of these cartoons has it). I haven't checked the music against my other copy yet to confirm the helpful commenter who noted the changes to the music.

All in all, totally worth the money. I wish someone would do a Thundarr set like this as that has always been my favorite, and the bootleg I had to buy of that never gets any better :) If you took this show seriously and it was kind of formative in your childhood as it was in mine, definitely pull the trigger.

2669061,4,B000JBXY44,"When last seen on DVD, Dungeons & Dragons featured a plethora of special features, but one very big problem: music replacement in 9 of the series' 27 episodes. Suddenly gone were all examples of Rob Walsh's music for the show, in all episodes except the third season premiere, ""The Dungeon at the Heart of Dawn"". Somewhat less annoying, but still notable was the omission of most of the ""Today on Dungeons & Dragons"" preview clips, and the wrong credits for most episodes (with the ones featured being altered so as to not include the Marvel Productions logo). The darker, more interesting Season 2 opening was relegated to the special features disc, and only in a poorly transferred and time-compressed format. All in all, the set was a big disappointment.

Now, out of the blue, we have this set, a budget re-issue appearing in the wake of the closure of BCI Eclipse. And, happily, the set fixes the main problem with its predecessor: Rob Walsh's music is back! The video is basically the same as the BCI set, though the menus are far more spartan this time around, and the chapter breaks are a bit different. All is not perfect, though, the preview clips are still missing, and the end credits are still wrong (apparently a result of Saban's prior ownership of the series-one has to wonder if a future release will see the Marvel Productions logo return now that Disney owns Marvel Comics). Another big issue are the layer breaks in discs 1 and 2-they occur in the middle of scenes and are quite sloppy. Amazingly, Disc 3's layer change occurs between acts during ""Citadel of Shadow"". Since the episodes on Discs 1 and 2 with the layer changes both feature no Rob Walsh music, it seems as if someone encoding the discs knew fans would be placing a priority on the 9 improved episodes on Discs 2 and 3, and took proper care with those episodes above all else.

The packaging is ultimately the oddest part of the package. The back of the box has the wrong running order for Season 3, and the discs themselves are within black paper sleeves, which are kept secure in a slot in the package. It looks more like the packaging for a computer game, and is very strange. However, it's the biggest flaw in a generally satisfactory set, though I do find myself annoyed that I must keep two different DVD sets in my possession for the full D&D experience. Otherwise, this set is heartily recommended.",1255132800,6,2391,4.636792452830188

I have to say however that I *despise* the packaging. It's horrible! You've got the oversized outer plastic case. But then rather than have any kind of brackets or clips for the DVDs like a normal case, it just has the discs in paper sleeves in a shoddy holder. Who designed this case? Homer Simpson?

When this aired back in the 80's when I was a kid, I couldn't WAIT to see what was going to happen with every new episode, it was SO THRILLING and ADDICTING.  The animation was EXCELLENT, the characters were people you could relate with, and the stories were like something you'd see in a Big-Budget movie.  I can't BELIEVE that the Powers-That-Be in Hollywood have NOT grabbed this and turned it into a Live-Action Trilogy, it would be HUGE.  Hopefully, some of the Powers-That-Be in Hollywood are reading this right now, and will smarten up and bring it to the Big Screen where it belongs.  Even though this edition CLEARLY lacks all the fun stuff from the first DVD set, it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH OWNING.  I LOVE that they condensed all 27 episodes into 3 discs, that was a nice feature, but the BIGGEST REASON to buy this is because they FINALLY have the original, and QUITE intense background music in the episode ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" which is WORTH the price alone in my book.  When I read a review about the original episode of ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" with the original music, I honestly couldn't believe it, but I JUST watched that episode the other day and it was JUST as I remembered it.  There are so many episodes in this series that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED, but the one I keep watching over and over again is ""The Treasure of Tardos"" which I think would make a FABULOUS Live-Action movie.

D&D was one of those cartoons that I watched as a kid back in the early 1980s nearly every week without fail that was unique in two areas: First, it was one of few shows that I was engrossed in that wasn't toy-driven. In other words, unlike He-Man and most other animated programs I consider myself a fan of, I never had a D&D toy with which to continue my own version of the excitement once the show faded to black. Secondly, despite my youth at the time of its original CBS broadcast, this one managed to stick with me even after all these years. Somehow I still recalled quotes from episodes that I hadn't had any contact with for 25 years. Not bad considering I have difficulty recalling quotes that my boss bestowed upon me just yesterday.

So what's the problem with jumping back in to a series that I regard so highly you ask? I feared that perhaps I remembered it too fondly! So often in revisiting landmarks of our own youth, we're sadly disappointed in how unimpressive the experience actually is. We all have a tendency of making things more grandiose over time. I figured maybe Dungeons & Dragons was best left to the blissful halls of memory where it was, in my opinion, nothing short of classic.

That said, I reluctantly slipped the first of this three-disc compilation into the player in the hopes that I hadn't disturbed a childhood memory. Boy was I in for a surprise! Rather than disappointing me with a lesson in the limitations of early 1980s animation or the realities of standards and practices when it comes to children's television, I was instead immediately reminded of why I loved the show so much back then. Let me begin this review by saying that truly Dungeons & Dragons was ahead of its time on many levels.

The saga begins with an episode that aired on September 17, 1983 in the form of a pilot written by the then overworked Mark Evanier. And while old Mark would contribute only this single episode to the 27 total, he deserves praise for kicking things off on the right foot. Perhaps the show's greatest strength lies in the rich development of the main characters. So often in animation of the time we had heroes who were basically interchangeable in their lines. All of the good guys were essentially the same guy differentiated only by their appearance while all of the bad guys existed only to destroy the good guys. D&D laid this archetype to rest with six protagonists who had personalities all their own. Not only that but the characters played off each other to perfection. Somehow the show's writers managed to capture the subtle (yet often over the top) dynamic that a fairly large group of children would possess in their interaction. Not only that but these were children who wanted, more than anything else, to simply return home. As a result the writers were presented with many interesting dynamics of individual frustrations and the group's resulting resourcefulness.

To aid them on their journey was the enigmatic Dungeon Master, who appeared and disappeared at will but not before dispensing a clue (riddle) that would point our heroes into the right direction. Their ultimate goal was to simply leave the realm of D&D behind and return home to their families. While that sounds simplistic enough from afar, the show was quite unique in that there were no shortage of opportunities for them to do so along the way. More often than not, their staying in the realm was the result of a decision they consciously made to do what was morally right over what they desired most. While it is said that the proverbial ""dangling of the carrot"" keeps the show moving, the creative team behind D&D was wise to keep that carrot in the foreground of the action on a nearly weekly basis. While we all secretly wished the kids could just go back home, it was their failures that kept us tuning in week after week.

This time around I was far more aware of the show's pop culture inspirations. While the series was modeled after the popular role playing game of the same name, it obviously drew more inspiration from Star Wars than it did rolling dice and earning points. In fact not subtle are the similarities between Hank (the ranger) and Luke Skywalker, Dungeon Master and Yoda, and I won't even bother getting too deeply into the Cloud Bears (let's just say the Ewok village doesn't exist only on the forest moon of Endor but in the Realm of D&D as well). These uncanny similarities are quite forgivable however, as they don't simply rip off the blockbuster franchise but rather ""borrow"" from some of the energy that made it so popular even after all of these years. Much in the way George Lucas is credited for taking pieces and bits of classic film elements to give Star Wars its timeless appeal, so too does D&D implement these charms.

The other element of D&D that makes the show remarkable nearly three decades after the fact are the environments and backgrounds. Here is a program that finally delivers upon the potential that is so often flaunted in fantasy shows but so seldom realized. Somehow the Realm just feels spooky. Be it the result of excellently painted skies with many suns and moons or perhaps the fact that rarely are our heroes situated in the same place twice, or maybe it's just the interesting creatures they encounter lurking around nearly every corner. Whatever the case (probably a combination of all of the elements mentioned above) it just plain works. This type of attention to detail is present everywhere in this series and as a result, the show holds up even against today's best fantasy efforts.  The revised price of the Mill Creek release is the icing on the cake.",1252195200,3,6328,4.661290322580645
2669067,5,B000JBXY44,"I was hesitant, but I went head and bought the latest edition of the DD series. Glad I did now. Now this is a great release. I know there are no extras, BUT to the fans that are in the know, we got ripped from BCI in 2006. They tampered with the music in various later episodes, then claimed copyright, which made no sense, the UK released the series in 2004, complete and unaltered.

Now MILLCREEK entertainment has re released it, this time with the original music intact! For you nitpickers, like me, now is your chance to own DD without any disney interference! And at a great buy too!",1251417600,10,589,4.3545454545454545
2669068,4,B000JBXY44,"The show is a good one. Animation is good, but not great. Voice acting was well done. I like every episode is a lot different from the others, unlike many 80s cartoons where every episode the villains and heroes run through the same steps. Four Stars mainly because the packaging/case is fairly lousy.",1251331200,,301,4.69811320754717
2669069,3,B000JBXY44,"I just received an advanced copy of the Mill Creek re-release of the complete Dungeons and Dragons cartoon on DVD and I have to say that I'm both surprised and a little bummed.  Real quick, the cartoon was originally released a few years ago by BCI Eclipse (who also released the majority of the Filmation cartoon archive) and I was completely blown away by the set.  There were some great special features and the packaging was just top notch.  So when BCI went under this past year I knew that a lot of their catalog was going to go out of print, and as a guy who loves 80s cartoons on DVD I was kind of bummed out.

To my surprise Mill Creek announced that they'd acquired the rights to distribute the Dungeons and Dragons cartoon on DVD and as I mentioned I was both surprised and a little skeptical.  Mill Creek is the company responsible for releasing those 50-movie value packs you tend to see clogging up the dump bins at places like Big Lots and Wal-Mart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>) and for the most part they seem to specialize in releasing medium to poor quality public domain material.  Every once in awhile you'll see them handle a more commercial release like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Teddy-Ruxpin-Come-Dream-With-Me-Complete-Series/dp/B001LQQJ3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin: Come Dream With Me - Complete Series</a>.  Those Teddy Ruxpin DVDs, though cheap are of pretty poor quality and it made me a bit concerned for how well a show like D&D would fare.

Well, I cracked open the set last night and over all I have to say that it's well worth the fifteen dollar (or so) MSRP.

Packaging - This is where the set takes it's biggest hit and it's mainly why I dropped it down to 3 stars.  The set comes complete with 3 DVDs (each with 9 episodes) that are housed in individual paper sleeves.  These sleeves sort of snap into a set of grooves in the plastic case.  It's kind of annoying to have to pull out the sleeves like this and shimmy out the discs which are pretty tight in the sleeves.  There are no spindles or places for the DVDs to securely fit into the packaging.

Extras - There are NO extras on this set.  It's just the episodes and a decent set of navigable menu screens.

Video and Sound quality - The video and sound is almost a direct transfer from the BCI edition, and this is where I was the most surprised.  These DVDs play great and the video is as good as it looked on the BCI set.

So for those who didn't pick up the BCI DVDs and you're looking for an amazing deal on just the episodes, this is a great set.  If you're more interested in picking up a nicer edition, grab up one of the remaining copies of the BCI set while they last (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeons-Dragons-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B000JBXY44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series</a>).

Anyway, as far as the cartoon itself goes, I think it holds up rather well which is a credit to the creators and writers of the series including Mark Evanier, Jeffery Scott, Michael Reeves and Paul Dini. Like He-Man, this was one of the first shows that brought action elements back into Saturday Morning cartoons, which made it both fun and exciting. Its shows like this that would really pave the way for the more intelligent non-comedic action cartoons of the 90s and beyond like Batman and Justice League. If you've never had the opportunity to catch it, the show is about six kids who get pulled into the fantasy world of Dungeons and Dragons while riding a roller coaster of the same name at a theme park or carnival or something.

They each end up with special powers, armor or weapons that represent various classes from the Dungeon and Dragons world, the Ranger (Hank, voiced by Willie Aames of Charles in Charge and Bibleman fame) with his energy bow and arrows, an Acrobat (Diana, voiced by Tonya Gail Smith) with her resizable bo-staff/javelin, a thief (Shelia, voiced by Katie Leigh) who has a nifty invisibility cloak, the cavalier (Eric, voiced by Don Most of Happy Days fame) who has a nifty shield, the Wizard, (Presto, voice by Adam Rich of 8 is Enough fame) who gets a hat that he can ""pull"" magic out of, and a barbarian (Bobby, voiced by Ted Field III) who had a bitchin' club and an almost annoying pet unicorn Uni (voiced by Frank Welker, the man responsible for voicing two of my all time best Transformers voices, Soundwave and Megatron.)

Together with the Dungeon Master, the kids are fighting against Venger (voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced Optimus Prime on Transformers), an evil tyrant set out to ruling the D&D lands. I always dug Venger because he rode on a Nightmare and had that really disturbing single horn on his head. He always reminded me of another screen villain, the Source of All Evil from Time Bandits.

What I think is pretty awesome about this show is that it manages to capture a very specific feeling and area of pop culture from the 80's, that of book and dice role playing as well as Saturday morning cartoons (which in the 80's had a much different feel from the Saturday morning cartoons of the 70's.) Like I said above, and can't seem to stress enough, that the box set is beautiful and at about $35, is the perfect price for a nice nostalgia DVD set like this (end product gushing and pimping.)

I've got a lot of fond memories of watching this show, most of which revolve around getting up early on Saturday mornings, feigning sick to get out of soccer practice, and then vegging out to this show with either a bowl full of Chef Boyardee mini raviolis or Capt'n Crunch with Crunchberries, dry because I hated the damn Soggies. I also remember being completely ignorant of the table top role playing game, though I did have a couple of the D&D action figures, namely the Warduke and Strongheart. I think in my silly little mind world, the Warduke figure was actually more at home in the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome world than like a He-Man type world, what with his half on, half naked costume and evil red eyes. I don't know.",1249948800,13,6334,4.876163873370578
2669070,1,B000JBXY44,"When I received this item, I checked to make sure the DVD's were all there and in new condition. No problem! The booklet, an extra I suppose, which had pictures of the characters was in bad shape (pages separated from binding and one particularly raggedy) but this didn't concern me because I'm not a picture kind of person. Unfortunately, I didn't play the DVDs until several months later (my mistake#. The voices are all off. There's nothing more frustrating than watching a video where the words and the mouth movements are not in sync. I haven't ordered anything from Amazon.com since! I feel that these DVDs were probably sent back #i.e. the damaged booklet) and it was restocked anyway and resold, regardless of its condition. Actually I rate this NO STAR (0) because of the condition!",1246924800,8,791,4.823529411764706
2669091,5,B000JBXY44,"You know, if there were an award for the best company producing and distributing DVD sets in North America I would have to say that hands down, BCI Eclipse deserves it more than goth kids who cut themselves deserve a barrel full of happy face band-aids. Out of all the 80s TV on DVD sets I've purchased (hell of any from any decade) BCI has consistently brought out fun shows in unique and beautiful packaging at a very low price point. Just take a look at one of the He-Man sets with their vibrantly colored foldout digipaks, high episode counts (at least 32 episodes per set), the small color prints included in each set, and all for about $25-$35 depending on where you shop. And that's just the packaging. Their DVDs are also crammed full of trivia, documentaries, a slew of episode info, not to mention a few easter eggs here and there.

I recently received the complete Dungeons and Dragons cartoon DVD box set that was also released by BCI under their Ink and Paint imprint and it's just more of the same. The set is really gorgeous and it's chock full of everything you'd ever want from this cartoon. The set itself was designed to look like the core rulebook set from 1983, the same edition that came out when the cartoon premiered on American television. It's also set up like a box set (think shoebox) instead of the more normal slipcase, but inside is the same sort of foldout digipak that BCI and most other slipcase DVD sets come with.

This set contains the complete cartoon series, with all 27 episodes from seasons 1-3, a 30 minute documentary with interviews from the show's creative staff, a bunch of alternate footage (including the three different versions of the show's opening credits), a fan film, as well as a special treat for fans of the show, a radio play recording of the never produced final episode of the show that gives some closure to the D&D cartoon story. The set also includes a cute little hardbound D&D role-playing sourcebook that has player info for all the characters and items from the cartoon.

  I noticed that the music score has changed on many season 2 episodes.  For example, in the episode ""Day of the Dungeon Master,"" I remember a completely different score during the scene at the end when Eric and Venger are fighting.  Ditto for the scene where the kids are being chased by the dragon while flying on the giant eagle. I know this to be true because I have this episode on video.  Lame picture quality compared to the DVD, but at least the drama of the battle scenes is preserved.

Whatever the case (probably a combination of all of the elements mentioned above) it just plain works. This type of attention to detail is present everywhere in this series and as a result, the show holds up even against today's best fantasy efforts.

As far as the packaging and presentation itself, this is BCI here people need I say more? In the event that you've been living under a rock, BCI are the people responsible for bringing such franchises as all three iterations of He-Man, She-Ra, and The Legend of Prince Valiant to DVD. Their beautiful box artwork, disc art, color booklets, and thorough behind the scenes bonus features are without rival in the industry and D&D is no exception. This time around the powers that be managed to track down many of the show's writers, producers, and even network executives to offer up two full length episode audio commentaries and a 32 minute documentary entitled ""Entering the Realm of Dungeons and Dragons"". Like most of BCI/ Ink & Paint productions, this compilation is rife with scripts, storyboards, character profiles, model sheets, art, and memorabilia but most impressive here are the inclusion of a live action fan film and a radio presentation of the show's final (previously unproduced) episode, Requiem. That's right folks, the script written by Michael Reaves back in 1985 to conclude the show is not only here but acted out to provide a sense of closure to the series as a whole. Did I mention attention to detail?

In conclusion, BCI has managed to up the ante once again by releasing a collection of animation that oozes with the type of quality that a true collector would expect. The show itself is absolutely wonderful; tapping into the timeless ideals and morals that make most fantasy/ fairy tales endure and BCI's thorough touch is simply the icing on the cake.",1209945600,4,7311,4.724137931034483
2669116,5,B000JBXY44,"I used to love this cartoon when it was on Saturday mornings. My brother was more of a Dungeon and Dragons fanatic than me. He liked the actual game, I liked the cartoon.

The cartoon is basically about a few kids who are together at a carnival. They go on this ride and are transported to another realm, This realm is inhabited with many mythical creatures such as unicorns, 3 headed dragons, and a evil sorcerer named Venger. The kids, led by Dungeon Master who appears out of nowhere, says a riddle for the kids to complete a quest, journey or a way to get home. The kids: an acrobat, cavalier, ranger (with the best energy bolt arrows), a young barbarian, and a magician are given special weapons and/or equipment. Venger, the evil sorcerer wants the special weapons and equipment. So the kids have to watch out for Venger as well as the 3-headed dragon named Teamac who can't stand Venger as well as the kids.

The stories are nicely developed and if you are into fantasy and mythical creatures, you will like this. The box comes with all of the episodes in the short animated series that use to be on Saturday mornings. There are a lot of goodies within the box. Mine came with a metal dragon. For the price, with all of its goodies, as well as all of the episodes, is a great deal especially since there are a lot of DVD's that hardly have any extras or the ones that do, charge an enormous price. A small book explaining the animated series, behind the scenes material, and a lot more is included on the DVD's. The one disappointing thing is the fact that the last episode (the series finale) is not even a cartoon, it's a sound-bite like something you'd hear on the radio. It's been a while since I actually saw the series on TV so I'm guessing that the show was canceled before the final episode was completed. If not, it would of been nice for the series finale episode to be included. The cartoons look great after 20 years.

If you had any interest in Dungeons and Dragons the game and/or genres about fantasy and mythical creatures, this is a must have for your collection because I've haven't even seen it on T.V. in well over 10 years. Someone told me (if you live in the New York metropolitan area) that it's been seen on the Boomerang channel (carried by the Monopoly; Cablevision) but it depends in your location. I'm about 40 minutes away from NYC and I don't have the channel yet the next town over from me does. Enjoy the cartoons and the extra goodies.",1208390400,,2475,4.435164835164835
2669117,5,B000JBXY44,"I had almost forgotten how much I loved this cartoon series. I remember watching it every Saturday morning, anticipating each new episode and was crushed when it was canceled. Imagine my surprise at finding this boxed set earlier this year!

The DVD set includes all the episodes that aired and a bonus ""unaired"" episode, REQUIEM - presented in radio-broadcast format. My son was hooked after the first cartoon and watching them became a marathon session that weekend. Those who enjoyed the cartoon but didn't stick with playing Dungeons and Dragons (or even play it in the beginning) will appreciate the chronologically-ordered cartoons: the saga builds upon older adventures and refers back onto itself a number of times. For those who were inspired to play D&D by the series, or always wanted to play the characters, or fight against Venger, or wield the special weapons the kids had in the cartoon will be thrilled with the supplementals included with the boxed set. DVD extras add a dimension to the series for everyone!",1204588800,,1025,4.994152046783626

The great thing about this collection is that it is fun to watch and has the universal theme of good vs evil where good wins. I am glad that this show can teach my kids that lesson.

2669144,5,B000JBXY44,"Developed from an earlier concept titled ""Swords & Sorcery"" by Dennis Marks (Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends) based on the popular role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons (1983) followed the adventures of six ""modern-day"" kids who were transported via amusement park rollercoaster car to a mysterious fantasyland frought with adventure and danger. There the kids [garbed in medieval attire] each carried a magic weapon given them by the Yoda-esque Dungeon Master, their guide in the realm who seemingly distributed the weapons based on the kids individual personalities and abilities. The weapons, desperately sought after by Venger, the force of evil, not only protected the kids but also those in need of their aid which in effect benefited the kids as Dungeon Master informs them at the end of an episode ""With each good deed, you grow more worthy of finding a way home. In time, you will be rewarded."" Eric, the Cavalier (the show's comedy relief and most popular character) sarcastically remarks ""In time for what?--Our retirement?!"" To which Dungeon Master casually replies with ""Patience, Cavalier. Patience.""

Featuring the voice talents of Willie Aames & Adam Rich (Eight is Enough) and Donny Most (Happy Days); production services of Marvel Productions, Ltd; and stories written by veterans Jeffrey Scott, Steve Gerber, Marc Scott Zicree and Michael Reaves (just to name a few), Dungeons & Dragons was a crowning example of a great Saturday morning cartoon--so amazingly fun and entertaining that it left you thinking about it long after the show was over. Debates over topics such as who had the coolest/most useful weapon still wages on among fans today. Thanks to the folks at BCI's Ink & Paint (the studio behind the most exceptional Filmation DVD releases), fans not only get all 27 episodes of Dungeons & Dragons in an official quality DVD set, but also a cache of great extras including interviews with the show's writers and producers, plus a radio show of the scripted, but never-produced series finale episode ""Requiem"" featuring the voice of Katie Leigh (Sheila, the Thief). Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series is yet another top-notch release from BCI sure to please fans and viewers who fondly remember the show.

2669146,5,B000JBXY44,"This is my second time purchasing this product. The first time was for me, the second time was for my friend for Christmas. We are both in our 30's, he had expressed interest in my copy when he saw mine. We both have a common interest of role-playing and the cartoons we grew up with, this qualifies as both. I apologize in advance for unrelated comparisons with other products I HAVE had difficulties with.

The packaging, I had no problem with the DVD discs or the dual-layer (overlapping discs) digi-pak packaging. All discs were properly seated and easy enough to remove and not damaged in anyway. (Unlike Buck Rogers' digi-pak packaging which requires a crowbar and then a gentle touch as not to bend the discs in half!!)

The mini-book, that comes with the set was however woefully ""bound"", at least in my copy. They expected the strength of one page to hold the entire book inside the cover with staples, not glue. While the damage to the booklet is minor as the staples just pulled through the page, basically leaving me with a cardboard slipcover and the guts of the book, all still very legible, just mildly disappointing as is any new product you received that comes with odd, random, non-performance related damage.

The cartoons, were as entertaining as I remembered them and maybe even more so now from a D&D nerd point-of-view. (Unlike Voltron(lions), the content was immature and so very painful! Do we really need EVERY commercial bumper? damn it!) I didn't remember the music or the quality of the animation from 15-20 years ago when I had watched it, but what I saw was something I enjoyed and did once more. I'm not a die hard fan of the series or someone who scrutinizes things like soundtracks and digital cleanup of my DVDs, there are already plenty of those reviews done if you want to read those.

If you, your spouse or your friend is into 80's cartoons and/or role-playing, specifically D&D... they will most likely really, really like this product.",1197763200,2,1976,4.718840579710145

2669149,3,B000JBXY44,"When i came across this in a local store a while back i instantly had to have it. I have fond memories of this show as being one of the only real fantasy cartoons on tv...along with He-man which was a pretty cheesy show to begin with. So being a dnd gm (at least when we all find a time to play) and an old fan of the show i bought it instantly. The series is filled with many extras as well as a handbook with a short adventure using the characters from the series. This would be a good starting point for a younger player and would be a good intro to how dnd works (or worked since 4e is unfortunately on the horizon). The book wasn't put together very well as the pages where very loose and after my initial read through i put it back in the box and haven't taken it out since. So when i got home i loaded disc one and was instantly filled with nostalgia and watched every episode on the first couple of discs in one sitting. Something weird happened as i watched these discs and the nostalgia started to fade. The cartoons are cheesy and in some spots over the top cheesy but they do have some decent episodes with decent quests in them and i have actually been able to steal a few ideas for my campaigns from them believe it or not. Overall though i guess it just comes down to the fact that the things i loved while growing up are not the things i like now and the cheesy stories and animation of these cartoons aren't up to the standard that i set for my own viewing. Don't get me wrong i think this is a good package and the cartoons are watchable and when i have kids they will probably enjoy them but overall i just didn't enjoy them that much. So in closing if you have fond memories of the show but aren't into 80's animation very much these days i would say pass on these and remember them being as great as they were not as lame as they are. However, if you are into 80's animation these are some of the best cartoons from the era and they still beat the crap out of anything that is on for kids these days even if the animation is really dated.",1195430400,3,2059,4.073891625615763

2669172,5,B000JBXY44,"Unlike many others who have reviewed, I did not watch this series when it first aired, as I was only three years old when it was cancelled.  My girlfriend though, is several years older and remembers and loves it well, so I bought this set for her as a present.  After she'd finished hugging the air out of my lungs, we decided to have a marathon and go through all the episodes in a day.

And I fell in love with this series.  For a Saturday morning cartoon (whatever happened to those, anyway?) the characterization can be surprisingly deep, especially for (but by no means limited to) Eric and Presto.  Standout episodes include ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" for its ambiguous morality, and both ""The Last Illusion"" and ""Child of the Stargazer"" for their themes of bittersweet love.  And I can't forget the apocalyptic ""Dungeon at the Heart of Dawn.""

And then there's ""Requiem."" For a series whose main purpose was a quest to leave that quest unresolved was criminal; for the series to have a script resolving that quest but not animating was nothing short of a SIN.  Thankfully, at long last we can read (and hear, thanks to voice acting) what may be their last adventure.  This special feature alone is worth the set; my girlfriend had tears in her eyes when it was over; I softly asked her if the twenty-year wait was worth it to know the ending and she nodded emphatically.  I agreed.  All the other special features, from the commentaries to trivia to little games to storyboards, are also wonderful icing on the cake.",1190678400,5,1522,4.641791044776119

I live in the UK & own both the US & UK versions of this DVD Set.  You might ask why on earth somebody would pay two lots of money for the same item, what can I say? i'm a completist & was swayed to buy the US version which has far better extras & accompanying literature than the UK release.

After watching both versions I can honesty tell you that no digital remastering has been done whatsoever to the US release. I constantly switched discs & I was alarmed to see & hear, poor audio, wobbly telecine (where the image wobbles during a still scene), scratches & washed out colours.  The UK version although not 100% perfect has virtually none of these flaws.  I think you've all been conned by the distributor  that has falsely advertised the episodes as 'digitally remastered'.

One more thing, another reviewer has already mentioned that the 'chaotic, rushing' incidental music is missing from several epiodes.

The quality of the video is excellent. The episodes are presented on five disks, and the menu is set up so that you can gobble the entire DVD at once or you can savor each episode in its own time. The packaging is top notch, too; the cover artwork is faithful to the series, and lots of extras are provided, including a little board game.

Dungeons & Dragons revolves around six young friends who take a ride on a D&D themed roller coaster, only to find themselves transported to a mystical land, and each is outfitted with abilities straight out of the D&D universe.  Beasts, monsters, and other assorted baddies led by the evil Venger are abound; all of which have unique personalities and are greatly animated.  Sadly cancelled due to a parent's outcry, Dungeons & Dragons is finally here on DVD, and features all 27 great episodes plus a horde of features to make any fan droll.  There's commentaries, interviews, storyboards, a collectible booklet, and the episodes are remastered and look better than ever.

2669261,4,B000JBXY44,"Dungeons and Dragons was a landmark television series of the 1980's that became a beloved classic. Based on the phenomenally successful TSR/Wizards of the Coast fantasy roleplaying game, it focused on the adventures of a group of friends from our Earth, who were somehow transported to the magical world of ""the Realm."" They became unwilling heroes (and heroines) with a common goal: to find a way home to the world and the loved ones that they left behind.

Rather than be shallow in plot and characterization, Dungeons and Dragons was different.  The characters had depth: each had hopes and fears, likes and dislikes, love and sorrow, and a distinct personality that brought each of them to life.  Their struggles, triumphs, losses, and continued friendship and dependence on each other were the trademarks of this series, allowing an audience both young and old to relate to them.

Voiced by a truly rare ensemble cast, featuring Willie Ames, Don Most (of Happy Days fame), the perfectly cast Katie Leigh, and the now legendary voice actor, Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime, The Transformers); it set a totally new standard for Saturday mornings. To this day, it remains one of the most popular and enduring animated series of all time, one that remained in almost continuous international syndication for almost 20 years.

Sadly, it has not been available in the U.S. since the 1980's  - until this release.  Every episode is included, and has been digitally remastered and restored.

There are only two major departures worth noting:
1. Sadly, due to copyright restraints, the original musical scores in several episodes have been altered or rearranged in the U.S. disc set.  If you want the original score as it was intended, you might have to go to great lengths to get a Region 2 set.  In terms of quality, unless you are a purist, you probably won't notice the changes in the music unless you have the original for comparison.

2. The first season theme and lead-in was used on all of the episodes, including the second and third seasons.  They are not entirely remiss in that the second season theme is available in the bonus material.",1168819200,5,2141,4.900277008310249

Many cartoons look cheesy when you view them as an adult and you can't believe that you enjoyed it when you were a kid. Not with D&D. Overall, the writing is smart and funny. The best part is that the locations and monsters and situations have variety in each of the shows. This is what the Legend of Zelda cartoons should have been.",1168819200,2,452,4.329411764705882

I am a product of the 80's so this particular DVD set stood out from among the others...ah its my sons birthday I will buy them for him (Dad's way of getting something for himself without Mommy getting thoroughly upset with Dad).  Bought it...mine! =)

This box set is beautiful and crammed full of goodies.  The red box resembles the Basic Game Box Set during the time of this cartoon, very nice touch.  There are 5 DVD's with 27 episodes with lots of bonus material including alternates and rare footage; impressive for an 80's cartoon re-release.  Also included is a very handsomely semi-hardback D&D pen and paper RPG adventure set to D20 rules, adapted so you can roleplay the characters of the cartoons. I don't know whether to say ""thanks"" or to say ""great trying to get an old-timer sucked back in are ya?""

As for the cartoons heh they are what they are.  The episodes appear a little pale and flat, maintaining their original 1980's feel, not full of vibrant psuedo-restorations, rather nice.  Ah, seeing the intro where the kids get on the Dungeons and Dragons roller coaster brings such a flood of good memories.

I have one complaint -- and it annoys me -- the soundtrack is different.  Around the 2nd season, the D&D series started using new action theme music (instead of borrowing from ""Spiderman and his Amazing Friends"" and other sources).  However, this release replaces the music with some kind of generic action music, or with other music played in other parts of the episode.  It's like watching ""Rocky"" with the Matrix soundtrack.  It's extremely annoying.

I'm not sure if it's the manufacturers fault for doing this, or if it was out of their control.  For this reason, I can't give this 5 out of 5 stars.  But otherwise, this is a great DVD collection.",1167782400,3,833,4.689655172413793

The problem with this set is that there's apparently no one monitoring the quality of these DVDs as they go out. I've had two different sets so far. The first one had a mark on disc 4 that caused it to skip, so I returned it. The second set I got has marks on two of the DVDs and scratches on a third.

These aren't the result of the discs coming loose during shipping either. These are how the DVDs were sent out. The game booklet that comes with the set is just as bad. Both copies I've had just about fell apart in my hands. Unless you don't mind getting scratched defective DVDs, I would avoid this set.",1167091200,25,790,4.190789473684211
2669299,4,B000JBXY44,"The people at BCI Eclipse (and Andy Mangels in particular) have established themselves as masters at releasing cartoons on DVD with great care, no small feat given Filmation's reputation and the time-compressed PAL masters that Hallmark left behind before destroying everything else (or so the story goes). With Dungeons & Dragons, though, things were much more hopeful, just so long as the artificial commercial breaks, mystifying edits, and the awful new theme that Saban created for recent re-airings were absent.

Naturally, Murphy's Law had to kick in, in the form of The Walt Disney Company.

Nine episodes (every episode from ""City At The Edge Of Midnight"" until the finale, with the exception of ""The Traitor"", ""The Last Illusion"", and ""The Dungeon At The Heart Of Dawn""-one third of the show's 27 episodes, for those counting at home) have had three pieces of music-one ""oasis"" theme and two fast-paced, dramatic battle themes-replaced. All three were penned and conducted by Rob Walsh. To the experienced fan of the cartoons of Marvel and Sunbow, this replacement comes as a surprise, since Walsh's music was never removed from Rhino's Sunbow releases, where it is extremely prevalent, to the point of even totally supplanting that of Johnny Douglas.

What makes this especially aggravating is that the UK DVDs were untouched, ""The Dungeon At The Heart Of Dawn"" (a Walsh-heavy episode) is untouched, and Disney has created new music that is really bad, a maddening choice considering that the majority of the missing cues have been replaced by the familiar music of Johnny Douglas (and other than in ""The Dragon's Graveyard"", where Walsh's music is vital, the change is not immediately recognizable). We don't deserve this unexplained set of changes, and BCI *really* doesn't, because they have done an awesome job assembling features for this set.

First and foremost of these extras is a radio play rendition of Michael Reaves' unproduced (and nigh legendary) series finale, ""Requiem"". While Katie Leigh (voice of Sheila, the thief) is the only original cast member present, the voices assembled (especially for Hank and Dungeon Master) are close matches. Second are two commentaries (moderated excellently by Andy Mangels) and a very nice documentary. Third is the alternate/rare footage, but there are only two of the episode previews, and the best of the series openings (for the second season) looks like an ancient PAL transfer (sped up and zoomed in). Fourth is a plethora of scripts, storyboards, and other documents from the series' production. Also present is a fan-made production and extensive (and I mean *extensive*) character and object biographies (with appropriate clips from the series).

If not for Disney's imposed meddling with the soundtrack, this set would qualify as the best '80s cartoon released to date. It has a great deal of special features, excellent packaging, and even manages to (finally!) bridge the gap between the actual D&D game to the series. While I would have liked to have seen all of the ""Today on Dungeons & Dragons..."" previews (or at least known that this was an issue, so I could have contributed the two or three extras I have on barely-acceptable VHS tapes) and the season 2 opening at its proper speed and resolution, these seem like minor concerns when compared to the unnecessary music replacement on this set. Shame on Disney for downgrading an excellent purchase to three-quarters of what it should be.",1166832000,53,3467,5.140070921985815
2669300,4,B000JBXY44,"Having re-lived many shows from my childhood via DVD in the past few years, I've learned to approach new releases with some trepidation.  The harsh reality of growing up (for me, anyway) is that sometimes nostalgic feelings for a show don't always overcome its now-obvious deficits.  I'm happy to say that, for the most part, this is not the case with Dungeons and Dragons.

The stories are. . .well, not quite ADULT, but a little better developed than most ""kids"" shows.  The excellent voice cast lends credibility to the characters.  You really care about what happens next to those kids.

My only real complaint with the show itself is the shockingly limited animation.  The world of D & D is populated by all sorts of fantastic creatures and worlds, most of which are well-drawn.  But the movement, even in action-packed scenes, is pretty static.

Now, the DVD presentation is first-class.  There's a well-made documentary detailing the making of the series, a few commentary tracks, and ""Uni's Fun Facts,"" a text-only trivia section for each episode.  The mini D & D manual will be of interest to anyone who's ever played the Dungeons & Dragons game.

That being said, I would like to say I see a lot of complaining through the previous comments. There have been MINOR changes in the scores of very few episodes (3 or 4 maybe?), for copywrite reasons only. Reviews have commented that these slight changes have ruined their ""D&D"" experience and their memories of the episodes, etc. This is rubbish.

I too noticed the new music, simply because I did not recognize it, and have all eps on VHS when I taped the show as a kid. I still love the show, and its integrity remains intact even with the changes.

I did want to note that something neat I noticed, and have to say I noticed as a kid, some of the music used in the show was also used in the earlier Marvel production ""Spiderman and his Amazing Friends"". I love that connection, like sister shows or something. The same is true of ""GI Joe"" and ""Transformers"", also Marvel productions.

Stop your complaining people, and just enjoy the show and appreciate the time and effort it took to get these on DVD!",1165881600,6,1241,4.502222222222223
2669302,4,B000JBXY44,"I was an avid watcher of this series when it was on TV back in the 80's.  I had recorded a few of my favorite episodes to VHS and watched them repeatedly, but one episode was missing - The Dragon's Graveyard, in my opinion, the best of the entire series.

I'm glad the DVD set finally came out, but as another reviewer pointed out, some of the newer music pieces of Season 2 were replaced with the older music from Season 1.  This changes the experience in a significant way for me, so in that, this release is disappointing.  This certainly isn't the first time I've acquired a DVD release of an old favorite to have its music or editing changed.  The nostalgia of the ""first time wow"" is ripped away when they don't remain faithful to the way it originally appeared on TV.  So, sadly, this isn't the same Dragon's Graveyard I watched in awe so long ago.  Frankly, some of the music in the episode seems out of place.  The intensity of the episode really demanded the music originally scored for it.  It's strange that the music was changed for the DVDs though, since its recent syndication to the Disney channel retained the original music - but the DVDs don't have the small edits present in the currently aired versions.

One other problem I noticed is that in a couple of the episodes (Prison Without Walls being one of them), the audio is about a half-second off from the video.

Those problems aside, this really is a complete release.  I believe some of the episodes may have even been cleaned up and reanimated to generate the DVDs (this is especially true of Night of No Tomorrow, episode #1), but some blemishing is apparent on black backgrounds.  The booklet has nice renditions of the characters inside as well.

Episodes to watch for: Night of No Tomorrow (any episode with an extended presence of Tiamat is cool), The Box, Quest of the Skeleton Warrior, Treasure of Tardos, Dragon's Graveyard, Dungeon at the Heart of Dawn",1165881600,4,1937,4.576811594202899
2669303,5,B000JBXY44,"At last we have one of the greatest toons of the 1980's on DVD.  And, as thrilled as I am to own the complete Dungeons & Dragons series, I must confess I'm a little disappointed with the gimmicky packaging.  The D&D set comes in a very nicely decorated red box, the top of which, unfortunately, is poorly constructed with a weakness at the right and left sides.  As a result, mine arrived with a crease and a tear on one side.  The bonus ""Animated Series Handbook"" is also very sloppily assembled so that all the pages are loose and falling out before you've even laid a finger on it.  The DVDs come on one of those bothersome fold-out cardboard and clear plastic things.  Discs 2 and 3, and 4 and 5 overlap each other in their holders, so you have to remove the top disc in order to get at the bottom disc.  The whole package, when placed on your DVD shelf, will stick out about a half inch more than your standard DVD cases.  BCI should have stuck with the much more serviceable slim cases in slipcover packaging used for the Defenders of the Earth set (which you should purchase at once if you haven't already done so).  Thankfully, none of my discs were loose or scratched (unlike my He-Man discs) and everything plays fine aside from a brief instance of pixilation and static sounds during ""Servant of Evil"" on disc 2, and some out of sync vocals on a couple other episodes.  I also have to say that the ""FOX KIDS...FOX KIDS...FOX KIDS..."" chant at the closing of every show is really annoying.

Most people wouldn't need them, but we have hearing impaired people in my family, including my brother.  While he watched this cartoon with me in the 80s, he never got to experience it fully because it was not captioned back then and now, after years of waiting, is apparently not subtitled, unlike 99% of other DVD releases.

2669327,4,B000JBXY44,"This was my #1 favorite cartoon series when I was eleven years old in 1983. I watched it religiously on TV back then, and when we got our first VCR, I recorded every re-run and watched those videotapes until I wore them out. Naturally, I was excited to hear this show was finally coming out on DVD. I bought the complete series box set released by BCI right away. All the episodes look great in terms of picture quality. Not to mention, the special features are surprisingly plentiful for an old, mostly-forgotten Saturday morning cartoon, and it really brought back some great memories.

Then I discovered a very disappointing problem. And I'm going to sound like a real nit-picker here - but I gotta state my case...

Any dedicated fan of this show is familiar with the episode ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" - generally considered to be the best episode of the entire series. That's the one where the kids decide to destroy Venger (the ultimate, evil bad guy) once and for all. They plan to do this by convincing Tiamat (the ultimate, evil 5-headed Dragon) to help them. It's a very cool story, because the good guys basically team up with one arch villain in order to settle their grudge match with another arch villain. As a kid in the 80's, I videotaped this series and ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" was one episode that I went back and watched repeatedly. So, I know that episode almost by heart. One of the things I always loved about that episode, and which I still remember clearly, was its powerful musical score. Especially during the scene where Venger throws fireballs at Uni, the baby Unicorn, nearly killing her, and the scene at the end, where the kids have their final, climactic battle with Venger, pin him against a rock, and lead hero Hank has to make the ultimate decision whether to kill Venger, or let him go. From watching and re-watching this particular episode to death on videotape, I remember very clearly that during these scenes the music had a fast, chaotic, rushing quality - a theme not heard frequently in other episodes - which racheted up the energy and took the drama way beyond typical Saturday morning cartoon fare.

And yet, while watching this same classic episode on the BCI-released Dungeons and Dragons DVD set, I noticed that this music had been completely replaced with slower, formulaic sections of music that can be regularly heard elsewhere in the series. This change in the music made the scenes described above considerably less effective, severely weakening the emotional impact of this episode.

Allright, now - yes - I realize how trite and ridiculous it must sound for a 30+ year old man to be nit picking the DVD quality of one single episode of a Saturday Morning cartoon show he loved when he was eleven. But the whole reason I bought this DVD set in the first place was to re-experience the innocent fun of those childhood memories, and instead I got a diluted version of that experience.

As a matter of fact, in the ""Episode Trivia"" section, it even mentions that another version of ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" episode exists, with a completely different musical score... and when I read that, all I could think was, ""Yeah, no kidding, and you bozos put the weaker of the two versions on the DVD set. Thanks a lot!""

So... that's my one huge disappointment with the BCI set, and I'm guessing other fans who are total geeks for this show, will notice and be bothered by it, too.

NOW HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS... In 2009, Dungeons and Dragons was RE-RELEASED in a new DVD set, by a company called Mill Creek Entertainment. I had heard rumors that this new release RESTORED ALL of the ORIGINAL MUSIC used on the show, thus presenting every episode AS IT APPEARED, WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY SHOWN on TV in the early 1980's. At first I wasn't sure if I should believe the rumors... Then I saw that the Mill Creek release was selling for a surprisingly lower price than the BCI set... Low enough that I decided it was worth giving it another shot.

So, I ordered it, and let me tell you as a knowledgeable fan, that yes - the Mill Creek Entertainment release DOES include all the episodes with their original music. THIS is ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" as I remember and love it. Be advised, the Mill Creek release contains no Special Features, which is unfortunate, but I find myself not caring about that. The important thing is to have all the original episodes in their original form. And again, the price on the Mill Creek set is also a lot cheaper than the price on the BCI set, so it's hard to complain about the lack of ""extras"".

Bottom line - this is a great cartoon series. But if you want to experience this show in its original form - do yourself a favor: Snub the BCI set, and buy the Mill Creek Entertainment set. Take if from a long time fan of this show. I was deeply disappointed with the BCI set, and very, very happy with the Mill Creek set.",1165363200,628,4893,4.582857142857143
2669328,5,B000JBXY44,"I picked up my 5 disc set today (at lunchtime).  I will not have a chance to view them until I get home tonight. I thimk my little girls will love the show, they  will love UNI.

The discs comes in a fold over case that has a map of the world on it.  The 5 discs each have one of the kids on them.  Hank is on disc 1.  They are very nice.

There is an extra TSR book (small hard cover) that is also nice quality, I just wish the staples holding the pages seemed a bit stronger and more recessed when you flip through the pages. It seems like it could fall apart from use.

Everything comes in a nice box.  Overall a nice package and more than I expected, especially for a show that lasted a few years.  I am excited to see them again and view the extra bonus material.

Well worth the 29.99 for 5 disc, all the extras and all the memories!",1165276800,5,839,3.905325443786982
2669329,5,B000JBXY44,"It's nice to see some enthusiasm about the impending (Dec. 5th I believe) release of this series on DVD =)

I recently watched most of the episodes in brief and got hooked on them myself, although I never saw them as a child (born in '83, I guess I was just a little young).

These bonus features are going to rock guys, hope you're ready! =D",1164067200,3,342,4.166666666666667

2669331,5,B000JBXY44,"The best thing about this is that it will finally release the ending of the 2+ year series...

If you have no idea what im talking about then you have no idea that Venger is Dungeon Master's son... and the purpose of the kids in the realm.... but you will and don't say I spoiled it.. this info has been around for decades...",1163462400,3,325,4.158730158730159

Excellent writing, pristine art, phenomenal all-around!  It far exceeds Thundercats and Transformers combined!  I CAN NOT wait for this release!",1162857600,4,275,5.5
2669333,5,B000JBXY44,"I LOVE this cartoon!!!  I never missed an episode of it when I was a kid.  Much to my joy, it recently resurfaced as part of the action cartoon lineup on Jetix (Toon Disney).  After dealing with all of the overhyped and over exposed ""anime"" that presently rule our television screens, it was a welcome relief to have a great show on with American animation.

I'm just so glad that they're releasing it on DVD!!!  It's been long overdue!!!",1162771200,3,438,4.493670886075949
2669334,5,B000JBXY44,I was looking for this series earlier this year and it looked like no hope of ever seeing it released in the US. Now here it is. Super cool. Now if I can just see Thundarr the Barbarian on DVD....,1162771200,,196,3.925
2669335,5,B000JBXY44,"Wow, a favorite from childhood is coming out on dvd.  I accidentally came across this looking up something else, but i'm glad i did.  Unfortunately, all i can recall of this show was that it was rather colorful and detailed in its animation at the time, the characters were unique and fun, the storylines and adventures were interesting with more mature elements to it than most other sat morning offerings, and of course...the multi-headed dragon pictured on the cover!  For me personally as a kid, this ranked higher than TRANSFORMERS, THUNDERCATS, TMNT, and anything else that was big during that time period.  I usually wait for box-sets to drop in price or go used, but this one(the complete series for about $35-$40) is on pre-order.  Btw, thanks for the in-depth review/info from the reviewer above.  I don't have anything new i can add to that great preview, but i can add another 'highly recommended' and another 5-star rating to strengthen its average.  It really was a great show, and i'm sure it still is as soon as i can get my hands on the dvd's and relive all the episodes again.  Can't wait.",1162252800,5,1107,4.699481865284974
