1083970,5,6305836590,"This movie is different!!
This movie is pure crazy and funny to death, not like cheap way but in a classy and black comedy way.
It redicules the bourgois in the most deeply and mocking them as if they are pigs and most stupid animals that has no brain.

The story is simple four mid aged-about maybe 60s gathered and eat all kinds of delicious food till death. If they are tired, they hire prostitues and invites a school teacher- an slightly overwiight glamour woman to have sex.
They eat and eat and eat.
When one got sick because of the stomach problem, they got him cured by make him fart and he got out from hell. He was just right next to death. Then they eat again.
All those nice and great food are now no more great stuff anymore. They seem like torture to them.
One got sick of what they are doing and goes out and frozen to death by the cold weather.
The other dies finally who got a stomach problem. He eats and eats and eats and finally he farts with some poops together and he dies.
The other also dies while eating.
Now there is only one guy who does not really care that much about all that who is in love with this teacher.
Now this teacher knows that the guy is in love with her but she has sex with all the other men.
She just enjouys the pleasure.
But the man says I will still marry her even if she is having sex with all of his friend.
He seems so all right.
Even after all of his friend die, they being left alone, finally join together.
Some says those who survives who is in love.
But then again they are eating food together.

This movie is so funny when they are eating and eating like crazy even after they got sick, I mean really sick.

Yes there are some sex scenes but they are very minor and if you want hot nude shots skip this one.
This is pure fun for those who want to enjoy something new.
Funny but somewhat in a different way.

The production design is great.
The music is negligible.
The acting is Oscar deserved one.
All the actors are acting as if it is their last movie. I was sheivering from time to time watching their acting.

The bluray was remastered in 2K and was done really great.
The sound is mono which is ok to me. Knowing that it was shot back in 70s.

This movie is a true work of art and it deserves to be watched to more audiences.
You should all watch this and enjoy too.",1470873600,,2329,4.107692307692307
1083971,2,6305836590,"La Grande Bouffe is a novelty film with a simple ""what if?"" premise. What if 4 disenchanted male friends meet at a mansion to gorge themselves to interminable excess while they are accompanied and indulged by prostitutes?

Director Marco Ferreri adds in a bit of humor, irreverence, and a bit of the bizarre, but these elements aren't strong enough to hold the film together. The plot is rudely basic and inches along without any twists or creative development. The cast's performances are adequate, but the four main characters fail to attract much attention except when something out of the ordinary befalls them. With such flat and inauthentic personalities the viewer won't really care about why or how these men have become disenchanted with their lives (or with life in general). Instead, one can easily view them as props for a mildly debauched plot. The film is mainly centered around food and eating, but most of the food scenes are sorely lacking in imaginative imagery. If the characters have thrown most of their inhibitions to the wind and intend to go out with a bang, why don't they go all the way? All I can do is help but wonder how this movie could have been if the reins had been turned over to Fellini, Franju, or Jodorowsky. While La Grande Bouffe is presented with a slightly unusual touch, it never quite reaches the mark of being memorable or entertaining enough, so unfortunately, the film winds up being a VERY long 130 minutes.",1464480000,,1454,4.76984126984127
1083972,5,6305836590,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When it comes to bizarre films, Ill give just about anything a chance (granted the subject matter is not illegal or repulsive).  Sometimes, I think you just have to indulge in a bit of the freaky to get a nice dose of entertainment.  So when I heard about LA GRANDE BOUFFE, I knew I had to give it a shot.  I had heard the title whispered in video stores decades ago, but I never thought Id have the chance to watch it.  Now, thanks to Arrow Video and MVD Distribution, this cult-classic is available in HD.

LA GRANDE BOUFFE is one of those films that almost defies classification.  Its part horrific, part hilarious, and part, well, social commentary.  But despite how you label it, the film is crazy and a lot of fun.

I have to confess this is one of the more bizarre films Ive seen in the past few years.  Is that a bad thing?  Not at allbut I feel I have to warn you up front, so you know what you're in for.

LA GRANDE BOUFFE is shot fairly well, and it looks good as a whole, but you can definitely tell it is dated.  Still, the HD restoration seems well done, and the resulting picture is very clear.

The acting is excellent, with an all-star cast of international stars.  I don't think director Marco Ferreri could have picked a better cast, particularly given the time period.

As for the story, it is beyond strange and downright disturbing in some rights.  But thats a big part of what makes it so much fun.  Watching these guys work themselves into the grave is shocking but yet funny and whimsical at times.  My sole complaint about the film is the length; it clocks in at over two hours, but could have easily been wrapped up in 90 minutes.

With that aside, LA GRANDE BOUFFE is a big, weird win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.",1460678400,,1827,4.271137026239067

La Grande Bouffe is a french film that deals with 4 guys trying to eat them selves to death. Is it Possible? Pick up this film to see. No its hard to put this film in a Genre as it has dark comedy attached but its definitely not a comedy but as the director said in the extras located in this release its a physiological Piece.

The film is filled with a good amount of dialogue bu mostly lots of eating, sex, cooking, naked women and passing gas. No the film is a little over 2 hours and it didn't bore more so the is a plus, also lots off boobies and a classic Bugatti makes an appearance. Now the plot is small, yes! But still entertaining and also might make you Hungary but at the same time not want to eat at all. I also had some lol moments with the loud farting near the end and the stiffs in the freezer in the back ground was a nice touch.

Overall the film was a fun watch as it was something way different film wise. Yes it has what I like tons of Nudity, food, some comedy, and death. Im not going to give it a classic as of course the film could add some more fun moments. Plot wise it simple and it really doesnt need a fix as its just 4 guys who are trying to eat them selves to death and of course you don't know thats what they are doing until the ending is near. I knew what I was getting into when I read the back cover but the joy of not know would have been better and would have made a more weird experience.

With that said I give this film a 4.5 out 5 and I say check it out, give a try and enjoy it for what it is 4 guys trying to kill them selves buy eating, also the nudity. Some guy s***s himself

1083974,5,6305836590,"La Grande Bouffe is a film about boredom and excess, and ironically director and co-writer Marco Ferreri stuffs it with mundanity for over two hours. Ferreri, known for his absurdist comedy in both French and Italian, is probably most recognized for La Grande Bouffe because of its critical reception at the time of its release in 1973; it screened at Cannes, and it was obviously a divisive film for critics based on their acceptance of its dark scatological humor and its intimate look at bodily functions. The grotesque debauchery depicted in La Grande Bouffe is disturbing because of the way Ferreri simply allows it to take place; there is little in the film that feels scripted or forced, and instead the plot plays out exactly how it sounds: four men get together in a villa to gorge themselves to death on the finest foods imaginable.

La Grande Bouffe isn't a horror film in the traditional sense. Its more of a dramedy than anything else, a slice into the life of four men who struggle with the excesses that their successes have afforded them. Ferreri is less interested in giving Philippe (Philippe Noiret), Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni), Michel (Michel Piccoli), and Ugo (Ugo Tognazzi) any characterization of how they got to this point than he is in showing their depraved food orgies; in this way, the horror comes from knowing that these men have, for whatever reason, become so bored with their lives that theyve adopted a ridiculous way of killing themselves that utilizes their finances to the utmost extravagance.

Its important to note that Ferreris missing development of the characters backstories is intentional. La Grande Bouffe does not want to give the reasons for their suicidal intent, and that makes the film all the more bleak because of it. Theres a statement about hedonism and excess here, of consumerism and the boredom of men who have achieved and gleaned everything from life that they believe is important. Each character skirts around the obvious, that what they're doing will eventually kill them, and they also refrain from discussing any of their lives before or after their death villa.

At the same time, Ferreris incorporation of women is a pivotal moment in the film. Ugo, Michel, and Marcello are interested in prostitutes for their time at the villa, paying them for sex orgies and the engorgement of food because they can and they want the company that sex can provide. But Philippe, somewhat stunted in his developmental growth because of a sexual relationship with his nanny, finds solace and even a form of love with a motherly schoolteacher named Andrea (Andrea Ferreol). The act of finding love changes the interests of the men; they still gorge themselves, but they become obsessed with Andrea in a way that changes how they feel about death.

But Ferreri ensures that La Grande Bouffe reaches its grim destination all the same. While Andrea seems matronly, she morphs into an even more deviant person than the prostitutes who eventually become disgusted by the grotesque buffet in which the men partake. It is the icing on the cake, to make a food reference, that eventually leads to everyones demise besides Andrea. Its not exactly clear what kind of statement Ferreri is making here about womanhood, if any, but it is a chilling depiction of the dangers of extravagance.

La Grande Bouffe is somewhat funny, but its also disgusting. The second act in general is one long string of eating, peppered with fart jokes and a couple of scenes of vomiting. It is here where La Grande Bouffe excels; the dryness of its first act leads to a disturbingly dark second, and when a big long fart sound effect pops out of nowhere, its certainly off-kilter.

However, the longer the film goes on  and it is a particularly long, slow movie  La Grande Bouffe loses the impact it once had. The gorging scenes get less disturbing as the viewer settles in, the jokes lose their surprise. By the end, the film has succumbed to the same excesses of its characters by running too long.

Still, it doesnt detract from the oddness and absurdity of most of La Grande Bouffe, and Ferreris film has quite a bit going for it despite the rather simple plot. Many will find the movie off-putting, but thats exactly the point. The disgust of seeing these bourgeois men resigned to eat themselves to death on the gastronomical delights theyve cooked up is important, even if Ferreri argued against any implicit meaning. Its just unfortunate that La Grande Bouffe cant carry its debauchery through to the conclusion without losing the intestinal fortitude with which it begins.

Arrow Video begins this 2-disc Blu-Ray/DVD by stating that the transfer for the film came from a 2K restoration of the original camera negative. La Grande Bouffe looks quite good and probably the best youll ever find it despite some background grain. Dont mistake this, though; Ferreris film is not meant to look pretty, and it definitely succeeds.

The audio also sounds very crisp with original French dialogue along with newly translated English subtitles. Honestly, Arrow Videos release is probably one of the best ways to view La Grande Bouffe if you're interested in this style of film, and you also cant go wrong with the special features.

Arrow has pulled from a wide range of archival sources. The first, from an older French television episode known as The Farcical Movie, is a half hour interview with Ferreri discussing influences and featuring a few clips from his own films as well as picks the exhibit his style of humor. Theres archival footage from the French show Couleurs autour dun festival where the cast of La Grande Bouffe field questions during a Cannes interview. There is a montage of behind-the-scenes footage with interviews with cast members discussing their work with Ferreri and the meaning behind La Grande Bouffe. A heated argument during a Cannes press conference with Ferreri is also included.

Finally, critic Pasquale Iannone delivers a video documentary about Ferreris filmography, and he also dissects five scenes from La Grande Bouffe with audio commentary for a grand total of nearly two hours of extra features.

1084041,1,6305836590,"La Grande Bouffe is a film that shows its age and belongs on the slag heap of unwatched cinema history. Self-indulgent, pointless, male adolescent, chauvinist humour of gluttony, flatulence, and the other f-word (pardon me but it is too self-indulgent and completely impersonal to come anywhere close to being love-making. I would love to have used the more vulgar language which is completely in keeping with the movie, but amazon will not allow it).

The excesses of the late sixties early seventies are all over this film. While that period is hugely important in western history (Denise Levertov said America didn't enter the 20th century until the 1960s), to a significant extent this film is what that time was about for many and what many others wanted: self-centred decadent gratification at everyone else's expense. That it ends in the deaths of all four main characters could not be a more appropos moral tale. And I suppose it is meant as that, to be taken as irony and the ultimate end of excess, but we should have learned that lesson so long ago now (and should have known it at the time even) that this film is really just 135 minutes of your life which you will not get back and which could be spent doing something far more productive and creative.

As Seor Adorno said:

""It would have added much more to my pleasure if this DVD version of ""La Grande Bouffe"" would come with both Italian- and French-spoken versions, and also with Italian and French - besides English - subtitles.""

I totally agree. I saw ""La Grande Bouffe"" when I was 20 years old in a rather small Georgia town (Augusta, GA: Home of the annual Masters Golf Championship) and from what I can recall, the spoken languages were a mixture of both Italian and French, with English subtitles.

Isn't that amazing? A Bible-belt Southern city having an art-house theater downtown? At this little off-Broad Street hole-in-the-wall theater I saw flawless copies of Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957), ""Wild Strawberries"" (also 1957), and ""Cries and Whispers"" (when it was newly released in 1972!).

I also viewed pristine prints of Fellini's ""Satyricon"" (1970) and ""Nights of Cabiria"" (1957) and many other ""foreign"" films. They were the best films in town and I'm still very thankful for the theater owners getting these films to Augusta, Georgia during a time of 1970 super-mainstream movies like ""Love Story"", ""Patton"", ""Kelly's Heroes"", ""Airport"", ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"", and ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"". Not to say these are not good movies but I chose the less-seen movies when I had the option.

For example, that same year (1970) I opted to see ""El Topo"", ""The Music Lovers"", ""The Wild Child"", ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"" and so on rather than the more popular movies of 1970.

When I moved away from home to attend university, I had a lot more friends that wanted to see ""Amarcord""(1974) rather than the latest blockbuster.

I apologize for torturing you with all that. But ""La Grande Bouffe"" holds a special place in the part of my anatomy that remains unmentionable but nevertheless I would freak out and almost do anything to see one of my favorite gross-out foodie movies the way it was filmed.

The subject matter of the film is dark, not cheery. I saw part of the DVD offered here (in the U.S.A.) and it was just too bright and washed-out looking. The original film had more contrast between colors and the lighting was subdued with lots of scrumptious sets featuring, indeed, the Grandest of All Buffets.

At 20 years of age the lessons I learned about the consequences of over-indulgence to the point of death from ""La Grande Bouffe"" were invaluable. But now that I'm older, it doesn't seem like a bad way to go - even if it's physiologically impossible.

It would be a grand thing to have a flawless Blu-ray edition (possibly a Criterion release?). May we have one, please? Just the one?

1084139,3,6305836590,"Gluttonous decadence is the apparent theme and story in Marco Ferreri's exceedingly black French comedy(?) of manners.

Often hard to find on DVD or even VHS, the notorious reputation this cult film has garnered is well-deserved.  Feasting on this cinematic dish is an acquired taste, to put it mildly.

The story follows four wealthy, middle-aged on a weekend of fine food and profligate sex.  These men have all the material goods they could want; they have achieved the success proscribed by their culture and now, disgusted by what they have become, they are intent on devouring the culture that has shaped them.

But, really, are you what you eat?

Some critics have argued that the heart of this exercise is a ""satire of bourgeoisie apathy.""

Whatever it is, this at first taste savory dish is loaded with wit, contempt and cynicism that leaves one with a bitter after-taste.

The four men -- pilot Marcello Mastrioanni, chef Ugo Tognazzi, TV producer Michel Piccoli and judge Phillipe Noiret -- exit their upper crust jobs and make their way to a rustic mansion in the Paris suburbs that the judge has inherited.

As the men unwind emotionally and physically, truckloads of food arrive: Massive quantities of meat - lamb, venison, whole pigs and an seemingly endless supply of fowl -- are unloaded.

Quickly, three prostitutes -- Danielle (Solange Blondeau), Anne (Florence Giorgetti) and Nicole (Michle Alexandre), are hired as dessert.  No, make that side dishes.  And then they invite Andrea (Andrea Ferreol), a local school teacher on a field trip, to join them after her students go home. It is Andrea who most relishes the lengthy debauch and degustation.

The title of this French/Italian co-production does not translate well into English.  It's not really ""The Big Eat.""  In the UK it is known as ""The Big Blow-Out.""  And that's a much more accurate rendition of the meaning of the title.

This film is one of those bold tales that does not flinch from going all the way with the premise.  It's about nothing less than eating one's self to death.  It is literally a final blow out.

Numerous sub-themes are tapped and western - especially Euro -- conventions skewered.  The male chauvinism of the period is savagely mocked; the vapid pseudo intellectual tit-for-tat conversations are elaborated in witty parody.  But it is the wallowing in the numbing sensual pleasures of food and sex that is the lasting metaphor.  After the final fade out, there's no mistaking that this film is about life and death itself.  If that is not clear, it is when a truck dumps a final load of meat in the yard of the mansion.

As the men snort, grunt and fart to their ber-satiated demise, we cannot help but see them as pigs.  If one is doomed to expire from meaningless indulgence, why not do it at the peak of orgasmic pleasure?

This film is not the sweet delicacy that it may seem at first taste. It is a scatological seduction with a grim moral denouement.  This is art; offensive and intelligent.  And it is much more than a culinary orgy, as some have called it.

I remember film critic Roger Ebert praised the film but also called it ""decadent, self-loathing, cynical and frequently obscene.""

""What about the turkey stuffing?"" asks one of the men, ""Life is stuffing!"" is the reply.

Indeed.  How sad a conclusion.

This NC-17 rated film reminds me Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover.""  Greenaway's sensory overload makes ""La Grande Bouffe"" look like a church picnic.  But for me, it does not connect as viscerally to the central nervous system as ""Bouffe.""  Greenway's film is more about filmmaking and Marco Ferreri's is about life not lived.

Funny, farcical and oddly thoughtful beneath the somewhat contrived artiness that is French filmmaking of the 1970's.",1080432000,10,579,5.041666666666667
1084144,4,6305836590,"Some movies sear an image into your brain for ever. Like the end of ""The Wild Bunch"" or the beginning of Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" - ""Looks like we're shy one horse"". ""No, you brought two too many"".
I saw ""La Grand Bouffe"" over 20 years ago. I still have the image in my mind of the guy eating the two blancmanges at the end of the picture before he dies.
This movie is surreal, bizarre and wonderful. If we go to movies to see images and things we have never seen before, then this movie is spectacularly successful.
There is no greater movie about food and death.",1002672000,27,578,4.169642857142857
1084145,4,6305836590,"I like this movie for its outrageousness and its ability to combine an allegoric vision and a creeping reality: what are we doing with our lives? Where will this boredom of modern living lead us to? The idea of four friends engaging in an all-out ""Grande Abbufatta"" (the original title in Italian) is quite a perceptive allegory of what happened to the so-called Western civilization as a whole. It seems it has nowhere to go but to a formidable blow-out since its very beginning...
I'm not a big fan of Marco Ferreri's work. I think he was quite irregular in his output, but when he hit the mark he was simply second to none. For me, this ""La Grande Bouffe"" and ""L'Ape Regina"" (""The Queen Bee"" or ""The Conjugal Bed"", 1963, with Ugo Tognazzi and Marina Vlady) are among the best examples of black comedy ever to be given us by filmmakers anywhere in the world. His choice of actors couldn't be better: Mastroianni, Piccoli, Noiret and Tognazzi will be forever among the greatest in this trade, and in ""La Grande Bouffe"" all of them give us one of the finest of their efforts ever.
I was very happy when I knew this movie was being released on DVD because I had seen it twice in movie theaters: in 1978 (the Italian-spoken version) and in 1981 (the French-spoken version, the one on this DVD). I was hoping the DVD version would bring both. I was quite disappointed to see that it brings only the French-spoken version, with English subtitles. It would have added much more to my pleasure if this DVD version of ""La Grande Bouffe"" would come with both Italian- and French-spoken versions, and also with Italian and French - besides English - subtitles.
If I'm not mistaken, it's possible to do this with any DVD (if not, please correct me), for I have many DVDs at home with a choice of several languages on the audio tracks and an equally wide variety of subtitles' choice. Also, the music that Philippe Sarde wrote for this movie has haunted me since the very first time I saw ""La Grande Bouffe"". I have been hunting for this movie's music all over the world to no avail for decades now (can anyone out there help me on that? Was this music ever issued on tapes, LPs or CDs anywhere?). I was hoping that on DVD they would provide us also with a choice of hearing this sensuous and intriguing music without the dialogues, but this too was denied to us viewers.
For these two reasons only (lack of a wider choice of languages and subtitles, and lack of a separate track for the music) I don't give this DVD a 5-star rating.",983059200,33,2522,4.484782608695652
1084146,5,6305836590,"Once in awhile you see a film that makes you rejoice with awe and pleasure; this is just such a film. A celebration of life in 24 dashing hours, Grand Bouffe portrays a hedonistic reunion of four old friends in the grandest style.  A beautiful and thoughtful examination of aging and, ultimately, mortality underlines what is otherwise a touching and very amusing romp through all the delights of the senses.  Mastroianni is only one of a truly talented crew of actors whose poignant portrayals mold the wonderful script into a delightful and humanistic work of cinematic art.
