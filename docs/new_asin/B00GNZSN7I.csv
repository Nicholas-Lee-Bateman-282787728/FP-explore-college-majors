The version I saw did not have subtitles. Half of the film is in English, half in Hindi. It wasn't difficult to follow. This Bollywood production was 90 minutes long without any flash mob dancing.

It opens as a decent horror film with a suicide from the Grandiose Hotel. The music was typical of American horror films and the victim walked past room 3046  which equals 13, a number typically used in US horror films, normally without the audience noticing or it playing a role.

Seven drinking youths see the news about the event and opt to check out the haunted Hotel. They eventually get in and discover the TV from ""Poltergeist"", a shower from ""Psycho"" the room from ""1408"", and a wheelchair that could have been named Christine. In spite of this being a hotel, we later discover it was an asylum and is haunted by Maya, a former patient who likes things dead.

There are a few English words the Hindi frequently use: Hello, Okay, Guys, Bull S***, cool, Dude, and Man as in WTF man. Okay I laughed at ""WTF man"" as they actually say the letters.

The scare factor was fairly decent. Good make-up, suspense, sudden jumps, and music that was fitting.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity in Bollywood. I noticed 1 quick word that sounded like the F-bomb and most likely was.",1390608000,2,1296,4.584415584415584
