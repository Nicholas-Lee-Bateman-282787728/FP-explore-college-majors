3766309,3,B001QOGYBI,"This movie gets under way with everything going for it. Star-powered voicing features George Clooney. Merryl Streep's lovely low tones, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and more. Stop animation has made huge strides even in the age of CGI, and can provide some of the most innovative and engaging imagery around. Basing a movie on a Roald Dahl book certainly won't hurt it, either - look what Dahl parentage did for 'James and the Giant Peach', the various Willie Wonkas, and lots of others.

So, with all this going for it, the movie just didn't thrill me, and I'm not sure why. The animation, though thoroughly competent, rarely rose above competence - but did so nicely in the ""digging"" scenes and in any involving smoke. Characters grated on me, especially Mr. Fox himself, who I found irredeemably self-centered, the kind who tends to reward friends' loyalty with some pretty poor behavior. Also, I'll happily go along with a forestful of critters in educated professions and snappy tailoring. Within that context (and within his sharp-looking leisure suit), Fox's claim to being a wild animal rings false - unless ""wild"" means something more like a frat party than like a jungle.

So, I kept the characters at arm's length, and the artistry wasn't enough to pull me in. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm in no rush to see it again.

3766310,5,B001QOGYBI,"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie like this. At first, the animation looks a little cheap. The walks aren't that realistic. But after you get into the story, you don't care. The world is textured. It's beautiful. We don't see this kind of movie anymore, this stop-motion, and I don't know if it's simply just been too long since I've seen other stop-motion films like Chicken Run or what--I was enthralled.

This movie did not have an overly-typical storyline, but at the same time, it was not devoid of one either. The jokes were not written to try and provoke you to laugh out loud; you'll simply find them funny, perhaps to chuckle. But the thing I really loved about the movie was this--there was a lot of life in the film. Real life, something I identified with in the characters.

Don't expect a typical Phase 1, Phase 2, Climax, Ending, kind of film. Don't expect to be drawn into the story and be spit back out. This isn't exactly a story that ends with a clever line--it ends with the characters dancing. But I can guarantee you that you will enjoy this movie. It wasn't a ""good"" movie. It wasn't a ""bad"" movie. It was an ""enjoyable"" movie. And it's a higher honor to be an enjoyable movie rather than just a ""good"" one.",1260576000,57,1241,4.414847161572053
3766311,4,B001QOGYBI,"My family and I saw FANTASTIC MR. FOX on Thanksgiving, one of the busiest movie-going evenings of the year.  We were in a group of about 30 folks watching this film...a sad statement.  It's one of the wittiest (not just funny, but witty) animated films in a long time, and a truly original piece of filmmaking.  When movies like PLANET 51 or ...CHANCE OF MEATBALLS can make 5 times as much at the box office, I can only bemoan how many people have caused their kids (and themselves) to miss out on the experience of seeing how challenging films can be, and how much FUN that can be.

Director Wes Anderson is one of my favorite filmmakers.  I know there are MANY people who agree, and MANY MORE who disagree fairly vehemently.  For everyone who loved DARJEELING LIMITED, many more found it inert, pretentious, boring or unemotional.  Ditto ROYAL TENNANBAUMS.  Double ditto LIFE AQUATIC.  I admit, Anderson can be a bit ""clever"" in his style.  He films everything from a lower than usual angle.  His camera either sits still or moves side to side...seldom in and out.  He keeps us at a distance this way...much like his characters tend to be emotionally distant or shut off.  The humor in his scripts is often dry and laced with sadness.  When his characters to express their emotional sides, it comes in short bursts that demonstrates a form of being stunted.  His characters are super smart, and very unwise.

Yet in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, even Anderson's critics are finding much to love.  The same filmmaking style is there, but there is also something charming about the way in which he trains his camera on these awkwardly animated figures.  They are frequently filmed at ""odd"" angles, but what this does is allow us to SEE more of the character than we might in a more traditionally framed movie.  His reduced depth-of-field works even better with animation...particularly animation this ""crude.""  (It isn't really crude, don't freak out.)

Adapted from the Roahld Dahl story, MR. FOX follows its title character...a dashing, daring young scoundrel of a fox who gives up his dangerous life of chicken-thieving and living on the edge in order to settle down with the love of his life and have a family.  Skip ahead some time, and the Foxes are living in an underground den, where dad is a newspaper reporter (an endangered species?) and his son constantly disappoints him by having a singularly UNdaring nature.  Fox is a good husband and father, but his true nature constantly nags at him, and in a mad burst, he purchases an above ground tree in which to live.  And from there, he can clearly see the facilities of three big, evil farmers.  And it's a short step from there to returning (albeit without telling his wife) to a life of thieving and trickery.  It makes him feel young again and makes him feel he's being true to his nature.  It also gets him, his family and the whole animal community into some SERIOUS trouble.

There really isn't much to the plot, per se.  The film is more about little incidents, observations and conversations.  And it's all shown to us via stop-motion animation.  These furry animals move in a manner frankly reminiscent of the original KING KONG.  We see their fur move from frame to frame, where the animators clearly were manipulating the little creatures.  They are primitively constructed...and yet the film is 100% true to its own aesthetic throughout.  While many scenes look flat (and everything is brown)...there is a feeling of life in every moment.  It may be the rippling fur, and it may be the outstanding voice work.

George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and his wife is voiced by Meryl Streep.  Jason Schwartzmann is their cowardly, clumsy son.  These 3 work together very well, and although I wasn't sitting there the whole time noticing that stars were doing the voices...there was also a sense of familiarity that was very welcome.  Clooney has become a master of the ""wacky"" character (MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS, BURN AFTER READING, LEATHERHEADS)...and this movie shows that it is his voice as much as his physicality that makes this work.  Schwartzmann plays the ""dreary"" son much like we'd expect him to...infused with chagrin and sadness.

As I mentioned, Anderson's humor is often coupled with sadness...and we have that here too.  Whether Fox is longing for his past life, or his wife wishes her husband was happy with what he had or their son wishes Dad was prouder of him...that sense of sadness is there.  These are the richest animated characters in a long time (outside of most Pixar films)...and it's easy to care about these funny looking creatures.  There are many delightful other characters as well, including badgers (Bill Murray, hilarious), moles and so on.

But the movie can be readily enjoyed without reading much into it.  It's got loads of off-kilter humor (the shots of Fox eating are almost worth the price of admission!), a GREAT soundtrack (Anderson is almost as good as Tarantino at picking great music) and a satisfying conclusion, one that delivers a Hollywood feel, but is uniquely odd as well.

So please do yourself (and the film) a favor, and check out FANTASTIC MR. FOX.  It is, indeed, fantastic.",1260316800,16,5179,4.792325056433409
3766312,5,B001QOGYBI,"""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is an entertaining, visually pleasing tale based on the classic book by Roald Dahl. In the film, Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a former bird thief who goes against the wishes of his wife (voiced by Meryl Streep) and returns to his criminal life. Unfortunately, Mr. Fox takes things a bit too far, and his shenanigans cause three local farmers to wage war on the entire Fox family, which also implicates all the other critters in the area.

Children and adults will enjoy this film, which is beautiful to watch. The movie has great characters and clever dialogue, and it is so much better than most of the animated films being produced today. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.",1260057600,5,725,4.6640625
3766313,5,B001QOGYBI,"I enjoyed this film as much as my five year-old daughter. It was quite refreshing to have an uncomplicated story meant for kids that doesn't patronize--certain ""adult"" themes like a a married couple arguing over the husband's career choices or mistakes, the ""existential"" crisis -- are left in, giving you in the end a film that works, I think, for all ages. Well done by all. I particularly like the visual style and soundtrack. Her favorite part: the surprise glimpse of the wolf.",1259798400,5,482,4.819277108433735
3766314,5,B001QOGYBI,"This is a rare family friendly movie that feels like an independent film.  I love the humor and the clever story, which will draw comparisons to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chicken-Run/dp/B00003CXJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chicken Run</a>"", but is original all on it's own.  The vocal performances are great, but the real highlight is the stop-motion animation.  One of the best films to juggle being entertaining and smart for adult audiences, while remaining 99% kid-friendly.  This would be the best animated film of the year if it weren't for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-4-Disc-Combo-Pack-with-Digital-Copy-and-DVD-Blu-ray/dp/B001KVZ6G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray</a>]"" - but it's pretty darn close!",1259539200,12,853,7.252427184466019
3766315,5,B001QOGYBI,"Frankly, they had me by opening the movie with ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett,"" which by the way, is mistakenly listed in the credits as performed by The Wellingtons. Actually it is the soundtrack version by the MelloMen, but I've seen it mislabeled elsewhere too. And the highly underrated ""Love"" from ""Robin Hood."" How nice.

The entire score is as unconventional as the film -- dominated by banjo and rhythm tracks to give it an ""independent film"" texture rather than the now-obligatory John Williams-type score (not that I don't love those scores too, this is just a fresh approach and avoids the modern factory film feel).

Even the titles are clever, all in keeping not only with a singular director's vision, but also very much in the Roald Dahl style. This particular book, by the way, is perhaps one of the most challenging to bring to film since it is one of the few Dahl stories without magical fantasy elements.

I think the overall takeaway, and the thread through all the other comments on this topic is -- intelligence. That's a prized commodity in so much of today's entertainment, animated or otherwise. This is a film as smart as a fox.",1259366400,97,1152,4.721393034825871
3766316,5,B001QOGYBI,"When we meet Mr. Fox he's in a bind - he and Mrs. Fox get caught in a trap and she tells him she's pregnant and he promises never ever but never again to risk his life taking from farmers.  He'll get a respectable job, as a columnist for the local paper, but two years later (12 in fox years) they have a misfit teen and a visiting cousin and Mr. Fox is feeling middle aged and anxious, and itchy for the danger and criminal excitement of stealing poultry.

He's a wild animal at heart, he insists, not made to settle down into age and oblivion.  He comes up with a plan, and along with his friend, the possum plumber, plans one last heist, not just any heist but the big one, stealing from the fiercest farmers around: Boggis, Bunce and Bean (you know: one fat, one short, one lean, but uniformly mean).  They don't take it lying down. Mr. Fox's carefree and careless indiscretions turn into an all out war between the farmers and the animals, and everyone will have to work together and set aside rivalries and resentment and hurt feelings.  The danger is real, and they take unnecessary risks, but they have a lot of fun and adventure along the way.

I really dig the quirky and stylish vibe of the irresponsibly fantastic Mr. Fox.  Voiced by George Clooney with flair and a fancy whistle and a click, and animated in a silly and stylish retro stop motion approach.  It's a very fun film, and my wife and I loved it and laughed out loud, a lot, but so did our kids (and so, apparently, did lots of others who couldn't stop busting up or exclaiming around us in the theaters).  The film's got something for everyone, and stays true to the feel of Roald Dahl's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tale/dp/0142410349/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tale</a>&nbsp;while giving it the whimsical feel and quirky delights that can only be found in a Wes Anderson film.  The retro-stylish clothing and settings and the family dynamics, especially that between a larger than life but aloof father and a struggling son (played perfectly by Jason Schwartzmann), fit easily into his oeuvre.  I loved the look of the film, the delightful attention to detail, the colors and lighting were perfect, and the deliberately low tech touches, where you could see the ruffling hair and wobbling of water, just add to the charm.  Great stuff, highly recommended.",1259193600,111,2385,4.818627450980392
3766317,4,B001QOGYBI,"Wes Anderson's screenplay for the Roald Dahl classic Fantastic Mr. Box brings a refreshing update to the original with modern day elements such as conglomerates, yoga, bombs and supermarkets. The new storyline veers away from the original in a number of aspects but is entertaining nonetheless. It's really more for adults than the usual children classic.

The casting of George Clooney and Meryl Streep as the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Fox is the wisest and almost natural choice. Clooney's crafty voice and Streep's subtleness brings the animated puppets to life. Bill Murray voices the wise attorney Badger. The range of expressions on the characters and the comedic effects they bring shine throughout the movie. Interspersed within are songs from The Beach Boys and Jarvis Cocker.

If thats your thing than this movie is right up your alley. The only issue is the version that comes with a digital copy is a bit falsely advertised. The blu ray and dvd discs are fine the issue is with the digital copy. I don't know if its because the liscence is so old and past the date stated that the digital copy transfer will function by about 5 years or if it was always intended, but the digital copy of this film you get is the SD version. It boggles the mind a bit that the blu ray film gives you an SD copy digitally.

3766488,5,B001QOGYBI,"We love this movie. I don't think there was a lot of hype about it when it was released, and I can kind of understand why. It may seem like it's supposed to be a kids movie but it has a humor more sophisticated than kids can fully appreciate. People may not be a fan of the stop motion eirher. But in our case the whole family likes it. The characters are voiced by a lot of famous actors and they do a great job. It's one of our go-to family movies.",1515888000,4,450,3.902173913043478

I know they want it to be funny and realistic but it just got weird. I don't get what all the fuss was about and it was one of the only movies I bought without watching it first.
Its in my opinion not for kids either. Maybe older teens. I guess Ill stick with the classics A Charlie Brown Thanksgivingand Planes, Trains and Automobiles!",1514851200,,463,4.155555555555556

3766521,1,B001QOGYBI,"Kid: I am ten years old. I just finished the book, so my mom got the movie. Well I loved the book, but the movie was not good. The ratings where good, but I think the movie was weak. The movie line was very different from the book.  The book's story was simple and sweet but the movie had a more complex and long story.  There was no emotion in the characters in the movie. I love to rewatch movies but this one I could not sit through again.

Mom: I am the mom that bought the movie as a reward for my son for his prompt reading of the book.  Our family has always enjoyed Roald Dahl and historically the movie versions of his books have been fantastic (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG).  With voices like Meryl Streep, Owen Wilson, and George Clooney, I thought it was going to rival all the others.  It was a disappointment. I couldn't even finish watching it (Opted to do laundry instead and I hate laundry).  The stop motions was entertaining, but the story line and the unemotional delivery of the dialogue was underwhelming for us. I guess it could be entertaining in a Monty Pythons or Rocky Horror Picture Show kind of way, where it is the ""badness"" (and probably some alcohol) that makes it funny. For good clean family enjoyment, it was a bomb.",1512345600,,1275,4.377118644067797

3766538,5,B001QOGYBI,"I must admit, I thought this looked like a weird attempt by Wes Anderson to make a children's movie. I never saw a trailer for it, and never thought about watching it until recently. We are fans of Wes Anderson, so we finally decided to buy it since we own all his other films.

The bad attitude and snark.  My kids enjoyed the movie, although they found it confusing.  When Mr Fox KILLS the rat and floats him away down the sewer, my four year old wondered ""What are they doing to Mr Rat?"" I just found that entire scene disturbing in an animated film.

3767162,2,B001QOGYBI,"I only gave it two stars because they did a decent job with the animation. I won't compare it with the Roald Dahl book which I never read, but it doesn't make a difference, The movie was charmless and so bland and boring I bailed after twenty minutes. I doubt even little kids would enjoy this.

So what happens? Mr. and Mrs. Fox are at a farm, first conversing, then stealing a squab from it. Then Mr. Fox sees a trap and gets curious and ends up trapping himself and his wife in it. Then all of a sudden, two years pass (no explanation of how they got out of the trap) and they have an adolescent son, then they have a young cousin visit when his father is ill. In the meantime, Mr. Fox got a job in the newspapers and they move from their old hole into a tree home, even though they are located near disreputable farmers.

My description makes the movie sound more interesting than it actually was. Where there should have been laughs and/or excitement, there are none. Everything is done in such a bland and blah way, even the puppets seemed like they were bored and wished they were somewhere else. Not for kids, adults, or anybody else, unless they need assistance in falling asleep.",1474761600,,1189,4.375565610859729
3767163,2,B001QOGYBI,"This is an odd pairing.

Robots is a great family film. It is suited for kids younger and older with plenty of jokes for parents to enjoy as well. It is far from an animated classic, but it is better than many films.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a quirky film. It is a Wes Anderson film based on a Roald Dahl book. Both Anderson and Dahl are known for quirky, so the double dose in a single film is interesting. It is enjoyable, but not as wide audience appropriate as the other film.

Since I spotted this double pack on a cheap rack in a grocery store, it has plagued me why they should be placed together.  Another set on the same rack paired Fantastic Mr. Fox with Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. Corporate rights ownership can make strange bedfellows.

I'd rather have Fantastic Mr. Fox paired with another Anderson film, Rushmore, Darjeeling, Grand Budapest, Royal Tenenbaums, or something. Ultimately, it would make more sense to me. It would also fit better on the DVD rack, although in all fairness single volume DVDs fit better in the alphabetically organized rack than any budget twin pack. Perhaps it is my own quirk.

I would not have bought Robots on its own.

The films are good, but I've dropped my star rating to replace the oddity of the pairing.
This is a slim line case with two discs neatly packaged. So at least that is better than a double sided disc or something onerous.",1474588800,,1388,4.50597609561753

3767417,5,B001QOGYBI,"Definitely not the original story but just as enjoyable. The typical unique Wes Anderson humor and style but with a twist. Whether you want something light hearted or with a bit of a heavy story. this is the perfect film. One of those ""sit back and enjoy the screen"" films.",1468800000,2,273,4.48
3767418,5,B001QOGYBI,"This has become a family favorite.  It has an all-star cast.  The dialogue is weird and witty.  Wes Anderson directs this show smartly.  Of course being written by Roald Dahl, you have to anticipate the strange in character and plot.  The stop animation is quirky and hysterical.  Unlike any other film.  Wes Anderson directs this show smartly.  We have watched this again and again.  It is clean even with all the cussing (every expletive is replaced with the word ""cuss"").  Good viewing from infant to antiquity.

3767448,4,B001QOGYBI,"Intended to watch this movie with my young children after reading the Roald Dahl book together with them.  I didn't do much research, and didn't realize it was a Wes Anderson movie (admittedly, my own mistake).  If you love Wes Anderson, you will love this movie.  If you are looking for a family-friendly movie to watch with your young kids that is similar in maturity level and content to the children's book of the same name (which only slightly resembles the movie plot), you will find that you've gotten much more than you anticipated (and not necessarily in a good way).  I thought it was entertaining, but I cringed through some of the scenes (including the ""cuss"" scene mentioned by other reviewers) while deciding whether I should find something else for my kids to watch.",1468195200,,781,4.762962962962963

One of my elementary aged kids drew x's for the eyes on a penguin for his art project and his teacher saved it to show me during parent teacher conference.

And we've always been great fans of British writer Roald Dahl, who wrote the book this movie is derived from. So I was prepared to like this, and I absolutely did. Indeed it's my favorite Wes Anderson after 'Rushmore'. Watched it again recently through Amazon Prime and liked it as much as first time I saw it.

3767845,4,B001QOGYBI,"I originally saw this on TV one day and unfortunately had missed half the movie, so when I recieved this as one of my Christmas gifts this year, I was very happy to see it all the way through and uncut.  I have to say I am wary when it comes to movies that have been taken from literature, but I was happy to see that the overall story line had been kept pretty much intact.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see that it was Wes Anderson who directed it and was much appreciative that it was done in stop motion rather than digital.  I really liked that it was stop motion because it is a dying art and gives the movie a feeling of realness to it.  This art form is also support with a great cast to portray Roald Dahl's wonderful and witty characters.  I also enjoyed that they took a little bit of poetic liscence and made it their own and put a new twist on the story itself.  I would also say this is a movie for a more adult audience because of the humor and a few parts might be a little scary for small kids.  I have heard that some people take pieces from Wes Anderson's sets and I have to say I would have loved the wolf from this set!",1453939200,,1146,4.0

3767882,3,B001QOGYBI,"The problem with this movie is that it's a little too much Wes Anderson and not enough Roald Dahl. Now, I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson, I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Royal-Tenenbaums/dp/B004LL86QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>&nbsp;is a masterpiece...but it's not the same sort of humor that works with Mr. Fox.

When I was a kid, I found this book delightful because of the sincere adoration Mrs. Fox had for Mr. Fox. She'd set all the children aside and say, ""your father is a fantastic fox,"" and Mr. Fox would be filled with warmth. Look...that's not the type of scenario you EVER see in real life, which is why it was fun. In this movie adaptation, Mrs. Fox and Mr. Fox kind of bicker...great, that's just what most families get at home anyway, why go to the movies?

All that being said, there are some really funny scenes. I liked the chase at the end although again it represents a complete departure from Dahl's work. Honestly, the changes are so great that this should be called a collaboration between Dahl and Anderson rather than an adaptation of Dahl's book. I guess the problem is that if you loved the book, you might find this movie to be too much of a departure.

Also, there are a couple semi violent scenes that might confuse kids under the age of 5. For example, Fox and Badger snap and snarl at each other during a loan closing. The scene is kind of funny, but I caught my kids looking at each other a little unsure as to what was going on.",1450310400,,1539,4.8

It is based on a storybook, which I never read to my kids. I don't really like all the lying, sneaking, and stealing, which is supposed to be funny and the protagonist is really an antagonist.

I have been happy to purchase Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Combo packages for some time now.  I hope more studios get on board an offer these combo packages complete with Ultraviolet/VUDU codes.  It's nice to get the Blu-ray and DVD together.  For me, the digital version of the movie is a really nice bonus.  As a consumer that still insists upon physical copies of all media I purchase (CDs, DVDs, software, etc) I find that I often use the digital copy to view my purchased movies.  I am slowly building a collection of digital movies with the Ultraviolet/VUDU services.  That being said, I was really disappointed to open up the packaging on this movie to find that the digital copy was NOT an Ultraviolet/VUDU digital copy.  There is a separate disc you put into your PC or Mac and enter a code to access the digital copy.  This is NOT what I was expecting.

My son read the book after watching the movie and asked ""where are all of the 'good' characters?  Yes, the creative talent behind this movie took dozens of liberties to translate the book into film, but I love each and every one of them.

3768256,5,B001QOGYBI,"What can I say about this particular release of the movie that hasn't already been said by people who bought the Criterion Collection edition. Well, compared to the 20th Century Fox blu-ray release, this definitely has more bonus features for anyone who wishes to know certain behind-the-scenes aspects. In terms of picture quality, the Criterion Collection release is slightly better than the earlier 20th Century Fox release, though unless you are a visual-phile it's not that big of a difference. This release is also the second time in over 20 years Criterion Collection has released an animated film (the first being the 1989 Streamline Dub of Akira on laserdisc); so for people who want to try and get Criterion Collection to release either cult-classic or obscure animated films, buying and supporting this release may help give Criterion Collection the incentive to do more animated film releases. Because otherwise the general consensus is that the only reason Criterion Collection is even giving this film a release is because it's part of Wes Anderson's directing catalog.

One very minor nitpick I have about this release though is that unlike the earlier 20th Century Fox release which has both Spanish and French audio tracks and multiple subtitles, the Criterion Collection release sadly only has an English language audio track and subtitles. This makes it especially disheartening for those who wish to try and import this release..",1441929600,4,1449,5.218884120171674

3768490,4,B001QOGYBI,"I have never been a big Wes Anderson fan.  I appreciate his aesthetic style and attention to framing,  but I could never really get behind his corky humor, unrealistic characters, and jarring dialogue.  This holds true for ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", and ""Moonrise Kingdom"".

But ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" has changed everything.  I don't know if it is due to the cartoon nature of the movie, or a screenplay that was better than the others; but for the first time I feel like I understand what Wes is trying to do.  The characters were perfect, the humor was funny, and the dialogue was witty.  I was truly surprised that one movie set at the right pitch could change my entire perspective on a director's body of work.  I look forward to watching the ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" with my new found understanding of Wes Anderson and his surrealistic world.",1438905600,2,870,4.791946308724833

This movie have, for me, a fatal flaw, which is casting George Clooney as Mr. Fox. He's too old and plays a very flat fox. I would have cast someone that could bring a little less confidence and bravado to the character, like Paul Giammatti or Steve Buschemi. Clooney feels like casting as marketing.

I recommended my friends to watch this movie especially since the actors/actresses are well-known to many and I believe that gets people to want to watch movies. I love when they cuss they say 'cuss' instead of an actual cuss word and I occasionally use that when I think about this movie. It's a movie about animals living like humans and trying to live without getting killed but along the way mr. fox gets greedy and complicates and makes it difficult to not get killed. It's a funny, actiony, fast-paced, feel-good movie and I recommend this to anyone.",1436572800,,686,4.585365853658536

I think he has asked to watch this at least a dozen times in the last three weeks since we finished the book. Both parents and kids can enjoy this together.,1435795200,,430,4.011627906976744

3768761,3,B001QOGYBI,"The movie itself is great.  A warning if you are buying this for the digital copy.  This is the old style Digital Copy - which means (supposedly) that you copy it to your device, not that you can redeem the code to stream online, which is how most of these work now.  Additionally, the copy that I purchased had a code for digital copy that expired in 2012 (for a 2015 purchase).

You really feel the direction of Wes Anderson - this is not another movie churned out for kids, but a passion project. My seven-year-old loves it but we love it too. Highly entertaining for parents. Visually the stop animation is a bit crude, but I infinitely prefer it to the 3D computer animation so prevalent today. The facial expressions are incredible. He captured some of the depth and darkness of Roald Dahl's original book with this adaptation.

My two older boys read the book (ages 9 and 7), so we gave the movie a shot. It has a great cast and Wes Anderson has a unique style similar to Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  My kids enjoyed the claymation action sequences and the general silliness. My wife and I enjoyed all of the quips Wes Anderson put in the dialogue; George Clooney did a great job pulling off the quick-wittedness of the fox.

3769078,3,B001QOGYBI,"3   Stars.  Creative, whimsical, charming; the creation of a small world peopled with creatures that seem familiar and endearing.  I loved the artwork and animation- like moving folk art.  I enjoyed it, but... it may sound ridiculous to those of you who aren't bird lovers, but birds were given such short-shrift it dimmed the tale for me some.

I'm an animal lover- most of all, birds.  I've rehabilitated and returned to the wild many injured birds, from robins to jays, sea gulls to crows (the latter nearly as smart as we are, smarter in some ways).  I've had pet/wild birds (that fly free) with whom I've had relationships that have lasted years.

I know, I know, it's just a movie but imagine if you were a cat lover and cats were treated with so little regard, as nothing but a food source, utterly inconsequential (wring their necks like SO and stuff them into bags, lah-dee-dah).  Curious, when other animals (except dogs) were treated as such distinct and valued individuals (I've had ""pet"" possums too, so happier with their depiction).  The humans were well-done but unsavory, quite creepy.  I haven't read the book, I'm curious to see how much it paralleled the film.  Many of the animals foxes hunt and eat were their friends in the film- somewhere along the way someone decided that their main food source would be domestic poultry, in service to the plot, I guess.

I try not to be literal-minded, but another thing I stumbled over was the relative sizes of the animals.  The Fox family was proportioned like a human family, and yet the rat and most of the other animals were roughly the same size as they.  And where did they get the little motorcycle with sidecar?  I know, dramatic license- just sayin'!

What I liked best was the world that was crafted, the look of everything, and, the characterization, of Mr. Fox and the two young foxes in particular- well-done.  Mrs. Fox was something of a stereotypical wife (and nearly all characters are male, so not a good film for girls), but Mr. Fox was glorious (narcissistic, slightly crooked, but charming, disarming).  And the voices of favorite actors- delightful.  In a nutshell, I don't think this movie knew quite what it wanted to be and its more obvious charms overshadowed that fact, perhaps.  Heartwarming family story?  Not quite.  Quirky?  Definitely.  Existential- yes, some, with unsettling themes (danger and death lurking), but perhaps not enough to resonate with most people's experience (mine anyway).  I bought this on the strength of reviews- had I seen it first I wouldn't have, but I AM glad I saw it- definitely like nothing else.",1424131200,2,2619,4.813901345291479

DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS THINKING IT'S GOOD, CLEAN FUN.  IT'S NOT!!!!!!!!!  This is actually an adult-themed movie in kid's clothing.  I found myself actually thinking -- ""who is really behind this movie -- the tobacco industry? -- the liquor industry?""",1423872000,7,392,5.078125

Children and adults will love this film.  I have seen it several times and could not believe how cheap it was to buy.  I don't know why they headline Bill Murray, George Clooney is truly the star here--Murray has a supporting role.  Nether-the-less, this children's story made into a film is one of the best ever.  The author of Fantastic Mr. Fox, Roald Dahl, also wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach and other favorites.  You can't go wrong with this classic.

I was so not expecting ANY of it. Normally I'm multitasking when watching a movie/TV but not this one. It just kept just me engrossed not knowing what was coming next. The animation was awesome.  Each character had it's own little personality and one thing just built on the last and it kept going and going. Very fun - I felt like a kid. I also really liked the ""extras"" on this DVD that showed the behind the scenes stuff and how they went about putting this story together. Crazy awesome brain that Wes Anderson has and what a great team to bring to life his vision.

Was in brand new shape.

3769242,2,B001QOGYBI,"I'm a big fan of most of Wes Anderson's work.. I'm not a fan of Moonrise Kingdom and I found Mr Fox a similar experience.. where he's trying too hard to make this work... It's not easy making a movie for 2 audiences at the same time.  I don't know, it just doesn't work for me.  I could see some children liking it.. Everyone has different tastes.. and I'm clearly in the minority here.
I think if you're not used to 'alternative' movies this will be a delightful entrance into unusual concepts... But if you're used to movies that use a lot of creativity (non-formulaic), I think you'll find this a bit trite.
To each his own... but this was a flop for me.

3769322,5,B001QOGYBI,"Again Wes Anderson's worlds unfurl to entertain in wonderfully detailed ways. I have not seen this for a few years. Now, also having seen The Grand Budapest Hotel, you see where some of the ideas might have sprung from. There are so many great moments in here, both in performance and animation. While I love what Pixar and other 3D animation companies have done, It's not often to see hand crafted animation such as this any more. This thing is just beautiful.

The behind the scenes are fun, and actually give you more appreciation of the mind numbing work that went into making the film. The next viewing is far richer understanding the lengths they went to in detail.

I enjoy movies that turn the ordinary on it's head. Wes Anderson is a mastermind of exactly this, so yes, I will naturally want to see his stuff. So, this might be a biassed review. If you enjoy the same type of oddity, then more than likely you will dig it too.",1417305600,2,935,4.461988304093567

However, if you are really sensitive to animals being eaten by other animals, you will want to approach with caution.  The main character is a fox, a fox who hunts, kills, and eats chickens.  I do not consider the scenes depicting the killing of chickens to be graphic, however we have had a farm for many years!",1413331200,,470,4.35632183908046

Though animated, it had the same look, feel, lighting, colors and perspective of other Wes Anderson films. It really is stunning. It also has that wit you expect from him and the loyal actors that work with him.

What didn't impress me much: George Clooney's and Merry Streep's voices. Did anyone else find them a bit bland?",1412208000,,423,4.794520547945205

3769654,5,B001QOGYBI,"There is something magical that happens when we watch a good quality stop-motion animated film.  We are instantly taken back to our childhood, when our imagination breathed life into inanimate objects like toys and dolls.  Perhaps exactly because it is hand made, we are even more intrigued by all the fine details in the sets, props and puppets themselves.  In its imperfectness, we know its not real, but we cant look away because its that intimate hands on creativity that puts aside our disbelieve for 90 minutes in order to enjoy its pureness.  Couple this with a great story based on a good book with superb acting and you have a formula for a perfect film.  Now I won't go much further regarding the specifics of the movie, as the overwhelmingly positive reviews for Fantastic Mr. Fox have done so already, rather I will discuss the merits of the Criterion Blu-ray/DVD edition.

I cant speak for all Criterion editions as Im sure they vary from release to release, however their recent blu-ray/DVD releases have been absolute gems in terms of packaging, artistic design, supplemental material, and of course the high quality high definition transfers and restorations that they are most known for.  In the home video world of mass produced, poorly designed Blu-ray releases, Criterion editions are refreshing, stimulating to look at, artistically engaging, and thoroughly engrossing for the movie lover.

For this specific Criterion edition of Fantastic Mr. Fox, one can appreciate the amount of collaboration and participation by the actual film makers.  Everything from the slip cover painting by Turlo Griffin to the booklet essay and movie commentary contributed by director Wes Anderson, you get the feeling you're owning a part of the cinematic world they created.  Its this intimacy born out of the careful and thoughtful design process by the professionals at Criterion that makes it worth the price.

Lets begin with the packaging designed by F. Ron Miller.  The slip case and interior disc holder contain paintings by Turlo Griffin, painter and conceptual artist from the actual film.  The color palette and style matches up perfectly with the motifs from the film.  The slip cover painting has a unique rendering of Mr. Fox and all the characters with fine details right down to the character shadows that extend to the bottom of the slip cover.  There are lots of interesting details on the disc holder as well.  From the mural painting on the outside to the acorn branches on the reverse side, everything feels connected to the film but yet artistically original.  Each disc face depicts a set or backdrop from the movie.  The insert booklet, a Criterion regular feature, includes set photographs by Ray Lewis, conceptual drawings and sketches, articles by Erica Wagner and Wes Anderson, and artwork from the fictional White Cape comic book which is featured in the film, drawn by Christian De Vita the Lead Storyboard Artist.

The meticulously designed packaging carries over into the Blu-ray menus, which starts off with the theme music and then quickly fades to soothing ambient noise paired with 3 alternating title  cards depicting backdrops from the movie.  The menus are so cozy and inviting that you could fall asleep to the menus while they play on loop in the background.  The new 2013 audio commentary provided by director Wes Anderson is a real treat, with the highlights being Wes explaining the various real life inspirations for the characters, designs and scenes that made their way into the script and film.

If you're the type of movie lover who watches a different movie each night, the Criterion package may not be the edition for you.  However, if you're the fanatical film enthusiast who prefers to watch a movie over and over absorbing the special features and savoring the details of the artistic packaging, then the Criterion edition of Fantastic Mr. Fox is highly recommended.",1406073600,,3922,5.0262751159196295

The only disappointment I had did not pertain to the movie itself but the digital copy would not transfer to my vudu account.

The director did a fantastic job animating and bring all the characters to life. I recommend this for all ages. Younger ones I don't think will understand the stubbornness and wittiness mr. fox has to offer. It'll def keep them busy. Adults will find it a fast 100 minutes and laughing all the way through.

Cinema is my life, tv I feel is overrated nowadays, so I'm happy to add ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" to my collection for decades of viewing.",1403568000,,633,4.610619469026549

The computer animation (or whatever it is called) appears low budget, but that is part of the charm and is on purpose, I think.  I love how they don't use actual cuss words, instead they use the word ""cuss"" in place of obscenities, ""the cuss you will!"" I can watch it over and over and find new reasons to enjoy it each time.",1402531200,,476,4.10752688172043
3769688,5,B001QOGYBI,"Ingenious.  Fearless.  Responsible Husband and Father.  Pure Class.  It is the inimitable, inspiring and slightly intimidating Fantastic Mr. Fox.

(Very mild spoilers)

The Fantastic Mr. Fox is just that:  FANTASTIC.  This is a classic gem of stop motion animation that should be in every father's movie collection.  The story may be a child's ( written by Roald Dahl ) but the humor is definitely adult.

The voice talent in this film is top notch.  George Clooney somehow makes Mr. Fox endearing even though he's kind of a jerk.  MERYL STREEP voices Mrs. Fox; who dreams she can reform the outlaw fox and steer him into a more respectable - I.e. safer - vocation.  Bill Murray voices Fox's best friend Badger, who works at the prestigious law firm of Badger, Beaver and Beaver.

It all starts when Fox has his midlife crisis at age seven (forty two in fox years) and becomes discontent with his lot.  Keenly aware that his own father died at only seven and a half, Mr. Fox decides that he is tired of living in a hole.  He moves his family to a pricey tree that overlooks the farms of the three meanest farmers in England.  Immortalized in a chilling little ditty sung by the local Human children, Borgus, Boggs and Bean are old nemesis's of Mr. Fox.  The three farmers and the reformed chicken thief/cider poacher Mr. Fox are set on a collision course when Fox spies an ad for a sale on bandit hats in the local paper.

I loved this film at the cinema and never forgot it.  Now that it is available on Blu-Ray I've watched it four additional times.  What gives this film legs, what makes it an animation classic is that you uncover some new detail in every scene whenever you watch it.  Who can resist Willem Dafoe as Bean's Psychotic Security Rat; a Ciderholic who carries a switchblade and moves like a Shark from Westside Story?  Brian Cox, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson help round out the cast.  Michael Gambon ( Albus Dumbledor ) is classic as a farmer ""skinny as a pencil, as smart as a whip and possibly the scariest man currently living.""

This is a film filled with witty dialogue that you will come to love.
Some of my favorites include:  Well, anyway... It's not half as bad as double pneumonia, right?  I mean, HIS dad has got one foot in the grave and three feet on a banana peel! and then there is the non sequitur:  That's just weak songwriting.  You wrote a bad song Petey! and my favorite, the frantic Mr. Fox:  of: Oh no!  Where did you get that Nutmeg Ginger Apple Snap?  And why are you wearing that fake bandit hat?!?

Believe it or not, you cannot help but love it when these incongruent gems of dialogue pop up.  You'll see.  This whimsical tale is just like Bean's Alcoholic Cider:  Tastes almost exactly like pure melted gold.",1402444800,3,2759,4.51417004048583

3769690,3,B001QOGYBI,"Visually pleasing and enjoyable, but I didn't see any need to add the word cuss in every few minutes.  I would not show it to young kids for this reason.  This is not a cartoon for teaching morals, but will teach you to steal and insert cuss.",1402358400,,242,4.127659574468085

The film moves along at a quick pace and while no one joke blows you away that fact the it remains funny from start to finish is an achievement that is seldom, well.....achieved!

The animation is quirky almost trippy, kind of like Robot Chicken and Adult Swim type stuff. The voice acting is also strong with Clooney, Murray and company giving the furry characters life. I may not have laughed so hard my stomach ached, but I had a smile on my face from start to finish and that doesn't happen often enough.

One of the best films I've seen. I've already watched it 3 times.

This set comes with one Blu-Ray disc, and 2 DVD discs.
The Blu-Ray disk works just fine, but unfortunately, the DVD disk with the actual movie on it arrived scratched, and is completely unwatchable.

3769725,2,B001QOGYBI,"Liked the book, but the movie deviated from the book to much and really changed/wrecked the story.  Not even good for kids.  The lead fox repeatedly says ""curses"" to suggest ""put curse word in here"".  Children over 8 will just insert curse word in their head.  If they wanted to leave out the curse, they should have simply done that!",1397865600,,334,4.516666666666667

3769731,4,B001QOGYBI,"My husband is a big Wes Anderson fan so he wanted to buy this movie to see if my 4 year old would like it and he loved it. This movie is so cool and has a great soundtrack. And best of all, it's gotten him into music from the 60's.  Now he asks to hear The Rolling Stones and the Bobby Fuller Four. Sure beats hearing ""Happy"" on repeat.",1397433600,,336,3.8
3769732,5,B001QOGYBI,I love this movie. My kids do also. Definitely made all of us laugh. I hope George Clooney will do more work like this.,1397433600,,119,4.0

3769735,4,B001QOGYBI,"After enjoying Grand Budapest Hotel and Moonrise Kingdom, I sought out more so I watched this movie on a plane using my Kindle Fire HD.  This was terrific!  Smart, clever, and the stop action animated characters added another element of interest to the film.  This is not for children, thankfully, so if you are one of those people who think it's beneath you just because it doesn't have people in it, get over yourself and open up your mind.  This is a sophisticated well written movie that really made my plane ride go quickly. It's engaging, fun, and well worth your rental.",1397088000,,577,4.627450980392157

3769737,3,B001QOGYBI,"...although Mr. Fox has finally, joined the prestiged lineup of Wes Anderson's masterpieces, the packaging for this set is different than the others. Most Criterion Collection blu-rays come in matching clear plastic cases, but this comes in a cardboard folding case complete with cardboard slipcase. It looks really nice on its own, sure, but it doesn't match the set. Part of the appeal of the Criterion Collection is how nice they look on your shelves. I'd like to arrange my whole Anderson collection in order of their release, but this one's packaging is so different from the others, it shatters the continuity.
Still, great film and wonderful content.",1397001600,,657,5.092592592592593

3769740,5,B001QOGYBI,"I am a Wes Anderson fan.  I have three boys ages 5, 7, and 9.  When I bought this DVD it as really just to complete my Wes Anderson collection.  Every film he's done I enjoy and watch repeatedly.  This film looked a bit childish but I decided to buy it anyway and watch it with my kids.  I'm glad we did.

A lot of family movies segment the characters into dialog that kids like with subtle jokes the parents get.  This film in NO WAY does that.  It is pure right out of the gate and tells a story that connects with both adult and child without any pandering.

I plan to go see Wes Anderson's, The Grand Budapest Hotel movie at the theatres but I have to say, I wish he would do another movie like the Fantastic Mr. Fox.  This is a brilliant film and leaves me wanting for more.  I highly recommend that you buy it.",1396569600,,816,4.0375
3769741,5,B001QOGYBI,"One of my favorite short stories as a child was ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" although it is a slight piece of work: well written, but short, and essentially a bent Peter Rabbit tale.

Wes Anderson takes this core story and adds an hour of new material to it, inventing family drama, witty dialogue, and wry anachronism out of whole cloth. And -- to my surprise -- not only does this not encumber the original work; it transcends it, adding a new depth of both meaning and humor to make the movie not just as good as my childhood favorite, but better.",1396483200,2,542,4.42
3769742,4,B001QOGYBI,"This is the movie where Wes Anderson ""righted"" himself.  Visually, it has served as a template for his two live action movies, and it also serves as a means for him to write cleaner, sparer, and sharper screenplays.  Clooney is perfect here - as are all the others.  The story is good family fare but will most certainly satisfy adults.  It's funny, suspenseful, and very original.  I highly recommend it.",1396224000,,405,4.728571428571429

3769749,5,B001QOGYBI,"I love this movie even more after seeing the special features on this Criterion Collection DVD! It's FULL of fun bits to watch George Clooney rustling around in the grass reading his lines, Wes Anderson acting out the ""West Side Story"" dance the rat (Willem Dafoe) does, a time lapse of how a full scene was created, and on and on. So worth it to see the behind the scenes view on an amazing film!",1395532800,,397,4.306666666666667

Weeks later, I couldn't explain it but I just could not get this movie out of my head.  I decided to buy it for her, and discovered that this Criterion release would be coming out soon so I figured I'd just wait for it.  It wasn't until later that I discovered that it was a Wes Anderson film.  I guess that explains why this movie stuck with me after only seeing parts of it.  Wes Anderson is the kind of director that - if his movie manages to get inside your head, it won't get out.

I chose to buy it now because I was completing an order for free shipping, and the price was low.  It was okay for the first hour, and then it just got tiresome with the added material not in the book.  The puppet animation was impressive, though, adding something beyond CG or regular animation.

Then, it clicked and the silly, not-taking-itself-seriously character of the movie started to get under my skin... in a good way.  The charisma of the cast (especially George Clooney) really drew me in.  I could totally relate to what Mr. Fox felt and what made him get into the sticky situations that sent ripples through his family's and friend's lives.

3769778,5,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox looks great on Blu-Ray and it appears that Criterion are using the existing one from 20th Century Fox. The colors are rich and vibrant with all kinds of detail yet still retaining a filmic look.

Introduction by Petey features the character voiced by Jarvis Cocker providing a brief and wryly amusing primer for the film.

There is an audio commentary by director Wes Anderson. He wanted to make Fantastic Mr. Fox because it was an important book from his childhood. He points out that the screenplay was written at the Dahl family house and the environment around it inspired many of the settings in the film. Anderson speaks briefly about adapting the book and also how the animation process works, including recording the voices. This is a very informative track from the engaging director.

Animatic allows you to watch the film in storyboard form.

The Making of Fantastic Mr. Fox is comprised of seven featurettes covering various aspects of the production. There is footage of the cast recording their voices for the film and it is interesting to see how committed they are (especially Clooney) to the roles. Also included are puppet tests and early animation that gives us a good idea of what the characters were to look and act like. There is a collection of photographs of houses and furniture for the art department to reference in the film. There is a fascinating look at various puppets being created in the studio. There is a time-lapse photography featurette documenting how scenes are painstakingly animated over days. Also included is a look at composer Alexandre Desplat working on the score. Finally, there is footage of many miniature objects used in the film. The attention to detail is incredible!

Roald Dahl Reads Fantastic Mr. Fox is an audio recording of the man reading his own book. It is always interesting to hear the authors voice and how they personalize their work.

Award Speeches features Wes Anderson voicing a puppet in stop-motion animation giving thanks for an award the film received. Also included is a potential speech if the film had won an Academy Award and a press statement by Mr. Fox that is done in amusing fashion.

Set Photography by Ray Lewis is a collection of behind the scenes stills of characters, props and so on.

Publicity Featurettes take a look at Roald Dahl and what inspired the script. In another, Anderson talks about how they expanded the book into a feature-length film. There is a look at the puppet makers and how they created the various characters. Also included is a look at the production design and how Dahls home influenced it. Finally, Bill Murray talks about his character, Badger, and praises the crews hard work.

Sony Robots Commercial is an animated ad that Wes Anderson created.

Discussion and Analysis features two kids talking at length about what they thought of Fantastic Mr. Fox.

Fantastic Mr. Dahl is an excellent hour-long documentary on the man that acts as an ideal primer on his life and work.

The Witchs Tree features vintage footage of Dahl and one of his favorite trees  the one that inspired Fantastic Mr. Fox.

Finally, there is Dahls Manuscripts: a selection of pages from his first 1968 manuscript of the book along with sketches he created to go with the text.",1392940800,5,3280,4.854838709677419

3769802,5,B001QOGYBI,"We first watched this with our 8 yr old son. We watched it again now that he's 12, and we all love it still. Aside from foxes killing chickens (non-gory) and farmers shooting at foxes, no violence. Just clever contraptions and banter.",1390435200,,234,4.595238095238095
3769803,5,B001QOGYBI,"Don't think that its a kids movie, I mean yea it can be, but it has humor for adults as well. I mean what the cuss just watch it",1390348800,,128,3.4482758620689653
3769804,5,B001QOGYBI,"With a feel similar to Life Aquatic, this film isn't just for kids. It's clever and witty, with jokes that will be lost on a younger demographic. I recommend it for adults who enjoy Wes Anderson's style - I think the animation gives him more flexibility in a way that the director seemed to love. I hope to seem ore like this from this director.",1390348800,,345,4.323076923076923

3769808,5,B001QOGYBI,"This movie is definitely worth seeing for both young and old alike. The characters are adorable and the animation is fantastic! The voice overs provided are lovely and the entire story is fun, touching and will keep you interested until the end. A lot of people I tell about this movie have never even heard of it. So please watch this and spread the word of this fantastic experience. :)",1390003200,,388,4.557142857142857

3769816,2,B001QOGYBI,"I rented this movie, because my 6 year old son read the book. The book by far is superior to the movie. I was expecting so much more with an All Star cast. I would definitely say that the humor is more for adults... But even with that being said- I prefer the book!",1389657600,3,265,3.925925925925926

3769822,5,B001QOGYBI,"Poignant, hilarious, entertaining... need I say more? This is a movie you can see with your children and yet the plot is clever. It is not vulgar (as, disgracefully, seems to be the case with most movies nowadays. The animation is phenomenal.",1388966400,,242,4.785714285714286
3769823,5,B001QOGYBI,"My niece and nephew said I simply had to see this movie. I downloaded it for an airplane ride. It was incredible. I was laughing all the while getting upset with the main character. The fox is rather, well, he does things that are plain stupid and costs the family and in turn all their friends to lose their homes. The warfare that results between humans and animals takes on a sense of extreme. I appreciated the meditative relative who comes to stay and of course, loved the happy ending.",1388793600,,491,4.466666666666667

3769827,5,B001QOGYBI,Wes Anderson films are brilliant and the Fantastic Mr. Fox lives up to its name because it is fantastic.  A darling tale that is sure to entertain people of all ages.,1388448000,,166,4.354838709677419
3769828,5,B001QOGYBI,"What does the fox say?  Well, if you're the one-and-only Fantastic Mr. Fox, you probably say, ""Comme ci comme ca.""  And maybe add, ""Click click.""  One hell of a trademark.

And it's one hell of a movie as well.  Supposedly, this film was adapted from a children's book, a book that I've never read, and a book that I probably will never read.  It's surely not the case that I don't like the story.  Far from it.  But it seems that this film targets more of an adult audience to me (where the book supposedly targeted children) since most of the humor surely couldn't be understood by anyone under twelve.  And I would guess that many adults won't get most of the humor either.

This is surely one of the most sophisticated animated films that you will ever see, and one of the funniest, and one of the cleverest.  I've seen it twice now, and I think that I actually liked it more the second time than the first, which is unusual.  But not as unusual as this film.  You have complete anthropomorphism going on here, which is surely not unusual.  But even more than that, you have humans taking on animal characteristics too (note the humans' decision making being driven by base emotions where Mr. Fox always tries to at least stay level headed) and therefore you will most likely root for the animals here over the humans.  I surely did.

Films like ""Shrek"" -- at least the first in the series, as it in particular started going off the rails during the sequels (whenever babies are brought into a story, a franchise ""jumps the shark;"" just ask the cast members of ""Friends"" if you don't believe me) -- are really good.  But this one kicks it up a notch, and it makes you realize that those films were written for the masses.  If you wanted to nitpick a bit, you could say that this film was not directed at the masses.  But I would say that that's a good thing.

But perhaps the only real weakness in this film, a weakness that Mr. Fox admits himself (and I'm paraphrasing a bit):  ""My biggest weakness is wanting to be special, wanting to be better than everyone else.  It gets me in trouble.""  But I would respond, ""No reason to apologize, Mr. Fox.  When you're really good you never need to say that you're sorry.""  But I might add, ""Click click.""",1388361600,,2251,4.418491484184915

3769830,5,B001QOGYBI,"I had not heard of this movie until my college age son recommended it. It has become a new family favorite. It's funny, quirky, touching and such a great story line. It's really appropriate for any age, but definitely geared more for the adult mentality.",1388188800,,254,4.666666666666667
3769831,4,B001QOGYBI,"Charming, witty, funny, offbeat, and truly unique. You will be hard-pressed to find another film with the same sort of energy and humor this film has, with some truly wonderful characters and a plot that, while very kid-friendly, is full of all sorts of subtleties that parents will love too.

Getting both the Blu-Ray and DVD in one package for such a low price is a great deal, and while I never really use digital copies, it's nice to have that as well.",1388102400,,456,4.493975903614458

3769834,5,B001QOGYBI,"This is a quirky little story (a la Babe) that is told in a wonderfully artistic and splendidly acted way.  Nothing but grade A character voicing from some of the best in the business (George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon to name a few).  The film is brought to life with stop-motion animation (the style of films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, and Chicken Run), and requires a level of meticulous artistry that very few possess.  Everything about this film is a treat...truly unique and wonderfully individual characters, a charming tale, even the music in the film is endearing.  Fun for kids, and a rare gem for adults who appreciate animated films.",1387670400,,676,4.95575221238938

It's beautiful with all the ticks and thoughtful touches. The details alone are enough to make you wanna watch up close. In PJ's, with the bother of popcorn and a friend or two you'll be entertained by a story to touches on family, middle age, redemption, quirkiness of youth, being true to oneself, and the mischief of being an individual.",1380931200,,496,4.77906976744186

For adults, the mixture of humor, depth, sarcasm and yes, cuteness, is intoxicating.  Like life it's not cookie cutter, and doesn't have pat answers, but has wonderful characters that we like anyway despite their flaws - because their virtues so outweigh the flaws.  We watch it again and again and always find new things in the movie to ooh and aah at.

Also, in the book, Mrs. Fox adores her husband and tells her children over and over ""Your father is a fantastic fox."" In the movie, she is much less encouraging. Also, the children in the book are happy and sweet. And in the movie, they only have one child and he has so many issues.

Sat on a blanket in front of the TV, popped pop corn, and enjoyed the movie.

There is enough humor in this adventure for both kids and adults alike.

It might have a bit more violence than some families would care for (guns shooting animals), but with a bit of discussion one can make this a learning experience, too.

3769882,5,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is an amazing film, the experience was tarnished when I couldn't even watch it because according to amazon there were too many streams of it when I only had the one. I ended up having to stream it for free from another site.",1377993600,,242,4.282608695652174
3769883,5,B001QOGYBI,"This film is one of my favourites.
I have been a fan of Wes Anderson since I was young, and saw Rushmore for the first time.
He's an impeccable filmmaker and I was actually just telling a friend today that this film redeemed him from the disaster that was Darjeeling Limited.

The aesthetic, the humour, the heartfelt moments, the action, it's all perfect.
The acting is great, the animation is spotless, and it's incredibly well adapted for the screen.

Normally I'm skeptical about adaptations for books, but I didn't hesitate with this one at all.
Definitely watch this film, you will not be disappointed.",1377734400,,608,4.836538461538462

It looks like they were trying to get as many well-known people as they could to do the voices of an animated flick.  Not a good story.

It's so much fun, and silly and Wes Anderson's style seems particularly well suited for stop animation. Everything that I didn't think worked in his other films seems to work here.

I purchased the BluRay, DVD, Digital Copy version which is a great bargain considering the Digital Copy is an actual disc and not a code that expired like you run into with some Digital Copies.

3769931,5,B001QOGYBI,"I can't emphasize how much our family enjoyed this move.  The kids liked the nonstop action.  I really enjoyed the fact that by using animals to convey the story, Wes Anderson takes a close look at human dilemmas and existential problems.

3769932,3,B001QOGYBI,"It's an interesting story, and done in a very interesting way--it's really going to be an individual decision. I liked, it, but wasn't stunned. My wife loved it. It's based on a Roald Dahl story, so it has that going for it, if nothing else.

3769933,5,B001QOGYBI,"On a recent long-distance flight, I gorged on a bunch of movies.  The one that blew me away was this one.  I'd heard and known about the inventiveness of The Fantastic Mr. Fox's stop-action animation.  What I was not prepared for was the script: it is sneaky smart with elements of both understated humor and outright hilarity.  Nor was I prepared for just how brilliant the vocal characterizations were.  I hope George Clooney got some type of award for this film, because, wow, what a performance.  The character he gives his 'Mr. Fox' -- hard to put your finger on exactly how he did it, but his mere voice gives our hero equal bits of dash, street smarts, world-weariness and hope for a better future. Bravo.

Three memories which had me doubled-up with laughter on my flight:

The tree-, er, house-buying strategy session with badger (and lawyer, natch) Bill Murray - the ""Are you cussing with me""? scene - which quickly devolves into animal behavior until a well-timed 'ding' off the carriage return of Murray's deadpan secretary defuses the hostile atmosphere.

Owen Wilson's inimitable intonations dispassionately rattling off the arcane rules of the sport of 'Whackbat.'

Clooney's Mr. Fox having a understated breakfast conversation with his wife (an equally sublime performance from Meryl Streep), concluding his point in very human-like fashion, then...ravenously demolishing his waffles like you'd imagine a fox doing given the opportunity. An unexpected, burst-out-loud funny moment.",1367280000,,1497,5.2259414225941425

If you've read the book and haven't seen the movie you will wonder how they could turn this short story into a full length movie.  Of course they added more story-line and while I usually hate that sort of thing the writers did a great job.

3770005,5,B001QOGYBI,"I love Wes Anderson movies because they refuse to be anything other than life, which is comic and tragic at the same time.  This is no genius statement, obviously, but it doesn't show up in a lot of movies, except classics, which I'd rate this one.

I haven't read through all the other reviews, but I'm sure you know the plot and all that.  I watched it to see if I could use it for a class I'm teaching, looking for that ""theme"" you have to hit when you're a teacher in this climate.  (Fun is not allowed in the college classroom.)  A grand theme is there.  I hate looking for metaphors in literature, a fool's game, but when hit on the head, well, and done with a very insistent feather, a metaphor doesn't hurt.

The animals are the underclass, which we get all along, because they wind up way, way underground, trying to just get by, trying to make it with no-income jobs, finally living in the sewers that are ruled by the white rich uberclass.  But of course the underclass survives by theft and pure glee at the prospect of living.  Through scavenging various cultures.  And most of all, through love and companionship.  The movie is as fun and engaging and technically wonderful as everyone says it is, but I do love the subtext a whole lot.  It is all true for us in the lower 98, percentile, that is.

Oh, and I about fell down when I saw that the voice of the Rabbit is Mario Batali.  He is of course an Iron Chef, and one who specializes in cooking, among much else, rabbit.  Irony is not dead.  It just smells funny.",1357171200,,1530,4.315789473684211

Wes Anderson has a view of the world that gives it a tweak on the cheek, a laugh that questions and a troupe of actors/actress that bring his world to fruition without bombastic acting.

I remember Roald Dahl stories from my childhood as well as the wonderful stop motion animation but this movie blows my mind.  Not only is it a great piece of nostalgia, but the dialogue and the ""acting"" is so wonderful, you forgot you're watching puppets.

I thought the addition of saying cuss instead of any cuss word was really funny. I would show this movie to kids. It wasn't offensive or obscene or very crude.

3770050,5,B001QOGYBI,"Every once in a while a film comes along that just hits all the right notes. This one is a film in that category. Beautiful. Not much needs to be said except you need to see the stop motion on this one and the voices and story are absolutely stellar as well. When you take into account how hard these films are to produce then you get an idea just how much work went into this. Each character has a distinct personality and humor. The Fox family is totally spot on as far the characterization goes for this type of film.

That people give this one star show, inextricably, the laughably sincere nature and awful taste of many Amazon reviewers. In one such review we find the critique that one cannot further 'suspend their disbelief' because of the increasingly crazy nature of a film.... about anthropomorphic foxes and rodents. Ummmm. Yeah. You can tell the other people in this one star category are as imbecilic and unappreciative of art in the same way. It is actually quite hilarious to read their reviews and makes for a good time although I now digress....

This is grade triple A good. So many memorable locations and scenes. SO many memorable ways in which the art direction wows the audience. Easily of the better stop motion animations of out time. I find it very hard to rank Anderson's output more so than just about any director because each film, mostly, is fascinating and on par just in different ways. This is still one of his most accomplished works if nothing else. The bluray, while not being a super high bitrate, is a joy to watch unfold and you should do yourself a favor and rent or buy it as it is a keeper in every way.",1352937600,,1647,4.450331125827814

The humor is complex and exactly how I like it - a little adult without anything downright inappropriate (my favorite is the use of the word ""cuss"" in the place of any obscenities - as in ""this is going to be a total clustercuss""). The visuals/sets are stunning and oddly soothing (Wes' choice of warm colors is flawless and well detailed). The story is hilarious, the characters are wonderful and the voices are perfect. Bogis, Bunce and Bean are a riot just as much as the animal characters.

I laughed out loud several times while watching this, didn't want it to be over and continue watching it on a monthly basis almost two years after first seeing it! Highly recommended!",1351728000,,737,4.575757575757576
3770053,2,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) is for unguided children and adults nostalgic for return to childhood's classic loved books ..two profitable target audiences!

Nobody not already acquainted with the famous Roald Dahl authored children't book would seek out or put up with this movie.

It doesn't stand on it's own.

It's a ""nostalgia vehicle"" cashing in on a famous children's book.

It has a ""name brand.""

Performers of fame and advancing old age (George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray....... all the stars are over 50 or 60) like projects like Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) because ""voice over"" work is easy and quick.

The main stars likely spent a day...two at the most...""doing"" this movie.

No cameras, no costumes, no memorizing lines and scripts......just read the printed word you hold in your hand and likely never saw before an hour or less prior to your voice over performance.

Wear comfortable clothes. Do it all sitting down. Get paid big and get it over with fast.

Nice work if you can get it, and George Clooney, Meryl Streep, and Bill Murray ""got it."" Good for you guys. You all deserve the money and glory you got....nobody ever gets enough of those things, including you!

But a great, or even a good movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox is definitely not.

It's for people not raised on true and worthy children's classics....people who read the ""pop,"" best selling commercial children's authors big in middle and late 20th Century America and England.

Judy Bloom (""Blume?""), Dr. Seuss, and Roald Dahl.

Kiddy sections of public libraries are packed with the books of these best selling, no-qual authors.

I love this movie, the characters are interesting and flawed which does not make this the normal animated movie. It may be fun for children, but I think it's the adults that get a kick out of this one.",1350864000,,332,4.370967741935484
3770056,5,B001QOGYBI,"At least 20 words ahahaha. What it is this highschool? Anyway. So FMF came out on my birthday, which I'm always excited to see something creatively animated that comes out on my birthday. And then it's also a Wes Anderson film, and I am a huge fan. So going in I had very high expectations about the movie. Amazingly all of them were met and it has earned its place among my all time top ten favorite movies.

Though I must say, before this movie I had never read any Roald Dahl books before hand, I had only ever seen movies based on his books (James & The Giant Peach, Matilda), but after watching this I wanted to read the book. Fair warning, there are significant differences between the movie and book, namely the amount of agency given to female characters in the movie as opposed to the book and also the rounding out of characters in the movie as opposed to the book. And in all fairness the book it targeted towards children and children don't need a lot of back story as long as the main story flows and carries interest, which it does.

I believe that this movie is geared towards people who read this book in their childhood and now would appreciate a more fleshed out version of the story, seeing as Wes Anderson himself said that FMF was the first Roald Dahl book he read as a child.

And if you haven't read the book but are a fan of Wes Anderson, like myself, this is still wonderful Wes Anderson storytelling, complemented by a fantastic cast and a beautifully thought out soundtrack. The puppets used for the animation are beautifully made, and I cannot wait for a chance to get my own physical copy of this movie.

FYI: since this is a digital copy, I totally recommend just making sure you download this to your kindle and turn the internet off when you plan to watch it, because omg, amazon player LOVES to make you use the cloud copy and not the one on your device if the internet is on. keeping the internet off takes away a bit of wait when watching it.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy/ed this movie just as much as I do.",1350777600,4,2039,4.327225130890052

3770059,5,B001QOGYBI,"We previously owned Fantastic Mr. Fox in the DVD version and with both the adults and children in our family watching it repeatedly it certainly seemed worthwhile to upgrade to Blu-ray. This movie is visually so enjoyable, and my children who are very into making their own stop motion videos love to pause and see some of the techniques employed so perfectly in this movie. The Blu-ray only enhances what was already a great film. The actors, the story (it is Roald Dahl after all!), the wonderful lines that bear repeating time after time; we love it all. I wish there were more just like this. If you enjoy Wallace and Gromit, or other Aardman films then you are probably going to be a fan of this as well.",1349827200,,709,4.503875968992248

3770061,4,B001QOGYBI,"Love this movie! It's not like anything I've ever seen before, which is probably a good part of why I like it. :) It's full of off-the-wall humor, without being totally bizarre. The wonderfully detailed stop-animation is fascinating. The story is fun and family-focused, with many touching moments. And it's an interesting study on anthropomorphism - we see a character struggling to reconcile the instincts of being a wild animal with the morals and inbuilt conscience of being quasi-human. Mr. Fox sums himself up pretty well: ""I think I have this thing where everybody has to think I'm the greatest, the quote unquote ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" And if they aren't completely knocked out and dazzled and slightly intimidated by me, I don't feel good about myself.""

The one and only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is the inventive use of the word ""cuss"" - the characters use it several times throughout the film, in place of language ranging from mild to downright vulgar. I appreciate that they didn't put any actual language in the script; but at the same time, it's a little too easy to ""fill in the blank"" and I find that irritating. :/

You won't find a movie quite like 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' anywhere else. If you're like me and appreciate ""random"" and ""different"", you'll enjoy this one. After all, in the words of Mrs. Fox: ""We're all different.... But there's something kind of fantastic about that, isn't there?""",1348963200,2,1430,4.808943089430894

3770072,5,B001QOGYBI,"I haven't read Roald Dahl's book that this was based on, but if this movie is anything like it, I shall definitely be picking up a copy at some point in the future. Charming is an excellent word for the film, which has all the lyrical quirkiness we've come to expect of Anderson and his films, whether it be Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Aquatic Life, or his latest effort, Moonrise Kingdom.

Besides its quick pace and wit -- and the feeling that it's packed with about 3 times the plot of many live-action films today -- it also has a great voice cast in George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, not to mention some talented unknowns. The writing is funny, insightful, and clever, and again moves at a breezy clip, just like the movie.

The style of stop-motion animation is another high point. Its feel and costuming seems to recall stop-motion techniques from films back in the 1940s and '50s, a kind of retro look that you might get from some of the haunting short animated films of that age, whether it be from artist behind the iron curtain or from the imagination of George Pal (later the creator of blockbuster films like Destination Moon, War of the Worlds, and The Time Machine).

Either way, this is a film you can watch with the entire family and come away enthralled.",1346544000,,1292,4.584415584415584
3770073,5,B001QOGYBI,"When we meet Mr. Fox he's in a bind - he and Mrs. Fox get caught in a trap and she tells him she's pregnant and he promises never ever but never again to risk his life taking from farmers.  He'll get a respectable job, as a columnist for the local paper, but two years later (12 in fox years) they have a misfit teen and a visiting cousin and Mr. Fox is feeling middle aged and anxious, and itchy for the danger and criminal excitement of stealing poultry.

He's a wild animal at heart, he insists, not made to settle down into age and oblivion.  He comes up with a plan, and along with his friend, the possum plumber, plans one last heist, not just any heist but the big one, stealing from the fiercest farmers around: Boggis, Bunce and Bean (you know: one fat, one short, one lean, but uniformly mean).  They don't take it lying down. Mr. Fox's carefree and careless indiscretions turn into an all out war between the farmers and the animals, and everyone will have to work together and set aside rivalries and resentment and hurt feelings.  The danger is real, and they take unnecessary risks, but they have a lot of fun and adventure along the way.

I really dig the quirky and stylish vibe of the irresponsibly fantastic Mr. Fox.  Voiced by George Clooney with flair and a fancy whistle and a click, and animated in a silly and stylish retro stop motion approach.  It's a very fun film, and my wife and I loved it and laughed out loud, a lot, but so did our kids (and so, apparently, did lots of others who couldn't stop busting up or exclaiming around us in the theaters).  The film's got something for everyone, and stays true to the feel of Roald Dahl's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tale/dp/0142410349/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tale</a>&nbsp;while giving it the whimsical feel and quirky delights that can only be found in a Wes Anderson film.  The retro-stylish clothing and settings and the family dynamics, especially that between a larger than life but aloof father and a struggling son (played perfectly by Jason Schwartzmann), fit easily into his oeuvre.  I loved the look of the film, the delightful attention to detail, the colors and lighting were perfect, and the deliberately low tech touches, where you could see the ruffling hair and wobbling of water, just add to the charm.

and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon.

A fox/father decides to settle down, stop stealing chickens and become a  respectable newspaperman, but hitting a mid life crisis the part of
him that longs to steal birds can't be denied one last big heist,  which leads to ever more dire (and funnier) consequences.

I liked the film on first viewing, but found I loved it on the second.  First, for film fans, or fans of Anderson's work, it's hysterical how he has
translated his personal style, both visual and character, to animation.  This looks and feels like his other films in a way that is by itself an
absolute crack-up.  But more important it turns out that Anderson and Dahl are a great mix, with Dahl's great imagination taking Anderson's
cock-eyed view of life, and expanding it to a broader canvas.  In the end, while populated by puppet animals, this is as human, touching
and funny as almost anything Anderson has done.  It may be too sophisticated for little kids, but any child advanced enough to enjoy Dahl's
books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.) should have a grand old time, along with their parents.

While the Criterion is clearly the best release in terms of extras, the picture quality on the much cheaper standard release blu-ray is also excellent, so the cost factor is worth considering.  That said, I traded up to the Criterion, and was happy I did.",1344124800,2,1575,4.771217712177122

3770087,4,B001QOGYBI,"The writers and especially George Clooney breathe new life into this animated version of Roald Dahl's book.  Animated in a sense but really old school stop-motion puppetry.  Foxie (Clooney) is supposedly retired from his wild animal days of stealing chickens and the like.  Unknown to his wife (Meryl Streep) he's slipping out with a new buddy and into his old ways.  A timid son and a nephew play into the mix along with a hoard of other wild critters.  The film moves along, has some interesting bad guys (human and animal), and provides the usual moral theme.  One thing that is repeated is...""these are wild animals and this is what wild animals do"".  Nice flick by Wes Anderson; wacky and weird but not like his live action film which I have mixed feelings about.",1334275200,,768,4.686567164179104
3770088,5,B001QOGYBI,"This is a great adaptation of a classic story. I read Roald Dahl's books as a child, and though people often forget, movies based on books aren't always meant to be identical. While it may not mirror the book, the film is witty, entertaining, and the animation is incredible. As a lover of stop-motion, I was amazed by the texture and movement the animators and puppetmakers were able to create, the characters really do come alive.

If you're not a fan of the director or his style, you probably won't like this movie, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its own place in the world. Taking it on its own merit, as opposed to comparing it to the book, it's an enjoyable movie, one I find myself coming back to again and again.",1334275200,2,728,4.432835820895522

3770093,3,B001QOGYBI,"This movie gets under way with everything going for it. Star-powered voicing features George Clooney, Merryl Streep's lovely low tones, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and more. Stop animation has made huge strides even in the age of CGI, and can provide some of the most innovative and engaging imagery around. Basing a movie on a Roald Dahl book certainly won't hurt it, either - look what Dahl parentage did for 'James and the Giant Peach', the various Willie Wonkas, and lots of others.

So, with all this going for it, the movie just didn't thrill me, and I'm not sure why. The animation, though thoroughly competent, rarely rose above competence - but did so nicely in the ""digging"" scenes and in any involving smoke. Characters grated on me, especially Mr. Fox himself, who I found irredeemably self-centered, the kind who tends to reward friends' loyalty with some pretty poor behavior. Also, I'll happily go along with a forestful of critters in educated professions and snappy tailoring. Within that context (and within his sharp-looking leisure suit), Fox's claim to being a wild animal rings false - unless ""wild"" means something more like a frat party than like a jungle.

So, I kept the characters at arm's length, and the artistry wasn't enough to pull me in. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm in no rush to see it again.

3770095,5,B001QOGYBI,"The Fantastic, Fantastic Mr. Fox

It is without comparison that Regency Enterprises and Indian Paintbrush present to a us a the thrilling adventure of Fantastic Mr Fox. This picture that can only be described with one word, fantastic! The book portrays a simple message of excitement and fun that the movie does a phenomenal job adding onto. George Clooney and Merly Streep give the light to a problem that children never think of, ""Where is my life going?""

There vivid voices make kids laugh with jokes that their parents who are accompanying them actually get. A common theme showed in the movie is expectations, how Mr. Fox had amazing expectations for what he would do with his life but has not accomplished a single one. This is all part of the plot about foxes who formerly stole from three mean farmers who are now their neighbors, the temptation is so high to steel again that they can't resist and find themselves in trouble along with many of their animal brethren.

Fantastic Mr. Fox's stop motion design has yet to find a worthy
competitor with its complicated and intricately designed characters and scenery. My favorite scene would probably be the waterfall scene when Mr and Mrs Fox explain to each other their problems, while surrounded by elegant falling water that encompasses the hole screen.
The only bad thing about this movie would have to be that is too short, the audience leaves dying to continue this marvelous tale.",1326240000,,1443,4.834008097165992

3770098,4,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a pretty good film but the animation takes some getting used to.

Apparently using some kind of stop motion, the star-studded voice actors and the story is quite fun to watch though I thought it went a little bit long for a family picture.

Mr. Fox and his girl are aces at raiding hen houses and farmers are not too happy about it.  When they find themselves in an inescapable trap (which they do escape from), Fox promises never to do the old henhouse stealing ever again.

Except one day, years later, he just has to do that one last job.  That one last job, in three parts, to hassle the worst humans ever.  With the help of a possum, they make their moves undetected.  Meeting the disapproval of his family he promises never to do it again.

Too late!  The human farmers are the epitome of bad manners, obsessive dolts ever.  The story gets into their efforts to root out the foxes and destroy them.  This is where the story dragged for me.  The antics of the farmers and how the animals fight back is fun, but could have been trimmed down a bit.

Themes:  The themes of accepting who you are (after you find out what that is) was an interesting lesson in humility and personal fortitude.  I enjoyed that a lot.  And I think kids watching this will get that too.  It's OK to be different rather than pretend to be something you're not.

I did enjoy the way the animals lived like people - the athletic field, the complex rules of some sport games, the parodies of lawyers and crazy corporations - but it tries to cover too much.  An edited approach I think would have been better.

The film is based on the story of the same name by Roald Dahl.

The animation is charming and perfect for the story and the humor is witty, sarcastic, and at times hilarious. I'm not one for long reviews so I'll leave it at that, but I definitely recommend it to anyone from 9 to 90.",1325116800,,336,4.435483870967742
3770100,2,B001QOGYBI,"We were looking forward to seeing this film with our kids, but just couldn't like it. Our dislike of the movie doesn't come through an inability to enjoy Wes Anderson, as we have seen and enjoyed ""Rushmore"", ""The Life Aquatic"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", and ""The Squid and the Whale"".

I couldn't help thinking what a dull movie it would be if one just replaced the animal heads with human heads.  To us as diehard Dahl fans, the movie failed to capture the spirit of the book... it winked at the adults too much and really did not speak to children.  The main characters were prettified and yet charmless. The dialogue... meh. It was kind of a generic rom-com but because the characters are animals, it must be for kids, right?
As a children's movie, may compare with Pixar, but really not in the league of Aardman Animations or Miyazaki. But then again, what is?",1324252800,,862,4.584415584415584
3770101,5,B001QOGYBI,"Wes Anderson's wonderfully offbeat, awkward, and deceptively genius humor comes to full form here, in a film directed with a younger audience in mind.  Believe me when I say that I didn't see it coming, either, but exceptionally eccentric director may have found his calling card with Mr. Fox, which is a witty, creative, and razor-sharp adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic short story.

Although envisioned in a fascinating stop-motion form that is both complex and simple, Anderson's story is told with depth and human emotion, not to mention with a humor that is immediately recognizable by longtime Anderson followers.  However, what makes Fox so much more than the sum of its parts is the startlingly cohesive nature of Anderson's vision and the freedoms of the animation that come together with such grace.  They were simply made for one another, even more so than Burton and Depp.

With so much charm, it's easy to overlook the all-star cast, but it took the talents of Schwartzman, Streep, Clooney, Defoe, Murray, Wilson, Blanchett, among many others, to match Anderson's pitch-perfect comedic timing.  Every character is wonderful, forming to their character perfectly, to an extent where you forget the actors themselves and see each little animal for what they are:  Unusual, deceiving, and ultimately hilarious and eerily human individuals.

There's really nothing to discourage you from seeing this film; it's hilarious, clever, impeccably paced, accompanied by a good message, and one of those few films that stands up well to multiple viewings.  The only real question mark is where Anderson draws the line regarding mature humor and immature entertainment; the two get mixed in the process, and the results are mixed for the toddler audience - in layman's terms, don't take your children to a film expecting golden age Disney animation.

That said, for everyone else, Fantastic Fox is a huge breathe of fresh air, even in the midst of such films as Pixar's masterpiece, UP.  It's worth every penny, and is a serious contender for best animated film of the year.",1324166400,,2076,5.112426035502959

3770111,3,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox HAS to be the weirdest animated film I've ever seen. Right from the very beginning you will be surprised and perhaps even sickened by the way the husband and wife fox characters communicate with each other.

A good portion of the animation is really strange though, and that's no lie. Strange in a ""What in the world just HAPPENED?"" kind of way. One minute two adult foxes are pretending to talk to each other like a real life husband and wife couple, the next they're frantically digging holes and trying to escape with their lives upon realizing actual people are trying to destroy their habitat by tearing up the forests and ground (and eventually realizing the foxes need to be eliminated which results in more digging and hiding by the animals- this is a constant theme).

These foxes actually have personalities and actual problems that are, once again, similar to people. Something about the way the foxes move their lips is really funny and bizarre, but the biggest problem with Fantastic Mr. Fox is that the husband in particular tries to be funny but almost *never* is. Every attempt at humor that comes out of his mouth just stinks.

I admire the somewhat large and diverse variety of forest creatures (side characters) that happen to be friends with the fox family, but I don't know, I just didn't find this film particularly humorous and most of the jokes were severely hit and miss.  Most people seem to really like it though so perhaps I'm all alone in this regard.  To me, Fantastic Mr. Fox is just extremely bizarre and that's about the only quality it has going for it.",1315526400,3,1605,4.677304964539007

I ordered it on Amazon for 9.99 (BLUE RAY) and received in less than the time I was contacted by the local store.  Not to mention they wanted to charge me x3 times the amount!!! Thanks Amazon  ;),1315526400,,413,3.880952380952381
3770113,5,B001QOGYBI,"I knew nothing about this movie before I bought it.  All I knew is that it came highly regarded, was based on a Roald Dahl children's book, featured George Clooney, and was a creation of Wes Anderson.  With that combination, anything can happen.  So, I gave it a whirl.

When people talk about art, what makes good art is something that affects you in a way that nothing else ever has.  That is what this movie is.  Like mismatching wallpaper, or sacarine tastes, this movie will make you taste something that you have never tasted before, and see color and object combinations that your eyes have never seen together.  So, like excellent bitter coffee, at first you'll wince, and then you'll ask for more.

Now, I have to say, I'm not exactly sure that this movie, despite being an animated movie, is for young children.  There are some scenes of questionable nature that I would wait until my child was at least in their tweens before I let them watch it.  But that's just me.

Just so that you know what it is about, the first 1/3 of the movie is about the main character, Mr. Fox - a daredevil, wise-cracking, and stubborn local fox, who used to live a life of stealing chickens - settling down with his adorable mate - once she announces that she is pregnant with their first child.  It fast-forwards a couple years, to show him plotting a way to get back into the chicken-stealing business without his mate finding out.  Sort of like living the old days.

The second 2/3 of the movie is all about those repercussions - as he takes on three vicious and vengeful farmers all at the same time.  They (all the main characters of adorable local fauna) spend the last hour trying to outsmart the farmers in a tit-for-tat game of one-up-manship.

The story is good.  The animation, visuals, and sound are excellent.  The interaction and character play is awesome.  All trademarks of a Wes Anderson movie done with the best of the best talent in actors and techinical people that we have.

About what I said above about it might not be suitable to younger ages, if you saw ""Chicken Run"" from the early 2000s, then this movie is very much like it.  You have a fox who is trying to kill chickens, turkey, and other prey, while the farmers are trying to kill him.  So, while there is slaughter, it happens off-screen, but it still happens.

3770117,4,B001QOGYBI,"I'll admit that I'm not exactly a fan of Wes Anderson's movies. The only film of his that I've seen is The Royal Tenenbaums (at age 16 when it hit theaters), and when I worked at a movie store, his other films were constantly being brought up by a bunch of hipster kids that would refuse to watch anything 'mainstream'. So when it was announced that Fantastic Mr. Fox was going to be directed by Anderson, I was a bit worried. Fortunately, this movie had me hooked within the first 10 minutes. Not only is the movie interesting, but it has gorgeous art direction, fantastic voice acting by everyone involved, and the animation is rough. Normally I'd be disappointed by that, but the style matches everything perfectly.

Mr. Fox is basically having a mid-life crisis. When the story starts out, he and his wife are caught in a cage when on a run to steal chickens from a farm. After finding out that they're going to have a child, Mr. Fox promises that if they make it out of the cage, he'll stop his ways and live a safer life. He does so, for a while at least, making his living as a newspaper columnist. But once the family moves into a new home and he discovers 3 farms run by 3 of the meanest men out there: Boggis, Bunce and Bean. The urge to live dangerously kicks back in, and he quickly raids them of their chickens, geese and apple cider, only to be tracked back to his home, which puts his family and the other animals nearby in danger. At the same time, his nephew Kristofferson has moved in, and is making his son Ash jealous in every possible way, mainly because Kristofferson is perfect. Things look bad, but Mr. Fox always has a plan, and needs to try his best to figure out how to take care of the 3 farmers.

One of the best things that the movie has going for it is that it doesn't talk down to the audience, and that it can be viewed by people of all ages. There's a little bit of violence from short fight scenes and guns, but I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood, even when someone gets scratched by another animal. I loved that the animation style was on the rough side, and not fluid like The Corpse Bride, as it just feels right for the movie. Fur and clothing move from frame to frame, a process that the crew calls 'boiling', and was picked up from the original King Kong. Every major character was interesting, and this is one of the few movies where I was cheering for the main character from start to finish. Little mannerisms of characters, from trademark whistles and clicks, to the sudden savage growling when eating a meal...it's all great. The tone of the movie stays the same too- it's light and comical. That might also be my only complaint. Everything's taken so lightly that there wasn't much of a threat from the 3 farmers, even at the very end where the climax is over just as quickly as it began. At the same time, it would've been odd to make things dramatic all of a sudden, but I would've liked more time with the farmers and seen just how mean they could be, instead of the leader of the bunch getting a few small outbursts.

The special features are on the light side, with under an hour of material to go through. You get the standard trailer, a minute long fake documentary on Whack-Bat, and a couple of featurettes going over the making of the movie and a short interview with Roald Dahl's widow, who genuinely praises Anderson and the crew for making a movie that she thinks her husband would've approved of. I enjoyed the 40+ minute behind the scenes look where you get a good idea of just how time consuming stop motion is, even if you're already aware of how much time goes into it. One animator reveals that to film an 18 second scene, she spent 8 or 9 days on everything. That's just crazy, and I have nothing but the highest respect for the animators, puppet makers, set and prop designers...everyone. It was also great to see how they recorded the voices for everyone: going on location to a farm, with one microphone around everyone at the same time. If the characters in the movie were out of breath after running, the actors would be too, and it makes things much more real. It'd be nice to have a commentary track on here, but I guess this is one of those cases where the director lets the film speak for itself.

I highly recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox to fans of animation or anyone looking for a unique family movie. The whole movie is a visual treat, with all the autumn colors, and it features a fast paced story that never drags on. I just might check out Anderson's other movies now.",1312675200,,4558,4.371462264150943

3770120,5,B001QOGYBI,"This movie was amazing in every direction.

The animation was second to none.  I don't know how many people worked on it, but they didn't get enough credit.  Fabulous movement of the creatures, the settings where rich and amazing and the creation of smoke and froth (rabid hound) were awesome.

The humor was top shelf.  The use of ""cuss"" as a swear was awesome.  Whackbat is as creative a game as you can get, and perfect b/c it makes no sense.

The characters were great.  They were all so deep and interesting, with their own little quirks.  I feel movie characters are not unique enough and they run together, but not in this movie.  Granted, a lot of the characters were different species, but they all had something about them that made them unique.  Very well thought out by the writer.

The actors who did this were superb.  If I hadn't been told it was George Clooney as Mr. Fox, I would have never known.  It's as if he really got into the character and allowed the character to manifest itself through him, not the other way around (such as Ellen does in Finding Nemo).

The soundtrack is very entertaining.  It fits perfectly with the movie and the scenes.  It never overpowers what's happening, just adds to the scene.

Ok, so it must be addressed.  This movie does not follow the book at all.  There are a couple similarities between the two (mainly the names of the characters and the fact that the farmers are after the fox), but it is it's own unique creation.  In my opinion, it is head and shoulders above the book.  And, yes, to answer your question I read the book a week or two before watching the movie and found the movie to be so much better.",1311638400,3,1667,4.432343234323432

*Spoilers within*

Wes Anderson's films are traditionally quirky and full of complex themes, and his adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox is no different. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's animated (stop motion); this material is not targeted at children.

When we join the story, Mrs. Fox (Streep) is telling Mr. Fox (Clooney) that she's pregnant. The two proceed to rob a chicken farm and narrowly escape capture. Mrs. Fox makes him promise to look for other work now that they are about to become parents. Mr. Fox agrees and finds a job writing a newspaper column.

Mr. Fox settles down in his new life, but always regrets giving up his old ways. He's also tired of living in a hole in the ground and wants a better home for his family. He goes to see Badger (Murray), who advises him about properties for sale in the area. Fox wants a house near three local farms, but Badger suggests that the neighborhood is too dangerous. The local children even have a rhyme about the farmers:

Boggis, Bunce and Bean
One fat, one short, one lean
These horrible crooks
So different in looks
Were nonetheless equally mean

Fox is aware of the danger, but yearns for his former chicken-stealing days. As Anderson regularly reminds us, these are wild animals. Fox can't deny his nature and buys the new house so that he can be close to the three farms.

His decision goes directly against his promise to his wife and that was his first mistake.

There's a lot of humor in the film, but it's generally quite subtle. The family sits down to eat dinner and they eat like wild animals. The food is gone in seconds. Their son, Ash, is moody and craves attention from his father. He spits on the floor when he's angry or disappointed and he clearly has problems. When his cousin Kristofferson comes to stay, the situation worsens. Fox seems to favor Kristofferson over his own son and compliments him constantly.

Forget that we're dealing with animals for a moment and think about the story. If that happened in a regular movie, we would be dealing with a typical family drama. Husband and wife break promises and have trust issues, while their son is being raised by parents who don't understand him. This is not the kind of story that small children would understand, although some of the scenes are funny and contain action that would appeal to a child.

Fox enlists the help of Kylie Opossum and the two steal chickens from Boggis. The action is typical animated fare and the way the two sneak around is funny. They lace blueberries with a sedative to get past the dogs and the way the dogs react is also funny. They successfully steal from Bunce and plan to stop once they steal cider from Bean. For the final robbery, Ash wants to come along. Fox won't let him, but allows Kristofferson to take part. He seems to have very little idea that such a decision could hurt his son's feelings.

The robberies are fun to watch, especially when the animals wear bandit hats. It reminds me of the robbery in Bottle Rocket when the participants decide to wear similar hats even though their victims have already seen their faces.

Ash yearns to be an athlete and wants to emulate his father's success at Whack-Bat (a game which parodies cricket). Kristofferson is a balanced individual who regularly meditates and knows karate. Ash is extremely jealous of his cousin and his ability to win his father's approval.

The three robberies annoy the farmers, so Bean (Gambon) decides to organize the trio and plans to kill Fox. This is where the film starts to take on a more serious tone. Mrs. Fox discovers that her husband has been lying to her and scratches his face in a fit of temper. This scene annoyed one of my friends who expected the film to be lighthearted and suitable for the whole family. Mrs. Fox acts like the wild animal she is. There's another scene in which one of the animals is maimed. Although it's presented in a humorous way, it could disturb people.

The remainder of the film deals with the three farmers finding ways to threaten the existence of Fox and his friends. They escape by tunneling deeper, but face the threat of starvation if they don't find a solution. Some of the other animals resent Fox for putting them in such a dangerous situation.

There's considerable peril which could worry small children, and a lot of humor which would probably fly over their heads. It was only given a PG-rating, but be aware that not every child will like this harsh world. The animals are true to their nature.

The reason I like the film so much is the style of humor. Like Bottle Rocket and The Darjeeling Limited, the characters speak with a sense of irony or sarcasm and most of the humor is tongue-in-cheek. It feels similar to Tarantino or the Coen brothers at times. There's no swearing, but every character uses the word ""cuss"" in situations in which they would normally swear. I found that particularly funny. One animal questions why a ransom note was made using words cut out of a magazine when everyone already knew the identities of the kidnappers. That's also funny to me. The missions all have elaborate titles and remind me of the way Tarantino uses chapters in his stories.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is an exercise in style. Mr. Fox himself is very stylish, dressing smartly and using his trademark whistle when he thinks he's being clever or cool. Clooney was a great choice for the part and the other actors all do a good job too.

The story is essentially about a dysfunctional family and shows how Ash attempts to come to terms with his existence. Will Mr. Fox eventually become a better father? Will Ash grow up and take responsibility for his own actions? Do Mr. and Mrs. Fox strengthen their marriage, or will the trust issues tear them apart? There's a lot going on beneath the surface.

Video Quality 5/5
The look of Fantastic Mr. Fox is virtually flawless. The frames were shot digitally with a high quality camera and the detail is superb throughout. You can see every hair on the puppets and the stitches in their clothing. Some scenes look deliberately flat when shot from a distance and the color palette is full of brown and yellow tints, but that's all intentional too. I didn't spot any errors in a single shot and the presentation looks as good as anything I've seen.

Audio Quality 4/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track has its moments, despite the quiet nature of the film. Most of the story is driven by dialogue, but there are occasional bursts of sound in scenes involving music or explosions. The rear speakers aren't used prominently, but there's no cause for complaint overall.

Fantastic Mr. Fox has a lot of intelligent humor and subtle charm and it's clearly aimed at adult audiences. I wouldn't rule out showing the film to children, but be aware that wild animals sometimes show their true nature and their world can be brutal. I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's work and this met all my expectations in terms of style and humor. It's one of the most complex and unusual animated titles I have seen and recommended for fans of subtle humor. The world is an interesting place to visit and the film is a lot of fun if you go in with the right expectations.

3770127,5,B001QOGYBI,"Wow. I cannot believe that there are any 1 star ratings for this, but alas, some people are the kind of ""different"" that is not fantastic.

Granted this may not be your kids' cup of chocolate milk - especially if they are the same kids that like mindless trash like Power Rangers.

The Fantastic Mr. Fox is for all ages and it is the perfect package of imagination, wit, whimsy, and heart. Yes, the story is simple, but it's the execution that elevates it into something special.

To call the graphics poor is a great insult especially when it is very clear that the intent was not to reiterate the same artistic style that defines a majority of 3d animation today. The look is rustic, slightly messy, warm, and frankly refreshing. The artist in me appreciates it in every way. The music too, beautifully compliments the movie and is emotionally complex.

The movie explores topics like individuality, responsibility and consequences, and most importantly, compassion for family and friends. I love how they managed to juggle in all those wonderful bits around a story about food and survival (as a foodie, I can certainly understand the drive to attain fresh tasties lol)!

I can honestly say there are no faults to be found. It is liquid gold.",1308268800,,1245,4.74537037037037
3770128,5,B001QOGYBI,"To be sure, anyone expecting Wes Anderson's interpretation of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" to be a faithful retelling of the classic by Roald Dahl may not find what they're looking for.  Instead, what the viewer will find is Wes Anderson being Wes Anderson -- only animated.  It is not necessarily a children's film -- in fact, my kids bored of it quickly -- as much of the dialogue and nuances are more adult in nature.  However, for adults who grew up reading Roald's books and who enjoy the almost vintage quality of Anderson's films will genuinely enjoy it.  The stop-action animation quaint and adds to the whimsy of the story.

As a fan of Wes Anderson already, this film is definitely one of my favorites.  However, if you're not necessarily a fan of his previous work, you're looking for something more family-friendly, or you generally shy away from book to film interpretations, this movie may not be for you.

I saw an ad for it a few years ago and just got around to watching it tonight, I say that because the ad didn't look that exciting either.  Horrible writing is what it boiled down to, it was visually appealing but the entire time I just felt like it was trying to be cleaver in the dialog but just never got to a intelligence level above a below average 10 year old.  It also was cast very poorly, none of the voices added anything to the characters.

Like I said I didn't expect much but usually when I go into a movie like this I get more than a bargained for.  This movie was just dull and drug on and on for what seemed like ever.  I would NOT recommend buying this unless you rent it first and for some odd reason end up liking it.  I had heard that young kids don't like it, it is hard for them to sit through a long unfunny movie, and it is not witty in anyway so I confused as to who this movie was aimed at.

There is one odd part of the movie, I don't know if it was in the book, where Mr. Fox has a dialog about a wolf he sees in the distance.  I think it is supposed to be significant in some way since it just does not fit into the story.  All I can think of is George Clooney is an environmentalist which I don't know for sure since he is such a horrible actor and I don't follow him.

The film comes off weird, but a couple minutes in, you'll be loving the whole vibe. The oddness of the characters, the animation, and the music all gives it a tone that you think would be off putting but is one of the most refreshing takes on a movie in a while.

Mr. Fox (Clooney) promises his lovely wife (Streep)that he will stop stealing, in light of getting caught red handed. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and small parts from Anderson usual's, Murray and Wilson make up the extraordinary cast. The characters are unique and develop throughout the film. Mr. Fox is a animal trying to find freedom from his boring, monotonous day, and Badger is a hot-headed lawyer. The writing is top notch, and never gets boring, and the music is perfect for the movie. There is constantly ambiance noises (they recorded voices outside in a forest) like birds and crickets. But best of all is the animation. The whole film is brought to life by this.

3770148,4,B001QOGYBI,"I'm not going to pretend I went into The Fantastic Mr. Fox with expectations in any feasible direction.  I never read the classic book on which this film is based but had vague knowledge of the book's existence as ""one of the other books from the guy who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach"".

Next up comes the realization that the film adaptation was the result of director Wes Anderson's creative vision; a style that, love it or hate it, is undeniably unique.  With past films like Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, about the only common thread I could find was appearances by Bill Murray (and in that regard The Fantastic Mr. Fox continues the tradition).

This is the story of one Mr. Fox and the conflict within him between being a responsible family ""man"" and the chicken-stealing wild-ways of his past.

Despite making a promise to his wife that the life of thievery is a thing of the past, Mr. Fox decides, as part of his mid-life crisis, that he must try ""just one more raid"" on a trio of intolerant farmers (Boggis, Bunce and Bean).  The sad reality with recovering addiction is that ""just one more"" easily becomes a returning lifestyle and Mr. Fox realizes this only after it's too late.

And while the action serves as the catalyst to move the plot along, the core of this tale is satirical family life (personified through animals) of Mr. Fox (George Clooney) wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep), their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and visiting nephew
Kristofferson Silverfox (Eric Chase Anderson).  It is this dynamic that provides the film's greatest charm by staying close to the moral lessons of the original tome coupled to Anderson's trademark off-brand wit and style.

And in keeping with the Wes Anderson brand of style, the visuals, this one forgoes fancy Pixar/ DreamWorks-esque 3D computer animatics for traditional stop-motion technique. And not unlike Aardman's works with Wallace and Gromit or Chicken Run, there is undeniable charm to be found in this method.  Once the viewer adjusts to the intermittent rhythms and the scruffy (almost ultra-realistic) look of the model textures, the wit, beauty and emotional undercurrents contained here are stunningly apparent.

The pacing, heck even the themes and satire are undeniably adult oriented however.  Does this mean foul language, sexual themes, or gore? Absolutely not.  Anderson's work is an all-age friendly class act all the way.  However, it's definitely still debatable as to just which age will make the most of the experience here.  The visuals may be strong enough to keep the kiddies involved but it's the sociological and family interrelationships that really define this piece.

Entire case studies have been conducted in effort of defining the various themes and underlying issues that author Roald Dahl confronted in his writing and many of these ideals transfer brilliantly into the film: Concepts like our inherent inability to ever fully let go of our youth or the battle between industrialism (represented here by the farmers) and nature.

The vocal work is spectacular as is expected from such a deep cast and the Alexandre Desplat soundtrack makes use of an excellently appropriate selection of pop music.

In all it's tough to come away from this film without some appreciation of Anderson's ability to combine the classic material with his own sensibilities.  And while his past films may suggest this as a trait that can go either way, rest assured that Fantastic Mr. Fox retains the very best of what Wes Andersen has to offer: Intelligent wit, impeccable timing, and just enough homage to early-filmmaking techniques to be labeled charming.",1299542400,,3711,5.014657980456026

Box-office figures tell me I'm the only one out there, but I'm just so, so, so sick of 3D computer-generated animation movies bogged down with slapstick/bathroom humor, flying objects and the voices of the same comedians over and over.

Unfortunately a couple of things kept me from giving this a higher ranking. I found it disconcerting that the animals had American accents and the humans had English accents. This is obviously an English countryside story so an all-English cast would have worked better for me. The narrative, about a married fox who can't resist returning to crime after years of a respectable career as a journalist, was OK, but I didn't find myself profoundly concerned. Put it this way: If the DVD hadn't played properly, I wouldn't have stomped up to the video store and demanded another disc so I could see the ending.

Though animated, I wouldn't call ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" a children's movie. The morality is too ambiguous and the humor too adult. I don't mean that it's particularly obscene or vulgar or morally reprehensible; it's not. It's just that most kids aren't going to appreciate this film. When I told my kid that we'd rented it, he said to watch it after he went to bed because he'd already seen it and hated it.",1298332800,2,1537,4.774436090225564

The first two acts are really clever, warm and quirky, then the third drags on forever. Anderson brings along his usual cast of collaborators, who once again pull a miracle by feeling right at home in the new characters' skins, and the handful of new additions fit right in alongside them. George Clooney is perfectly cast as the slightly shady, endlessly charismatic lead, Willem Dafoe provides a great cameo and everyone's performances seem to key off of that shared energy. This was mostly charming and wholly entertaining as a goofball throwback to the old school of stop-motion animation that's sure to get better with repeat viewings.",1297987200,,732,5.008196721311475

3770157,4,B001QOGYBI,"The good:

* The animation is really rather wonderful. If you are grew up with the old Rankin & Bass classics every Christmas and Easter and/or are a fan of the weirdness of Tim Burton, then I think you'll like this. It is fairly ""jerky"" but I think that's just a part of its charm.

* The blu ray is crystal clear. You can see every hair on each animal, every leaf on every tree really stands out etc. The clarity of the picture is just fantastic.

* I actually quite liked George Clooney!  There, I've said it!  A lot of people hated him and felt he was just being lazy and revising his Ocean's 11 character but I thought he was actually quite good and really suited the part of the cheeky Mr Fox.

The bad:

* The whole film is shot in oranges and browns and that's pretty much it. There were a few night scenes that had a nice rich blue but otherwise, I felt, it was lacking in colour. Other people might feel that that too is just a part of the film's charm but I had to go outside and stare at my lawn for a while to remember what the colour green looks like! So it may not hold the attention of young kids for too long.

* The character of the animal children are voiced by adults. Now that may not bother some / most people but it did bother me. The character of Mr Fox's son Ash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) was just creepy! I just think children's characters should be voiced by ... well ... children.

* The character of Rat (voiced by Willem Dafoe) might be too scary for littlies especially when he pulls out a flick knife. Rat also refers to Mr Fox's wife as ""the town tart in her day"". Try explaining that to your kid when they turn to you and ask ""what's a town tart?"" ...

The ugly:

* The constant (and irritating) use of the word ""cuss"". Here's an example of just one scene (Mr Fox has an argument with his lawyer Badger (Bill Murray)): ""I'm going to ignore your advice"" ""The cuss you are"" ""The cuss am I, are you cussing with me?"" ""No, are you cussing with me?"" ""Don't cussing point at me"" ""Don't cuss with me you little cuss"" ... And this is just one scene. Believe me - it's right through the whole film. I mean if you're going to swear, then swear but this really isn't appropriate in a film aimed at children.

* Here are a couple of lines that I was very surprised to find in a movie aimed at children: ""Those farmers aren't going to quit until they've got you and every member of your family nailed upside down to a bloody stick with your eyes gouged out."" and ""But at the end, he's just another dead rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese restaurant.""

I gave this four stars because I actually quite liked The Fantastic Mr Fox but if I had known about some of the lines in it, I would not have let my 4 year old watch it.  This is really a quirky film for adults rather than a traditional film for kids.",1296432000,5,2832,4.116152450090744
3770158,5,B001QOGYBI,"...and had Mr. Fox merely done so, he would have avoided all of the problems that follow him and his family deep into the ground he worked so hard to rise above by writing a column for a newspaper that he constantly wonders if anyone actually reads.  Writing a newspaper is simply not in Mr. Fox's true nature.  He does possess one skill very much in his nature, but he has promised his wife to never steal chickens, geese, turkeys, or squab (whatever they are) ever again.  Had Mr. Fox simply listened to his lawyer, voiced by none other than Bill Murray, then he would have avoided a number of irresistible temptations to his animal nature.  Unfortunately for his family, Mr. Fox cannot stand the undignified feeling of living in a hole...

Such are the idiosynchracies of writing a summary of almost anything Wes Anderson writes and directs.  His unique approach to developing characters and putting witty and nuanced dialogue in their mouths often overwhelms a plot as simple and straight-forward as this, but these are exactly the strengths in which fans of Wes Anderson revel.  And his smartly quirky take on family dynamics is alive and well here just as it was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Royal-Tenenbaums/dp/B0000640VJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-Aquatic-with-Steve-Zissou/dp/B00005JNLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Darjeeling-Limited/dp/B003KGBIS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Darjeeling Limited</a>.  I genuinely believe that with ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Wes Anderson elevates the family film genre with a story that distinctly character-driven.

It would be criminal to overlook all the attention to detail invested in the design, crafting, movement, and even the wardrobe of the physical puppets.  Like many, I have grown increasingly weary of computer-generated images and animation.  That was the main reason&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Team-America-World-Police/dp/B0007Y08IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Team America: World Police</a>&nbsp;was so refreshing to see; real and tangible objects responding to natural lighting.  Such is the appeal here.

Wes Anderson's films tend to appeal to those, like myself, who really want to see something different.  Those looking for action and excitement crammed into a film like a can of sardines will probably not appreciate a Wes Anderson outing.  But if you like subtlety, nuance, and humor that is character-driven rather than dueling one-liners one can get in any television sit-com, then I can whole-heartedly recommend this and any of this filmmaker's work.",1295913600,,2840,6.397905759162303

The ""kids"" sounded like little geniuses and I especially liked the way that, when the characters ""cursed"", instead of saying the four letter word, they would say CUSS! (You would have to see how they do it in the movie for this to make sense.)  The teen angst and competition between the young fox cousins is so cute.  The interaction between Mr. Fox and his wife is good too.  Even though I own the dvd, every time it's on cable, I watch it!",1295827200,,553,4.392156862745098

My husband was asleep in no time and I picked up a book to read after about 45 mins.  I did not like that the colors of the clothes and setting were all about the same shade.  I did not think the characters were interesting.  I kept waiting for a reason to care about a restless fox that wants to hunt chickens.  We gave up and shut it off.  I am so glad I did not buy this one.,1295222400,5,473,3.7755102040816326
3770161,2,B001QOGYBI,"I love Wes Anderson films. The Royal Tenenbaums is possibly my favorite film (if not, it is in the top three). I think he is a fantastic and meticulous director who creates works of art.

But I just don't think his genius is appropriate for a film ostensibly for children. I appreciate his commentaries on modern ennui and depression and money never being a solution to your problem in his other work--yet I just don't think that I would want to show this film to anyone. For children, it is too depressing. For adults, it caters to them with plenty of clever jokes and wit and charming hand crafted animation (which I loved) yet it falls short of really having heart.

I rented this from Netflix due to reading varied reviews, and I for one am glad I did not buy it. It has a great cast, a great director and great craftsmanship. But for me, as I watched it--it has no heart. It felt like Anderson wanted to make a story he loved as a child into a film, but he is ill-equipped to make a children's movie. I think he should stick to what he knows and does wonderfully--black comedy adult films that examine the spiritual and actual problems of well-off people in America. I know a lot of people loved this film, and I wanted to too. But I just don't.",1294704000,2,1250,4.337606837606837
3770162,5,B001QOGYBI,"`Fantastic Mr Fox' is a delightful stop animation film based upon the Roald Dahl book of the same name. The first half of the film remains relatively faithful to the original storyline (with the addition of a few new characters) but the second half takes it in a slightly different, but no less satisfying direction. Essentially Mr Fox steals various farm produce from three unsavoury farmers who then go out of their way to hunt him and his family down to kill them. Mr Fox is as cunning as a....well a fox, and he finds various ways to outsmart the farmers and amuse us in the process. This has numerous animation touches that made me laugh out loud and made this an especially enjoyable film and the overall animation is excellent throughout. The voice cast is very impressive and well matched to their respective characters and the direction was truly superb. The soundtrack which pretty good as well. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would and after hearing some disappointing things about this film (generally from fans of the book) I was pleasantly surprised with the high calibre of film making on offer. The best way to gain the most enjoyment from this film is to view it as a separate entity to the book and if you do this you will be in for one wonderful, humorous and spell binding film experience.

3770163,5,B001QOGYBI,"A fantastic film and a standing ovation for American animation. Wes Anderson is a known quirk in the film world, and this take on a beloved childrens novel could possibly be his greatest work, next to Tenenbaums. The Plot is easy enough, fairly well explained by the quick amazon synopsis. Fox is lighthearted, it has its own atmosphere to it, with oddball quotes that make you smile no matter how stoic you are at the office. Clooney, Streep, Murray, all animals come with a thick stroke of character, so you'll always come away with a character you love ( Coach Skip being mine ). Children may not understand how quizzical the film can be at times, and at points topics become too collegiate, but generally they'll think the animation's cool, and at least you'll ""get"" it. The animation is simply fun! Stop-motion has always been a difficult process, and there's a deep satisfaction taken from watching mister Fox prance around on screen, and knowing that you personally created that. The dancing is amazing, silly, and fast paced. Every movement in the film has a quick pace to it. Theres a sing along song that'll make you crack up. As far as the score, it gives great movement to the film, and keeps the scenes fun loving, sometimes to be taken seriously, and occassionally speed driven. All in all, its a well balanced, quirky, film with a neccessary moral, being different is okay, live it up, enjoy life, and enjoy this film!",1294444800,,1433,4.713147410358566

Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorite childhood books, and as is often the case it's hard to separate the book from the movie. The book is short, whimsical, and, quite simply, fantastic. To make a movie they had to add so much stuff that they should have just called it something else. I might have enjoyed the movie if I hadn't read the book so many times.
The biggest disappointment is that since Roald Dahl grew up in Wales and England, in my head the characters always had British accents. The way he writes is definitely English, not American. The voices (and dialogue) in this movie are awful!",1294444800,14,672,4.516393442622951

3770166,5,B001QOGYBI,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It proves that you can have a family-friendly movie without dumbing down the content.  This thing is totally kid-safe but it is NOT written for children.  It doesn't simplify matters.  The plot is simple, but the characters are complex.  This movie doesn't condescend, and I found that to be incredibly refreshing.  Another neat thing I noticed is the movie's ""timelessness.""  The stop-motion animation is technically impressive (masterfully done; some of the best I've seen) but it gives a nostalgic, almost antique look to the production.  It's not slick CG-rendered stuff; it looks old.  I think this movie is going to date extremely well, since it does not seem to be strongly tied to the present.  I expect it to be just as good twenty years from now as it is today.  There are no fart jokes, no incongruous pop-culture or current-event references, no contemporary Top 40 singles embedded in the soundtrack.  It's very clean, very self-contained within its own world.  I consider that a plus.

The humor is that sort of understated, character-driven style that fans of Wes Anderson will appreciate.  The voices are not typical animation-style performances, but it all works extremely well, making the characters convincing and relatable.  The pacing is fast, but it feels slow because of what the director chooses to spend time on.  Overall a very quirky and surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Older adults will enjoy the story and the interaction of the characters.  Very young children will be captivated by the cute talking animals.  However, it's likely that kids 10 - 16 years old will find this movie terribly boring (re the absence of fart jokes and ""cool"" stuff as mentioned above.)  It's unique and extremely smart - maybe too smart to appeal to the demographic that animated films are generally _supposed_ to be for.  Fans of animation as an art form MUST add this to their collections.  I hate to use the phrase ""instant classic"" but I have never seen a film more deserving of that epithet.

The film is almost more geared towards adults than children with it's dialogue and themes but the furry animals give the children enough to keep their attention.

3770182,5,B001QOGYBI,"...and it's Wes Anderson at his finest.

So what's the movie about?  Well, it's a simple story about a fox who's trying to overcome being what he is (a wild animal) and rise to be something better (noble father).  The fox who steals chickens, geese and cider has to eventually arise above his own selfish scams to save his family from some crazy farmers who have more ammunition than brains.  It's a relatively well-worn story idea with a lot of layering, character, and execution that either you love or you hate.

This movie is HILARIOUS, but it's a different kind of humor.  There's no kicks in the crotch, no swearing (although they say the word ""cuss"" where swearing would be...genius!), no sex, no off-color or sixth grade humor.  This movie is made for people who appreciate subtlety and clever dialogue.  This movie is made for people who think that lateral (i.e. random) humor is actually funny when properly executed; think Monty Python without the ADHD.  If you're looking for a movie that your family can watch, this is it.  If you're looking for a movie to watch with your college philosophy class that you can analyse the tar out of, this is it.  If you're looking for a movie to watch late at night with your sweetheart and you're both too tired for something heavy, this is also it.

Wes Anderson has the ability to make films that function on so many levels and yet are thoroughly entertaining for almost anyone.

Top quality voice acting by Hollywood's finest and visual color and texture that is almost strange to see because it's so original.  I would never have thought that I would have loved a serious movie made with stop motion animation, but Wes Anderson pulls it off and makes it great!

Highly recommended for all.",1289088000,3,1742,4.665573770491803

  Mr. Fox has chosen to give up his life of bird stealing in a promise to his wife and becomes a newspaper writer. After leading a very dull rest of his life he decides to purchase a new house and soon gets caught up in his old ways when he discover's he lives near three farmers. After the farmers realize what is going on they decide to retaliate and attempt to kill Mr. Fox and his family. Check out ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" to see their fight for survival.

  Witty dialogue and a very comical style of animation really set this movie apart from others. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is amazing and has a superb cast which really help tie this masterpiece together. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature, and Best Original Score at the 82nd Academy Awards and lost to Pixar's animated film ""Up"". As I watched this movie I was amazed at how much character was portrayed in these animated animals. The crazy eyes of Kyler Sven Opossm and the trademark ""whistle and click"" of Mr. Fox are just a couple of the little touches that really bring out the character's in this film and really instill them in your head.
  The voice acting in Fantastic Mr. Fox is phenomenal with great actors such as George Clooney (Mr. Fox), Meryl Streep (Mrs. Fox), and Bill Murray (Clive Badger). The comedy in this movie never seems to run dry. I let out some really good laughs during the movie, and it is pretty funny to see the situations Mr. Fox gets in and how he handles them.
I did not read the book, I didn't even know it was based on a book, but I would say it does the book well. This is a great movie and can for sure provide entertainment for anyone.
I give it a 9 out of 10

3770184,5,B001QOGYBI,What can Wes Anderson not do?  His adaptation of Raold Dahl's book is at turns visually arresting and brimming with wit.  The humor here is subtle and inspired.  I wouldn't recommend this film for younger children not because there's anything to offend a parent's sensibilities but a lot of the material would be over their heads.  This is an adult film but not in the restrictive sense.  Anderson challenges his audience with this film so it's best suited to the intelligence of older children and adults.,1289001600,2,506,4.837209302325581
3770185,4,B001QOGYBI,"This is a fantastic movie! It's interesting funny and witty for adults, but I think kids will understand a more simplistic plot and find it equally enjoyable. The characters cuss a lot, but instead of saying the actual words, they say the word ""cuss,"" which I'm pretty sure is better for this kids.",1288310400,2,298,4.6415094339622645
3770186,5,B001QOGYBI,"The Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't a roll of the floor funny type film, but it is one of the funniest films I've seen all year. The film moves along at a quick pace and while no one joke blows you away that fact the it remains funny from start to finish is an achievement that is seldom, well.....achieved!

The animation is quirky almost trippy, kind of like Robot Chicken and Adult Swim type stuff. The voice acting is also strong with Clooney, Murray and company giving the furry characters life. I may not have laughed so hard my stomach ached, but I had a smile on my face from start to finish and that doesn't happen often enough. The DVD transfer looks great, but the extras are pretty bland.",1287446400,11,692,4.364341085271318

In this Wes Anderson work, the art of stop-motion animation is at its finest. Fantastic Mr. Fox, voiced by George Clooney, and his wife (Meryl Streep) romp through the adventures of his reckless thieving ways. With intentional adult humor masked for those of the younger set, both young and old alike will enjoy the sly Mr. Fox and his court of characters.",1285804800,2,513,4.711111111111111

This has to be one of the worst movies ever created.  It was so boring I could not even make it through the first half of the movie.  The characters are flat and unmemorable.  The voices were uninterested and almost seemed bored themselves.  There really is no plot or purpose to the movie.  No wonder it did so poorly in the box office.",1283040000,9,478,4.363636363636363
3770194,5,B001QOGYBI,"When I saw previews for this film in the theatre, by wife and I exchanged eye-rolls.  So when I borrowed a friend's copy out of sheer boredom with the current panoply of predictable, music video children's films, my expectations were low.  In fact, we began this film close to the kid's bedtime so I'd have a reasonable excuse to bail out early.

Well, the kids loved this movie and so did I.  It's wonderfully paced, the animal characters are idiosyncratic and immensely likable, and the dialogue is conversational and amusing.  I don't like when an animated children's film includes a stratum of adult innuendo.  That, to me, is targeted marketing, and those carefully distributed oblique references that make mom and dad chuckle exist to compensate for a weak story.  No gimmicks here.  Funny situations, cleverly crafted characters, technically superb animation, and a novel story.

Look, just because objects move fast on the screen for and hour and a half and gets your adrenaline pumping, doesn't mean it was a great movie. The movie also didn't have a heart to it. It felt emotionally cold. O.k. in a cartoon world we can argue that a fox doesn't show emotion because they are crafty, but there was something seriously lacking in this movie. There wasn't any real substance to it.  I say it's slightly below average.  Tom C.",1281830400,2,574,4.39622641509434

That said, I can't stop watching ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"".  The animation is fascinating, the voices are perfect, and the writing and vibe are pure Wes Anderson.  On every subsequent viewing, more details come to light.  The expressions on the faces of the characters, the way they eat (you'll have to see it), etc.  Can't stop watching.  Every wordless gesture invites repeated viewing.  i.e., something as simple as Kylie shrugging his shoulders and grinning caused me to watch it over and over.  Same with Ash turning to look at the camera after a redemption of sorts.

Some of his friends like Badger (Bill Murray) and others are in danger as well for they must try to survive and find a new place to stay.

Based on Roland Dahl's underrated book, this lives up to the title and is THE best animated movie of 2009. Now ""UP"" was very good but this is even better as it has more emotion, more unique characters and a better storyline. The film co-stars Owen Wilson and William Dafoe, this movie is a nice break from CGI as being more old fashioned stop motion animation from writer-director-producer Wes Anderson who does his first animated feature. This is a brilliant animated movie mainly for adults but all ages can enjoy it, i wish it could have won best animated movie of the year but oh well, this is a must have for animation buffs.

This from a child who, if she likes a film, asks to see it over and over again.  She loves Horton (Hears a Who), Up, Kung Fu Panda, and the Bizard (Wizard) of Oz.

3770201,4,B001QOGYBI,"Roald Dahl has left a long legacy in children's literature. Many of his works have been turned into movies, including: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory/Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, The Witches, plus James And The Giant Peach. Revered director Wes Anderson went an extra step further for making this film the first fully-animated adaptation of one of Dahl's books.

Set in the British countryside(even though most of the cast has American accents!), Mr. Fox has to give up his life of stealing from farmers to start up a family with Mrs. Fox. A few fox years into it, their son Ash is going through his akward teenage phase while resenting having his cousin Kristofferson moving in on his territory at school. Mr. Fox decides though to move his family into a new place, while at the same time planning heists on the three local major farms with his new landlord possum, Kylie. After somewhat successfully strealing from them, the ex-Nazi owner of the cider ranch that Fox stole from plans to go WWII on his ass by attacking his new home. After he and the other two farmers run them out, the Fox family heads for the sewers along with the rest of most of the forest critters. The animals then dig under the farms and totally wipe out their stock. The farmers retaliate by flooding them out into the sewers, and eventually capture Kristofferson thinking that he's Ash. Fox then leads a rescue mission to get Kristofferson back with Ash and Kylie. The Fox family then make a new home underneath a supermarket which happens to be owned by all the farmers.

This movie mixed stop-motion animation with computer effects pretty well, especially since it was done by Henry Selick, whose wizardry includes his own movie Coraline, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Selick also worked on the animation for Anderson's The Life Aquatic. I was very suprised with the detail given to the animals' fur and expressions. There are times when the characters seem slightly out of place, like the 4ft. rat that worked for the farmers. Plus, they never explain why the regular forest animals wear clothes and can talk, while the other animals like bloodhounds and wolves are just regular animals. I was suprised though at how much good criticism this film got, especially from critics who aren't normally fans of animation. I thought it was in all a good movie overall, although not as funny as it could have been at times. Despite its charm, its not totally a movie for the entire family, but is truly one for the ages, and I have to say I'm impressed with its look at old fashion style for a modern day production",1279584000,,2605,4.723076923076923
3770202,4,B001QOGYBI,"""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" really is a smart and witty, fun and entertaining family movie written by two of our most intellectual film-makers (Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach), adapted from the Roald Dahl classic.

When Mr. Fox sees the dangers in raiding farmers' livestock (his curiosity causes him to trap him and his pregnant wife) he becomes a newspaper columnist, only to eventually realize that raiding farmers' homes is a far more nobler calling (as a former journalist, I agree completely with his assessment).  His raiding angers the farmers, who begin a massive foxhunt, forcing him and his fellow animals deep underground, then into the sewage system, and then finally into the worst place of them all -- a modern supermarket.

George Clooney does a terrific job of voicing Mr. Fox, and if I had not learned that Meryl Streep was in the movie I would have thought the casting perfect.",1279324800,3,888,4.906666666666666

3770207,5,B001QOGYBI,"If you're a fan of Wes Anderson, this should fall right in line with what you would expect from him. Quirky, colorful, unique, and fun! This movie although based on a classic children's book is more intended for a mature audience. Sure kids will enjoy the look of the film, but some of the dialogue will go over their heads. This movie also really shines on Blu-Ray as you can see the details in striking brilliance (check out the fur).

The movie itself is just a reminder of why watching movies can be such a great experience as you are transformed into this animated world of talking animals and greedy farmers. I was transfixed at the overall aesthetic of the entire film. When you've finished watching the movie, take your appreciation to a whole other level by watching the making of documentaries which chronicle the painstaking process that went into creating the characters with real puppets (in different scales) and what goes into creating stop-action animation. It's a shame that more people have not been exposed to this little gem of a film. But hopefully over time more people will get the chance to be charmed by this movie in the same way that I was.",1278374400,,1167,4.665048543689321
3770208,5,B001QOGYBI,"I just watched ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" last night for the first time and was extremely impressed.  It seems Wes Anderson and his team thought pretty hard about the subtle humor of this movie, adding in small comic details, subtle references (or not so subtle, like the homage to Sergio Leone in the showdown between Mr. Fox and the farmers), witty turns of phrase and making the characters not completely anthropomorphic (i.e. Mr. Fox and Mr. Badger's snarl-off in Badger's office, Mr. Fox carrying a dead squab in his mouth instead of in his hands, Mrs. Fox licking the mud off Ash's face, etc.).  Anderson really wants you to think of his characters as animals, albeit more urbane.

A lot of negative reviews state that they found this movie to be overly silly, but I would beg to disagree.  It's good-natured fun, animated fantasy.  The film stays relatively lighthearted (there are points where the movie even slightly breaks the fourth wall), and in the end, everyone is happy, and Mr. Fox still finds that he can ""stick it to the man.""  For those of you who are more inclined toward literary-criticism, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is ultimately a bildungsroman about recognizing one's true identity and abilities for what they are and accepting them (Mr. Fox comes to terms with his rakish nature).

The film does, as has been stated by other reviewers, cater to older audiences, as the humor is a bit more adult/adolescent.  However, that doesn't detract from the fun.

The only really odd (or should I say, surreal) part of the film as I saw it was ""Petey's Song,"" where Petey (a possible reference to Pete Seeger?  Note his banjo's skin), Mr. Bean's farm-overseer, leads the other farmhands in a song about the fox while Mr. Fox et al. raid the farms for food.  The song sort of comes out of nowhere and you're not exactly sure what to make of it, but it resolves itself in dry humor when Mr. Bean stops him midsong and asks him what he's doing.  Petey replies that he's singing a song and making it up as he's going along.  Bean replies in an ascerbic tone, ""That's bad songwriting, Petey.  You wrote a bad song,"" and stalks off into the night, leaving Petey and the others bewildered.

I give this film two enthusiastic thumbs up.  In the relatively small world of stop-motion feature-length films, I'd say this ranks with ""The Tale of the Fox"" (which inspired a great number of the characters in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") and Cosgrove Hall's ""The Wind in the Willows.""  I have a feeling that you'll enjoy it.",1278288000,,2503,4.678082191780822

My 28 year old and and his nephew [my grandson] were out laughing each other.  And you know what, I forgot how funny and cute and smart this movie was.  I loved the family dynamics and how the movie and storyline did not pull punches on responsibility, death, gluttony, and of course George Clooney [Mr. Fox].  Great purchase and something that we will watch over and over again.  This is an instant classic which we will be watching again at Thanksgiving after dinner.",1277078400,,641,4.389830508474576

During a raid on a chicken farm, they get caught in a trap and Mrs. Fox makes his promise that he should give up this life of crime should they come out alive and also that she is pregnant.

3770213,4,B001QOGYBI,"I had heard much hype about this film, and I didn't really pay it much attention.  But recently, I didn't have much on my plate to rent, so I decided to give this a try.  Does it live up to its hype, at least for me?  Well, not really, but it was still a pretty good film.

The stop motion is interesting; they went for a jerkier feel, presumably to give it a stylistic flair that's different from other famous stop motion movies such as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (which is beautiful, by the way).  I didn't mind the animation once I got used to it.  It does give the film some charm.

My main problem with this film is that other reviewers seemed to find it hilariously funny, but I just didn't laugh once.  I didn't even chuckle.  This film felt more like a study of familial interpersonal relationships than a comedy, and I guess it succeeded in that.  I felt like it was thought-provoking on many levels, one of them being the recognition of patterns of behavior that should be familiar to anyone who had even a mildly dysfunctional family.  On another level you could interpret the film's animal cast as a metaphor for the human condition.  When Mr. Fox got on his soap box (literally) at the end of the movie and made his little speech about appreciating what they had despite the fact that everything seems fake (""these apples look fake, but at least they have stars on them""), it made me think about our own society in that we've progressed technologically far past what our species is actually adapted for.  So yes, much of the way we live is fake, but it's still got its benefits and perks.  I liked how the animals' seemingly civilized behavior (wearing clothing, reading newspapers) was contrasted with their animalistic side (devouring food, growling at each other); once again, I saw the parallels in humanity - perhaps, we too, are just wild animals.

One last thing - at first, I found it difficult to like Mr. Fox.  He's just so self-centered that it can be difficult to relate to him.  However, by the end of the film, I warmed up to him.  He's clearly a flawed protagonist, but I have a soft spot for flawed protagonists, and he does redeem himself.  At the end of the day, he is awfully charming.

So, I do recommend this film, but perhaps not as a comedy nor even a family film since many of the themes are very adult.  Definitely rent this first before you buy, since you may or may not like it.  Overall, though, I liked it.",1276300800,,2447,4.439461883408072
3770214,5,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox / B001QOGYBI

One of the funniest movies I've seen all year, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" creates the perfect combination of an amusing plot, superb voice acting talent, and wonderful animation.

George Clooney perfectly voices a dryly witty ""family man"" fox who, longing for the carefree heists of his youth, plans an elaborate three-prong attack of the local farmers' larders. Supporting him is an absolutely all-star cast: a patient but fiery wife, a hilariously neglected and disgruntled son, a delightful ""straight man"" nephew well versed in karate, and a dozen other quirky and three-dimensional forest friends.

As cliche as it may sound, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" feels almost more like an experience than a movie - a lot of ""day in the life"" scenes are shown that are worthwhile and hilarious in their own right, even as they pertain to the plot later in this convoluted and fantastic voyage. Character development is just as humorous and ties in wonderfully with the advancement of the overall plot, or rather plots - since the ""plot"" changes and twists multiple times over the course of the movie from the initial heists, to their consequences, to daring fights and rescues, and finally to a new way of life for everyone to adjust to.

This movie is a delightful experience - and is one of the few movies that my family insisted on watching twice in a row!

3770215,1,B001QOGYBI,"The first half of the movie had potential, but it just falls apart into sillyness at the end, and 'suspending your disbelief' becomes impossible, after which the movie sadly falls off a cliff.  This was definitely not a kids movie because both the language and themes where adult oriented, and it is to 'over the top' silly (especially the end) for adults, so what demographic where the producers of this movie targeting, who knows?  The story-line was pointless, and plot just silly-stupid.  I couldn't wait for the movie to end -- and when it was over, I was left thinking, ""I wish I could have the last 2hrs of my life back"".

WRITTEN BY: Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach; based on the novel by Roald Dahl

DIRECTED BY: Wes Anderson

Rated: PG
Genre: Animation / Comedy
Release Date: 25 November 2009

Up was a really good movie, but the Oscar for best animated film belonged to Fantastic Mr. Fox. It should have also relieved Up for its slot in the top 10 best films of the year. I've never seen anything like it. The animation was spectacular as was the film in its entirety. It's smart, hilarious and brilliantly acted by everyone; George Clooney in particular. It's like Ocean's Eleven, but with animals, you see.

I have never read the famous children's book by Roald Dahl, but am dying to, having seen the film twice now. Screenwriter and director Wes Anderson's work may just be among the most unique in Hollywood, and this is my favorite of his films, hands down. Any guy, who puts Owen Wilson in virtually every film, is OK in my book.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is shot in stop animation and it's the best film I've ever seen in this style. From the sets, to the characters, to the outfits they are wearing; everything was given the minutest detail and it really shows itself off throughout the film. It may be PG, and it may be based on a children's book, and it may be animated, but Fantastic Mr. Fox is every bit as much for adults as it is for kids, if not more so. The characters at times use profanity, but rather than say the actual swear words out loud, they are cleverly replaced with the word, `cuss.' At one point in the film one of them says, ""Are you cussing with me?""

George Clooney stars as the voice of Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep voices his wife, Mrs. Fox. Their son Ash is voiced by the hilarious Jason Schwartzman and all three of them are phenomenal. Bill Murray is in here too as a badger who is an attorney and of course you can catch Owen Wilson as Ash's coach, Skip.

Mr. Fox has retired from his thrill of stealing chickens, as he made a promise to do so to Mrs. Fox, at the news that she was pregnant. Several years later however, he has once again taken an interest in the excitement of stealing chickens, and may hold some slight resentment to his son Ash, for being the reason he had to give up on his passion.

This is shown primarily by the way Mr. Fox does little to encourage Ash, who is short for his age and considered to be somewhat of an outcast. He's `different' - whatever that word means in today's society.

Things get worse for poor little Ash, when the prized child of the family, his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), comes to stay with them. Mr. Fox seems to be completely in the dark to the fact that he favors Kristofferson in his physical abilities in sporting activities, to those of his son Ash.

Ash definitely notices this, and he notices when the girl at school he has a crush on, takes a liking to Kristofferson. One of my favorite moments in the film is where Ash gives Kristofferson a guilt trip about not wanting to sleep on the floor of his room by saying, ""Oh you going to put about it? Because I've had it up to here with the sad house guest routine!"" Schwartzman's delivery is priceless.

Mr. Fox is enthralled with Kristofferson's athletic agility. When he has mastered up the perfect plan to get himself back into the game of chicken stealing, he brings his nephew along. Mr. Fox will strategically break into the chicken factories of three notorious rich men in town. The fact that his plan may backfire, never crosses his mind.

There is some suspense to be had, especially when he learns that one of them is being guarded by one of Mr. Fox's long forgotten enemies; Rat, played by Willem Dafoe. Great scenes here as well folks. Before Mr. Fox knows it, his entire family is in danger because of his lying and selfishness and it's up to him to save everyone, and hopefully learn a lesson or two in the process.

The film is so much, you simply can't miss it. There are some moments that may scare younger kids, as at times the animals are, well - animalistic, in nature. Especially the way they eat. In addition to this, they look very real, and there are several close-ups of their furry faces that will leave you breathless.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is littered with laughs throughout - the kind that escape unexpectedly and boisterously. It's fun for everyone and kids will be entertained and pick up on the lessons the film feeds them: stealing is wrong, lying is wrong and family is what matters most. Just like this film, it's fantastic!",1275436800,,4719,4.514654161781946

3770220,4,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is stellar example of stop-motion animation and looks fantastic on hi-def. The entire production is richly detailed and painstakingly animated, with a wonderful soundtrack that's as much a part of this film as the furry creatures that inhabit it. It's very nostalgic, beginning with the Ballad of Davy Crockett and includes folk songs from Burt Ives and a selection of pop songs (like the Beach Boys). One climactic scene is punctuated by the Rolling Stones' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Fighting-Man/dp/B00006AW2J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Fighting Man</a>"" and it's hard to imagine a better song to go along with the action after hearing it. The rest of the diverse and richly-textured OST&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Original-Soundtrack/dp/B002OULHPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(Original Soundtrack)</a>&nbsp;was created by French film composer Alexandre Desplat, consisting of piano, banjos, violin, xylophones, flute, and brass band. It gives the film a magical, golden innocence that's playful, nostalgic and timeless all at the same time, perfectly suited for a children's story. Each song is tailored to the onscreen action and is delightful to listen to. Where Mr. Fox is running free in the fields, the music has the country twang of banjos and springy piano. Every scene with the rat (a villain) ramps up to a spaghetti-westerny twang of guitars and whistling (""Bean's Secret Cider Cellar""), an homage to Ennio Morricone's theme from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/B001U6YI92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>. In hi-def, you can really appreciate all the care and attention that went into making this film, including the texture of the fur and clothing the animals wear, the lettering on boxes and labels, and even the writing in newspapers.

The story: Mr. Fox is a clever, but reckless chicken thief. He is sly, fast-talking, and persuasive (perhaps even manipulative). This is established from the clever dialog right out the starting gate between him and his wife in the choice of scenic route or shortcut, and method of entry into the squad shack they are about to pilfer (Mr. Fox always gets his choice). During the raid, Mr. and Mrs. Fox get caught in a fox trap (due to Mr. Fox's hubris) as they are about to make off with their loot. She tells him she is pregnant and makes him promise to give up his life of crime should they survive. 2 years go by and he is now a newspaper columnist and a family man, looking to move out of his hole in the ground and into a nicer tree so he doesn't feel so poor. They move into a tree near the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three very mean farmers. Mr. Fox plans one last heist with the help of his dimwitted opossum building superintendent, Kylie. One last heist becomes three as Mr. Fox lapses back to his old ways, with each raid getting progressively more daring that the last.

Angered by the thefts, the farmers band together to eliminate their pest problem. Eventually, his entire family and all the animals of the forest get roped into the situation because of Mr. Fox's selfishness, in an escalating war brought about by the three men, who are determined to kill Mr. Fox at all costs.

Despite the PG rating, I don't feel that this film is suitable for most kids due to the slow pacing and Wes Anderson-styled melancholy that is his trademark. The script feels like it's meant for adults rather than children, despite the origin of this story being a Roald Dahl novel. George Clooney delivers most of his lines in a deadpan, and while there are a few quick action sequences, the film is driven mostly by dialog and is an exploration of family dynamics (husband-wife, father-son, son-nephew). High-school aged audiences may be fine, but this film is certainly not for the under-13 crowd. It's not very kid-friendly stuff and may bore younger viewers.

But for adults, it's definitely worth checking out. And get the amazing soundtrack too! 4.5/5 stars.",1274572800,2,4149,5.358895705521473

3770223,5,B001QOGYBI,"I am a huge fan of all types of animation. It's wonderful that stop motion is getting some new life with the likes of Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, Corpse Bride and now this gem Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was not familiar with the Dahl book or story so I was going into this one blind. I fell in love with the characters, story, sets, voices and animation immediately. The majority of the movie's humor and dialogue (there's a good deal of desert dry chatter in this film) will fly right over the heads of most children and even some adults to be certain. The humor is dry, full of wit and adult driven. I loved it!

Video quality on this Blu Ray is strong, nearly perfect. Autumn colors are abundant and the texture of the character's wardrobe and fur is nothing short of amazing. These details really bring this film to life. The audio quality is good; the center channel gets the biggest work out by far on this DTS HD MA lossless track. I was a tad disappointed that the surround speakers and sub-woofer did not get more activity. This audio track was a bit subdued for such a lively movie. Make no mistake though, the dialogue is handled extremely well and the track sounds very solid. Just just don't expect a wiz bang audio excursion track like Up, Wall-E or Coraline.

The vocal casting and acting in this animated feature are superb; I don't think I have ever heard better in any animated film. You can sell this one to the kids but the adults are the ones that will truly reap the reward when this disc starts up. This is a must own title for all animation and home video enthusiasts.

3770227,3,B001QOGYBI,"I saw the previews for this movie, but like most nowadays I missed any chance at going to see it in the theater, so I had to do with renting it and watching it at my home.

The thing that attracted me most to the movie was the animation and the stars. George's deep, even voice against Meryl's beautiful, low tones seemed like an interesting match for a movie like this, and the animation- stop-motion- has become quite popular with movie-makers. But ironically, the thing that made the film most famous- its animation- is the reason I couldn't give it five stars.

You know the English- they've got their own breed of quirky, fun humor that I fully enjoy. This movie certainly feels different somehow, perhaps the lack of color and adult-feel to the story has to do with it. It's a quiet, cute movie, and yet it feels weird. I know the fans will hate me for that, too.

And the animation is... well, it contributes to the odd sensation of the film. It's artistic and interesting to observe, but stiff and jerky. The characters have a lack of movement, and it feels ridiculous- like the scenes where they all dig into the ground? It looks really bizarre, not to mention the scene they get flushed away by cider. So the animation, I think, takes away from the charming feel of this little movie. Had they done it in CG, it wouldn't have been so famous (I mean, there's so many CG movies, I guess I understand why they chose to do stop-animation to be different), but it would have helped the story.

But my ranting done, it's a good movie, and worth a watch. It's got bits of humor sprinkled here and there that made me laugh, and Mr. Fox's son reminded me a lot of a friend of mine, which made his character all the more enjoyable. Certainly not for kids... with an amount of violence that I'm guessing strict parents would hate their babies to watch. But adults and teenagers will most likely enjoy. I found it a little boring at parts, but it smoothed over with a pretty good message and some good speeches from good old Meryl and George. Some other smaller parts are snagged by actors that'll make you be like, ""Whoa- he's in here, too?"" The deep, rumbling voice of Michael Gambon as one of the deranged, scary farmers made me chuckle- because everyone likes a reminder of our old wizard, Dumbledore.

So a good idea, a cute plot, but bizarre. Watch if you want, buy if you're a die-hard Wes Anderson fan.",1273881600,,2408,4.45124716553288

Some adults I have talked to just hated it, or didn't get it, or saw it as a propoganda film.  I am an adult, and I just loved it.

*** Spoiler alert! ****

This story sets a nice foundation and builds upon itself through its characters.  It is presented using (now-rare) stop animation.  The style is colorized with an orange/brown scheme (sunrise, sunset) and is nearly perfectly voiced.  It is recognizable as a Roald Dahl book, and also as a Wes Anderson film.  It is appropriate as a kids' movie, but it is also a nonreligious, nondramatic parable regarding the human behavior to regress to your instincts.  ""Wild animals"" need to be kept in check, but tend toward activities not well received by the [in this case, woman] who would otherwise 'keep' us back in civilization (as regarded).  Mr. Fox has a trademark whistle and a guilty, 'silly-me' grin -- he knows what he is and how he is received.  But, then again,(!) the future wife was also front and center in the original schemes as well....and yet demands we regress into what is proper.  She is here more risk averse, not as daring, and probably not nearly as 'stupid.'  She is more civilized.  Ponder the situation, and it hints about why we allow ourselves to be captive and to conform.

Also note some parallels to Roald Dahl himself: has was a writer, very athletically capable, captain of several teams (very tall too), was a pilot in Africa in WWII and reputedly engaged in espionage.  Read 'Going Solo,' his autobiography, if you want to learn more (it's also very good.)

3770242,5,B001QOGYBI,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is fantastic!  I love all types of animation and this one does not disappoint.  Most animation is cell animation, drawn with (or sometimes without) computer assistance  But Mr. Fox is artfully done in stop-motion animation which is delightful and refreshes the imagination.  This style is shot frame by frame, with the slightest changes made to the ""puppets"" in each frame, creating a smooth flow of movement when viewed as a film.  The result is the animals hair, and other things, move in an interesting way creating a completely different effect from the animation we are used to.  If you are not familiar with this type of animation, that alone could be the reason to make the purchase.
  Now for the fun part, the story itself.  I've watched this film at least 6 times at home and two times at the theater.  Each time I watch, I laugh even though I know what to expect.  It is a bit more of an adult film than a child's animation.  I think older children would get a lot out of it because it is a great moral tale without being preachy. The story is well told and wonderfully illustrated.  The characters are all memorable and make you want more.  The scenes of the animals eating and digging are especially well done.  The story is about the animals working together to overcome their situation although they have different needs.  Even the wolf which was feared thorough out the film comes off strong and respected.

The animation is quirky and fun in how retro-looking it is.

This is one of those wonderful children's movies that works on enough levels that adults can enjoy it, and the fact that it starts with ""The Ballad of Davie Crocket"" on the soundtrack, even my 69 year old father could appreciate it. The cast is a collection of Wes Anderson favorites, and their onscreen presence is not diminished by the fact that you can't see them. George Clooney's portrayal of Mr. Fox (his first Anderson film I believe,) is just right, increasing my respect in his abilities as an actor. Meryl Streep's performance of Mrs. Fox is wonderful, but you hardly realize it's her.

This DVD version of the movie has a few nice extras showing how the animation was done. Behind the scenes views such as this are always fun, but for a stop-motion-animation movie, it really increases your appreciation of what it takes to create such a vision.

This movie is bound to become a cult classic (much like other Anderson films,) but with the advantage of being a cult classic that can span generations--how many movies can claim that?",1271980800,3,1194,4.708133971291866
3770246,5,B001QOGYBI,"Provided you like off beat, ""quirky"" movies. This movie is definitely a bit on the weird side, and that's not a bad thing! Too many movies these days are carbon copies of each other, the same tired formulas, and uninspired actors. But every once in a while a movie comes along that is a breath of fresh air, and beats to it's own drum. The Fantastic Mr Fox is that movie. When you begin the opening scene, the Ballad of Davey Crockett is playing, and that alone lets you know this is not going to be an ordinary movie. At first I thought that the movie could have used a little more color, but after viewing this movie again and again (and again) I started to appreciate the subtle colors of the landscapes, buildings and even the animals. Not too much, not too little.

The soundtrack has an off-beat feel to it, which gives this film even more life and adds to the rich texture of the movie. The stop animation may take a while to get used to. But give it a chance, it is very well done. The facial expressions of the characters are hilarious, and the film doesn't rely on crude jokes to make you laugh out loud, or gross you out. The voicing was done beautifully, William DeFoe steals the scenes he's in playing the rat, and I can't think of anyone better to cast as Mr and Mrs Fox. George Clooney and Meryl Streep are wonderful, and their son Ash voiced by Jason Schwartzman struggles as their son desperately trying to prove he is an athlete.

As the movie progresses, we see that the world of Mr Fox is more than it seems, as he steals from the meanest farmers alive (Boggis Bunce and Bean) and has to work fevereshly to stay one step ahead of the farmers who want to ""blow the cuss to smithereens."" Mr Fox will go through many obstacles to prove he is the ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" and the rest of the animals are along for the ride. And just when it seems all is well, an unexpected occurance happens and things are back to square one all over again.

This film, as another reviewer said, is full of intelligence. I couldn't agree more. This is not a fast paced movie, nor is it one where things blow up or gunshots ring out every ten minutes. Don't expect to watch this movie expecting lots of action, nor for something to grab you the first scene and not let go. There is no dramatic climax to speak of, and the end of the movie may end in ways that people don't want. (How many movies end with animals dancing?) I think that ending is perfect, as it adds to the quirkiness of the movie. Overall, this movie is a breath of fresh air, something to be enjoyed again and again.

--------------

Who do you think will win in a battle of will and wit, man or animal? Mr. Fox, who looks like a businessman in a smartly tailored suit, is the leader of the animal team in the 2-D stop-motion animated feature ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox.""  A few years ago, he had promised his short-tempered wife, Mrs. Fox who was pregnant at the time, to never steal a chicken or livestock ever again after they were trapped in a cage while attempting to steal a chicken.  Mr. Fox then became a columnist for the animal newspaper, but with paltry readership.  His wild animal instinct yearned to be in the action and dodge danger.

Mr. Fox sneakily stole food and chickens from the meanest farmers in the neighborhood, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.  Boggis, owner of a chicken farm, is very large and eats three chickens each for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, that is 12 chickens a day!

Bunce is the size of a dwarf.  His head would be submerged in the shallow end of a swimming pool.  He eats doughnuts with goose liver injected into them.  That may sound disgusting, but goose liver is a great delicacy, and Bunce doesn't seem to know that.

Bean is as skinny as a pencil and the meanest of the three.  He makes distilled hard cider with his genetically engineered apples.  He drinks only cider, and leads the human army in the man vs. animal war.

Mrs. Fox finally found out about Mr. Fox's hidden activities, but worse yet, the farmers plotted an epic revenge.  Mr. Fox must assemble an army of animals and use his wit, strategic thinking, and wild animal spirit to win the battle.

In the fox family, there is also a ""small one,"" Ash.  He is the only son, I mean cub.  He is a problem child, because he is not confident and always wears a strange outfit - a cape.  Ash is distant from everyone because he feels deprived of love and attention from his scheming dad.

When Ash's cousin Kristofferson comes to stay with the Fox family, Ash is jealous of Kristofferson's many talents: yoga, graceful diving, and excellent sportsmanship in the complicated game of whackbat.  Intense ""cousin rivalry"" ensued.

I noticed that while the mammals such as Mr. Fox talked in the movie, the chickens did not.  I thought maybe if the chickens did talk, Mr. Fox would feel sympathy and not eat them.  But Mr. Fox spoke English just like the farmers, and the farmers still wanted to kill him.  Also, the rat who guarded Bean's cider cellar told Mr. Fox that his dying wish was to taste Bean's cider, but I saw the rat sipping the very cider contentedly with a long straw earlier in the film!

My mom once saw a fox pulling a dead fox off of a road so that cars would not drive through the dead fox.  They were like Mr. Fox in looks, but were not clothed and could not talk or walk on two legs.  They were not afraid of humans.  My mom was impressed by their caring for each other.

I give this movie four starfish.  It is about friendship, wit, trickery, and strategy.  I like the visual style of the film.  The fur looks so real, it moves when the animals talk or have facial expressions.

After watching the film, I read the book from which this movie is based, that was originally published in 1970, a children's book classic.  The author Roald Nahl has good drawings though his sketch is somewhat blurry.  I like the movie better because the characters are richer.  There are new characters like Ash and Kristofferson in the movie that made the family dynamics more interesting.  The visuals are more vivid and the story is funnier in the movie.

My favorite character is Mr. Fox.  He is witty, smart, and charming.  He is a messy eater who wolfs down his food.  Mr. Fox is not careful and his strategies often backfire, because he thinks only of the thrill and reward, not of the risk and consequences of his actions.  One of the early scenes showed Mr. Fox using blueberries with crude anesthesia to drug the beagles guarding Boggis's chicken house.  When Mr. Fox and his helper the opossum stole a chicken, sirens flashed and gave away their identity, they scrambled over the electric fence, being shocked all the way!

My favorite scene is when Mr. Fox raised his paw and the silhouetted wolf raised his too, in recognition of brotherhood and wild animal spirit.  This is also the funniest scene.

Before taking risks, think about not only the rewards, but also the consequences.

3770251,2,B001QOGYBI,"This animated film, which features Armageddon between a fox who just cannot get thievery out of his system and three wealthy, but deranged, local farmers, gets points for its original style and a few good laughs, but no more.  In the end, it is just another relatively mindless action spectacle--a very sophisticated Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon.  Stack it up against a ""Wall-E"" or a ""Secret of NIMH"" and its fundamental hollowness becomes evident.  Unfortunate use of a very high-powered cast.",1270944000,8,498,5.1234567901234565
3770252,4,B001QOGYBI,"For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those ""family-friendly"" animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no ""Fritz the Cat,"" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic ""cuss"" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.

Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that?  But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.

Like Anderson's live-action works, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.

It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.",1270339200,,2204,4.807387862796833
3770253,5,B001QOGYBI,"Simply put, this is one of the greatest laid back fun movies I've watched recently. It has great characters and dialog, plus the stop-motion and cinematography are breathtaking (make sure you see it on blu-Ray). The only small downside might be the plot, which is a bit generic, but it follows the story from the book. As to how much a child will enjoy this, I do not know, it has some heavy adult themes in it. The comedy is very offbeat, as always in Wes Anderson's films. I don't normally do reviews on here, but I was so amazed by this movie, that I just had to write something and hope it brings more attention to it. I didn't think it was the best movie of 2009, either. It was just a very, very fun, charming watch.",1270252800,,722,4.239130434782608
3770254,2,B001QOGYBI,"I'm sorry, I thought this was awful.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it was great.

The stop motion looked bad, although I couldn't tell if that was the intention of the animators or not.  Even though I had read the book, I just couldn't find interest in the plotline.  I had to constantly turn up the television volume because the voices were so low and quiet.

I couldn't stand the animal characters and was cheering for the farmers about halfway through it.  This movie was not a delight, and a bit disturbing.",1270166400,7,519,4.410526315789474
3770255,3,B001QOGYBI,"This is a cute movie, great for kids and families. However, I found the animation very distracting.

I realize stop-frame (model) animation is nearly as challenging as drawn animation, and I admire anyone who takes it on. But for a big-budget, professional production, I found the animation so distractingly unlifelike I couldn't relax and enjoy the story.

And is it just my imagination, or did they use a lower animation framerate (number of frames per second) than usual, to limit production costs? That would account for some of the jerkiness, though not all of it.

(By contrast, the characters in the ""Wallace and Gromit"" features are much less sophisticated, yet they're so well-animated I have no trouble suspending my disbelief and enjoying them.)

As if that weren't distracting enough, these characters are covered with fur. Even when the they do nothing but speak, this fur is always shifting here and there from the animators' adjustments. Maybe there's no way to avoid that, but it was another constant reminder that I was watching models, not ""living"" characters.",1269993600,5,1078,5.107954545454546
3770256,5,B001QOGYBI,"I think the title of my review says it all.

It's hilarious. The script is great. It's like Ocean's Eleven in stop motion.

The little touches are great - how they eat (like wild animals), Mrs. Fox's huge paintings actually tiny in human hands, etc. etc. Genius.

Slighly gory, the shot-off tail. But otherwise kid-friendly.",1269907200,,324,4.8545454545454545
3770257,4,B001QOGYBI,"It took two views but I loved this movie:

A fan of both stop-motion animation and Wes Anderson, this film was a field day for me;
Anderson created a whimsical world of charming woodland animals who talk and act with the same shining irreverence and neurosis as characters from his previous movies. The characters, even as animals, all seem to have that same honest sense of lovable melancholy that always remains undeniably optimistic.

As is often the case with Anderson's films, Mr. Fox is designed beautifully with that consistent sense of colorful minimalism that spawns a magical visual aesthetic: a style that flourishes when animated.
For me, between this and Where the Wild Things are, I feel like many filmmakers are taking children's conceptions and really making films for adults. Mr. Fox was so enjoyable and also so consistently smart. The humor was unlike that in a Shrek movie with obvious jokes for children and then plenty for adults; the humor in Mr. Fox was skewed more towards edgy and ironic (without being vulgar at all).

All elements combined; this movie was artfully spectacular, and just so darn charming.

Bring the wife, kids, and your hipster cousins along because 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' has something for everyone.",1269820800,,1246,5.004830917874396
3770258,4,B001QOGYBI,"This short animation movie was highly recommended by my teenage daughter who saw it with her friends in the theater when it first came out.  I agree.  It's a cute movie with chuck full of very talented actors' voice over.  The storyline was very easy to follow, but the artwork wasn't visually appealing to me.  Everything was painted in monochrome color of ochre, the color of fox.  Nothing stood out.  I'm glad I saw it, nonetheless.  I think even the little children will find it entertaining.  Good movie to watch for the entire family.",1269820800,,540,4.670212765957447
3770259,4,B001QOGYBI,"""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, though it has been embellished a great deal by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has put the dangerous life of a poultry thief behind him and settled down with Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and a newspaper job. But, never satisfied with the ordinary, Mr. Fox wants to move out of their hole into fancier digs in a treehouse near the Boggis, Bunce, and Bean farms, which prove to be too much temptation. Mr. Fox desperately wants to pull off one last poultry caper. With his hapless opossum handyman Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky) in tow, he aims to rob all three farms -which doesn't sit well with the human farmers, especially Mr. Bean (Michael Gambon), who vows to kill the crafty fox.

This is cute enough for children and clever enough to satisfy adults, who will appreciate Mr. Fox's blunt talk. The addition of two young characters, the Fox's son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), seems stranger the more I think about it. But the two young oddballs seem to be there to provide an everybody-has-something-to-contribute theme for the children in the audience. Actually, fans of the story may be more surprised by the changes in theme than in the plot. The derring-do that makes Mr. Fox so ""fantastic"" is the object of much criticism, and the plot has been wrangled to service ""family values"" themes. That puts a damper on its irreverence, but there is still a lot to like in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", including richly colored stop-motion animation.",1269820800,3,1567,4.847014925373134
3770260,3,B001QOGYBI,"So you take big stars for the voice over but then they use crappy stop motion techniques for the animation. What you end up with is a product that is good
but could have been better.
What bothers me is that they still charge you a arm and a leg anyway.
Good movie, rent it  ...and if you like it buy it second hand...so you won't feel
ripped off.

 The story is good but not too complex. Its like watching one of those family
episodes on TV where they deal with different issues...but done with animals instead
of humans.",1269820800,3,521,4.242424242424242
3770261,1,B001QOGYBI,"The praise is evident for this film, but look at the numbers - it barely regained its $40 million budget domestically, and there's a reason for that. The movie is awful by animation standards and there was little 'must-see' buzz about it. Here are a few reasons:

- Stop motion animation is creepy, and parts of it look like a very bad Saturday morning cartoon (particularly the parts where they're digging)
- The voice acting in this film is horribly bland. Instead of using talented voice actors, like they do in Shrek or any Pixar films, they use an all-star cast of actors who sound as if they didn't know they were recording for a movie.
- The characters are not memorable. They won't be living in our memory and kids won't be buying their toys (since there aren't any). Compare this to Up, or Toy Story.
- There are no memorable original songs in this, but instead The Beach Boys, for a movie about foxes stealing chickens on a farm.
- The story is very predictable.

The voices of those who enjoy this film are severely beating those who feel the same way as I do, but ultimately its box office numbers should make it obvious. Good animated films make hundreds of millions of dollars, easily. This didn't come anywhere close.

Can those who 'do not find this review helpful' explain why this film was a FLOP and that few people, relative to GOOD animated films, want to see this? Didn't think so.",1269734400,32,1403,4.515748031496063
3770262,5,B001QOGYBI,"I would think the audience is limited for this kind of animated film but, thank goodness,I'm one of those people who loved it. ""Fox"" is written for other adults, let's be honest. This isn't a kids' movie because most of the dialog would go right over their heads. However, intelligent adults with a vocabulary and a quirky sense of humor should love it.  The details in the drawings also come through nicely in the Blu-Ray version.

The story is typical; father finds out family is more important than anything and young son tries to win approval from dad - but how this is executed is really ""clever"" to both see and hear.

If you think animated films are strictly for the young; this movie will change your mind.",1269734400,,714,4.5625
3770263,5,B001QOGYBI,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Mr-Fox/dp/0756982863/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Mr. Fox</a>, a children's book by Roald Dahl, is the basis for this stop animation film featuring the voices of George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox.  A good choice for an entertaining family film, but some of the humor will go over younger viewers heads.  Where adults would say a 'bad word', the writers have the characters simply say 'cuss'.  As an adult viewing the film, I found this really funny because my head naturally put to mind what words 'I' would use in a similar situation!

Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox is a cute story of about a fox who upon learning of his wife's pregnancy with their first kit agrees to give up his profession ""stealing chickens"" and settle down into a more sedate life as a columnist.  All is well until 12 fox years later when Mr. Fox becomes unsettled by his 'poor' lifestyle and decides to go against the promise that he made to his wife.  He convinces his landlord (a possum) to join him in a heist, and it feels so go he goes for another... and another... and another.  Eventually this risky behavior puts Mr. Fox, his family and the other friends (creatures who share his life) in danger from the three disgruntled farmers from whom he's been stealing.

The animation is different than anything in recent memory and a nice divergence from the digital animation we are all now used to viewing.  It's neat to see the animals fur and feel like you could touch it.  It's also kind of weird to see them run and get taller and/or smaller depending upon the scene, but after awhile you get used it it and immerse yourself in the story.

Fun music, sharp dialogue done by actors we love, a fun story done in a new way, made Fantastic Mr. Fox an enjoyable movie for my family.  I'd recommend it!",1269734400,,1882,4.792569659442725
3770264,5,B001QOGYBI,"Wes Anderson's sixth directorial feature and first animated film is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's book Fantastic Mr. Fox. With a script co-written with Noah Baumbach, Anderson's film stays close to the source material (though I can't speak on that completely having never read the source material), but his quirky, minimalist style is still identifiable.

The cast of voice actors, including several Anderson regulars, is top notch. George Clooney is Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep is Mrs. Fox, Jason Schwartzman is their alienated son Ash, Eric Anderson is the impressive nephew Kristofferson, Bill Murray is Mr. Fox's lawyer Badger, and Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Adrien Brody round out the rest of the voice cast. No actor is miscast in their voice roles and Clooney, Dafoe, and Schwartzman give particularly inspired performances.

The film's story is wonderful; both funny, entertaining, and having a strong moral/ethical lesson but its Anderson's direction and various technical aspects that make Fantastic Mr. Fox as fantastic as it is. It's rare for one to mention costume design when referring to an animated film, but the costume design here is wonderful. As many have said before me, it should have received an Oscar nomination and only didn't due to rules about animated features. The characters and sets are intricately designed, showcasing Anderson's attention to detail. It's a painstaking process to make a stop-motion feature and its clear watching the film that the filmmakers wanted to make sure that they were putting their time to great use. While there are plenty of stop-motion movies out there, none look the way this one does which makes it even more fascinating to watch. The animation should fascinate both adults and children with its detail and personality. The soundtrack also contributes to the overall tone of the film with its mix of classic rock and folk music.

More than anything, this film has heart, personality, and charm. It's intelligently written and very quotable, as well as very funny. There is some adult humor, but it's not slyly inserted to amuse parents. It's well-written, clever adult humor that is actually funny and relevant to the film. With that said, it will appeal to both adults and children for different reasons and it doesn't insult the intelligence of either demographic. In a display of very clever writing, Anderson has the characters say ""cuss"" in place of any cuss word, which is a rather brilliant touch. Finally, Ash, the teenaged fox desperately vying for his father's attention is actually more human than many live-action characters that hit the screen. Much of this comes from Schwartzman's voice performance, but it's in the writing too. In both personality and expression, I found these stop-motion creations are more expressive and emotional (especially in the eyes) than the majority of motion-capture films that have been released (particularly those by Robert Zemeckis). Even with Anderson's style, I think Roald Dahl would have been very pleased with this film.

This is the best animated film of 2009. Having seen it twice now, I can attest that it's also one of the top ten best films of 2009 and it's sad that many ignore its inventiveness and charm. Wes Anderson and co. have created something very special here.

Great voice acting, amazing stop-motion creatures and sets, quirky but appropriate soundtrack, and the elements which can be found in most Wes Anderson movies.  I like a lot of movies, but this is one of the very few I loved.  Recommended without hesitation.

For the videophile, if you are sick of showing off 'perfect' animation, this film will be of interest.  With the exception of a few trivial flaws found in just a few scenes for a few seconds, this is probably the best looking thing to come across my display.

3770270,5,B001QOGYBI,"I honestly didn't know what to expect with this movie.  It is not a cartoon but it is not a regular movie, and I just didn't get it.  The movie is also based on a book by Roald Dahl called Fantastic Mr. Fox which I unfortunately hadn't read before.  This movie is adorable and I cannot believe it held my 3 year old and 20 month old's attention for the whole movie!  I know they didn't really get what was going on, but they were fascinated by it, as was I.  The movie was about Mr. Fox who lives a dangerous life as a chicken stealer, then quits when he finds out he is going to be a dad.  After a few years, he realizes he is missing something and decides to do a few 'jobs' stealing from the meanest farmers in the county.  The movie has some great lessons though like:  It is okay to be different, Don't lie, and Work together.  I found myself laughing throughout this movie, and I actually won't mind when my boys want to watch it again!  I am always going to pick up the book!

I would recommend this movie to all ages.  It is a cute tale and if you loved the book by Roald Dahl, then you have to check it out.  I also really liked the voices, for example, George Clooney is Mr. Fox and he pretty much talks the whole movie.  I also loved the relationship between his son and nephew - one an outside and the other one popular and good at everything.  All the animals though are adorable and great additions to the movie.",1268006400,2,1426,4.097472924187725

3770272,5,B001QOGYBI,"Wes Anderson likes to make fun of the human condition, and he sorta succeeds here...altering a few obvious details. With the great Noah Baumbach, he has scripted one of the most amusing and entertaining films I've seen in years. This animated film is old school, naturalistic, and very reminiscent of the classic animated films of yore. A little known tale by Roald Dahl is presented, voiced by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, etc., with a charm and originality that can't be compared to other Dahl tales on film. It's nominated for 2 Oscars, and I think it should win something, but the criteria of the Academy is not the same as us, the general public. I enjoyed ""Up"" a lot, but I enjoyed ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" a bit more. Both are fine films. Both are exhausting, regarding plot. Both have cynical reparte, but ""Mr Fox"" had characters that were sillier and funnier. Alexandre Desplat's Oscar nominated score was appropriate on all levels. I simply enjoyed this film a lot.",1266624000,3,1002,4.8313953488372094
3770273,4,B001QOGYBI,"""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a fun movie. Its stop-motion animation is surprisingly beautiful, and the design of the settings and characters combined with the effect creates a movie that is a visual pleasure to watch. It tells the story of the Fox family, whose patriarch, the titular Mr. Fox, incurs the wrath of three neighboring farmers who engage the family in an all-out war.

An all-star cast lend their voices to these characters, including George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as his wife, and Bill Murray as their badger friend, Badger. The actors give a quirky charm to the characters, and make them endearing and entertaining to watch as they fend off the warring farmers. The action is set to an excellent score by Alexandre Desplat, and has a strong spaghetti Western influence.

The screenplay is lacking at times. Writer/director Wes Anderson is a darling of ""indie"" culture, and his style is a little forced in this film; some of the lines come off as overly self-conscious and forcedly quirky, but overall this does not diminish the zany charm and fun of the movie. If nothing else, it's worth a watch to see its gorgeous animation, and it's certain to leave a smile on your face.",1266537600,3,1194,4.763285024154589
3770274,5,B001QOGYBI,"I haven't seen a lot of films by Wes Anderson.  I've seen (and loved) `The Royal Tenenbaums' and I saw (and found highly overrated) `Rushmore'.  Even with only those two viewings though, it is apparent that Anderson has a unique style, visually as well as vocally.  His humor is very dry to the point where he is either astonishingly clever or almost too gimmicky.

Ok, forget it.  I was going to go into this longwinded (as usual) spiel about how Wes Anderson's style is apparent all over this film, but in a good way, but I'm getting too impatient.

All I want to say is, ""THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC""!

If you know me then you know that I don't normally get overly excited about animated films.  Sure, there are the occasional animated features that really reach me, but as a rule I'm not entirely drawn to them.  There was something about this film though, that grabbed me from the first promo I saw.  I just knew that I HAD TO SEE THIS!  I took my daughter (my wife refused to go) and I liked it more than she did (to be fair, this is a very adult cartoon with mature humor and a bland color palate that fails to ignite the interest of a toddler).  This is not you average `laugh out loud' type of comedy, but if you are familiar with Anderson then you know that that is not his style.

This humor is subtle yet totally spot on.

The story is that of Mr. Fox, a retired chicken thief who has settled into the life of husband and father, yet he still feels that aching need for adventure.  When Mr. Fox attempts to get his thrills in by stealing from three very nasty men, he finds that these men will stop at nothing to destroy Mr. Fox and his family.

The voice work couldn't have been better.  The deadpan delivery suits comic actors like Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman effortlessly, but even George Clooney and Meryl Streep fall beautifully into line.  Anderson's direction captures the humor in every scene, and his ascetic is seen all over the place, to glorious effect.  I'd easily say that Schwartzman is best in show (I never thought I'd ever say that about him).  His voice work totally embodies his character (Ash is just such a brilliant creation) to the point where his every word and action is undeniably unforgettable.

I will say this, the film is not really one I'd recommend for young children, you know, when they are going through that `impressionable stage'.  Some of the dialog, while not explicit, could be objectionable to parents.  If you don't want your children running around using the word `cuss' in place of colorful expressions you might want to keep them away from this.  This is a Roald Dahl adaptation, so the darker themes are to be expected (there are some deaths on screen and some malicious violence), but they are handled with wit and cleverness (that ""soap"" line is priceless).

I totally recommend this for any adult willing to embrace his inner child!",1266192000,8,2896,4.523076923076923
3770275,3,B001QOGYBI,"In A Nutshell: The movie reminded me of some of the movies I saw as a child because the animation is ""stop-motion"" like the Rudolph's Shiny New Year and A Year Without A Santa Claus.

Roald Dahl is a brilliant author and James and the Giant Peach was one of my favorite books when I was growing up.

This is a grown up animated story. I tried to get my 4 year old to watch with me but she was uninterested. I think it is because the colors aren't as vivid and the images weren't as quick as the movies kids are used to these days.

There were parts I wasn't comfortable with like farmers shouting, ""lets kill kim"" before shooting Mr. Fox's tail off. Also, the scene where Mrs. Fox is bandaging up Mr. Fox's bloody butt, where his tail came off keeps replaying in my head. I could have done without the bloody bandage. Other than that, the movie was smart, and older children or adults may be more interested than your little one.

It was too wordy and slow for today's kids to sit through but the idea of stop-motion animation in a new format was fun. I really loved the soundtrack/score.",1266192000,15,1088,4.2926829268292686
3770276,5,B001QOGYBI,"While I think UP was the finest animated film of the year, THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX was in my opinion the second best animated film of 2009.  As stop action it isn't as polished as Nick Park's films along the same lines (which pretty much remains the Rolls Royce of stop animation), but it has virtues of its own, including absolutely spectacular voice over work, especially by George Clooney in the title role, though Bill Murray as the Badger and Michael Gambon as a deliciously evil farmer.  The film is also laced with remarkable wit and intelligence.  The result is one of the freshest, most original animated films that I have seen in a long, long time.

When my my daughter was very young we read through just about all of Roald Dahl's books.  This was just about the only one that we didn't read, so I have absolutely no idea whether this is in any way faithful to the original.  I can state, however, categorically that this is the best adaptation of any of his books.

This is also another fascinating addition to the collected works of Wes Anderson, who has produced a string of interesting if quirky movies.  I honestly think this might be my favorite of his films; actually, that is not quite correct.  I definitely think that this is the best of his films.",1265414400,,1267,4.521929824561403
3770277,5,B001QOGYBI,"""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a sort of fairy tale for adults, and yet also appeals to children (on different levels of course). Mr. Fox, who is ably voiced by the talented George Clooney (all suave and composed, yet wild at heart - in the movie I mean:)) reminds us of the pitfalls of adulthood, of having to ""settle"" when one's soul yearns for something more, and Mr. Fox, who has made a promise to Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) many moons ago not to risk himself hunting chickens ever again, has ""settled"" into a stable yet boring life as a newspaper columnist. But Mr. Fox misses the adrenaline rush and excitement that comes with hunting - so he transplants his family (which includes a rather average son, Ash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) who is constantly trying to prove himself to his accomplished father) to a tree which overlooks three farms, owned by the nasty farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. Before long, Fox is planning an assault on the farms, and gets an o'possum, Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) to act as his reluctant sidekick, who also has a tendency to space out.

Well, things don't go quite as planned (surprise, surprise), and Fox and family find themselves at the receiving end of the farmers' rage, led by Farmer Bean (Michael Gambon who credibly portrays the riled up English erm, 'gentleman'). So, it's up to wily Mr. Fox to get himself, his family, and the rest of the woodland creatures out of the mess he created. As fantastic as Mr. Fox is, the supporting cast makes this a great ensemble piece - there's the sneaky rat (Willem Dafoe), the badger lawyer (Bill Murray) who tries to dissuade Fox from purchasing the tree in the first place, Meryl Streep as Fox's wife, etc. In the capable hands of director Wes Anderson, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" with its stop-motion adventure is a refreshing break from the series of insipid features passing of as ""family"" entertainment these days.

Is this a movie for children? I think it's more of a film for adults and older children - there are no profanities in this film (all the expletives are replaced by the word ""cuss"", e.g. what the cuss? etc, so this needs to be explained to younger children), there is a fair amount of violence as the farmers use all sorts of methods to destroy the animals though it's not bloody or gory; some kissing between Fox and Mrs. Fox, scenes of the adult animals drinking, the farmer smoking etc. Final verdict - a fun movie that will delight the inner child and jaded adult in all of us.",1264896000,,2481,4.610859728506787
3770278,5,B001QOGYBI,"I enjoy a wide range of films. Movies are, and always have been a big part of my everyday life. Every now and then a movie comes along that can only be described as a masterpiece. Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of those films. The dialog was tight and witty, animation style was spot on, the plot was well developed, and the voices fit the characters well. Yes, I know that it was a British book set in an obviously British town and most of the main characters spoke with American accents.  But you must remember....it's comedy, not a historical documentary. The cast did a great job brining these characters to life. I saw this movie several times in the theater and have preordered the Blu-Ray. I can't wait to watch this truly fantastic movie again.",1264636800,,746,4.485294117647059
3770279,5,B001QOGYBI,"When I saw the trailer for Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was unimpressed, but I am a huge Wes Anderson fan, so I decided to give it a shot.

Wow! I am SO glad I did. This film was such a refreshing change for me--it embraces its storybook roots with simple, puppet-show style sets and animation, instead of basically apologizing for the fact that it's animated by using CGI to easily create the smoothest movement possible.

I usually don't laugh much at movies, but this one had me in tears. True, if you prefer less subtle humor, you may not like it, but in my opinion, this is Anderson's greatest film so far--and maybe my new favorite movie.",1262476800,,636,4.427350427350428
3770280,4,B001QOGYBI,"Just saw it this morning.  Here's what I liked.

1. Beautifully different.  Just the look that is.  It's like puppet show and a painting coming to life in front of you.  Just gorgeous.

2. It's not CGI.  I'm getting really weary of CGI movies that are all about gags and CGI tricks and not about the story or the characters.

3. Very character driven by today's standards.  I found myself caring for the main characters right from the get-go, which is not something that happens a lot anymore, sadly.  I really believed Mr. and Mrs. Fox were a married couple, and the family dynamic was very familiar and believable.

4. Great supporting character critters.  Just a lot of fun with all the different animals and their unique abilities and quirks contributing to the story.

5. There was humor, but it didn't come across as trying to be funny all the time.  It's there, and maybe some of it fell flat, but that sort of added to the charm.  Too many of these family CGI type movies try too hard to be funny, and they're not.  Part of humor is that it's unexpected.

6.  The soundtrack.  Just plain fun and the minimalist bluegrass sounding stuff just seemed totally appropriate.  I'm going to be buying some Bobby Fuller Four music soon.

Oh yeah, Phil Seymour made an excellent rendition of Let Her Dance.  Very much like the Bobby Fuller Four version but about 3 minutes and made more recently with better recording quality.  Check it out if you like this song.

Now for the downside:

1.  Was this for kids or not?  At the end of the movie I asked my chidren, who've seen quite a few movies, what the point was or what they remembered, and they didn't say much.  They really didn't seem to like it.  I'm wondering if children under 10 or so even get this movie.  Not that my children are the benchmark for all children, but I was surprised at how little they got out of this movie.

2.  The use of ""cuss"" where cussing would be was clever.  The kids didn't get what they weren't supposed to get, but I think they crossed the line a bit when they used the term ""cluster cuss"".  That's a variant of a deeply crass term used in a short, useless and throwaway scene that didn't even need to be there, and I feel sad for any parents whose kids ask them to decode that one.

Finally, I'm reviewing the movie and not the DVD product.  What if the DVD contains the movie alone and no special features?  Will it have a ""making of"" documentary?  Will there be a commentary track?  Who knows?  Those things make a difference in the value one gets for one's DVD dollar.",1262304000,5,2558,4.394004282655247
3770281,5,B001QOGYBI,"Filmmaker Wes Anderson is a specialist in comedies about the fault lines in the American dream. ""Rushmore"" concerns a prep school student, a middle-aged millionaire, and their romantic rivalry over a woman who doesn't want either of them. ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" examines a family of former prodigies and what happens when their estranged, deadbeat father re-enters their lives, while ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" imagines a Jacques Costeau type adventurer as a combination of Don Quixote and Captain Ahab. Anderson's new film, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" is the story of an aging family man who risks everything to recapture the thrill of his youth. It's set in an imaginary England where all the animal characters talk with American accents, and, along with the steampunk-influenced ""Sherlock Holmes,"" it's one of the two new pictures I've most enjoyed this year.

Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) writes a newspaper column that even his friends don't seem to read, but it provides a comfortable living for his family. The trouble begins when he buys a new home near those of three grotesque farmers: rotund Boggis, dwarfish Bunce, and pencil-thin Bean (voiced by Michael Gambon), the smartest and most dangerous of the three. Mr. Fox, despite his promises to his wife Felicity (voiced to self-possessed perfection by Meryl Streep), reverts to his wild side in a series of nocturnal raids that brings down the wrath of the vindictive trio on himself, his family, and nearly all the wildlife in the area.

Even without all this, there's trouble in the Fox household between the Foxes' sad sack son, Ash, and his visiting cousin Kristofferson, a martial artist, athlete and student of Eastern meditation who outclasses him in just about everything. Ash responds with all the petty adolescent cruelties at his disposal, but he remains basically invisible to his father, a master thief and escape artist who can't understand why his son can't do much more than dress up like a comic book superhero.

The passage of time is an important part of this movie; two human years equals twelve fox years, and Mr. Fox notes that his father died at almost the same age he is now, leading him to wonder if he stopped being true to himself by giving up a life of crime; you get the feeling that he enjoys using the word ""existential"" without knowing what it means. It's underplayed, as all Wes Anderson comedies are underplayed, and the stop motion puppet animation looks, paradoxically, more lifelike than the typical CG animation we're now used to. One reason I find this movie so enjoyable is that it's an absurd, wickedly funny, thoughtful comedy that leaves the viewer time and room to think and savor the many verbal, visual, and musical jokes that pack the film (as opposed to the bludgeoning sitcom stupidity of most recent animated comedies).

I haven't found myself awaiting a home video release this eagerly in years.",1261958400,5,2917,4.971311475409836
3770282,5,B001QOGYBI,"This is in regards to the Theatrical Release not the Blu Ray edition

It is always interesting when your favorite directors take on new material that you would never associate them with. It shows versatility and their unique style to a genre they haven't explored in the film medium.
Wes Anderson has done that with Fantastic Mr. Fox. A wonderful stop motion animated film, something you do not see in these times with CGI dominating the animated world.

Anderson is known for his eccentric characters, wry humor, witty one liners,  and always his themes with family and the rifts that go on in one's family's unit. All his characters in all his films have weaknesses, flaws, fear, ego maniacal, and humble.

So we are introduced to Mr. Fox voiced by George Clooney who is egotistical, sly, conniving... well just like a... Fox! He robs chickens, and he's good at it, it's an adrenaline rush to him, but he gives it all up when Mrs. Fox announces she is pregnant voiced by Meryl Streep. So Mr. fox trades in a life of chicken snatching to Fatherhood/ Domestic life and he is restless, because always thinking always coming up with crazy plans he hasn't soothed that itch to go out and snatch chickens. To satisfy this urge and not let the Mrs. catch on who isn't just some bored housewife who is quite smart and knows what her hubby is up too, Mr. Fox goes for the trifecta and robs three farmers one dealing in chickens, one in hard apple cider and one goose farmer, all ripe for the picking. Anyways as the story progresses Mr. Fox and his ally which animal it is I forget, make way with quit a load of stolen goods. This doesn't bode well for the farmers or Mr. Fox and family and eclectic mix of animal dwellers in the forest, one friend is the badger voiced by Bill Murray. So moving on the three farmers want to exterminate Mr. Fox and family.

Meanwhile as this is going on, Mr. Fox's son voiced by Jason Schwartzman is vying for his affections of his dad by his rival cousin, who is much more athletic, a ladies man, more smooth, and Mr. Fox is smitten with the cousin and this causes young Fox to feel jealously. Where Schwartzman's young fox is just trying to find his niche in the family and a sense of belonging. Then there is Mrs. Fox who is trying to balance the family, keep Mr. Fox's ego in check, but yet putting trust in him that he can save the family and friends in this dire time.

So we go on an adventure as Mr. Fox and family and friends must flee underground from the farmers.

The film has Wes Anderson written all over it even though adapted from a story. Wes Anderson uses all his film techniques you've seen in his previous films, the movie is broken in chapters, close ups of the faces, quick pans, the humor, now Anderson has replaced the curses with the word cuss... it is pure genius, one scene that got a good laugh from the adults in the audience when I saw it was when Mr. Fox is lying in bed and says, ""We are cluster cussed"".It stays true to the PG format yet you still feel you are in an Anderson film, he doesn't make it all cutsie for the kiddies, yes the kids will like it because of the animation and some funny scenes but as an Anderson fan you will like it because of what I have mentioned.  I don't think kids will understand the story. Just like how parents took their kids to see Where the Wild Things Are... great movie but not for kids, even though it got the PG label and parents blindly took them to go see it because they thought it would be ""cute"" and they remember the book... WRONG, first of all Spike Jonze made a great movie with deep underlying themes that most adults would understand not some 6 to 10 year old would.

Anyways I thought the character Mr. Fox had a little Dignan, a little Steve Zissou, and Max Fischer in him, as you remember Dignan was a character is Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket, Steve Zissou in Life Aquatic and Max Fischer in Anderson's great Rushmore.
And in any Wes Anderson film you get a wonderful soundtrack, from the beach boys to the rolling stones among others played out in the movie. Only thing missing from this movie as in all Anderson films is the slow motion shot, all his movies had scene that plays out in slow motion, I don't remember such a scene in this one. I thought the film had a nice 60s vibe to it and a British feel as well.

This is a wonderful film, a must see for any Wes Anderson fan",1261785600,,4394,4.3345498783454985
3770283,5,B001QOGYBI,"When I first heard word of Wes Anderson adapting one of Roald Dahl's books I of course instantly was both interested and concerned.  Being a Houstonian I have always felt inclined to support the work of Houston-born writer/director Wes Anderson.

Thus far I've enjoyed his dry sense of humor; kind of like an Americanized version of British humor...but it is also very adult, sophisticated humor, so I couldn't imagine him doing a family movie.

After seeing the movie I have one thing to say...Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly is FANTASTIC!  Wes Anderson has made one of the best films of 2009; one that is just as good as his other movies, if not being his best yet!  Everything, from voice-actors, to the use of stop animation: this film is perfectly balanced in what is certainly the best comedy of the year.

How did Wes Anderson pull it off?  Well, he honestly didn't make this so much as a kid's movie as he did make another entry in his series of odd-ball comedies- only this time cutting back mature subjects to a PG-rating.  What results is a very mature comedy that doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks or slapstick for laughs (though there is a bit of slapstick for those kids who won't understand the humor in Anderson's dialog).

The story centers on Mr. Fox (voiced by the always entertaining George Clooney), who is the foxiest fox who ever foxed.  An expert chicken thief he likes living dangerously...that is until his lover (voiced by Meryl Streep) becomes pregnant and demands that they settle down.  After getting caught in a fox trap he agrees to her terms that if they survive he shall never steal again.

Two years later (which is far more in fox years) the couple is living in a hole with their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzmen).  Mr. Fox is a newspaper columnist, who is fairly certain no one actual reads his column and is now upset that he won't amount to anything (like his father) so he decides they must move out.  His choice is a tree, but this tree happens to be located next door to the three meanest farmers the animals have ever seen.  His lawyer, Badger (voiced by Anderson regular Bill Murray) tries to talk Fox out of his choice home, but he won't hear it.

After moving to the tree they are joined by their nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson) who quickly becomes Ash's center of jealousy.  Kristofferson is perfect in just about every way, spending his time meditating while practicing yoga, being naturally gifted in sports - everything Ash wishes he was.

But while those trivial matters go on Mr. Fox can't resist the call of the wild, and with his opossum building superintendent, Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) plans a return to his dangerous life of ""cussing with"" the farmers' heads.  At first this starts as simple crimes, but soon the farmers declare war against Mr. Fox and the entire animal populace!  It becomes the job of Fox save everyone from the farmers' wrath...which he caused!

There's also a great (not to mention HILARIOUS) bit involving Willem Dafoe as an insane, finger snapping rat-henchman under the employ of the farmers, but I wouldn't spoil that for the you! You'll have to see the movie to get what I'm talking about.

Fantastic Mr. Fox of course differs from its source material, but for what it is Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great comedy.  I say ""comedy"" instead of ""animation"" or ""Family"" movie because its values really are more comedy oriented than they are trying to entertain an entire group of people.  In fact, the theater I saw this movie in was full of kids under the age of 10 and very seldom did any of them laugh: the humor was just way over their heads, and I won't hold that against them.

For adults and mat kids over the age of 10 or so Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fantasy comedy full of whimsical characters that will leave them chuckling, and quoting its ingenious script long after they've left the theater.  Parents can also approve of the film's message of ""everyone has their own individual talents,"" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.

It won't stand up against a movie like Pixar's Up in a `Best Animated Feature' contest, but then again I doubt it was even trying to.  What the movie does is set out to be a sophisticated comedy - something that is rated PG, but is just as good as any comedy directly aimed at older audiences.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is rated PG but is more adult and sophisticated than this year's smash hit The Hangover.

Fantastic Mr. Fox truly is the most fantastic movie of the year.",1260921600,4,4516,4.62280701754386
