=========================

WANTED: THE SUNDANCE WOMAN

For a TV sequel to the popular 1969 film, ""Wanted: The Sundance Woman"" ain't bad. It came out 8 years later and Katherine Ross still looks great with her inimitable winsome spirit.

THE PLOT: Butch and Sundance are long gone (dead in Bolivia) and Etta Place (Ross) is hiding out as a store clerk in Arizona. A burly detective is on her case and determined to find her (Steve Forrest). When the husband of the couple she was staying with is jailed for harboring a fugitive (Michael Constantine) Etta goes to revolutionary Pancho Villa for help (Hector Elizondo).

I wasn't expecting much from this TV movie; it's too talky, but it won me over. This can be attributed to Ross' charm, a decent cast (also with Stella Stevens and Katherine Helmond), the Old Tucson locations, the team-up with Pancho Villa, quality train sequences and some solid writing with good subtext; for instance, the way Etta does good to her enemy and a character's realization that the criminal he made out to be a monster is not a monster at all.

The film runs 95 minutes.

GRADE B (6.5/10)

PS: There's another sequel to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" called ""Blackthorn,"" released in 2011, starring Sam Shepherd as Butch Cassidy. The outlaw didn't die in that 1908 shootout in Bolivia and is living on a small ranch in the Bolivian wilderness in 1927 where he decides to go back to the USA to meet his son. It's a quality modern Western (see my review for details).

=========================

THE NEW DAUGHTERS OF JOSHUA CABE

Released to TV in 1976 and directed by Bruce Bilson, ""The New Daughters of Joshua Cabe"" chronicles events in Wyoming when homesteader/interim Sheriff Joshua Cabe (John McIntire) is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to hang in thirty days. His three adopted daughters (Louise Williams, Renne Jarrett & Lezlie Dalton) hatch a harebrained scheme to smuggle him out of a nasty cave prison before going to the gallows. Jack Elam plays Uncle Bitterroot, John Dehner the warden and Geoffrey Lewis the neer-do-well. Jeanette Nolan is also on hand.

This was the third in a trilogy of TV movies, the first two being The Daughters of Joshua Cabe (1972) and The Daughters of Joshua Cabe Return (1975). The producers could never get the same people to play the main characters with the exception of Elam returning as Bitterroot from the first film.

The Western locations are actually good and realistic, but they're obviously the same locations used for 70s TV Westerns, like the Kung Fu series. The best part about New Daughters is the likable cast, particularly the three girls, with Louise Williams standing out as the spirited brunette. Lezlie Dalton was on the soap Guiding Light for a couple of years before leaving acting; its nice to see her again.

New Daughters isn't a Western comedy, but rather a lighthearted Western drama. Despite the quality locations and cast, the story (by Margaret and Paul Savage) is thoroughly contrived in the manner of TV show Westerns. If you can handle that and like the cast its fairly entertaining.

The film runs 73 minutes and was shot in Southern California.
