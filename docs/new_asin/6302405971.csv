7825448,4,6302405971,"This is a very good workout video - it is pretty much a more advanced version of her Body Basics with a bit more intensity and is structured very similarly (warm-up, upper body, aerobics, abs, lower body, cool down).  The ""Tone-up"" name is a bit limiting as this has the same toning segments as Body Basics, coupled with aerobics sections for cardio.  As far as the rubber bands, that's a pretty risky gimmick I do not use (they could break and injure you - especially in the face / eyes) and is probably why this video went out of print and isn't still be produced on any of the classic DVD compilations - however this is very easy to get around - you can just use wrist weights or dumbbells easily instead to get the same benefits of the workout - just simulate the effect the rubber bands would have for the upper body workout part.  They are used again for the leg workout but the natural weight of your legs can give you plenty of a working and benefit without those at all - I guess you could use regular leg weights for an added workout if you feel you need to.  A very good all around workout to upgrade to if you plateau using her Body Basics workout video.",1430092800,,1166,4.262443438914027
