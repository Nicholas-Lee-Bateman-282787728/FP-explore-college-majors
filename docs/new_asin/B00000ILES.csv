7910728,5,B00000ILES,One hero made the difference in this story or else I would have been thoroughly depressed that I came from a race that could be unbearably evil.  My friend has seen it twice already.  It's also a love story that is refreshing to see between a Japanese couple in this era.,1392163200,,271,4.294117647058823
7910729,5,B00000ILES,"A new print of the entire series is being shown in a New York theater. Does this mean a new DVD is in the works, somewhere?",1216339200,,123,3.769230769230769
7910730,5,B00000ILES,"Not much to add to the other reviews, except to point out that these films (like all great humanist art) are not only about the tragedy of the human condition, but also about the humour associated with being alive, and the wonder as well. There are many quite funny moments in these films, especially in the first two, but no-one seems to want to mention the comedy aspect of this wonderful cinematic achievement, which is a shame. And while the ending is definitely about as bleak as endings get, the final message is really not about how sad life is, but more about the towering indomitability of the human spirit in sad circumstances. In other words, the measure of a life is not about how it ends, but how it is lived. Possibly the greatest (and most uplifting) film cycle ever made.",1199750400,,787,4.549295774647887
7910731,5,B00000ILES,"This first film in a 9 hour trilogy, by director Masaki Kobayashi, and starring the great Tatsuya Nakadai, this film is a must have [or see] for those who love great Japanese cinema. Or great cinema period! The film deals with the inner turmoil of a man Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai), during the period of Japans occupation of China during World War II. The Japanese Imperial Army's inhumane occupation of Japan, and Kaji's own inner moral turmoil is confronted in a brilliant character development, which in the later episodes will show Kaji as a Japanese soldier who has come face to face with the horror of war. Kaji attempts to overcome the injustice that he sees around him, using his own ethical standards in trying to change a system that he is at odds with.

Kobyashi does a terrific job with this first film exploring the emotional conflict that Kaji undergoes. Yet, Kaji is himself brutalized by the very nation he has sworn allegiance to. He does not desert his homeland, but instead tries to change a system from within. He must be the one who sets an example for others. In this episode, the veiwer sees Kaji as a supervisor in a labor camp in Manchuria, with Chinese laborers. He and his wife (Michiyo Aratama) try to change the horrible conditions of those in forced labor. When Kaji refuses to go along with the brutal system in place, he is tortured and inducted into the Army. The next two parts deal with Kaji's military service, and the wrath he receives from his fellow officers when he tries to instill a more humane sense of ideals with those around him.

Kaji himself will not tolerate what he sees as unethical behavior. The third film deals with Japan's defeat and subsequent capture by soviet soldiers. No matter what the cost, Kaji remains loyal to his true tenets and belief system of justice. He truly is a good man, regardless of the horror and brutality around him. He realizes in the film that tryng to please everyone, pleased no one. He must remain true to his own values and beliefs. This is a great film, and worthy to be called a masterpiece of cinema. The film is based on director Kobayashi's own experiences, and as the veiwer you will not find this a happy film, but very bleak, however, it explores the nature of one individual who tries to make a difference. I highly recommend this film to everyone, it is a great film. [Stars: 5+]",1166486400,4,2369,4.598108747044917
7910732,5,B00000ILES,"It's always amusing to witness over and over again the way some people try to apply a work of great art to a banal situation, like the one Reviewer, who apparently got overwhelmed by the media to such an extent as to lose a sense of proportion, significance, relevance, etc. What is Abu Ghraib? Nothing in the middle of nowhere, blown up and out of all proportion to reality by the media and dumped upon the mindless public, hungry for mass entertainment. If one wanted to make a more relevant comparison, he or she had better turned to the labor camps in the present day North Korea or Cuba. This movie is a work of art, the hype about Abu Ghraib, in contrast, is a shameless garbabe.",1143590400,7,685,4.4015748031496065
7910733,5,B00000ILES,"This movie is the first from a 10 hour trilogy, detailing Kaji's (a Japanese man) moral and physical passage, from being a warden of sorts, to the front lines, and finally to a Russian prison camp. Through these three movies, we get a sense of Kaji, as a truly beatiful soul, always torn between two equally unappealing destinations: trapped in a perpetual catch 22. No Greater Love shows him reluctantly aiding the Japanese war machine, while simaltaneously refusing to take part in it.

Kaji does not want to go to the front lines. He is about to be married to a beautiful woman, he has a great job, and he is against the idea of war as a general principle. Fortunately, his boss at the steel company offers him a comprimise: he doesn't need to go to the front lines if he relocates to a Manchurian iron mine and serves as the labor coordinator...

It sounds like a dream come true for Kaji; he can now ensure that workers' rights are not being violated and gets to spend time with his new wife. But then, a Japanese army general drops off 600 Chinese prisoners at the mine. Kaji does not want to take them and act as their oppressor, but he has little choice. He tries to gain the trust of the prisoners but because he is Japanese, this is a nearly impossible task. When the prisoners start escaping from within the electrocuted barbed wire, both Kaji's job and life is put on the line.

So, why is this 3 and a half hour movie the masterpiece that it is? Apart from being visually stunning in remarkably well shot black and white, the movie throws the most clean soul into a cesspool of dirt... everything in the movie is dirty: the landscape is constantly obscured by sand (dust) storms, the Chinese workers who help the Japanese are scumbags, and the Japanese authorities are tyrants. Kaji is forced to stand against attack from all sides, from both his friends and from his enemies.

But, alas, he is only human. He can only do so much to protect the well-being of the prisoners, to raise the production quotas, to take care of his lonely and bored, yet still loving, wife. When something bad happens at the mine he is blamed by both the prisoners and the authorities: called a Japanese tyrant by the prisoners and a sympathizer by the authorities. He tries to balance, but he cannot stretch himself that far. When some of the prisoners are executed, he manages to save the lives of some of them, but gets blamed for the loss of life of the others.

But, nobody else does anything to help. Even those that admire him are working against him. He is attacked for not doing enough, when he did more than everyone else. As a beautiful soul he is the perfect scapegoat, and he suffers for his purity.

Though the movie is long, it was never boring. Each scene was substantial and perfectly set up the next scene and the one after that. Every scene was suspensful as well as heartfelt and combined to create a very good viewing experience, a true connection and understanding of the main character. There was very little wrong with this movie: watch it, experience it.",1127606400,10,3069,4.52072072072072
7910734,5,B00000ILES,"This is a masterpiece, no doubt. Nakadai gives a truly legendary performance. But be warned... this is the bleakest film I have ever seen. Not a shred of optimism is allowed to remain, no spark of decency gets a reward. Every effort of the hero of the story to maintain his humanity amidst the total degradation imposed by the Japanese upon the Chinese during the occupation of Manchuria and the later War meets with abject failure.

Do not watch this film if you keep fire arms in the house.",1111017600,8,492,4.52808988764045
7910735,5,B00000ILES,"The acting is inspiring, the script gut-wrenchingly convincing and the cinematography on a par with that of other Japanese classics. This three-part series tells it like it was without cliches and the impact is restrained enough to last for three hours in each episode. Kaji, an idealistic Japanese man with socialist inclinations is embroiled in the fascist culture of WWII Japan. His struggle as a conscientious objector has universal overtones: the conflicts between mass mania and personal integrity, between nationalistic tribalism and humanistic sensitivity, between the pack mentality of bullying and the vulnerability of someone who stands up for what is right.",1092873600,12,669,5.568627450980392
7910736,5,B00000ILES,"It is rare when an episode of national history can be interpreted without the burden of illusions, both obsolete and nostalgic. And this is perhaps one of the great strengths of Masaki Kobayashi's The Human Condition, a nine-hour epic about Japan's occupation of China during the Second World War. The trilogy begins with an attack on the inhuman practices within the Japanese Army and ends with a bitter denunciation of Stalinism by the would-be-socialist hero, Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai), a Japanese soldier who has confronted the horrid face of war and found it unyielding. In grand Dostoyevskian flourishes, Kobayashi suggests the impossibility of an individual altering the ethical standards of a social system. Kaji, driven by an idealized vision of Japan redeemed by social reform, tries to overcome injustice and exploitation during a military conquest based solely on these principles. Brutalized by the very country he defends, Kaji refuses to desert, for desertion implies relinquishing responsibility for his own homeland. Kaji's heroism lies in this exacting refusal to abandon Japan or his humanity. Part One finds Kaji working as a supervisor in a forced labor camp in southern Manchuria where he and his wife (Michiyo Aratama) attempt to better the dreadful lot of the enslaved Chinese workers. Kaji is accused of dissent, tortured, then inducted into the army. In Part Two, Kaji is equally appalled by the horrendous treatment afforded recruits. Given the rank of officer, he tries to install more humane procedures but only succeeds in attracting the ire of his fellow officers. By Part Three, the Japanese army is being routed by superior Russian troops. Fleeing to the south, Kaji is captured by the Soviet army and imprisoned. Here, he learns the bitter truth of the Red Army as liberators. Kobayashi's The Human Condition can be viewed as a single aesthetic entity, complete in its sweep of historical events and visual stylizations. The gargantuan undertaking to dramatize the wilful ironies of the Manchurian campaign never compromises Kobayashi's ability to define the human scale of injustice. Standing-in for the director, Kaji says, ""Minor facts ignored by history can be fatal to the individual."" It is Masaki Kobayashi's recognition of ""minor facts"" that joins the poetic to the journalistic in a scathing epic about the cruelties of war.",990835200,36,2364,5.273209549071618
7910737,5,B00000ILES,"When Kobayashi undertook the immense project of filming Junpei Gomikawa's popular wartime novel (not, as an earlier viewer stated, by Shohei Ooka -  who wrote the otherwise magnificent Fires on the Plain, later filmed by  Ichikawa) he had been a director for only six years but had already proven  himself as a director of ""problem"" films, tackling uncomfortable  subjects with a straightforward candor.  With 'The Human Condition' he  emerged as one of Japan's master filmmakers.  This trilogy of films is  something on the order of Claude Lanzmann's film 'Shoah.'  It documents  events which Japan has yet to come to terms with - atrocities committed by  the Imperial Army in China and Manchuria.  Along with Ichikawa's 'Harp of  Burma' and 'Fires on the Plain,' Kobayashi's 'The Human Condition' was made  at precisely the right moment in Japan, when the war generation had the  resources to look back at the war with enough honesty to reveal the full  extent of Japan's defeat, a subject which is remains disturbing even today.",967248000,9,1031,5.0476190476190474
