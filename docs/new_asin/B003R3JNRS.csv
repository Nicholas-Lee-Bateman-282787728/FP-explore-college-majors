8403167,1,B003R3JNRS,"I recently watched Vol. 32 and enjoyed it quite a bit, but my one star review is meant for VIZ and not this particular DVD.  I am currently viewing Vol. 33 via Netflix and have discovered a big mistake.  Vol. 32 contains episodes 132-135.  Vol. 33 contains episodes 134-137.  So as you can plainly see, once Vol. 33 comes out, you will be paying for two episodes that you already bought on the previous disc.  Just thought I would make everyone aware.",1328572800,3,451,4.451219512195122
8403168,4,B003R3JNRS,"Saw this via Netflix rental, but seems like this has been out for some time and am eagerly awaiting Vol. 33 and beyond.
The plot advances a little bit forward.

I like the hint at future romantic chemistry between Karin & Capt. Hitsugaya.  Karin is definitely mature beyond her years.
(well, all of the Bleach characters are, for that matter.)

Also interesting is Orihime developing feelings for Ichigo, and starting to feel pangs of jealousy towards Rukia, whom she complains has ""such great chemistry"" with Ichigo (indeed, the ongoing, unresolved sexual tension between Rukia and Ichigo is one of the main things driving the series and fan interest...)

But this DVD is just the start of the Hueco Mundo arc; You'll have to read the manga if you want to know what happens next before the next few DVDs come out.",1303516800,2,814,4.75177304964539
8403169,4,B003R3JNRS,"This like many bleach titles listed here on Amazon is actually in English though Amazon lists it as being in Japanese.
If ever in doubt I refer to Wikipedia's list of bleach episodes [...] and look under region 1 release dates.",1289692800,5,227,4.560975609756097
