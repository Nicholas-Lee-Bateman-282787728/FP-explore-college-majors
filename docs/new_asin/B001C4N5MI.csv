3505450,5,B001C4N5MI,"Cesar Millan is truly The Dog Whisperer! He understands dogs and how to communicate with them. These videos are a wonderful way for you to start understanding, communicating and leading your own dog.",1231286400,4,199,5.0606060606060606
3505451,4,B001C4N5MI,"This was an interesting DVD.  I feel this will be helpful especially when bringing a new pet home.  The DVD's were done concisely and were not too long in viewing length.  Some of things Cesear says in the show are more fully explained in these DVD's.  I have always believed in dealing with dogs that humans are ""the boss"" and Cesear has a great way of showing how to do it so the dogs understand it.  Too bad he doesn't teach parents how to be ""the boss"" for their children!!!!",1227571200,24,479,4.277777777777778
3505452,5,B001C4N5MI,"This dvd set was very enlightening and opened up a whole new world to me - the mind of a dog!  I watched Volume 3 first because we brought home a new puppy 2 months ago.  Fortunately, our puppy has the right energy for me and my family,  The puppy training tips were helpful.  Volumes 1 and 2 give clear explanations of behavior and we already see what we've been doing wrong since we brought our puppy home.  No wonder our puppy wasn't connecting with us and not listening!  Cesar Millan is a genius, so entertaining and I love his dog impersonations!  I recommend this video set to anyone who is considering adding a dog to their home or to change bad behavior in a dog you already have.  We will also be using Millan's techniques on our somewhat aggressive 4 year old Chihuahua (she acts exactly like that Jack Russell in the video!)",1226707200,23,836,4.383116883116883
3505453,5,B001C4N5MI,"Cesar is not only giving recipe how to do, but explain the idea behind the recommandations, and once I picked up the principles, I was able to obtain a good relationship with my actual dog. I would say that nobody should have a dog without first looking many times at those videos. In fact, I had to give a dog that I expect now that if I would have seen those videos before, I would still have that dog with me. Thanks a lot for all those dogs that might have a better family to live with.",1225324800,14,490,4.061855670103093
3505454,1,B001C4N5MI,"Dogs deserve humane treatment, and that is not what Mr. Milan's training gives them.  Even aggression does not need to be treated with force and outdated training methods. Granted, the show is quite popular, but that doesn't mean the techniques are humane or should be done at home.

The American Humane Association has written the following about his show:

""The training tactics featured on Cesar Millan's `Dog Whisperer' program are inhumane, outdated and improper.""

Another excerpt about the ""Dog Whisperer"" TV show: ""It also does a disservice to all the show's viewers by espousing an inaccurate message about what constitutes effective training and appropriate treatment of animals.""",1225152000,6,690,5.420560747663552
3505455,2,B001C4N5MI,"Save your money, Cesar is just selling DVD'S and not giving enough information to do the training your self. I bought $45 worth of his DVD'S and won't buy any more. He does not train you to do the training and refers training to professionals instead of teaching you how to do it yourself.",1223683200,10,289,4.37037037037037
3505456,5,B001C4N5MI,"Our family was fortunate and blessed enough to acquire two wonderful Coton De Tulear puppies.  We tried several books, videos and dvds to help us raise the puppies properly.  Some helped, some did not. A basic fundamental principle seemed to be missing in each one we tried.  Then we discovered Cesar Milan. The concept we were missing was a simple one: Cesar's term ""pack leader"".  Since purchasing and renting from our local library every piece of  Cesar Milan media we could find, our relationship with our puppies has blossomed.  This 3 DVD set is a great place to start.  Cesar's books are fine, but it's like reading how to ride a bike or hit a baseball; books make it difficult to visualize Cesar's concepts.  Plus Cesar himself is someone who needs to be seen.  He's calm, controlled, loving  and totally in  charge of the dogs.  For anyone who wants to ""maximize the potential"" of the relationship they have with their dog(s), I give this set my highest recommendation. As an aside, Cesar's techniques have helped with my children too!  Add this to your cart ASAP, you and your dog will not regret it!",1222128000,48,1110,4.689119170984456
3505457,5,B001C4N5MI,"We started following Cesar's methods two years ago when we bought a new puppy.  I had owned many dogs over the years, and thought I knew what I was doing when it came to training, but once we began adopting Cesar's methods it put everything in a new perspective.  Cesar teaches you how to be the pack leader, and it is miraculous the impact it has on the dog.  He helps you understand dogs, and once you do it becomes very easy to mold them into the ideal pet and companion. And his mantra of ""calm assertive energy"" is a great lesson for life - not just in how you interact with your pet. Using his methods we have molded our puppy into a terrific, happy, disciplined, calm companion - and I now have the best relationship I have ever had with an animal. I strongly recommend this series for anyone that has a dog or is considering getting a dog - or even if you have to interact with dogs.  In fact, before learning from Cesar my wife was afraid of dogs, and now that she understands them it has added a new dimension to her life and alleviated all her fears.  This is a great collection!",1221609600,83,1090,4.221153846153846
3505458,2,B001C4N5MI,Cesar has some basic pointers but I had hoped to learn more in 3 volumes.  His TV show give the same pointers and the videos.,1368748800,,125,4.0

3505460,3,B001C4N5MI,I learned some from these cd's. I guess they were a little too basic. I passed them on to my son. Hopefully it will help him with a few issues he is having with his dogs.,1358812800,,170,3.75
3505461,5,B001C4N5MI,"I really like Cesar and have been a fan for a while. When I got a puppy I immediately order this. I wanted to learn how to really command my dog, and have my dog respect me. In this series Cesar teaches you how to become ""leader of the pack"" so the dog will respect you and follow your commands. I'm happy I ordered this as there is some stuff that is pretty obvious after Cesar says it, but isn't always in the forefront of your thoughts when you're training a new dog. Definitely glad I order this as my pup and I have a great relationship now!",1354752000,3,546,4.064814814814815
3505462,5,B001C4N5MI,"Cesar did a great job in helping me understand my role in caring for a dog. By better understanding my dog and his needs, I was better able to really provide him an environment that supports him, not just me. Watching the seasonal episodes, I learned about certain dog behavior and how Cesar would handle the problem, usually the owners, and I began to see the pattern of general dog behavior and needs. This series helps the human to understand the dogs backround and what they need to be balanced, which means in the end....everyone understands their role in the family (pac). Cesar didn't make the job of training easy....he made it understandable,which allowed me the ability to enjoy the process of getting to know my dog and what HE needed from me to feel secure.
Anyone that has a dog or thinking of getting a dog would be wise to review the concepts and thoughts that Cesar lays out. My biggest take away was an obvious concept....dogs are not people, they are dogs....then why do so many treat them like people? Cesar helped me understand the importance of being a pac leader which helped me truly care for my dog.
It is a great gift to anyone...especially yourself.

3505463,1,B001C4N5MI,"I can appreciate the value of trying to save a buck, but seriously Cesar, you couldn't have had these manufactured professionally? My DVD player is maybe 3 years old, and these DVDs don't run in it. I have been able to burn DVD slideshows off my computer and they run in my player just fine. I checked and double checked that the DVDs I ordered are the correct format, so that's not the problem. Great, I can watch the DVDs on my computer, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of ordering a DVD? I could have just signed up for his online videos.",1255392000,2,545,4.300970873786408
3505464,4,B001C4N5MI,"Very good set and well worth the money. Some of the examples to me were too condensed and that's where the skeptics come in. The man knows his stuff and groups like National Geographic sponser him so that is as good as it gets.
It is also a main example of training people! not always dogs.

Very much recommended. A+",1254355200,2,317,4.283333333333333
3505465,3,B001C4N5MI,"i was super excited to try out this dvd set, hoping it would give me tons of tips and pointers on how to mold my companion into a more well behaved specimen...

there is alot of talking about the psychology of dogs and i don't feel that i actually learned anything from it, aside from just not letting my dog pull ahead of me on the leash.

not that it isn't interesting to watch, but each case with each dog is different and its hard to know just from watching ceaser with 3 different dogs, how to put that into practice with your own pet.

save yourself the $30/$40 bucks and invest in personal training instead... i guess thats what im going to have to do!",1253750400,2,659,4.214285714285714
3505466,3,B001C4N5MI,"Got a new pup and bought the series for leads on how to raise it right.

Its a pretty good series with live examples - featuring grown dogs. The last DVD has very good chapter on adopting a pet - absolutely excellent tips and a must for folks considering adopting and getting a new pup.

Only thing I found a bit lacking was on housebreaking. Wish the chapters were a bit longer and had more tips. Except for that its a worthwhile purchase. Particularly ideal for time pressed folks.",1250640000,4,483,4.415730337078652

3505468,5,B001C4N5MI,"This set isn't an end-all for dog training nor a guarantee for a good working relationship with your dog. However, I got a lot out of this video as far as general attitude goes with dog ownership. The DVD on choosing a dog is also GREAT - I wish more people would watch that one before they went to get a dog! I absolutely put that one to use when I was going to shelters for months looking for a dog. There are so many 'cute' dogs; this DVD will help you pick the one that's right for you though. And I have to say: the dog I finally adopted (4 months later) is WONDERFUL! Our energy levels match perfectly, so my level of activity suits his exercise needs and he's content following me through my day-to-day and does so calmly and cooperatively. But again, and as Cesar will tell you: the DVD is NOT dog training. You still need to do regular obedience training in order to be a really competent and successful dog owner.",1248825600,4,923,4.25
3505469,5,B001C4N5MI,"If you are looking for a basic traing tape, this is not it. If you are looking for information about relating wit your dog, preventing and correcting issues, or creating a happy dog home, this is the DVD set.

The first DVD covers Cesar's ideas about energy. The DVD reminds us that no matter how much we love our dogs, they are dogs. It is our energy that tells the dog how to react and respond. I thought about the way we raise teenagers the entire time I was watching this.

The second DVD deals with three problem dogs, and reinforces the concept of energy and being the head dog. Finally, the last DVD covers ways to deal with deal with behavior using ""head of pack"" energy.

I have trained many dogs and been frustrated by dog classes. This video assured me that I could train my dog wihout using a dog class. Every trainer has a different technique. This video leveled the field. I encourage you to watch it.

As a last note, my husband and I changed the way we walk our dog and that has changed her behavior.",1248134400,6,1016,4.303664921465969
3505470,3,B001C4N5MI,"Got this DVD after my wife wouldn't stop about how great Ceaser is.
So purchased the DVD for about $40.  This DVD will not show you how to make you dog sit by you saying ""sit"" nor will it teach your dog to lay when you say ""lay"".

Ceaser teaches you to ""Be the pack leader""  This means the dog sees you as the leader and does what you want him/her to do.  This DVD creates an excellent FOUNDATION to teach your dog to ""sit"" when you say ""sit""

Biggest complaint - Not enough examples of training. DVD 2 was the most practicat.
HIGHLY recommended for people not sure if they want a dog or for people that have never owned a dog before.

+ Good base to train you dog to follow your lead
+ Good for first time dog owners
+ Good for understanding ""bad"" dog behavior""
+ Good to level set all people who will be living with the dog
+ Teaches you how and why to walk your dog
- Not good for teaching your dog tricks (play dead)
- DVD's are really short!  I think it can fit all on 1 DVD",1248134400,36,979,3.9390862944162435
3505471,5,B001C4N5MI,"The interesting thing about watching Cesar Millan in action is that -- like any true master -- he makes his art/science of dog psychology look so simple and easy!!  In fact, the basic rules he talks about really ARE simple, because he has distilled a lifetime's worth of experience into them.

The depth of his understanding is phenomenal.  Since his approach is so ""low-key"", you get glimpses of his encyclopedic knowledge of breeds, behaviors, health issues, etc., only occasionally, but that makes them all the more brilliant.

I've learned so much from Cesar in the past few years, just from watching episodes of ""The Dog Whisperer"", and have UN-learned much of what I thought I knew about dogs.  If you want to improve your relationship with your dog, this 3-volume set is well worth your time.",1246147200,4,799,4.845588235294118
3505472,5,B001C4N5MI,I have had many dogs. Finally with our newest addition I bought this dvd prior to her arrival. I would have made so many mistakes. Cesar is a godsend and this dvd made training so easy this time.  A must have.,1245974400,2,209,4.097560975609756
3505473,5,B001C4N5MI,"I knew of Cesar's reputation and desperately needed some idea of how to manage a new puppy in our house.  Although I didn't gain any tips about house training like I was hoping for I did apply Cesar's training methods by walking my puppy every day.  She is a much better behaved animal, and I'm losing weight and gaining more energy.  She is less than 6 months old now and can sit, lie down, beg, speak, stay, and waits until I've gone through the door before coming in behind me.  We're still struggling with the house breaking issues but overall that is much better too.  You owe it to yourself as well as your best friend to buy these discs, actually sit down and watch them with your family and friends, and try it out.",1245024000,2,723,4.325925925925926
3505474,5,B001C4N5MI,"I have 2 wonderful dogs who are well trained as far as sit, stay, down, and come.  I have a 1 year old terrier mix who is very fear aggressive.  By using Cesar's techniques I have been able to slowly teach her to allow people in the house and with 6 kids worth of friends, that amounts to a big change.  I have also been able to slowly teach her not to growl or bark at people we pass on the street when walking.  I have not seen these videos as yet since I just ordered them today but am looking forward to their arrival.  Although treat training works for basic commands, I believe that in most situations where one is dealing with an animal with bad or annoying behaviors, treats are just a distraction and do not address the root of the behavior.  I want to thank Cesar for sharing his insights into the reasons for the behaviors and the best way for the dog to get through their issues.  People can rationalize issues, dogs cannot.  Let's stop treating our dogs like children and remember they are animals.  Thank you Cesar for teaching us to let our dogs be animals!",1243987200,5,1072,4.293532338308458
3505475,5,B001C4N5MI,"This is a really fascinating DVD series by Cesar Millan. I had heard a lot about Cesar, however had never read his books or seen his TV show.

When I started watching the DVD's ... I couldn't stop and watched them all in one sitting!... it was amazing seeing how influential being the pack leader has on a dogs behavior.

You will really enjoy watching and learning how to have a well behaved pet!

Wish you the best!

3505476,4,B001C4N5MI,"I love this guy -watched all his episodes. Have always owned a dog. After watching his show I realized my approach was all wrong! I used to use commands and raise my voice trying to correct unwanted behavior!  We put our poodle to sleep last year and have very young children.(BTW-he was a great dog with our kids-would just bark a bit too much once in a while at strangers coming to the house.)  We are now searching for a dog for our family and was more focused on the breeds ""recommended for small children"", small in size and hypoallergenic coat. This series helped me see something the tv show did not- I had not even consider the ""energy"" of the individual dog.  I was SO focused on what would be a good fit in regards to breed only.  I am excited to find our new dog in the coming months.  I was able to put my emotions aside and not adopt of couple of dogs that really needed a home.  It would have been a poor fit for both our family and the dog.  I feel CONFIDENT I have the ""tools"" or should I say calm assertive energy to find the right dog that fits our family lifestyle and energy.  Thanks CESAR! The reason I give only 4 stars is that Cesar shows dogs with walking, jumping on furniture and barking issues but only addresses one of the issues in each dog.  (I know his methods will help in other areas too but I would have like to see him handling a dog on furniture.  I know he would ""claim"" the furniture but how.)",1242000000,4,1431,4.170909090909091

The third of the series, Your New Dog: First Day and Beyond is an absolute MUST for families considering adoption. What to look for at the shelter, gaging energy of oneself, being realistic when looking into those sad eyes at the shelter. Never adopt because you feel sorry for the dog, ect. Also outlined are adopting from Reputable Rescue organizations...how to know the difference, are they licensed? Do they hold a 501c3? and lastly how to find a reputable Breeder, what to look for ect.
