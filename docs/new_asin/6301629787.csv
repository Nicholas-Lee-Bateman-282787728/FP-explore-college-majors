340893,2,6301629787,"The video and sound are scrumptious, Lehar's music is as appealing and lively as ever, and the supporting cast is fine.  The costumes, scenery, and choreography are marvelous.

HOWEVER -- Sutherland was almost 62 when she did this, and was no longer physically or musically worthy of this role.  Her voice is weak, wavering, off-key.  She is too heavy and lacking in energy to be a sprightly merry widow.  This might be tolerable in a cameo appearance for old time's sake, but not in the starring role that overshadows all other parts.  I want my money back.

Why did Sutherland ever go along with releasing this blemish on her heavenly legacy of masterpieces?  Did she long to experience once more the intoxication of the fawning crowds and adulation her name alone might bring?  Was it money?  Even if Sutherland and hubby Bonynge (the conductor) were contentedly rich from their many deserving efforts of previous decades, others might have pressed for one more big profit.  Too bad.

Clearly, it must have been Sutherland's star power and birthplace, not the actual performance, which had the crowd in her hometown (Sydney) cheering and applauding so wildly.  I cannot believe that they (or any knowledgeable reviewer with normal hearing) could honestly enjoy Sutherland's embarrassing performance, which someone along the way should have withheld from release.

UPDATE: We no longer have much reason to buy this DVD.  Not only is the San Francisco Opera's four-star English performance now on the market, but five-star versions in German (the original language almost always fits the music and rhythm better) are available.  The Zrich production (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lehar-Die-lustige-Witwe/dp/B0002TXT2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lehar: Die lustige Witwe</a>) starring Dagmar Schellenberger, Rodney Gilfry, Piotr Beczala, Gabriel Bermudez, and Franz Welser-Mst is marvelous, and I bought it, but my fave is the 2005 centennial performance (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lehar-Die-Lustige-Witwe/dp/B000SQJ2EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lehar - Die Lustige Witwe</a>) from the Mrbisch Lake Festival with Margarita de Arellano, Mathias Hausmann, Elisabeth Starzinger, Harald Serafin, and Marwan Shamiyeh, produced by ORF, the Austrian Radio & TV network.  Both German-language versions come with subtitles and a good printed synopsis, although the wonderful music and singing matched with the visual treats are quite sufficient without precise understanding of all the words.  Translations of this work must be highly approximate anyway, struggling with rhyme, meter, and Austrian German multilingual wordplay (with at least three other languages).  The Mrbisch and Zrich casts perform with the chemistry and sexy energy that the mess from Sydney lacks.  Without some special reason, purchase of Bonynge & Sutherland's DVD from Opera Australia (not to be confused with Austria) would misuse funds better spent elsewhere, especially for the Mrbisch and Zrich versions.",1011657600,41,3061,5.8979591836734695

Ignoring this condition, the operette itself was shown marvelously in colors, scenery and costumes. Also the ballet and dancing give us much enjoyment too watch this video. It was a real amusement to see the funny situation and words, as it is sung in English and quite understandable.

After watching it together for the very first time from start to finish, we were all hooked. The music and dancing were excellent, the costume and set designs were absolutely beautiful, and the storyline is sweet, humorous, and uplifting.

340938,3,6301629787,"This Merry Widow ballet is fun and a much deeper look into the courtship/love between two people than the original musical.  Instead of being distracted by the fortunes of a tiny country we see a couple with a history collide, argue, trick each other, and finally come together all at Viennese waltz time mirrored by another couple, really a triple.  It is wonderfully deep and fluffy at the same time.  I rented it and would add it to my collection but the video quality looks 1970ish at best.  How about an HD revival Canadian National Ballet?",1386633600,,545,4.645833333333333

I keep it on during the day a lot of times when I'm working around the house, because of the music, but then I will be drawn into peeking at the dancing, and then I will just sit down and watch a whole act!  Kain is a ballet star from Canada and John Meehan is Australian.  No regular movie can beat the casting of the tall, megahandsome prince and the gorgeous rich widow, or the comic king and his delicate daughter, the princess.  A huge supporting ballet corps, synchronized to the max, in three acts with choreography you won't be able to take your eyes off.",1376956800,,708,4.222222222222222
340940,5,6301629787,"I have seen a version of this ballet in person and also have a copy of the Australian ballet's version on DVD which I very much enjoy. The Australian Ballet's DVD features a very well-cast & attractive group of dancers, and a bright clear picture quality. It is a top-notch production.

Because of that I was not expecting to like this Canadian Ballet version quite so much, after all, the picture quality is not as splendid (it looks like a transfer from a videotape). But within minutes of watching I was taken up by the glorious score and intelligent camera-work capturing the important mimed gestures that tell the story clearly. The audience laughed, I laughed and at a certain point became aware there was a smile on my face, and on a recent re-watch I even got a welling of tears happening. The Merry Widow ballet is a production that doesn't feature any spell-binding or innovative choreography (with such a score it surely could) but that doesn't mean it's dull to watch, it's always trying to tell a story and this filmed version really does that, the acting by the cast is really great and the camera seems to know where to be to capture those telling moments.

It is an easy ballet of comedy, glamour & romance and fulfills on that promise. A huge plus is the beauty of the score, a delicious swirling mix of all the familiar Lehar tunes from the much-loved operetta that intermingle at tempos not able to be deployed in the opera version, it's an invigorating creation.

On balance and even though I am Australian, I would have to say that I get more pure enjoyment from the Canadian production DVD (at least the Count Danilo is an Australian dancer) but saying that, before I had seen it I really did think the Australian Ballet version I owned was stupendous.

The only down-side I would put (and this applies to MANY ballet DVD's) is that there is no written explanation of the story for novices to refer to, although I guess most of us can now educate ourselves through google & wikipedia & such.",1375142400,,2013,4.583333333333333

It was an operetta written by Franz Lehar in Austria in 1905, and it ran for over 700 performances in London. It was also very popular in Berlin during and following World War I. This is not slender women in tutus... a whole troupe of army officers dance the Czarda and Mazurka, for example. Furthermore, the cast is able to tell the story without saying a word.

340966,5,6301629787,"Filmed during a live performance 3 February, 1988, within Sydney's justly esteemed opera house, Franz Lehar's Merry Widow is sung here by soon to be retired Joan Sutherland, in addition to a splendid supporting cast, with Richard Bonynge leading his established pick-up orchestra, here dubbed The Elizabethan Philharmonic, in an outstanding rendition of Lehar's scoring for an evergreen operetta that depicts in spirit and particulars Belle &Eacute;poque Paris.  From the original, a stage play of intrigue within high society that debuted in 1861, WIDOW (Lustige Witwe) is adapted wonderfully well under the direction of Lotfi Mansouri for this production made for Australian television that includes enormously agreeable ""business"" and choreography in support of the vocal soloists who act their parts in pleasing fashion for the familiar Christopher Hassall English language translation, from which one finds that only Act III differs substantially from the standard libretto, although the entire work's origins do frequently seem to be grounded at D'Oyly Carte rather than in Vienna.  Several critical observers have stated that, at 61 years, Sutherland is too old to play this part of Anna Glawari, ""The Merry Widow"", additionally commenting upon her prognathousness and girth, and it is manifest that the diva does not readily rise to her feet from a sitting position.  Nonetheless, she is palpably comfortable in the role, and it is clear that her musicality is as estimable as ever.  Indeed, the only obvious clinker here comes from below the boards, within the orchestra's string section.  Although never sylphlike, Sutherland's musical career has been aptly advanced by husband/coach/manager Bonynge (who certainly knew a good thing when he heard one) and opera lovers the world over have gladly sanctioned Coleridge's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to place the soprano firmly into her most successful characterizations, each of which her followers have greeted with idolization.  A house filled to capacity and ripe with esteem for Sutherland as a national treasure, evinces its satisfaction during balloon popping curtain calls, after previously halting the action often with its applause, notably following Sutherland's ardent show-stopping rendering of ""Vilja"", sung amid opulently created period ornamentation.  Despite Sutherland's accomplished turn as Anna, the evening belongs to tenor Ronald Stevens who, as male lead Danilo Danilovitch, captures each of his scenes through his gusto.  The striking soprano Anne-Maree McDonald sings well and acts gracefully as Valencienne, while other supporting cast members are, for the most part, at least proficient.  The WIDOW's narrative has been in a continuing condition of flux since its inception and this film's alternate English translation has been particularly favoured in Australia for many years.  Directed with exhilaration and designed with a refined eye for detail, this whimsical musical play is certain to be welcomed into an operetta lover's cinema library.  Both VHS and DVD versions offer first-class visual and sound quality and each includes a leaflet of synopsis that also lists all involved with the production.",1246406400,4,3196,5.609958506224066
340967,5,6301629787,"Just as Romeo and Juliet works in both opera (Gounod) and ballet (Prokofiev), so The Merry Widow works in both genres.  The odds are, of course, improved by the use of Lehar's music in both.  The son of a band master, Lehar will not be confused with Beethoven, but those who love to wallow unashamedly in sentimental romance will appreciate the wholesomeness of his music.  And the ballet offers something the operetta does not: a visual grace which reveals another dimension to the music.  My copy is in full-screen format and suffers from no recording problems.

340970,3,6301629787,"I didn't like it, but the audience in Australia certainly did.  Sutherland sang only one thing (in my opinion) poorly, and that was I think the last number in the show, what is commonly called The Merry Widow Waltz.  She sang it in her ""low voice"" (to take an expression from Kiri Te Kanawa) and I didn't like it.  The rest of it (what there WAS of it!) was wonderful.  Too much dialogue.  Too much farce (it was stupid).  I've heard several different versions of this score, and except a few tunes, they all seem to have different songs in them.  Which reminds me, my preference (even over Sutherland) is Studer's CD of this show.  Glorious!  I may be mistaken, but I think, in fact am almost positive, that some of the songs were cut (to make room for that boring, idiotic dialogue?  And what was the point of all the dancing, the choreography of which was NOT particularly enthralling?).  Finally, it was a pleasure, a treasure to hear Sutherland talk in English at great length, she is one of my favorite people, and now at last I know what her speaking voice sounded like.  The English lyrics were pedestrian, and they might as well have left it all in German it was so hard to understand what anyone was saying.  I liked the 3rd act the best.  And I knew I was in trouble (like a dish of cold water in the face) when Danilo spoke instead of singing his first number.  Bleah!",1093651200,11,1380,4.377952755905512

This is a review of the Merry Widow ballet with Karin Kain on Blu-Ray
The ad states the Blu Ray is for European Players.  That is not true, it is universal.
The performance was recorded for TV in 1987.  The video has the quality of a TV picture of that time.
Best to watch it on a smaller TV as it is like a VHS tape.  The sound is good though.
The ballet performance is fun to watch, the sets are beautiful, wonderful dancing, and the music
is of course enjoyable.  (Great background music for a special dinner).
Note that this is the first review of the Blu-Ray.

7813337,5,6301629787,"Despite Joan Sutherland being a little matronly for the role of the Young Widowed Millionairess, I had loads of fun watching this production.

Joan Sutherland is really the highlight of this DVD. Despite her age, and her voice being a little past it's prime, Joan's speaking voice is silvery and she has a very charming air to her, and she is a joy to watch in a cheery role, with a lot of dialogue as opposed to a tragic sung through heroine. A very good change in pace. Her voice reaches soaring high notes in certain parts, which is her trademark, and it's still thrilling. The audience is quite enthusiastic and I could feel it.

The production itself is gorgeous, and intimate. The Costumes are fantastic, and glitzy, what more could you want from it? (Maybe a high def recording to get the most of the details and sound.) The Video is of usual recordings of the times, and the sound is quite good. Overall production and video quality are good.
