7685229,4,B01COCKFOM,"I have heard Nina's music but did not know her story, so I enjoyed learning more about her.  I found the acting offered a moving portrayal and the music very enjoyable.  Zoe Soldana's renditions of Nina's music were powerful and have inspired me to seek out and listen to more of Nina's music to increase my personal appreciation of her gifts and talents.",1462060800,2,355,4.619047619047619
7685230,1,B01COCKFOM,"Awful! Zoe Saldana & David Oyelowo why did you involve yourselves with this project? Denzel played Malcolm X without makeup to lighten his complexion, no prosthetics -  it's called ""acting""! This movie disregards the genius, complexity, talent, contributions and experiences of Nina Simone.  I am baffled why the film's makers decided to ignore seven decades of this brilliant woman's life. This made the list ""Worst Movies I've Ever Seen"".",1461974400,8,440,5.36231884057971
7685231,4,B01COCKFOM,"We actually liked the movie and loved Zoe Saldana performance and singing (yes, and great singing!). Evidently, we were not comparing her to the real Nina, but watching as a poetic interpretarion of the truth, like Hollywood does all the time. Yes, Zoe is much younger than Nina was at that point in her life, and the make-up sucks. But try to watch it as a movie, not a biography.",1461801600,4,381,4.457142857142857
7685232,1,B01COCKFOM,"What a insensitive, tactless choice in actress.  I am NEVER spending my money on this movie.",1461715200,3,92,4.75
7685233,1,B01COCKFOM,Well that was a waste of 6.99. A movie that feels disorganized stringing together some interesting moments but mostly filled with out of order and inaccurate anecdotes about her life. Aside from the controversy of this movie I wanted to give it a chance to learn more about the genius that was/is will always be Nina Simone and finished feeling like I wasted my time.,1461715200,21,367,4.661538461538462
7685234,5,B01COCKFOM,LOVED IT!  And Zoe Saldana was exquisite in the role.  MASSIVE THUMBS UP!!,1461628800,2,74,4.615384615384615
7685235,1,B01COCKFOM,"Everything you wouldn't want to see in a film about Nina Simone. While Zoe Saldana might get a C+ for effort, one wonders if there were any mirrors anywhere on set or if she figured CGI would fix her appearance; although, the problems with this abysmal film are greater than Zoe's horrific makeup. The story is disjointed and focuses on absolutely arbitrary parts of Nina's life. There is no depth or realness to Cynthia Mort's vision of Nina and - considering the subject matter - that's an injustice.",1461628800,6,502,4.715909090909091
7685236,1,B01COCKFOM,"This was horrible. I've watched the Nina Simone documentary that was on Netflix to compare it to this movie. This was just awful. Choppy story line, no plot at all. Really bad makeup job. horrible accent, I don't know why she even had an accent. Zoe sang very well, but it was just a mess.",1461628800,12,289,4.2727272727272725
7685237,2,B01COCKFOM,"I'm so disappointed in this. Zoe can sing, but the choice to not use Nina's real voice takes away from the power of why the music mattered to so many Black Americans. Zoe's singing performance lacks the depth of Nina's powerful sound. Good enough to make a round of American Idol, but not for a movie.

The poorly designed make-up is distracting. If this were a stage play, then maybe the make-up and prosthetics could be given a pass, but since it is film it looks terrible. Bless them for trying, but no thank you. I'll wait for the next film to really give us a Nina to shout about. They tried to make it compelling (the supporting cast is great) but Zoe didn't make it work for me. Next time someone takes a swing at a Nina flick, give me something to root for.",1461369600,9,765,4.275862068965517
7685238,5,B01COCKFOM,"Loved it! Zoe does a very good job and she really gets into Nina's skin. And yes, Zoe can sing!!!
For me it's a really good thing that she dared to sing the songs herself, it makes everything more authentic given that it is not a documentary but a film biopic. Well acted, great music, I suggest you watch it before giving an opinion based on the unhelpful controversy that is been out there lately...!",1461369600,4,402,4.373333333333333

7685245,5,B01COCKFOM,"I love Nina Simone's music and this is a powerful and absorbing movie that is informative and entertaining. This movie is a profile of a great pianist and singer and how she reacted to the racism during the 1960's when she was coming of age. she was trained in classical piano and wanted to attend the Curtis Institute to advance her knowledge of classical music was denied that opportunity because she was black. she went on to create her own career while protesting racism. she became addicted to drugs and alcohol and struggled to define herself in a racist society. Nina Simone and James Baldwin shared a similar fate and both artists left this country for Europe where they struggled to find their identity, returning to this country to entertain their fans. Both Nina and Baldwin fought in the civil rights movement and were affected by the murder of Dr. King. This movie is a portrait of a black artist struggling to survive in a world torn by racism.

7685250,3,B01COCKFOM,"I understand why the surviving family of Nina Simone may have objected to this portrayal of the fabulously talented, but troubled Nia Simone. In all fairness to the the actress, I cannot think of a single actress or singer today who could portray Nina Simone. Nina Simone's voice was too distinctive for anyone to copy, and her piano playing was also too passionate for anyone other than a great pianist to imitate her style. The movie was unsatisfying in leaving out large gaps of Nina Simone's life. However, the actor David Oyelowo, did a wonderful job playing the supportive friend and eventual manager of Nina Simone, in spite of the ordeals he faced dealing with his friend's difficult behavior and mental illness.",1490140800,4,720,4.909836065573771

Nia Simone! (Zoe Saldana) truly unforgettable
I laughed, I cried and I was mesmerized. I find it hard to believe that this controversial Soulful Songstress of music was in so transparent and in so much pain... And now through the process of media if only for an hour and a half.  I get to peek and understand some of Ms. Simone's complexities through her transparent  life of a woman, wife, mother and a Soulful Songstress who was portrayed so heartbreakingly and underratedly by the equally beautiful and talented Ms. Zoe Saldana as she actually sang and performed the vocals in this vivid motion pictorial and unmistakably, she did Ms. Simone ever so intimately and tearfully proud. Not to mention the complexed and dangling of the love affair of Clifton Henderson portrayed by the infamous Mr. David Oyelowo. I truly am a better person for having to feel like I get to have this Soulful Songstress in my presence if only for an hour 1/2... OMG!!!! Not long enough",1489968000,,970,4.733727810650888

7685267,1,B01COCKFOM,"This is a deep fried, hot mess of a film. When the producers tested Zoe's make-up, they should have gone back to the drawing board right there. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one. What a waste of money and talent.

Why didn't they cast Brandy to play Nina Simone? Huh?",1483833600,10,272,4.132075471698113
7685268,3,B01COCKFOM,"For those, like me, who do not know a lot about Nina Simone, or her music, this film is a good incentive to dig deeper.  The movie includes an enticing selection of Simones music and encourages listening to more of her catalog. Many of the other reviews are quick to point out that Zoe Saldana does not resemble Nina; even so, Saldana gives a solid and consistent performance.  Her singing skills are great and I found her overall portrayal to be believable and sympathetic. With that said, its not a fast-paced movie and many scenes are subdued or drawn out to establish a mood. Much of the drama comes from Simones substance abuse and her attempt to tame her addictions so she can work again. A greater focus on the development of her music and the way she dealt with race related issues might have been more substantive and provided greater insight to her legacy. After watching this film, my take-away was to find out more about the real Nina Simone. This movie is not the place to stop listening.",1483228800,9,1001,4.555555555555555
7685269,1,B01COCKFOM,"Sadly not the best representation of the Nina I have listened to over the last 25 years.  Set aside the poorly written story line,  but the actors portrayal was angry and brash.  No back story.  I can't even say the acting was decent.  They were way off on this film.  The make up 'black face' was very off putting.  Singing doesn't sound remotely like Nina.  I couldn't finish it after waiting  so long to see it.. I do recommend the other documentaries out there on her.",1482710400,8,472,4.395348837209302

7685271,1,B01COCKFOM,"Somehow this filmed managed to disappoint me even as I had low expectations. The Director and Producers lack of sensitivity in casting and darkening the skin of an Actor was the tip of the iceberg for this film. Here is a strong artist, proud activist and revolutionary mind reduced to a supporting cast to a man. Why they chose this part of her life to highlight, from this perspective is troubling at best. Shameful film.",1482278400,,423,4.653333333333333

7685275,3,B01COCKFOM,"after seeing the documentary on it, which really captured her and her music much better, eh. not sure i agree with the criticism though, although I can see why zoe was a bad choice. nina was all about making a social and political statement and trying to get people to accept a wide range of looks, not just the madison avenue, as close to white features as possible view of beauty. nina didn't have that look, so making the case herself, as herself, had a punch which couldn't be captured by a more traditionally beautiful woman - zoe.",1479686400,3,536,4.479591836734694

7685277,1,B01COCKFOM,A disgrace to Nina Simone and her Legacy. Zoe Saldana was not able to do justice to the role of Nina Simone. She look like a pathetic clown in black face as she struggled through the songs of Nina Simone she has no voice she has no vocal Talent. This was quite simply an atrocity.,1479168000,6,280,4.109090909090909
7685278,4,B01COCKFOM,"Who knew Zoe Saldana could sing so well?  Not me.
Also, a well done movie,  an unflinching yet sympathetic view of the latter part of Nina Simone's life.  The actor in the Richard Pryor part was fantastic..",1479081600,3,206,4.513513513513513

7685282,2,B01COCKFOM,"If ever there was a movie doomed to failure, this is it.  Not because of the subject matter.  By all accounts musician Nina Simone was an interesting and provocative entertainer.  First time director, Cynthia Mort, working from her own script, selects Zoe Saldana to play Simone after Mary J. Blige opted out.  If you are familiar with Saldana and Simone, you will know that they don't look anything like each other.  So heavy makeup and skin darkening was used to make Saldanas appearance more fathomable.  Critics went bonkers as I recall.

While Im no expert on Simones background, I just have a hard time believing that she was just the person being portrayed here.  If you are familiar with the recent Miles Davis biopic, Miles, much of this aspect of Simones life seems to mirror her male contemporary, including the gun slinging.  The film focuses on a period in Simones life where she was battling everyone around her.  Her managers, her record producers, and anyone who got in her way.  She was an alcoholic, drug user and bipolar.  She was also extremely talented.

The film opens when she is a young girl set to perform a Bach concerto before a largely white audience.  She refuses until her parents are allowed to sit up front.  After a year in Julliard, she was denied admission to a prominent New England school.  So the stage is set.  Years later after a violent argument with a record executive, Simone is hospitalized.  There she meets a nurse by the name of Clifton Henderson (David Oyelowo) who she hires to be her personal assistant.  Much of the film details her time in France, where she lived most of the time.  She had become fed up with America and their treatment of minorities.  She was especially outraged when Martin Luther King was killed.  Her relationship with Henderson is never really explained.  The assumption is that he was gay and I assume Nina knew that.  But why did he stay with her?

Saldanas portrayal is commendable.  She handles all of her own singing and she has an excellent voice.  It is even in the same range as Simone but far removed from her gravelly, smoky tones.  The biggest problem with the film is that it never really shows another side of Simone.  Surely there is a softer side, gone unexplored here.  The story meanders all over the place as well.  We get flashback scenes but I was never sure what the point was.  Simones friendship with Richard Pryor is limited to one brief scene over a phone call.  Did Simone ever reconcile with her daughter?  How are songs selected for her performances?

Perhaps this isn't all Morts fault.  As I understand it, the film was taken away from her after shooting stopped.  So all of the post-production work was done without her supervision.  The movie was shot in 2012 and was shelved until 2016.  It should have stayed on the shelf.",1478476800,,2831,4.665314401622718

7685329,2,B01COCKFOM,"Before a single frame was shot of Cynthia Mort's Nina Simone biopic, the simply-titled ""Nina"", the claws were already out for it due to the controversial casting of Zoe Saldana. The ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star is a very good actress, that much was never in dispute, but did she have the presence to capture the volatile singer and civil rights activist? Nobody expected her to match Simone's unique singing voice, but can she capture the complicated racial identity that was at the heart of the singer's most terrible pain? It turns out that Saldana's performance isn't really the problem, but the confounding and often shoddy details around her that drive the film down the charts.

Penned by Mort, the film centers on the least active time in Simone's life, the final years after she had largely been out of the spotlight. The confusion, anger, and paranoia that were so much a core of her being at the height of her career have been amplified, leading to her being thrown into a mental institution after attacking a record exec over ""stolen"" royalties. There she meets the man who would become her constant companion, Clifton (David Oyelowo), a nurse and the only one there who treats her with the respect she feels she deserves.

For Nina is a handful; a fearsome hellcat with a magical singing voice only matched by her talent on the piano. After helping Nina check out of the hospital, Clifton reluctantly accepts her offer to be her assistant, jet-setting to France immediately. ""France is better!"", she shouts at him to seal the deal, praising the luxurious city that had become her home since she lost faith in America. But Clifton soon begins to realize why Nina has a reputation that makes nobody want to work with her. The mercurial star drinks champagne like it was water, blows up over the slightest protestation, trembles in the sunlight, and basically treats Clifton like garbage. He doesn't tolerate it for long, leaving her to head back home to Chicago, only to have the remorseful Nina arrive shortly thereafter to win him back with an offer to be her manager.

But the central problem still exists: nobody wants to work with Nina Simone. She's too much of a risk. At one gig she slashes a guy's arm because he was talking too loud. With the money running out, Clifton is forced to try and turn Nina's life around if he ever wants to see her back on top. There's a lifetime of hurt and anger she has to get over, including her broken relationship with her estranged daughter who we see only in flashback. We also get brief glimpses into her time as the voice of the civil rights movement, and how the death of Martin Luther King impacted her feelings about America. In one of the film's best scenes, a phone conversation with an MS-afflicted Richard Pryor (Mike Epps) triggers a memory of their earliest encounter, before the fame and the drugs and everything had damaged them.

Unfortunately, Mort's screenplay never clues us in to why these moments are important to Nina. It's as if Mort feels a need to hit upon them just to mark them off the checklist, but she never puts them in any proper context. Worse, we never truly learn what inspired Nina's soul-wrenching lyrics; never really get a sense of the isolation she was feeling. Saldana never had a chance of being able to match Nina's silky voice, but she takes to performing a few of her most notable tracks to varying degrees of success. ""I Put a Spell on You"" is a particular favorite as it's heard a few times, perhaps because of issues with gaining the rights to all of Nina's recordings.

But the biggest issue is Saldana's shoe polish appearance, which is sure to inflame those already dubious of her casting. Simone had faced hated and prejudice over her physical features, especially over her dark skin, that having Saldana portray her in such an artificial way seems like a slap in the face. To her credit, Saldana does her best to pay the proper respect to Nina Simone, and she plays the role as well as someone in her unfortunate position could. It's a wonder how much of the blame for ""Nina"" being such a disappointment falls upon the shoulders of Mort, who has been claiming for a couple of years that the studio took the decision-making out of her hands. Perhaps we'll never know, just as we may never know everything about who Nina Simone was, because the answers certainly aren't found in ""Nina"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nina/dp/B01CQ3PR4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nina</a>",1463788800,8,4522,4.822164948453608
7685330,5,B01COCKFOM,Zoe Saldana deserves best actress of the the year award for her performance in this movie. Loved it!!!,1463788800,,102,4.722222222222222
7685331,4,B01COCKFOM,"I guess it was fortunate that I had not heard of whatever ""controversy"" surrounded this film prior to its release, so I did not take on any kind of juvenile fan-worship expectations that might make me hate the film before ever seeing it. I thought Zoe Saldana did a fine job with Nina Simone's affect and demeanor. She and also did a fine job with the vocals. Critics that say she looks nothing like Nina are also missing the real quality of Saldana's performance, as she captured the essence of Nina Simone, particularly her facial affect, which a less sophisticated viewing audience can not appreciate as they seem to have been looking for a Nina Simone impersonator rather than an actress who has studied the character to the degree that Saldana clearly has. In a Kardashian world, we may have dumbed viewing audiences down to the degree that they cannot appreciate anything if they are not hit over the head with obviousness, that is, when they are not screeching with mindless political correctness.

That said, the makeup could have been better, or less obtrusive. But I enjoyed the movie, which was obviously only a vignette of the later years of Ms. Simone's troubled life and not a full-scale towering homage intended to completely capture the entirety of the inimitably iconic figure. A mature audience that can recognize this will have a better chance of enjoying this film for what it is, an entertaining movie and a solid performance by Zoe Saldana.",1463702400,6,1462,4.824701195219124

7685333,3,B01COCKFOM,"This is a biography of Nina Simone, alcoholic, drug user and occasional singer by this biopic. The film opens in 1946 at age 13 she gives a recital. Her name was not Nina (Zoe Saldana) at that time. She had changed it so her family would not be embarrassed by her profession. The film picks up later after she tries to shoot a man in 1985, not 1995 as the film wrongly states. It moves forward with her struggle with alcohol and relationship with Clifton (David Oyelowo) with minor flashbacks.

The acting was great, unfortunately the editing and script left much to be desired. It concentrated too much on her demons and little to nothing on her music. One would argue that was in intent, but they missed an opportunity to make a truly entertaining film.

7685335,4,B01COCKFOM,"This is not a documentary of Nina Simone (who's talent, politics, and struggle with mental illness and addiction I respect and even appreciate). I think if you come at this from the point of view that this is NOT a documentary and that not every biopic about a real-life person is cast with a body double then you can find room to suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy this movie.  Who knew Zoe Saldana had such a voice? I thought for sure it was dubbed by someone else, it wasn't. Did she sound exactly like Nina Simone? No, few could. But she had the attitude down.",1462492800,5,573,4.355140186915888
7685336,1,B01COCKFOM,This movie is badly produced. The actors should have run for the hills when offered the roles.  I only rated one star because I could not rate zero stars. Can I have my $6.99 returned time or a credit.,1462060800,6,201,4.153846153846154
7685337,3,B01COCKFOM,"Nina is a work of fiction.  The Clifton character has been publicly discredited by reliable sources of Nina Simone's.  Therefore, Nina cannot be considered a biopic by any stretch of the imagination.

If one approaches the film knowing from the outset it has no grounds in reality, then one can sit back and enjoy it for what it is: a movie about an incredibly talented black woman with mental issues who drinks too much, has an explosive temper and no money.

At no point does the viewer feel they are learning about or watching the real Nina Simone unless one is completely devoid of knowledge of her legacy.  Zoe does a credible job portraying the woman described above, but never delves deep enough into character to give even the slightest glimpse of who the real Nina was or why we should relate to her or care about her.
The ""blackened face"" and fake nose were all for naught as the film did not even touch on the discrimination Nina experienced because of her color other than to comment on squashed childhood dreams and the awkward opening scene involving her parents.  These scenes do nothing to reveal the anguish Nina must have endured, not merely as a black artist, but as a VERY DARK SKINNED black artist.

David Oyelowo, as Clifton, was great at scowling and looking worried, but not much else.  The script did not allow for much else, even for this capable actor.

I'm not going to hate on this film because others feel Zoe's complexion was too light for her to be considered for the role of Nina Simone.  Like I mentioned before, this is a work of fiction, so a white woman could have been cast and it still would have had no real impact on the legacy of Nina Simone.

Despite it's name, this movie is NOT about Nina Simone.  That story has yet to be told.  As such, naysayers can actually breathe a sigh of relief.",1462060800,18,1832,4.498489425981873

I personally will not spend any money to support this film. Just my personal thoughts on this...

8753561,4,B01COCKFOM,I think Zoe Zaldano did an excellent acting and singing job. I am an avid Nina fan for decades. So much negative controversy before this movie ever aired.  If you want a definitive autobiography of Nina you need to check out her daughters documentary on Netflix. I've seen Nina perform live and in reality no one could ever imitate her unique voice. I wish they'd used her music in their movie.  Consequently no one could successfully imitate her regardless of looks.

8753562,2,B01COCKFOM,"Nina Simone is like a goddess to me.  I was really sad to see her portrayed as such a strung-out bitch.  Her greatest disappointment in life was that she was denied a career as a concert pianist.  She was abused by her predatory, exploitative husband, and used by an industry that chewed up and spit out talent. No wonder she was difficult! I would have preferred to see a movie about her career, her interactions with other performers, the creation of her music and her contributions to the civil rights movement.  To me, this was just another exploitation film, playing on the gossip about her worst qualities.  I hope someone makes a truly salutatory epic about such a great performer.",1522540800,,688,4.7

Getting a mixed girl doesn't make it look any less ignorant.",1522195200,,407,4.368421052631579
8753564,1,B01COCKFOM,"If I could've given this movie a ZERO, I would have. For true Nina fans this movie is insulting! I decided to watch because I like to give people a chance before any judgement. I was ready to give up at 16 minutes, but soldiered through, and only made it to 27 minutes. It seems to me that no one made an earnest effort to learn Nina's story. There was so much content that was not factual. As a matter of fact it was the opposite. I don't know too much about Zoe Saldana's career as an actress, but she was in over her head taking on this characterization, in my opinion. What is disturbing is that some will look at this and think this is the story of Nina, when her story like the woman herself is so much more complex and intricate. To portray her, one would have to immerse themselves in her story, and basically eat, drink, and sleep Nina. No one seemed to care enough to do research and present facts, it appears they only wanted to portray the salacious stories of her life like a reality show. Nina Simone deserves more, and it is my hope that one day someone will give this important voice in American music the platform that is due.",1516665600,,1143,4.247706422018348
8753565,3,B01COCKFOM,"I gave it 3 stars just based off the subject matter alone.. I think all the backlash about Zoe Saldana playing the lead role and the fact that it was a low low budget film (only $7 million), left unreal expectations. But it wasn't all that bad after all, considering what it was. A low budget indie film. The role of Nina Simone had originally gone to Mary J Blige but she was pulled after making this comment to Rolling Stone Magazine:

""[Playing] a character like Nina Simone is playing myself, because Nina Simone was a manic depressive, drug addict, alcoholic, cursing wild maniac that I was, but very talented, so people would get that.

Would MJB have done the role any better justice?",1516147200,,691,4.564516129032258
