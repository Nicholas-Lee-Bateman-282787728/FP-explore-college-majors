8390317,5,B003767CUU,"This is the third volume of Queen Seondeok, a really long K-drama. Volume 1 is the background, Volume 2 is the ascent of the hidden heir and building power to ascend  the throne. In this volume, everything really starts to fall apart. Keeping control and staying true to one's ideals is very difficult. Old friends and companions end up in power and isolation, plotting against each other and making compromises that destroy their relationships. It all ends in an inevitable tragedy of blood and betrayal. Each character's original strengths, such as love, loyalty, persistence, devotion to duty, trust, etc. prove to be their weakness in the end. Lots of sad moments in this Volume. Every time it looks like something may be salvaged, fate intervenes. Minor characters assume pivotal roles as betrayal follows betrayal and  characters manipulate and are manipulated further down the road to destruction.",1360972800,,904,5.184931506849315
8390318,5,B003767CUU,"I enjoyed this. You can really cheer for that main character. It is interesting watching the character figure out things and work through problems. If you watch the first 20 episodes, you'll want to watch it all.",1332028800,,212,4.756756756756757

8390320,3,B003767CUU,"I have ordered Korean Period Piece Drama series from Amazon before and the products arrive timely and most often in good condition.  The Queen Seondeok series however, has had flaws in the DVDs in places making viewing for a couple of episodes rather uncomfortable and requiring intervention to fast forward.  It makes ordering series a concern because a problem affects the volume since you cannot easily replace a bad DVD disc, at least not in a way that I know of.",1276732800,,467,4.753086419753086
8390321,5,B003767CUU,"Story line is good and I believe that if you don't know korean at all, you can follow the english subtitles unlike some of the dramas.",1271462400,,134,4.1923076923076925
8390322,5,B003767CUU,"You will be easily hooked to this compelling and riveting story. It is by far the best production I have ever viewed. The actors, screenplay, and music are absolutely superb. I have recommended this saga to everyone I know. Be sure to purchase Vol I and II to really appreciate the story. This is a must-see. American movies pale in comparison. Hollywood should take notes from this one.",1270425600,,387,4.705882352941177
8390323,5,B003767CUU,"For the best audio and video quality with the original broadcast English subtitles, look for 'Studio: MBC America' under Product Details. MBC America is the licensed US distributor for The Great Queen Seondeok. MBC America works from the original MBC-TV master recordings and hires professional translators for the broadcast subtitles, which are also used for the DVD release. Each episode runs about 60 minutes. Volume 1 contains Episodes 1-20; Volume 2 contains Episodes 21-43; Volume 3, Episodes 44-62. On a personal note, I've subtitled many Korean programs but Queen Seondeok is my favorite historical drama. Fans of romance, action and intrigue will not be disappointed.
