7832143,5,6302822807,"The video on this page is the authentic special of the Berenstain Bears' Easter Suprise, an animated holiday special. Be sure to get the copy of the video that says Embassy Entertainment, it may be listed separately as the tape still works well after many years. The copy of the video on this page is by the cheaper Good Times entertainment and the quality of the tape is poor with tracking isses.
The story itself is very entertaining with high quality animation. Boss Bunny is in charge of Spring, and is frustrated enough to quit. Poppa Bear decides to build an Easter egg machine with disastrous results. Lots of neat Easter surprises in this fun tape.",1266969600,2,656,4.663793103448276
7832144,5,6302822807,"It's a mystery to me WHY great lesson-learning/moralistic children's stories such as the Berenstain Bears are SOOOO limited on DVD!  My girls loved all the stories and now that I'm about to become a grandmother for the first time, I can't find any of the holiday stories on DVD!  We need so many more wholesome, ageless cartoons such as Berenstain Bears!",1110067200,3,354,4.786885245901639
