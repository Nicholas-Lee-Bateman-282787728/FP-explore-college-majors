8111423,3,B000EMNDCG,"This DVD provides a good coverage of the operation of the rife as well as how to assemble and disassemble the rifle.  However, it does not provide instructions on how to build the rifle. If your want to better understand the rifle, its component, operation, and history, this is the video for you.  If you are looking for a guide to build a HK 91 rifle this is not what you are looking for, but the knowledge provided in this video will certainly help you with your project. I would have given four stars, but the video honestly isn't worth $40.  If it were sold around $20 I would have given four stars.",1456444800,,604,4.327433628318584
8111424,2,B000EMNDCG,"Unfortunately this video does not cover work beyond simple field stripping and cleaning - not an armorer's course in the least. No mention at all relating to checking / adjusting headspace dimensions, or anything to do with the critical aspects of working with different roller sizes to properly set up the roller-blowback guns. Additionally, there is no mention of the important differences / parts compatibility between the HK & CETME versions. To top it off, very poor production quality, often so blurry that important details are obscured.",1365120000,5,544,5.264367816091954
8111425,4,B000EMNDCG,"Building your own rifle is a very satisfying hobby to have, and I have been doing it for a few years, and thought I would give one of the legendary HK rifles a try.  I thought this would be a good DVD to watch, if nothing else to learn how the rifle works.  In this respect, the DVD is great.  It goes into detail on how the HK roller locking system works.  The course is also geared to showing how to properly assemble and disassemble the HK G3 rifle.  There is lots of history on the rifle explained in detail.

If you are building a rifle from a flat receiver, you really need to get the AGI video Building The Semi Auto G-3 (HK-91).  This video goes into more detail on how to truly build one yourself.

My recommendation would be to get both courses, this way you will have most all the information you need to build one of these fine military rifles.  Also, make sure that you check out some of the online resources such as weapons guild dot com.

Good luck and have some fun.",1339372800,5,982,4.175531914893617
