It's the backyard wrestling of the film industry. I think it takes someone who has put in effort to work in film before to truly appreciate what has been made here. I'm a dirty person, and I appreciate this film start to finish.

RIP Best Boy",1521072000,,385,4.347222222222222
8472199,5,B005GR1G9G,"This movie was pretty funny. I did enjoy the ""casual"" laid-back banter of the characters. There were definitely some points in the movie where i did laugh out loud. I was looking for something to watch that would be light and entertaining, and i found it in this movie. Alone or with friends, if you like silly parody type movies, then look no further, It's all in good fun.",1505520000,,374,4.434782608695652

8472201,5,B005GR1G9G,"I am a huge fan of Independent films, and this one is by far... at the top of my list.
It's not only very creative but also more importantly... original.

The best part is when I have friends over and they get to watch it for their time, my house is full of laughter.

This movie should come with a warning: ""Don't attempt to eat food or drink liquids while watching this film, cause it will be sprayed across the room from laughing so hard"".

I look forward to more films from Mr. Dewandeler.",1322697600,,493,4.223404255319149
8472202,1,B005GR1G9G,"The acting, production value, and entire movie is just awful. Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I've never written a review for a movie on Amazon before, but because of just how terrible this movie was I felt I had to say something to warn others. Even if it's a parody movie making fun of other parodies it's still just awful. There isn't a single redeemable quality.",1317600000,5,376,4.544117647058823
8472203,5,B005GR1G9G,"We all know Animal House and other college cult classics...I think this could be the next such item!
Sharing a few beers, or after some tailgating, hey, let's watch that Parody Movie again, it's a riot!",1314057600,,202,4.638888888888889
8472204,5,B005GR1G9G,"I've been so sick of the horrible parodies, but when I'd seen this independent film, I figured it wouldn't get stuck in the usual Hollywood typecasting.  I was right, it was awesome and original....Some graphics were a bit cheesy, but that fit perfectly into the premise.  I recommend this to everyone!!!!!!",1313020800,,307,5.0
8472205,5,B005GR1G9G,"I had the pleasure of seeing ""Parody Movie"" at a screening held in the Detroit area last year, and I was amazed at what I saw.  First time feature film writer/director Charles Dewandeler showcases an unbelievably unique talent...he's a rising star that surely has a bright future in movies.  Parody Movie is silly-funny, with some laugh out loud moments throughout.  The best part of it for me was the pacing of the film...you are quite literally laughing from beginning to end, all the while wondering how somebody on such a limited budget could possibly produce something this uniquely creative.

I recommend everybody buy this film to support not only a local Michigan-area filmmaker, but to get a peek at a true talent doing what he does best...if you have never heard of Charles Dewandeler, you will soon!",1313020800,5,810,4.890510948905109
