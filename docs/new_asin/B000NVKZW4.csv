2786705,5,B000NVKZW4,"I absolutely love this video. I've been practicing with it almost everyday since I got it. Maya has this beautiful voice and the music is awesome. This CD starts with a warm-up set that I just do on it's own when I don't have much time. Then, it has a set for kidneys and adrenals. I know one of the negative comments was that it's missing a meditation, but I don't feel that it's a big deal since one of the exercises in the set includes a meditation. All the exercises are easy to follow and make me feel great. I usually feel energized and relaxed every time I practice. I shared it with my friends and everyone loved it. Maya does a very good job explaining the benefits of all the exercises.
I also own every Ana and Ravi CD.  I love them and I never thought I would find something to compare to the sets they do, but Maya certainly did a great job with this set. I think if you're a beginner, her set is certainly easier to follow and she adheres more to Kundalini wisdom like doing the root locks. I think it makes a big difference to include breathing exercises and root locks.",1189987200,47,1085,4.216346153846154
2786706,5,B000NVKZW4,I have other Kundalini DVD's but Maya's is the best. The time goes so quickly and she says many beautiful things that lift you up. Maya is my new guru.,1186185600,6,151,4.066666666666666
2786707,4,B000NVKZW4,"I've tried 2 of Ravi Singh & Ana Brett's dvds so far & love them. I also love & have almost all of Gurutej Kaur & Gurmakh's.
I felt good energy from this one, parts of my body vibrated, I had sweat, & after dong one exercise, I suddenly felt my muscles in my body release & I was immediately much more flexible. I was dizzy & feeling weird for 15 min after that while I detoxed & my body opened up the energy, but felt great even before that.
She gives great history info about how kundalini & came to the US, and during each exercise, she encourages you to keep going, what each exercise works on & how it benefits your health & spirit. She gives more info about how Kundalini works then Ravi & Ana do.
She actually executes the movements more slowly then Ravi & Ana do. She did a different breathe called ""cannon?"" (she has a bit of an accent) that felt great that haven't seen on any other dvd yet.

2786708,1,B000NVKZW4,"Maya Fiennes has really done it now. This is the single worst Yoga DVD ever to come out of Britain. The music is so irritating that my Capuchin monkey Cletus actually gets upset and cries when I put it in the DVD player.

I feel like I'd rather be in a horrific car accident and have some sort of cranial injury than do Yoga with Name Dropping Opportunist Maya Fiennes. Oh yeah, she claims to have taught Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes and made them into Yoga experts. Freakin' name dropper.
As far as I can tell, the only thing this Yoga DVD is good for is pissing me off.",1184198400,16,575,4.2272727272727275
2786709,3,B000NVKZW4,"I have been doing Kundalini yoga for about 5 years now and I am always on the lookout for new dvd's. I own everything by Ravi Singh.  I already have this yoga set on another dvd which is more complete than Maya Fiennes'  The only thing I do like about her dvd is the music.  The other reviewer said that the chants were African. No they are gurmukhi mantra chants. The music is tribal. That said here is what you can expect.

Setting:  Totally white.  Teacher is dressed in white on a sheepskin rug.
Music: tribal with vocals.  I really liked the music
Instruction: In voice over. She tells you a lot about kundalini yoga during the poses.
Kriya:  This is the set for the adrenals.  It consists of hands in lotus and moving them out to the side; wrist press; body drops, active cat/cow; pelvis lifts holding ankles and a couple of other poses.
The class ends with deep relaxation.
What I didn't like:  No meditation at the end of the class.  I think teachers do a dis-service to students when they only teach the physical part of kundalini yoga. I'm a traditionalist in that respect; to me kundalini yoga is much much more than stretching. Without the meditation, you might as well do pilates! There are 1000's of meditations to choose from and she couldn't include one of them on this dvd.  That is what I love about Ravi Singh's dvds, he includes meditations on EVERY SINGLE DVD he puts out.

If you are interested in this set on dvd.  Get the dvd by Sat Jivan Singh Khalsa at the spiritvoyage website.  It includes 4 meditations and a delightful GONG relaxation. You haven't lived until you've relaxed to the sound of the GONG.
I rented this dvd from netflix and after previewing it I sent it right back.

Overall:  If you are new to kundalini yoga, you may like this.  Old timers may be a bit bored.  But she has good energy and is nice to watch.",1182816000,118,1850,4.404129793510324
2786710,5,B000NVKZW4,You may think all you're going to get are some slow movements and deep breathing exercises.  Think again!  Along with wonderful African sounding beats and chants are some very lively movements.  This is just under an hour (you can skip the introduction the second time) and I look forward to the two days a week I've worked it into my schedule.  Truly gives me a good feeling for the day.,1182038400,28,388,4.5
2786731,5,B000NVKZW4,"I love Kundalini Yoga. It is a yoga that keeps you moving for meditation. Maya is easy to listen to, unlike many of the yoga instructors who spend too much time telling you to feel good about yourself. The only complaint is that when you keep doing this video, there are a couple of instructions that are basically for first time use.",1464566400,,334,4.403225806451613

2786756,5,B000NVKZW4,"I love this video! I have the DVD which ice been doing for over 5 years. The music, instruction and the fact that Maya tells you what each move does, how it affects your body, glands, etc. is very informative and a beautiful learning experience. I take my DVD on vacation - but now all I need is my iPad, since purchasing it in this format! I have given the DVD as gifts to many friends and still continue to do so!",1436918400,2,415,4.073170731707317

2786773,5,B000NVKZW4,"Good yoga without having to feel like a pretzel.  No complicated exercises to memorize, and easy to do as part of a morning routine before going to work.  The ""detox"" exercises really work, and even if you only do the first 30 min (vs. the whole hour) it's still beneficial.",1428278400,2,274,4.46

2786776,4,B000NVKZW4,"Maya leads a clear yoga class and I really like that there are no distractions in the back ground. The reason I did not give the 5 stars, there is not enough time to adjust to positions and the voice over during the meditation portions. Otherwise a great, simple yoga DVD",1423353600,,271,4.333333333333333

I ordered some KY dvds on amazon and since i tried ""KY to detox and destress"" i have been practicing almost everyday (and this is a real miracle : normally i abandon new activities after a couple of weeks because of inconstance). She made me love Kundalini Yoga, now my day don't start without it .Slowly I built up some strenght and after about 40 days i switched to Mays's Yoga for Real Life, I practiced that for 40 days about and switched to Maya's ""A Journey through the Chakras"" and i work  one chackra at a time. I don't know if this is the right sequence but for me it has been perfect. I am doing this since a couple of months and i will go on. So i am practicing KY with Maya fiennes'dvds now and my health has improved greatly, I m in a much better shape and i am more happy...normally i don't write much reviews but i am really greatful to Maya!",1418774400,6,976,4.05699481865285

2786788,5,B000NVKZW4,"I didn't know what to expect from this, I do yoga but wasn't familiar with Kundalani yoga. It was really different and fun. More into the spiritual aspects than I'm used to, but I liked that too. Probably good for those with a lot of nervous energy or anxiety to release. It involves some chanting and busy repetitive movements that induce a trance like feeling as opposed to slow stretching and holding of hatha style. I felt like some kind of mental adjustment happened during the process and I want to explore it further so I bought her full season 1 as well.",1412294400,3,562,4.466019417475728

2786801,5,B000NVKZW4,This is really an amazing video - I have many of Maya's DVD's and what she does makes a huge difference in your life - in so many areas.

2786802,5,B000NVKZW4,"Love this DVD! Love Maya. This is truly a wonderful way to detox and de-stress. It's not your ""typical"" yoga. Kundalini approaches yoga from a totally different place than most. It is refreshing and it works.",1408924800,,208,4.805555555555555
2786803,5,B000NVKZW4,One of my favorite yoga routines of all times. I had a DVD of this routine that I got from the store and loved it so much that it had scratches on it to the point where it didn't work anymore. I was so disappointed. This routine is so relaxing. Maya Fiennes does such a wonderful job in detoxing the body and helping to relieve stress. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to relax and relieve stress.,1408665600,,403,4.17948717948718

2786805,5,B000NVKZW4,"I love this DVD!  It covers a lot of different techniques for practicing Kundalini Yoga, and is easy to follow along.  It's very relaxing, the music (by Maya Fiennes) is wonderful, and it's like having Maya Fiennes in my living room whenever I play it.  I really like her style and her peaceful manner.  I always feel grounded and energized afterwards.  It's not a hardcore workout, but it has other health benefits.  I know that it is doing wonders for balancing the internal workings of my body and soul, helps my breathing, and decreases stress in a multitude of ways.",1407801600,3,571,4.66

2786808,5,B000NVKZW4,"I ordered this because I have scoliosis and as I get older it worsens.  Stress also really causes back pain for me.  This and some of her others, especially Kundalini Courage and Creativity have given me more pain free days than I have enjoyed in a very long time.
They have become my most regularly used fitness/yoga dvds.  I cannot say enough good about them.  They are also the kind of exercise that I can do at night and go to bed relaxed and refreshed, without pain, wake without pain, but still I am able to feel that I have work core muscles and legs and arms.  Love them.",1404086400,2,579,4.275229357798165
2786809,1,B000NVKZW4,"I never tried Kundalini yoga before. I have been doing other types of yoga for about three years now. Anyway a yogi friend of mine let me borrow this and honestly I just thought it was awful. There were no flows, no sun salutations or wind salutation. No flows at all. It seemed like the whole video was hyperventilating and chanting. I have nothing against chanting we do it in my yoga class all the time, but this is all this DVD does is chant and breathe. It's also so slow, even for beginners! If this was my introduction to yoga I probably wouldn't have ever done it again. If you want some good beginner yoga DVDs I recommend Desi Barlett's ""Yoga for Beginners"" and pretty much anything by Hemalaya. I love all her DVDS but especially Yoga for Urban LIving (If you're intermediate) and her Dosha yoga video. I did really like Maya Fiennes though she  had a calm voice and makes you feel relaxed. But other than that I really hated this DVD.",1402963200,2,946,4.405714285714286

2786813,5,B000NVKZW4,"For those of us over 50, this video is a must-have. Stretching is essential in keeping our bodies healthy and youthful. I always steered clear of Yoga because some of the poses seemed impossible especially since I have vertigo, at times. Maya does a great job of offering gentle stretching at a variety of levels (I am a beginner). I have only been doing the stretching 3 weeks and already I see a difference in my flexibility. Yoga is a great workout!",1392940800,3,452,4.524390243902439
2786814,5,B000NVKZW4,"I was first introduced to Kundalini Yogi through music.  After watching a few Sat Nam music videos my interest was peeked and I wanted to learn more about Kundalini yoga. (and what ""these"" people had that was so calm and beautiful!)  In the beginning of my search I admittedly was a bit overwhelmed!  The teachings seemed ancient and secret: I didn't understand a lot of the chants, mudras,etc.  I was almost set to bail on my research when I ran into a version of Maya's class on youtube. Her easy to understand, thoughtful explanations and ease into which she starts had both my husband and I hooked!  We decided to buy the entire full version and now use it to begin our official (40 day) venture into the world of yoga.

I LOVE this ""detox & destress"" DVD. Maya is incredibly supportive, gentle  and explains every single move, chant and the reasons behind it.  The music is WONDERFUL...fun..uplifting with beautiful spirit. (In fact, we loved the music so much...we went on to order her music dvd!)  I would consider this a great DVD for anyone starting out into Kundalini, as well as a great set of Kriyas for the advanced.
I now consider Maya my own personal ""virtual teacher"" and use this particular DVD every single morning to get my day grounded and centered.  (whenever I am stressed at work I can hear Maya's voice saying ""let the body settle"" in her cute accent )
I can't wait to order more from her!",1392681600,7,1413,4.549407114624506
2786815,5,B000NVKZW4,"Remember folks this is kundalini, not hatha. Some reviews talk negatively because of the white or they way the kriyas are done. Again this is kundalini. I would say an absolute beginner could do this. There maybe some wording as a beginner you don't understand but it won't deter you for getting through. When my mood drops and I feel depressed, deeply, I pull this out and 40 minutes later I feel lighter, more clear headed and joy hence the destress in the title. Yes this says for detox and destress but I think this is an easy, go to, not too long or complicated practice. I think it is quite fun. When I get on a consistent practice of kundalini, Especially with this DVD I find that in my daily life I tend to finish things and don't quit them or give up. Interesting. Oh and Maya Fiennes, I adore her and have other DVDs of her.",1392681600,4,835,4.291139240506329

2786817,5,B000NVKZW4,This is a good video for an introduction to Kundalini Yoga.  The warm up that starts the workout is particularly good for opening up and relaxing your back and shoulders.,1390867200,3,170,4.666666666666667
2786818,5,B000NVKZW4,"Maya is easy to listen to as she describes what each movement does and the impact it can have.  I have always struggled with enjoying traditional yoga, however not with kundalini I love every minute of this beautiful meditative yoga.",1390435200,2,233,4.825
2786819,5,B000NVKZW4,"I consider this video to be the best kind of medicine I've ever taken. What surprised me most is that, aside from the immediate gratification this practice gives me (making me want to continue doing it), there have been some very pronounced psychological changes occurring in me since I began. I am far less anxious at the end of the day, I am more confident when communicating with people, and I am drinking half as much coffee as I used to.

I highly recommend this to virtually everyone.",1390176000,11,490,4.568181818181818
2786820,5,B000NVKZW4,"A dear friend has been nagging me about Kundalini Yoga and the great benefits thereof for quite some time now and I finally succumbed and bought this DVD.  Just wish I'd bought it sooner!  VERY powerful workout.  Started off thinking ho-hum, this isn't going to work and it's surely going to bore me very quickly.  Hah!  How wrong I was.  I'm doing this every second day.  In just over three weeks, I've lost weight, feel lighter, brighter and sharper and am experiencing subtle, but profound shifts in many areas of my life.  I can't recommend this enough!  And the music is fabulous!! People have been inclined to moan about the white on white thing and I can't for the life of me figure out what they mean.  Maya's gorgeously tanned body shows up beautifully against the white and makes it super easy to following her movements.  Buy it, use it, change your life.",1387584000,6,866,4.594771241830065
2786831,5,B000NVKZW4,Awesome Yoga Routine. If you have any back issues/aches/tightness/discomfort at all this is the Yoga for you. You get into it and you absolutely will pause the video so you can continue doing a certain Kria/Cria(?) for a longer period because it feels so good. We were meant to move our bodies like this.

2786835,5,B000NVKZW4,Kundalini Yoga is new to me but it is a great pm yoga for me. Very relaxing and also a good core workout. Unlike the yoga I have done this tape does 30 repetitions of several of the moves and 'breath of fire'(kind of a rhythmic panting.

2786857,5,B000NVKZW4,I have done different types of Yoga over the years and just recently was introduced to Kundalini. The first video I tried (with a different instructor than Maya) was not what I was expecting and didn't like it at all. Then I decided to give in one more go with Maya and this video. I have totally found exactly what I was looking for. It has a deep spiritual depth to it and I felt connected right away. The pace is perfect and I felt cleansed and purified when I completed this session. LOVE IT!! I feel the Yoga sequence she has picked is well balanced and comes together nicely.

2786859,5,B000NVKZW4,"By far my favorite introduction to Kundalini yoga. Attracted to the chakra element, I had first tried two other Kundalini yoga dvds- One was too ""rock star/glam"" & the other was just too weird & cult-like. This one was ""just right."" Hit that sweet spot of gentle, steely, uplifting guru without a lot of distractions.

I've ordered it again for not just one, but two dear friends as a gift. A calm yet energizing set that feels like a healing session no matter how many times I view & practice it. Living in a rural area, there aren't too many yoga teachers out of any tradition to learn directly from. I've wondered what ""school"" is right for me & am convinced this one fits me.

Only improvement would be more form tips, what muscles you should be reaching with or what the inner orientation should be, what part of your anatomy should you be pressing down on at times. And I find some of the clockwise/counterclockwise sequences are not balanced so you may have to pause & add some revolutions in one direction or the other. On the whole my #1 favorite go-to yoga dvd. I like if not love everything Maya does- My only wish is for perhaps more sessions included on a disc & less one by by one by entire lone dvds. Enjoy.",1372636800,2,1222,4.402654867256637
2786860,5,B000NVKZW4,I use this tape three days a week and it has turned my life around.  I was depressed over a major loss in my life and doing this tape has taught me how to meditate my way back to good mental health.  I highly recommend this tape to people who need a little motivation and deep breathing in their lives.,1372550400,4,302,4.016666666666667
2786861,2,B000NVKZW4,"I wanted to like this DVD and there is a lot of stuff on here to like.  However, it was at the point where she had us holding out one hand with certain fingers touching and chanting ""har"" and promising this would ""cleanse my kidneys"" that I realized much of Kundalini yoga, like its creator, Yogi Bhajan, is just plain BS.  If you research enough on Yogi Bhajan you'll find incriminating, damning information that he was simply an imposter, a charlatan, who made up much of the practice on the spot during his classes.

Sorry, but holding one arm out and chanting ain't gonna cleanse anyone's kidneys.  That's just magical thinking, which is what most of ""Kundalini"" yoga is.  Exercises made up on the spot by a fake guru that have somehow become part of the yoga practice unfortunately.  There are indeed yoga poses that would help the internal organs but those are legit poses like twists.

If you doubt this review, watch the documentary ""Kumare"" and see how some gullible people in Phoenix adopt some silly movements from a fake guru thinking it's some sort of thousand of years old practice that he too made up on the spot.  My favorite is a sort of warrior pose but with a swinging arm that looks like ""air guitar"".  Seriously, watch Kumare, the doc and then try to watch this Maya Fiennes video with promises of kidney cleansing to realize just how ridiculous and gullible we humans are to engage in some unproven yoga poses, created in the 1970's by a fake guru with no credentials (search the web to confirm this) that are supposed to heal this and that without directly engaging those organs in some sort of actual pose.

Kundalini also has a lot of hyperventilation which I'm not sure really affords benefit and weirdly enough, so much of it is spent SITTING.  Recent NASA scientists have stated that lots of sitting shortens our lives.",1371945600,6,1847,4.634969325153374

2786868,4,B000NVKZW4,"I really enjoy this Kundalini Yoga DVD! It's easy to get into before the start of my morning. Maya Fiennes does an amazing job and her music selection is simply outstanding. Her music really allows me to get into the movement. I'm recently new to Kundalini Yoga and with the practice there is the warm up, kriyas, chanting, and meditation (resting point) at the end. I feel all of these elements are well incorporated and balanced in the DVD.

The reason for the four stars is that I wish you could pass the introduction at the beginning and just get straight to the workout. I also feel like I would have wanted to seen variations of kriyas - not just the one set of workouts. Having like 1 or 2 more sets of kriyas to detox and destress would have been more exciting and varied. However, I still LOVE this kriya and it definitely allows me to release the tension in my body and mind. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking about purchasing a Kundalini Yoga DVD.

2786883,5,B000NVKZW4,My main reason for doing Kundalini yoga was because of its focus on spirituality. Granted all yoga ultimately works on the union of the body/mind/spirit but I feel Kundalini is the one to go with if your main motivation is spiritual awakening. Maya does a great job with her combination serene background and fitting music. If I had anything I would Change it would be to make it a little shorter than an hour but that is ONLY because of my busy schedule.,1364515200,,455,4.493975903614458
2786884,5,B000NVKZW4,"Having hit a plateau with kundalini yoga workouts, I decided to try something heretical:  creative modification, using light hand weights, bands, a stability ball, variant positions.  My new approach has worked like a charm, particularly with Maya's ""Detox and Destress"" and ""Journey Through the Chakras"".  Although each of her workouts is well designed, my ""heretical"" modified versions energize me much more than the originals ever did. I especially recommend the bone-loading benefits of adding light hand weights to the arm movements, when safe to do so.  Mudras (symbolic hand configurations) are all well and good, but as a 66-year-old woman, ""why waste an opportunity for bone-loading"" has become my new motto!",1363305600,2,717,5.4324324324324325

2786889,5,B000NVKZW4,"This review is from: Kundalini Yoga to Detox and Destress with Maya Fiennes (DVD)
This is one of my favorite Kundalini yoga practices when I am physically or emotionally stressed. This practice always has me feeling better than when I started and lots of energy during the day and I definitely feel the detox effect.

There are many music mantras that I crave so much. I like the music and I hum to the chants in this video. ( Just wished I could find just the music)

I have researched many kundalini yoga DVDs and I keep coming back to Maya. I like how she is so easy going with the exercises that it is beneficial for me to follow.

When I don't do the DVD I find myself stressed and lack of energy. I feel like this is the best kundalini yoga for me--

You got to start somewhere and continue and it will do good for you
I do it 3 x a week usually on Monday Wednesday and Friday..between 8am- 10am
I wish I could do it everyday but I have a bad knee that doesn't allow me to do it more.

If I am bloated from stress, hormones or bad eating, there have been many times when I have been able to rid myself of the excess water shortly after finishing the practice.  The warm-up on Maya's DVD is one of my favorites and is very thorough; it even leaves me with a little buzz.  The music used on this DVD is better than average and I think it was created by Maya herself.  The set is totally white, which is not a favorite of mine, but since Kundalini is usually done with the eyes closed, that is a minor detail for me.  The only real con for me in this practice is all the New Age/Aquarian talk, especially at the beginning.  Still, this is a great practice and I hope the last detail would not put anyone off of trying it.",1360195200,,928,4.329479768786127

2786898,5,B000NVKZW4,"If you've taken Yoga classes (ashtanga, vinyasa, bikram) at a gym or studio before and are looking for something similar to do at home...
do a Google search of ""Kundalini"" before purchasing.

I am not a Kundalini expert, but my extremely simple, basic explanation, is that you are enabling your body's energy flow to increase from your base/root chakra through the other 7 chakra points.  Please read further into the physical, emotional, and spiritual benefits and manifestations associated with increased energy in each chakra.

Maya Fienness accomplishes this through a breathing and movement pattern done one-by-one for each chakra point.

If you're looking for strictly a yoga video to supplement or start a traditional yoga practice this is probably not for you.  As a person who has done yoga for years and in the past have done kundalini breathing and mediation exercises, I found also incorporating a movement to be very enjoyable and high recommend this video.",1359590400,,970,5.1528662420382165

And we hated it. It was relaxing at first, but then we got to the point where we couldn't stop laughing. By the time we were supposed to chant ""har,"" we were done. I would not recommend this if you are looking for just basic yoga moves. It is a different sort of practice that is not right for everyone.",1358294400,3,475,4.173913043478261
2786902,5,B000NVKZW4,"I love this video! The movements feel great. Also, the sequence is well planned, and ensures comfort throughout the routine. For example, one movement stretches your back and puts stress on your legs, and the next stretches and releases your legs. You will feel your muscles unknot and your joints unstiffen as you do the routine. Also, you will break a sweat -- not because the exercises are hard, but because certain simple movements are repeated until they become aerobic. Last but not least, the breathing. I've always had trouble breathing easily when asked to hold certain yoga poses. During this routine, however, I found that I was able to breathe along with her, and never missed a breath or forgot to breathe. Maybe it was the dynamic nature of the movements. Whatever the cause, the breathing vastly improved my experience.

The routine is set to fabulous music, and the layout (white on white) is clean and visually pleasing. I did not like the occasional references to the ""Aquarian Age"" and whatnot. However, that was a very minor setback, and I would gladly sit through it to reap the benefits of the routine.

The routine does not require any great degree of flexibility. After a couple of times, even absolute beginners will feel good doing it. I certainly plan to do it every day.",1356825600,,1298,4.790178571428571

However, don't let this fool you-you will feel ""worked out"" and possibly a little sick if you don't really hydrate before. I don't know why people are complaining about the backround and the lack of meditation when you traditionally keep your eyes closed, focusing on the third eye and repeating Sat Nam throughout Kundalini practice, but anyway, she's got wonderful energy and a sense of peace that really comes through. I like Ravi and Ana as well but she can be a bit too smiley for me, his voice kind of creeps me out and she does some things even in her basic videos that aren't safe for everyone.

This Kundalini yoga tape is a relaxing way to start feeling alive and energized again. For those who have never heard of Kundalini Yoga, it is rather different from Hatha yoga or other forms of yoga but it is so worthwhile and enjoyable. Maya Fiennes  comes across as kind and capable. I think there is value in this DVD for people of all ages and all levels of yoga practice.",1334275200,3,538,4.414141414141414
2786931,2,B000NVKZW4,"A yoga practicioner for many years, I had not yet tried kundalini yoga and admittedly did not know what to expect. I am sorry to say I was very dissappointed. There is no flow in this yoga, very few of the well known poses (no downward dog for example)  and no logical sequence. The teacher is very very chatty, sometimes she reminds one to breathe but the movements are so quick that I didn't yet figure out how to use the uyai breath here, though maybe one doesn't?. The music is not my taste either. If you are used to having your own practice this may not be your best choice. I gave it one star not two, because I did feel a little energised afterwards. My body is as still as before I started though!! I did think that it may be nice for people who cannot use their lower limbs well as there is a lot of arm action which in itself is interesting.",1331337600,,852,4.132530120481928

This is a great DVD that will become a regular practice for me. I really like how Maya explains why and how to do different techniques. The suimple white backdrop and her white clothing are soothing and not oversstimulating. And it was helpful to have her remind the viewer to breathe and go just a bit longer with each exercise. I can see myself taking a short break at work to do at least part of the exercises. Even if you are super fit this is a great detox practice. And if you're getting back into shape, this is a great way to do it. Become a kundalini yoga and Maya fan too!",1329868800,2,734,4.287769784172662
2786933,3,B000NVKZW4,"I took my first Kundalini class at a studio, liked it so much I decided I wanted to do it every day for 40 days straight. But how? I live 50 miles from the yoga studio, and there were only two kundalini classes in week, so I bought this video.

This Kundalini video includes sets, mantra chanting and Kundalini background music.  If you are used to going to a studio you may notice that Maya does not cover her head and that she does not end with ""Long Time Sun"" these are small details.  The exercises themselves you would find at any Kundalini class.

It doesn't seem at first like it's that much of a workout.  I had been doing regular Hatha yoga for about a year and a half before I stumbled on Kundalini.  This entire workout is sitting or lying down! You can do it in a small apartment.  You can do it on your rug with out any props, not even a mat.  Which is cool.  After 40 days in a row of doing this, I must say it WAS a work out, because I was powering through the Hatha yoga classes with strength I didn't know I had.

After finding this video I bought Gurmukh's video and also some by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh.  Gurmukh's was really hard for me, I still struggle to finish it.  Ana Brett and Ravi Singh have a convenient option on their dvd's called ""matrix"" so you can sequence your own workout length.  Because of that feature I started using their dvd's more often than this one.  I would still highly recommend this video - and encourage you to try doing it for 40 days in a row!

2786935,5,B000NVKZW4,"I purchased this DVD from my local Barnes & Noble not knowing what to expect. I am still recovering from a knee injury that I got a year ago so high impact workouts are no longer good to me. So gentle yoga was a good choice. I started with ""Yoga for the rest of us"" from Peggy Cappy which has a lot of soft and gentle movements that everyone could do (even senor citizens). After a while I was ready for some challenge and still concerned about my knee problem, I found kundalini yoga very interesting, when reading about different Yoga modalities so I decided to give this DVD a try and I am glad I did it!
After doing this I feel energized and in a good mood as well . For those who found the white background and teachers clothing boring, I found this to be very relaxing and allow me to focus on the teacher movements. Actually, there is a meditation at the end of this DVD there are some minutes to relax and be still, those expecting a ""guided meditation"" will not find it on this DVD. Movements are easy, gentle enough for beginners and not even the modified cat pose disturbs my sensitive knee. That being said, I believe Maya is a wonderful teacher and I am looking forward to get her other DVDs in the future, but for now...this is all I need!",1325635200,,1253,4.2468619246861925

I really enjoyed this video; it was good exercise, the music was fun and fit with the exercises without giving the ""jazzercise"" feel that some videos have.  It was a little new-agey, but I liked that since it helpped with the relaxation process for me.  The only complaint I have about this video is that there wasn't a huge amount of instruction on the poses and that might have been hard for someone with no experience with kundalini yoga.  I took one class, 10 years ago and I was fine, but if you don't know how to do breath of fire, there isn't a description of that here.

Maya's own music is on this, and her mixes are really so nice to listen to, they really aid in the effect of the entire workout. Her method is user-friendly, and very approachable so even if you are new to kundalini you will feel uninhibited in getting started.
This video does not use my favorite types of kriya's but when I was first starting out at home with kundalini and tried this, I was pleased. As you expand more, you can decide for yourself which methods and kriyas you prefer, but those she used do work great for getting your system detoxed.",1309305600,4,829,4.42483660130719
2786941,5,B000NVKZW4,"I have several Ravi and Ana Kundalini DVD's but on someone's recommendation, I tried Maya Fiennes and I'm a convert. This really is a destressing workout and your spine will feel amazing afterward. Yes, Maya talks about the Aquarian Age coming in 2012. It's fairly benign and only in the first chapter which is about 2 minutes of her talking.

Maya is a great instructor, warning you when something might make beginners dizzy and encouraging you to break through if you are getting tired (one move near the end definitely was more challenging than it looked.) I find her very soothing. I also like little things like when she says to stretch if you need to, she stops and stretches herself. The corpse pose at the end is actually several minutes of corpse pose too, not just a ""Stay in savasana as long as you need to"" followed by the DVD chapter abruptly ending and loud credits music coming on. These small but thoughtful touches make me feel like Maya really is doing the workout with me.

And full disclosure--maybe it's just the oxygenation, but one exercise makes me laugh. It just makes me ridiculously happy. I love this DVD. Try it-the exercises work even if you don't get into the patter. I'm convinced-I'm ordering the rest of her workouts.

Nothing is too strenuous on here but if you have some kind of spinal injury, there may be moves you can't do as with any yoga workout.",1305331200,9,1387,4.607287449392713

This dvd is like going to a class! Ms. Fiennes' voice and words are lovely, the music is timed perfectly with the kriyas and the setting is so peaceful, the setting being an all white room, nothing to get distracted by. I love how she times her movements with the music, some of the kriyas can last while with repetitive movements, so making it a dance of sorts helps not think 'AHHHHH MY ARMS WILL FALL OFF!' I felt lovely afterwards, I got my heart rate up and felt like I'd done something really good for me. The only thing I think could be improved upon is explaining the Breath of Fire. It can be a little tricky, some people not used to breathwork might hyperventilate. This is a dvd I could do again and again without getting tired of it. As my yoga practice has fallen off in the past years I've been looking for some inspiration to make time for myself and be a more diligent with my practice. This dvd did that!

At first I had a 48 hour rental, but when the rental expired I found myself wanting to practice this again so I bought it.

The title is accurate - it's definitely great for destressing. I tend to prefer videos broken into sections or matrices so that I can choose my workout and vary it by how much time I have or vary the sequence, but this is simply an hour of practice. That's fine as that is probably the nature of Kundalini yoga - it's more about spiritual health and mental well-being, and whatever movement involved is simply to facilitate the mind-body connection, not actual exercise.

I rated the video as a 4 as it's well done, it serves its purpose (detox and destress), and Maya Fiennes seems like an expert in this. However, Kundalini yoga itself is probably not my thing so I probably won't do it often.",1297123200,2,835,4.680272108843537

viewing I knew I was going to buy it.  Even before the routine started,
I had an emotional response to the background music, I felt like crying.
The kriyas that involve the arms were intense for me but I kept up and
endured.  The payoff was great I felt so relaxed when I finished.  My body
was vibrating and humming like never before.  I guess I had a lot of stuck
energy, these past few years have been very stressful for me.  I don't know
if the theories behind this eastern tradition of yoga are true, as far a trapped energies
and trapped emotion.  But, at one point during the routine I felt a welling up
of emotion around my chest and shoulders.  I've been using the dvd daily and
it's much easier to do and I don't have any of the strange, yet magical, experiences
that I first experienced.  Maybe I'm not as energetically clogged, I've detoxed I guess.
I do, however, still feel great after completing the routine.  I highly recommend this

I love it!  I use it when I need to feel more centered and energized, and the best part about it is that when I am done I don't feel like I'm coming out of a coma but it doesn't seem like just an exercise DVD either.

It's amazing how an absence of distractions (such as odd clothing or a busy backdrop) helps with focus. Fiennes has a calm, clear voice backed by soothing music. Nothing much more than 'easy pose' -- a simple, cross-legged sitting position -- is required through most of the video, although it seems as if caution should be exercised in terms of repeating some of the movements the same number of times as the instructor does if you are new to yoga or if you have neck, shoulder or lower back problems.

Before picking Maya Fiennes DVD I had seen a preview of it and thought ""Oh my gosh what crappy music""  So I stayed away.  But I am glad something forced me to get this DVD.

The new agey music is really not that bad... I quite enjoy it and I quite enjoy how she integrates the rhythm of the music to the patterns of the workout.... its unique and awesome.  It helps you to get through those harder repetitive segments.  Its like music therapy.

You don't get like a sweat your but off workout like some of Denise Austin's YogaBurn DVDs, but you do feel an internal combustion going on.  Despite it not being an intense workout, the next day I could really feel the muscles having to be worked underneath my armpits, side arms, front thighs and legs!!!  Places no other workout video has well.... never worked out before.

I truly enjoy this DVD.  I get a wonderful vibe from Maya.  She explains things well except for her beath of fire rendition.  If you're new to Kundalini you would not have known you are suppose to create this breath originating from your belly.  You see her doing it, but she doesn't tell you how to do it.

My favorite part is that she allows for little breaks in between exercises.  Also, her ending where you stop and just enjoy the ending of your session.  Its such a powerful body and mind DVD.

2786970,5,B000NVKZW4,"I have been a yoga practitioner for most of my 61 years. I have never found a fitness program as effective as this one for detoxing and de-stressing.

As an author and a web developer, my lifestyle had gotten very sedentary in recent years. I allowed deadlines to push exercise to the sidelines and developed work habits that led eventually to an increasingly debilitating autoimmune disorder. I badly needed to get back into shape, so I returned to my tried and true Hatha Yoga, but to no avail. Bikram did not do the job. Raquel's demanding routine helped but went only so far. Shiva Rea was a treat for the eyes, but the yoga style was not so effective for me. A handful of other DVDs were purchased but soon passed on to friends.

Nothing moved my rapidly aging body back toward wellness until I found this DVD. Within days of its arrival, my body was singingly happy and had started to shed unwanted pounds. In less than a month of daily practice, I had lost over 6 pounds and several inches, my blood tests had improved, and my energy level had reached heights I'd assumed were long gone. I felt 10 years younger. I quickly ordered the other Maya Fiennes DVDs and am still waiting eagerly for the two sets from the UK to arrive.

Despite my years of yoga experience, Kundalini yoga was totally new to me. Thank goodness, Maya Fiennes is an extraordinary teacher. This DVD is challenging in the beginning but even a total beginner or someone in poor health can catch the moves readily with Maya's instruction. The DVD contains a most amazing set of postures, and Maya's pacing is wonderful and intimate, as if she can see right into one's being and accurately gauge one's level of fitness. The music is exhilarating, to say the least. My husband joined me on the first viewing and is totally hooked. These days, he is usually the one to get me off my computer and back to work on my yoga mat. In fact, I think he's a little bit in love with Maya. She's genuinely inspiring, sincere and just so darn cute!

This DVD is perfect in every regard. I encourage every yoga lover I know to order a copy and have probably hand-sold at least a dozen copies in the last month. It gets my highest recommendation.",1284249600,16,2205,4.477611940298507

I've gotten more flexible, more at peace, and have helped some old injuries which were really bothering me.

The workout is challenging, but not intimidating, and Maya is a wonderful teacher.  When I finish, I am tingling all over and I feel great.  The music is very beautiful, and it's a beneficial addition in terms of motivation.  I just discovered Kundalini Yoga about a month ago, and I'm wishing I had run across it in the 1960s when it came to this country.  It's marvelous for both the body and the spirit.

2786992,5,B000NVKZW4,"If you want to get into yoga and feel its benefits without feeling like it's out of your league, this is the best DVD for anyone.  When my family first bought this DVD, I had never done yoga before.  I've never been flexible, and I thought yoga was out of my league.  My family said I should give it a try because it's easy to do.  After I did it for the first time, I had never felt as relaxed and as energized as I did that day.

Maya Fiennes's program excels on all levels.  The exercises are easy to do, even for people like me who aren't flexible or athletic.  Every time I finish the DVD, I have more energy and less stress and fatigue.  It gives me energy throughout the day and helps me get a good night's sleep.  Plus, she sends out a lot of positive energy; it's obvious that she loves what she does, and she wants others to enjoy it, too.  (A side note--as a musician, I love that she composed and performed the music for this program.)

The whole program is great, but there are a couple minor downsides.  She begins and ends the program with meditating, and there are mantras and chanting ""Har, har, har"" at times.  But yoga programs typically have meditating and chanting, so it's to be expected.  The other issue I have is that there's a lot of downtime in between exercises.  Even when I did this the first time, I fast-forwarded through most of the downtime and chants and didn't feel like I was missing anything.  I think there could have been a few more exercises in between, but as with any workout program, it's different for different people.

Whether you're athletic or just starting exercise programs, Maya Fiennes's workout will leave you relaxed and energized.  As for me, I've been doing her workout twice a week since October 2009, and even though my family and I have other yoga DVDs, this is by far my favorite, and I'm glad to give it my highest recommendation.",1279152000,,1892,4.403458213256484

I admit I'm not sure about the usual Kundalini claims of ""detoxifying breaths,"" etc., but something about her calm and friendly personality makes me feel that she is compassionate and allows me to focus on my healing rather than be distracted by negative thoughts that I sometimes have about some other very cold and not-so-bright sounding instructors. I was amazed that I could do this entire DVD (with breaks or shortened segments) multiple days in a row without causing too much pain or more exhaustion than usual. It helps that she uses different breathing techniques for each exercise to focus on while getting through, and also that most of the DVD is done sitting, and some lying down. I really did find this uplifting, and think it would be good for people with chronic severe illnesses or disabilities who do have spine mobility.
(I also recommend Sarah Bates' ""Yoga for Healing,"" which is specially designed for de-stressing and strengthening people with disabilities and illnesses - including the bed-bound - as well as ""Sit and Be Fit for Fibromyalgia,"" whose instructor and creator, registered nurse Mary Ann Wilson, has created possibly hundreds of episodes aired by PBS for people who are older or with limited mobility/balance to get or stay in shape.)",1279152000,2,1819,4.723270440251572
2786994,5,B000NVKZW4,"Maya Fiennes is one of my Favourite Kundalini Yoga Teachers on DvD!

This Kundalini yoga class is one of my favourties!

Set on a beautiful white background the production is good and the music (which is Maya herself) is lovely and inspires you to go on in the sets.

The Kundalini yoga class begins with tune in via mantra, next is the warm up section which i find very beneficial and prepares my body and mind for the sets which come next. I find the sets energising and also fun and there are some short periods of meditation/rest inbetween which I like. The class ends with a relaxation in savasana (lying down 'corpse pose') and then a tune out to end. Maya gives good instruction and encouragement throughout the class. Following the class I feel energised yet calm at the same time, this follows into the day (I do morning practice).

I work within my own limits on any given day and each day is different for me as to what I can achieve.

I had been practicing Hatha yoga for approx one year prior to discovering Kundalini yoga. My main practice is now Kundalini Yoga.

Update..18th May 2010
This DVD Kundalini Yoga class was my first introduction to this type of yoga and I am so glad that I made the purchase as over a year later it is still a firm favourite in my rotation of DVD classes which include all of Maya's classes (Journey through the chakra's), Ana and Ravi's, Gurumkh, Gurutej, Erin Kamler and Carolyn Cowan. Kundalini Yoga works for me...I have clearly 'clicked' with this beautiful practice and resonate with it completely.

This DVD is worked with regularly, at least once a week! I find the class enjoyable, calming, energizing and grounding and I am totally at ease with Maya. A wonderful class, thank you Maya!",1278547200,,1739,4.572347266881029

2786996,5,B000NVKZW4,"I LOVE THIS DVD!!!!  A beautiful meditation/exercise.  I always feel so wonderful after I finish this DVD.  Her voice and the beautiful way she explains all the movements is so serene and yet I feel I am accomplishing a physical exercise as well.  In the beginning you have to keep your eyes open to be sure you are doing all the moves right but once you get them down and can keep them closed you will be surprised at how deep and inward you can go.  It is what she calls ""active meditation"" and it is great!!",1268784000,,510,4.216494845360825
2786997,3,B000NVKZW4,"I've tried a couple of kundalini DVD's. Typically I enjoy the physical aspects of the workout: it is different from traditional yoga in a good, complementary way. But equally typically, I seem to dislike the music to which the workout takes place and the tone / attitude of the commentary. This is somewhat less true for this DVD than for the Ana Brett one, but still true!",1259020800,3,373,4.582089552238806

I started using this while my son was being treated for cancer and it lifted the fog from my mind and made me feel so much better physically.  I really look forward to doing this almost everyday, and sometimes I will pop it in a second time if I can.  I especially love it because it is almost 100% done in easy pose which is a sitting pose so before or after a rough day this seems much less intimidating than a traditional yoga dvd.",1244073600,14,605,4.067226890756302

Luckily I have been working out for several months so was able to follow her routine with no problems--and although it is a simple routine its impact is amazing.  One of the biggest pluses is that anyone can follow this routine and feel positive and energized very quickly. Maya's low key, positive outlook makes you feel no ""push"" to overextend and actually insists that you relax, enjoy and laugh thru the moment.  What a delightful experience.

2787006,5,B000NVKZW4,"I have Relapse Remitting MS and I do this DVD nearly every day. I recently had a 3 month relapse consisting of double vision, fatigue and numbness/weakness in my legs. I was nearly unable to walk for weeks and had to go on IV Prednisone which is very taxing on the entire mind body and spirit. Without this DVD I would have lost it! I was able to do at least the first thirty minutes throughout the entire ordeal and found it to be profoundly theraputic and transformative. The music is fantastic and Maya's words of encouragement seemed tailored just for me.
This DVD is exactly what I needed and I am grateful for it. I understand that experienced Yogis may find it ""too easy"" but I think it is fantastic and has something to offer everyone. I have reccomended it to everyone in my MS support group because it is so theraputic and you can benefit from it even if you are physically disabled.",1227484800,21,893,4.418181818181818

It's actually fun! Your mostly on the floor twisting and stretching (with some intense breathing at some points of course). She has a great voice and explains the hows and whys of the movements. The music helps to keep in time with her and keep going when your pooped. Normally, I want to turn off the music in my videos, but this was just perfect for the exercises.

I would definitely purchase another dvd from her.",1218326400,12,671,4.403225806451613

2787021,4,B000NVKZW4,"Initial Warning: New Age Cheese Factor is present in this DVD. My boyfriend walked in on me right as Maya was encouraging me to ""become the New Aquarian Person!"" and he burst out laughing. I don't mind it, being something of a low-key hippy person who talks to her plants and worries about her chakras, but although Boyfriend was interested in joining me for this work out (it does a lot of back stretching and flexing, which since he has a very tense, stiff back, looked appealing to him) he didn't think he could make it through and keep a straight face.

His loss. Still, if being told to become ""the new Aquarian Person!"" or ""We will now chant to strengthen the kidneys"" will utterly ruin your enjoyment of a practice, you might, ah, wanna rent this one first. Just in case.

Now, on to the review proper:

This routine can be fairly intense if you're not in shape. It's fun, I like it very much, but it can be quite the work out considering you don't actually *stand up* at any time. That being said, I'm not in the most phenomenal shape of my life at the moment and I can finish this practice. And I enjoy it very much indeed! It is currently part of my regular yoga rotation and I often do the warm up portion of the DVD even on days when I am not doing the full practice. It's very dynamic: you will not hold anything but corpse pose and easy pose. And it's all done sitting or kneeling. Props are not necessary even for We the Inflexible Yogis and Yoginis of the World, which I think would make it great for travel, although I do tend to sit on my yoga mat when I do this practice.

Kundalini yoga is very different from the other hatha yoga styles I've been exposed to. But it's fun, it made my back feel FANTASTIC, the music is great, and I felt reinvigorated and centered after it was done.",1210550400,166,1802,4.275659824046921
2787022,4,B000NVKZW4,"I really enjoy this dvd. Maya gives a sense of peace and I love the music. In other reviews, people commented about the plainness of the video. The reality is, you're supposed to do the exercises with your eyes closed, so you don't actually watch the dvd. You'll watch it the first few times to understand the poses, but after that you'll be LISTENING to it more than watching it. Knowing this, Maya concentrates on giving us good music and encouraging words instead of a visual show.",1205971200,11,484,4.574712643678161
2787023,5,B000NVKZW4,"I really, really like this DVD.

I have been a yoga student for a couple of years but am new to Kundalini - I have been looking for something more meditative.  I have a number of DVDs that I can't ever even seem to get though.  This DVD is really well made.  The quality (filming, editing etc) is great, the music is surprisingly amazing (I end up having her music in my head for the rest of the day), Maya feels very genuine and focused and seems to have all the right stuff for good instruction.

I would definitely recommend it.",1203379200,6,531,4.217821782178218

I sit at a computer all day so this is a great way to loosen and relax the muscles of the neck, shoulders and back.  If I can't make it to the gym for the day - I look forward to doing this routine.  I wouldn't mind  buying Maya's music - she is great!",1196812800,15,556,4.009090909090909
2787026,5,B000NVKZW4,"I think Maya Fiennes has created a wonderful DVD and I cannot wait until she makes more.  Everything presented in the DVD is doable and at the same time challenging because of length of the repetitions and the requirement for coordination (breath, movement, focus).  The music is excellent--both calming and centering.

2787029,5,B000NVKZW4,"Maya is a fantastic teacher -- I love it that she tells you exactly what the movements are doing for you:  ie:  this is draining your lymph nodes, this is massaging your kidneys, this is working your waistline, this will open up the flow of blood to your head to prevent headaches.  Some Kundalini programs I've tried (ie: Gurmukh) are just TOO MUCH for me right now -- maybe someday I'll be able to do them, but for now, this is the perfect pace, leaving me energized and making me feel great, not defeated.

Also, the music is just WONDERFUL and that's what really matters in a practice you do with your eyes closed.  Really inspiring!",1191801600,56,637,4.456896551724138

8182090,5,B000NVKZW4,I love this!  Maya is a vocalist  I to sing and find the workouts simply wonderful for my instrument.  The chants are uplifting and take me to a wonderful place of meditation.  I must admit I was not able to do the entire program in the beginning.  However I consider each day I move further into the workout that I am on a journey.  I love owning this so that I may take my time with it.  I did reach the end eventually and loved the way my body worked within the intensity of the work out.  I'd recommend it to anyone especially vocalist or instrumentalist.  On word though.  Because the workout is not hard but intense it is important that you listen to your body.  Sometimes some of the movements make me dizzy so I relax and go at my own pace or take a rest between movements. It helps me to work with focus and enjoy the workout more!
