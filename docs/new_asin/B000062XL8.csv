Very impressive directing. There are a lot of breathtaking nature scenes that give the movie a genuine serenity and balance that is often underutilized in these movies. The training scenes are pretty incredible. And it's worth keeping an eye on the these since the moves all come back during the battles.

Get this on VHS.",1416614400,,504,4.651685393258427

I saw this flick "" The wandering Monk aka Shaolin Monk Fighs Back"" in my early teen,,and remember really enjoying it. After searing high and low for this flick,,I came across it in Paris, France in 2004. This is not your typical 5 star movie, but more like 4 stars,,,,but for me,,this flick was one of the few which really developed my passion for old school kung fu,,therefore, I cannot give it anything less than 5 stars!! The old school kung fu is absolutely amazing,,if you enjoy the crane style,,this movie depict that immensely. The fight scenes are frequent and nothing less than amazing, the story is great and the choreography off the chizzel!! Rest assured,,,you can't, and will not go wrong with this one in your collection!!",1151712000,,828,4.956834532374101
