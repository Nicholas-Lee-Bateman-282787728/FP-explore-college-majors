1419726,5,B00005B1ZM,"Jacques Tati's farewell to Monsieur Hulot is also a deep, insightful, sad and funny reflection on the modern age.  The old Paris that Hulot loved in Holiday and moved in and out of in Mon Oncle -- the Paris we think of when we long to visit -- is completely gone here.  (The closing scene in Mon Oncle, where Hulot drives past an anonymous airport, presages the modernity that has overwhelmed Paris in Playtime.)  Hulot's Paris of the 1950s is all steel, glass, and consumerism.  Human contact seems impossible at first.  But as the day passes into night (and then into day again), individuality replaces structure, and Hulot's humanity ultimately conquers modern sterility.  This wonderfully compassionate story is also remarkably funny, though these are smiling long-lasting laughs, not belly laughs.
Ignore the negative comments about the picture quality of the VHS from the first two reviewers.  The DVD is soooo much better than the VHS -- it is impossible to describe the improvement.  As for the 2.35:1 vs. 1.85:1 issue, all I can say is that I loved the film as presented by Criterion.  I have no idea if I would love it more in its full aspect.
This is one of the great achievements in cinema -- don't miss it.",991526400,39,1219,4.739336492890995
1419727,5,B00005B1ZM,"How fine to have a splendid new digital transfer from Criterion of Tati's masterwork!  The humor, while brilliant, is often subtle; no comedian ever found more humor in inanimate objects (and, as here, design) than Tati.  Mr. Hulot isn't front and center in PLAYTIME; the main character's Paris, denatured and dehumanized by modernism.  (One of the picture's funniest, and most poignant, images is the rapid, lonely reflection of the Eiffel Tower in a quickly-opened skyscraper door.)  Viewers will have fun finding the abundent sight gags on display, frequently somewhere on the periphery of the action; this is one movie that should richly repay repeated viewings.  (Keep an eye peeled for the travel posters!)  Pleasant, if somewhat unilluminating, intro from Terry Jones.  An essential disc.",991008000,5,795,5.362903225806452
1419748,4,B00005B1ZM,"There is not much to add to the many highly articulate reviews here, but it's important to mention, for those readers alarmed by another reviewer's coverage of the original ""anamorphic flagging"" error with this release, that Criterion discovered the error almost immediately and very quickly issued a second printing of this disc with the error CORRECTED. Especially for an error which did not even affect the main feature on the disc, ""A moron in a hurry"" seems a grossly unfair comment given Criterion's superlative track record for quality and attention to detail!
Unfortunately, the only way to distinguish a First Printing copy of this disc from a Second Printing one (without actually taking the disc home and playing it) is to check the fine print at the bottom of the back panel of the disc box, where it will clearly state which printing it is. Buying online, we would need the cooperation of the fine folk at Amazon in doing this. :)
Likewise, given Criterion's reputation as cinephiles, any doubts about the correctness of this transfer's aspect ratio should be laid to rest, as the amount of ""overscan"" present in any individual television accounts for perhaps nine out of ten such reports of minute cropping or ""clipping"" of the screen image.",1028678400,5,1255,4.95260663507109
1419749,3,B00005B1ZM,"I don't propose to write lengthing about Tati's masterpiece; I shall merely reiterate that Playtime is the 2001 of comedies.
My issues are with the quality of presentation on the DVD.
The transfer of the mono mix of the 35mm print of the film is as good as can be expected, and the subtitling adds another dimension over the International version, picking out ""key"" bits of dialogue (although none is essential). The sleeve notes explain that the location of the original elements, and thus the 65mm negative and stereo (or quadrophonic!) soundtrack have been lost, for the time being, but I urge you not to be put off by this.
It has already been discussed that some 4:3 material has been flagged as anamorphic, such that a television will stretch out images that should never have been stretched, causing some problems with subtitles being distorted. This is annoying and sloppy, requiring a manual correction when viewed each time; a moron in a hurry should have spotted this error, and I am very diappointed that Criterion have not been more punctilious.
Further, the very end of the film is supposed to be a fade to black while the music keeps playing to the end; there is about 30s overlap there. However, on this transfer, the music fades out as soon as the film is over. This gives the film an abrupt ending which has a very different effect to the proper version, as released by the British Film Institute on VHS in the UK.
Having said that, I urge you still to buy this disc, as it is good enough to get a high quality of this great film into your home. I am just disappointed at Criterion.",1022889600,21,1600,4.578397212543554
1419750,5,B00005B1ZM,"Tati spent years working on this, the summa of all his comedic direction. PLAYTIME is a study of a day and night in an unrecognizable Paris, where modernist architecture have all but obliterated the city everyone remembers. Tati's point is that this is what urban life has done to Western civilization worldwide (indeed, in the film we frequently see travel posters advertising foreign cities where the same ugly concrete skyscraper appears, blocking out the views of more distinctive landmarks behind it.) But Tati's genius is that he doesn't linger on nostalgia: no matter what has been lost, Tati's characters must move forward and make do with what they've been given. This point is gorgeously made in the film when, fleetingly, the cupolas of Sacre Coeur and the spire of the Eiffel Tower are seen as reflections in glassed doorways. As we see these reflected images, the characters in the film look back at these pre-contemporary landmarks, softly sigh, and then move forward with the modernist Paris they have been given to work in and with.
But the pleasure of PLAYTIME is that this modernist Paris may be ugly but it's all a kind of glass-and-cement playground for adults: everything in Tati's Paris is breaking down and is hopelessly confusing, but this is a source of tremendous fun for the viewer--and ultimately, for the film's participants. The story follows Tati's French Everyman, the endearingly clumsy Monsieur Hulot, as his path takes him in and out of a group of American tourists (their dialogue, written by Art Buchwald, becomes most memorable when they visit a technology fair: ""Ooh, and it's so pratical!"" one of them intones, as she watches a model demonstrate new eyeglasses with lift-up lenses for doing one's eyeshadow.) Although Hulot's confusion with modernity inevitably brings chaos in his wake, just about everyone adores him, and by the end of the film he's memorably charmed the prettiest of the tourists. Also by the film's brilliant ending the triumph of this sense of postmodern ""play"" is firmly in place: everytime I see this film I choke up at the end (and can't explain why) when the traffic circle becomes brilliantly transformed (by Tati's brilliant editing and choreography) into a kind of funfair. There's something very moving in seeing that, finally, that Tati reaffirms this landscape of modernity as a space for fun and play, rather than for alienation and disintegration.
I was very lucky to have first seen this film in the Eighties on a widescreen, at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. It's just about impossible to see this film this way anymore, and it's a great shame: the widescreen ratio was employed to full use by Tati, and there's often something going on on both sides of the screen that the current DVD format can't pick up. But this is small potatoes: this film is a masterpiece, and deserves to be seen in any format.",1019347200,5,2887,4.94238683127572
1419751,5,B00005B1ZM,"Playtime is comedy focused on detail.  Many people find the film inaccessible because of its unconventional approach to storytelling.  There _is_ a plot, and it is relatively straightforward, but the film is so removed from its dialogue (most of it isn't really audible, and is unsubtitled) that we must follow it visually.  The film is also detached dramatically:  There is so much going on within the frame that it can be difficult to know which events are connected to the main plot of the film, and which are connected to the rest of the film only thematically.  Additionally, there are few occasions where the director guides our attention through close-ups, key lighting, or other conventional means.  This means that the film is only likely to appeal to those who enjoy the comedy without the need for a conventional plot, or to those who look farther into the film (or both).  Probably this is why the film was a commercial failure.
The film is visually dense: There are people wandering in and out of the frame constantly, and on many occasions there is more than one visual gag occurring at the same time.  I doubt that there are any sections of the frame that are not used at some point in the film as a crucial element of some joke.  Many of the jokes occur singly, and many of them are linked thematically to others throughout the scene, or throughout the film.  Because of this, as a visual comedy this film is as close to music as I can imagine--at times it is acted out much like ballet (elements of synchronicity and counterpoint are common in this film).  I don't know of any film that has this level of choreographed detail (not even Peter Greenaway).
The film is more than just style, however.  All of its jokes exist under certain themes that run throughout the film.  On the most readily apparent level, the film is about modernization (it seems to be set in the near future, but this is not explicit).  Concrete and glass have consumed the world, and the people in it are completely superficial.  In contrast to this, there exists Mr. Hulot, an awkward character that is consistently baffled by everything around him.  At times, however, Tati shows us that the modern sensibility is just a delicate facade (chaos ensues at the restaurant), and that underneath it there can exist a very human playfulness (the extended carousel metaphor at the end).
On another level, the film is about cinema and television.  There is a consistent theme of voyeurism.  Much of the film is shot through glass windows--mostly interior scenes filmed from outside.  At one point in the film, all the action occurs inside an apartment building where each living room has a wall-sized window.  The entire scene is shot from outside, and the building looks very much like a television.  At one point during this scene, one group of people sit down to watch TV, while another group of people in the apartment next to them are do the same.  They react to what they see on the screen as if they were watching the events in the other apartment (both TV's are in the same wall, and they are facing each other).  At one point a man in the second apartment begins to undress, and almost in response the father in the first apartment sends his daughter out of the room.
Unfortunately, Criterion was unable to procure the 70mm print (actually the 65mm camera negative) of this film--apparently the only acceptable one in existence.  The Tati estate will not allow anyone to use it until someone does a complete restoration (this makes sense: each time that the print is used, it becomes more damaged).  Fortunately, Criterion has found good 35mm elements and put out a pristine transfer.  The image quality is about as it could be under the circumstances.  Without their efforts, this film would surely have been treated very poorly on DVD, if at all.
Despite other reviewers' comments to the contrary, I believe that the original ratio of this film is 1.85.  According to the IMDB this is true, and if you observe the composition of the frame, you will notice that everything fits neatly into it (yes, this includes the opening credits and the drooping plane model mentioned previously by reviewers).  If you haven't found a way to eliminate the overscanning on your television, you may miss some of the details, or elements of the frame will fall off the edge of your screen.  That's how densely Tati has packed this frame.  It can be hard to discern certain details (such as a wedding ring) that would be easy to see in 70mm, but here the fault is not with the transfer, nor with the source print, but simply with the resolution of DVD in general.  This film was meant to be seen in the theater (though you probably won't get a chance to anytime soon--so buy the dvd!).  As for the sound quality, while the soundtrack is important, Tati intentionally muted the dialogue, and other elements are pretty clear, so it is more than adequate.  This is the best that could be done with the materials, and I doubt that the sound quality was ever that great (even in 70mm).  I believe that if you are not satisfied with this DVD, it is simply because the format itself is not good enough for such a large film.  For a DVD, it could hardly be better.
There is a defect on the disc:  the interview with Terry Jones and the short film, Cours du Soir, were encoded as anamorphic, even though they are full frame.  As a result, they are flattened vertically.  On some players this is unfixable, but on others you can fiddle with the player to present it correctly (you have to do this while it is running).  It is unfortunate, but this dvd is otherwise outstanding.",1018742400,10,5644,4.638832997987928
1419752,5,B00005B1ZM,"Nothing is what it really seems, it's much more absurd!  And also humorous!  This is a lovely film to watch and see and hear.  (Watch out, modern cities, you're forgetting about people.  And watch out, people, you're forgetting what you are.)  Tati's loving humour feels like a delightful story told by an imaginary grandpa.  Don't worry about dubbing or subtitles, there's no dialogue.  It's a visual feast.",1002585600,5,408,5.0
1419753,5,B00005B1ZM,"OK, this is an amazing film. of course. every time i've seen it, either at home or in the theater, i have been completely captivated.  It is by turns charming, hilarious, and jittering with energy.  It builds into frenzies, distracting the viewer from the pleasant fact that there is little to tie the film together, no true main characters, and almost no dialogue.
about the dvd transfer. first of all, the only 70mm print left in existence is owned by Jacques Tati's family, who does not release it to anyone. so what we have to work with are 35mm prints and 16mm prints. this is a nice transfer--plenty of color, no scratches, and so on.
what's more, criterion collection should be commended for even releasing a DVD in the first place.  for any lover of the film, it's a real treat to get to have it around to watch all the time. The VHS was appalling, unlistenable, and well, VHS (need i go into the faults of the medium??).
I'm glad to have it; I enjoy being able to turn off the subtitles; and i think technical critique is really trifling and tiresome.  If you can see this film in the theater, GO SEE IT IMMEDIATELY. otherwise, get the dvd. it's a brilliant film.",996192000,22,1172,4.462616822429907
1419754,3,B00005B1ZM,"Both the introduction (by Terry Jones) and the blurb on this DVD talk about Tati's ""70mm"" epic.

1419755,5,B00005B1ZM,"Playtime by Jacques Tati is a remarkable movie. It is a comedy and sweet commentary on the perseverance of man even when immersed in a city of steel and glass. For this last Hulot movie, Tati leaves the Paris of the Seine and places us in the 1960 emerging Paris of modern towers and thick transparent doors. In Playtime we not only follow Hulot, but a number of characters within this maze of stunning industrial architecture.
While predominately thought of as a comedy, Tati in Playtime attempts to answer larger questions than a fumbling Hulot is able to muddle through alone.  Through each character we see into and around the impersonal technology that revolutionized our lives and environment. Playtime doesn't ask why this happened, but it does ask how can we live in this cold cacophony where our ideals become only reflections in a door.
One supposes that the answers have something to do with the young photographer trying desperately to take the picture of a flower vendor absurdly juxtaposed outside a stark gray office tower while remarking, ""this is Paris"". Or maybe it exists within the dilemma of choosing a prepared meal under a bright neon sign which makes all the food ghostly green. On the surface we see the humour and below we feel the exquisite simplicity of Tati's whimsically rigorous proof of life.
Playtime is a gift of sight and sound that should not be missed. It is medicine of the most wonderful taste and a vicarious curative for any person in these modern times.",994291200,6,1495,4.794573643410852
1419756,5,B00005B1ZM,"Playtime is not Tati's last picture. It was ""Traffic"".

You may even find that many of the interior views in this film look as if they could have appeared in a recent Architectural Record.",991699200,5,432,5.3088235294117645
7936236,5,B00005B1ZM,"When I first saw this movie, I thought I wasn't going to like it because it doesn't really have a substantive plot.

There is a short film included ""Cours du Soir"" Night School and in it is a short segment he presents on fishing that is worth the cost of the movie all by itself! By all means enjoy it!",1313971200,,510,4.161616161616162
7936238,5,B00005B1ZM,"What makes this film truly a gem, is the fact that there isn't a single film in movie history that you can compare it to.  Probably the closest would be his last appearance as Monsieur Hulot, in Traffic.  In Playtime, Hulot's 3rd appearance, it's just Tati wandering around a mechanized Paris, running into hinderances along the way.  This a a charming comedy, and not a laugh out loud one.  It does have it's funny moments, and you really need a second or even third viewing to appreciate all that is appearing on screen.  I love just popping this one in, and letting it play while I am doing things around the house.  With it not having a plot, you can jump in at any time, and catch glimpses of it here and there without missing much.  It's probably the only movie of it's kind you can do that with.

This film literally emptied Tati's pocket's getting it made with the costly sets and hundreds of extras.  However, he pressed on and got it completed, much to the film going world's benefit.  It's a pleasant trip down a the lane of a film maker's mind we will probably never come close to gazing into again.  There just aren't any films around like this anymore, as the days of sight gags, and silent comedians are long over.  Hopefully it will get re-issued soon, either by Criterion or another company.  It deserves to be in print, and the UK apparently doesn't have any licensing issues, as it's in current release over there.

As far as the debate over the aspect ratio is concerned, I do know this:  I had a Toshiba DVD player at one time, which had a unique feature of zooming out, as well as zooming in.  When I zoomed out, it made the film look even wider screen, but the important factor was, that it showed me a few millimeters more on either side, which I couldn't see on my other TV and DVD player.  In a film like this, which is full of long shots, and lots of people and things happening in every corner, it was a benefit to have that feature.  That was of course, until that DVD player of mine broke.  So there is actually more on the transfer, it's just that with every TV and DVD player cutting off a tiny bit on the sides, you lose a little something.  I wanted to see this film when it ran on the big screen for a limited time about 2 years ago, but it only hit select cities and didn't come near me.  Seeing it in the theater must be a huge treat!

One tip if you are searching out the Criterion out of print version is to make sure you ask who you are buying it from, whether it says first printing or second printing in small print on the lower back of the case.  You want the second printing.  The DVD is rare to find either way, but the second printing is much, much rarer, as you either had to trade your first printing into Criterion to get the corrected version, or find it in the stores, if they even stocked the second one prior to it going out of print.  The difference is the first version had an incorrect aspect ration on the Terry Gilliam interview and the Tati short film.  They both appeared squished into widescreen format, when they should have been full screen.",1134864000,3,3104,4.290378006872852
7936239,4,B00005B1ZM,"Jacques Tatischeff changed his name to Jacques Tati in the 1920's when he worked in the French Music Halls. In the early 1950's, he began to develop a character that would ultimately become his alter-ego-Mr. Hulot. Tati sculpted Hulot from the toes up-an umbrella carrying, pipe smoking raincoat-clad funny hat-wearing Everyman in argyle socks. As he moved he defied gravity-almost off balance as he lurched about-yet graceful as a dancer.

PLAYTIME was the third in the Hulot series. He bankrupted himself shooting it in 70mm on a stretch of land he had to lease-constructing a whole city set-which came to be called Tativille. He wanted the polished chrome and glass look for all the buildings-and could not find them consistently in the real Paris. Tati took great artistic chances. Dialogue was incidental-almost feeling improvised. He shot it in all medium shots, mostly without specific dialogue-as a tip of the hat to Buster Keaton and silent films.  The zany action had to carry the plot-similar to the recent French Anime-THE TRIPLETS OF BELLVILLE (2003).

He postulated that the future would be a place of shiny surfaces and deadly conformity-just huge towers of ticky-tacky that would all look the same. He suggested that modern society is trying to delete or destroy all the vestiges and symbols of the past. In this film, one only sees the landmarks in Paris as reflections in great glass windows. The complex and long Royal Nightclub Scene became a masterwork of mayhem-choreographed precisely. We were bombarded with multiple sight gags that all happened rapidly-even simultaneously. Tati paved the way for directors Richard Lester and Robert Altman to handle crowd scenes effectively-brimming with overlapping action and humorous asides.

It took some energy to watch this film carefully. It could require multiple viewings to totally appreciate all that occurred within the frame. Tati completely reinvented comedy within silence-and made us love it. His routines ranged from broad slapstick to subtle bits of business with props and people. He taught us that there is a plethora of unintended humor surrounding us-if we would only pay attention to it-and take the trouble to allow ourselves to be touched and tickled by it.",1121817600,6,2241,5.199445983379501
7936240,4,B00005B1ZM,"I haven't reviewed a film on Amazon.com (or anywhere else, for that matter) in years, but I absolutely had to respond to the writer of the critique who issued the idea that ""Playtime isn't a comedy... would prefer a Coen Bros flick... etc.""

I'm as big a Coen Bros fan (sans the last few movies, of course) as anyone else, but to compare Tati to Joel and Ethan is downright nonsense, no matter if you're a film student, filmmaker, or miscellaneous! Derf!

PLAYTIME, much like the rest of Tati's oeuvre (especially the Hulot series) isn't so much about comedy (at least not the ha-ha-hehe comedy... if anything, it's a more subtle Keaton/Chaplin comedy-of-manners type of trip), as it is the magnificent SPECTACLE of his creation of a whole reality based largely in our own.

If anything, compare PLAYTIME not to a Coen Bros flick, but maybe Altman's NASHVILLE. What makes Tati's masterwork such an awe-inspiring experience for the senses is that he has developed and cultivated his very own Paris... and not the silly ""this is a movie"" dreamy, etherial romanticized Paris of AMELIE, but rather a more grounded-still-beatific-at-its-best Paris that could exist with the right set of eyes (as opposed to the right set of CGI, filters, etc.)

Yes, Tati used his own visual trickery and the like, but again, it was more of a playful jaunt in contrast to a simple click of a button.

This movie is amazing in that you are watching a reality constructed, almost as it seems, just for you (yes, YOU!!) It's a strange feeling, to be sure. And, yes, you might not be falling off your chair with laughter, but you smile and know that, ""Hey, that's pretty nifty.""

Then you kinda shut your mouth and gaze in a rather lackadaisical, halcyon fashion at the wonder of ""huh...""",1106092800,4,1762,4.741830065359477
7936241,5,B00005B1ZM,"This is the best example of Tati's experimental approach to humor. In fact it's sort of a cubist comedy with multiple layering of material and no discernible plot in any recognizable sense. Yet it works, it works well, and at no time will you feel it's aimless or merely episodic. Sounds a bit intellectual but this film is actually filled with endless great sight gags and some of the best slapstick you'll ever encounter. Keaton aside, this has two of the best ""falls"" in comedy. Also, the nightclub scene at the end is a masterpiece of timing and coordination. It reminds me of classic jazz improvisation. Like Keaton's ""The General"" this movie bombed when it was released but I'm betting it'll eventually be added to the list of great comedies of all time. Hopefully Criterion will re-release this soon and keep it in print.
Two caveats: I've noticed that people who expect comedies to be consistently manic and/or aren't accustomed to the slower pacing of many French films don't care much for this movie. It does require the focused attention of its audience to work. Also, the film was originally released in some oddball format that doesn't always translate effectively to the home screen. Because of this one major routine doesn't work quite as well as intended. It's not a major problem though.",1081814400,7,1304,4.852017937219731
