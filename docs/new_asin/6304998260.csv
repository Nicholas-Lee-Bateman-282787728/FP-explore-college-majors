944775,2,6304998260,"This movie could have been awarded five stars because Charlie Sheen was in it. However, two stars were given in the interest of fairness.
Charlie's performance was dragged down by a lacklustre supporting cast and a plot which was mildly interesting at best.
I loved the scenery though and the fact that Charlie got to drive around Scotland in a hot car (was it a black Lamborghini?)
My review, however, may not be worth the paper it was not written on because I would happily pay good money to watch Charlie Sheen recite the alphabet.",1323043200,,534,4.631578947368421
944776,4,6304998260,Despite his recent rantings I remain a Charlie Sheen fan.  His performance in this almost-noir film is very good and the direction is excellent.  Seller got this VHS tape to me quickly.,1306713600,,185,4.75
944777,2,6304998260,"I have no clue as to why I watched this movie...I had already seen a movie from this director (Demon Slaughter) and that movie was as bad or worse than this one; the same exact production values, bad acting, bad dialogue etc. I wasn't surprised to see this movie stink as much as it did, I was expecting it. For starters this movie can be found in your local dollar store or in a box set of crappy movies. I found mine in the box set of 50 movie pack ""Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares""

Now, what exactly should we expect from this movie? Uhm...Let's see, garbage perhaps? Nothing in this movie stands as good quality, from the bad acting to the cheap unoriginal twist ending. The premise of the supposed movie is of an acclaimed Author, he has written a book called ""Serial Killer"" (how original) somehow murderers and rapist are copying the book...even if the idea isn't original it could have been a descent movie...But no, instead we get irrelevant torture porn scenes, nasty gory sequences, and sickening dialogue...it goes on and on until the closing shot. Avoid this movie at all costs, don't listen to the top reviewer who said this movie has a good twist, it really doesn't, and it has been used in much better movies.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 1  OUT OF 5",1235865600,,1256,4.524229074889868
944778,3,6304998260,A low budget movie with a lot of nudity and very creepy characaters.  The movie does have a cool little twist at the end.  Check it out...,1208476800,,138,4.074074074074074
944779,3,6304998260,"POSTMORTEM is one of those psychological thrillers that bends the plot lines and incorporates confusing motivations in order to forward its plot.  While it doesn't quite come up to par, it is a tidy little thriller with an interesting performance from Stephen McCole, who plays the necromancer and obvious fan of writer Charlie Sheen's book on serial killers.  Sheen himself is a suspect at first as the killer is sending him advance fax notices of the deaths, and a body is found in Sheen's garden.  Charlie plays a down and out, alcoholic former cop who left the States to wind up in Scotland, where the movie takes place.  Sheen sobers up to help the local law officials track down this criminal.  Sheen does an okay job as Jimmy McGregor, although he seems disoriented at times when he shouldn't.  The role of McCole's sister in the plot is never fully explained, nor is the father's, but that's part of the psychological ambiguity parlayed in this film.  It does have a touching rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" at the end, but we still don't know what kind of future Sheen will have.  Not totally satisfying, but not a bad movie either.  Just average.",1096761600,2,1153,4.725
944780,1,6304998260,"To my knowledge, Albert Pyun has a record of doing bad movie: Crazy Six, Adrenalin Fear The Rush, Cyborg and many others, though Mean Guns is his best work. Here he does another crappy job with who, you might say..Charlie Sheen (Tv's Spin City, The Big Bounce) of all people. Sheen plays a was been cop who got divorced and he has a booze problem. He also has written a book on about serial killers. Things don't happen until the cops find the first body in the garden and it seems interesting but the mind decieves and it turns out to be a pile of waste. The Killer is a necrophiliac and likes to lay with the bodies and so forth....wow, I think. Sheen drops his booze binges and helps out the cops. Wall to wall stupidity. Very predictable. The end where Sheen is running after the guy is hilarious. They both seem to run like Steven Seagal or something. Also starring Ivana Milicevic (I think she is a model of some sort) and Michael Halsey (Mean Guns, Tv's Angel).",1094083200,,968,4.383333333333334
944781,5,6304998260,"The story could have been written by Stephen King:  Psychologically down because of the emotional stress of his job ex-investigator and bestseller  author James MacGregor (Charles Sheen) moves from America to the Scottish  Highlands. But instead getting some peace to sort out his life he becomes  the target of an serial killer who sends him faxes to announce upcoming  murders. A dead girl found in his garden makes him the local police's No. 1  suspect. This means back to work for MacGregor to find the true killer.  Charles Sheen's performance is absolutely brilliant, another proof of his  wide spread talents as an actor. Seems he easily plays every role, no  matter if it's comedy or serious material.",966470400,7,709,4.9914529914529915
944782,4,6304998260,"Good comeback role for Sheen. About a messed up kid who has an inkling towards dead women,and the Scottish investigators and washed out American detective/writer who tracks him down. Plays like a fast-paced episode of  ""The Bill"" and lots of morbid connotation. Overall while lacking  the original touch present in crime movies these days,it still has a slight  edge over it American counter parts.",954979200,5,398,5.1875

7880150,4,6304998260,"This is a low budget but well acted police procedural. Charlie Sheen plays American James MacGregor, a former detective who has seen too much horror in his work. He is now in Scotland (his grandmother was from Glasgow). A book he wrote about his cases has piqued the interest of a serial killer, who sends him FAXes.
The usual fussing around with local police thinking he did it, then yelling back & forth until he is accepted as ""one of us."" The actors all do a good job, especially Sheen & one of my favorite actors--Gary Lewis (Gangs of New York & many other films/tv shows). I won't do any spoilers but there is a satisfying conclusion. So many films today do Not have conclusions that make sense, so you won't be disappointed here.
An added bonus for me, I've been to Scotland for 2 three week archaeological visits. I absolutely LOVE Scotland, miss the accents, scenery & the people. Enjoyed this film.",1480204800,,908,4.576687116564417
