4271270,4,B0046ZRHAG,"This nicely made, fan loving doc-short is recommended for those who have never attended a horror con before. It will certainly make them enthusiastic to join in the fun. Director Stever does a nice job highlighting the beauty of the theatre where this event took place (one cool moment involves F13 The Series' Robey wailing into the void of the lobby below), as well. Fans of Adrienne Barbeau and the Romero clan may want to check this out, too. John Amplas gives a rare interview and while the Barbeau footage is brief, it is always nice to see this gracious (still gorgeous) genre superstar.",1358553600,,594,4.721153846153846
4271271,4,B0046ZRHAG,"Michael Stevers' documentary is a solid look at the behind-the-scenes workings of a horror convention.  For anyone who's been curious about how things come together for a con, or how the celebrities feel about meeting their fans, the doc answers those questions.  What goes into making a con is intriguing, as are the interviews Stevers does, including one with Adrienne Barbeau;  getting the opinions of some celebrities alone makes the doc worth watching.

If you've attended conventions this doc will interest you.  If you haven't, and you love horror, it'll surely inspire you to check one out.",1358380800,,598,5.123711340206185
4271272,5,B0046ZRHAG,"Don't believe the nay sayers here folks. This documentary short rocks! Filmmaker Stever may not have come to the table with a million dollar budget but what he does bring are a sharp eye, a steady hand and a true love for the horror genre and all the guests in attendance! He also scours the catacombs & seldom seen areas of the legendary Landmark Movie Palace which made for a fascinating, creepy backdrop in its own right.",1358380800,,424,4.51948051948052
4271273,1,B0046ZRHAG,"Do not waste your money on this. First the disc wouldn't play on any device I put it in. But that happens, and I did quickly and easily return it;. The video itself was horribly made. I was only interested in seeing what became of Robey from Friday the 13th: The Series. Otherwise this was a complete waste of money.",1358208000,,316,4.283333333333333
4271274,3,B0046ZRHAG,"I will buy just about anything related to George A. Romero, if you share this compulsion you may want to add this to your collection.  If you are expecting Document of the Dead quality and insight you will be greatly disappointed.  Running time is very short under an hour, most of which is poorly video taped filler of fans congregating around the booths in the lobby and either an edited or extremely brief panel discussion featuring George, Joe Pilato and long time collaborator Tom Savini.  I cant stress the amateur quality of this Expo DVD, almost anyone in attendance with an iPhone documenting their experience would have been just as good.  Not to say it is without certain gems, a brief interview with John Amplas and for what ever reason, several Pilato, Savini encounters that for whatever reason prompted a less than cordial reaction from Savini.  If you never get enough of Romero, Amplas, Savini and Pilato, there is just enough material contained in this DVD to justify a viewing.",1355356800,,996,4.8352941176470585
8417558,5,B0046ZRHAG,A surprisingly entertaining film about a horror expo. Romero and zombie fans should watch!,1528761600,,90,5.5
8417559,5,B0046ZRHAG,"See this beautiful and haunting theatre through the eyes of film maker Michael Stever.  Informative and entertaining, a must see for horror movie fans who appreciate learning the history of this historical venue.",1527033600,,212,5.424242424242424
8417560,5,B0046ZRHAG,I really loved this. Such a fun film for horror/Romero fans!!!,1527033600,,62,4.7272727272727275
8417561,5,B0046ZRHAG,"Very enjoyable, a must for every fan of horror films of the '60s onward. Now that George A. Romero has gone up to that big projection room in the sky it's great to be able to hear and see him take questions from fans and talk about making the 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead,"" which I had the good fortune to see one midnight in San Francisco before it was unleashed on the public and word got around that it changed filmmaking forever. Adrienne Barbeau is as charming as ever and quite candid in her interview. The fans are a hoot, and ""Saturday Nightmares"" captures the wacky spirit of enthusiasts who take their fun seriously enough to group up to worship masters like Romero and his merry crew members. As well as dress up like zombies to cavort around and crowd the stage of a magnificent, mammoth old movie palace that movie lovers like me would move into and live in if we could. Director Michael Lee Stever makes the most of the material. Warm, wonderful, wacky stuff!",1526947200,,975,4.4525139664804465
8417562,5,B0046ZRHAG,"A fascinating behind-the-scenes look at a 2010 Saturday Nightmares horror expo.  It's worth viewing just for the interior and layout of the Loew's Theater, an astounding location for an event of this type, but there is also the added benefit of stories from George Romero, Adrienne Barbeau and others from the horror movie industry.  Michael Stever is an engaging host and interviewer for this well-done documentary.",1526860800,,416,5.287878787878788
8417563,1,B0046ZRHAG,I loveGeorge Romero  don't get me wrong  this is not worth the money plain and simple some homemade junk (not even made by Romero  but  just awful awful awful basically a retrospect or filming of a come-on type event in some nasty grungy (and not in a good way) theater i can't smell the stink of the venue  through the film...,1523577600,,327,4.295081967213115
8417564,1,B0046ZRHAG,"While I know that this was an astounding location for a new Horror Convention, the filling showcases numerous actors and George Romeo, even billing it as a panel discussion. I snatched this up, being a huge Romero fanatic, and settled in to watch the panel discussion. Sadly, the vast majority of the film is about the convention and shows only brief clips or short responses to questions! Ken Foree's rant is about 2 minutes long and at no point addresses his role in any film! Romero has a few stories but never gets to talk about his film. For me, it was a total waste of my money. I am more disappointed in this purchase than anything else I have bought.",1392508800,,658,4.446280991735537
8417565,5,B0046ZRHAG,"Whether you grew up with this Loews theater a familiar local landmark or you're a fan of horror and genre cinema, you'll get a kick out of SATURDAY NIGHTMARES: THE ULTIMATE HORROR EXPO. Focusing on a horror fan convention held at the theater, the film provides a tour of the theater's amazing architecture and coverage of the convention attendees and the movies they love. Plus, an interview with Adrienne Barbeau! It's all presented with obvious affection by the filmmaker. A fun tribute to this Hollywood niche.",1361750400,,513,4.976744186046512
8417566,5,B0046ZRHAG,"Filmmaker Michael Stever takes us inside the glorious Landmark Loew's Jersey Theatre for the 2010 Saturday Nightmares horror expo, and what a treat it is. With that atmospheric setting as the perfect backdrop, Stever gives us a front row seat to the preparation and goings-on at a convention unlike any other. A panel discussion with director George A. Romero and cast and crew of DAWN OF THE DEAD, as well as interviews with the lovely Adrienne Barbeau and actor John Amplas, are just some of the highlights on this fun DVD.

Insightful and funny, it would be a terrific addition to any horror fan's collection. Highly recommended.",1359763200,2,632,4.906542056074766
8417567,3,B0046ZRHAG,"Michael Lee Stever's SATURDAY NIGHTMARES is a fun look at a horror convention from the perspective of an amateur filmmaker on a shoe-string budget whom has a pure love for the genre. With various clips of panels, interviews, and insightful commentary by various alumni in the horror biz, it makes for a nice companion piece to any horror geek's collection. The ""documentary"" runs just under an hour, but serves more as a promo-piece for the Jersey City, NJ convention.

Highlights are Joe Pilato (DAY OF THE DEAD) running around like a madman roaring lines of dialogue that his character Rhodes spewed out with venomous effectiveness in the film. Oh, and remember actress Louise Robey from FRIDAY THE 13TH the series in 1987???? Of course you don't, but I loved that show and always wondered what she was doing. Viewers get a chance to see her in one of the most bizarre scenes on camera as she ""talks"" to ghosts and spirits in the 100 years plus old movie theater. Throw in some cool interviews with Adrienne Barbeau, Roy Frumkes, and some panel footage with George A. Romero and Ken Foree, and one has some interesting viewing.

It's worth a look.",1359331200,2,1149,4.74
