I felt ripped-off. Wonderful artists,but miserable background sound. Who; that gave 5 stars; maybe they are deaf or were the dvd promoters.",1245715200,,311,5.0
8167707,5,B000MC7PEA,"This special was great! There are a lot of classic hits here, and it's great to see them performed by the orginal groups! I'm a BIG fan of Tony Orlando and Dawn, so I loved seeig them reunite on this special. They are the best! I give this DVD an A+.",1222473600,,250,3.9215686274509802
8167708,4,B000MC7PEA,"This DVD is part of a PBS concert special that evidently was filmed on two consecutive days.  The first volume is the concert as it aired on PBS, and this volume contains more performances by five of the artists that appeared on volume 1.  The production values are excellent and the DVD is indexed so you can go to any particular song you wish, although I personally found some of Tony Orlando's performances somewhat less that inspiring.  Still, if you enjoy this kind of music or are part of that generation, this DVD is definitely worth owning.
