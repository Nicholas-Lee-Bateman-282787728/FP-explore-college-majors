And even then, board games by yourself are berter.",1405123200,,191,4.647058823529412
8138500,4,B000HC2ODW,"I enjoyed this comedy drama & found it to be interesting on the whole. I would say that some of the scenes did not seem to gel completly as much as they could, but having watched it twice now I would say it's one of the better light hearted movies that i've watched this year.",1247097600,,276,4.036363636363636
8138501,2,B000HC2ODW,"Not very good in any respect. Just half-hearted acting, writing, producing and music.  The ending is predictable but I felt like they just looked for a spot to end the flick and used it.  Don't bother buying this one.

They never did come out with a sound track since I heard John Oates had a song on it called ""You Can't Get There From Here"".",1215820800,,343,4.246153846153846
