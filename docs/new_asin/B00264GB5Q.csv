8351896,5,B00264GB5Q,"Ok I am British and I loved this series when I first saw some of them in the UK and have been looking forward to its release on DVD for a long time so that I could see all of them. I was not disappointed. It was still as funny as I remembered it. The humour is quintessentially British and still very fresh after all these years.  The series brings back memories of the innocence of England that I think has been lost.
The team of comic actors create characters that are really funny yet believable.  Even though each episode stands alone, there is a storyline that connects each of them - a love triangle and the fear that their branch line will be closed by Mr Beeching.",1328918400,,672,4.2421875
8351897,5,B00264GB5Q,"I highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates good English comedy!!!

If you are looking for coarse entertainment...this isn't it!  This is a clever, entertaining sitcom, unlike the products that are produced today.

Su Pollard is hilarous...worth the price of the ticket!",1325548800,,283,5.534883720930233
8351898,5,B00264GB5Q,"This gem of a series is from David Croft, who is also responsible for ""Dad's Army"" and ""Are You Being Served?"".

In 1963, Dr. Beeching was given the job of closing little-used branches of British Railways.  At that time the greatest challenge of rail travel went from getting a decent cup of tea to finding a station that hadn't been closed.  The series revolves around the escapades of British Rail employees at the tiny station of Hadley.  Hadley is a prime candidate for closure and a real challenge for the new station manager, Cecil Parkin, played by Jeffrey Holland.

Turns out that Parkin once had a brief affair with May Skinner (Julia Deakin), who runs the coffee shop and is now married to porter Jack Skinner (Paul Shane).  Old feelings rise again and Cecil and May must work hard to keep their past hidden.  Hilarious complications ensue.  My personal favorite episode is the one where Jack plots to kill Cecil in a variety of comical ways.  The excellent cast is rounded out by Sue Pollard and Stephen Lewis (Smiler on ""Last of the Summer Wine"").

These four disks contain all nineteen episodes of the series.  The pilot epidode is not included in this set, thus the ""complete"" series is complete minus one.

PLEASE NOTE:  THESE ARE REGION 2 PAL DISKS WHICH REQUIRE A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC.",1302652800,,1357,4.6991525423728815
