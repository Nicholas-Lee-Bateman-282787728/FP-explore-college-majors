7979451,2,B000087F52,"The women in this are beautiful, with well-sculpted bodies and the stories SHOULD be interesting, but there doesn't seem to be any spark here.  There is no chemistry between the partners, and no sense of any real emotion or drama.  Everybody is simply miming, and the sex scenes carry with them no sense of reality or involvment.  It's almost like watching very high-quality computer generated images, instead of real people with real feelings for and about each other.
It's worth seeing once, if only to enjoy Tane McClure and Kim Yates in the buff, but it's not something for the long-term collection. :(",1052784000,3,606,4.864077669902913
