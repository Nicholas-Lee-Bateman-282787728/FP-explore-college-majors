7823805,3,6302296021,"It does not take any religious affiliation to appreciate this reasonably factual tale on the life of Esther, a courageous young Jewish teenage woman who became Queen of Medio-Persia. You are led through the Esther Story with make-believe teen characters Margo and Derrick. This movie and all of the videos in the Greatest Adventure Series are consistently a part of my family time with my pre-school grandson to my teen daughter. 'Esther' is a wonderful teaching tool that particularly demonstrates; decision making skills, community responsibility, and consequences to unethical behavior. Along with his Heroes, Esther has given my grandson another Sheroe. If viewed without adult supervision this 30 minute movie will better serve eight year olds plus.",973814400,9,754,5.452991452991453
