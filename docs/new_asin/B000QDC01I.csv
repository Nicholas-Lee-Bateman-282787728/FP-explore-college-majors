8195742,5,B000QDC01I,"This is a Vatican Television DVD release that features documentary footage of major events in John Paul II's life and papacy. The Vatican Television Center has released several wonderful DVDs in this vein. Despite some cheesy music and exaggerated English narration/dubbing, this particular disc discusses his early life and includes every iconic image of his papacy -- from videos of papal visits to 1983 footage of him visiting his would-be assassin in prison -- that one could ever ask for in one place. It also includes an invaluable bonus track featuring 7 minutes of footage from his last hospital visit to the announcement of his death in St. Peter's Square and the largest public funeral in history. The best thing about this DVD is that it simply reports the events of JPII's life and allows the footage itself to tell the story: There are no attempts at political ""spin"" or cheap sensationalism as one finds in major media documentaries on this pope. As you watch the major events of JPII's life unfold more or less chronologically, his deep humanity and love of mankind emerges very powerfully, and it is hard not to cry in certain spots. This is the sort of heroic life that our society should celebrate, instead of the pop culture icons who distract us from what really matters in life.",1347408000,,1299,4.829596412556054

Pope John Paul II was an apostle for peace, human rights and, most of all , human dignity .He wiil be remembered along great figures like mother Teresa, Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. If we had more people like him in the high spheres of power the world would be a much beter place to live in today.",1170201600,4,478,4.085106382978723
