VHS ..or seen at the cinema. Christopher Lee,per usual is brilliant add-in John Steed (reference for Avengers fans)as Dr. Watson and you have a great cast...For all the viewers who couldn't sit still...blame yourself..not the movie..with a little patience one day you might even read a ""Sherlock Holmes"" book.............
all the way through...",1252800000,11,645,4.972222222222222
509595,3,6302776929,"This TV movie -wholly shot in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg -is not based on a Conan Doyle story but instead is an original screenplay -although it does feature the character of Irene Adler ,""THE woman"" in Holmes' eyes .Holmes goes to Vienna at the behest of his brother Mycroft ,to trace and recover a missing detonation device which the British government wish to prevent falling into the wrong hands -that is ,either the Russians or Germans .There he once more meets up with Irene Adler who is performing in Die Fleidermaus at the Vienna Opera House ,and the attraction between the two is rekindled .Holmes is not the only one after the device -there are Russian and German agents as well as a group of Bosnian rebels who seek to use the device to kill the Austrain Emperor ,and thus trigger revolt in their nation .

Also stirred into the mix is Siegmund Freud ,who astes no time in psychoanalysing Holmes and a young US agent ,Eliot Ness ,here depicted as an enthusiastic but bungling neophyte .Things eventually climax in a confrontation at the opera house ,which cannot help but evoke echoes of The Phantom of the Opera .

There are some good things in the movie. Christopher Lee is ideally cast as Holmes ,bringing gravitas and dignity to the role .He is especially touching when acknowledging his fears that age has resulted in a diminution of his powers and his attraction to Adler is well conveyed .The scene where Holmes acknowledges his inability to form relationsships is touching and movingly played .Patrick McNee makes an adequate Watson and the movie is well mounted and adequately acted .

The major problem is length -it simply goes on too long and some judicious trimming ,losing ,say ,30 minutes ,would have made it sharper and more impactful

Worth watching ,if only for Lee's performance",1181088000,17,1811,4.776357827476039
509596,1,6302776929,"Always looking for a good mystery and anything Sherlockian, I recently ran across the two made-for-UK-TV Christopher Lee as Sherlock Holmes movies. I rather enjoyed the other, ""incident at Victoria Falls,"" but found this one truly egregious in almost every aspect.

Mom said to say nice things first so here goes:

Strong Points: Christopher Lee is a magnificent Holmes, ever bit the equal to Jeremy Brett, and a better actor in general. He looks and lives the role and his facial nuances are fantastic. Alas that it would take more than his fine performance to make the film.

Bad spots:

Patrick MacNee is a fine actor but the script makes him into an inconsistent Watson- at times quite competent, at others a bungler.

Plot: The basic plot is alright- centering in a non-canonical tale set in 1910 when an about-to-retire Holmes is badgered by his brother into traveling to Vienna to investigate the theft of a remote bomb detonator. Espionage, the premier of Die Fliedermaus, and an attempt on the Austrian Emperor are woven in.

Unfortunately, at 193 minutes, the film is at least an hour too long and drags accordingly. There are too many historic toss-ins, such as a sub-plot with Freud (horribly played with no resemblance to the real behavior of the historic father of Psychoanalysis). A few other surprises ring false, as do casting Morgan Fairchild as an *American* Irene Adler and ridiculously putting in Engelbert Humperdinck as the leading man in Die Fliedermaus.

And now the real reason not to buy the DVD: Unless you like spaghetti westerns where the lips and soundtrack don't match, you won't want to watch this. Bad sound just ruins the whole thing!",1180569600,15,1669,4.897163120567376
509597,2,6302776929,"Bob Shayne (the writer) panned his own movie, which should give you an idea of just how terrible the (very badly edited) version is. By his own account, the script was changed in several critical places which messed up the plot and an actor with a key supporting role literally walked out in the middle of the production.  And _then_ some geniuses decided to cut over a third of the movie out for home-video release.  Result; a Wood-style (as in Ed Wood, Jr.) slumgullion.  On the other hand, the movie has just been released to DVD in its full-length version along with its companion piece (""Incident at Victoria Falls""); I bought it last weekend and, while still not terrific, the movie/miniseries is now at least coherent.

I like Morgan Fairchild and think she did OK as Irene Adler (she looks terrific in Edwardian costume), but it's the outstanding Christopher Lee and Patrick Macnee (neither of whom need any introduction) who make even the edited version endurable as Holmes and Watson.  Even all the other reviews that've panned this movie have good things to say about the Lee/Macnee team!",1176249600,2,1099,4.824468085106383
509598,1,6302776929,"If you're like me, and love seeing new or new-to-you Sherlock Holmes movies, please do not be conned into viewing this one; it's a real spirit-breaker.
Even at two hours, the film is an hour too long, and yet it still feels like it takes five hours to watch. As the previous reviewer commented, the editing down of the four hour mini-series is atrocious, ham-fisted, and done with no skill whatsoever. This results in huge gaps in the story that make no sense when the characters refer to a previous event that wound up on the cutting room floor.
There are few if any examples of Holmes' methods, and even Lee seems tired and bored with the proceedings. Patrick Macnee serves as an okay Watson, but he too seems bored with the whole thing. Morgan ""Old Navy Chick"" Fairchild ranges from alright to downright hammy as Irene Adler, and one wonders why such a young-ish babe would be hot for the grandfatherly-by-comparison Lee. Engelbert Humperdinck seems in search of ""The Love Boat"", the show he probably thought he was going to be guest starring on when he found himself in this insult to Sherlockia instead.
And as for the mystery, you simply will not care who did what or why because the movie will cast you into a somnambulic state long before the first twenty minutes elapse. If by some miracle your brain can struggle out of this movie-induced torpor for but a moment, all you can think of to say is, ""End, movie! END!"" Purgatory could not last any longer than this movie, unless in Purgatory they make you watch this movie twice.
A certain professor of mathematics, known to the followers of the world famous consulting detective, must surely have been at work here in an evil attempt to denegrate the hallowed name of Sherlock Holmes!
Avoid like Richenbach Falls!",1046217600,7,1770,4.676282051282051
7830906,3,6302776929,"It was an alright series, if a bit sillier than I was expecting. They should add some sort of seizure warning though.

7830907,2,6302776929,"Having Sigmund Freud - rather Sigmund the Fraud - that so much of Western Psychobabble and claptrap is based on as  a prominent character in this drama was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary and did nothing but detract.  That, combined with poor early 1980's American- style TV writing and mediocre directing, wasted the acting talent of this outstanding cast.",1517529600,,363,5.241379310344827

7830909,1,6302776929,The writing was awful. The acting was phoned in (and a bad connection.) The directing was amateurish. Other than that it was generally terrible for the half hour I was able to tolerate.,1513814400,,185,4.636363636363637

7830911,5,6302776929,I love this movie. It was nice to see the whole story on DVD that filled in the gaps left in the VHS version. I enjoyed the espionage element in the plot. The production is beautiful. I loved Lee and Fairchild as Holmes and Irene. Their December romance is touching and called out for a sequel.,1465516800,,294,4.267857142857143

7830914,2,6302776929,i love morgan fairchild - she is still gorgeous today but this movie was just plain boring.  i could not bring myself to spend a couple of hrs watching it and simply put it off.  the only reason i am keeping it in my collection is because morgan fairchild plays in it.,1357776000,,268,4.134615384615385
7830915,3,6302776929,"There are several major problems with this production, the worst being the excessive running time.  It could easily have taken place in two hours instead of nearly four.  On top of that, Holmes was only supposed to be a few years older than Irene Adler, certainly not old enough to be her father.  As for Morgan Fairchild's Adler, the best that can be said is she gave a better performance than Engelbert Humperdinck, who didn't belong here at all and seemed to know it.  The actors playing Freud and Ness were simply awful.  No better was the thin fellow playing Mycroft, who was supposed to be seven years older than Holmes.
The plot is okay, Holmes seeking a remote control bomb stolen by anarchists and running into his old nemesis Adler in the course of events.
The best thing about the film is the teaming of Christopher Lee and Patrick Macnee in the leads.  Though this time Macnee's Watson did bungle through parts, he comes through in the end.  Lee's Holmes had the nice touch of worrying he was getting old and losing his powers.  Good old Watson strongly disputes this.
Not the best Holmes film, but better than ""The Deadly Necklace"".",1264550400,3,1145,4.633663366336633
