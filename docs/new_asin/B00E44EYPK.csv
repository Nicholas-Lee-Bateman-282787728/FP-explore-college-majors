8600822,3,B00E44EYPK,"Three Faces East is a 1930 spy drama from Warner Bros., based on a 1918 Broadway play about World War 1. It was first made as a silent film in 1926, and then re-made in 1940 with Boris Karloff (British Intelligence).  It was one of many films made in the 30s that focused on the treachery of the Germans in World War 1, offering a warning about the impending growth of the Nazi movement.

Constance Bennett (1904-65) started in the silent era and made 50+ films between 1916 and 1966. Shes best known for her work in comedies (Topper). She is the sister of Joan Bennett and Barbara Bennett. Bennett plays a German agent who goes to live with the head of the British Admiralty (curiously called Winston Chamberlain)

Erich von Stroheim (1885-1957) plays a Nazi spy who works with Bennett. Von Stroheim was a famous German silent film director (Greed, The Merry Widow, The Lost Squadron), but he got into too many arguments when the talkie era started, and he turned to acting. He had plenty of experience playing the evil German soldier in the silent era (The Hun Within, The Heart of Humanity) so he transitioned easily into his role for this film. Von Stroheim is perhaps best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as the film director Max Von Mayerling in Sunset Blvd (1950). IMO this is one of his weakest performances.

The film is directed by Roy Del Ruth (1893-1961), a former gagman for Mack Sennett who made more than 100 films between 1920 and 1960. He was best known for his musical comedies (""Born to Dance"", Ziegfeld Follies"") and dramas (""Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back""), although his most popular films was the William Bendix ""The Babe Ruth Story"" (1948).

In 1930 the top grossing films were All Quiet on the Western Front, Eddie Cantors Whoopee, Hells Angels, Animal Crackers, and Harold Lloyds Feet First. All Quiet was the big Oscar winner (Picture, Director). Other notable films released that year include Disraeli (George Arliss won the Oscar), The Divorce (Norma Shearer won the Oscar), Garbos Anna Christie, Wallace Beerys Big House and Min and Bill, John Waynes massive failure The Big Trail, and Howard Hawks Dawn Patrol. Many of these films had better production values and more modern camera use than the current film.

The New York Times called von Stroheim splendid and Bennett particularly good. They said Roy Del Ruth is to be congratulated on the direction of this film, for he delivers his surprises with an agreeable finesse.

The film shows its heritage from the silent era. There are sequences of 30 seconds or more that are completely silent, with not even musical background. Though not noticeable at that time, they are glaring when viewed decades later. There are some continuity problems too. Von Stroheim is presented in the first scene as a Belgian soldier receiving a medal from the French, and then shortly later we find out he is a butler at the British Admiralty home where he has been for some years. Its also a bid melodramatic, which is also a hangover from the silent era as well as its beginnings as a stage play.

These criticisms aside, the film is nonetheless entertaining and after all these years it still holds the viewers interest. Is Bennett a spy or a double spy? Is von Stroheim a spy or a double spy? Will the love story impact the spy story?",1443916800,,3307,4.729166666666667
