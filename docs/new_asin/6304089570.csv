789334,5,6304089570,"My nephew (just shy of three years old at this writing) loves this, and I love watching it with him.  Disney wisely followed up the original with two more Silly Symphonies featuring the same cast, included here.  As for the ""violence"", I've heard that blather for as long as can be recalled and obviously some folks are hypersensitive.  Cartoons require a suspension of disbelief; talking animals alone should be enough to clue in the average person that the situation they're seeing isn't real.  Most kids are smart enough to know that.  This is from 1933 and is totally harmless.  If anything, the moral of the film is hard work and practicality, and the pig that works the hardest ascends to the status of leader...that's the way life works (or should) and its good for kids to see that so clearly portrayed. So what if the Big Bad Wolf gets bopped around a bit.  We should teach children that bad things happen to bad folks. He's evil and deserves it for being the Bin Laden of the enchanted forest! So what if Grandma gets chased.  In some versions of Red Riding Hood, she's INGESTED!  This is pure fun and perfectly acceptable for all ages without a disclaimer.  Jeez Moms...loosen up, will ya! Not everything has to be sticky-sweet like Barney.",1008633600,12,1251,4.671232876712328
789335,4,6304089570,"As an adult I enjoyed watching this video with my three-year-old daughter; she loves to watch this video over and over and laugh and giggle.  We both found many parts of the video funny and laughed together, however some parts frightened her as there is a bit too much violence at the end of the video.  In some cases I feel kids can get ""ideas"" put into their heads from watching the video; there is one part where the kid wolves are chasing the pigs with meat knives.  If you get this video and have very young kids, sit with them for the first 4-5 times the video is played and explain to them that it is just a cartoon or make-believe.",1001721600,5,639,4.221311475409836
