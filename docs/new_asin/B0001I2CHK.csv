2003704,4,B0001I2CHK,"I rented this one because of Dominique Swain, I kept watching it because of Dominique Swain, but I ended up enjoying it because of the 2nd half of the movie.  What starts off as a ""burning bed"" flick set in the Louisiana swamps ends up as a compelling drama in which three main characters undergo a life-changing transformation.  Swain fans may be disappointed that she spends the entire film covered in grime & most of it wearing an eye patch.  Once the abusive husband issue is resolved halfway through, the movie really comes into its own.  The ending is very satisfying as the two main characters realize that they are irresistibly connected in a most profound way.  Director Zev Berman does a great job.",1123804800,107,708,4.67741935483871
2003705,2,B0001I2CHK,"Did you notice that most of the people reviewing this and giving it a good review are hicks? Maybe if you live in a one horse town and this is the only movie to rent, then you might see it as a 5 star jem like some of these other alcoholics did. I don't get it. I think the acting was terrible. A bunch of hillbillies that could not act. The writing is absolutely atrocious. Let me elaborate: many, MANY times in the movie you will find your self saying ""Why didn't she do `this' or do `that"" or ""Oh come on, no one would do that."" Its just to unrealistic, to the point its ridiculous. Here is the girl getting the crap beat out of her, and she has several opportunities to bash husband, and turn the tables on him. She has so many opportunities to get back at him, and to even lock him away in jail. So we have the ""Im just a victim, beat the crap out of me"" main character. The story gets more ridiculous as the girl start to form a relation ship with a man she is physically repulsed by, instead of the guy she originally had the hots for. Finally, it was boring! It's a half hour movie at best dragged out into a full length movie. SO, all you `billy bobs' out there, feel free to grab a copy of this garbage and take your shots of JD and enjoy. To everyone else, if your looking for a half way decent domestic violence movie, I would stay with movies like `Enough' and `Sleeping with the enemy' or just go rent some old Fara Foset movies. She always liked getting the crap kicked out of her. I gave it an extra star, because, there is actually worse movies.",1112486400,9,1562,4.107843137254902
2003706,4,B0001I2CHK,"Even if you start watching in the middle of this film, you simply cannot stop watching.  It is completly captivating.

The music, the characters, the story all combine to take

you away until the credits roll.  The people in the swamp

seem to be timeless, and indeed who knows what year this

film takes place? Henry Thomas is a cruel loser, as he played

to a small degree in All The Pretty Horses.  But the rest of

the cast are all redeemable characters, no matter what they

This movie was 101 minutes of my life I won't ever regret. As mentioned previously this movie is a modern day Macbeth w/ a touch of ""hick"" to it.

What's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain's character. Swain's Character is a hillbilly who like's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with, I never really got why Swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie.

Them that expects the usual Cinemax late night smut and neon misogyny will be I'm happy to say disappointed. This is a brave, interesting, beautiful movie, in which the most sypmathetic character is a creepy redneck named Flowers who likes to sniff Domique Swain's sandals. Little Elliot from E.T. is all grown up and give us what is perhaps the best, most complex, even sympathetic portrait of an angry, wife-beating loser. You Swain-hunds won't even get real nudity so go check yourselves (her cut off jeans aren't half as short as Daisy Duke's), this be art and love lovers swamp territory all the way.

2003742,5,B0001I2CHK,"This movie was originally titled ""Plain Dirty"", and that title fits it better than the present one.  It is a strange little film which I happened upon years ago, and I  never really forgot.  It addresses the beguiling notion of the ""true lover"", and for me the rest of the story line plays a distant second.
Set in rural Virginia, the story features a deeply earthy Inez encumbered with an abusive husband.  He is only one of the three men obsessed with her.  He is a character of primitive presentation that speaks in a mysteriously erudite form.  While this should annoy me, it really tickles me for some reason.  His best friend, ""Flowers is as back woods as is possible but appreciates opera, speaks poetically, and loves Inez in a deeply satisfying grounded way.  Meanwhile, Inez believes that the rich but ungrounded town man is her fate.  He is bewitched by her connection to the world.
The resolution of this story is not particularly subtle or new.  But for some reason it has stayed with me for years until I found it again here.  It has a niche in my head and I think it can bewitch.",1417651200,3,1094,4.50253807106599

She wants liberation from an abusive, stupid criminal and so comes up with a scheme.  Add to the mix an even worse idiot - a lustful sidekick primitive even dumber and more dangerous than her husband - and you have all the elements of an excellent film noir.  You can also answer the questions, ""what happened to that adorable kid in ET?"" and ""what about that latest Lolita?""

The acting in this is excellent, the girl just the right mix of sexiness and sleaze, and the action as believable as the characters.  Warmly recommended.",1320537600,3,705,4.645161290322581

Young Inez is married to an abusive, pot growing husband (played by Henry Thomas). She longs to escape from this marriage and be with a wealthy man on the other side town.  They are in love and want to be together.  She hatches a plan to get rid of him.

2003820,5,B0001I2CHK,"This movie is pure poetry: it rips through all stereotypes of poor Southern folks to bring us complex people with unsatisfied longings and iron-strong wills. The things the characters say are continually surprising, metaphoric and profound: it's a bit like Shakespeare in a swamp.

2003822,3,B0001I2CHK,"I sat through the entire movie, and while I did enjoy it I couldn't shake the aversion to all of the dirt. Everybody lived in absolute squalor except for the so-called ""rich"" folks. I have been around my share of country people and for the most part they have been clean and orderly folks. Contrast that to the characters in this flick who live in the most sickening of environments with dirt everywhere, dishes that appear to have never been washed, bugs crawling all over the kitchen...yechhhhh!!! Even the people themselves stayed covered in dirt for the whole movie. Real people don't live that way. The plot is good, the acting okay, and the ending pretty well fits with the storyline, so I can't give it fewer than three stars. Give the cast a bath and put them in more normal surroundings and it would be worth four stars. However, an argument could be made that the story needed this type of set to play out properly...I'm just saying it was pretty depressing. The story is set in a swampy area of Virginia and has a fair amount of action and tension. One of the lead characters has two or three marijuana plants growing on his porch and figures he'll be able to sell the pot when it's ready for harvest and make enough to give his wife a better life. Remember, I didn't give it five stars. Turns out the pot is junk and not able to get anyone 'high' so he goes about trying to come up with a way to get some good seeds to plant on his four acres of land. Meanwhile his wife is already working on her own plans for a better life and he suspects it. Throw in a local 'witch' who smokes profusely and reads bones in order to give his wife advice and you have the makings of this movie. Did I mention that this guy is also abusive? After giving our heroine a black eye he explains to her that that's just how he is and she needs to remember who she married. A real sweetheart of a guy! Of course there's also the demented friend of the husband who gets corralled into watching the wife and making sure she stays chained up while the husband is away. Well, you had to figure somebody would die and sho' nuff it happens. The local police woman appeared overly aloof and didn't seem to connect a body in a ditch with murder. She was ready to accept that it was either suicide or accidental death without so much as doing an investigation. She would never be a candidate for a part in CSI. This movie is worth watching if you can stomach the filth and don't mind the lack of startling twists. You the viewer are privileged to see everything that happens, which means, among other things, that you are never shocked by something unexpected. Not a lot of gore in this one, and only the slightest fleeting glimpse of nudity. Just as well since a naked woman covered in dirt would be less than arousing. Buy it...don't buy it...the choice is yours. I only rated it three stars because it would not be my first choice for a movie to watch. Enjoyable...for some, arguably, yes; for others, no.",1278201600,26,2988,4.36624775583483
2003823,5,B0001I2CHK,"I came across this movie on the LMN, and I loved it!! I was sucked right into this movie from the beginning, and caught myself wondering why isn't she doing this, or why doesn't she do that? I love Dominique Swain, and she was brilliant as a poor southern girl, and her friendship with her fortune teller friend was great, but the only part that really bugged me was WHY WAS SHE SO FILTHY THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE? I don't mean a filthy mouth, I mean, she obviously NEVER took a bath. EVER. I wanted to reach into the movie and throw her into the river myself.
I don't recommend this movie for everyone, I personally love everything about the south, and this movie has IT ALL! The accents, the messy house out in the bayou, the mental stalking crazy guy, the abusive husband,... if you like that kind of thing, this is the movie for you, but if not, you might want to invest in a movie like,... Girl, where Dominique is clean and sweet.",1215129600,9,935,4.318181818181818
2003824,4,B0001I2CHK,"I liked the way this movie worked.  We are introduced to a poor couple living in some nameless small town in the Deep South and watch this quirky little cast of characters live in squalor by choice as well as circumstance.  I liked that the movie portrayed the young pretty thing (Inez/Dominique Swain) realistically, she could not look too attractive in this film.  It starts out as a star-crossed lover movie but it's more of a fable - don't judge a book by its cover comes to mind along with several other proverbs.

Plot goes something like this: fortune teller friend (Karen Allen) advises Inez that her true love is waiting for her.  Inez assumes it's the rich pasty faced aristocrat with whom she has been fornicating.  Her husband, struggling to get them out of poverty through robbery and other schemes, is not happy about the long disappearances of his wife on a daily basis so he beats & locks her up to stop her cheating ways.  Flowers is a creepy figure that sniffs around Inez and helps the husband keep guard.  Inez talks Flowers into doing her dirty work but things do not turn out the way she planned.  The ending was very fitting and had an edgy fairytale quality to it.  Rain comes poring down on Inez and her one true love, washing all their dirt away.  Which made ""Plain Dirty"" a very apropos title - living life sometimes is just plain dirty unless you have a fairy godmother (Karen Allen) and fate bring you your one true love, by any means necessary.

There were key scenes that helped the characters come to life: when the husband places a chain around Inez' foot in an honest attempt to keep their marriage together, it is pathetic yet poignant; the touching scene where the fortune teller takes care of Inez and shares what little she has; or where Flowers and Inez discover they had the same childhood hiding spot.  These are not just ""backwoods hicks"" as one angry reviewer suggests and you don't need to go to poor areas to find people neglecting one another and ignoring what is right in front of them.  Also, I did not find Inez to be a helpless victim.  It is clear from the very beginning that it is not one of those movies.

I gave it four stars for the engrossing characters and plotline and subtracted one star for the loopy MacBeth references - they have no place here and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scotland-PA/dp/B00080ZGHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scotland, PA</a>&nbsp;does a greater job of updating Shakespeare's MacBeth then this movie.",1199491200,13,2530,4.835266821345708
