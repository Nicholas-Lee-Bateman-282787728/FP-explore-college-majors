Joey, Johnny, and DeeDee are gone, and a couple of their family members have control of the Ramones catalog.  Pissed that they didn't get to ""approve"" the story, they refused to grant rights.  So very sad, considering how many new fans would have been introduced to The Ramones, my favorite American rock band of all time.",1381536000,56,424,4.613333333333333
5967007,5,B00F3TDA2I,"does this film stink?
well remember; we are in 2013 & punk started out in 74-75.
from my point of view. we've been living over 30 years of total musical boredom or if you might prefer: some kind of silly revival.
now, let's get to the point. what interesting or exiting music have you found in these years?
grunge? lo fi? alternative? industrial? bla bla bla...
c'mooon...
since the record industry ( a la par with the music press industry)
saw that they could make money out of attitude instead out of music,
they've been brainwashing music lovers with total trash, for example remember that brit-poop crap?

well, you can say that this film is as sick as any of those remember films made in between this years (74-13).
but. let's admit it, this film is great. you gotta admit it that most of the actors are quite unbelievable
or might be even shocking, if you try to compare them to the real elements (lou reed per se. my god ! where did they illustrate themselves).
but once the shock is swallowed & you get to admit that this is only a film & not a documantary.
you'll find it easy to see that, above all, the element that made punk what it is: is something called attitude.
& i guess this film delivers it.
you wanna find elements more believable?
well, i would suggest one, but since were at amazon & my sons might read it.
i'll suggest that you go out & find all those unbelievable & dusty vinyls that made this era what it was.
& maybe some of those magazines that illustrated these times, because apart from that, you'll have a bad time trying to find out out more.
(also try out these among million others books, : Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain / From the Velvets to the Voidoids: A Pre-Punk History for a Post-Punk World by Clinton Heylin)
back to the film; it's clearly looks like it was dedicated to Hilly Kristal, god bless him. & that's the reason why the dead boys are repeatedly shown even though they were the second cbgb generation & not even from NYC.
anyway, if i was looking for a fault in this film...
well i would have liked to have heard other first generation bands such as: erasers, come on, speedies, suicide, mumps & ....
& i also wonder, why in the soundtrack version there is no metal machine music, though it does sound at the start of the film.",1381449600,18,2333,4.387990762124711

The film is basically a biopic of Hilly Kristal (who is portrayed as completely humorless) as it pertains to his founding and running of the club. Sure there are plenty of bands featured but while some of the casting is great (in the look-a-like dept), this only makes the poor casting look 10 times worse. This film is for people who are interested in the origins of 70's punk rock, and relatives of Hilly. Beyond that, I can't recommend it in good conscience.",1459209600,3,531,4.484536082474227

In a way this made no sense at all, what started as a country, blue grass and blues club ended up as the pinnacle of all punk rock clubs. One of the most famous if not thee most famous of all clubs ever. You need too see the story of how it got started and what happened. All though it has several stories in it, it is no documentary it is a fun and crazy film and I think even people who are not into punk rock will enjoy it. At times it's very funny and in the end it's sad that this venue is no more. 5 stars because i really like it not because its one of the great classic films but then it was never meant to be.

I loved the end credits where it showed The Talking Heads inducting Kristal into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame a short time before his death.

5967060,5,B00F3TDA2I,"*The Crowgrrl recently added a phenomenal flick to my personal DVD library: CBGB  a gritty yet lighthearted history of the legendary NYC nightclub that became the Mount Olympus of the Punk/Alternative music movement. I seriously love this movie, and cant re-watch it enough! It never gets old!

It focuses on the quirky club owner, Hilly Kristal (Alan Rickman) from his dream of the clubs inception to the Talking Heads honoring of him during their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and all the triumphs and tragedies along the way. Its ironic that the clubs moniker stood for Country, Bluegrass, and Blues, but the venue became famous for anything BUT those genres. We meet the nucleus of his behind-the-scenes cohorts like his daughter Lisa (Ashley Greene) (the one with the business smarts when Hilly was on the track to going for broke), his partner Merv (Donal Logue), soundman Taxi (Richard de Klerk), former junkie taken under wing Idaho (Freddy Rodriguez), Televisions manager Terry Ork (John Galecki), etc. Not to mention the infamous Jonathan the Dog, who  according to the credits  his bowels were legendary. Jonathan was also the impetus for combat boots becoming an integral part of Punk couture.

It also shares the perspective on the music by Punk Magazine founder/writer Legs McNeil (Peter Vack) and his cronies as they documented the vibe the musicians and club were creating.

The casting was incredible! Especially those that portrayed Iggy Pop (Taylor Hawkins), Patti Smith (Mickey Sumner), Joey Ramone (Joel David Moore), Blondie (Malin Akerman), and Cheetah Chrome (Rupert Grint) who truly captured the essence of those they were portraying. (I swear, Joel David Moore mustve been channeling Joey Ramones spirit  he even had Joeys walk and mannerisms down! Kudos!) And, of course, me being The Crowgrrl, it didn't escape my notice that Michael Massey  Funboy from The Crow  was the resident police officer in the film.

The music itself is one of the great highlights of the movie, pretty much the soundtrack of my younger years. It still makes my heart skip a beat or two when I hear it  especially Joey Ramones songs, Patti Smiths Because the Night and the Talking Heads Psycho Killer.

Ive noticed that any Ramones song featured is actually a song from Joeys first solo album. I asked Joeys brother, Mickey Leigh, what is the reasoning for this? Some kind of copyright dispute?

Mickey replied, Well. I can tell you that you are getting warm. That said, to answer this question would require me to clear my answers with not only my attorney, but Lindas former manager and attorney. It could cost me upwards of $2-$3,000. But, it will be worth it. This is the first time Ive ever said of this publicly. As I was told by the producers, the manager Linda Cummings Ramone had procured  whos name sounds very much like John Cafiero when translated into English- was demanding from the producers an amount of money far above what the other bands, such as Blondie, Talking Heads, Television etc , had agreed to. He was also insisting that the John Cummings Family Trust have approval over the actor chosen to play Johnny as well as his lines. Additionally, he wanted a consultants fee and credit in the ending reel. Furthermore, he would not sign off on use of the Ramones original masters unless he was provided a private trailer personally designed by John Varvatos. Ok, that last one was a joke. He required that all words he spoke while on the set be personally written by Jon Stewart. Not Jon Stewart the comedian, Jon Stewart the jockey and winner of 6 Kentucky Derbys. The producers were ambitious, but the budget was very low. They could only offer him buy one, get one free coupons for Marky Ramones Meatball Legacy heroes- if his truck passed by after Kraft services closed. I know, its a sad thing. Ironically (ahhh, theres my iron!) Marky is the person who brought the guy whos name sounds like John Cafiero into the fold of Ramones World. Yeah, I know its a sad thought. Stop thinking about it. Try his ice cream pasta sauce instead.

Its a shame that this movie was released quietly and directly to DVD in December, 2013. This is the definitive history of how the nucleus of Punk and Alternative exploded into one of the most important movements in Music and Culture. It is absolutely essential to any music lovers library!!!",1425600000,,4368,4.836461126005362

It was a surprisingly decent tribute to Hilly Kristal, the man responsible for the birth of punk rock. Groups like The Ramones and Blondie launched their careers at CBGB. The acronym stands for Country, Blue Grass, and Blues. That was his vision for his club, thus the name. But it was never that.

This is not a docu-drama but just a  good idea poorly researched, written, performed and exhibited.  The background of the Bowery which should be a major part of the movie looked nothing in real life as portrayed in this little flick. This movie turned 3 dimensional larger than life personalities into a little more than cardboard cutouts.  I am guessing that Alan Rickman needed a quick buck as this is not his style at all.  Not a movie that anyone will watch more than once.",1405209600,3,592,4.394495412844036

The best example I have of the sloppiness, is at the very end.  They have ""The Police"" on stage playing for Hilly.  The look alikes are all wrong.  The Sting look alike is okay, but they have the Andy Stewart look alike playing the drums and the Stewart Copeland look alike playing the Guitar.  This is a band that plays arenas.  People know what they look like.  It is just an example of how little someone cared about the content or presentation. I am not sure if they were trying to make me laugh for the sake of laughing or if they were laughing at us.  The soundtrack is fine, but if you were interested in the subject in the first place you already have all of that in originals.  If you want to see an imaginary movie, about imaginary caricature ""punks"" and have no idea what CBGB was.  Enjoy.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed.",1402444800,2,1011,4.181347150259067

My first tattoo was a big A for anarchy...it is still there and I still despise corporate rock. If you were a punk you will like this movie. Yes it could have been better, I would still love to see a movie that delved into the real attitude of punk rock but CBGB is still a fun movie.

It is not all that accurate from a historical standpoint and there are some real omissions as to the bands that are shown (I would bet that copyrights had a lot to do with that...so not punk rock) but what is there is a blast.

I have been a BIG fan of the DEAD BOYS since those days and still am, it is great to see them in a feature film (seeing Ron Weasly from Harry Potter as Cheetah Chrome is worth watching this by itself).

5967095,4,B00F3TDA2I,"This was a very good movie. I must admit I like pretty much anything Alan Rickman appears in. This time, he plays Hilly Kristal who started the legendary CBGB bar. I wasn't really a fan of the comic book scene intros, but it works, and the viewer gets a history lesson on how Hilly was able to buy a broken down bar and began to showcase original bands and give birth to the American punk scene. I've actually watched it a few times now and keep finding things i missed. Johnny Ramone's character gets mad and storms off stage 3 or 4 times throughout the show, something he was famous for in real life. Also, Joey Ramone's character delivers the line of the movie for me when they get signed to a record deal ""I can't believe we got signed.. We suck""",1399766400,3,750,4.288732394366197

When times were changing, and music could exhilarate and frighten and motivate people. Hilly and his CBGB club was there to usher in those times, and thank God he did. It changed everything. This film offers the humor, the challenges, the drama, all that was part of creating something unique and original and memorable. Brilliantly made, brilliantly acted.

The way they portrayed it in a comic book popup style I thought fit really well with it and it was cool too.  The movie was cast extremely well too; all of the actors were able to give a gritty enough performance needed for showing that whole scene.  Now, a previous comment mentioned that the Bowery didn't look like how it was shown in the movie, I'm not familiar with that section of NYC, so it didn't have any effect on me.

I got pass the language and the sexual scenes to truly appreciate Hilly Kristal's love of music. His devotion to giving fellow lovers of music their chance to perform. He truly cared for the people he was helping ie medical for one of the ""Dead Boys"". His vision to see that terrible part of New York as a place for a show case of talent. By no means my type of music but I could appreciate his devotion at great odds to himself. The story stayed with me long after I watched the movie.

If you're a young kid and are new to punk rock I suppose this would be just as good of place to start as any considering a lot of the bands that helped make it what it is in NYC at the time play their part in this movie. The lack of Ramones songs is a disappointment but I guess they did what they could to make up for it with Joey's solo stuff. I read one review that complained about the lack of character development. I personally don't believe it's all that necessary. If you are familiar with punk or CBGB's in any way then you've already heard or watched the stories or if you were one of the lucky ones (unlike myself) lived them. If you are looking for something containing more facts and a little more in depth then check out some of the many documentaries that include the history of this legendary place.

As a dramatization it is entertaining.  It gives a glimpse into who Hilly Kristel was, it is unfortunate that that the depth is llittle more than what a passerby would get.  In short it is a tourist version of CBGB.

That accepted, Alan Rickman is good in his role as Hilly, portraying him as somewhere between aloof rebel and clueless visionary.  The performances are lipsynched, but the songs are good.  Editting kind of messed with the chronology, but then again maybe it was to kind of show a blur to the participants.

5967137,2,B00F3TDA2I,"CBGB represents many things to many people and thousands of acts have played the venue over the years.  Many went on to fame or notoriety.  But only one band that broke from CBGB would become the biggest commercial act of all-time from that scene... and it was and still is Blondie.  This film represents the downtown, NYC club scene well and brings you back in moments that are very hair-raising-realistic.  But, as a longtime Blondie supporter and for these producers to know Blondie and Debbie Harry's now-iconic status, it was actually painful to watch the ill-cast Malin Akerman as lead singer for Blondie.  Absolutely *nothing* about her reads ""Debbie Harry"".  Let's face it, if this film does nothing else, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that simply having blonde hair and wearing knee-high boots does not an icon make.  Malin comes across as harsh, insecure and brittle and looks nothing like the well-known sultry songstress.  The only emotion she gives is the sense of being pissed off the whole time she is on screen.  You just want to get up and phone Debbie Harry at home and say, ""Excuse me, have you seen this film?  No?  Good.  Would you mind coming over here and playing this part?""  That being said, considering Debbie Harry herself looks as young today as Malin Akerman, she probably SHOULD have played herself!  Now THERE'S a way to make this film a box office smash!  But what did it in for me was when Malin spoke in that sharp, cheezy-phony, over-the-top Brooklyn accent (she obviously didn't study Debbie's soft New Jersey voice or mannerisms at all).  I cringed.  You have to ask yourself, ""Did anybody even *attempt* to consult Blondie or Debbie Harry before this happened?""  The answer is ""No, they didn't"".  Debbie and Chris (Stein; guitarist/founder of Blondie) mentioned it recently.  So, hoping for something wonderful with this film and being left with the sense of ""How could this have happened?"", I gave my copy of CBGB away the same night I watched the film.  I would agree that Hilly Kristal, Iggy Pop and the club itself are vividly brought back to life on screen.  There were times in the film where I wanted so bad to walk in that front door again because the surroundnigs truly ring accurate.  But to misrepresent Blondie and Debbie Harry, the most influential and most successful original artists from CBGB, in such a shameful way, is unforgivable and ends-up being a poison apple to this film.",1390780800,2,2441,4.77326968973747

So glad I did!  It chronicles the endeavors of Hillel Crystal (Hilly) and the run-down joint he buys that eventually becomes the infamous CBGB.  I had NO IDEA of just how many bands this man helped become at least brought out of obscurity if only for a while, not to mention the many punk and rock acts that eventually went on to become very famous (and very rich) because of his vision in that dirty, leaky, grungy, poorly-lit, broken down club.  Hilly's true talent in my opinion was that he was able to hear a bands musical chops, even in their early days, despite what they looked like or how they acted.  You'll see several familiar faces in this one, and some really good actors and actresses that portray these bands.  Hat's off to you, Hilly!  Thanx, man.  Thanx A LOT!",1390262400,10,1025,4.5027027027027025
5967141,5,B00F3TDA2I,"In my neighborhood in Philly growing up most of my friends were Led Zeppelin or Yes fiends while I was a Beatles and Stones fan.  I attended Temple University in 1981 and became acquainted with suburban kids who turned me on to alternative music and taught me to think outside the box.  I never fully embraced punk but the shows were a lot of fun more than a Jethro Dull concert.  I still recall a packed Ramones concert at the now defunct Chestnut Cabaret in 1987 when I was pushed up against a speaker and my ears were ringing for days afterward.  This film captures the excitement of those times.  Far from perfect director Randall Miller's film in its own grungy ragged way works because it is a celebration of the punk ethos.  I'm amazed this film was ever made at all because with few exceptions CBGB created marginally commercial acts who barely got any airplay with the exception of college radio.  I doubt the Ramones ever cracked the Top 40 in this country but were superstars nonetheless and acknowledged as innovators by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  If I were to describe this film it would be akin to Alan Arkush's ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" informed by the late lamented rock magazine ""Trouser Press"".  If anything see this film for Alan Rickman's heartfelt portrayal of Hilly Kristal, the visionary but good naturedly financially misguided owner of CBGB.  The closest I ever got to CBGB was the outside in 1986 and its exterior was dumpy.  This film gives you a sense of time and place and to feel what it was like to be in one of these clubs. An Oscar should go to the film's filth coordinator.  ""CBGB"" is a cult favorite in the making.  One little nitpick.  Patti Smith is shown in the film breaking Hilly's rule of singing only original material by performing a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Because the Night"".  ""Entertainment Weekly"" took this tidbit as grounds to categorically dismiss the film in a truncated review which leads me to believe that the reviewer is either a Journey or Styx fan.",1390262400,2,2019,4.600558659217877

I grew up on the east coast and a huge fan of punk music so I knew I had to see this as soon as I heard about it. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, and being familiar with the bands and people, the Ramones, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, David Bryne, ect. I did find the story somewhat incomplete and dare I say a little disney, for the most part it ignored all the drugs sex violence and anarchy associated with the club and the punk scene in general and could've just as easily been the story of any dive bar anywhere,  If you're a fan of the artists and the punk scene or have ever been to GBGB you will likely enjoy the film, but I'm not sure how much Barbra Streisand fans or others will enjoy it, basically it's entertaining and a decent flick, if you're into it, but it's not a definitive look at the club or the punk scene of the day.",1390176000,2,1018,4.064676616915423

5967144,5,B00F3TDA2I,"Sometimes there's a force so strong that it's going to find a way to break through no matter what and in this case that is punk music.  Sometimes you just have to persevere, be in the right place and the right time and take ""yes"" for an answer and in this case that is Hilly Kristal.  Kristal stated the famed CBGB club because he thought country music was going to be the next big thing.  CBGB actually stands for Country, Bluegrass & Blues and that is what Kristal had in mind for the club.

What turned out instead to play were a bunch of raw punk bands and Kristal was smart enough to ride the wave and let these bands play.  Huge acts like The Talking Heads, Blondie, The Ramones and The Police got their start at CBGB and have credited Kristal with being instrumental in launching the punk scene.

The movie isn't a documentary, so don't expect it to be.  It is a pretty good representation of the times and is a very entertaining movie with some great music.  I think even people who aren't fans of the punk scene would enjoy watching this movie as it's much more about the people surrounding the club and a story of Hilly Kristal who went through a couple of bankruptcies before hitting it big with the club.

Overall I'd say this is a must watch for anyone that loves punk music and music in general.",1390089600,6,1309,4.331967213114754

This may be true, but the fact that a movie was made about this scene is quite positive, Indeed, the New York scene that emerged at CBGB was enormously influential but at the same time, the origin was sometimes forgotten. This movie tries to retrace the debuts of the club. While some of the acting and storyline are  not always great, it is very entertaining and gives a feel for the period to some degree even to this of use who were not present. One criticism can be that the bands are not always well represented, such as Blondie. But, who cares, because if you are interested in this musical period the movie gives you a great moment of escapism, even if it may not entirely reflect what happened.

As much as I imagine the scene at CBGB was about life, expression and brashness, the movie seemed to drag. It didn't help things that I could barely understand Alan Rickman as Hilly Kristal. Most of the time - and maybe he was directed to do this - he mumbled his dialog and was - as Jerry Seinfeld would say - a low talker. There also didn't seem to be much character development. All the relevant people were present in the casting, but the interaction seemed superficial. I could also have done without the cartoon frames.

On the positive side, the music was great, and the actors cast to play the musicians were well above average. Even the music pantomiming was above average.  However, given this was a movie featuring punk, it was rather limp.",1389052800,,903,4.567901234567901

5967158,5,B00F3TDA2I,"Rupert Grint. I just think he's SUCH a good actor so far beyond Ron Weasley. And I think I'd watch anything Alan Rickman was in, period. Which leads me to CBGB, a film I wasn't sure about - I haven't always been a big fan of the punk music scene, and that's an understatement - but this was actually a fun, funny, and truly entertaining movie about the infamous New York City club that gave many (MANY) new bands (punk and otherwise) their first chance at public exposure back in the 1970s ... and about the man who started it, the flaky, cranky, foul-mouthed, yet utterly loveable Hilly Kristal (Rickman).

A man of dubious talents who already has two bankruptcies under his belt, Hilly borrows money from his mother to open a club in the Bowery that will cater to the new, upcoming big trend in music: Country, Bluegrass, and Blue (which is how the club got its name, CBGB, an acronym for the music he wanted to showcase). The acts that came along, however, were more rock, hard rock, and punk oriented, but provided they played by Hilly's one rule - ALL original music, no covers or retreads of established hits - he booked acts he thought had potential (turns out, he thought MANY of them had potential). As the club gave birth to acts like The Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie, Television, Talking Heads, Iggy Pop, The Dead Boys, The Police and more, it become THE place for underground bands wanting their voices heard to be played ... and THE place to be if you were cool, for soon Hilly's club becomes packed wall to wall with people, the club itself gaining national attention as some of its acts got signed and become superstars.

But Hilly sucked as a businessman, wanting to help everyone - giving junkies work to do around the club to help them survive, letting many people in for free who couldn't pay - and as Hilly, Rickman is just incredible at playing a quirky, emotionally detached yet oh-so-generous entrepreneur who can't seem to understand he's running his own success into the ground. The film is so damned interesting (and fun!) to watch, between the music and Rickman and a fine supporting cast, as well as CBGB, the real star of the film. If you see it, stick around for the end credits, where you will get both a look at and feel for the real-like inspiration for the film, Hillly Kristal.

As the legend goes punk wasn't born here but after bands such as Blondie, The Ramones, The Police and Iggy Pop punk was discovered here. I have to admit I am not a fan of punk music. I did like the Police and some songs by the bigger named artists but overall it's not one of my favorite genres. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this going in but I really ended up liking it. Alan Rickman is great in this (as always) and the story moved fast enough that there really wasn't a boring part in this at all.

It is almost unwatchable. I am of the age that the musical artists were staples in my record collection in high school, I remember when ""Road to Ruin"" was new in record stores and the day that ""Parallel Lines"" was released-- I missed the earliest days but I was an eager participant in the sophomore years of the punk and new wave era.

The movie was flat, the performances uninspired. Punk rock was widely perceived as ""dangerous"" and very threatening in those days, but now, after the Green Dayification and mainstreaming of supposed punk attitude as toothless suburban fashion statement this just seemed like another mass-produced, pre-ripped ""punk rock"" T-shirt that you might find at Abercrombie and Fitch, style without substance.

5967169,1,B00F3TDA2I,"This is a very poor, inaccurate film that is supposed to be a tribute to the late Hilly Kristal, the man who owned the bar in the title of the film. The film does not do him any favors.

It is offered up as a ""light hearted"" ""modern"" ""only a movie not a documentary ""comedy by the film makers but it is anything but that.

Instead it is a badly conceived and directed, unfunny, poorly written excuse for a film with wooden acting(except for Alan Rickman who does the best that he can under the circumstances), the worst lip synching that you're ever likely to see in a film that ends up being just a jumbled mess and a waste of over one and a half hour of viewing time.

However if your brand of humor embraces a dog pooping on screen in close up there are about 10 sequences of that. I guess that's the film makers' idea of a ""humor"" factor.

Please take heed of the critics' reviews on this one. Sometimes they are not in consensus with the viewing audience but in this case they are absolutely spot on. As of this writing CBGB sits at 11% out of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and that score is artificially high due to the fact that one of the three ""positive"" reviews was actually a rather scathing one that is mislabeled as a good one.

There are a lot of audience reviews put up on RT and IMDB (where the critic's scores are similarly low) by members of the fan clubs of the various younger actors in the film. I would advise that you would beware of any review that has the word ""awesome"" in it.

Bottom line..unless you think that anything that Stana and co. appear in ,for however short a time they appear on screen,is ""awesome""don't waste you money on this film. Go have a look at the Youtube videos of the original artists who did their apprenticeships at CBGB and were helped along their way by Hilly Kristal. Then you can treat yourself to a couple of CDs or downloads of any early album by Patti Smith, The Ramones, Blondie, Television, Mink De Ville, Suicide, The Heartbreakers, Talking Heads, or any of the other great bands that got their start at the club.
