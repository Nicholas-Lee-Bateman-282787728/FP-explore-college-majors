7992594,1,B00009QG6L,"I thought a Spanish movie from this time period involving Sirpa Lane and George Hilton would be interesting.  Wrong!  Sirpa spends most of her time dressed up in a most unbecoming period costume, and even George Hilton couldn't breathe a bit of life into this unhistorical historical ... softcore movie?  At any rate the video is no help, seemingly taken from a video source and featuring washed out colors.  Being a completist, I thought this would make an interesting item for my collection.  Don't make this same mistake.",1324512000,,524,4.909090909090909
