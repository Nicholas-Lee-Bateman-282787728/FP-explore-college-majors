4001726,3,B002VWNIDQ,"What irritates me the most about this DVD is the ""Uncensored warning"" on the cover. Again this is only for the special features, NOT for the 10 episodes!!! This seems to be a trend with Adult Swim items. Just like Metalocalypes and Venture Brothers, this dvd is full of bleeps! What is the point of that? The main reason I collect these is to avoid the censorship and to enjoy them as they are meant to be viewed.",1267747200,54,413,4.3076923076923075
4001727,5,B002VWNIDQ,"This is the greatest show ever made. If you watch it, eat some mushrooms or take a ride with lucy before hand. You will see a level of this show that cannot be seen with the naked eye, it's truly astonishing. I hear the DVD isn't uncensored like advertised, but I don't care. I'm buying it because for once in my life I feel like someone deserves my money for their artistic efforts. I've already seen every episode many many times. It's insane. I feel like the Warden himself is a shrooming mad man.",1267747200,2,500,4.329787234042553
4001728,2,B002VWNIDQ,"SuperJail is by far one of the greatest pieces of animation to hit TV in the last ten years.
Clearly it's not for younger viewers as it was developed for the AdultSwim programming block on Cartoon Network.
As I mentioned before this is not a review of the Show, but of AdiultSwim's DVD product.

While the show is great in and of itself, this DVD is not.

Once again Adultswim is releasing a DVD with an ""UNCENSORED"" sticker on the package (Like they did with the Metyalocalypse DVDs) when this content is still COMPLETELY CENSORED as it was on the original Cablecasts and ""air dates"".
This is ridiculous.
I bought this DVD to see this amazing show without the silly BLACK BARS over images and without loud BEEPS over language.
Instead only the animatics, -the auxiliary extra content- is free of censor beeps etc.
I hope Adultswim smartens up and eventually releases these shows uncut, uncensored as they are currently advertising -falsely.
I doubt I'll be buying more Adultswim DVDs outside of the Venture Bros. releases (which actually are UNCENSORED as advertised)
I received this DVD in the mail on Thursday, and I just sold it this morning.

I'm waiting for the real uncensored version if it ever comes out.

4001729,2,B002VWNIDQ,"First off, I love Superjail! and was really excited for the season one DVD to come out.  It does contain all the episodes from the first season and.....that's really it.  No commentary or any other extras to speak of other than a music video, the pilot, and animatics.  Boring.
Also:  while it says that it is ""Uncensored""  I have found that it is, in all actuality, still censored.  There are still *bleeps* when people swear and still boxes for nudity.
So not only are you getting false advertising, but an absolutely bare bones ordeal of a DVD.
Its a shame too, because they could have done something great with the DVD.  Maybe the next one will be better.",1266969600,10,659,4.533898305084746

4001731,5,B002VWNIDQ,"First of all, this is not a show for children and this is not a show for adults. This is a show for people with an acquired taste. Happy Tree Friends + Willy Wonka + Chaotic art style. If those things are up your alley then you will absolutely fall in LOVE with Superjail!. Each episode is around 15 minutes in length, but I certainly consider it to be one of the most well-written, well-put together, well thought-out shows to ever be played on Adult Swim. The violence and gore play out like an instrumental score, flowing graceful in a freakishly poetic way. The characters are the most endearing that I have seen on Adult Swim in YEARS. They have depth and are multi-faceted, voiced wonderfully, and hilarious. If one looks past the outer layer of obvious gore, one will appreciate how beautifully made this show is. Definitely hoping for Season 2!!!!!",1266451200,10,856,4.6381578947368425
4001732,5,B002VWNIDQ,"If I could rate this show any higher than 5 stars, I would. This is definitely the most beautifully chaotic show I've ever seen. It sucks you into an ultra-violent dreamworld.

4001826,4,B002VWNIDQ,"I decided to pick up this DVD after finding a used DVD copy of ""Ugly Americans"" Season 1.  I blazed through the rest of the UAS1 episdoes, and went looking for the second season, only to find out that it was only available for online viewing in Amazon.  However, the recommendation for ""Superjail"" came up based on my search, so I decided to order it and give it a whirl.  I just received the DVD in the mail yesterday, and played about three episodes of ""Superjail!"" Season 1.

O-M-F-G!!  Wow!!  It's like watching the id of a madman running wild with glee.  It is incredibly mind-blowing, tasteless, gross and fascinating, all at the same time.  It's a catharsis of raging insanity.  I would say that if the Dada art movement could be summed up in a cartoon, Superjail! would be that cartoon.

This is definitely not for adults of delicate sensibilities or young children.  It is truly a mad, mad, mad universe depicted in ""Superjail!"".

So if you find the insanity or day-to-day life starting to wear you down, pop in a Superjail! disc and watch an episode or three.  It really makes you glad that it's only a crazy, wild frenetic fantasy.  Even if such a place were to exist in some alternate quantum reality, we should count our blessings that we're here, and not there!  ;)",1400716800,2,1279,4.548245614035087

4001828,5,B002VWNIDQ,"I love, love this show.  This is one of my favorite shows.  I had to have season 2 and 3 because season 1 was so amazing!!! I watch this DVD every month.  This cartoon is very trippie and hilarious.  Great adult cartoon!",1396915200,,220,4.166666666666667

4001830,5,B002VWNIDQ,"I have watched Superjail! before on Adult Swim and found it to be somewhat entertaining. More over it reminded me of some comics that my father collects called Zap.

4001831,5,B002VWNIDQ,"After watching several episodes of this animated series in a row, I start to feel like a protective layer has been torn off of my brain and images and ideas flood in, seemingly without control.  I could see this effect being 'too much' for most people, but occasionally I like my entertainment to be wild and impossible to fully behold in one viewing.  There's a particular episode that revolves around the not-funny topic of cancer which possibly made me laugh and cry at the same time, and I mean laugh deeply and feel horrible pain at the same time.

4001843,5,B002VWNIDQ,I've seen a few episodes on Adult Swim and I became an instant fan. The animation and the whole flow of the show is what makes it attractive (to me). Some of the stuff even reminds me of Salvador Dali paintings.,1362268800,,211,4.170731707317073
4001854,4,B002VWNIDQ,"I work at a hole in the wall bar and we play classic DVDs, film, and music video stuff from our TVs silently over our generic bar playlists.  Every now and then I program Superjail Season 1 to play around closing from a couple TVs, when people are at their drunkest.  The amount of transfixed stares and conversation we get always makes me smile. I heard the most ""normal"" girly girl exclaim ""why is something so gross so pretty"" as she paid her tab.

Personally, the artistic soul of Superjail S1 is its most appealing feature. I could watch about 5 of these episodes over and over, and enjoy the rest occasionally as well. Superjail could be described as fresh, energetic, frantic, whimsical, and most of all, fun.  Even then, Superjail is not accessible to most people and it takes an open mind, an open moment, or a trusted recommendation to watch the first time.

It is not without its flaws, as a repeat watcher will find stutters in the flow or distasteful/low quality dialogue interspersed with the overall greatness of the season.  They are few and far, but just enough to lower it a star.

The Warden and Jared are my favorite characters, I think they are spot on and perfectly designed. My least favorite is Alice, as a jaded internet-savvy mid-20s youth I have ""been there done that"" with characters like Alice, but she is still likeable and has her moments which make me smile.

The case is actually white (that's where the surprise was which I liked).
The pilot episode is really episode 1 that you've seen on TV, and it's in standard resolution instead of widescreen like all the other episodes on the DVD (very disappointing).
There are little hiccups in the voice over work due to it being a mexican DVD.

4001894,4,B002VWNIDQ,"I've been asked, ""Why do you like this show?"" ""Superjail!"" is incredibly fast-paced; it's packed with wall-to-wall gore and violence of the type only seen on Adult Swim (or in anime); and the viewer only understands what's going on after two or three repeat viewings of any episode. Yet I can't stop watching it.

How to describe it? Every episode begins with the latest adventure of Jackknife, the only inmate ever to escape Superjail, which he does at the end of each and every episode. Meanwhile, at the beginning of every episode, Jackknife is caught by the Jailbot in the middle of doing something disgusting, obscene, and inhuman, and the Jailbot flies him back to Superjail through a psychedelic landscape, in a sequence that is different with each episode. (No animated sequence ever repeats itself on this show!) Superjail is in an impossible location, a gigantic fortress within a volcano, within an even bigger volcano. This is the type of idea you'd expect to see in drawings from the imagination of a seven-year-old child...and in fact, the entire design of the animation, right down to the hand-drawn ""Superjail!"" logo, has that aspect. It's as if the series creators took a hundred years' worth of graffiti and doodles from the back pages of bored elementary school students' textbooks, and brought them to absurd, sadistic life.

There are only few actual ""characters"" here - the Warden, the insane yet naive and child-like overlord who treats Superjail as his own personal Christmas toy; Jared, the nervous and shy accountant with a gigantic forehead not unlike The Leader from The Incredible Hulk; Alice, the hermaphrodite prison guard with strong female overtures, even stronger muscles, and a deep baritone voice (who really gets off on the tortures and sick perversions that take place all the time in Superjail); and the strange Twins, who appear to be from the future or maybe another dimension, causing trouble and havoc in Superjail just because they're bored and want to liven things up. And then there's the jail itself, with its thousands upon thousands of inmates who pack the frames of every moment of this show. Other than Jackknife, none of them is an actual personality; they're there for our entertainment, as we watch them suffer the whims of the Warden's latest idea, dying horrible deaths by the hundreds in sequences that happen so fast, they scream for DVD and frame-by-frame examination.

I think it's the animation that makes this show what it is - outrageous, absurdly glorious animation that is refreshingly unlike anything else showing today, on TV or in the movies. There's no CGI, the designs seem to be taken from bad 1960s acid trips (one episode has a five-second-or-so clip that's a direct homage to Yellow Submarine's Sea of Monsters), and there is (refreshingly) absolutely no influence of anime stereotypes anywhere at all in this show! What's more, every single frame of this show is packed with movement, with something happening in every single frame. This is an animation background designer's paradise, as you can look at any part of any scene and see something strange. You could freeze-frame any moment of any episode, and I would defy you to describe that single image in anything less than three paragraphs. This contributes to much of the reality-defying moments of the show. It moves at such a breakneck pace that we're treated to sudden sequences in which the gore and action flow off on strange tangents, unrelated to the main plot in any way other than we're watching the inmates die in unendingly creative ways. There's so much going on here that it threatens to overwhelm the viewer...but, somehow, it works. Each episode is only about eleven minutes long, and that's for the best; this show is taken best in small doses. Maybe that's why we don't care that there isn't much of a plot or any actual characters other than the regular cast - we don't need them.

This could be one of those shows where the creators went for broke: not knowing if they were going to be renewed for a second season, they poured all of their ideas and creativity into the first season, resulting in one of those flashes in the pan that may not last into a second season. There will be a second season of ""Superjail!,"" and like its other fans I am hoping that it is every bit as good as the first, or even better. But even if it isn't, the first season will stand like the original first season of ""Ren and Stimpy"" - an instant classic of surrealism that makes your jaw drop as you can't believe what you are seeing, but you simply enjoy every moment of the experience.",1282780800,17,4615,4.815889029003783
4001895,5,B002VWNIDQ,"When I first saw this on TV, I spent the rest of the night shaking my head after picking up my jaw.  What had I just seen, on network TV?!?  Seriously, it's not a socially redeeming show at all - you certainly wouldn't show it to, say, your girlfriend, family, boss, or anyone other than your sicko drinking buddies for shock-value.  But dammit, the animation is some of the best, most creative, visceral and energetic, well-timed work I've seen in a LONG time and both it and the stories are just unbelievable - every subsequent episode brings more and more of the greatest, craziest stuff I have ever seen.  It's my guilty pleasure, I can't take my eyes off of it, even while cringing, peaking through my fingers.  Wow.  I can't believe this ever got made for TV, nor so well.  Actually, perhaps it should never have been made at all - it's really, really violent, sick and sickly sexual.  Personally, I think it needs a little censorship; I think the other reviewers' complaints are kind of groundless, except maybe when it comes to preserving the artists' original vision.  I'll bet they just want to see more of Alice....I wonder what Ralph Bakshi thinks of Superjail?  I wonder if there could ever be a season 2?  And what can Cartoon Network possibly do next to top it, especially for sheer shock value?  Now that's a scary thought....
Finally, contemporary american animation that is not just sardonic, sarcastic, boring, or nothing more than another sitcom/torturous paycheck for lowly animators.  This is over the top animation at its finest, a direct descendant of what the looney tunes guys showed so long ago - as far as pushing animation's endless creative horizon - but much, MUCH much sicker.  I also liked King of the Hill, Robot Jones, etc - anything well done, and this definitely fits that description, though I think it made a new category for itself in the process.",1281830400,,1887,4.713414634146342
4001896,4,B002VWNIDQ,"If you are sensitive to scenes of mass-bloodshed, dismemberment, sexual depravity and mutilation, avoid this animated series.  If that was not enough of a clue...,  then let me be even more clear..., this is not for children! And probably not for most adults either.

On the other hand, this is probably the most refreshingly original animation ever allowed to be broadcast on television. There is an overwhelming amount of detailed animation crammed into every scene and trying to see it all in one sitting is practically impossible, you have to watch each episode several times if you want to be able to catch all the quirks and little details happening.

The story, plot line, etc.., is meaningless and fruitless to try to understand.  This series is not about telling a story, but is meant to be a visual shockwave that takes your eyes on a breathless rollercoaster ride.  And like any great rollercoaster ride, you should be prepared to possibly be sick to your stomach afterwards.

The series is set around a massive prison system , apparently designed to hold the most violent and malevolent criminals in the world, some of whom appear to have superhuman abilities.  The warden ... ( known only as ""The Warden"" )..., of this prison is a rambling eccentric egomaniac with a childish whimsical mindset who also is a genius-level intellectual and he creates bizarre devices and machines to experiment with ways of controlling the population of Superjail. There is no mistaking him since he typically dresses in an outfit that looks something like a cross between a circus ringmaster and a magician.

Somehow ..., there seems to be only one guard ( perhaps the others are behind the scenes somewhere...), a very unattractive female amazon-like steriod-pumped powerhouse who keeps the prisoners in line with crushing blows from her fists and feet.  Also aiding in keeping order is ""Jailbot"", a robotic guard with a bloodhound-like tracking capability who helps control the population and retrieve escaped convicts.

I recommend getting this disk,  but only if you have a strong stomach and a genuine delight for wild off-the-wall animated mayhem.  There simply is nothing else out there that matches this series, it's a truly different experience.

The disk worked well.  Perfect video and audio.  No flaws.

4001897,4,B002VWNIDQ,"This show is an incredible cartoon that will blow your mind with the amount of ...things going on on-screen at once.  The incredible violent scenes that top off every episode are painstakingly detailed and perfectly timed.  I can only hope that sales of this DVD set lead to another season of this highly original cartoon series.  BUT...there is an issue with the actual DVD that no one seems to document and I have not had any luck getting a response on.  After trading my DVD in multiple times to multiple locations, there are a series of small audio/video glitches in the EXTRA pilot episode ""Bunny Love"".  After dealing with so many copies of the DVD I'm guessing it's not just an issue with a certain ""Shipment"" of them.  Right near the end of the episode, the video/audio pauses three seperate times and the video gets a second of ""lines"" through it.  Clearly an issue with rendering it to DVD...but I don't know if this will ever be addressed being that this is a small time show in the scheme of things.

I will still keep this DVD however, as this show is worth every penny.  Video quality overall is 9/10.  When the chaos hits the screen it does it best (as much as DVD can) but sometimes the colors block and blur.  That just happens with DVD compression though.  I'd give it an 8 because it's very minimal.

I'm just hoping I'm not the only one encountering this glitch in the pilot episode.",1271635200,2,1403,4.4980237154150196
