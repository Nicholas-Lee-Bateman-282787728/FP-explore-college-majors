8093584,2,B000BWPDFO,"The first 30 minutes were fun and dynamic, but after that slow and kind of boring, more for a last trimester..",1478908800,,110,4.285714285714286
8093585,5,B000BWPDFO,"I bought this set of dvds between having my 1st and 2nd children.  Now my 3rd child is 2 years old, and I still pull out the prenatal dvd and do the salsa dance.  It's a good level for those of us who have killed our ankles and knees with years of exercise :)  It's nice that Leisa Hart was actually pregnant when she made the first one, and had her baby with her for the second.  Makes her more likable, as she actually knows what she's talking about!",1449187200,,452,4.044943820224719
8093586,4,B000BWPDFO,"This one got me through my first pregnancy. The moves were easy to pick up, it wasn't too strenuous, and leisa was a very good instructor; positive, and always reminding you during the workout if you need to take a rest to do it. My husband heard it in the other room and loved that she did that during the exercise. Haven't  done the post natal yet, but I can assure you the breathing and salsa dancing on the pre were my favorites!",1437523200,,433,4.216867469879518
8093587,5,B000BWPDFO,Well made and useful. Pushes you without overdoing it.,1433808000,,54,5.111111111111111
8093588,4,B000BWPDFO,The yoga is VERY repetitive and monotonous but the rest is fun.  The instructor is very pleasant...,1275696000,,99,4.823529411764706
8093589,3,B000BWPDFO,I used this video a few times when I was pregnant and i pulled a muscle in my hip. I would recommend taking it easy the first few times you do it.  I couldn't do the workout for weeks after that.  Watch where you shake it!,1274313600,,222,3.8043478260869565
8093590,5,B000BWPDFO,I bought this for my wife so she could exercise during the pregnancy and it turned out to be and excellent daily exercising trainer...,1227484800,,134,4.625
8093591,4,B000BWPDFO,"I got his dvd during my first pregnancy and I loved it then.  We just found out we're pregnant again so I started doing the workouts the other day and I still love them.  She repeats the moves plenty of times so you can keep up with her and the other ladies in the video.  There's plenty of trimester variations, so there's always something you can do.  The video is split up into two 20 minute segments,(one salsa and one yoga fat burn), which works perfect for me.  I just put my son down for a nap and I have time to squeeze in a quick workout, and a nap too!!  There's also a labor and delivery prep segment, and a stretch and relax segment.  I love both her pre- and postnatal videos and I would recommend getting these if you're considering a pregnancy workout video.",1225324800,,773,4.2534246575342465
8093592,2,B000BWPDFO,"I have the prenatal work out. I didn't get much of a work out from it- and it was very irritating that she pronounced ""salsa"" incorrectly (""salZZZA"").",1221350400,,150,4.592592592592593
8093593,5,B000BWPDFO,"I really enjoy this workout. I didn't workout with my daughter and didn't lose the baby fat, so I thought this time I'd give it a try. I've never done Yoga or Salsa dancing and I've picked up on it just fine. They are actually quite fun. I have not tried the Postnatal workout yet because I'm only 5 mon pregnant, so I'll have to get back to you on it.",1172102400,2,352,3.971830985915493
