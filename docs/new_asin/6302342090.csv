8180501,5,6302342090,"The last, I believe, of The Ring Cycle.  Performed in the opera house built by Wagner's patron solely for performances of the composer's  ""music dramas"", as he called his operas.  This work has all the attributes of his finest productions:  strong story line wth willful characters, appropriate costuming and staging, and good voices.  This Met production is essential for your viewing and hearing.",1420675200,,398,5.253968253968254
8180502,5,6302342090,"I'm not sure what's going on here but all of the other reviews are for different productions.  This blu-ray is for the Metropolitan Opera's 2012 production of ""Siegfried.""  The cast is led by Jay Hunter Morris as Siegfried, Deborah Voigt as Brunhilde and Bryn Terfel as The Wanderer.  Fabio Luisi is the condutor.

This is the famous ""machine"" production by Robert LePage.  Jay Hunter Morris is an excellent Siegfried.  His voice is amazing, and he brings a joy and energy to the role that I have not seen in other productions.  He's a very authentic Siegfried; not a bully or dunce like other interpretations.  Blu-ray includes a behind-the-scenes extra of Morris' rise to stardom (he was the cover until the original Siegfried became ill) and the interviews that took place when the production was broadcast in movie theatres.

If you've been intimidated by the Ring Cycle like I was, give this production a try.  It's a compelling and fun opera; comedic moments combined with wonderful romance.  Check it out!",1365206400,5,1012,4.928994082840236
8180503,4,6302342090,"This was a very grand production of Seigfried.  Master Levine does an incredible job as conductor and his interpretation of Wagner is grand. I do not think the production is dull.  The lighting is a bit dark at time, but I think that James Morris is superb as the Wanderer.  As expected a very good Metropolitan Opera performance.  This completes the Ring Cycle for me.",1023062400,6,369,4.630769230769231
8180504,4,6302342090,"I disagree strongly with the reviewer who complained that this production is ""dull"".  It is rescued from dullness by Heinz Zednik, the genius who plays Mime, and by fantastic sets.  Also, James Morris is at his peak as the Wanderer, totally convincing visually and vocally (except for his American accent) and he's the only one I've heard so far who can sing the line: ""Ha-ha, ha-ha,  ha-ha-ha-ha, der witzigster bist du ..."" with all the ""ha""s  correctly timed.  Everyone else--especially Hans Hotter--consistantly screws up this line, even in studio recordings.

Ekkehard Wlaschiha hits a homer as Alberich.  Superbly menacing as he threatens the Wanderer and a  great bully when he fights with Mime over the treasure.  He is not dark and dense; his voice doesn't punch you as some do, but his high notes are excellent.",959558400,29,821,4.977941176470588
8180505,5,6302342090,"Although Jerusalem is not well-done, but none of the production from the MET is not GREAT,the scenery,well,was terrific and the last scene, I can only use the term ""perfect"" to describe that!",941587200,2,191,5.0
