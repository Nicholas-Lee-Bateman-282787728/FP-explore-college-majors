8583891,5,B00CO8AFRE,"There is no pretension in this movie other the one to entertain the viewer and it succeeds as a lovely movie.
I found that the movie was a little too short and there were a few times when we wouldn't quite get the gist of what was happening: it's only a 1:30 movie.
I understood that Mitterrand gave her a brand new edition of the old book of recipes he was reading in his youth, but it is not clear.
A funny quirk: She always says aloud what she is doing while cooking.
This is not a biopic so many of the details have been invented and do not apply to the person who inspired this movie.

8583892,4,B00CO8AFRE,"I have more of a question than a review. I saw this film on a flight from Paris to Toronto. It was in French but subtitled in English. I would love to buy 2 copies of this film but for relatives but it has to have English subtitles. Are those not possible? how did the airline get them then? also I understand that the DVD is in region 2 because it was marketed in France. But don't they also want to market it in Quebec or Guadeloupe or Martinique which are zone 1?? I want to buy these as a gift but i have to find them adapted to zone 1 DVD players and with English subtitles.... Can anyone help me please??
thank you!!",1386633600,,622,4.024193548387097
8583893,4,B00CO8AFRE,"Inspired by a true story of Danile Delpeuch, who was a personal chef for French president Franois Mitterrand for two years, French comedy drama Les saveurs du Palais (aka Haute Cuisine) shows us how cooking can change your life in an unexpected way. The film suffers from heavy-handed narrative structure, and is reticent about several aspects of her job, but the star Catherine Frot almost single-handedly carries the film, as the heroine whose personality and professionalism is the greatest asset of the film.

Catherine Frot (Chaos A Page Turner) is Hortense Laborie, a chef working at the French base at the Crozet Islands. Her one-year contract is about to end, and she will be leaving the sub-Antarctic islands. This alone is already impressive, but her career is much more extraordinary, as back in France Hortense was working at the lyse Palace, cooking all the meals for the President (Jean d'Ormesson) and his guests.

The film goes back and forth between two narrative threads, one set in Paris and the other in the Crozet Islands, but I don't see the point of telling her great story in this way. Director Christian Vincent (The Discreet The Separation) has carefully removed political things from the story, and the president (played by writer Jean d'Ormesson) looks more like a schoolteacher than a politician. The medical condition of Mitterrand, who had a cancer, is only vaguely suggested.

Les saveurs du Palais is still an enjoyable film with effective supports from Hippolyte Girardot and Arthur Dupont. The film is as light as a souffl, and fun to watch.",1384560000,,1576,5.00763358778626
8583894,5,B00CO8AFRE,"'Haute Cuisine', or 'Les Saveurs du Palais', is the charming and heartwarming story of the personal chef, here named Madame Hortense Laborie (Catherine Frot), of the President of France, Francois Mitterand (Jean d'Ormesson).  Beginning while she is presently cooking on an island off Antarctica although mainly concentrating on her time while spent in Paris, France, in the late 1980's.  Hortense is the perfect blend of a woman's ambition, talent, and grace as the movie bounces back and forth between the two very different places and positions.

From the Perigord region of France, this movie moves swiftly with Hortense being whisked away in a very secretive fashion;  not knowing exactly of her destination.  She was only telephoned the previous day by the Ministry of Culture which vaguely explained that they were looking for a woman to cook for an important Senior Official.  Finally meeting up with her contact person, she is unknowingly taken to n33 which is The Palace Elysee in Paris.  Hortense is to be the Official Cook to Le President, to handle all of his meetings with personal friends and his staff.

She doubts from the very start that she is the right person for such a position as she has learned to cook simply, homespun and regional dishes from her mother and 'Granny'.  Lovely homemade recipes, named after her family (especially Granny), using the ingredients from her own garden is the family style repertoire brought along with her.  Hortense is reassured ""that's precisely what the President wants"".  Now she must relocate to the palace residence leaving behind her beloved farm, livestock and way of life.  The rules for having this new position in the Rue de l'Elysee are, at first, rigid and need to be strictly adhered to; direction, decorum, etiquette and standing.

The head chef, sous chef, and other staff from the Main Kitchen refuse to acknowledge her upon introduction, or to work harmoniously along with her.  She is a lone woman within a sea of uppity, stuffy, and pretentious men in white coats.  The pastry chef, Nicolas (Arthur Dupont), receives an instant promotion becoming her ""second"" and works like clockwork alongside her in the private Personal Kitchen.  He is an amiable and sweet young man, an opposite of all the other chefs, who then eagerly acclimates Hortense to her new culinary surroundings along with the devices she hasn't seen or used before.  While her new found title carries the weight of the world, she must perform precisely, detailed and exactly.  Without a moment's loss in following the order, she finds herself extremely important and endeared by the President; swiftly garnishing his favor while sharing a mutually friendly ideology of cooking and home-cooked recipes which spark his memories.  Talking openly about ""recipe books"" and their childhoods, the two enjoy each other while diplomats wait expectantly at the President's closed door.

The entire film is a visual feast with its photography (Laurent Dailland), the vibrant and colorful food leaps right off of the screen. The swollen landscapes are vivid and completely lovely while combing the countries, experiencing The Palace of Paris, and examining plentiful dinner tables. Along with the 'heavily inspired' screenplay, adapted from the book by Daniele Mazet-Delpeuch herself (Hortense Laborie in the film), director Christian Vincent adds a beautifully orchestrated soundtrack (Gabriel Yared).  To the tune of ""Auld Lang Syne"", and her recollections of finding the perfect truffles, you will fall in love with Hortense and her endearing story ... Bon Appetit!",1384041600,5,3595,5.206597222222222
8583895,4,B00CO8AFRE,"What a truly lovely film about food and the politics of a woman cooking for the President of France. It is told in flashback from the Antartica, where the woman who cooked for the President is now cooking for a group of scientists

Danile Delpeuch, was a family cook and restaurant-owner, who in the late 1980s was asked by President Franois Mitterrand to be his personal cook at the Elyse Palace. Danile's name for this film is Hortense, and she is played by the lovely Catherine Frot.  Hortense is met by fierce resistance from the all dominated male main kitchen, they are rude and sexist to her. She refuses to eat meals with them, and chooses the menus and foods she wants to prepare. She has a pastry assistant assigned to her, and they bond over the food they prepare. The President wants traditional regional cuisine he remembers from his youth.

We see Hortense discussing food and cookbooks with the President while dignitaries wait to meet with him. Hortense learns from Pres. Mitterrand to read the cookbook and recipes out loud, and she does this for the rest of her life. Everything goes along very well for a year or more until the President has health problems that require no fat, no sauces, few spices and in reality good plain food. At the same time Hortense develops a stress fracture of her hip which requires rest. She resigns and life moves on.

We find her again cooking for the scientists on Antartica for a year. The money is good and she wants to start a truffle farm in New Zealand. The scientists love her cooking and love her. She is a force to be reckoned with. We end up loving her, too. A strong, lovely woman who knows good food and how to cook it.

8583896,4,B00CO8AFRE,"""Haute Cuisine"" (95 min.; 2012 release from France; original title ""Les Saveurs du Palais"" or ""The Flavors of the Palace"") brings the fictionalized story of Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch who served as the personal cook of President Mitterand in the late 80s/early 90s. As the movie opens, the Delpeuch character is portrayed as Hortense Laborie, a chef from the Perigord region in south-central France, who apparently is now stationed in the Crozet Islands near Antarctica, where she is cooking for a small community of scientific researchers. We then go back in time as we see how 4 years earlier, she had gotten a call out of the blue from a top French bureaucrat that a ""senior French official"" wanted to hire her as his personal cook. When she eventually finds out that the position is to cook for the President of France, she wonders how he had gotten her name. In a later meeting President Mitterrand tells her that she came highly recommended by a close friend of his who had seen her cooking at some point. The rest of the movie cuts back and forth between her days as the Elysee Palace and the Crozet Islands, but focuses mainly on the tensions between Laborie and the much larger Main Kitchen crew also operating at the Elysee palace. To tell you much more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: the movie mentions not once, but twice (both in the opening credit and the closing credits), that it is 'loosely' based on the life of Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch, probably the reason why the main character is named differently, and perhaps also why the President in the movie looks nothing like Francois Mitterand. If you can get beyond this, the movie becomes a light-hearted French foodie comedy-drama, where indeed the French cuisine becomes the star of the movie, and the interoffice politicking between the President's personal cook and the Main Kitchen are just minor things in the big picture (at one point the regular Desert Chef blows up because he feels threatened and insecure, imagine that!). I am not a foodie as such, yet I couldn't help but marvel at all these French regional dishes. The role of Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch/Hortense Laborie is played beautifully by Catherine Frot, who deservedly was nominated for a Best Actress Cezar (the French Oscars). At just an hour and a half, this movie flew by in no time.

Imagine my surprise when this movie showed up unannounced and without any prior hype or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati last weekend. I was traveling then and I suspected that it would be gone very quickly, but when I saw it was still playing a week later, I went right away to see it. The screening where I was this at today was quite well attended actually, another surprise. Maybe this movie appeals to a lot of foodies and/or people interested in French movies. While this is not an ""important"" movie and it is very light-hearted, I might still suggest you check this out in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray, if the topic seems to be of interest to you.",1382227200,7,3098,4.74582560296846
