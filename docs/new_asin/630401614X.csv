764300,4,630401614X,"This movie proves again that love is more than a chemical reaction. It does not spell very much out for you. Sometimes it even seems to be just a string of single events. Yet the one thing that becomes clear in the end is that love exists in many different forms.
My only problem was the desciption written on the back of my video tape (not the one pictured above). The person who wrote that can not have understood the movie very well. They made Lytton Strachey look like a cruel man and Carrington like a ... It actually put me off watching it the first time I read it.",1030665600,4,571,4.2
764301,4,630401614X,"A young female artist falls in love with a known homosexual and the two spend their remaining years in each other's lives. No, this is not a romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts, but ""Carrington"" is an emotional drama that is a triumph for Emma Thompson and Jonathan Pryce, and less than perfect for writer/director Christopher Hampton.
The film is good. It takes place in the years 1914-1932 in England. Thompson is Dora Carrington, a troubled artist who falls for homosexual writer Lytton Strachey, played by Pryce. Strachey is a bit of a dramatic, suffering from ""old age"" and other infirmities, although he would be considered a young man. Strachey is first attracted to Carrington, thinking she is a young boy thanks to her pageboy haircut and lack of makeup.
The two fall in love the only way they can: unphysically. They share a bed, but have no real sexual relationship and pursue the kind of physical love they cannot find with each other. Virigin Carrington falls for an angry artist who cannot understand their four year relationship with no sex. She is simply not attracted to his body, but gives in anyway, finding she does not enjoy sex anyway. She breaks it off with him, using her impending cohabitation with Strachey as a reason. She then brings home uptight army soldier Ralph, played by Steven Waddington. He is a man's man who does not understand all these artists and conscientious objectors (to WWI), but beds Carrington and, the film implies, Strachey. Ralph and Carrington marry and Ralph brings home friend Gerald for Strachey to ""get to know."" Gerald then suddenly falls in love with Carrington. The two have an affair. Strachey finds and loves a younger man named Roger, and Carrington dumps Gerald, later finding a guy with a boat who really likes his sex on the high seas. Ironically, he is not sexually attracted to Carrington, the very reason she broke up with the angry young artist. Strachey and Carrington end up back together in their strange living arrangement, and both meet their fates.
Thompson and Pryce are so good here it hurts. The main problem I had was with Hampton's choice of subject matter. He based the film on a book about Strachey, titled the film after Carrington, and I kept noticing a real lack of focus as to the film's main character. Hampton also writes Strachey like he is a poor man's Oscar Wilde, coming up with pithy sayings in between heartbreaks. Carrington comes across as flighty and confused, but we do not see how disturbed she is until after Strachey's death, and Hampton could have elaborated on that a little more. More scenes about Carrington and Strachey's work might have helped as well. The two hour movie feels like compressed images from a long running soap opera. Why should the viewer care so much about these characters?
Hampton the director is wonderful. In one scene, Carrington sits on a stump and, through a giant bank of windows, watches her husband and his live in mistress, Carrington's own new lover, and Strachey and Roger, all getting ready for bed. Hampton keeps the scene sad without becoming voyeuristic, as Carrington seems to be silently questioning all these men who have brought her to this place in time. Carrington's death is also handled tactfully.
I would recommend ""Carrington,"" but with the reservations about the script. I definitely would recommend it on the performances alone, if nothing else.
This is rated (R) for mild physical violence, mild gun violence, profanity, some female nudity, brief male nudity, strong sexual content, strong sexual references, and adult situations.",1022803200,31,3587,4.9305785123966945
764302,3,630401614X,"Emma Thompson and Jonathan Pryce are likeable in their roles; and the best part of the movie were some delightful phrases -- to paraphrase : ""People in love should never live together, invariably one of two things happens -- they either fall out of love or they drive each other crazy.""  What I thought was supposed to be the strength of the movie -- a focus on their spiritual connection, a powerful platonic love, was never felt.  Pryce as Lytton said clever things, Thompson as Carrington looked furtively at him from time to time.  I would have been more convinced if I witnessed some joy they had in each other's company.  In life Lytton and Carrington must have been fascinating.  In this movie they were flat; emotions didn't seem restrained but non-existent.  I hoped for more.",1021334400,12,785,4.735294117647059

The story of Lytton Strachey and Dora Carrington, two characters you will never forget, will stand as one of the great love affairs of the last century.  That their's was not a sexual affair, only serves to expand our understanding of what love is and can be.

764304,2,630401614X,"This movie is about Dora Carrington's love life, and is effective in exploring it. Hoever, for those of us who knew of her as an artist and wanted to know more, it is disappointing. Her paintings don't even make it into the film until the final credits, where they seem to beckon one into a fascinating story that the film never told. Why did Carrington paint? What was in her heart and mind? How could a movie about an artist completely neglect her art? It doesn't tell the whole story at all. I was upset and annoyed at this. It's a pattern I've seen all too often, when the people making the movie seem more interested in who an artist or writer slept with than why and how they became great artists in the first place.
Emma Thompson gives the best performance I think anyone could have under the circumstances, but she (and Carrington) deserved a better script. I never felt as if I knew Carrington, because the art that meant so much to her was not part of the film.",996796800,18,971,4.370165745856354

The movie also gives a tantalizing glimpse of Ottoline Morrell,  so I hope someone will make a movie of her life, too (of course, Pryce will  have to come back to play L. Strachey again...).

Without spoiling anything, the film is generally about intellectuals in England who have utterly lost direction in life from 1915 to 1932.  I was constantly reminded of Aldous Huxley's 1920's novels but only in terms of world view rather than specific character or plot details.  This is the rare film that never excuses it's characters' flaws and destructive romantic arrangements but doesn't condemn them out of context either.  They simply lacked foresight.  Between the wars, it didn't seem that anyone was pressured or expected to follow the template of nuclear family.  Those with some financial means could live life by whatever momentary whims or artistic interests they chose.  Yet when these unconventional drifters are observed over the long term, some more conventional family arrangement would have obviously been the better choice.",1480636800,,1028,5.3875

764545,5,630401614X,"At first I was somewhat skeptical. Thompson was born in 1959 and Carrington was 21 when she fell for Lytton Strachy - but a kid.  One can read about it in Virginia Woolf's diary. But again ... Emma Thompson proves herself up to challenge - delivering an indubitably authentic performance as the enigmatic Carrington, more than twenty years her junior.  Considering the graphic sophistication of today's media audience, regularly bathed in representative imagery - no mean achievement. Both of the characters develop as they age and the story progresses, and the noted nuanced emotional complexity of the relationships seamlessly plays right into the players' wheelhouses.
The film is really first rate - but not mass audience fare - and one get's far more out of the viewing having previous knowledge of the peripheral characters and relationships (for instance, it has been verified that Lady Ottoline and Carrington at least slept together on a number of occassions)which the contraints of film do not allow to be developed. In fact the whole of Carrington's ""strong Sapphic"" predlictions are merely implied, not explored in the film.
The showing of her art during the closing titles - which is reminiscent of the end of original Modigliani (""Montpanarsse  - whatever the adress was)- was terrific - but feature film is all too constraining I think to explain such quintessential art and the drama which surrounds its production, no matter how great the efforts made, great as many of them are here...",1356480000,4,1503,5.1016260162601625

A stronger script would have made it even better, but realistically speaking, the characters must have written and painted better than they spoke - we know that much of creative people! A touching and memorable indication of the fact that even people full of talent and potential can lead lives of infinite sadness and confusion. More could have been made of Carrington's art, in a visual work such as this, I felt. The subtle use of the famous Strachey portrait was well done.

Their affection was genuine, and the limits to their relationship was obvious to all.  Others have said that this film is a one-note film; that unrequited love would be unfulfilling to each.  Her treatment to the other man in her life is sometimes difficult to bear.  She hurt her first love because she was afraid of hurting him, of course hurting him even more.

Dora Carrington was not a perfect person, of course, but her kind relationship with the gentle Lytton Strachey was sympathetic and winning.

764630,5,630401614X,"""Carrington"" portrays a love story between artist Dora Carrington and Lytton Strachey.  It is more than platonic, yet distinctively one without sexual intercourse.  Lytton is openly gay, yet is unable to deny how deeply he loves Carrington.  Carrington is in love with Lytton in an almost obsessive capacity, confessing her love to him while he does nothing to dissuade her.  In fact, his heart is obviously hers, despite his inability to desire her in a sexual way.  While they do share intimate embraces and kiss in the movie, never do they fully consummate their unique relationship.  Carrington embarks on numerous sexual affairs, marries one man (a young officer) who she ""shares"" with Lytton, and lives in torment that the only man she wants can love her in every way BUT a sexual way.  As in real life, Carrington and Lytton end up living together.  A poignant scene is when a sick and delirious Lytton calls out to Carrington, who's at his bedside.  He expresses his love and regret that he never married her, indicating his romantic love for her despite lack of physical desire for her body.

Jonathan Pryce is phenomenal in this movie as Lytton Strachey.  Behind the beard and the soft voice, one could hardly recognize him as the same man who played the villain in ""What A Girl Wants.""  Emma Thompson is endearing as a woman so in love with a man she is willing to bear a lot.

I like it because Lytton Strachey was a fascinating wordsmith, here played superbly by Jonathan Pryce. I like it because Emma Thompson plays Carrington. I like it because it is about Bloomsbury, an extended group of creative deviants who lived in interesting times and places. I like it because it is about love unto death conquering formidable obstacles--if love is what it was. Or was it dependence? You decide.

Although the subject matter includes pre-and extra-marital affairs as well as early twentieth-century British homosexuality (much different than American), this film has a sweet innocence to it that is entirely due to both Emma Thompson and Jonathan Pryce.

It's not for every Emma Thompson fan, but it is a wonderful movie about love.",1224115200,2,669,5.185185185185185

764634,4,630401614X,"This film, ""Carrington,"" displays just about all the virtues and faults of the Merchant-Ivory/Masterpiece Theater genre.  It is very earnest, very well acted and very pretty to look upon.  It's sometimes quite intelligent.  It is also very self-satisfied, very slow and very lacking in humor.  It's sometimes very dull, too.

The virtues are just that, virtues.  Cumulatively, they build up a lot of credit for this film.  The faults, depending on a viewer's personal values, may be regarded as lying somewhere on a scale ranging from irrelevant to fatal.  I lean to one extreme.  My wife leans to the other.

It might even be argued that the self-satisfaction, the humorlessness are neither more nor less than accurate depictions of Dora Carrington, Lytton Strachey and that whole self-absorbed, sexually-perplexed, navel-gazing crowd of twits at Bloomsbury.

I prefer to regard the director-writer, the actors and the whole production as hopelessly gullible in taking their real life protagonists at their own value.  The Woolfs, the Bells, Strachey and Carrington herself would, if given half a chance, express themselves as characters in a drama of high-flown aspirations and tragic consequences.  I, on the other hand, tend to view them as puppets in a French farce, albeit one written by D. H. Lawrence.

This film, its settings, its characters and its mind-set bear only the most tenuous connection with the real, tangible world.  As W.S. Gilbert might have put it, the film and all those in it yearn for Elysian fields, but ignore the fact that they ""can't get'em and would only let'em out on building leases"" if they had'em.  ""Carrington"" would be well served by the presence of just such a character as Fitzgerald threw in to add a spice of reality to the slow-simmering gumbo of Gatsby and Daisy and Tom: Nick, the narrator, doubter and conscience--a pallid character, yes, but still a whiff of the tax paying, traffic light-bound workaday world.

As a film, ""Carrington"" is easy on the eye.  Its story is interesting enough, although I can't imagine being drawn back to watch it of my own volition again at any time in the foreseeable future.  But even as I question the worth of making the film, I can't deny the high level of skill lavished on it.

I think ""Carrington"" is  a film worth seeing--once.  That's good enough for four stars as far as I'm concerned.",1188691200,2,2374,4.941919191919192
764635,4,630401614X,"This is a beautifully morose story of painter Dora Carrington; her work, her life, and the love of her life, author Lytton Strachey, who also happens to be homosexual. It is set in World War One England, and it looks as though the film itself could be a work of art. Carrington is full of saturated green landscapes and poetic dialog. Though a bit of a ""downer"", still worth a box of Kleenex and a month's prescription of Prozac.",1175558400,2,429,4.443037974683544
764636,4,630401614X,"'Carrington' belongs to the category of films that are obscure and eccentric, released in small art houses and that most people have never heard of. What a pity. This film presents an alternative twist on the theme of love, interweaving the ever-changing and amorphous desires of people and giving an honest portrayal of the ambiguous sexuality many people feel.

Jonathan Pryce and Emma Thompson team up in an on-screen romance that is both tragic and fulfilling. Lytton Strachey, cold, wise, and homosexual meets promising painter Dora Carrington. She insists on being called by her surname and is even mistaken for a boy by Lytton when he first sees her. Carrington is still a virgin and repels advances by men all the time, and it's driving her boyfriend Mark insane. In desperation, Mark begs that Lytton ""work on her a bit"". The relationship between Carrington and Lytton is untainted by lust, something Carrington has always objected to. She denies Mark sex because she fears that he will become only sexually interested in her.

Carrington, however, falls undeniably in love with Lytton, which is a slight inconvience considering the fact that he is gay. Still, they begin living together and spend some of the happiest years of their life. A touching moment occurs when Lytton asks Carrington, ""Why are you so good to me?"" and she replies by showing him the pen wiper which has the words ""Use Me"" on it. But alas, it must end in tragedy. The parting shot (and sound) of the film is so poignant that it left tears in my eyes.

Emma Thompson carries this film entirely on her shoulders. If not for her performance, this film would not be half as enjoyable. Just watching this woman in front of the camera is absolutely fascinating. Combine that with the idiosyncratic Jonathan Pryce and a wonderful supporting cast and the mixture is very much appropriately off-beat and quirky.

Definitely recommended and a must-see for Emma thompson fans.",1142035200,5,1948,4.911854103343465
764682,4,630401614X,"It's an odd thing when a film is perfectly cast, painstakingly researched, extraordinarily well-written, and wonderfully acted, that still it should feel a bit lifeless, stolid and conventional, completely unlike the characters it's illuminating. Look-alike Jonathan Pryce as the homosexual Lytton Strachey and the always remarkable Emma Thompson as the passionately heterosexual (Dora) Carrington act their hearts out, bringing vividly and with complete believability to life one of the oddest couples in recent history, but while Christopher Hampton has made his reputation on excellent writing such as we see here, his direction is leaden, and the film is interesting more for the work of the actors and the real people they play, rather than from any great feat of filmmaking. Sadly, not many people saw the film in the theatres despite the achievements of the cast.

Dora Carrington, though a painter of note, was most famous for her life-long, rather self-abasing devotion to Lytton Strachey, the writer of a number of essays and criticisms, who later published a witty expose of four ""Eminent Victorians,"" which was subersive and significant, both literarily and financially. But like many of the Bloomsbury set to which he and Carrington more or less belonged, he was arguably more remarkable for his eccentricity, wit, and whimsical personality than for a rather slender body of brilliant writing. Pryce's portrayal of him is delightfully unrestrained and flamboyant--when he and Ottoline dance at a party, they are a pair of absurdist clowns, having a marvelous time with no concern for anyone else`s opinion.  Carrington was his devoted and loving but non-sexual partner (she once described herself as his pen-wiper, there to serve him, asking nothing in return), and between them, at first through her selflessness, then through his own recognition of the rarity of this devotion, there grows a love deeper than most marriages.  Sexual passion is something they both choose to deal with independently, and surrounding themselves with lovers who somehow also manage to (mostly) rise above sexual jealousy, they live happily together almost from initial meeting to their deaths.

Her early life gave no clue that she would become such a committed non-conformist. After her graduation from the Slade School of Fine Art in London and the winning of a number of prizes, she was considered a painter of great promise, and became indeed, a quite prolific and interesting painter, but one who never even sought to show her work, despite much interest. Instead she painted to satisfy herself and others, and filled her homes with countless paintings (most famously her portrait of Lytton), especially portraits of friends and lovers, as well as covering every wall and piece of furniture with glorious scenes, delighting everyone who visited.

The two were introduced by Virginia Woolf's sister, Vanessa Bell (Janet McTeer), while Carrington was visiting her and, dressed in men's clothing with her hair shorn in a Dutch boy's bob, she was mistaken by Lytton for a boy--his dismay at learning that the ""lovely boy"" romping with Nessa's sons is a young woman is amusing. At first Carrington detested him, but they spent a great deal of time with Lady Ottoline (so brutally lampooned by D. H. Lawrence in ""Women in Love,"" she is treated here with great affection). The up-and-coming painter Mark Gertler (played by Rufus Sewell with his usual vigor and intensity), has enlisted Lytton's help in his quest to seduce the reluctant virgin he has spent four years pursuing, so the two are much thrown together and soon discover that they are born soul mates, feeling a great ease and openness with one another.

Eventually they decided to live together, with Carrington doing all the work to transform their first small house into a magical realm, while Lytton supported them with his earnings from the sudden, unexpected success of  ""Eminent Victorians."" They lived in perfect harmony, despite the fact that her physical passion for this man had to be diverted into relationships with other men. She married a man with whom Lytton was more in love than she, and though Rafe Partridge (Steven Waddington) did not requite Lytton's physical passion, he became a steady third in their lives with all three eventually owning their most famous home, Ham Spray House, together. Eventually a fourth was added to the family, when Rafe fell in love with another woman,  Frances (Alex Kingston), who managed to fit herself into the household, too (after Carrington`s death, they married). Throughout their years together, both Lytton and Carrington had many lovers, most of whom remained constants in their lives. Several were with him when he died of a sudden and fatal illness, which devastated Carrington. Though stories of her un-witnessed end vary, due to the need of others to try to protect her reputation, what we see in the film is  accurate in itself--what happened over the next couple of days is the time about which there are several accounts.

Carrington's generous and loyal nature endeared her to everyone she knew, and she and Lytton were a happy if unusual couple. Thompson plays her with intelligence and a sort of glowing health and energy that seduces us; she lights up the screen, and despite the boyish dress and early gracelessness, her face is as clear and lovely as the summer sky and she utterly convinces us of Carrington's irresistible charm--that many men desired and loved her is hardly surprising. Just as Lytton's fragile frame and effeminate gestures would, in one less brilliant and magnetic, become difficult to live with, his kindness and humor more than make up for any of the extra work others have to do in order to ensure his comfort and security. Even the extra manly Rafe is tolerant of Lytton's slightly silly ways.  They all work hard--he is the delicate and difficult center of everyone's world, at least externally, but as we get deeper into the relationship, we see that without Carrington, he might very well have been lost to ill-health and a tendency to melancholia--she may appear to be the satellite revolving him, but a greater insight reveals that she is the solid rock upon whose stability he is entirely reliant.

The film does capture the feeling of camaraderie that the Bloomsbury artists shared, their refusal to participate in the horrors of World War I, their solidarity despite the constant intrigues and affairs, and gives us some insight into the process of making art, of being artists unafraid to live outside the constraints of society. But most of all, Hampton, Thompson, and Pryce seem to really understand this unique relationship that ran so deep--the two loved and understood one another to a degree rare in life, and they seemed to be aware of this great gift, treasuring it and keeping it strong. Between them there were no secrets, and while Carrington would have loved Lytton as a woman loves a man, she accepted that this wasn't possible, and poured all her passion for him into being his mother, his sister, his dearest friend, his truest companion. Lytton repaid her devotion equally, and allowed her to build around him a real family which supported and loved him, despite his naturally solitary nature.

The cast, the delightful dcor of the homes Carrington made chiefly for Lytton`s comfort, the beauty of Carrington's paintings (please be sure to sit through the end titles, when her paintings are displayed side by side with the credits), are the principle reasons to watch this film which is worth owning, as you'll enjoy it more than once, especially if you're an artist yourself. Even if you're not, you may find yourself wanting to grab a brush and turn an old table into a work of art. Despite Hampton's flawed direction, these two people who fashioned a deeply meaningful relationship despite what most would consider built-in ""limitations,"" are fully brought to life by Emma Thompson in the title role, with Jonathan Pryce firmly by her side, as solid and fascinating as Carrington and Lytton. On the cover of a biography of Carrington is a picture of the two together, outside of Ham Spray House; Thompson's glowing smile and Pryce's dandyish pose are perfect. So perfect are they, that only after I opened the book and read that it was a photo, not of the actors, but of Carrington and Lytton themselves, did I realize how perfectly captured they'd been. I think they would have been pleased to see themselves in this film.",1140566400,21,8504,5.039829302987198
764683,5,630401614X,"At first the temptation is to see the movie's focus on Carrington's life as a clever ploy to do a biography of her lover, the far more famous Lytton Strachey, but in the end, the movie is really about Carrington.

Like Lytton, she is emotionally unusual.  She waits until her mid-twenties to lose her virginity, and when she does, she finds she is subject to the unbridled passions of every lover who comes her way.  Only Lytton, who is openly homosexual, cherishes her the way she wants to be cherished, in ways that leave her free to live her own life.

He is her ultimate love.  She is his ultimate love.  Neither ever fully engage that romanace and yet being afar seems to keep their love for each other real and close.

Carrington is less a movie about an eccentric homosexual writer than it is a movie about a radical feminist who dares to be her own person.  She wants to be in charge of her own life, not the object of some one else's passion.  In the same way, she wants to paint and create a total living environment through which she can control her world, she wants emotional control over herself.

Lytton lets her do that, because his writing consumes him, and all his boyish lovers are transitory.  The amazing decorative arts effects she paints throughout their houses are reminiscent of the Bloomsbury Group in general, but, in the movie, they represent her will be be in charge of her environment.  She has no desire to display her work or sell it.  She paints her lovers' images to retain them as she remembers them -- without demanding control over them.  Only Lytton gives her the same space.

In Lytton's oddly removed love, she finds the one true love that lets her be.  While both Lytton and Carrington take other lovers, their relationship is the steadfast calm that guides both of them through storm tempests of hot passion elsewhere.

In the end, the movie Carrington is about Carrington.  Anything you take away from the film about Lytton Strachey is truly just background.",1137715200,6,2000,4.61756373937677

764686,3,630401614X,"I would like to go back for a moment and dig deeper into the idea of full circle. I caught this idea as I was watching this film, and I thought it was amazing the way the director showed this transition.  The first person, outside of Lytton, that Carrington falls for is a man who is only interested in a physical relationship. Although she claims she is not interested in him sexually, it is at this time in Carrington's life, she is interested in a man's mind, not what is under his pants.  She breaks off this relationship to live with Lytton, a man who can give her the intellect that she desires.  As Carrington grows older, she finds comfort in physical relationships.  In fact, the majority of this film is about physical relationships.  Carrington is never hesitant to jump into the arms of another man.  A part of me thinks that she is constantly trying to find another Lytton out there, but there is another part of me that says that she was just trying to get the physical from men, because she had the perfect man at home (Lytton of course).  So after being with a man that only wants to have a physical relationship, she jumps into the arms of a soldier. One that is great with the physical, amazing towards Lytton, and perfect for Carrington.  As this comes to a surprising end, we see her jump into a relationship that was purely sexual. There was no interaction between the two except for when they were on his boat having sex.

Carrington experiences the best sex of her life with this man, but it again ... much like the others ... comes to a complete halt when he tells her that he is not really interested in her sexually. Odd, isn't how this films started with Carrington and her first boyfriend. We have come full circle.

If we were to look at this film in a symmetrical angle, we would notice a circle outside with Lytton in the direct center of this circle. The circle would represent Carrington's life. All around the circle would be the men that she has been with, while Lytton would be her stability point. All throughout her encounters with other men she always is able to find comfort with her center figure ... Lytton.  If you watch this film closely, you will notice that there is only one point in the movie where Carrington goes outside the circle.  It is when she is having a party at her house.  Carrington goes outside only to sit down on a stump that happens to be facing the house.  She is able to see all the windows in the house, and all of her past lovers with their new ones.  Even Lytton with his new boyfriend.  This is the moment that we see Carrington thinking about her life. Seeing what she has been a part of, and watching it somewhat crumble down. This is her only moment outside of the circle that she has built. Lytton is the foundation to this circle, and it is obvious that without Lytton everything around Carrington must crumble as well.

That my friends, is how you build a love story.

764687,4,630401614X,"Carrington, a female painter, falls in love with the gay author Lytton Strachey, and together they create a relationship without boundaries.  This boundless love leads Carrington into several love affairs with other men, but it does not wreck Carrington and Lytton's strong affection for one another.  Unconditionally Carrington displays her devotion and respect for Lytton who is reciprocal in his loyalty to their relationship.  However, the other men in Carrington's life are not as understanding as Lytton as they demand something in return for their love for Carrington.  It is these demands that prevent Carrington from developing her other relationships as she has done with Lytton.

764688,3,630401614X,"Here is a competent film which focuses on the unusual Bloomsbury  relationship between Carrington and Strachey between the Great war and 1932.
The two principals are exceptionally fine, especially Pryce as Strachey whose movement, mannerisms and acerbic gentleness establish wonderfully this memorable eccentric.  Several supporting roles are capably done.
Unfortunately I found the film seriously undermined by Michael Nyman's music, which is obtrusive, jagged and insistently repetitive. On three occasions it makes way for the supremely beautiful slow movement of the Schubert string quintet, but the aural abuse returns each time, including during the credits.

I had to view this film more than once to appreciate it.  After all, I felt it should be called 'Lytton' instead of 'Carrington.'  This is probably because this film was based on Lytton's biography and not Carrington's.
In fact, Carrington had many affairs according to an interview with Emma Thompson and some were with women but of course, there wasn't time to put all that on film.

764690,4,630401614X,"There is probably some profoundly deep irony to the idea that the writer Lytton Strachey was informed by Virginia Woolf that the ravishing young boy he had his eye on was really a woman, the painter Dora Carrington, but it remains outside of my grasp at this point.  However, I am not surprised that this story of a profound platonic love between two people is taken from the pages of history, because Hollywood is rarely inclined of the consummations it routinely wishes (remember, the classic tale of Cyrano de Bergerac comes from a play and was not written directly for the screen).
Strachey, Carrington, Woolf and most of the other characters in this 1995 film were members of the Bloomsbury Group, all of whom were eccentric British geniuses who explored the dynamics of human relationships in strange ways when they were not busy exorcising their artistic impulses.  In a masterful understated performance Jonathan Pryce plays Lytton, who was a quiet, dry witted, reserved homosexual in his thirties when he met Carrington, played by Emma Thompson, who was 15 years younger and still a virgin.  Their first meetings and the strange attraction that would bind them for the rest of their lives are sketched out in the first several scenes.  The explanation for why they would live together while loving others is developed throughout the rest of the film.  What becomes clear is that no matter who Lytton and Carrington took into their respective beds, or shared between them for that matter, no one mattered more to them.  Ultimately, the tragedy of their relationship is not the absence of the physical dimension, but, as is often the case with most relationships, the failure of both to articulate the depth of their feelings to the other until fate cruelly rectifies that error.
Thompson's character is on a par with the other victims of unrequited love she has played with great success in ""Howard's End"" and ""The Remains of the Day.""  Writer-Director Christopher Hampton, working from Michael Holroyd's book on Lytton Strachey, expands her character through Carrington's art: she must have painted every corner of Ham Spray House, where they lived in Berkshire.  She is the film's title character, not only because she survives Lytton, but because after they met and became friends (pure understatement, I assure you) she continued to pursue other interests and people while he was remarkably contempt to enjoy those she brought into their small circle.
Still, it is Pryce's Lytton who is the captivating character.  Like most British eccentrics he was a natural epigramist, but with a great sense of restraint, picking his moment for his one rapier thrust (even if it is on his own death bed).  Carrington is the one who actively engages in the acts of intimacy between them while we have to remind our selves that Lytton's passive acceptance of it is out of a sense of propriety and not a lack of deep feelings.  I have always had a strong affection for love stories that never enter the realm of the physical (is there a sexier scene in movies that the dance in ""The King and I""?), and ""Carrington"" is a film in that tradition, especially for those with an affection for British period dramas.",1066953600,10,3206,4.8966789667896675
