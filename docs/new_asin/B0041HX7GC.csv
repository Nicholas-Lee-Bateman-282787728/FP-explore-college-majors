8455731,5,B0041HX7GC,I have been following the yoga-slackers since starting to slackline in 2008. They make great vidios and are always challenging themselves. This video will help you to challenge yourself.,1373155200,,186,5.448275862068965
8455732,3,B0041HX7GC,"I'm not entirely displeased with this item, as it has two levels of yoga classes to develop your skills to do acro yoga, plus a ""workshop"" chapter for strength training exercises. However, I can take a regular yoga class anywhere- I bought this because I've moved to an area where partner yoga is not accessible. I am disappointed because I was expecting a DVD teaching how to actually do acro yoga with a partner, and there is absolutely none of that on here. The only ""acroyoga"" is a montage performance by the teachers at the end. Not at all what I thought I was buying, but if you want classes you can do on your own, its great.",1329523200,12,632,4.364406779661017
