8444814,1,B004WB0S1O,"I loved the original Paranormal Activity movie and I liked the sequels as well.  So when I found this movie as an unofficial sequel to the first movie, I knew I had to check it out.

However this film was just so boring that I sometimes felt like I was going to fall asleep during the movie.  There was just so little going on and it was just these people talking and attempts to duplicate the film making style of the original movie. Which included the fast forwarding of the footage, the slow off balance walk of the main actress, and some of the same sound effects.

If you liked the original movies that involved Katie, you can skip this one, it is a pale imitation of the original movie it is supposedly a sequel of.",1412467200,2,721,4.279411764705882
8444815,1,B004WB0S1O,"What a waste of my money. This French version of the film clearly states it has english subtitles on the back of the cover. And yet upon putting the movie in the player, my choices are Japanese or French. No English at all. And none of the reviews mentioned this little oversight either.

So be warned.",1394928000,5,302,4.392857142857143
8444816,3,B004WB0S1O,"I believe the filmmakers intended this to fit within the same universe as the first paranormal activity, but once paranormal activity 2 came out, the mentioned events in this movie relating to the first paranormal activity were I'm sure ignored. Despite that, this movie works well. It's a slow-burn with a solidly horrific ending. What seems to work for foreign horror to american audiences is the inherent strangeness in cultural differences. The movie creates an ominous setting right from the start. If you can get a copy of this, watch it alone, in the dark, late at night.",1331510400,,578,4.908163265306122
8444817,4,B004WB0S1O,"Paranormal Activity Tokyo Night is partly a continuation of the story in the first Paranormal Activity movie, and partly a Japanese remake of said film. Originally this movie where called paranormal Activity 2 and the story takes place between the events of the American Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Activity 2. Tokyo Night is about a young Japanese woman named Haruka who comes come to her family's rural home after a car crash which have bound her to a wheelchair for six months. Haruka's younger brother Koichi have to take care of his sister while she heals as their father is constantly way on business tips. Koichi have a passion for video cameras and he makes home movies, so when strange things start happening in the house he decided to film it.

Tokyo Night go back to the same formula as Paranormal Activity 1, the effects are subtle, the acting kept natural and there is no soundtrack to speak of. The movie do feel like some home movie which adds to it's atmosphere and creepiness. I think it is safe to say that if you enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity movie then you will like this one, but if you did not care for the first film then this is not likely to appeal to you. Tokyo Night moves slowly, building up the mood until a simple drinking glass cracking is as scary as any blood and guts scene in other movies. Acting wise I do not think the actors where fantastic, the movie do feel a bit stiff at times, but their performance works well enough. Paranormal Activity Tokyo Night is a creepy movie and it is actually rather effective as a horror movie.

Now Tokyo Night is presented as a sequel to paranormal Activity but I would say it is more of a remake, some scenes and situations are taken right from the original movie and this is more taking the original concept for the franchise and giving it a Japanese feel, lucky though there is no idiot husband here, a character which I really hated in the first movie. Tokyo Night is a remake done right, it takes the original concept but add enough new material to make it fresh, new and exiting.

I enjoyed Paranormal Activity Tokyo Night, it is a slow, atmospheric movie which really do feel like a home movie. I recommend this to any who like the paranormal Activity series, who like haunted house movies or who are into Japanese horror. Also I am generally not scared by horror movies but some of the scenes in this really creeped me out, and it takes allot to do that. Thumbs up to Paranormal Activity Tokyo Night.",1322179200,3,2496,4.529933481152994
