8363915,5,B002CE9CP6,"This film is a spoof of how the last dictatorship from the CCCP (USSR) days is still operative (even though Belarus is probably leaning or thinking about leaning more toward the west.  A strange dance ""waltz"" of the son of a Nazi collaborator shunned by the common folk and the govt , he keeps trying to redeem his family name by trying to go back toh the pre soviet and pre nazi days by stageing one man demonstrations in the public center of major cities, where he is usually arrested and then set free after a small time.  HIs story is his Father only collaborated so he could be in a better position to ""help"" his countrymen... like a mole or double agent.
  Anyway, its a very straight and real insight into the acutal scenery, attitudes, social economic fabric , even right down to the ""style "" of how their  very cemetaries are and look.  ther cusoms, folk music, etc are all very actually real...  Its like a in your living room walk around tour of Belarus inside story,  and I can vouch that much of the customs, scenery, are very very similar to their DEMOCRATIC neighbor Ukrain to the south.  Its almost too real... as it make people from those areas very nostalgic and even may bring a tear or two...  I hope the man in the film gets a better deal in his next life.  Bless you all  !  Jesus doesn't look at your country but at YOU and what your values are.",1425168000,,1368,4.317647058823529
8363916,1,B002CE9CP6,"As someone who came from Belarus this guy starts off nice and all but as you hear from his family he is just a horrible human who follows extreme nationalism, one interview especially highlighting it. When he comes to see his former lover and who has a daughter by him.
She highlights his behaviour towards her and her daughter which is best described as A#43le. Examples she highlights - being pregnant with his child (they already broke up) and meeting him and his new girlfriend at movie theater, he helped his girlfriend with her bag - a bit heavy and ignored her - heavy with his child!
when little girl was 6 she made a home-style art gallery of her pictures, he was invited and refused by saying: ""I leave you alone why are you bothering me?""
Ending with him getting married to his wife and calling her and asking her for her blessing - imagine the nerve! She said it kind of shocked her that he called for her blessing and didn't even apologize or anything.

His answer - well you are Russian, if you were a Belrussian girl I would have taken care of you and apologized and all, but you are Russian, why are you here and not in Russia go back to Russia.
(FYI: She move to Belarus possibly to go to school/work etc over 27 yrs ago when it was still USSR)

Imagine if someone from Georgia moved to Wisconsin and had the same treatment or even French who work in Britain or vice versa.
This guy is not a hero or opposition member to Lukoshenko, he makes Lukoshenko seem like a nice guy. I shudder to think what he would be if he was a President - new Nazi party?",1395792000,,1567,4.29054054054054
8363917,3,B002CE9CP6,"I'm not a professional film reviewer and the following is my opinionated review of the film's contents. My qualifications are limited to having vacationed several times in Belarus, being married to someone raised in Belarus, and having relatives in the country.

The film definitely is neither black or white. You do not know whether to like or dislike the 'hero' character. While the central figure was generally telling the truth about the Country's history and culture, he is an ultra-nationalist and presents an exaggeration of the situation in Belarus.

If you're interested in this movie because you want to gain a better understanding of the sociopolitical situation in Belarus, you may want to look elsewhere.  This is a short venture into the life of an artist where he shares some of his beliefs, his personal life, a little history of Belarus, and you also happen to view some of the cultural events occurring while the movie was being filmed.",1258502400,,954,4.987421383647798
