Cloris Leachman was much more fun in the recent ""Dancing with the stars"", I loved her in that!!  Car buffs will LOVE THE CARS,  but CRINGE at the number of classic 1950s machines destroyed and maimed (including a RARE 1960 EDSEL) to make this low budget back-row-of-the-used-car-lot quality filler.  ---  Sorry Charlie,  just once I'de like to see a movie of this type without having to see the old cars wrecked.

1690311,3,B000063K0P,"I just saw ""Crazy Mama"" yesterday on a theatre (actually, not a commercial theatre but the Lisbon Cinemateca).

The movie is a lot of fun, a good ""road movie"", and clearly Demme has talent and avoids many of the technical or stylistic ""pitfalls"" that are unfortunately common on 70's cinema (hand-held camera, zoom, etc).

Tha actors are well directed and the humour is kept on a restrained level, without over-the-top performances or situations that would be easy to do in a movie of this type.

What intrigues me is the format issue.  The DVD is not widescreen, and a viewer said it was ""pan-and-scan"".  But the fact is the copy I saw yesterday was not widescreen either, and visually it didn't look ""pan-adn-scan""!  And on IMDB, there is no mention to the picture's original format, but the DVD is referred to as ""pan-and-scan"".

Will anyone help me on this?",1115856000,4,861,4.738255033557047

1690320,5,B000063K0P,"The Lady in Red is one of Roger Corman's best movies, and is also one of Pamela Sue Martin's best performances, in my opinion.
I didn't watch Crazy Mama, which seemed like a typical car-crash flick.

The production values of The Lady in Red were good, and the movie gave a good idea of what life must have been like in Chicago during the Great Depression. I would recommend it to anyone who liked Johnny Depp in Public Enemies, which concentrated more on Dillinger and was closer to actual history.

  SPOILER ALERT!

The Lady in Red is not primarily about John Dillinger. Martin (Nancy Drew, Dynasty) plays a likeable and essentially decent young woman who does what she must to survive in a horrible situation. Her character is worthy of the young man (not Dillinger) who lays down his life for her, and I was glad that the movie's end seems to offer her the possibility of redemption.",1406160000,,887,4.5886075949367084
1690321,3,B000063K0P,"Produced by Julie Corman, and directed by Jonathan Demme (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000MGB6N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>), the low budget action/comedy Crazy Mama (1975) features a group of misfits travelling across the country in the late 1950's, engaging in a crime spree.

Cloris Leachman, an Academy award winner for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Picture-Show/dp/0767827902/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Picture Show</a>, plays Melba Stokes, who along with her mother Sheba (Ann Sothern, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maise-films/dp/B0080QOJSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maise films</a>), are the leaders of a clan, who have decided to leave California, and return to their family home in Arkansas.  Also along is Melba's pregnant daughter Cheryl (Linda Purl,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matlock/dp/B0012EM5EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matlock</a>), and her surfer boyfriend Shawn (Donny Most,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Days/dp/B000291Q3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Days</a>).  While in Las Vegas, Melba gets hitched to Jim Bob (Stuart Whitman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sands-of-the-Kalahari/dp/B004YCKJQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sands of the Kalahari</a>), and Cheryl picks up motorcycle riding drifter Snake (Leachman's son, Bryan Englund).  The trip back to Arkansas becomes an increasingly eventful adventure, as the group's criminal activities, draws the attention of law enforcement, culminating in a most violent crashing of a wedding.

Something of a road comedy with rural trash elements, Crazy Mama doesn't aim very high, as Melba turns to crime, in an attempt to find a better life for her family.  After a while, the yahoo behavior and overdone southern drawls can become a bit much, as these are not the most likeable bunch.  The violence and mayhem is handled well, and is mostly light hearted fun, but there are a couple of major exceptions, as not all of the motley crew manages to complete the journey.  Merie Earle is terrific as the oldest member of the gang, and Linda Purl is smoking hot, but Stuart Whitman probably doesn't give his most inspired performance.

The New Concorde DVD release is full screen, and isn't the greatest quality, but does include an informal conversation between director Demme, and the legendary Roger Corman, and the two men also contribute a down and dirty commentary track, loaded with neat tidbits.  Crazy Mama continues in the fashion of Corman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Bad-Mama/dp/B0042FUHUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Bad Mama</a>&nbsp;(1974).",1403308800,,2935,7.505813953488372

1690338,5,B000063K0P,"That's the question raised here in this awesome 2 disc set of Corman Classics released by Shout! Factory. The first film is 1976's Crazy Mama starring the surprisingly effective Cloris Leachman and a great cast including Linda Purl,Donny Most,Ann Sothern,Stuart Whitman and Tisha Sterling. The second film is 1979's The Lady in Red starring the lovely Pamela Sue Martin as the title character. The fine cast also includes Robert Conrad ,Louise Fletcher and Christopher Lloyd. Both films have a theme based on good people turning to a life of crime to achieve their goals. This theme is not uncommon in Roger Corman backed films as Great Texas Dynamite Chase,Smokey Bites the Dust,Eat My Dust and even later day fare like Streets have similar trademark themes. In Crazy Mama Melba Stokes played by Cloris Leachman is a hard working  single mom of a teenage daughter(Linda Purl) who also cares for her Momma (Ann Sothern) .When Melba was a young girl her Dad was murdered by the police in a corrupt town called Jerusalem Arkansas where the family was set up for eviction by a powerful businessman who wanted their property. So when history repeats itself and Melba falls behind on her rent landlord Jim Backus comes a calling to evict the entire Stokes clan from their beauty salon. So once again facing displacement what does Melba decide to do? hit the road and return to Jerusalem and reclaim the Stokes family property. Of course having no money becomes an issue so this leads them to a casino in Vegas to try and win some money. At the casino we meet Jim a handsome drifter who connects with Melba right away. Jim(Stuart Whitman) ends up marrying Melba in one of those only in Vegas quickie weddings even though he's still legally married back home in Oklahoma. Sheba Melba's mother makes friends with an elderly lady who left her retirement home for one last fling (Tisha Sterling)Also adding to this crew is Cheryl's (Purl) boyfriend(Most) who trailed after the family when the hit the road. And the last member of this rag tag crew is a greasy biker who is smitten with Cheryl and vies for her affections with Most. This group forms a tight bond and starts a crime spree that nets them enough money to make it to Arkansas and a final showdown in Jerusalem. The tone set by director Jonathan Demme is both fun and dramatic balancing silly scenes and humor with serious ones and drama. Leachman best known for tv work on shows like Mary Tyler Moore is really good playing Melba a character you could easily root against but end up rooting for instead. You can see where Demme earned his keep as a director as it's a high wire act between being humorous and serious all in one film. The 2nd feature The Lady in Red has no such qualms because it's 100% drama .Set in the roaring 1930's we first meet young Polly Franklin working the farm for her domineering Dad. Polly is played by another familiar tv face Pamela Sue Martin. Polly dreams of leaving for Hollywood and becoming a dancer .Instead she ends up witnessing a bank robbery .She ends up being questioned by the cops as she is briefly abducted by the robbers. Her father is irate when she returns home and beats her. Having had enough of his abuse and set to embark on her dreams she leaves for Chicago. Finding work at a sweatshop doing sewing work Polly tries to do right. She befriends Rose(Laurie Heineman) and they toil under the thumb of an evil boss(Veteran Corman player Dick Miller) .Rose crosses Miller's character and ends up getting arrested and sent to prison. Polly starts an uprising shades of Norma Rae here and is fired from the sweatshop. She tries her hand as a dime a dance girl. There she learns the real money is being made turning tricks instead of ""dancing"".Polly makes the mistake of soliciting a undercover cop and ends up in the same prison as Rose. Prison life is hard as the Matron is a beastly woman and takes sadistic delight in bullying especially Rose who's Jewish and the black inmates. Once again standing up for Rose (and herself) gets Polly into more hot water. The Matron besides being a brute and bully also furlough's inmates to a brothel run by a Romanian immigrant named Anna. Think of it as x rated work release as the Matron takes a cut. Anna takes a cut and Polly stays out of jail. Anna(Louise Fletcher) also has to deal with paying off the cops and local mobsters and arm breaker/brute Frog nose(Christopher Lloyd) .Those looking for Lloyd to be his Doc character from Back to the Future or Jim from Taxi will be in for a shock as Frog Nose is a vile character. Working for Anna are retired criminal Pops and piano player/singer Pine Top. Along the way Polly befriends a young would be thug Eddie(Glenn Withrow) and he joins Anna's employ as well. Well things go south when Frog Nose brutally murders one of the hookers and the cops shut down Anna's. What to do next? open a cafe using Pops,Polly,and Eddie as staff. Here's where Polly meets public enemy #1 gangster John Dillinger(Robert Conrad) .Thus begins Polly's final descent into the world of crime leading to a bank heist where Polly,Pops,Pine Top and Eddie rob a mafia fronted bank. Unlike Crazy Mama these characters are more ""real"" and the situations more serious than those in Crazy Mama. The film directed by Lewis Teague and written by John Sayles is well done. Again the writing and directing make you want to root for Polly and her friends where one could easily wish for Polly to meet her doom. In the end both films are very good but different. I absolutely recommend purchasing this 2 disc set as it's a great nights viewing.",1322870400,,5601,4.640483383685801
1690339,4,B000063K0P,"Here's two more crime chicks movies from the Corman factory(actually Julie Corman produced both films).
First off is Crazy Mama, which has Cloris Leachman as a hairdresser making the trek from California back home to Arkansas(or was it Alabama?) to reclaim the land that was taken from her years before.  Along for the ride are her mother, her daughter, a 75 year old refugee from an old folks home, her daughter's surfer boyfriend, a greaser hoodlum, and Leachman's love interest, Stuart Whitman.  The journey becomes a cross country crime spree as the gang find ways of robbing and stealing along the way.  The film takes place in 1958, but some of the songs on the soundtrack are at odds with that date, not that that's a big deal or anything.
Thee whole thing is played as zany comedy.  To be honest, I wasn't all that into it.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it was just too much of the women all yelling and throwing fits.  Plus the attempts at humor didn't really work for me.  I do prefer Corman's Big Bad Mama, which this is more or less a carbon copy of plot wise.
Next is The Lady In Red, and this is definitely the highlight of the disc.  This one follows Pamela Sue Martin as she flees home to Chicago in the 1930s, gets crap jobs, gets thrown in prison(with Beulah Balbricker herself!), works the brothel, becomes John Dillinger's girlfriend, and eventually becomes a butt kicking criminal herself.  It's a bit more serious in tone, but not afraid to be goofy when it allows.  Lots of good actors here. We have Louise Fletcher as the madame, Robert Conrad as Dillinger, Robert Forster as a mobster, and Christopher Lloyd in sadistic mafioso mode.
Very cool movie, very well done.
Extras are commentaries on both films, and an interview with Jonathan Demme and Roger Corman, however the Demme interview is how he met and came to work with Corman, but no mention of Crazy Mama.  But that's what the commentary is for, right?
Definitely worth it for The Lady In Red, though Crazy Mama is certainly worth your time.",1305936000,,2021,4.6016713091922

1690341,4,B000063K0P,"Shout! Factory continues its series of ""Roger Corman's Cult Classics"" with this grindhouse double feature, 1975's CRAZY MAMA and THE LADY IN RED from 1979.

If you were to look at these two pictures upon their release and predict which director would go on to make Academy Award winning movies, my guess is Lewis Teague (LADY IN RED) would get the nod.  In fact, CRAZY MAMA's Jonathan Demme brought home the top five pieces of Oscar gold (including one for himself) with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, as well as helming the Oscar-winning PHILADELPHIA and MELVIN AND HOWARD, one of the greatest comedies to ever peer into the heart of the American Dream.

But like so many others, Demme started his directorial career at the low-budget Roger Corman film school. CRAZY MAMA is a loosey-goosey genre mash-up, transporting Corman's earlier hit, BIG BAD MAMA, set during the Depression, into the 1950's, complete with AMERICAN GRAFFITI-style soundtrack of semi-obscure (and, I'm sure, cheap to get) Top 40 tunes of the era.

Cloris Leachman plays Melba, a Southern California hairdresser evicted from her shop by Jim Backus (that's right, Mr. Magoo/Thurston Howell III).  With her teenage daughter (Linda Purl) and her mother (Ann Sothern), Melba takes off for Arkansas to reclaim family land.  As their journey devolves into a minor-league crime spree, they're joined by surfer dude Shawn (Donny Most from HAPPY DAYS), pompadoured biker Snake (Bryan Englund), wisecracking old lady Bertha (Merie Earle), and married Texas sheriff Jim Bob (Stuart Whitman), who is only too happy to fall into a tempestuous affair with Melba.

The story and the filmmaking in CRAZY MAMA don't hang together all that neatly.  Rather than the R-rated exploitation fare Corman was known for in the 70's, it's more along the lines of silly, redneck road movies like EAT MY DUST.  In it, you can see the roots of the quirky heartland sensibility Demme would bring to his first ""studio"" film, HANDLE WITH CARE aka CITIZENS BAND.  But in this double feature, CRAZY MAMA is clearly the undercard.

The main attraction on this DVD is Teague's THE LADY IN RED.  Written by the estimable and prolific John Sayles, the story goes over ground cinematically covered before (DILLINGER) and since (PUBLIC ENEMIES).  Set in the Depression-wracked 1930's, Pamela Sue Martin (DYNASTY) plays Polly Franklin, who's driven from her rural home by her religious zealot of a father.  In Chicago, Polly lands a job as a sweat shop seamstress, where she befriends feisty, Jewish working girl Rose Shimkus (Laurie Heineman).  Resisting their sexually predatory boss (Corman stalwart Dick Miller), Polly and Rose eventually wind up in the same jail, where they are tormented by the matron Tiny Alice, played by the deliciously nasty Nancy Parsons.

Eventually, Tiny Alice ""sells"" Polly to a local brothel, which is run by Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher as the understanding madam, Anna.  Turning tricks and finding a caring family, Polly falls in love with one of the customers, unaware that he is the notorious criminal, John Dillinger (Robert Conrad).  Polly's fate leads her to inadvertently become the infamous Lady in Red, who tips the cops off to Dillinger's attendance at the Biograph Theater, where the feds gun him down.

Thanks to a smart script by Sayles and Lewis Teague's incisive direction, THE LADY IN RED is a snappy, entertaining movie.  The performances are generally terrific, with Pamela Sue Martin appealing and empathetic in the lead, and actors like Fletcher, Heineman and Conrad providing strong support.  The movie also hosts its fair share of nudity, sex and violence, which doesn't hurt its cause at all.  All in all, THE LADY IN RED shows what could be accomplished when intelligence and craft overcame the limitations of a small budget.",1299974400,,3803,5.090177133655395
1690342,3,B000063K0P,"DVD transfer:  Prensented in color, the transfer is very good.

Cloris Leachman and Ann Sothern combine for a lot more laughs and fun than Roger Corman's earlier ""bad woman"" film, 'Big Bad Mama'.  The release is rated PG without the nudity associated with the first film.  I liked this film as it follows the same plot as other Corman films on this subject but adds a lot of humor.  It is also based in the 1950's rather than the depression.  A great road trip movie which does have some violence.  Look for fine supporting roles from Stuart Whitman, Linda Purl and Danny Most.

The filnm owes much of its success to director, Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner for 'Silence of the Lambs').  Demme is just one of dozens of great filmakers and actors who got a chance to perfect their professions under Corman.

1690343,5,B000063K0P,"Just glad to see these Roger Corman classics getting the respect they deserve. CRAZY MAMA is one of the 'better' Corman films (thanks to good casting) that came out in the 70s and has never seen a good transfer to video. The movie itself is pretty good for Corman standards. Reminds me a lot of his GRAND THEFT AUTO and EAT MY DUST films, full of action without being R-rated violent and no nudity. Hard to believe Corman would release a film this tame in the 70s, most of his movies are exploitation flicks made for drive-ins. But finally Shout released this classic in anamorphic widescreen with commentary also! It is bare of really any other special features except the second feature THE LADY IN RED which is rated R (with nudity and violence)and anamorphic widescreen also. I am so glad that these old movies from the 70s are getting released from a good company that is doing justice to them. Even Corman's old Concorde label was putting his films out full frame and no special features. Just keep 'em coming Shout! Heard that GRAND THEFT AUTO/EAT MY DUST are getting released soon...can't wait! These movies are great buys if you can get 'em cheap enough.

7959268,4,B000063K0P,"This is more like a 4 1/2 star rating a very fun double feature of movies that is like a trip back in time to the 1970's when double features still existed.  One special feature for this CRAZY MAMA/THE LADY IN RED double feature is the ""grindhouse"" viewing which includes ""R"" rated Previews of other Roger Corman movies ""Caged Heat"" (looking really sex-ploitative, dirty, mediocre acted prison movie...did I mention ""fun"") as well ""Big Bad Mama"" (with,YES, a wonderful frontal shot of Angie Dickinson opening her button shirt to the voice of actor Tom Skerritt - in ""character"", I presume - stating very impressed for obvious ""Angie"" reasons, ""Oh, MAN!"").  It's a hoot (pun intended, I guess).  There is, also, THAT 70's kaleidoscope of color while THAT movie theater music plays introducing the ""upcoming attractions"" et cetera.  It's all crackly and grainy and kinda skips (on purpose) too.

And then the movies which is why I came back to this review 6 months later to re-emphasize just how entertaining this ""grindhouse"" viewing is, Especially, THE LADY IN RED!
Pamela Sue Martin (Poseidon Adventure; Nancy Drew) plays the lead in this surprisingly well detailed and ambitious (made for less than a million $$, 1979) Depression era gangster movie by Director Lewis Teague helped immensely by the screenplay of John Sayles.
As for Sayles he conspires with Roger Corman's wife and Producer Julie Corman to give an informative Commentary (special features are all good on disc) that includes many great ""research stories"" including Louis Armstrong leaving the country to escape Gangsters fighting over his contract; 1/3 of the women in Chicago by age 30  were hookers during Depression; and the reporter in LADY IN RED was based on actual reporter Al Capone had ordered killed!  Overall, the look and feel of this movie IS impressively authentic.
Pamela Sue Martin ""grows"" wonderfully in her role as innocent mid western girl who eventually dates the infamous John Dillinger (or is he Dillinger; again listen to Commentary too).  Lewis Teague (also directed underrated B-type movies Alligator with Robert Forster; and Fighting Back with Tom Skerritt..) gets good performances from Robert Conrad and Robert Forster as gangsters, but good men, with a not 'Doc Brown yet' Christopher Lloyd playing maniacal ""Frognose"".
Before the 93 minutes of THE LADY IN RED is complete she is forced to spend time working in a sweat shop (where Corman staple Dick Miller makes his good-bad guy appearance), prison, and a brothel where there is a bevy of bust shots.  A tad titty gratuitous, maybe; but, still, it IS a realistic portrayal of a 1930 Chicago brothel.
The Romanian Madame is played by Louise Fletcher (One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest).  Good to see her Not typecast as the wicked nurse in The Lady in Red.

And don't disregard Jonathan Demme's second feature CRAZY MAMA starring Gloris Leachman  and Ann Sothern as a mother daughter, soon to be bank robber team in 1957.  Along with grand daughter (Linda Purl, kinda sexy) and her TWO boyfriends (one played by Donn Most from Happy Days) they must travel back to Arkansas from California to get their lives back.  They pick up a lawman (played by Stuart Whitman) who quickly is in cahoots with the thieves on the run.  Leachman heads the show and is sometimes quite amusing as the zaniness proceeds.  So is Sothern and her slow southern drawl.
There is a pretty good 50s soundtrack too that gives the movie a minor American Grafitti feel to it.
CrAZY MAMA is a 4 star movie at best.
THE LADY IN RED and the Grindhouse double-feature feature elevate the overall rating.
Check this out.  You might be surprised just how good and cinematic this Corman B production is.

7959272,4,B000063K0P,"These disparate genre films have little in common other than that they were early offerings by Jonathan Demme and John Sayles while they toiled for schlockmeister  Roger Corman.  Demme as director and Sayles as screenwriter demonstrate in these films flashes of the brilliance that would inform their mainstream work.  The better of the two works would probably be ""Crazy Mama"" because it is deliciously frantic and Demme evokes the late Fifties expertly through a terrific soundtrack and lush art design.  ""Lady in Red"" isn't bad but I found it a little too fanciful in relating the tale of Polly Franklin, John Dillinger's squeeze when he was gunned down in front of Chicago's Biograph Theatre.  Pamela Sue Martin,
 who was graduating from girl-next-door roles (TV's ""Nancy Drew""), does commendable work as Franklin but not enough to push this flick into the indispensable category.  On a trivial note Cloris Leachman, star of ""Crazy Mama"", played Franklin in John Milius' 1973 ""Dillinger"".",1451520000,,992,5.20125786163522
