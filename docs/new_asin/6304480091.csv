If you hate 1980s style movies you won't likely enjoy this movie.

It's not a laugh a lot comedy, but it has the 80's style comedy (which I like). But, it is a spy movie and also a goofy movie.

The main actor is like Mr. Magoo a bit and that's the style of comedy that it has.

I loved that it takes place in a southern European Island as I had never heard of the island and it was neat seeing a part of the world in it that isn't well known.

It kind of reminded me of the movie Clue and the man who knew too little movie.

This is a rainy day and amuse me movie, but not a make a great impression movie.",1466726400,,681,3.6944444444444446
8191168,1,6304480091,"Entirely forgettable and strangely paced movie with a diabolical smiling young Donald Sutherland.  The only bright moments were seeing the great Robert Morley in one of his final if not final role.  Ruth Gordon, too.  I am dying to know the breed of the dog Prus played by Bruce.  I say it is a Great Dane, but my friend says it's a Dogo Argentino.  If anybody knows please help settle the bet.",1425081600,,394,4.416666666666667
