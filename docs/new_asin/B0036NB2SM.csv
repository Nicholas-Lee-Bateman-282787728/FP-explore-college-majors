8390108,5,B0036NB2SM,I thought I was in pretty good shape when I got this DVD but boy was I wrong. I could not finish the third segment which was a surprise considered I am in pretty good shop.  Within a week my butt is more listed and arms more tighter abs the same. It def not for the faint of heart trust me. I love it though because it challenges me and I have also bought her other DVDs. I highly recommend.,1376956800,,391,3.8875
8390109,5,B0036NB2SM,This workout is intense but doing it 3 times a week with no other changes has helped me break through my plateau. I had bariatric surgery in January and hit a plateau after losing 80 pounds doing elliptical and tae bo work plus I wasn't seeing the leg muscle development I wanted. I replaced tae bo with this. Wow. It took me about 2 weeks to be able to do this workout straight through. And boy was it worth it. Sylwia is an inspiration. This workout is not for beginners or heavier people. I started this workout once I hit 280 and still had to fight through a bit of knee pain so I decreased my intensity. But there is no way on this green earth I would've been able to do this at 360+. Just be careful.,1354492800,,706,4.1231884057971016
8390110,5,B0036NB2SM,"this workout is really good. im in good shape and this was pretty tough for me. i completed the entire thing twice so far and plan on doing it 3 times a week. its A LOT of squats and lunges combined with some upper body work so you get a total body workout. the instructor uses 2 lbs weights but i use 3lbs and 5lbs. its a lot of reps so i wouldnt recommend going any higher than 5lbs. i pause in between the workout to do some more upper body work and cardio. the dvd is 1 hr long, it starts with cardio, then squats and then lunges and then mat work. i would like more ab work but you can add your own routine to it, no biggy. I LOVE THIS DVD!",1338940800,,645,3.8208955223880596
8390111,5,B0036NB2SM,"I am always on the lookout for an advanced cardio/strength workout.  There are days when I feel like working myself almost to exhastion and I usually end up doing one of my DVD's twice, or making up my own workout.  Didn't have to with DVD.  This is an exerciser's exercise DVD.
After doing 30 intense minutes of the Glutes/lunge section my thighs and butt felt like they were on fire.  While working the gluetes and legs with squats, jumps, front/side/back/cursty lunges, and calf raises, you will also intersperse the moves with arm movements light weights.  I may have made it sound easy in these few sentences, but, unless you are an athlete in training, you will feel this!
Beginners, even with modifications, it may not be safe to attempt these moves...I would start with the Biggest Loser seriers and work up to this one.  Intermediate and Advanced, I think you'll love the intensity this DVD offers!",1281225600,2,907,4.782051282051282
8390112,5,B0036NB2SM,"This is a challenging workout that will really get your heart rate up there, but it's also a lot of fun!  There's something addictive about this workout that makes me really look forward to doing it.  After I do this workout each time, I always feel so accomplished since it's tough to get through all of it.

It's broken down into several main sections:  cardio drills, 15 minutes of squats, 19 minutes of lunges, 17 minutes of mat work, and a cooldown.  There is no warm up stretching, so I usually add that in on my own.  To make it harder, you can also repeat the cardio drills between each of the main sections.

There is also a bonus interview with Sylwia that I enjoyed watching before doing this workout the first time.  She is such a sweetheart, and seems to truly care about helping women accomplish their fitness goals.  Also, this workout has a voice over, so it's not actually Sylwia who is speaking.

The focus of this workout is definitely more on the legs, but you do also use light weights for some upper body work.  Since there are a lot of lunges and squats, you might want to find an on-line preview of the workout if you have bad knees.  I have a tendency toward tendonitis in my right knee, but so far this workout hasn't made it flare up as long as I focus on maintaining good form.

Most importantly, you will get great results after doing this workout.  After doing this workout just a few times and changing nothing else with my eating or other workouts, I noticed that my pants are slimmer.  In fact, I'm here on Amazon to order her other two DVD's so I can do an all-Tonique rotation for a few weeks.  I'll report back on my results.

I've also heard that Sylwia is going to be filming a few more workouts this summer (summer of 2010), including one that has more of an upper-body focus.  I can't wait for them to come out!

UPDATE ON 7/5/10:  While I still love this workout, it did end up causing the tendonitis in my right knee to flare up really badly.  I was doing this workout plus her Tonique 2 workouts three times a week, and my knee pain really kicked in.  If you have any kind of knee trouble, just be careful with this workout, and perhaps only do it once a week.",1275004800,8,2203,4.309002433090025
8390113,5,B0036NB2SM,"This is a hard workout, guaranteed to burn calories if you can manage to keep going at it. I highly recommend this workout for anyone who wants a challenge. I consider myself advanced and am very happy with this purchase.",1273190400,3,221,4.55
8390114,5,B0036NB2SM,"This video is for those who are actually serious about working out.  You get your cardio (interval training) and your mat work in one DVD.  It lasts for one hour.  I have done the workout a total of three times so far and I still have not completed the lunge section, something to aspire to I guess.  The music is great and the instructor is  not annoying at all.  I do wish there were more ab work in the video, but other than that this workout would undoubtedly get anyone in shape.  Some people may need to wear knee support due to all the lunges and squats.  This feels like a very effective workout; it's definitely a challenge, believe me.",1267401600,9,645,4.316666666666666
8390115,5,B0036NB2SM,"I just love, love Tonique, I only have  this one, but after doing this one for awhile, I'm now going to buy all of them. it's  tough, tough, did I say tough... and somewhat grueling workout, but absolutely no dread factor for me, it really gives me a adrenaline high and when I finished I feel sooooooooo good, just love this workout. If you're thinking about it go for it, it will definitely challenge and push you to your limits. There are some higher impact cardio moves like Jumping jacks and high knee jogs and lots and lots of lunges and squats, so if you got ""iffy"" knees it may not be a good fit. If this workout doesn't get you in shape nothing will, It is chaptered so you can break it up till you get stronger. There also is a Floor work chapter at the end. This dvd has a voice over which is a bit annoying, I just mute it and play my own music.",1267142400,7,857,4.095238095238095
