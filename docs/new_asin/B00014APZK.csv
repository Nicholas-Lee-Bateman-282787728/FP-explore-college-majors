8006209,4,B00014APZK,"This contemporary (2003) look at the Dutch progressive rock band Ekseption (1969-1975) consists mostly of vintage TV footage showing them miming to their records. There are 24 songs here, and at least 18 of them are productions from Holland TV. In the style of the times, everybody is wearing wild clothing and they're posed in unlikely settings -- beaches, rooftops, pools, a tractor salesroom(?) -- either with unplugged instruments or, if the budget is really slim, none at all.

The other six songs are studio rehearsals or concert footage filmed for some contemporary documentary or maybe TV news. These instances, where the band actually play their instruments, are a lot more interesting. And in one case, revealing (""Dharma for One"" plays behind other footage, and the band is appallingly bad.)

The set begins with a 2003 interview between trumpeter Rein van den Broek -- the only Ekseption member to appear on all their records -- and the widow of Tony Vos, producer of all their early recordings. Rein admits to being a little surprised at how good the band was thirty years earlier.

That's the good news. Now to my reservations about this disc. Everything's in Dutch, although English subtitles are available. The sound is mono. The disc is PAL, so it only plays on my computer. None of the other members of Ekseption, including the driving force Rick van der Linden (who passed away in 2006) are interviewed, although Rein does mention trying to contact them (just not very hard apparently). The version of the band 1976-1977, when Hans Jansen took over keyboard duties from Rick, isn't mentioned at all -- although Rein participated. Nor are any of the reunions mentioned, which took place sporatically between 1978 and 2003. According to the official chronology of this DVD, the band officially ended in 1975.

A lot more information could have been included. Considering this is the ONLY documentary evidence of one of Europe's biggest sensations of the '70s though maybe we should just be happy there's anything at all.",1330041600,,2037,5.0
