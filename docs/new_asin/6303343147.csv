In this movie,Tintin joins an archeologist, Sophocles Sarchopagus on his search for the tomb of the pharaok Ki-Osk. the mystery thickens and tintin then finds himself in Arabia then in India. This story also is significant as it is the first to show the bumbling Thompson and Thomson, the look-alike detectives, and Roberto Rastapopoulos, the movie tycoon. All three characters become significant in the later Tintin adventures.",1041984000,5,605,4.771428571428571
