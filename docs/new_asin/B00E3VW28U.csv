5889418,5,B00E3VW28U,"This is the best DVD series ever! Our children LOVE Brother Francis, for Easter they received the last two DVDs to complete the series (there are 9 as of right now, but I understand there are more in the works!). These are a great and fun way to pass along the Faith to children, and are very enjoyable for adults to watch with the children as well. Great concepts, fun songs, enjoyable animation, and a lot of variety while still adhering to the correct doctrinal Catholic teaching. We love these!",1428451200,3,498,4.544444444444444

5889421,5,B00E3VW28U,"This is a great DVD for children. I like the object lesson with the birthday party to show children that Jesus should be the focus of our celebrations & the depictions of the gospels. I also like that it mentions that Christmas is ""Christ's mass"" because I believe it's important for our children to realize that Christmas is a thoroughly Catholic holiday.",1420416000,,356,4.758064516129032

5889423,5,B00E3VW28U,This series of totally engaging children's DVD's add to any religious education curriculum. They are relevent yet hold the child's attention. I have used several in my Grade 2 class and intend to use them all over the course of the year. This one is especially beautiful as it focuses on the true meaning of Christmas without dismissing the conventions of the secular world. They are a great addition to your video library.,1391817600,3,423,4.808219178082192
5889424,5,B00E3VW28U,"The King is Born begins by talking about all the traditions and activities people associate with Christmas, including decorating a tree, baking cookies, and exchanging presents. He then explains that with all the hustle and bustle of the season, it's easy to forget the true reason for the season, Christ's birthday. He follows this up with the example of how you would feel if you had a birthday party and everyone ignored you and just focused on themselves instead. We have birthday parties to show appreciation and thankfulness for the person's birth. This leads us to how thankful we should be that Jesus came to earth to be born and ultimately die and save us from our sins.

Brother Francis then tells us the Biblical account of the Christmas story. I appreciate the fact that this DVD told the WHOLE story, too! We begin with Gabriel appearing to Zechariah and telling him that his wife Elizabeth will bear him a son and that he should name his son John. Then comes the Annunciation of Gabriel to Mary, Mary's Visitation to Elizabeth, the birth of John the Baptist and the Nativity of Jesus. It wraps up with Jesus' Presentation in the Temple, and Simeon prophesying to Mary about the sorrow she will experience. I wish there would have been mention of Herod, the Magi, and the Holy Innocents, but I am impressed with all the aspects of the Christmas story it did cover. Lastly, after the Christmas story is over, Brother Francis offers a succinct summary of how Christmas is just the beginning of the story of God's love.

This is the perfect Christmas gift for your little ones, but I'd honestly recommend opening it up early and watching it during Advent. Your kids are bound to get distracted by all the lights and presents and talk of Santa, and that's fine. They are just kids. However, it is our job to make sure that they know the real ""reason for the season"" and not let the other distractions envelop the whole season of Advent and Christmas. I very much recommend this DVD for parents of little ones, catechists, and teachers in Catholic or Christian schools.",1386720000,6,2077,4.6876712328767125

8600782,1,B00E3VW28U,"I did not like this DVD, it talked about the birth of Jesus but did not continue the Christmas Story about the Wise Men (Kings) coming to bring gifts to Jesus, it went into him growing up and dying for us and going to heaven, not what I expected about a Christmas story.  I will not show this to the kids in my Religion Class, I will look for a different DVD",1452211200,,358,3.9722222222222223
