8282176,1,B001B82PGC,"Bought this movie twice,from the same supplier,and twice the DVD started malfunctioning at the same place(the main menu) .
Something must be wrong with the way it was manufactured( it's made in Russia). The worst thing,though,is the fact that I had to pay the return shipping fee for something that is obviously bad. So I definitely don't recommend this seller.
The movie itself is very nice,though,the same I watched long ago.",1327708800,,427,5.028169014084507
