174190,4,0977281361,"If you have never studied Qigong before these DVDs are easier to follow.  The animation really helps you ""see"" what you are feeling.  Using both the L1 and L2 dvd's can really help you create and sustain a workout that you look forward to doing everyday.  Anyone can do this, and reap the benefits of it.",1289692800,,304,4.392857142857143
174191,5,0977281361,This is an easily accesible qigong instructional that brings HEART into QIGONG.  From body to qi to Universal Qi and back.  Truly a masterful creation ;),1285545600,,153,4.846153846153846
174192,5,0977281361,"These videos show the Level two form in amazing detail.  If you've been to a Qi Revolution, this brings it back into your house.

And more importantly, the second part of the form where the 9 breath method is taught allows for a deeper understanding of the few but critically important steps that allow you to fully experience the power of this breath work.

I had a huge heart opening experience at the seminar, and yet once I studied the technique more deeply with the dvds, I was really able to see just how transformative the 9 breath truly is.

I've taken classes on rebirthing and this work causes that to pale by comparison.",1285459200,,631,4.508771929824562
174193,5,0977281361,"Fantastic Experience!  I enjoyed following along and doing the QiGong with Jeff Primack's Level-1 Qigong Healing Forms DVD.  I've also attended Jeff's 4-Day Qigong events. They introduced me to a new level of energy awareness.  I took Tai Chi from a few different teachers and I never felt energy doing their forms.  Beginning with the first Qigong Healing form (Empty Force) in Level One...I FELT the energy.  The qi (chi) was always there,  I just needed to learn how to ""tap"" into it.  I could feel the energy increase as I did each of the five Qigong forms on Jeff's first DVD.  The Level-2 Healing Forms build on that awareness, even though, a newbie can start with this DVD, too.  I've been practicing Reiki healing since 1983.  Yes, I could feel energy in my hands, but now...I can feel the qi all around me as I ""cultivate the energy"".  My awareness of the energy channeling through me, as I do healing sessions, is much more powerful.  I highly recommend this DVD and all of Jeff Primack's products and classes.  Jeff has taught over 10,000 people the Supreme Science Qigong healing forms and breathwork.  Another great contribution to the Planet.  -- Ojela Frank, author, Reiki Master and qigong practitioner.",1272758400,,1219,4.793269230769231

7794809,5,0977281361,"THIS DVD CAME WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON THE 9 BREATH METHOD AS WELL AS THE FULL LEVEL TWO FORM.  DOING THE FORM TAKES YOU INTO A MEDITATION LIKE NO OTHER, WOW!! BTW I AM WRITING IN CAPS BECAUSE QIGONG IS FLOWING THROUGH MY FINGER TIPS AS I TYPE :-) REALLY!!!  I LOVE THE PRACTICE OF LEVEL ONE AND TWO HOWEVER LEVEL TWO IS MY FAVORITE!!  THE FIRST TIME I DID THE NINE BREATH METHOD, I FELT ELECTRICITY FLOW FROM MY HANDS AND FINGER TIPS (OMG).  I WAS ALSO ABLE TO HOLD MY BREATH FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD (LONGER THAN 90SEC) THEN EXHALING WITH EASE AND GRACE.  I GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE DISCOVERING YOUR BREATH... HAVE FUN, I DID! aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh :-)",1321660800,,668,4.442622950819672

It builds so well on the Level 1 and takes it deeper into me and into the
Universe!  I healed my broken bone with this one!  Kewl!",1290297600,,205,3.744186046511628
7794813,5,0977281361,"Continuing in the same great format of his Level 1 Qigong Healing Form DVD, this shows the exercise form with special effects animation to demonstrate the qi. This animation makes the video exceptionally intuitive -- great for practicing when you don't have access to a teacher! DVD extras also discuss special points of the exercises and also qigong theory.

This Level 2 form incorporates more meditative exercises than the Level 1 form, taking you deeper into the experience of the qi, deepening your practice and expanding the benefits you receive from it. The Nine Breath Method is mind-blowing!! Highly recommended!",1290297600,,621,5.21
