8545701,4,B005E8UWAQ,"As a shot on video horror fan, this was pretty good.  Considering some of the SOV sludge I've endured, Cemetery Sisters is fairly cohesive in execution and story.  Two sisters marry men to get rich off of inheritances.  That's really it.  There's not much else to this, besides odd flashbacks, and overlong scenes inserted in CS from another movie.

Full disclosure, most SOV movies aren't something you watch to experience a ""Good"" movie.  It's more about watching the home video camera quality add genuine '80's fashion and watching people who aren't equipped to make movies take their cheapjack shot at it.  That's where these movies get entertaining, and CS has enough of these odd moments to win me over.  Maybe a little middle of the pack in the so-bad-it's good category, but I was still entertained and pleasantly surprised.

It's a REALLY good thing this movie is about an hour long.

This scale is confusing, but so is loving the SOV genre.",1447891200,5,1008,4.8023255813953485
