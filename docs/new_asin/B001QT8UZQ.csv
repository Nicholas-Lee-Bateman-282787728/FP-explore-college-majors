8336211,5,B001QT8UZQ,"Documenting the fast pace action of a tournament of this nature is no easy feat.  The camera work and editing of this DVD really puts the audience in the seat of the action.  Not only did I enjoy the tournament footage itself, but also the interviews with the contestants.",1238544000,,272,4.530612244897959
8336212,5,B001QT8UZQ,"This video was fast paced and exciting. It shows real Chinese swordsmanship at its best. The competitors are using real weight wooden swords at high speed. There is no time for thinking, just whatever reactions are already trained in. Watching it was the next best thing to being there. A teenager viewing it with me said I was behaving like her Dad when he watches football. Well ... it was exciting.

The production begins with Scott Rodell explaining to the audience how the judging will proceed. This is followed by every pools match. You soon get to know the participants by their different coloured gear. You see all the action without any of the waiting time while people prepare for their bouts. You get to see it all and make your own judgments of who is winning, confirmed or negated by the slow action replays of controversial strikes.

Then come the direct elimination matches. One by one the now familiar competitors are eliminated. It comes down to the last two and the nail biting match goes on and on with more than one close call. This is followed by presentation of a very nice sword to the winner.

The DVD ends with competitors commenting on their preparation, their matches, and what they have learnt. It makes you want to be in the next tournament.",1236729600,2,1270,4.660714285714286
