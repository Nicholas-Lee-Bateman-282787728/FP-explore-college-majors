298020,1,6300274608,"There was lot of Disney hype surrounding this film when it came out in  1945 and although I vividly remember pestering my mother to see it and buy  the book , I didn't remember the film content at all.  We're now in the  stage of buying films for our grand-children and this seemed like a  natural.  Seeing it now, I can understand why I didn't remember it. Even  Disney can make a dud.  The dancers are wooden and stiff, totally lacking  grace.  The vocalists are terrible.  The expressions on both display  boredom.  Donald's skirt chasing is tedious and overdone.  The  ""beauties"" on the beach are chubby, frumpy and stiff (I may be at  fault for applying 2000 standards to 1945 film). Some features are just  dated and now inappropriate, such as Joe Carioca's stogie and Panchito's  blazing six-guns. However, trying to put it in the perspective of life,  values and humor in a simpler time just doesn't work-it is a bad movie,  then and now.  Although some segments are cute, they are not tied together  and overall it lacks continuity. The only positive features are the vivid  colors  in the animations and the abstractions are well done also.  Its  hard to believe that there is enough demand for this film to keep it in  print.",958953600,3,1236,4.627906976744186
298021,4,6300274608,"As cohesive films go, this isn't at the top of the list. As the Amazon reviewer commented, Donald doesn't do much more in this movie but run around after Latin beauties. But Disney cut the animators loose otherwise,  and the result is eye-poppingly energetic. Mary Blair, Ward Kimball, and  the rest created one of the first visually anarchic animated movies,  breaking every rule. For animation fans, the title song and ""You  Belong To My Heart"" are not to be missed.",958435200,4,468,4.8125

Anyone who loves the 'Pink  Elephants on Parade' sequence from Dumbo, needs to jump on this.",957830400,3,365,5.066666666666666

298422,3,6300274608,"At the risk of losing my Disnerd status, I have a confession to make - until this weekend I had not seen all of the official Disney animated movies.  And that's even though I have owned The Three Caballeros for a decade.  I finally fixed that this weekend.  As I suspected, I wasn't missing much.

The Three Caballeros grew out of a trip that Walt Disney and several of his animators took to South America as part of a goodwill program during World War II.  It was the second animated feature to be influenced by their trip.

You want to know about the plot?  There is none.  Instead, we get a series of animated shorts and some cultural vignettes that are roughly tied together by Donald's (Clarence Nash) birthday.  He's received three presents from his friends down south, and as he opens them, we get to enjoy them, too.

Up first is a film strip, which contains two shorts.  There's ""The Cold-Blooded Penguin,"" a story about a penguin who decides to leave Antarctica for warmer climes.  As someone who gets cold at the drop of a hat I could sympathize with this one.  Next comes ""The Flying Guachito"" about a donkey with wings and the boy who tries to tame it.  Again, it's fun.

As Donald moves on to his next present, along comes Jose Carioca (Jose Oliveira), a Brazilian parrot.  Through the magic of film, he literally takes Donald to see some traditional dances in Brazil.  Then comes the final present and the third caballeros, Mexican rooster Panchito (Joaquin Garay).  Via a flying serape, Panchito takes Donald and Jose to various parts of Mexico to see more traditional dances, the beaches of Acapulco, and even the tradition of Las Posadas in which the children search through the town for a house willing to welcome the weary travelers of Mary and Joseph.  When they find one, they celebrate with a piata.

While Disney counts this as an animated feature, there are plenty of live action scenes once Jose and Panchito arrive on the scene.  We see film of real people doing the dances and the children walking through the village with lights.  Donald and the other birds might interact some, but mostly it's a chance to see the culture at work.

Sadly, when Donald is interacting with the ladies, he is flirting shamelessly.  In Brazil it's actually kind of cute as he is almost too shy to ask anyone to dance.  But by Mexico he's turning into a wolf (okay, not literally, but close to it).  When they hit Acapulco, there's a very uncomfortable scene where Donald is chasing the ladies on the beach (no men to be found anywhere).  They are laughing as they run away, but it's not remotely funny and frankly in poor taste.  I can't even see how it was in good taste in 1944 when the film was released.

Then there's the final bit where someone sings ""You Belong to My Heart"" as Donald again tries to catch her attention.  The animation here was colorful, but it was also just bizarre, even for the studio that brought you some of the segments of Fantasia.

That's not to say it was all bad.  The two shorts in the first present are quite fun.  The dancing and singing is fun to watch.  There are some interesting tidbits about the cultures of Brazil and Mexico.  And some of Donald's antics are entertaining as always.

On the other hand, it can drag and the lack of a coherent plot really makes it more of a travel documentary than an entertainment film.

In many ways, I'm surprised that Disney still references this movie as much as they do.  It's the basis of a boat ride in the Mexico pavilion in EPOCT and these three birds can now be seen in it's a small world.  For that reason alone, I'm glad I watched it.

But would I recommend it?  Yes, but with the understanding of what it is.  This isn't an entertaining movie but a travelogue of sorts.  But I think the biggest audience for The Three Caballeros will be other Disnerds like me.",1432425600,,3857,4.505050505050505

298877,4,6300274608,"Disney Studios saw some hard times in the ""war years"" resulting in some lesser know or well received titles to sustain the studio with these short subjects and war films for the military. The studio's 7th effort The Three Caballeros is a charming group of short subjects worthy of a place in any Disney fan's library. While certainly not on par with any of their previous efforts this is still Disney when Walt was still alive.

It's a shame that the studio seems to disregard these selections from this time period because I think restored versions for the 6 films during this period could be put into one Blu Ray box set  and maybe entice Disney fans to purchase these forgotten little gems. Sure they released a 2 feature version a couple of years ago of this and Saludos Amigos, but it has none of the extras from the original releases and no restoration to warrant a double dip.

If the studio wants these films to sell well, they have to show a little effort!. I own the Gold Edition of this release and it will have to do until a decent upgrade comes along. Hopefully unedited(even if slightly). What is it with smoking cartoon characters?!

I hope Disney is listening and does a decent job restoring this(unedited), Saludos Amigos(unedited), Make Mine Music(unedited) ,Fun and Fancy Free, Melody Time(unedited) and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. Then releases them on Blu Ray in a single box set and adds as much bonus material as they can find. Then maybe they'll see that even the little guys can make them a profit again.

298999,3,6300274608,"The Three Caballeros was originally produced as a good will message to South America and it really does come off like a big smooch. I can remember watching this when I was young (which by the way wasn't even close to its original release date in 1945). It really makes South America look like a beautiful, colorful, music filled parade. You won't see a scrap of poverty or a shred of political strife but it's Disney so what do you expect. Like Main Street at Disneyworld the film isn't intended to mirror reality it's intended to create a safe cheery environment for Children. So does it pass the test of time? Uh, no.

The movie opens with Donald Duck receiving a large package from South America containing among other things a film reel that's used as a plot device to string together a few short segments. The first story is about a penguin who dreams of living in a tropical climate. Most of the segment seems to be an excuse to feature a travelogue of South America's western coastline. The next is an animated primer on the birds of South America some of which I found a bit dubious. This is followed by a rather banal story about a boy who finds a flying winged burro and takes him as a pet. After this the second of the three Caballeros, the anthropomorphized parrot Jos Carioca, springs from a pop up book to sing about the Brazilian city of Baia. Dragging Donald into the book itself, the two find themselves in a musical montage mixing animation and live actors in an effect that feels rather dated.

Finally the third member of the trio, the rooster Panchito Pistoles, shows up to tell about Mexico and take them on a flying serape ride around live footage of what I assume is Mexico City. At one point the three fly around Acapulco beach which is exclusively populated by woman and engage in some strange harassment as they dive bomb the sun worshippers. From here on out the film is pretty much one long dance number with human actors and cartoons less than seamlessly blended. Much of it was bizarre to the point of resembling a bad acid trip. It felt like a poor man's Fantasia with generic Latin music.

The Three Caballeros is effective at giving children a very positive (if surreal) image of South America which was the intention. Before I knew about drug lords and South American dictators and sky high murder rates I saw Aurora Miranda dancing with Donald Duck to Latin music and it always stuck with me. It's not reality but as propaganda goes it's pretty effective. On the other hand it's not very enthralling for a feature film. Compared to just about any other Disney feature animation The Three Caballeros is extremely lightweight and often boring particularly for attention span deficient children today. It may be fun to watch once but for me I see no reason to own it.",1321488000,2,2800,4.573705179282869

299002,5,6300274608,"Disney's ""The Three Caballeros"" is a feature that my family grew up loving and quoting our whole lives.  It is an animated feature that features segments with live action as well.  It starts with Donald Duck receiving a gift from his bird relatives in South America.  One of the gifts is a film projector and by watching the film Donald learns about birds in South America, a penguin, a flying donkey, an Aracuan(I challenge you not to laugh at that scene)and many others. Some are presented in narrated animated stories others are presented like an animated nature film.  Through opening the other gifts Donald meets his other cousins Joe Carioca a Brazilian green parrot who takes Donald to Baia, in Brazil. ""Have you been to Baia""is a great song from this segment and it will stick with you. Donald and Joe travel to Baia and this is the first segment where they interact with live actors.  Seeing Donald go crazy for Latin women is a remaining gag through out and a treat to watch. Once Donald and Joe leave Baia they open the next gift and out pops Panchito a Mexican rooster. Panchito shares the customs and traditions of Mexico with Donald and Joe Carioca. In another live action sequence, watching Donald Duck chase the woman on Acapulco Beach is hilarious!!!!

He gets several small packages that turn out to be travelogues to South America and Mexico. The animation is mixed with live action movie. This movie is more for adults then geared towards children. I can not see myself enjoying this much as a child. However now as an adult I enjoy the music, songs and top rated animation. Recommended. 4/5.",1295827200,,498,4.870588235294117
299046,4,6300274608,"Walt Disney's outreach to the South American market resulted in a couple of films--SALUDOS AMIGOS was the first, and THE THREE CABALLEROS came next. To make a comparison, I'd have to see ""SA"" again, but I do recall that it had some charming musical sequences.

The same is true of THE THREE CABALLEROS, especially when the musical score includes the title song (delightully done by Panchito, Jose Carioca and Donald Duck), and repeated throughout, and ballads such as YOU BELONG TO MY HEART and HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO BAIA? All of them are performed with some fantastic art work and animation combining live action and cartoon characters.

The last fifteen minutes seems to be scrambling for a way to keep the viewer's attention with some explosive fireworks and a dazzling display of surrealism, minus any conception of a way to end the movie on a high note. The film itself is uneven, offering typical Disney animation for the flying donkey sequence and then resorting to over-the-top fireworks that outdo the Pink Elephants number from DUMBO.

But it's hard to resist the bouncy South American flavor of the score and the charming characterizations of Donald, Panchito and Jose Carioca. The stylized conception of a Mexican Christmas by artist Mary Blair is a standout among the art work involved here, although later the pi&ntilde;ata sequence is a bit overwhelming in effects.

The dazzling color and the music make it worth watching at least once, although it's hard to make a comparison between this and other Disney full-length features. Some of the action is fast and furious but its colorful nonsense is the sort of thing that will appeal to very young children.

Summing up: You will either love it or hate it, but if you're a Disney fan you should see it at least once.",1295136000,,1780,4.842105263157895

299050,5,6300274608,"Don't worry about the cigar. Don't worry about the guns. Don't worry about the ethnic stereotypes that are found in this 1940's Disney film. What matters about this film is that it's fun, energetic, beautiful, and completely colorful. Donald Duck, Jose Carioca, and Panchito Pistoles bring a whole lot of entertainment for seventy minutes. The songs aren't as memorable as the more classic songs like ""Friend Like Me"" or ""Hakuna Matata,"" but they're very lively and very fun to listen to (the slower ones very ethereal to revel in). Animation is gorgeous, while at times wild (especially near the end of the film). And never mind about the ethnic stereotypes: this animated film was made 65 years ago. And besides, none of the stereotypes are negative. All in all, this is a superb, but underrated, Disney film. One of the all-time greats, in my opinion.

299051,5,6300274608,"The Three Caballeros is one hour and twelve minutes long and was released in theaters on February 3, 1945. This was the second of the Disney's package film series with Saludos Amigos. The Three Caballeros is seventh animated feature film from Disney Studios. This is the only movie where Donald Duck is the star of the film and the only full length film where he does not share the screen with Mickey Mouse or Goofy. Basically it is Donald's birthday and he got a package of gifts from his friend Jos Carioca. The first gift is a film projector with a screen and a movie to it. Watch the first two of several segments in the film. The segments are the Cold-Blooded Penguin and The Flying Gauchito. The next gift is a book titled Brazil and Jos Carioca appears and the two take a trip inside the book to Bahia; misspelled Baia in the film. Baia is the name of the next segment and we meet Aurora Miranda; sister of Carmen Miranda. Aurora sings and dances in her segment. Finally Donald opens his last present and we are introduced to Panchito Pistoles; a rooster from Mexico. Panchito takes us through Mexico and giving the viewers a little history about the country as well seeing some of the sites of Mexico. This would be Panchito only film appearance, but he would go on make a few appearances in the Disney television series House of Mouse. Here we have the last of the four segments of the movie: Las Posadas, Mexico: Ptzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco, You Belong To My Heart, and Donald's Surreal Reverie.

The Three Caballeros and Saludos Amigos were put out to strengthen ties with the Latin American countries during World War II. The Three Caballeros was the first full length movie to combine live action and animation. The Three Caballeros is not a bad movie and in my opinion is the best of the six package films put out by Disney. The Three Caballeros gets an AA++.

The songs, Music,a nd the acting are awesome. Disney was ahead of his time. The colros really caputre my atteation. My younger cousins who are 3,6, and 10 really loved the movie and i have learn from this movie.

299053,5,6300274608,"I love this movie.

Donald Duck gets a gift from his South-American cousins in the form of a giant box of movie reels and eventually goes down to take a tour of the beautiful culture of South America. Children are exposed to different customs and dialects through dance and song, and there are great cartoon stories (the story of the Donkey Bird being my absolute favorite) and hear Sterling Holloway (Winnie The Pooh) tell the story of Pepito the Penguin, who searches for a warmer home because he is tired of being cold!

My young son has always been picky, and besides Yo! Gabba Gabba, this has been his favorite movie. There is a ton of music and dancing, funny and interesting cartoon characters and beautiful bright colors.

If you remember it from when you were a kid and want to give it a try for your kids, do it. You will find yourself singing along and having a great time.",1260835200,,884,4.478260869565218

299086,4,6300274608,"This was one of my favorite movies as a small child. I was probably about two or three years old when I saw it for the first time. Every bit of it held my attention, although I favored certain scenes over others--the ones with bouncy music in particular. The slow and languid ""You Belong to My Heart"" marked my least favorite part of The Three Caballeros, but Donald acting silly and swooning over the woman singing the song always helped make up for it.

Some reviewers claim that the film is too confusing for children. While Three Caballeros is a surreal travelogue that jumps in different directions, I never found it confusing or boring as a wee tot. On the other hand, the ""sexual references"" some reviewers mention never entered my head. All I saw was that Donald loved being with pretty girls.

Someone with fragile sensibilities might be offended by the following: 1) Jose Carioca's cigar; 2) Donald chasing pretty girls; 3) Panchito Pistole's pistols; 4) colorful psychedelic images, oh my.

Others get impatient with The Three Caballeros because it doesn't follow a smooth, coherent storyline the way other Disney movies like Snow White and Cinderella do. It was a very experimental movie: Mostly it's a travelogue to give Americans a little taste of Mexico and South America, with Donald Duck representing the American tourist. There are musical numbers, short cartoons with independent storylines, and surreal Fantasia-like segments.

The Three Caballeros is a Disney movie that I enjoy to this day, and if I had children, I wouldn't hesitate to share this with them.",1228694400,,1580,4.950943396226415

299088,5,6300274608,"I loved this film and rented it many many times as a child. Nothing about this film offended my parents and especially didn't offend me.
Donald Duck's supposed sexual romps involve nothing more than chasing women around on the beach which lead into many sight gags as the girls throw him up into the air etc. etc.
I do not see a problem with this kind of light humor, it is already being seen by your children on their local cartoon networks and nickelodeons. (Not to mention that your children won't give it a second thought)

I also do not understand why this film ""isn't for children"". It is almost euphorically happy and fast paced with many gags that both children and their parents can laugh at.(not to mention incredibly colorful and eye catching)

I do not understand also the idea of ""drugs"" being an influence on this kind of thing. Research shows that creativity is heightened more when you are sober...I have a feeling that the ""trippy"" animation done in this film was an outlet of creativity for the animators and trying to test their boundaries to see what they could get away with...and also to provide something unexpted for the audience.

All in all this is incredibly entertaining (with wonderful music), mostly tasteful and very appropriate for anyone of any age...and shouldn't offend you anymore (or in fact less) than your child's current favorite program/film.

P.S. I showed this to my younger brother (who is about 14 years younger than me and is in elementary school) and he absolutely loved it and begged me to buy him a copy. Take it from me and get a copy for your kids.",1187395200,2,1599,4.659574468085107
299089,3,6300274608,"I am a HUGE fan of this movie, but this DVD (as well as the Saludos Amigos, Melody Time, and Make Mine Music DVDs) seriously panders to the soccer-mom crowd.  Smoking (from Goofy in Saludos, and an innocent bystander in Caballeros) is ""digitally altered"" (i.e. censored), while Jose Carioca (who is in both movies) still HAS his cigar!

If Disney had wanted to censor smoking, they should have ""digitally altered"" Jose Carioca's cigar!  I wouldn't be complaining about it if they'd been equal-opportunity butchers (and even then I'd be complaining).

Please Disney, since you're putting the Three Caballeros into the place once occupied by El Rio Del Tiempo, PLEASE re-release this on DVD and PLEASE kill the butchering!!

299090,2,6300274608,"This was one of my favorites as a kid.  I was really disappointed with this DVD. You can see the film grains, especially in the live action/animated scenes.  Also, I don't remember the film entirely, but it seems like they left ALOT of stuff out that was in the original movie.

299091,4,6300274608,"Although Disney originally released this feature (and ""Saludos Amigos"") in the 1940s to improve relations with Latin American countries, I think it's a bit more effective as an introduction to Latin music, art and dance. Carmen Molina does a beautiful rendition of ""You Belong to My Heart"" (although ""Solamente Una Vez"" sounds much better), as does the singer of ""Bahia"". The genius of ""Caballeros"" is the animation, although the integration of animation and film looks shoddy to our ""Finding Nemo""-accustomed eyes, it was pretty cutting edge at the time of its release. Also, it's almost as though the color palettes in the animation were used to reflect Latin American art and textiles: vibrant golds, orange-reds and verdant greens. I don't think you need to be in an altered state to enjoy the hap-hazard animation - just enjoy the detail and coloring. This would be a 5-star review if Disney animators had done better research - there's several spelling errors on the maps shown in the film (i.e. ""Valpraiso"" instead of Valparaiso). I guess Disney didn't figure that any Latinos would actually pay money to see this film back then. I heard people complain about Donald Duck's blatant womanizing in this film, but I saw this as a kid and never really picked up on that.{Who can blame him around us Latin women ;>)} Apart from that, this is an enjoyable film for kids & adults and a nice way to get a taste of classic Latin ballads, dancing and a little art too.",1148688000,5,1465,4.794466403162056

Although the styles of dress are dated, the songs are fun to sing along to, especailly Panchito with his Mexican spirit, engery, and style.  The three caballeros dancing and singing their way through this movie reflect a comradary among the two American continents that exists today.

299136,1,6300274608,"Donald Duck cruising through Latin American swooning over pretty ladies with lots of dancing and birds.  This is a confusing video and really not appropriate for children.

This is a full-feature Disney movie in Technicolor running for what seemed an eternity of 71 minutes. While it is rated G for general audiences I fail to see what a child would get out of The Three Caballeros.

The one nice feature in their favor is the absence of previews on the video. The star of this feature is Donald Duck. He receives a package with a note written in Spanish, which translates to Happy Birthday from your friends in Latin America.

One box has a projector in it that then has one person talking to Donald while another voice is the Narrator of a story about a penguin. This voice is the same that does Winnie the Pooh (Sterling Holloway) here called Professor Holloway!

Pablo the Penguin wants to live on a tropical island and tries many ways to leave and makes a boat that takes him to his Island.

Then there are short clips on this projector with a bird that carries bagpipes under its beard, scissors birds known as the Columbian cutter. A strange story about a flying donkey bird that acted like he was loco! Off to Fiesta Y Carrera to gamble pesos away with ladies and men dancing in the plaza.

Here the Narrator is actually the small person riding the flying donkey and they enter a race against other donkeys. This strange story than comes to an end with the book closing and another birthday box for Donald to open. Out of the box comes a Jimmy Cricket type bird that shrinks himself and Donald so they can go back into the book via train to visit Brazil.

Ladies hips are swaying and the men are donning their sombreros dancing all over the streets of these countries. Jose is busy trying to keep Donald out of the way of the activities taking place.

You might be thinking at this point and what is the purpose of this? I could not answer that as this is the theme of the whole movie! If you are one of the few unfortunate ones to actually have this video, it might be best to don a hat and do the cha cha with your kids and hope the music stops soon!

Soon the book closes and Jose and Donald are back to the place they were before, who knows actually but presume it would be Donald's house. The problem is that they are still small and need to get back to their original sizes. These scenes are silly and point less as the magic shows them in and out of clothing with lots of changes that again make no sense.

The color in the live action scenes in the background is of poor quality with the acting fake looking. The Three Caballeros does a poor job in combining Latin America themes with the Disney name. There has never been anything quite like this and Disney must of learned from this mishap.",1099612800,5,2808,4.370441458733206

Donald receives gifts from his best friends in Latin America. Thrilled,Donald experiences South American life first hand,taking trips from Brazil to Mexico with his pals Jose Carioca and Panchito.
It's one surreal,psychadelic and funny movie. I really liked it a lot,the live scenes were pretty good,and the music was swinging. Being 21,it's unbelieveable for me to like music this old,but I loved it and I'm sure you will,too.

What starts as an above average anthology suddenly turns into an almost psychedelic experience with the blending of live-action and other effects in the last third of the film.  As soon as Jose Carioca shows up, the outrageous fun begins with the song ""Baia"" and a pop up book that opens onto a live-action street.  Soon after, Donald begins acting like a mad stalker, chasing after every woman he sees. Before you know it colors, confetti and characters are sprouting from all over the place during the song ""You Belong To My Heart"".  If it sounds like pandemonium, that because it is, but it's delightful.
Sadly the picture quality is not up to par with other Disney releases.  This is a film that is in real need for digital restoration, but don't let that small irritation keep you from experiencing Disney's most outrageous film ever.",1077235200,6,1043,4.745856353591161
299161,3,6300274608,"The Three Caballeros can never be taken at face value today. I remember the ""Three Caballeros"" song from a Sing-Along video when I was a child, and though I loved that song then, the entire movie could not hold the attention span of young children. But it's still a decent, if experimental, movie with various interpretations.
On one level, it's an artifact from the WWII Pan-American ""Good Neighbor"" period: Brazil and Mexico are presented as exotic and sensual paradises, the women are sex objects, and the cultures are obviously stereotyped. But that level of interpretation is certainly not an entertaining one. It is also, however, a kind of surreal music video in which samba and bossa-nova music are matched up with fluid animation. For those who remember the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence from Dumbo, picture an entire movie based on that clip. Donald Duck and his friends find themselves completely warped by the music: they multiply themselves, grow, shrink, turn into flowers, and much more. It's also a very sexual film, if one chooses to interpret it that way. Connotations and double meanings abound, and if you watch the movie, you will see what I mean.
As far as DVD quality goes, Disney could have restored it better (you can actually see the dust on the screen) which would have made the energetic animation even better. But overall, it's not bad. It's not exactly fun for the kids, but adults may find it interesting in a fun, tacky, misplaced-within-its-own-time kind of way.",1076457600,,1501,4.936758893280633

It's probably my favorite from Walt's studios and it's definitely my youngest daughter's favorite.  I'll also admit that it lacks a coherency of tone in that it starts off much like other cobbled-together movies from that time period (connecting shorter projects together to make something ""move-length"").  But about a third of the way through, true Disney magic starts to happen, and you get tossed through a 40's Latin American vortex that almost has to be the product of some insanely creative young animators/musicians/actors/set designers, etc. given free reign of a studio, along with perhaps some copious quantities of agave plant serum.  When an artform is being maxed-out by people at the prime of their powers, one thing you always feel is that you're being bowled over by hundreds and thousands of IDEAS, too many to absorb in 1 or 100 sittings.  One gets the same feeling from, say, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  If the idea of being taken on a crazy trip that could delight a 75-year-old and a 5-year-old equally appeals to you, then give this one a look.  As far as I'm aware, getting high this way is legal.  [There is a segment in Melody Time called The Rhythm of the Samba that feels like it could've been lifted straight out of this movie - and it's another wild-paced masterpiece.]",1074643200,7,1427,4.744939271255061
299164,3,6300274608,"Donald Duck celebrates his birthday Latino style.
This rather amusing look at Central America, the second of two features commissioned by the Office of Inter-American Affairs, is both far funnier and far stranger than ""Saludos Amigos"".
The hook of Donald accepting a gift from South America which continues to reveal more and more gifts reminds me of a Pinata.  The almost psychedelic trip the gifts send him on are great uses of animation artistry.
Of the cartoons, it's a wonder that ""The Cold Blooded Penguin"" even made it into this movie.  Other than showing the penguin travelling past South America on his journey to warmer climates, it doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie.
But ""The Flying Guachito"" more than makes up for this.  The story of a little boy who finds a flying burro, it fits very well into the framework created for this movie.
Then it progresses into a wild and crazy look at the South American scene.  The music is infectious, and watching Donald chase after every good looking girl that passes his way is rather amusing, but slightly out of Donald's character.
The disconcerting switch from a collection of Disney classic cartoons (most of which were still fairly new at the time) to the live-action travelogue is a bit much to take, but still makes for a fun roller coaster ride that kids might enjoy.
Finally, there's two good Disney cartoon gems, ""Don's Fountain of Youth"" and ""Pueblo Pluto"".  Both cartoons really round out this look at Latin America, and add to the flavor and tone of the movie.
Far more fun than ""Saludos Amigos"", but because it is another travelogue, and contains a mixture of live-action and animation, it may only appeal to Disney purists.",1071187200,,1704,4.782312925170068

Released during the 40s, it's part of several Disney releases that seems to be a collection of stories and vignettes rather than the tradional Disney style. You would NEVER see this type of Disney movie being released today. It claims also to be the first theatrical release to incorporate animation and live movie sequences. It starts off with Donald Duck getting presents in the mail form his friends from South America. One of the presents is a film projector with two cartoons about a penguin longing for warmer weather and then a harsh transition to ""little Gauchito"" and his flying donkey. Both stories have a Central/South America feel and locales, but very little payoff. There's no real punch at the end of both these stories. Then it starts to get strange. It becomes some sort of a South of the Border travelogue. The animation is good, but the mix of animation and filmed musical performances is a little odd a times. It also has an extremely dated feel to the whole production. Still, it's not to be overlooked. This movie might not be everybody's cup-o-joe, but my 3-year-old daughter seems to enjoy it, so I guess ol' Disney knew what he was doing. The bonus cartoons are a real treat as well.

The American media does so much to discredit South America as a drug and crime haven, that it creates generalizations and racism. This film however, points out all the good things that are South of the border and will enrich your childrens understanding while entertaining.
Like I said, the music is dated, but the comedy and cartoon/live interaction is far ahead of its time. The animation is classic and impressive and still outperforms many of todays cartoons. This is worth the buy on DVD because kids will love it and its enjoyable and thought provoking for adults.

299169,4,6300274608,"Three Caballeros was made in 1945, and it is very much a product of its time.  For one thing, at this time Disney was packaging  collections of shorts as movies (i.e., Fun and Fancy Free, Melody Time).  While this approach provided a good escape for moviegoers and was inexpensive to produce (at a time when Disney's future was still shaky), modern viewers who have come to expect a coherent story are often left disappointed.  For another thing, modern notions of political correctness are nowhere to be seen in ""Three Caballeros"".  Donald Duck shamelessly chases women, Joe smokes a cigar and Panchito whoops and fires his pistols in the air like a stereotypical bandito.  This was because in 1945 the Pancho Villa image was still very much in the minds of the people of the U.S.
Despite all of that, I enjoyed this movie!  The contained shorts are amusing and (somewhat) related to the rest of the movie.  Also, although not politically correct, only the most ultra-sensitive viewer would object to how Mexico is protrayed in the movie.  Despite his amusing lecherousness, Donald enthusiastically takes part in a Mexican folk dance.  Although something of a stereotype, Panchito solemnly tells the story of the origins of the Mexican flag and sings a song about Mexico that is not only beautiful it is positively reverent.  In general the music is very good, ranging from romantic melodies like, ""You Belong to My Heart,"" to tributes like, ""Baia"" and of course, ""We're Three Caballeros"" a musical celebration of friendship.

However, _Three Caballeros_ is probably the strangest film to mix live-action with animation, and as such it has gathered something of a cult following.
The obviously sexual escapades of Donald Duck make this film inappropriate for children -- not that they're likely to pay much attention anyway.

A long the way various clips from the foreign countries are show in a documentary style & animated shorts telling stories are intertwined.  The best one is ""The Cold Blooded Penguin"", where a small penguin wants to live life in the sun. This film also landmarked, the first time live action was mixed in with animation in the same scene. The funniest of these segments is when Donald starts chasing the girls on Acapulco beach BUT the best use of this new technology was in the ""Donald Loses His Heart To The Cookie Lady"" scene, where the boys dance around and with live action dancers.
The film is well paced, has great segments, but the music depends on your tastes. But overall, this movie definatley surpasses ""Saludos Amigos"", in all ways possible.
This DVD also contains two funny shorts, ""Pueblo Pluto"" and ""Don's Fountain OF Youth"". The latter is when Donald fools his nephews into thinking he turned into an egg after falling into the fountain.",1005264000,,1223,4.8798076923076925

Apparently this was one of her favorite movies when it was first released.  I have found it to be charming and educational, offering insight into Mexican and South American culture.  My 9 year old found it interesting the first 2 times, but the 3 year old is addicted, watching it every day and singing all the songs.  His little 3 and 4 year old buddies enjoy it too.  It is definitely not the same old, and it beats the Teletubbies any day!",991440000,2,548,4.3861386138613865

299196,3,6300274608,"I've always had a fondness for Disney musicals, particularly the old ones, so this DVD seemed like a perfect choice.  Overall, I thought this was a pretty spiffy film, though it seemed patched together in spots.
The  video portion was very clean, though this digital transfer really lets you  see flaws in the original print. Watch the segments where Donald is  ""behind"" the Cookie Lady in ""Baia,"" and you'll see the  woman is dancing in front of a projected image.  Most of the time the  animated characters are ""layered"" on top of the live-action  reels.  I'll grant that given the age of the film, the visuals are fairly  impressive, but with the animation technology available, one would think  Disney would ""clean up"" some of the imperfections.
That goes  double for sound, which in this release is dead Mono.  Even simulated  stereo would do a better job of reproducing the dynamics of the great music  of this film.  Speaking of which, the music selections (and accompanying  dances) are the highlight of the movie.  I was particularly impressed by  the wonderful ""You Belong To My Heart,"" which segues into a  mildly hypnotic, almost hallucinogenic segment with ""animorphic""  images and brilliant colors.
Though there is a plot to all this (Donald's  birthday tour), the story is little more than a South American travelogue  as envisioned by Disney.  That means a lot of American extras playing  Brazilians and Mexicans, though not all.  I think most kids (and some  adults) will appreciate the camaraderie of the three Caballeros, but  Donald's randy behavior is a little off-putting.  Disney left little doubt  that at least one of the 'three gay cabelleros' was perfectly  'straight.'
This film is, of course, a must-own for any collector of  Disney animation, but for others the choice is less certain.  The music and  elaborate dance routines are worth a peek at the very least.

299197,4,6300274608,"True, THE THREE CABALLEROS isn't a coherent movie; rather it's a collection like FUN AND FANCY FREE and MAKE MINE MUSIC.  But it's better than those two because it has a higher percentage of ""hits"" than  they do.  Let's start with one no one ever mentions -- Baia.  It's just a  song, but one of the most beautiful Brazilian songs, and the peaceful  cartoon simply supplements the song without interfering with it.  A lovely  piece of restrained movie making.  Then there are Donald Duck and Joe  Carioca--their frenzied sequences constitute cartooning at its most clever  and funny heights. Visual humor is humor to be prized, and this film has  more of it than any Disney film I know.  True, some of the ""Sports  Goofy"" cartoons are just as visually funny, but they're an uneven lot,  whereas CABALLEROS shows the Disney studio at the height of its  funny-cartooning powers.  Too bad Uncle Walt isn't around these days.  The  moguls who have taken over his movies reissue these classics on DVDs that  force you to watch a bunch of ads for other movies before you can see the  feature.  As previous reviewers have commented, there's no way you can  fast-forward to get rid of these annoyances.  The net result, of course, is  going to backfire right in Michael Eisner's face.  People are going to  resist buying Disney movies on DVD because of this unnecessary intrusive  pre-loading of ads and other nonsense before you can see the feature.  And  that serves the accountants right -- because they're not creative artists,  they're accountants.  The only torture appropriate to them would be to lock  them up in a room for a week and show them nothing but ads for Disney films  until they go starkers.",964310400,18,1702,4.755172413793104
299198,4,6300274608,"Unlike most of the Disney catalogue, which tends to go in and out of print fairly quickly, this has been availible on video consistently for years.  The old video, which is probably still kicking around (look for the diamond  Disney Classics logo) preserved the original theatrical cut.  This new  video version deletes about ten or twenty minutes of entirely pointless  travelogue type footage that didn't add anything to the film anyways (left  in all the good stuff, like the girls in bathing suits and some interesting  footage of capaiero (sp.?) a Brazilian fighting dance which is now  illegal).  This new cut flows better and will probably be more accessible  to modern audiences.  This is a good pick for fans of psychedelia--rumors  of Disney artists taking peyote or yaje while in South America have been  circulating for years.",960249600,3,838,5.029197080291971
299199,3,6300274608,"For many Disney may mean quality family entertainment, but after purchasing The Three Caballeros on ""Disney DVD"" it also means watching a string of ads. Skipping the ads is a painful process that I  shouldn't have to go through. Each ad must be skipped over, there is no way  to just put in the disk and start watching the film. Each time the disk is  played the ads will play as well. After paying for the disk why should I  have to watch ads, I just want to watch the movie. The advertising doesn't  seem to lower the price of the product. In my opinion this tarnishes an  otherwise good film and I hope Disney tries to be a little more consumer  friendly with its future releases.",959385600,11,683,4.330708661417323

But once Donald starts visiting cities, it gets kinda insensitive involving real women. It's played for laughs for Donald to be ""acting like a wolf"" around all the girls and gets to the point of it being uncomfortable. Especially with all of the displaying of their bodies they put into the movie.
