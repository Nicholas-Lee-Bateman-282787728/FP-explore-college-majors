Fast forward to 20 years later, with the success of OAV (Original Animation Video) in Japan, which allows for edgier material not allowed on broadcast TV, Go Nagai and team decides to relaunch Cutey Honey with an edgier, more adult tone closer to the comics. The results was New Cutey Honey, a sort of sequel and reboot of the original TV series in the home video format. This time with darker stories, more violence and more nudity as nature intended.

Originally planned for 4 episodes, the response was a huge hit in Japan. Toei decided to expand it to a 12 episode run and things started to head south. In the end only 8 out of the 12 were made. The first 4 episodes is a complete story. With Honey fighting Dolmeck, the guardian of darkness. Episode 4, the finale of that story has a clever twist that shows how much the writers understand Honey's abilities. The next 4 deals with the aftermath of this fight with a villain of the week approach and Honey is gradually showing signs that she is out of her league. The script for episode 9 was finished but not produced. It was a Christmas story which explored the theme of dreams and Honey's origin. They made it as a radio drama for the DVD release in 2004 and included it in the BD release as well. For what I gathered from the internet, episode 10 would have been the last standalone story featuring Honey vacationing at a beach resort by herself, only to find the guests at the place start to disappear. The B story features the Hayami family decides to secretly crash Honey's vacation with hilarious results. The last 2 episodes was to be a two-parter featuring the final fight with Panther Zora. Devil Man and the Professor in ep 7 & 8 would return to assist Honey in her final fight and Honey would have received a suit upgrade as well, ditching the blue/red outfit for something like a hyper mode. The bittersweet end would have featured Honey sacrificing herself for Cosplay City, but they discovered another android copy of Honey has been activated and Grandpa Danbei has to renew his quest to find the new Honey yet again...Alas, they never finished the story...

The picture quality for the BD is absolutely stunning! The audio is good as well. The colors are sharp and vivid. The image and animation is crisp and clean. For something that came out more than 20 years ago, I have to say Toei did a beautiful job in restoring it to its true HD glory. It's a real pity that no American distributor has yet to pick this up for a subtitled or dubbed BD distribution. That would have been super nice.",1477094400,2,2670,4.491769547325103
