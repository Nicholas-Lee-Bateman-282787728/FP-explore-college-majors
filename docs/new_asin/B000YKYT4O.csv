8233301,4,B000YKYT4O,"This video is very good but if you do not know the basic steps to the dances you will be lost because it only shows the mans part and not all that well.  If you know how to dance you can pick up the ladies part which is not always a natural opposite.  But well worth the money for us, but if you are a beginner, go for something like Shawn Trautman, etc, to learn the steps.",1325376000,,374,3.844155844155844
8233302,4,B000YKYT4O,Good instruction.  We needed other instruction in addition to this for some of the dances.  There are some great teasers included also.,1271203200,,135,5.090909090909091
8233303,4,B000YKYT4O,"I don't recommend it too beginners! I think it's a little too much for beginning dancers.  Too few examples of the moves, but that's what they have replay for. However, I'm very happy with it.  Well worth the discounted price. I've purchased or reviewed close to 100 dance DVDs.  Initially, over a year ago, when I started dancing and buying dance DVDs; I was extremely unhappy with Teresa Masons DVDs. They were too difficult for me to follow.  Now, after learning the very basics of dance, I've pretty much purchased all of hers for under $12.00 each.  Reason: I think ""Most bang for the Buck"" if you buy them as cheaply as possible.  This DVD has a very varied quantity of moves. Excellent menu and sub-menu operations! Very quickly, you can go right to any spot on the DVD. Need to though because of minimum demonstration of the dance move.",1237161600,2,844,4.593333333333334
8233304,3,B000YKYT4O,Certainly NOT for beginners! More for intermediates who happen to learn fast. The good points are that if you are a quick study then you don't have to worry about repetition. You can get right to the meat of the steps. The music is cute and modern.  A bad point is that they only really demonstrate the lead's part.  The young man puts on so many flurishes to his dance that it would be very confusing to many people as to what is the step to be learned and what is just fancy extra stuff.  The young lady is a very good dancer and fun to watch.  I would suggest this video only if you want to practice between live classes but not if you want to try and learn it alone.,1220140800,,670,4.053030303030303
