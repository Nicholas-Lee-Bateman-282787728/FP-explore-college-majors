7283049,3,B00ZIT10NY,"Brett Reynolds (Tom Pelphrey) is fired, dumped, and broke in one day. He gets a new phone number and through a series of circumstances gets the old recent number of basketball star Tyson St. James played rather unconvincingly by Method Man. Brett plus his two friends accept the perks that go along with having that number. Both Brett and St James, who is a married player, desire Nikki Page (Natalie Hall) the owner's daughter.

The film is a combination of a teen sex comedy and bad romance. The story line was different, but the film humor lacked freshness, except for maybe Priscilla Lopez the off beat mom. Worth a rental for lovers of the genre.

8720346,5,B00ZIT10NY,"This raunchy comedy had my girlfriend and I hysterical from beginning to end. I never heard of the film before browsing Prime Videos and being pulled in by the casting as well as the enticing premise. I enjoyed watching that premise develop into an entertaining, cleverly scripted film. The main character finds himself in completely unique circumstances where the stakes are high but his addiction to a new lifestyle distracts his rational decision making. This journey is something that I believe all people will find intriguing and the film overall has me thinking perhaps indies like this one don't always get the attention they deserve.",1484179200,,641,5.114285714285714
