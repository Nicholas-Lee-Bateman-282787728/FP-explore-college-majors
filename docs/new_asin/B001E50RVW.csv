8296361,5,B001E50RVW,"This is incredibly interesting, right down to the lighthearted laughter at a joke about Buckley being murdered. This is salient and unnerving given that Lowenstein is later murdered by a lone crazed gunman. Oh, and I'm agnostic on the point, but if you want a conspiracy theory built inside of s conspiracy theory,  check that whole affair out in light of this conversation and his growing status as someone who would pursue this to it's end or his own.",1455062400,,453,4.734177215189874

  This one a look at an assasanation theory I forgot about, and don't believe.  Interesting to see such a smart guy go off the rails with this.",1346803200,,285,3.7796610169491527
8296365,5,B001E50RVW,"Seven years after the death of ""our last patriarch,""(RFK) the conspiracy trail winds down, but not out. Here, at a southern university, Mr. Buckley confronts the former skeptic, Allard K. Lowenstein, a young, former cynic with regards to conspiracy theories, who rises to the occasion to reveal in one hour the contradictory facts never fully revealed weighed against the government's ""stated"" and publicized facts openly. After viewing this hour raptly, I was dumfounded that I heard for the first time an alleged tie to the Bush family, repeatedly throughout. (I guess the Bush elder was on the investigating committee)No matter. At that time, the country had suffered the Watergate mess, a farcical House re-investigation of the JFK assassination that called no eye-witnesses with contradictory testimonies,and the ascendancy of a lone independent journalistic team (Woodward/Bernstein), who vanished on the D.C cocktail trail. The only journalist to look beneath the surface of domestic things since, Dan Rather, was disgraced and sent packing. Only an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" in the 90's took up the contradictory eye-witness accounts in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen captured by an eye-witness teen photographer.(What happened to him with his film suggests there is truth to the ""ice-berg"" Buckley brought up several times) Mr. Lowenstein's immediate grasp of facts and names certified that his revelations would all come out, without witty digressions this time to a disturbing puzzlement. Once more, like the 911 Commission Report, the eye-witness testimony does not match the courtroom press or White House ""facts."" And, as Mr. Lowenstein shows, if the agencies will not re-test the guns to certify ballistic consistency, and an investigation eye-witness (Mr. X) does not wish to re-state his physical position to RFK in the kitchen, etc. there will be no exploration of the ""ice-berg"" created by the discrepancy between official accounts and science. The telling remark is when Mr. Lowenstein admits how an untruthful exposure of the facts and contradictions may let untold enemies to influence political campaigns. I don't know if he was thinking of 2001, but it sure seems like it. (Both the investigations(RFK and 911)discard overwhelming eye-witness testimony and good science) Miss Marple or Rumpole would have taken the case on if the ""findings"" said 13 rounds came from a six-shooter. Not our elected officials.",1248652800,15,2435,5.444444444444445
