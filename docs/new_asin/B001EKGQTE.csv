8298515,1,B001EKGQTE,"So much bad to talk about. I'll keep it brief. The soundtrack is awful. The story, I ask you...why? The acting....my local high school drama club could do better. Not even a good bad movie. Oh and the first 4 minutes 2 guys are beating the snot out of each other and guess what? Not a bit of blood or bruising...men of steel? finally one gets a bloody nose and that's it...fight over. Stay away from this mess.",1396310400,,410,4.269230769230769
