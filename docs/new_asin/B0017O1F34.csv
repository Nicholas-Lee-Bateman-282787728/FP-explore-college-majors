My son must have seen this DVD atleast 30-40 times in the last month and still going strong. Waiting for the next series of Ben 10 & Alien Forces...

3174629,4,B0017O1F34,season 4 was what i was respecting but as for the ben 10 movie i was disappointed it was just the same as the tv broad cast you could tell where the commercials where there wasn't any Dolby d enhancement all in all a turn off so i cant give it 5 stars.,1220054400,,252,3.7735849056603774
3174630,5,B0017O1F34,"My 6 and 7 year old boys really love this show and I like it alot too.
The boy (Ben who turns into 10 different aliens) conquers his fears, takes on bad guys and is aided by his cool grandpa.  Very much like American Dragon Jake Long....except Ben is 10 ish instead of a teen.

I even bought the Omnitrix watch for them (here on Amazon) and they've spent over a week running around, transforming and conquering bad guy aliens.",1219363200,,426,4.3125
3174631,4,B0017O1F34,"This is the fourth and final season of ""Ben 10"" right before the new ""Alien Force"" series that takes place five years later.  (Of course, the movie ""Race Against Time"" takes place in between, but that's besides the point.)

Season four has ten terrific episodes PLUS the original movie ""Secret of the Omnitrix"" with three different openings plus the bonus trivia version as well as some deleted scenes !  These episodes in this set include:

""Divided We Stand"" - Once again, the dastardly Dr. Animo returns to get revenge on Ben.  Ben must stop him again with a new alien hero: Ditto !

""Don't Drink the Water"" - Ben and Grandpa Max accidentally drink water from the legendary Fountain of Youth.  Now Gwen has to deal with a young  Max and an infantile Ben.

""Ken 10"" - Fast-forward into the distant future where the adult Ben 10,000 gives his son Kenny his very own Omnitrix.  But like his father, Kenny has much to learn on how it's used.

""Ben 10 vs. The Negative 10"" - An epic two-parter where Ben faces ten of his most villainous of villains.  It's gonna take more than the Omnitrix to save him now.

So that about wraps up the series of young Ben and his planetary heroics, but don't get cocky just yet.  There are more brand-new episodes of the new ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" on Cartoon Network's ""Dynamite Action Squad"" every Saturday AND the first half of the first season will be available this fall !  So stay tuned.",1219017600,5,1421,4.49609375

3174666,5,B0017O1F34,This is a great series.. sad that they finish with the fourth season. But Ben 10 Alien Force is great too.. so Keep watching Ben 10.. there is more for the fans,1241049600,,160,4.03125
3174667,5,B0017O1F34,"We find out in Season 4 that there are alot of alien races out there that are fighting one another for control of the galaxy. As we all know, there is one 10 year old kid that ain't going to let that happen and that is Ben Tennyson. Season Four opens up with Ben living out a perfect day, perhaps too perfect-I'm afraid- as he soon discovers and things escalate from there. While most of the episodes walk a familiar ground, the plot thickens more as you soon discover before the Season is over. Team Tennyson may be no more. As for extras, we are given three alternate versions of the Ben 10 Secret of the Omnitrix movie. While each version has minor changes(different heroes used to combat the enemy, a pop up trivia version for fans, etc), they are still worth watching. I'm glad Cartoon Network included this movie with Season Four(it makes one less thing I have to buy in order to have the complete Ben 10 Collection).  Other than that, nothing much to speak of.

While I'm older than the audience this series was created for, I can honestly say that it appeals to me too. See, Ben is living every kid's dream of being a hero and I think that is what appeals to fans of the show, including me. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a real hero?? Besides, the cartoon is fun with lots of twists and turns in the storyline. With all the aliens that Ben turns into and the things that he faces, that makes for alot of episode possibilites.

If you're into Ben 10 Alien Force, you owe it to yourself to pick up the series that started it all: Ben 10. I'll admit, I wasn't much of a fan til I saw the new show. The series is definitely worth picking up.

Now, it is time for me to pick up Volume One of Ben 10 Alien Force.",1231200000,8,1716,4.206686930091186

My kid loves Ben 10 and these are a fun collection, especially to take on trips.  We don't get Ben 10 on our television so these are a special treat.

Also, the DVD isn't filled with tons of advertising for other products, which is a big PLUS.",1319500800,,370,4.575757575757576

3409164,5,B0017O1F34,"We find out in Season 4 that there are alot of alien races out there that are fighting one another for control of the galaxy. As we all know, there is one 10 year old kid that ain't going to let that happen and that is Ben Tennyson. Season Four opens up with Ben living out a perfect day, perhaps too perfect-I'm afraid- as he soon discovers and things escalate from there. While most of the episodes walk a familiar ground, the plot thickens more as you soon discover before the Season is over. Team Tennyson may be no more. As for extras, we are given three alternate versions of the Ben 10 Secret of the Omnitrix movie. While each version has minor changes(different heroes used to combat the enemy, a pop up trivia version for fans, etc), they are still worth watching. I'm glad Cartoon Network included this movie with Season Four(it makes one less thing I have to buy in order to have the complete Ben 10 Collection).  Other than that, nothing much to speak of.

While I'm older than the audience this series was created for, I can honestly say that it appeals to me too. See, Ben is living every kid's dream of being a hero and I think that is what appeals to fans of the show, including me. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a real hero?? Besides, the cartoon is fun with lots of twists and turns in the storyline. With all the aliens that Ben turns into and the things that he faces, that makes for alot of episode possibilites.

If you're into Ben 10 Alien Force, you owe it to yourself to pick up the series that started it all: Ben 10. I'll admit, I wasn't much of a fan til I saw the new show. The series is definitely worth picking up.

Now, it is time for me to pick up Volume One of Ben 10 Alien Force.",1231200000,8,1716,4.206686930091186
