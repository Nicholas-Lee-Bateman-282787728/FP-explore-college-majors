If you own or have seen much of what is available at Amazon or elsewhere you've already seen most of the footage in this tape. The music wasn't too bad except that there was no dialog, just the music, I got tired of seeing the Princess or someone else say something and not being able to listen to them.",996537600,3,399,4.194805194805195
7906233,2,B00000F0KU,"This video has some good pictures of Diana, but it is only a bunch of pictures and some music that plays as you watch.  Not worth more the big bucks unless this is the only video you need to complete your collection.  A&E Biography is a much better choice, or the Legacy of a Princess.",939859200,11,285,4.163636363636364
