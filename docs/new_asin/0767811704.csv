10919,3,0767811704,"This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.

This is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.

Gary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.

Jackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.

If you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.

An underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.",1155600000,8,1823,4.509090909090909
10920,3,0767811704,"Tom Hanks plays an successful advertising agent. His life is running smoothly until his mother leaves his father. Then his dad loses his job. He's trying to help both out but his relationship with his dad is rocky. Family problems start to effect his work. It's about how Hank's character handles this new development and also the the relationships of the two women in his life. One, the daughter of the owner of the airline and the other an childhood sweetheart he's still friends with.

This movie started out slow so I'm thinking I'm going to be disappointed. Finally, the story picks up and it gets interesting. I think with better editing this could have been a very good movie instead of just okay.",1155081600,2,704,4.67741935483871
10921,3,0767811704,"Tom Hanks is the young yuppie in Chicago who is a big hot-shot ad man, and Jackie Gleason (in his last screen role) is his father who has just lost his meager job and is facing divorce. Gleason comes across as most unlovable, and the conflict between Hanks and him produces quite a bit of noise. The selfish Hanks has to make some sacrifices for his father, as expected--there's the message. The movie tries to do too much, though, and not much of it in any depth. It's all surface.",1110844800,2,482,4.366666666666666
10922,4,0767811704,"""Nothing in Common"" is Tom Hanks' first dramatic role (though there are plenty of comedic moments) and Jackie Gleason's last movie role.  Both do a fine job as a father and son who really have no use and less understanding of each other.  Of course, there is a crisis (actually a series of crises) that forces them to choose further alienation or reconciliation.  You will have to watch the movie to find out - and I encourage you to do so.

Tom Hanks plays David Basner, a young and talented up-and-coming ad executive.  He is in all ways the flower of the YUPPIE ethos including the pre-AIDS casual attitude towards sex and relationships.  Gleason plays Max Basner who is a way past his prime manufacturers rep for a children's clothes manufacturer.  Max is by all accounts a difficult and angry man who used to be quite a charmer and ladies man.

Eva Marie Saint plays Lorraine Basner.  Lorraine was trapped into a marriage some would call loveless, but it is much more complicated than that.  Again, you will have to watch the movie to learn all the subtleties, but during the film she decides to break free and ""find herself"" by walking out of her home and marriage to file for divorce and get the first job of her life.  Both Max and Lorraine begin relying on David in ways that reverse the parent - child relationship and put a real strain and the solo life and upward career path David is enjoying.

To complete the sea of troubles, David is in the middle of trying to land a huge airline deal for his firm that would likely make him a partner and has also developed a mutual attachment with Cheryl Ann Wayne (played by the amazing Sela Ward) who is important on the airline account for multiple reasons.  Plus, there is the old friend who really needs to be more, Donna Martin, played wonderfully by Bess Armstrong.

Some have criticized the movie as having two minds.  The stuff at the office is fun, raucous, aggressive, and often very funny.  The Basner family saga is often very painful.  I actually found the clash of these two stories more or less realistic.  Many young professionals experience a much different life at work than at home and that leads to a lot of stress, broken marriages, and lots of counseling hours.

While I am not thrilled with all the choices the characters make along the way, I do think the movie ends in a good place - though some might find it maudlin.  In my view, the character that comes off best is Charlie Gargas, David's Boss, played by the always effective Hector Elizondo.

Other reasons to view the film again are the very young and pre- Homer Simpson Dan Castellaneta, the now strange 80's fashions, and the wonderful exchanges between David Basner and the deadpan secretary, and Conrad Janis on trombone with his jazz band (however briefly).

I think the best reason to see the film is the performance delivered by Jackie Gleason.  It is a tour de force of how to provide humanity to such an unsympathetic character.  There is much subtlety and skill in his portrayal of Max Basner and it is very memorable.",1101859200,9,3062,4.576146788990826
10923,4,0767811704,"I've watched this movie dozens of times, and was overjoyed to find it on DVD at last.  This was (I believe) The Great One Jackie Gleason's final screen performance, and it showed the way of the future for Tom Hanks.  Sela Ward also appears as a love interest, along with Hector Elizondo as his boss, and Eva Marie Saint as Hanks' mom.

The only thing that gets on my nerves just a little is the soundtrack.  I think it's Christopher Cross, surely one of the most annoying alleged musicians ever to hit the big time.

The transfer to disk is good.  The cast is excellent.  The plot makes sense, and the script is near perfect.  The story is about the relationship between Tom Hanks' character, David Basner, and his father, Max Basner.  Its a wonder that anyone comes out right as an adult, and Hanks had no idea how screwed up his childhood had been until the night his father told him his mother had split.  And soon thereafter his secretary gave him a message that his mother had called, and added ""I had no idea you had parents.""

10924,5,0767811704,"I found Nothing in Common to have all the attributes of a wonderful film.  From its soundtrack to its cast.  The subject, a selfish advertising executive, thinks only of himself, but finally learns that family is important, and old friends are the best.

10925,5,0767811704,"This is one of my most treasured films of all time and I can't understand why it receives so little attention. This is the story of an immature but successful bachelor whose world is disrupted when he gets an unexpected call from his estranged father, telling him his mother left him. Tom Hanks gives one of his BEST performances (comedically AND dramatically) as the carefree fellow who is forced to get to know his parents all over again while supporting them emotionally.
While many label this a comedy--and it IS pretty funny-- I find it one of the most heartfelt and touching films ever thanks to a brilliant director, soppy but appropriate music, and an extraordinary cast. There've been so many films made concerning father-son relationships but if you're looking for the most genuinely realistic one, this is it. The final line of dialogue spoken by father to son (""You're the last person on earth I would've ever expected to come through for me"") never fails to choke me up.",1032134400,22,983,4.788235294117647

The only reasons I can even give it three stars is that the supporting actors all fare a little bit better and the attempt to show family being more important than career hits it's bullseye.

The film has a bunch of good laughs (especially by Jackie Gleason and Tom Hanks.) I don't have any problems with the film. But, the topic of having to put one's job on hold, divorce, and having a family member with a severe illness is very stressful. Since the film talks about diabetes, Jackie Gleason had diabetes in real life and didn't take good care of himself. But, I'm not going to go on about that. The film is just nicely done and a good closing film for an iconic figure (Jackie Gleason). The moral that I learned from this hilariously underrated comedy of the 1980s is that even though someone has an important job to do at work, that certain person has to look after members of their own family since that's an important responsibility and Tom Hanks was smart enough to do just that.",1420070400,,957,4.443181818181818

11023,3,0767811704,"I am a big fan of Mr. Hanks and I am old enough to have watched and enjoyed many hours of ""The great one"" on television.  Both are very talented in their own ways.  I had not seen this film till today.  Not even sure why I suddenly wanted to watch it.  This is early in Hanks career and the semi-manic, rapid fire manner in which he juggles his way through a scene is already firmly in his grasp.  He is fun to watch.  The script is where I would prefer to focus my criticism because the actors were all quite fine.

There are other write-ups that will identify this as one of the best father - son relationship movies, ever.  I would hardly cast my vote that way.  For example, one of the most scorched earth movies that is everything that this film is not, ""Affliction"" with Nick Nolte and the late James Coburn is a smouldering, simmering volcanic dynamo.  ""Nothing in common"" by comparison is way too kosher, safe and aimed for middle America, taking very few risks and staying rather formulaic.  The comparison I draw might be unfair because there are many other father son movies and plays that far outshine this film.  For example ""Death of a salesman"", perhaps the greatest of them all, is an invitation to examine the dark side of family traffic.  Nothing in Common, watched now in 2014, seems by comparison to be a product of its time.  It suffers from not taking the emotional risks that real families in deep distress actually live through.

Gleason was robbed all his life of enough dramatic roles.  While a wonderful television icon he excelled in the very few really meaty dramatic roles and sadly we got to see too little of that.  In this film he is not given enough room to stretch his personality beyond the crabby old and sick man that he has become.  His character is not allowed to share the grief he continues to bottle up.  You spend a few minutes watching the interactions in ""Affliction"" and you can see what better scripts and raw gestalt can do for dramatic effect.

I think that this film suffers from trying to be two things at once: a very light comedy and a light weight drama.  It would have been better served, in my view, by sticking with one version and strengthening the focus.  These were actors who could perform, all of them and its a shame that they were not allowed to show the pains of family stresses in a more forthright manner.

I don't want to say that the film has aged badly.  It is a product of a Hollywood system that pushes product downstream into the market and cares much less about making bold statements.  By the reckoning of my own tastes, I enjoy a more visceral drama, one in which there is danger lurking beneath the rising blood pressure.  Will something suppressed, something urgent finally be said?  In fairness the strength of the film is in the last 20 minutes where the dramatic heat comes as close to a boil as the script allows.  I found myself sitting quietly and barely moved at all throughout the viewing.  It is a tepid affair and I would not recommend it too much, especially in light of what Tom Hanks went on to.  I needed to see something more substantial here;  perhaps I had nothing in common with the film?",1409702400,2,3185,4.449050086355786

Tom Hanks wasn't nearly as big (no pun intended) then as now, and I still thought of him first from ""Bosom Buddies"" back then.  Gleason does a great job as the cranky curmudgeon old father, and Hanks plays what was, for him at that time, his signature goofy smart alec persona.

There's some great laughs in it, but it's really a great emotional movie as well, it covers quite a bit of ground.  This is one of the first movies I remember seeing that really fit the ""emotional rollercoaster"" description.

The quality of video and sound was better than I had anticipated considering how long ago it was made.

All told, it's a great deal for a great movie.  This is one of the movies from the 80's I was very happy to see come out in Blu-ray so I could add a good HQ version to my movie collection.",1406246400,3,876,4.209580838323354
11026,4,0767811704,"A very young Tom Hanks stars as David, an up and coming ad executive in Chicago who plays hard and works hard. He has just been promoted to a window office, and  everything seems to be going perfectly until his father, played by Jackie Gleason, announces that his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint, has moved out. Jackie Gleason plays himself - a cigar chewing, joking, clothing salesman who has lost his edge and can no longer adapt to new sales methods and is losing clients until the firm eventually fires him.

David walks the tightrope between his grumpy, ailing father and his mother who wants to start a new life with someone who will love and pay attention to her. He finds out more about their relationship than he ever wanted to know in some rather emotional scenes.

Out of a sense of responsibility, Hanks tries to take care of his father, urging him to go to the doctor for his failing eyesight. Meanwhile, Hanks is working on a campaign for a major airlines and wooing the sexy hard-working daughter of the chairman of the airlines. He is torn between the demands of his job and his family, though his dad is irascible and demanding and ungrateful and his mother can't forgive his father for a lifetime of neglect and antipathy.

David learns a lot from his parents' marriage and from the other relationships in his life and matures considerably throughout the film. By the end, he's more than just a womanizing, hard-charging prankster ad executive. The ensemble cast (Eva Marie Saint,  Hector Elizondo,  Barry Corbin,  Bess Armstrong,  Sela Ward,) is quite impressive, ensuring that watching this nearly 30 year old film will be an enjoyable experience.

11027,3,0767811704,"Jackie Gleason, in his final film role, plays the icy, stonewalling father of a hyperactive, professional Tom Hanks. There's a good message at the core of this one, about the impenetrable veneer expected of men from his generation and the dire effects it bore on those around him. Hanks, a smooth-talking corporate '80s ad exec, and Gleason, a foot-to-pavement salesman struggling to deal with the end of his career, manage well with the heavy stuff while occasionally injecting a few welcome dashes of humor and sarcasm to the mix. The film is flawed, though, in its unbridled lack of restraint. Every last supporting character hints at a big, convoluted back story and many of them are halfheartedly explored. That diverts attention away from the key players and leaves us with what seems like one big, fuzzy, unfocused batch of incomplete or unfulfilling arcs. There's simply too much to keep track of, and too much time wasted with characters we don't care about. Noteworthy as the stage where Hanks showed he could be more than just a comic player, but otherwise it's too overstuffed and vague to recommend.",1404172800,,1112,4.951871657754011

11068,5,0767811704,"Nothing In Common is one of those underrated 80s films that is
forgotten but had plenty of heart. It is a favorite movie of mine.

The film, released in 1986, was not a great financial success, but it
became more popular as Hanks's fame grew. It is considered by some to
be a pivotal role in Hanks's career because it marked his transition
from less developed comedic roles to becoming a leading actor in more
serious stories, while many critics also praised Gleason's performance,
which was his last movie. The original music score was composed by
Patrick Leonard. The film was marketed with the tagline ""On his way up
the corporate ladder, David Basner confronts his greatest challenge:
his father."" Happy-go-lucky advertising executive David Basner, who
recently got a promotion at his Chicago ad agency, returns to work from
a vacation. He is utterly carefree until his parents split up after 36
years of marriage.

Out of the blue, he must care for his aging, bitter father Max (played
by Gleason), as well as be there for his emotionally fragile mother,
Lorraine (played by Eva Marie Saint). To add insult to injury, Max has
just been fired from his 35-year career in the garment industry.

At work, David is developing a commercial for Colonial Airlines, owned
by the rich and eccentric Andrew Woolridge. A successful ad campaign
would likely promote David to partner in his company. David develops a
relationship with Woolridge's daughter, no-nonsense Cheryl Ann Wayne.
His father is well aware of David's playboy nature. Asking at one point
if his son is in bed with a woman, Max adds: ""Anybody you know?"" The
parents begin to rely more and more on David, calling him on the phone
constantly. His mother needs help moving to a new apartment. His father
needs to be driven to an eye doctor. Lorraine needs to be rescued in a
bar after going out on a date with another man, having become
frightened when he tried to kiss her goodnight.

David's mother then confides to him that Max cheated on her and
humiliated her. An enraged David goes to confront Max. Their argument
ends with David saying: ""Tomorrow I'm shooting a commercial about a
family who loves each other, who cares about each other. I'm fakin'
it."" The next day, David is distracted by the deteriorating
relationship with his dad and it affects his work. As a peace offering,
David offers to take Max to a nightclub to hear some of the jazz music
Max likes. It is there that David accidentally discovers a secret Max
has been hiding: diabetes. His foot is gangrened.

Max must go to the hospital. While awaiting surgery, he and Lorraine
share their thoughts about their life together, with Lorraine
condemning him for doing what he did to himself and to her. Max sobs
over his mistakes once he is alone.

At the agency, Andrew Woolridge insists that David go to New York with
him to promote his new ad campaign. David refuses, saying he wants to
stay with his sick father. Woolridge complains that it's unnecessary.
David tells him off and is fired.

The next day, David accompanies his dad to the operating room. His boss
Charlie assures him that he will personally smooth things over with
Woolridge, so David should take some time off.

Max loses two toes. When he goes home from the hospital, David pushes
his wheelchair. Max admits to his son: ""You were the last person I
thought would come through for me."" Even though I consider this film
forgotten and underrated, it is available on DVD. It is worth the $5
for the DVD just to see the genius of Jackie Gleason one more time...",1341360000,,3553,4.70096463022508

He was a great man/comedian and I loved watching him.  I felt the film dwelled too much on Tom Hank's character playing around, etc. and I just wanted to see more of Gleason I guess.  Good film though and the ending is heartening.",1272585600,,382,4.191780821917808
11072,3,0767811704,"I was pretty worried going into Nothing In Common earlier tonight.  I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.

I still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.

However, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).

The first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.

The film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as ""beautiful"" and ""fitting the mood"".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.

At least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.",1269993600,,1903,4.721212121212122

11077,4,0767811704,"Before he went all soporific on everybody. Before he made the ill-advised ""Philadelphia"" and then the cleverer ""Forrest Gump"", Hanks was actually a fairly broad comic actor. Some of his movies hit the mark, like ""Splash"" and ""The Money Pit"", and others bombed badly, like ""The Man With One Red Shoe"" and ""Bachelor Party"". He was great at playing overly-confident, affable yuppies that were almost always put-upon in the extreme or finding themselves in odd situations, like he did in this one.

In this movie, Hanks plays David Basner, a hotshot adman in Chicago, with comical co-workers and upper-middle-aged parents that are breaking up. While he tries romancing the daughter of a major client, (Sela Ward, hubba-hubba!) he also has to deal with his poor father (Jackie Gleason) losing his wife of 40 years and his job, all within the same month! The ""tough love"" tenderness Basner uses with his dad is offset by the kid gloves he uses with his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint. There are some ingenious comic scenes in this film, such as the ad company presentation to the Texan airline owner client, father of the Sela Ward character, (the woman with the guitar voicing the old lady on the plane is priceless,) and some other ad proposals are done well too. However, it is the later scenes with Max, his father, that will probably get to you the most. This was Jackie Gleason's last movie, and it is LIGHT YEARS better than most of the stuff he starred in late in his career, specifically the ""Smokey & The Bandit"" movies and ""The Sting II"". Hanks would go on to make ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", which was really Meg Ryan's movie more than his, his last broad comedy, and then made ""A League of Their Own"", which changed his career as well as saved it. There was no looking back after ""Philadelphia"", which was actually his first totally dramatic role.

Frankly, I kinda miss the affable yuppy Hanks and would love to see him in another ""Money Pit"".
