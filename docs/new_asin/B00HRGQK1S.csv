8634799,3,B00HRGQK1S,"I have to say I got this DVD just for the theme alone. It's an all TNA Knockouts ppv where the TNA Knockouts compete in singles matches in order to advance into the Gauntlet Main event.

None of the matches are particularly impressive and rarely pass the 10-minute mark, but it's decent. Got to see divas like Jacqueline and Jillian Hall in the ring again. And the main event is pretty awesome. I'd call this a very ""Relaxing"" TNA event to just have on and watch every once in a while. May want to try and get it for cheap, but not bad.",1404432000,2,536,4.203883495145631

Miss Sojo Bolt is in  3 way match between the english girl and taler hendrix, albeit Miss Sojo dosen't do as well as I had hoped she would she does do her best.",1403568000,2,278,4.054545454545455
8634801,3,B00HRGQK1S,"The Gail Kim-Alissa Flash match was too long but still good. The Lei'D Tapa-Ivelisse Velez match was not geat but pretty good. The Tara-Mia Yim match was a perfectly acceptable bout even though it wasn't booked to show Yim's strengths. The Miss Tessmacher-Santana Garrett match was solid but not spectacular. The ODB-Trinity match was laid out well and with a lot of energy to boot. The Hannah Blossom-Sojo Bolt-Taeler Hendrix-3 way match was fine at best. The Velvet Sky-Jillian Hall match was like the movie Showgirls,a flop. The Mickie James-Serena Deeb match was a very good and physical bout. The 9 Women Queen of TNA Gauntlet match was good for a Gauntlet match but still good none the less. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1394409600,3,728,4.6953125
8634802,3,B00HRGQK1S,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  This edition is based around the Knockouts division hosted by Brooke Hogan where women from the past & present along with those known in other companies come in to compete in matches with the winners advancing to a gauntlet battle royal with the winner being crowned by new ""Queen Of The Knockouts"" by Madison Rayne (who didn't participant due to her pregnancy at the time) with Mike Tenay & Taz doing commentary on this show.  It should also be noted that various knockout moments are shown throughout the show such as Gail Kim becoming the first Knockouts Champion, Tara introducing her ""Hollywood Boo"" Jesse, a long look at the new Knockouts website, Ms. Tessmacher's first Knockouts Title win, O.D.B.'s wedding to Eric Young, and Mickie James' first Knockouts Title win.

Alyssa Flash (Cheerleader Melissa) vs. Gail Kim - Both women were evenly matched early on as they either had a counter to the other's offense like a headlock takeover into a grounded leg head scissors or exchanging moves such as a running dropkick & german suplex & strikes using their fist & forearms along with submissions from the octopus & standing leg deathlock while also taking using the same moves against each other such as a top rope missile dropkick.  A very competitive match & definitely the best one Alyssa has ever had in TNA dating back to her Raisha Saaed days.

Ivelisse vs. Lei'D Tapa - This was a rematch from their ""Gut Check"" match on Impact while it should be noted that Tapa is the niece of The Barbarian & showed a superior power advantage taking her down with stiff strikes & whips in the corner along while Ivelisse kept attempting to hit & move only to keep getting caught resulting in her going aerial with a head scissors takeover & dive to the outside along with a guillotine choke submission.  They told a very good story of this being a female ""David vs. Goliath"" encounter & better than I remember their previous televised match being.

Mia Yim vs. Tara - Tara had Jesse at ringside as they started off exchanging takedowns with each other through hip tosses & slams & armdrags before Kim got the advantage early coming off the second rope with a dropkick while Tara used her power advantage only for Kim to come back with a springboard moonsault & bridge suplex.  This was one of those matches that you saw had potential but was too short with Jesse on the outside causing distractions on more than one occasion that hurt the match more than it helped.

Miss Tessmacher vs. Santana Garrett - Santana started off this match with a strong amount of offense from various kicks & headbutts to a unique abdominal stretch & fujiara armbar before Tess came back with clotheslines & flying forearm but Santana came right back with moves that look like they came out of the playbook of japanese legend Great Muta.  While Santana's first short run in TNA with Orlando Jordan was easily forgettable, she definitely left a very strong impression after this match.

Trinity vs. O.D.B. - O.D.B. started off in control causing Trinity to move outside to slow the momentum down only for O.D.B. to take the brawl to the outside before Trinity was able to take advantage of mistiming by O.D.B. who was able to regain the momentum back with her ""liquid courage"" in what was an average match.

Taryn Terrell vs. Jackie Moore - Both women started out strong with punches with Jackie taking control yanking her down by her hair & ramming her face into turnbuckle while later giving a dropkick straight to the face only for Taryn to come back with more impactful moves such as a dropkick & crossbody & spear.  Another match that had potential but ended quickly just when it started to pick up momentum.

Taeler Hendrix vs. Hannah Blossom vs. Sojournor Bolt - Blossom was the odd woman out here as Hendrix & Bolt decided to work together including a page out of the Benoit/Jericho playbook with a dual submission on the top & bottom parts of her body before the fact that only one woman could win the match caused them to turn on each other with Hannah being able to take advantage of both women focusing on each other.  This was a nice match with the story they were telling.

Velvet Sky vs. Jillian Hall - Jillian did her bad singer gimmick from WWE as Velvet took control ramming her head into each turnbuckle & the apron along with spearing both of them out of the ring before Jillian used the ringside steps to her advantage & applying a backbreaker while also attempting Velvet's own ""In Your Face"" finisher.  This was pretty short & sweet in what was more of a Velvet Sky offensive exhibition than anything else.

Serena Deeb vs. Mickie James - Both women showed mutual respect to each other at the start of the match before both women had such a strong lockup that it took both women down on more than one occasion as both women didn't let down with Mickie doing a strong headlock takeover only for Serena to counter & do a headlock takeover of her own going into a series of counters & trading various takedowns & armdrags & pin attempts ending on a stalemate on more than one occasion before both women ended up sending the other to the outside as things started to get more intense that one took advantage of the mutual respect they had to gain an advantage.  This was one of the most physical knockouts matches in recent history outside of the Kim/Terrell series with both men being very evenly matched throughout the entire match with this one match leaving a stronger impression on Serena than she ever had in her WWE career while this was one of Mickie's best matches in her TNA career.

Gauntlet Match: This was held under ""Royal Rumble"" rules held between all the winners of the previous matches throughout the night with the highlights being one knockout going the distance, the dominance of one knockout to the point where Mike Tenay compared her to Andre The Giant, former Knockout Tag Team Champions reuniting, the fight that happened on the apron, and when it got down to the final two.

While this PPV was themed around the TNA Knockouts, the strongest & longer lasting impressions came from those who weren't under contract & brought in just for this event such as Ivelisse, Alyssa Flash, Santana Garrett & Serena Deeb while Gail Kim & Mickie James also had some of the strongest showings of their career here.  There were some fillers & matches that were disappointing but nothing unwatchable so in the end, I recommend this if your a fan at all of womens wrestling.",1389225600,3,6691,4.6525423728813555
