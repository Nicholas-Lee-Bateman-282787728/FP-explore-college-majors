8457239,4,B00551QQD4,"Fine doc. about one of the many small circuses throughout the world struggling to keep their way of life viable. Good,talented and hardworking people. Very different existence than mundane town life.  Hopefully the small circuses of the world will never strike tents for the last time.",1504396800,,285,5.195652173913044
8457240,4,B00551QQD4,"This film, like its characters, feels like its standing at a threshold between a world nearly gone and a future uncertain. The filmmakers do a phenomenal job of gaining the trust of the Ponce family and we get as unvarnished a look at their life as anyone could hope for. It's a simple story, told many times before, yet its compelling. It's shot and edited beautifully and Calexico's score complements it perfectly.

Great stuff.",1504137600,,430,4.8108108108108105
8457241,4,B00551QQD4,"I never thought about how a small circus could survive. I've been aware of big circuses, the ones with train cars, crews, and sponsors. This circus is different - it's a small family circus travelling around Mexico. I admire the family's hard work and dedication. Most of all, I admire the children and their efforts for the circus - whether that be putting up the tent or lights, carrying equipment, helping train animals, learning contortions, juggling, or other circus acts. The circus life is a different world. Unfortunately, I don't think the kids are getting much of a formal education.",1350172800,,593,4.94
8457242,5,B00551QQD4,"Through the hard work of the director and the Ponce family's Circo Mexico how easy it is through this DVD documentary to learn another lesson about how we all share the same dreams and the human willingness to achieve them. Circo Mexico and other circuses of a similar nature offer a real and a positive entertainment for people, easily forgotten, that makes TV and film seem shallow in comparison. Kudos to them in their efforts and to director Schock for his courageous effort to document this piece of history.",1320969600,3,513,4.775280898876405
8457243,5,B00551QQD4,"My people, not drug cartels! Because of the cartels and violence everybody think, we are all like that, which isn't true at all! Mexicans are hard working people! There is so many stupid movies out there. This movie is worth watching because is about LIFE with winners not whiners.",1316736000,7,281,4.755102040816326
