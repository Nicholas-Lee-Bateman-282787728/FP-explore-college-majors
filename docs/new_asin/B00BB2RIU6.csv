8565160,5,B00BB2RIU6,"An outstanding film. A one-hour video narrative that explores the often treaded line between social politics and major/professional sports, noted journalist Dave Zirin strongly argues that there really is no line, that there never was a line and that based on todays culture of huge sports endorsement contracts, there never will be a line. The outside world influence of money and advertising on todays top athletes is palpable and this documentary becomes a powerful referendum examining that very subject.

Beginning with the notion that societys ideal of sports, in its most basic and carnal structure, was formed from a wrong-headed, stereotypical myth, one that led to the belief that all its participants must meet a certain macho/male stereotype, Zirin points out that when this culture actually took off, it had an amazingly immediate reverse effectif the normal male couldn't somehow meet this new sports minded/athletic model even in ordinary society, he was then looked down upon as not being suddenly manly. Taking it a step further, and if you were indeed now a player, you were then subjected to and expected to exude behavior that was in a physical class far above the ordinary male counterpart. You were now expected to be literally almost beyond human, to play tough and be a man while walking it off or playing through injuries. Within this mindset, Zirin discusses the now widely prevalent nature of post NFL career concussive disorders and how fundamentally life shortening and mind altering they have become, especially for still relatively young men.

Women in sport receive a welcome scrutinization from Zirin here as wellrecalling many amazingly misogynistic reports from as recent as the 1950s, we observe the current explosion of womens sports as it traces back to the powerful womens political movement of the 1960s and 70s. Focusing on the strident character of Billie Jean King, Zirin not only points to her role in the fight for equality in contemporary society but also her appearances in high profile and prominent world tennis positions as well, with the legendary and ultimately farcical 1973 match with Bobby Riggs as the centerpiece. Watching many of the King interviews in that lead up to the match, we learn that it wasn't so farcical to her at all and how important it was for her to win if she were to continue to have any subsequent credibility in the womans rights movement. These scenes also, even now, strike a chord of admiration for this womans pride and strength of character, especially as Zirin segues into his next topical point.

The disclosure that she had an affair with her female assistant rocked the tennis world in 1981. A virtual non sequitur, of course, in todays society, it nevertheless stresses how far weve come from that archaic ethos. Zirin then segues into stories delving into many professional athletes whove subsequently come out across all spectrums of sport. But because ignorance still exists, coupled with the lack of desire of a select few in prominent and/or influential positions to understand or learn, we then hear and see horrifyingly misanthropic examples of this senselessnessfirst from Tim Hardaway (the senior) and then Jeremy Shockey, both who embarrassingly spout pre-conceived and hopelessly ill-informed homophobic rhetoric, totally reinforcing their clear lack of intellect on a subject they claim to know so much about.

But perhaps the most profound segments of this film deal with the racial in-equalities that have defined professional sports since their inception. Zirin talks extensively about Jackie Robinsons breakthrough with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 and what indignities he was forced to endure to remain within the league. Referencing a disappointing and morosely disparaging 1950 film attempt at a feel good biopic (one which actually starred Jackie himself), were dealt an overt amount of early, pre-civil rights panoply of the stereotypical black man working hard to overcome the forces of inequality to establish his place in the white mans world.

With Mom, Apple Pie and Norman Rockwell solely entrenched as the central theme of this misguided Robinson movie, were then quickly spirited to the turbulent mid 1960s when the Civil Rights movement had become a central force. Interspersing a suddenly (and refreshingly) militant, post-baseball Robinson with contemporarily familiar exhorts from Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Zirin introduces Muhammed Alis saga with the fight for black freedom. Providing a kaleidoscope of scenes brilliantly encompassing Robinson expressing his extreme exhaustion with the continued fight and with numerous Ali interviews and confrontations up to and following his conviction for draft evasion in 1967, Zirin formidably establishes a passing of the torch sort of moment as he builds Ali as the new Martyr, the one who would shun millions of dollars for the cause.

Supplementing this period of black suppression comes easily my favorite and perhaps the most compelling part of the film. Chronicling the effect that the Black Power Movement had already established throughout the country during this period, we then witness its effect on the coming 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City. Nearly boycotted by all the U.S. black athletes in an effort predominantly led by California Sociologist Dr. Harry Edwards, who was then the head of an organization entitled the Olympic Project for Human Rights, the boycott subsequently fell through due to an un-unified front. Edward's most loyal charges, supported by strong black sports leaders of the time like Bill Russell, Jim Brown and Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), were instead advised to administer protests as they saw fit.

Tommie Smith, one of the favorites for a 200 meter medal and Lee Evans the odds on favorite for the 400 meter gold were clear and outspoken leaders on the team, athletes who were consistently thinking of profound ways to show their protest against a country that had seemingly no difficulty sending blacks or other minorities to either serve in Vietnam to ""protect democracy"" or to compete in and win major sports events on a global stage and to uphold the Superior Athletic Standing of the United States throughout the world, but, upon their return home, be continually subjugated as inferior citizens, without any of the chances or opportunities to succeed that their contemporaries of the white race had.

Determined, Smith and John Carlos, a fellow advocate for boycott and the actual winner of the 200 meter finals at the Olympic Trials while setting a disputed world record, come up with a multi-layered approach to protest these numerous minority injustices while on the winners podium. All they had to do, of course, was place in the top three in the finals. This soon became a tenuous situation for in the final 200 meter qualifying heat, Smith, while still winning that heat, pulled up limping and then staggering, needing assistance. Hed painfully pulled an adductor muscle in his left leg and with the 200 meter finals only two hours away, he'd need some serious treatment to compete.

With an ice pack and full wrap, he waited until only thirty minutes prior to the start of the finals before going to the practice track to test it outrunning at thirty, fifty and ninety percent of full effort, he suddenly felt confident that it would hold. Back in the stadium and with over 80,000 in attendance, the gun went off. Carlos, as expected, exploded into an early lead with Smith holding back to protect his leg for as long as he could as they entered the turn. Now into the straightaway, Smith then seemed to shift into another gear, accelerating mightily past Carlos who seemed to have second place locked up until little Peter Norman of Australia nipped him at the tape. It was a new world record for Smith who would have likely set it even lower had he not slowed to raise his arms in triumph.

Huddling with Carlos in the tunnel before the medal ceremony, they agreed upon their plan. They would walk to the podium shoeless, carrying their black Puma track shoes, exposing their black socks as a symbol of black poverty. Smith had adorned a black scarf representing black pride, Carlos had his jacket unzipped to acknowledge blue collar workers across the United States. He also wore a bead necklace to symbolize the blacks whod been lynched or otherwise tortured and/or killed in the name of the fight for Civil Rights. Smith wore a black glove on his right hand and Carlos on his leftafter receiving their medals and turning to their right, they both raised their respective gloved hands and held them high when the National Anthem began and held them there until it stopped.

Amid a scattering of boos and catcalls, Smith and Carlos then left the stadium to face immediate suspension and expulsion from the Olympic Village by socially and culturally ignorant IOC President Avery Brundage, to return to the United States to find the same sociological climate that they had been protesting. Unable to find meaningful jobs, both men would struggle for years before becoming stabilized, an egregious treatment for two of the most brave and honest spokesmen of a generation. By contrast, Lee Evans, who'd won his 400 meter final and mounted the podium with a Black Panther-like beret, quickly and disappointingly removed it when the National Anthem started, likewise his 400 meter relay teammates. Whether overcome with fear of retaliation as Smith and Carlos suffered or deluded with the emotion of victory, his and his team's lack of protest proved almost as disappointing as Smith and Carlos' act proved heroic.

Black sprinter Jim Ray Hines, one not especially in tune with the boycott and who'd won the 100 meter gold while setting a world record, was expectedly benign on the podium. Long jumper Bob Beamon the athlete who would become one of, if not THE biggest story of the Olympics, the man who'd super-humanly stretched the world record from almost twenty seven and a half feet to an astronomical 29 feet, two and one-half inches, an increase of generational proportions, was initially confused and uninformed at the notion of a boycott when he appeared at the Trials. Nevertheless though he lent his support splendidly by rolling up his track pants to bare his black socks on the podium during the National Anthem playing of his Gold Medal award.

Zirin then succinctly closes out the film by looking at these men and comparing them to contemporaries Jordan, LeBron and others who currently enjoy monster endorsement deals from the many diverse advertising agencies. We even see a rather shameful Jordan draping an American flag over his USA sweats at the 1992 gold medal awards ceremony, not for his patriotism but to instead cover the team's Reebok sponsorship, protecting his huge Nike endorsement. Taking this further, Zirin then speculates whether Jordan or LeBrons or ANY of the other high priced athletes of today would chance the loss of this fortune to do what Ali and Smith/Carlos bravely did for a social cause.

In my mind though, comparing actions from these two eras is a fools errandthere were no glorified outcomes for Smith or Carlos had they not performed their act. Conversely, if there were a Smith and Carlos today, their super talents wouldve long before been committed to a sports shoe deal prior to any of the World Classics and certainly before the start of the Olympics. The fascinating question then becomes, would either of these guys then attempt such a radically political and potentially career ending act? Granted, the United States was a far different place and social climate in 1968...my only real criticism of this film is that this realization isn't discussed further nor expanded upon at all. I believe that a more in-depth and analytical review would have led to some remarkable realizations...for example, the symbolism that Smith and Carlos are now famous for may, today, have been relegated to nothing more than Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the National Anthem. I think it deserves an intellectual look and I bet that the conclusions will look unfavorably upon today's highly paid athlete.

Other than these very mild counter-points that I bring up as ""criticism"", I believe this to be an important and sobering focus on the unquestionable link between societies major issues and how they continue to morph into the sporting world. And even as I write this, I read where LeBron refuses to stay at the Trump owned hotels in Manhattan due to his staunch political views...ahhh, it appears that the social/cultural ties to professional sports are as strong as ever.",1480809600,,12663,5.075408261287224
