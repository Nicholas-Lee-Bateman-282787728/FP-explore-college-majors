3646434,5,B001I2EQW2,"The guy who talked about using a ""karate chop"" is an idiot. First he can't spell and second using the word ""karate chop"" sounds really stupid. Its called a ""shuto uke"" or sword hand strike and serious karateka would know that!!!! Good video!",1314835200,,241,4.627906976744186
3646435,4,B001I2EQW2,"I'm always a fan of NatGeo, so they do a good job. I've always been fascinated by martial arts and its interesting to see some science get put behind it. If you're interested in a little scientific fact to crush movie-myths about combat, this is a good way to do it. The myths are by no means a comparison for the real thing.",1310083200,,325,4.174603174603175
3646436,2,B001I2EQW2,"Includes Mixed Martial Arts, Fighting Back, and Special Ops. Interesting shows, but does not include the ep that Bren Foster appeared in so very disappointing in that respect.  Wish those eps would be released as it's quite spectacular and interesting.",1307923200,15,252,5.3
3646437,2,B001I2EQW2,"As much as I enjoyed this series, I really bought it for two very brilliant episodes: the one on Stealth and the one on the Chinese Animal Styles. However, neither of those episodes are on this DVD and that is why I'm returning it. There are only 3....THREE...episodes on this disc out of the total 8 episodes. National Geographic is saying that they couldn't work out a deal with the producers of Fight Science to release more than 3 episodes. Really?! Then why bother releasing it at all when it's so incomplete?! Strangely, some portions of those other episodes are on NG's site for viewing but they're not allowed to be on the DVD? I have never heard of a TV series releasing a DVD with less than half the episodes on it. Can you imagine getting the first season of ""Lost"" and not only getting half the season's episodes but they're not even in order? Boggles the mind.

I can't believe I paid $16 for 3 episodes. You're better off watching portions of all 8 episodes on National Geographics' site for free.",1298678400,64,1011,4.524590163934426
3646438,5,B001I2EQW2,"I have 25 years in various martial arts, 11 years military, and 8 years law enforcement (6 on tactical teams). This is the best show I have ever seen on TV, and the only video of a TV series I have ever purchased. Fantastic.
It is important to realize what this video is and isn't. The reviewer who gave this a one star, completely missed the point of the show. It is not an instructional video - in fact, never, ever buy an instructional video. Go take a class from a live instructor if that is what you are after.
It merely shows what the human mind and body are cabable of. If you are a martial artist or fighter, in law enforcement, or in the military - this DVD is worth checking out. (Or just interested in the above subjects.)",1292198400,7,733,4.205673758865248
3646439,3,B001I2EQW2,"As an active martial artist, I bought this along with several other DVDs.

This DVD was okay, but personally I would recommened the Fight Quest or Human Weapon series first.  Both are a bit cheesy at times, but are more entertaining with still a bit of education to be offered.

I didn't even finish watching this DVD, but thats just me.  I guess it depends on what you are wanting.",1256515200,4,382,4.414285714285715
3646440,1,B001I2EQW2,"This DVD is SUPPOSED to teach techniques for self defense then show what the human body is capable of.

I will take the self defense portion apart first.

1. In a self defense technique the eyes ARE a valid target; but the eyes are a very small target to go after Threre are other targest that are larger, and easier to strike. sich as shoving the palm of the hand up and hit the chin (the button. as Joe Rogan calls it. a karate chop to the bridge of the nose. a karate chop to the trachea.

2 The video demonstrates two attacks to the trachea and I will refute both of them.

a. the woman who allegedly broke the cartilage of a simulated trachea. Sorry but a woman simply does not have the strength in her thumb and two fingers to break a trachea. I have been around the martial arts for 45 years and I do not have the strength in my hands to break the cartliage in a trachea. I was taught how to break a tracheaand it is NOT with a thumb and two fingers.

b. The man shows breaking a trachea by placing the edgeof one hand on the trachea and struiking this hand and driving it into the trachea by hittimg the first hand with the other hand.

According to physics the amount of impact is based on the amount of mass (the hand) with the speed of the strike.

If you really need to attack the trachea how about a karate chop that drives the trachea back and up, or hooking a thumb or finger and hitting the side of the trachea.

The video tells about the bones in the feet and explains how easily they are damaged; but the creator(s) of the video never thinks about a stomp to the instep of the foot.

The hand strike that alledgely breaks the pelvis. Get real! The pelvis are the second hardest bones in the human body.

The hands CAN and DO transmit a lot of energy; but the bones in the feet are capable of withstanding over a ton of force. A hand strike simply cannot do that. A foot strike could not do that of the Muay Thai, and MMA fighters would be leaving the ring on stretchers.

The holywood vireo ""Miss Congeniality"" has more accurate self defense techniques. In that movie Sandra Bullock explains the SING method of self defence

S=Solar Plexus. An elbow strike or a fist strike will stun the attacker temporarily and may knock their breath out.

I=Instep. stomp down on the instep hard and injure the numerous bones and ligaments in the foot. causing a lot of pain and limiting attackers mobility.

N=Nose. A fist or karate chop to the bridge of the nose (causing more pain and if you break the nose his or her breathing is going to be interrupted.

G=Groin. a knee to the groin is more pain and will stop the attacker from pursuit.

People with 0 martial art training should be about to carry ouy those four strikes in 2.5 seconds

The ONLY thing in this video that is worth anything is the practice of situational awareness.

Now the MMA segment is impresive; bit so what else would you expect Their day job is preparing for their next fight. Some of them spend 6-8 hours a day in running, boxing, submission grapling, working out in the weight room, etc. They are elite fighters.",1256256000,5,3096,4.299483648881239

3646442,5,B001I2EQW2,"The best thing about this dvd is the MMA episode, it's worth getting just for that. The other 2 are worth watching, but maybe only once.",1252108800,3,136,4.269230769230769
3646443,5,B001I2EQW2,"I would not believe some of the feats performed by the martial artists on this video were possible if I hadn't seen them here - for anyone interested in martial arts, military special forces, or human physiology, this will be extremely interesting viewing.",1238457600,9,256,4.976744186046512
