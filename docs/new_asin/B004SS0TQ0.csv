4464435,5,B004SS0TQ0,"Don't bother with this DVD if you've never once in your life bobbed your head or your knee to music, or if you've never danced in your room by yourself.  But if you've ever enjoyed being silly to music, or rocking out to music, or just closing your eyes and swaying around to music, you will have serious fun with this title -- and not that manufactured, frenetic Richard Simmons fun, or the ""fun"" of feeling like Jillian Michaels is about to eat your firstborn if you don't squat again.  This is the kind of fun you used to have when you went out dancing with friends and didn't care who was watching you because you were just there to feel the music and dance.

How do you describe this DVD to someone?  Okay, it's divided into segments of 4-5 minutes each, each set to a different song.  The styles are varied in tempo and genre of music, from soothing ambient grooves to flapper-esque Charleston music to hip hop to grungy classic rock.  You might not like every one, but you'll definitely find some you do.  Each segment has 2-3 very simple instructions from Misty, e.g. just take little steps in time with the music, or step-step-turn.  They're so simple that they leave a lot of room for interpretation, which is the whole point.  Have you ever seen any other exercise video that says that it doesn't even matter if you're looking at the screen?  It really doesn't.  Once you get the move down, you can dance all over your house.

There are several ""recommended"" routines that string together the different segments in different ways for a total of about 40-45 minutes that works every part of your body.  I never believe how quickly that time goes.  Playing with this DVD is the only time since I was about 25 that I've managed to dance for so long without once thinking about how much time has passed.  I've also just strung together a bunch of the individual songs myself when I don't have as much time, but I like the flow of her programs so I usually end up playing those.  No matter what you do, this workout is different every time... and that, combined with Misty's healthily holistic outlook on fitness, is the real beauty.",1326844800,127,2139,4.5025906735751295
4464436,5,B004SS0TQ0,"This DVD is awesome. Instead of following a strict boring workout, Misty leads us through a workout that lets us be creative and have fun. We get to move the way we want while being guided into moves that burn calories in a fun groovy way. This DVD is for anyone who is looking for something a little different in a workout.",1326844800,4,324,4.241935483870968
4464437,5,B004SS0TQ0,"I love this DVD. It is hard for me since I'm not in the greatest shape, but I can still get a great workout.",1326758400,7,108,3.5416666666666665
4464438,5,B004SS0TQ0,Great dance free-style exercises. Excellent dance routines. A great workout for all ages.  Easy on joints. Misty Tripoli is a fantastic instructor. Groovy!,1326585600,6,155,5.739130434782608
4464439,5,B004SS0TQ0,"This is completely unlike any dance DVD or class I've ever tried. Misty Tripoli offers a totally different approach when it comes to exercise. It is an experience that is fun, uplifting, freeing. You aren't worried about getting the moves ""right"" because there is no ""right"" way of grooving. You don't spend your time trying to get the steps. She introduces moves and adds on, and then before you know it, you're moving freely, without thought of perfection.

If you've never tried one of her workouts, go to her website and you can try a clip. After trying several of her ""grooves"" I had to buy this DVD. I am really enjoying them and so glad I bought them. I find that each time I do one of the workouts, I am enjoying it more. It can be a little awkward at first but once you get the hang of it, you are able to fully enjoy each dance. Each workout is unique and offers something new. It unleashes my creativity and moves me to move. Before I know it, I'm working out! There are 5 different workouts of around 30 minutes each. Or, you can choose individual dances or ""grooves"" if you want to workout for 5, 10, 15 minutes, etc. Each groove is between 3-5 minutes and you can do them in any combination. This will be something that I do a few times a week and adds to my enjoyment of getting in fitness. Very enjoyable.

A great buy! Highly recommend!",1326153600,10,1353,4.322834645669292
4464440,5,B004SS0TQ0,"You can see my full review of this on my blog: [...]

The set consists of four DVDs - Spirit Groove, Pilates Groove, Yoga Groove and Latin Groove. On the same disc as Latin Groove is a bonus abs workout. Each workout (aside from the abs workout) is around the 30 minute mark.

I can see that Spirit Groove and Latin Groove will be the ones I use the most. Both use Misty's cardio style, of using a simple movement which you can then make as intense or light as you want, all with your own style. They're more ""choreographed"" than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-Groove-Delicious-Dance-Complete-Collection/dp/B005I4T04U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body Groove Delicious Dance Complete Collection</a>, in that you build on moves and repeat that section, and only occasionally do you move around the space however you want to. But I can easily see that this was Misty starting to make Body Groove into what it is now.

Accompanied by live percussion, Spirit Groove uses your body to explore different movements, and really gets into every little part. Latin Groove is similar, but with more of a salsa/merengue flare.

I enjoyed Pilates Groove, but I don't know how often I'll use it. I love Misty's ""wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle"" way of getting you to relax and enjoy various positions, but maybe I'm just in that place where I like my Pilates to be focused and strong.

Yoga Groove provided a nice, low-key, chilled out yoga vibe (with more wiggles), which I can see myself using for those days when I just want to unwind and destress, and don't necessarily want a full-on yoga DVD experience.

The bonus abs workout is only about 5 or 6 minutes long, but I was surprised by how much I liked it. Misty gives different levels of intensity - you start out standing for some basic ab work, then move to the floor for some Pilates inspired work.",1325203200,20,1886,4.9525316455696204
4464441,5,B004SS0TQ0,"Great dance workout! It's fun & easy to follow. Misty Tripoli makes exercise fun & is a great motivator. Love it! Great for all ages. I'm a 50+ lady who exercises daily w/ walking, running, treadmill, or eliptical. Groove Dance is a great addition to my exercise choices. I recommend this to all.",1322438400,5,296,4.60377358490566
4464442,5,B004SS0TQ0,"Misty is a genius.. and a blessing.. she has changed my life forever with this DVD.. I have had (and still do that collect dust) TONS of different videos.. all the same boring, regimented crap that makes you watch the clock til your done.. stuff you MAKE yourself do b/c you need to exercise.. when you buy THIS dvd, however, you will find yourself LOOKING FORWARD to moving your body.. you will do it b/c it's fun which makes it much easier to do more and more often during the week.. Also this has 5 set workouts.. but you can piece together your OWN workout by picking individual routines out of the 32 total.. that's TONS of possible combinations all in ONE DVD. I promise you once you body groove - you won't want to go back to the old boring stuff.. You want to love and groove your body to make it the healthiest its ever been?? Buy this video.",1320278400,44,851,4.291925465838509
4464443,5,B004SS0TQ0,"I have many years of experience within the fitness industry as a student and teacher.  The Groove Method is a breath of fresh air returning the power, presence and strength to the participant as they are playfully and gently guided by Misty's voice.  Simply....JOYFUL...FUN...and effective moving the body in my own way to great music!!!  The world needs to get up and GROOVE~",1320192000,12,376,4.936507936507937
4464444,5,B004SS0TQ0,"I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT FOR MANY YRS. I LOVE THE STRUCTURED WORKOUTS.

AND, WHAT A VARIETY OF STEPS........",1340409600,5,292,4.634615384615385
4464445,5,B004SS0TQ0,"A funky, fresh take on dancing and exercise. I enjoy the freedom this video offers. If you like structure, this isn't for you, but if you like to be able to move in your own way, try it out.",1337472000,3,190,3.8974358974358974
4464446,5,B004SS0TQ0,"The word exercise makes me cringe! Now doing fun things like taking a walk with a friend, a random hike or jog, dancing the night away, these are things I call spontaneous 'actions' that my body craves in those moments. For me, Body Groove goes beyond any kind of workout, it Truly feeds my mind, body and soul...sooo amazing!",1332979200,8,326,4.5423728813559325
4464447,5,B004SS0TQ0,"This set is very fun and laid back- but you do get a great workout too! There are 2 dance workouts-Spirit Groove & Latin Groove and there are 2 mind/body workouts-Pilates Groove and Yoga Groove. The music is live dumming- I love it! I never get tired of that sound! Misty if very fun and laid back- but like I said earlier, you get a great wokout and the price is a steal for 4 full workouts! These came out before her newest offering-Delicious Dance- which is AWESOME-they are different from that- but good.  Thanks Misty for putting fun back into workouts!",1331510400,3,558,4.470588235294118
4464448,5,B004SS0TQ0,"This is an Excellent video - it was easy to follow, and fun - you can really tell she is knowledgeable and made this workout to really reach and inspire people to move, and reconnect with their bodies! This video couldn't at first be shipped to my location(Canada), but as soon as I contacted them, they immediately made that option available! Thank you!""",1329782400,9,355,4.650793650793651
4464449,4,B004SS0TQ0,"I wish I could give this DVD 4.5 stars, because I think it's almost perfect. Body groove is an amazing creative workout that leaves me feeling happy, fulfilled and worked. The playlists are great and offer fun, varied routines. My only complaint is that there is no way of connecting the songs in a playlist to the individual grooves, which makes it very difficult to make your own playlist or even to add a favorite to an existing workout. Overall, I really enjoy body groove, and I've been doing it almost every day, but for a workout so centered on doing what feels right for you, I wish the DVD was a little easier to customize.",1329696000,16,632,4.456896551724138

4464451,5,B004SS0TQ0,I'm very happy with this purchase.  It was easy to follow and as Misty says you can't get it wrong. You can make it easy or challenging depending on your fitness level. My first time around I planned to do one workout and wound up doing four. They were so much that they didn't feel like exercise. Misty is very easy to listen to as she leads you expertly through basic dance moves. If you like to  move to music you should buy this video.,1327190400,8,439,4.152941176470589
4464452,5,B004SS0TQ0,"This is the best dance workout dvd ever! It is broken into short 5 min segments or dances. Each one is to a different song and style. Each one is roughly 5 mins. There are 5-pre-set dance routines consisting of about 6-7 dance segments. You can also do each one a la carte! It is amazing. It is so modern, easy to follow, low impact and it gets your heartrate elevated! She shows you the basic movement and then you make it your own! The music is great. there is a ton of variety too. I have tried many dance workouts to before to be disappointed, frustrated or just did not like them. This is genius! Misty is amazing. She makes it fun, doable and you get a great workout too. SHe is so cool and laid-back, but gives great verbal suggestions. The set and the backgrounders are cool and modern and diverse. I am glad I got this one.",1327104000,33,832,4.20625
4464453,4,B004SS0TQ0,"There are 4 discs, 2 of them are dance videos. The dance videos are a lot of fun. As a runner, I don't think the intensity is very high at all, my heart rate might not be getting into the 60% zone. Also, I am a little uncomfortable with the parts that are too free form though. There is 1 section where you're supposed to move in slow motion for a couple of minutes and I never know what to do, so I just move around while standing on 1 leg. Another section I don't really like is that you move to a position every couple of seconds and hold it. I never know what to do there either... Fortunately for me, these sections are pretty short. One of the dance discs has a segment with an ab workout on it which I find very challenging.

There is also a yoga disc, and a pilates disc. I think it's the pilates disc which I thought was hard but I've only done each of these discs once. I just had knee surgery and I can't get on my knees right now but maybe I'll try them again in a month or 2.

Overall, I do like doing the dance discs much better than normal aerobics.",1326931200,17,1064,3.967289719626168

8440191,5,B004SS0TQ0,"Loved, loved, loved this workout, much to my surprise.
I have no rhythm, I have no soul, I have a vague sense of beat.
I bought this because I have friends who love Misty and recommended her.
The price was right so I gave it a try.  So glad I did.

I usually do step DVDs or other aerobic DVDs that have tightly choreographed moves.  With my lack of natural ability, this is what I need.  But with Body Groove, I just went with it.  While there is no formal choreography, Misty talks, in a calm, not annoying way, throughout, telling you what to do, but not necessarily how to do it.  For the first time ever, I was able to go with the flow because I was the flow.  In listening to Misty, in following her suggestions of movement, I would hit upon a position that felt right, or it caused a release of tension.  I could stay in that position, repeat that position until I was ready to move on, no pressure.

Each time I do these workouts (and there are quite a few), I feel like I have worked out, but I also feel stretched and mellow.",1348012800,21,1035,4.135
8440192,5,B004SS0TQ0,"So far, I have only tried Spirit Groove, but the directions are so clear I was able to chair dance with them. I am mobitily impaired, but Misty's focus on body movement made me really feel like I was dancing for the first time in years. I plan to try Latin Groove tonight.",1346371200,6,272,4.150943396226415

8440194,4,B004SS0TQ0,"If you don't like the same old stuff, this is a good workout for you.  It has a lot of just doing movement on your own, but I enjoyed her leading and the idea that I couldn't do it wrong.  I got a good workout and was a always a good cd to throw in to keep everything fresh.",1344297600,8,274,3.6271186440677967
