1857721,5,B00008OSD9,"Low-Budget movies seem to be coming out nonstop this year and here yet again is another one, but is Gacy as bad as it seems? Sure this movie has its flaws, but what movie doesn't?
Well lets start off with the plot. The story is the public and secret life of John Wayne Gacy...but it doesn't really cover much of the background of Gacy's childhood. It starts off with Gacy as a teenanger on a camping/fishing trip with his father, but then immediately it goes to Gacy's life when he was married for the 2nd time. We only see a part of Gacy's life before he was caught and exposed for what he had done.
The effects were okay, maybe the directing and lighting wasn't good for some, but I really didn't mind it. I usually never notice these kind of things anyways, I mostly watch for the acting.
Speaking of which, wasn't that great. I mean besides Mark Holton as Gacy himself, the other actors were horrible. Mark Holton was intense and gave great dedication to the character. I think he pulled it off quite well, and I notice that his acting was one of the best highlights of the movie everyone seems to agree on. It was different to see him play such a character, especially when you see him in movies like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Leprechaun.
Overall I liked 'Gacy' in a way. I wish the movie had covered more about his life, but what it did cover gave me more insight on the serial killer, John Wayne Gacy.
If you've seen this movie around, you should definately rent it first. I don't think it's for everyone, but if you have seen it and you enjoyed it, buy it for your collection.",1055203200,,1586,4.343434343434343
1857722,1,B00008OSD9,"Do these filmmakers want to make a movie about a real life serial killer or don't they? Why make a movie like GACY or DAHMER if you don't understand--or fear to really touch--the subject matter you're getting yourself involved with? This film was a tremendous disappointment for me because it bears little resemblance to the actual serial killer. You can tell that its creators didn't have their heart in it, so to speak. I think they were simply throwing something together solely for commercial gain, that's obvious. Commercial gain is fine but there must be a balance. What we see in GACY is a clumsy, sissified, and utterly moronic version of John Wayne Gacy. It seems in the movie that everyone Gacy comes across is harshly insulting him in some way or trying to beat him up! In reality, those may've been very small tidbits within the killer's life, but it wasn't the big picture. Anyone even peripherally aware of the case knows how respected Gacy was within his community. He was not an incompetent imbecile, as he was more or less portrayed in this film. He only PLAYED a clown, he wasn't ACTUALLY a clown! In my opinion, it's just obnoxious to see how this material was treated. An example of a fairly recent true-life serial killer movie that works (for me, at least), something with blood in its veins, is TED BUNDY. As for GACY, the makers missed their target by miles. Maybe someone else will get it right. Though, I won't be holding my breath.",1054944000,5,1458,4.655038759689923
1857723,2,B00008OSD9,"THIS MOVIE WAS AN EXTREME DISSAPOINTMENT.  AS A MAN HAVING SOME INTEREST IN THE MIND AND ACTIONS OF A SERIAL KILLER THIS TALE WAS LAME AT BEST.  WAS GACY REALLY THIS BIG OF A SISSY?  THIS MOVIE TOTALLY MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A FOOL.  THERE WAS NO DETAIL TO THIS MOVIE AT ALL.  IT SHOOTS A SCENE, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEONE IS DEAD.  IT NEVER SHOWS HOW THE PEOPLE DIE.  IT ALSO DOES NOT GO MORE INTO HIS CHILDHOOD.  SOME PRISON LIFE WOULD BE NICE TOO.  TO ME IT LOOKED LIKE A DOCUMENTRY ON BUGS AND WORMS.  THEY MUST HAVE SHOWED THEM 100 TIMES.  I DONT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL.  I SUGGEST YOU STICK TO MADE UP SERIAL KILLERS SUCH AS HANNIBLE LECTER.",1053734400,,650,4.071428571428571
1857724,2,B00008OSD9,"This movie is a virtual candyland of missed opportunities. first, like a lot of serial killer movies, it's structured almost as a series of episodic vignettes, which is okay, but here they don't flow together all that well (here's gacy digging in the crawlspace...now he's wrestling with young boys...now he's cruising the streets, etc). the filmmakers didn't seem to realize that there was an actual straightforward story here. second, and most heinous, is that a lot of what's presented is just flat-out WRONG! Whole chunks of the Gacy story are, for no good reason, left out--chunks that would've made the film much better, such as his back story, his civic & political activitism. the events leading to his arrest are wholly inaccurate, too. (and what was the deal with the two sleazy detectives, anyway? they look like they wandered onto the set from the David Lynch movie shooting on the next lot over.) in the end, Gacy drives away, the bodies are found, we see Gacy in jail, and...the movie ends!! no trial, no outraged neighbors, none of Gacy's bogus ""Jack Handley"" defense, no gas chamber, nada. In short, they cut out anything that might have made this a dramatically compelling film. A much MUCH better movie about the Gacy case is TO CATCH A KILLER, with Brian Dennehy playing Gacy.
The only reason to see this movie is the amazing performance by Mark Holton as Gacy. i was skeptical going in; I figured I'd be thinking of him as francis from Pee-wee's Big Adventure the whole time, but he actually does a stunning job. why isn't this guy working more anyway?",1053648000,14,1572,4.783088235294118
1857725,3,B00008OSD9,"Problems: It left out a lot of the story, which most of these serial killer movies seem to do. It fast forwards through his childhood. other left out facts: does not mention that specialists believe Gacy's abnormal behavior was from blood clot in the brain cause by a childhood swing accident. It also doesn't mention him trying to build a pool, that is where the bodies where stored. Doesn't mention him attacking men at job interviews, and at least 3 court actions brought against him before he was caught. Finally, it doesn't mention his time spent on death row: He would paint clowns, and portraits of Jeffrey Dahmer from what I understand. Other than all these facts left out, I thought this movie could have been more twisted if they had added more blood, or actually showed more of the torture he did. Don't get me wrong, there was torture scenes, but there was a lot of ""you fill in the blanks"" too. The Ted Bundy movie was better",1052870400,,938,4.556213017751479
1857726,1,B00008OSD9,"I just got through watching this film, and i must say it was horribly done. I read several reports, and even wrote my own report about the serial clown killer John Wayne Gacy, and I'm wondering if the director did any research on him what so ever. Most of the events in this film was incorrect not to mention they made him look like a total idiot when it came to his own contracting business and especially how people felt about him. Now from all the research that i have done about Gacy, he was a successful business man and most people in town loved him but in this film they make him look like a crook and a person that wasn't liked. I expected this film to have been a lot better... it reminded me about the movie ALI, which was also horribly done. The movie was incorrect, boring and the acting was just sickening. I do not admire Gacy infact i think he was a sick, demented person but all i asked for was a film that was well done. When i picked this film up i did not expect it to be a ""Award winning film"" or even as good as the movie FROM HELL (Jack The Ripper), and i knew it was going to be a low budget film, but was there any money invested in it or what? GACY should never have been released. So SORRY to disappoint the people who are fans of serial killing films or thrillers but i suggest this film should stay on the shelf, but if you have nothing else to do and you are bored, go head and pick this film up... it's worth a watcher for movie freaks.",1052784000,2,1466,4.058620689655172

1857797,3,B00008OSD9,"These serial killer films are really hit or miss, most of them are misses, for a variety of reasons. They are usually cheaply made, direct-to-video films, with an inexperienced cast, trying to profiteer on the infamy of these evil men. That being said, I decided to watch Gacy anyway, because of all the insane people who became infamous, John Wayne Gacy, may have been the craziest. This married man with kids, ran a construction business, that only employed young boys, and on the weekends, he made extra money by dressing up as a clown for children's birthday parties. This man was seen as a wimpy, harmless, closeted guy, no one would have ever thought they'd find 27 bodies underneath his house. The producers of the film, Gacy, decided to take it in a different direction than similar films by introducing Gacy as this loveable loser. If you didn't know the story and just popped in the film for the hell of it, I'd have thought this was some kind of comedy....until it wasn't. Veteran character actor, Mark Holton, stars as Gacy and was terrific, he was honestly the only reason to watch the film, especially after it turned. The story is horrific and the rest of the cast amounts to little more than eye candy, but Holton really pulls everything together, takes you inside Gacy's tortured mind, and makes this movie more than just another slasher film. After watching Gacy, I did what everyone else would do and Wiki'ed John Wayne Gacy. I wasn't surprised to see that the film is considered to be wildly inaccurate. Obviously five people aren't going to live in a house with 27 rotting bodies underneath and be almost completely oblivious to it, so I knew the film probably had a lot of bull @#$% in it. The film does have a talented star that really makes this film much more interesting then the other serial killer bio-pics.",1382227200,2,1835,4.684210526315789
1857798,1,B00008OSD9,"Don't waste your time, or money, on this movie. It was awful. The acting wasn't very good and it didn't really cover anything to do with Gacy's personal life or upbringing. If you want to watch a GOOD movie about Gacy try 'To Catch a Killer'.",1382227200,,242,4.282608695652174
1857799,3,B00008OSD9,Based on the real-life mass murderer--It's hard to fathom that this guy could have fooled all his family and friends/neighbors for so long and be this twisted up inside.

1857800,3,B00008OSD9,"Gacy was an intriguing, torn individual.  A poor devil toiling mightily to resolve antagoning internal warfare.  His story is tragic, but misses dramatic tragedy, because it is disgusting, shameful and caused so much terror, humiliation and agony.  It's difficult, if not impossible, to make theater out of the slaughter of innocents.  Mark Holton gave a compelling performance in making a human being out of this miserable specimen.  He deserves a good four stars.",1379116800,,465,5.315068493150685
1857801,2,B00008OSD9,"I was born in Iowa in the early 60s, within an hour drive or so of where John Wayne Gacy was a manager of three Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.  Since I lived in Iowa until my mid-teens, I believe that I'm qualified to make the following assertion:  In Iowa, Mr. Gacy surely never fit in.

He was surely a psychopath, no doubt about that.  He liked to kill kids -- and perhaps even do worse than that, if that is possible -- and then bury them in his crawlspace.  He liked to dress up as a clown, but in reality, perhaps that was when he was showing his true self.  But perhaps his biggest weakness:  when it comes to a murderer, he just wasn't what I'd call a ""sexy"" serial killer.  Hey, women were fighting each other at the courthouse to get close enough to become the wife of Richard Ramirez, however sick and twisted that might be.  And even one was the ""winner.""  A woman wanted to be married to Ted Bundy so badly that she hung out in a courtroom day after day to have her chance at that ""charmer.""  Gacy?  He was already married, but more than likely, his wife wanted out of that deal.

And this is surely not what I would call a ""sexy"" film.  I've tried to watch it a couple of times, and just gave up in the beginning of the second act both times.  I just think that the acting's not all that great, the production values aren't that great, the direction is off, and the screenplay surely could have been better.

Supposedly, Mr. Gacy was not a cannibal, and that's one of the only good things that I can say about him really.  But that didn't mean that he was a vegetarian; after all, he seemed to like eating chicken.  And as any good Iowan knows, ""Beef; it's what's for dinner.""  Perhaps Mr. Gacy would have fit in better in Iowa if he worked at Sizzler instead.",1372291200,,1779,4.241071428571429
1857802,2,B00008OSD9,"The title selected for this review reflects both the movie and Gacy's crawlspace. Many have given kudos to the actor playing Gacy and they are deserved. As for the rest of the film: 1)It starts off with what is almost a mere cameo appearance by Adam Baldwin as Gacy's father who suddenly and jarringly abuses his youthful son both physically and emotionally while on a fishing trip. The reason for this behavior is never revealed. And how did the producers of this film know what took place during that camping incident? There were no witnesses. 2)Fast forward from 1953 to 1976 and we are immediately made aware of the crawling life forms that inhabit Gacy's crawlspace with absolutely no story lead in. (Indeed, there is a fixation on the part of the filmmakers to dwell on the creepy crawlers which makes it even more ridiculous that no one wonders more about this aberrant situation.) Something should have been inserted in the storyline beforehand to give at least a hint of Gacy's motivation. All those who have been physically and emotionally abused by a parent, relative, or stranger don't necessarily turn into mass murderers of young men.

As noted by other reviewers, as depicted here, the unabashed stupidity and ignorance on the part of those who work with Gacy or have contact with him as neighbors as to what may be going on is astounding. Certainly a red flag should have gone up when an exterminator who was brought in to clean up the crawlspace was almost overwhelmed by the sight and smell of his encounter. Policemen, who should have recognized the smell of death, were oblivious to what their noses told them. Strange black ooze that suddenly appeared coming up on a neighbor's lawn was not oil. And wouldn't that ooze have demanded attention to make sure that it wasn't toxic? When Gacy nearly bludgeoned to death one of his workers who stopped him in mid-air from delivering the final fatal blow, the guy accepts an apology and continues working for Gacy. Incredible! Did these young men have a lobotomy prior to being hired?

That Gacy's wife was so out of it is also bewildering. That neither she nor her two daughters ever saw anything suspicious is more than a puzzlement. Were they all in denial? You cannot pick up 2000 boys (according to the film), kill at least 29+ and not leave some sort of trail. Yet, Gacy quite obviously did succeed in fooling people. And, as stated by others, this movie gives more insight into those who surrounded Gacy than Gacy himself.

Overall, the movie has a disjointed quality, is poorly edited, and has sudden shifts that make one scratch one's head. The two detectives who show up at the end to follow Gacy look more like sloppy bounty hunters and give the impression that they never did put 2 and 2 together. Even their appearance in the first place is somewhat iffy. Gacy's ""boarder"", played by a young Charlie Weber, dumps his girlfriend without telling the audience why and we are left to surmise that she told ""Tom"" about Gacy's advances and he didn't believe her. Yet, Tom must have had some inkling of what Gacy was all about since he was living in the house for awhile and the rooms weren't exactly sound proof. And no one ever paid attention to any screams or the sight of a young man being dragged into Gacy's garage. A sexual move on Gacy's part towards Tom was explained as a ""trust test"" and the young man bought it. He was even stupid enough to let Gacy put handcuffs on him as part of a dare which nearly cost him his life.

What all this adds up to is a movie that takes on a generic horror veneer that could have been made without any reference to John Wayne Gacy at all. Only the performance by the titular actor saved it from getting a single star from me. See Friday the 13th of any number and it will make more sense than GACY. The former will also be scarier and better done. Don't buy this turkey which takes advantage of a real life horrific situation and turns it into cinema fluff. It has absolutely no socially redeeming qualities unless one wants to believe that, starting in the 1970s at the latest, we are witnessing the total dumbing down of America and the rise of unspeakable soulless murder.",1371513600,3,4189,4.603748326639893

Anyways-this gives you an idea that he was a sicko but this movie is loosely based on his life because there is no record of the storyline (especially at the end) ever happening.  Yes he lured, tortured, raped, and killed young men, burying them in his crawl space which the movie covers but the rest just seems like filler.  Ironically, the makers of this film added the false storyline when Gacy's story didn't need filler if they just took the time to tell it accurately.  You won't learn much more about John Wayne Gacy from this film than what the two sentences of the synopsis you don't already tell you but it is a decent movie.  It definitely has the creep factor going for it and that is partially because this guy was real and you already know the fate of these poor kids.

1857822,3,B00008OSD9,"Typecasting can be fatal to an actor's career, as Mark Holton will forever be known as ""Francis Buxton"" from ""Pee Wee's big Adventure."" But in ""Gacy,"" he does step out of that, and he does a decent job at it.

John W. Gacy was a horrible man, raised in a harsh environment by an abusive father. People have tried to blame Gacy's behavior on a head injury but the post-mortem didn't show anything. It could be any number of things, but 29 boys and young men didn't bury themselves in the crawlspace under his house. In the end, police connected him to 33 murders (and there could have been even more), which earned him the death penalty.

In this film, the viewer gets a glimpse of how it was when he was a boy; his relationship(ha)with his father, which really did inflict some psychological scars on him. It then goes into a narration which tells of his prison term, his early release, and his attempt to rebuild his life. No mention of his first marriage or the family which broke up due to his crime, or why he got into being a clown for kids' parties.

There are a lot of frustrating leaps in the storyline, jumping from scene to scene, often with no build-up or release; just a series of seemingly disconected exposition, but one does get a pretty good idea that something is wrong with this situation. Why is there such a foul odor coming from this guy's house? Yes, we see some nasty looking sludge being sump-pumped out of his house, and the neighbors are having a problem with the resultant biohazard which is developing, and his second wife makes a discovery no wife wants to make (""What have I married"" reaction).

Understandably, no normal-length film can tell the entire story, there will be omissions, but so much of the Gacy story is left to the imagination, which usually only works in fiction. This is told as a true story, but the writers took many liberties to tell this story, which isn't completely true, as told here. Although the general idea is there.

As far as movies go, ""Gacy"" isn't necessarily a bad film. It informs those who don't know of him, and frustrates those who know the story.

P.S.

Read the other reviews of this movie, positive and negative. They all have Gacy's name appended to the word ahead of it. There is no space between any word which preceeds Gacy's name and the name itself. I wonder why this is so?",1299888000,2,2351,4.504694835680751

Then it fast fowards to a dinner table where his family consisting of his wife, mother, and two daughters and himself are eating dinner. Right there its like the studio wanted to make a short movie so they took out alot of not important stuff and just go fast forward to where he starts his construction company recruiting young teenage boys to work for him. The film makes you cheer for Gacy as he comes off as a model citizen of his community and has done alot for his community. No one suspects Gacy is hiding bodies of boys in his basement which gives off a rotting smell until the police get involved and start questioning him. The film is indeed rated R it has alot of cussing, nudity, violence, blood but doesn't really show what Gacy did to his victims. It does show a scene where he takes his victim and drowns them to death in his bathtub and another one where he hits the boy in the head with a hammer and tells him not to tell on him. The acting is pretty good but the script is just so out of place its like the studio didn't plan on doing a good job of having what year these events took place. The only year it gives is in the beginning which is in the mid 1950's the rest it just jumps into the movie full force. Also is gives no reason why Gacy begin to like boys or why he did the things he did. Maybe its because he wanted a son? Its a good rental but as for buying it I wouldn't as its too short and ends off which Gacy fleeing from the police. It could of actually showed him in jail getting the injection which kills him. Or at least his wife and family members in shock or at the trial.",1266969600,,1880,4.139344262295082
1857826,5,B00008OSD9,"Gacy was a disturbing movie to watch.  It's about a guy who does the worst things imaginable to teenage boys.  Eventually the bugs and the smell get so bad... yeah it's the kind of storyline that will make you think... and make you sick.

The movie moves along at a pace that's almost too realistic.  The guy going around doing horrible things to boys has serious problems in his head because of his father beating and sexually abusing him as a child.

Eventually the cops get suspicious, soon after his wife finds out about her husbands sexual preferences by way of magazines he has hidden away (but that's all- she did NOT know about the other bad things he was doing at the time).

The guy has serious mental problems too- people would call him names and he would totally flip out with unbelievable rage.  It was incredibly disturbing how many murders he was getting away with.  It seemed whenever he was committing a murder nobody would be around to catch him in the act.

The movie seems to focus on the roaches and worms crawling around the dead bodies.  Why I don't know.  Unless the movie directors wanted to focus on how disgusting it is when dead bodies are rotting away.  The bodies were stored in his basement.

It was interesting how the guys neighbors, the cops, and other people all noticed an extremely bad smell but didn't realize what was causing it or where it was coming from.  Also interesting is that the guys wife and mother didn't even notice any smell.  Perhaps the writers forgot to include them in the nose-grabbing stink scenes!

I thought the movie was easy to understand, not really confusing, and the story rolled along at a comfortable and understandable pace.",1250380800,3,1692,4.62751677852349

I wish the story was more from point A to point B, showing more of a kill by kill storytelling. Instead it was more of a big picture, everything happening all at once, and showing his relationship with neighbors and ppl in his city. But the thing that makes this movie awesome is Mark Holton as Gacy, he is outstanding. He plays such a smart and outgoing person, unlike the normal profile of sick killers being quiet and reserved, and then he flips over an is one of the creepiest and evil characters i've seen. He did such a good job i gave the movie 4 stars for that reason alone, overall the layout of the movie wasn't what i was hoping for.

The movie is choppy, incoherent, and unintentionally funny at times.  Who were the creepy detectives sitting in Gacy's lawn in lawn chairs?  As the detectives close in, Gacy drives off in a huff and the movie ends...huh?  Did the moviemakers run out of money?  It would seem the trial, imprisonment and execution would be far more interesting, and the movie doesn't touch this area, except for a nasty dying quote from Gacy just before the closing credits.  There is no real concept of time with this movie - -very choppily edited.  Just a horrible production.

But, again, Holton seems to at least convey the essence of this psycho...Would like to see Holton play Gacy post-arrest, with a more able writing and directing team.",1231632000,,973,4.884146341463414

The film succeeded in scaring me,and I was tense most of the film. In that, I commend writer/director Clive Saunders for making my $2.00 investment worthwhile.

1857846,3,B00008OSD9,"Friend,Neighbor,Killer...... John Wayne Gacy was all 3. Although not a true serial killer movie, the movie was pretty good. If you are a slasher movie fan, this movie is not for you for there is no gore and no bloody killing scenes. The movie starts off showing Gacy as a young boy on a hunting trip in the woods with his father. We see that his father would taunt him with insults and put downs. We then see Gacy as an adult who is married living what seemed to be a normal life. Gacy's mother lived with them also. To everyone who knew him, Gacy seemed the model citizen. He would throw parties and volunteered as a clown at the hospital. What everyone didn't know is that Gacy was a cold blooded murderer killing many young men. Neighbors start complaining about the awful odor coming from Gacy's basement. Gacy always passed this off as having had a sewer pipe broken. In actuality, the stench was coming from numerous bodies Gacy had buried in the crawlspace underneath his home. When the complaints got so bad, Gacy started using lime to cover up the smell. Gacy would sometimes pose as a police officer in order to lure young boys into his vehicle. He had his own construction type company and employed young men. When Gacy's wife finds sex toys he had hidden, she confronts him and he denies all but she is not convinced and leaves him. The killings go on as Gacy rides around and finds more victims. All of whom end up buried in the crawlspace of his home. Gacy kills so many young men, that he actually runs out of burial room. After an employee reports him to the police, they stake out his home which Gacy actually seemed to enjoy. Gacy would taunt the police and enjoyed playing a cat and mouse game with them. Eventually, he is caught and when local authorities visit the crawlspace to his home, they find Gacy's own gruesome ""cemetery"" crawling with maggots and roaches. It is then discovered that almost 30 bodies are buried there. Chicago was shocked to find out that they had such a serial killer living there like an ordinary citizen. This movie is interesting because it does give us a glimpse into the sick mind of Gacy. However it does so without horror and gore. I'd recommend renting this movie. I purchased it and don't regret it.",1140825600,,2255,4.515892420537897
1857857,3,B00008OSD9,"Mark Holton was fine in the part, and really seemed to be inhabiting the house where Gacy lived.  He makes your skin creep seeing him with his nasty ways and his contempt for everyone else.  Was the mother ever implicated in any of the murders?  How could she have avoided knowing what was going on?  In the movie you see her sleeping in her chair with the TV Guide open in her lap.  It's almost as though she never wakes up.  Is the mother still alive?  Maybe someone could ask her what she thinks of her portrayal in this movie.

The film is lousy with cliches, and the actors who play the different victims are soap opera-bad.  They're not even soft porn bad, they're soap opera bad.  The one who plays ""Tom,"" Gacy's foreman, is better than most of them, but he (Charlie Weber) is still perfecting his craft.

That clown makeup is a doozy, isn't it.  They probably spent more money on making Holton look like a demented clown than they spent in all the other details of the movie, including the script.

I felt sorry for the boys who had to plunge their hands into the maggots.  Hope they got combat pay for that one.  Otherwise I kept watching, wondering how Gacy was going to get caught.  Why did he ever let Roger go?  That was his downfall, wasn't it?  Or was it just annoying the cops who were after him?  You rile a cop long enough, he's going to bust you for something.  It was like a fantastic double bluff on Gacy's part, just daring the detectives, who were by then camped out in his front yard, to catch him with something.

Didn't Gacy live in Chicago?  And yet they filmed the whole movie in Reseda or somewhere like that.  Totally bogus.",1134604800,2,1654,4.350819672131148

In all the reading/watching about serial killers it always has me paranoid about the ""nice- happy happy joy joy people"" cause I don't feel that is the ""norm"" for better lack of a word. I'm wondering what was practice for Mark or what he did to get ready for the role? He was so believable.

That being said, the portrayal of Gacy by Mark Houlton was really good.  He looks like him physically and pulls off friendly, yet scary appearance very well.  He makes this movie worth watching.

I think he did a great job portraying Gacy. Nobody can fully understand what goes on inside a serial killer's mind so it doesn't try anything in depth in terms of psychological makeup, but attempts to make insights. In the beginning we see Gacy's father as abusive, trying to make his son macho. Perhaps Gacy was not raised in an environment of love, so such human qualities as compassion were not there. He puts on a good front as a cover as being ""Mr. Nice Guy"" in his community. With so many bodies buried in his property there was some serious stinking going on yet the real life Gacy he had dozens buried in there and still nobody knew.

His neighborhood did not have bright people living there apparently.

I thought the movie was done well. I enjoyed it. It makes you think of all the prostitutes out there they can indeed become prime targets for the loonies and sickos out there. How many people out there got killed and nobody knew because they had no family or anybody who cared about them. Scary thought. It makes you wonder...

I had no idea Gacy's last words were ""Kiss my ass"" just before lethal injection, and that he picked up approximately 2,000 men.

It was as if the producers said, ""We are going to make a series of films about America's most horrific serial killers, despite the fact that we have limited resources and an astonishing lack of understanding about good and evil.  We will bring nothing to these stories.""

I could have at least understood the slimiest stereotype of a Hollywood bottom-dwelling producer making a grotesque exploitation picture of any of these maniacs, but why take the high road (meaning, ""dull and ponderous"") if you have ZERO insight into these crimes?

But that concept has been so played in films about serial killers.  In fact, it's been played twice--quite adequately, in fact--with respect to Gacy himself.

I think this film attempts to do the reverse.  To look at how the community reacts while all these murders are going on right on their doorstep.  This movie is different.  It's a parody, complete with almost ""Texas-Chainsaw"" gore for effect, to show how Gacy was able, for years, to rape and kill marginalized young men right under the noses of his ""unsuspecting"" neighbors.  It also has a darkly comic undertone to it.  Just watch this movie and think about how many people come and go from his house and how many people complain of the smell, all the while, 29 bodies rotting in the basement.

there was no music in the first 20 minutes or so and then all of a sudden the movie attempted being scary and added traditional and bad scary movie-type music. when that didn't work out, it went back to its more documentary style. then of course back to scary movie and that failing once again, it moved on to amateur at best use of after effects (i know i could have done that better and i usually use imovie).

  A lot of reviewers were not pleased with the movie, but I must say that it was entertaining.  Although this is not the movie you go out and buy, it is one worth renting.",1060387200,,359,4.173913043478261
1857895,4,B00008OSD9,"I thought I was horrified by what John Wayne Gacy did before I saw this movie.  But now, I am TRUELY HORRIFIED by what this man did (And how he behaved while he was doing it)!  This film is not suitable for children. My only complaint is that they didn't show Gacy playing ""Pogo The Clown.""  Had they shown Gacy (As Pogo) trying to make children smile, an attempted murder scene towards the end would have been more horrifying still.",1060128000,,433,4.3875

This movie is barley watchable and so inaccurate that your better off watching a crummy YouTube re-enactment.

Some interesting moments and a decent performance from Mark Holton as Gacy, but still didn't hit the persona on the head. It may be much better to read the book, Killer Clown, instead.",1511913600,,344,4.655737704918033
7986292,1,B00008OSD9,"I think I didn't like it because I like the view of the INVESTIGATORS better.  But, saying that, the Brian Dennehy version of Gacy years ago, he conveyed a chilling, cold evil without the excessive odd Gacy histrionics this movie did.  we don't want to sympathize with Gacy, but in this move, we had no one to relate with, because there wasn't enough of the 'good guy' screen time to counter Gacy's character's screen time.  Would I ever watch it again, no.  Do I think about it?  Only when I see the movie promo photo, and then I just think how much I was disappointed, and can't figure out what the writer's could have done to make it better because of the first version of this move with Brian Dennehy.  Thing is, this portrayal of Gacy was rather disgusting.  He was portrayed in this movie as a slovenly, inept pig.  If he was so inept, how'd he get away with killing so many people.  The first version was much better.  Much, much better.",1492560000,,944,4.404624277456647

This movie is almost surreal in the contrast between day to day stuff-even Gacy had to make a living-and  scenes that are short enough to horrify you and still provide an accurate account. Pretty good acting for the most part.,1468627200,2,262,4.822222222222222
