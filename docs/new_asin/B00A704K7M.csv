5391908,3,B00A704K7M,"Its not a bad movie but its not exactly awesome either. I agree the lead female's voice is obnoxious. I actually think they wanted her to act like another particular actress that can pull it off a little better. The voice and mannerisms reminded me of Kim Sun Ah however while she can pull off the voice and the slightly immature mannerisms it comes off with humor where as this came off as annoying, but i won't blame the actress i've never seen her in anything else. I have to say though the best part of this entire movie is her friend in the last ten minutes. That ladies laugh made it worth watching.",1409097600,,605,4.315789473684211
5391909,3,B00A704K7M,"I am going to continue watching this movie because I enjoy the lead actor, however I find the lead actresses acting to be Way over the top and the voice she is using is annoying.  There have been times in the movie so far that she lapses into a normal sounding voice.  The story line has a lot of promise but this actress has chosen to portray her character as an non-professional  journalist who baby talks her way through this movie.  To Bad!  I will give it a three for the script and the blessing of the other actors.",1403395200,,521,4.222222222222222
5391910,2,B00A704K7M,"I really wanted to watch and like this movie because the plot synopsis sounded right up my alley.  Unfortunately, the way the female lead acted (a grown woman using an exaggerated 12 year old girly voice and mannerisms), drove me nuts.  I just couldn't finish it.",1399161600,2,263,4.695652173913044
5391911,5,B00A704K7M,"No offense to Asian culture but sometimes I have a hard time connecting to their cinema but I'm finding I absolutely love Korean movies! Thank you Hulu for introducing me to them! This is a cute movie with a decent (sometimes rather predictable story line) but I loved it. It made me laugh which for me is what counts in movies usually. The English subtitles are not perfect but that could be because I'm an English Teacher so I'm a little picky about grammar but you can definitely follow what they're saying and improvise it in your mind. Just as a note, the main actress' voice is supposed to be high pitched and kind of annoying but she gives a comic performance. Overall a great movie, hence why I bought it on amazon :)",1388534400,2,725,4.417910447761194
5391912,5,B00A704K7M,"This the hardest movie to find over 1 years time looking for it
So happy I finally got it so happy",1360454400,,98,3.7142857142857144
5391913,2,B00A704K7M,"Meh...definitely not one of your better Korean movies despite the famous cast.  There have been plenty of female leads with high pitched voices (usually used when they are playing their younger versions).  This character continued with the extremely irritating, childish voice all the way through. OK script except for her.  Agree with commenters below, subbing HORRIBLE!",1459728000,,371,5.589285714285714
5391914,5,B00A704K7M,The Perfect Couple is hilarious and the cast is terrific!  I've watched it several times just to get in a better mood and it works every time!,1459209600,,142,4.2592592592592595
5391915,4,B00A704K7M,"Super cute and fun romantic comedy.  Actors were all quite likable and entertaining.  The subtitles were poor though-- lots of grammatical problems and mistranslated phrases.  The mediocre translation wasn't difficult to understand, just annoying.
Would give 5/5 if not for the poor subtitle work.",1454025600,,297,5.704545454545454
5391916,2,B00A704K7M,"Started watching because of lee dong wool. But, the female leads character was just too annoying, high screechy voice. I've seen lee dong wool in  the drama "". Scent of a women"" excellent drama",1443139200,,193,4.676470588235294
5391917,5,B00A704K7M,I really enjoyed that drama alot,1439856000,,32,4.5
5391918,2,B00A704K7M,"Lee Dong Wook is fine as all outdoors... but this movie is terrible. I'm not really sure what the plot is because my eyes kept glazing over. The lead actress' voice is so grating and cartoonish, good luck getting through the entire film. But like I said, Lee Dong Wook is a beautiful man... so, maybe mute it and just stare at him? Or better yet watch him in one of his dramas like Scent of a Woman.",1434844800,,399,4.128205128205129
5391919,5,B00A704K7M,"Good, laugh out loud comedy but be warned; the English subtitles are horridly incorrect.",1433721600,2,88,5.357142857142857

5391922,2,B00A704K7M,"This is some of the worst subtitling I have come across in a Korean production. I really wanted to watch this, but I had to keep stopping it to figure out what they were talking about because the English didn't make a lot of sense. One of the most interesting, and puzzling translations that comes up in the beginning is that the main character has a ""peaks phobia"". I paused it to try and figure out what in the world that could mean - but had to wait until it was eventually explained in the film that the guy is afraid of sharp objects (forks, pencils, knives, etc). Looks like a pretty funny movie. Maybe I'll try it again another day when I have more patience.",1411948800,,665,4.285714285714286
8547676,1,B00A704K7M,Difficult to watch when you hear the main actress' HIGH SQUEAKY NASAL VOICE!! Very annoying & disappointing!!,1518307200,,109,5.470588235294118

8547680,4,B00A704K7M,"This is a really funny movie. Almost every scene is funny. The dialog is funny, the acting is funny and even the plot develops in ironic twists and turns. More than chemistry, Hyun Young and Lee Dong Wook have timing. The movie starts out with a flashback for each of the characters that illuminates their personalities and provides foreshadowing for action later in the film. Choi Soo Jin, a reporter at a paparazzi type newspaper, and  Kang Jae Hyuk, a policeman with a career threatening phobia, first meet when she accidentally stabs him with a tempura skewer while he is chasing a crook. Thereafter they keep running into one another as happens in romantic comedies in encounters  that begin with them feeling mutual contempt but which gradually morph into love. They are finally assigned to work together to make a reality TV show about police work in the city. There are some very funny scenes of Soo Jin making Jae Hyuk (and his partner) run up a steep hill over and over while she films and directs them to make the opening credits for their TV show. And there is the big finale with a confrontation with the gangsters, bags of cocaine, lots of one against dozens martial art fights not to mention Molotov Cocktails culminating with a rooftop chase and a hug and a kiss for our stars (Awwww). I like this movie.  It keeps marching along and never drags.

Many of the reviewers take issue with Hyun Young's voice apparently forgetting that is an often repeated comic motif in the plot.  While I would agree that this is a matter of taste, still she has been around for quite a while, has very impressive credentials that include dozens of movies and dramas and, although it is a bit exaggerated for this role, her voice is something of a comic signature. For those who haven't watched the movie yet maybe the taste of the Korean media world ought to be weighed along side the negative reviews of individual commentators.",1477526400,,1928,4.658823529411765

8547683,3,B00A704K7M,I'm a big fan of Wookie so I watched it just to watch him in his earlier work. It was okay. Not much character development. Subtle love story.,1465084800,,142,4.107142857142857
