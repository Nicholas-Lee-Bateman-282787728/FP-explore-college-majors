8028047,4,B0002HODSQ,"Enjoyable B grade Foreign Legion film.  The plot is predictable, but still great fun.  One thing that Old Hollywood did that surprised me--they got so many elements of material culture correct.  Uniforms, gear and weapons look to be actual French military surplus.  Many might not care, but it makes a difference to me.",1504569600,,319,4.962264150943396

8028049,3,B0002HODSQ,"Rated ""CLASSIC.""  Well demonstrates the social setting at the time of film's making. Example: the pharse--""STOUT FELLOW"" as used for (A GOOD SPORT)...or a good person.  All effects, uniforms, metals, weapons and such are classic French Foreign Legion. And  settings , events , histortical correctness in materials, are excellent. A quite bit too slow in action for the young. Does sag in interest at several spots, which may be o.k. the first time you watch it, but not the second.",1339200000,4,481,4.9875
