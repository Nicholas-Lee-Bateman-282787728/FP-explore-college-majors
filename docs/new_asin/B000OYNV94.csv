8195783,5,B000OYNV94,I got this video to show my Geography class students and we all loved it! It was a wonderful overview of Jamaica and we loved that Peter Greenberg was willing to do all kinds of different activities. By the end of the DVD we all wanted to go to Jamaica.,1445558400,2,253,4.08

It made me feel all of the emotions of being in a beautiful, friendly, hospitable environment.  ""Once you have had a taste of Jamaica it never leaves you"".  If you want to know how it would feel to be in Jamaica, this is an excellent tool.  I was really surprised at the open, honest, view of the real Jamaica.  I did actually think it would be a more political view with some propaganda thrown in.  Not at all!  It truly reflected the real Jamaica.  The Prime Minister loves his country and it showed.  The love and pride was reflected in this documentary.  It is worth buying if you are thinking about a trip to Jamaica, or if you have been there, it brings back a lot of good memories and feelings.  If you watch Travel Channel, I also recommend Anthony Bourdain's Jamaica.  Another excellent documentary on the real Jamaica.  If you are thinking about making a trip to Jamaica and are not sure, GO!  It is a wonderful country full of wonderful people and adventures.  But, if you can't afford all of the touristy places, it is a beautiful spot to just chill and enjoy the beautiful surroundings and the perfect water.  Go and enjoy!",1278633600,3,1300,4.413502109704641
