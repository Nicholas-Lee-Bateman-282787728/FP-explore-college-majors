8324620,5,6305237204,"I would never have believed that I could lower my scores that dramatically.  I started this year (1998) with a 22.5 index handicap. I recieved the video as a gift in June.  In early August I was playing with  friends that could not believe that i was shooting par after 5 holes and 1  under after 6.  Then the jinx occurred but still had the best round of my  life (79).  The exercises are simple and I do them through out the day in  my office.  I do the full exercises 3 times per week.  I do not play  everyday but, the time I do play now is much more enjoyable.  No more  stiffness or falling apart on back 9.  I have also been hitting ball  straighter and longer, which leads to shooting at pars and bogeys instead  of scrambling for doubles and triples.",915062400,4,759,4.166666666666667
