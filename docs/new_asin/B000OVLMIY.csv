8186955,1,B000OVLMIY,"I bought this since my Christian name is Ignatius. But when I played it, it was in Spanish, no subtitles, spend hours just to get english out , I do not speak Spanish since I am Chinese american. Wasted time and at the end i gave it to my garder who speaks spanish.  Amazon should not sell product with foreign languages (Spanish, russian, swahili) etc without ANY translation, after all we are in the USA. Wasted my money on this one.",1283472000,7,435,4.37037037037037
8186956,3,B000OVLMIY,"No subtitles! in Spanish (made in Spain not South of the border).  Thank goodness I speak the language but my kids/hubby do not!! oops.  We were surprised :)

Yet, they asked me to translate.  OLD style movie... Like in the times of Greta Garbo.

Enjoyed it.  My kids loved the costumes used + horses! Plus they got to learn about another saint.",1280102400,,345,4.483870967741935
8186957,5,B000OVLMIY,"Well made movie of the life of this great saint.  It's great that they still sell movies about saints, too bad they don't make them anymore.  It's inspiring because it shows the conversion of a military man and how he became the founder of a religious order.  Good movie, if you don't mind reading the sub-titles.  Enjoy!",1272240000,16,321,4.578947368421052
