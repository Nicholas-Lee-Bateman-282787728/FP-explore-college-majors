The dancers are very good and explain the moves well, but the intro needs to be skipped.  I recommend Leigh Ann's Pole Dance Series instead-it is well worth the few extra bucks.",1301011200,2,334,4.724137931034483
8324434,5,0615212050,From the start I was hooked. This sexy style of pole dancing is the style I love to watch and would love to learn how to do.  I loved the beginning where the film compared the similarities to exotic dance and pole dancing. Then I was taken into a sensual warm up that put my body and mind in the mood to dance. The words that spoken were so beautiful and really helped me understand the art of pole dancing. All the dancers were amazing as they taught you how to be sexy while learning advanced pole moves and dances. I love this film!!!,1229904000,3,537,4.163461538461538
8324435,5,0615212050,"Thank you Sedusa for this DVD. I am an exotic dancer and besides teaching me new twirls, I even have learned your dances as a whole and incorporated them into my stage shows. I also loved the wordage in the film. It talks about the artistry of Pole Dancing. How you tell a beautiful story while dancing, by the way you move your body, because you have to forgo the use of words.. I am an entertainer and you made me feel the beauty in my dance. I hope more exotic dancer buy this  to learn what I learned.",1222214400,3,505,4.101010101010101
