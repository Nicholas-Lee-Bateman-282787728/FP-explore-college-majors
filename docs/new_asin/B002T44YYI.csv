8379790,5,B002T44YYI,This is a great video that covers the basics of realistic drawing. The materials presented are fundamental and really important to learn well. People sometimes jump the gun and learn the advanced without having mastered the basics. Heavily recommended for beginners who are trying to learn how to drawing.,1433980800,,305,5.244897959183674
8379791,1,B002T44YYI,"Poor quality. The music is too dramatic for the low budget self made video.  Seems he is a talented artist, but not a talented videographer",1326240000,,139,4.56
8379792,1,B002T44YYI,"I have several art lessons on DVD - from acrylic painting, stamping, drawing, silk painting, Chinese calligraphy, and watercolor lessons to photography lessons.  This is probably the worse teaching DVD I have ever seen.  There is no main menu.  You have to skip forward or back.  The camera does not focus on the work at all times.  Sometimes completely blurry as you wait for the person to refocus.  The instructor very rarely speaks.  He just points and holds things up that are not really focused or lacking enough light. He holds up pencils that are not in focus so it is hard to read which one he is using.  He has typed text on a piece of paper but it is not easy to read. I really tried my best to be patient and wait for it to improve but half way through I finally gave up - it never improved.  When I tried to go back to the main menu I was not able to find a main menu so had to skip forward or back when searching.  the main question is can you learn from this DVD?  In my opinion you will not be given the genuine basics of drawing in a professional manner.  It is not worth whatever they charge.
I am now trying out a new drawing lesson DVD that is proving to be very informative, well filmed and detailed information all of which this DVD lacked.",1317600000,6,1261,4.186721991701245
8379793,5,B002T44YYI,"For the price, I found this dvd helpful. I always wish I could really be in an over the shoulder position for learning and dvds are about the best for this kind of teaching.",1301356800,,173,4.117647058823529
