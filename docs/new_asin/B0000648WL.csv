7960431,5,B0000648WL,"The One Year War ends here.
 At last the war between the Federation and the Zeons ends. These last four episodes of the original Gundam are filled with action that there aren't any wasted moments. Of course, that doesn't mean that character development isn't slighted. These last four episodes set up the emnity between Char and Amuro that is resolved years later in Char's Counterattack. We also see the relationships between Amuro and Lalah, Char and Sayla, Char and Kycilia and Hayato and Frau Bow. I am looking forward to Char's Counterattack and I have one question: When will we see Z Gundam?",1026259200,5,598,4.805825242718447
