8001081,5,B0000DI87E,It's a production I return to when the need to see performances and a superb drama that are timeless and so very profound.  The memory of seeing this on PBS many years ago and how it has stuck with me throughout the years is a testament to the power of theater and of characters that are so well drawn that one believes those must be the people that live just next door or across the hall.  Excellence on every level.,1363392000,,417,4.2
8001082,5,B0000DI87E,"This 1974 production by the Negro Ensemble is a powerful  play with emotional characters, gospel music, and unrequited  love.  The setting is the Warren apartment bound for demolition, on the southside of Chicago.  It is occupied by an elderly mother, Weedie Warren, and her spinster daughter Alberta.

Visiting periodically is Weedie's brother, Uncle Doc, played by Scatman Crothers, a drinker, a smooth dresser and he loves to play the numbers.  Alberta is also a drinker,  pill popper, frustrated, and has been driven up the wall by her overbearing and meddling mother, who calls Alberta a whiskey head.

While mother goes back to the south for a convocation, she observes the civil rights movements and its uprising, something not quite in Chicago yet.  Meanwhile, a street singer named Blind Jordan wanders the neighborhood, looking for a woman he knew.  Alberta invites him in and soon befriends him.

Witness a powerful performance, possibly 10-12 minute soliloquy by Alberta as she recites her most memorable obituary she wrote for a love she craved, Emmanuel Fisher.  Then, she displays the sexual frustration reliving her angst at his funeral.  This performance by veteran actor Mary Alice is worth the watch.

The play's title Sty of the Blind Pig is in actuality a house of ill repute that Blind Jordan tells about, where women, whiskey and food were sold.  We also learn more of Weedie's past.

Because of Weedie's faith, gospel music is often heard in the background, such as Precious Lord, Farther Along, and Amazing Grace.  The actors have all had extensive television experience.  This is a wonderful play.

8001083,5,B0000DI87E,"This production was a powerful example of the magic of the stage. After a complete development of characters, the drama unfolded. I was immersed in the pool of guessing and assumptions at many turns. The names and careers of some of these performers have gone into the realm of near obscurity. Nevertheless, the enduring quality of archives lends a degree of immortality to cinema.
