My wife commented on the low budget and then found out they did not translate many words accurately from English to Spanish (she is Hispanic, so she would know).  So If you are looking for accuracy, it is best to look elsewhere.",1302480000,,293,4.3090909090909095
8281236,5,B001B19XXC,"What a great DVD!  It even worked on a 45 year old Mom with failing memory skills...kudos to the creator of this dandy learning tool.  Kids will not only watch the ""lessons"" (which aren't long enough to lose their attention) but they will retain what they've learned.  I loved the way a quick review is included in the next lesson, so you use (and therefore keep) what you just learned yesterday.
  That little boy who demonstrates the sign language is entertaining all by himself.  Great Product! Thanks!",1217980800,,505,4.747126436781609
8281237,5,B001B19XXC,"Being a first time mother, I found it frustrating being unable to know what my daughter was trying to tell me.  Even though she is not yet able to speak, she starting picking up on the Sign Language presented in this DVD right away.  The schedule is brief enough and the pictures are colorful enough to keep her interested. I was very surprised how quickly she started mimicking what was on the screen.  I'm very excited that she has not only been signing, but showing real understanding of what the signs mean when spoken.  It seems that the more she learns, the easier it is to prevent ""tantrums"" from her being frustrated: instead of crying or reaching out for things, she signs what she wants.  I'm looking forward to watching her develop her vocabulary in English and Spanish, in addition to her signing, which I'm sure will be of great benefit to her as she grows up.  This is a wonderful learning DVD.",1217289600,,908,4.539877300613497
8281238,5,B001B19XXC,"This is a great tool for parents wishing to share the gift of language with their children. It is so kid/parent friendly yet has the substance to give a solid foundation for learning new communication skills. My son and I watch a half hour of it one day. The next day we I were at a funeral (of all places) and I glance over at him and his is signing to me "" I am hungry"" and then ""I am hungry for food and juice"". Wow! Needless to say, I highly recommend this educational DVD.",1216512000,,477,4.031578947368421
8281239,5,B001B19XXC,"I am amazed by this video and how quickly my little one responded. I think children, even if they are under one, are able to learn sign easier then language itself. I highly recommend this video to all new parents. It will aid your baby to communicate to you earlier than if you wait for them to learn to speak.",1213833600,,311,4.2
