6424759,1,B00KFRBJVM,I love this series so I was very excited to find a box set. When it came today half the seasons were damaged and falling apart so not happy check each season thoroughly when you receive it,1464134400,9,188,4.108108108108108

6424762,5,B00KFRBJVM,A very Great show I all ready have all seasons I grow up watching xena when the show use to be on tv Years ago now that I all ready have all seasons I can watch them all the time,1460505600,2,178,3.475
6424763,5,B00KFRBJVM,"A great set which include all 6 seasons together with english subts for the first time.
 so if u did not bought the new seasons seperately u can buy them alltogether with this set.
 so far price is almost the same if u buy the seasons seperately or if u buy them alltogether with this set.
 as we speak the seperate seasons costs around 15 $ each which means all 6 seasons are around 90 $ if u buy them seperately while this set costs 98 $ but with the shipping difference the price is more or less the same.
 no new extras features are in this box set except the.....picture cover.

 now we wait for season 6 of hercules to be released and then for a similar box set with all 6 seasons including hopefully the tv movies left out in the re-release of season 1 which contain only the first 13 season episodes and not the tv movies which were shown before those episodes.
 so far those tv movies are only in season 1 set released a decade before but with no english subts.

 hope they will release them now together with hercules season 6 imcluding english subts which is the reason for all the fans who need subts to buy those sets.",1459987200,12,1131,4.223255813953489

6424781,4,B00KFRBJVM,I love Xena. These DVDs are mostly clear to watch. They are sometimes grainy in places. More care could have been taken to clean it up. For the price it is a good value. My Star Trek DVDs were crisp and clear but they were also $50 for 3 seasons. Xena includes 6 seasons for about $20.,1523491200,,285,4.017543859649122

It has awesome character development that I have never seen before, especially with Gabrielle. I will say that if you are willing to look past the cheesy sfx, this show is a diamond on the rough. Just give it a chance!",1515888000,4,350,4.571428571428571

6424811,5,B00KFRBJVM,"This is a perfectly priced collection of Xena. The quality is spot on as of yet. I have not encountered any skips or freezes in video. It is a pretty cheesy series as is Hercules Legendary Journeys, but I still enjoy it. Like an adult Saturday morning cartoon.",1515715200,,260,4.4375
6424812,4,B00KFRBJVM,"exactly what I wanted. Netflix recently sent the series to me and I do need to say that their dvd quality was better, but it was good enough, and besides if you are watching this then film quality is not really a priority.",1513296000,,222,4.186046511627907
6424813,3,B00KFRBJVM,"I am going to compare these to the old anchor bay releases - I have them all but when I moved out of the parents hours years ago my sister moved into my room and she wound up losing discs. So I bought these to fill in the missing basically (while still keeping whats left from the AB sets.).

Pro: I do like that they put the whole seasons into standard sized dvd cases as it is a great space saver when you have a bunch of seasons of different shows. The whole series cost less that what one season of the AB sets when they were released (but it's an old show now so that's probably why.

Cons: This set is only Stereo audio where as Anchor Bay was 5.1
No extra at all where as the AB had directors cuts, commentaries, interviews and other stuff (unless you count trailers for other shows - which I don't).
For some reason Season one came in a solid black DVD case while the others were clear so you can view the episodes on each disc while the case was open - Season one does have this list but well can't see it since the case is solid black (Did Universal/great-tv-shows.com run out of clear cases or what?)

Undecided: I haven't watch every episode yet because it's 98+ hours but so far all the discs look fine - I will update if there are an issues watch any of the discs. I have read some of the later episodes are in wide screen but I don't ever remember that and all the old AB episodes are 4:3. Also ""The Way"" may be the edited version (I wouldn't know if it is or not now since I haven't seen the original that originally aired on TV. - and I haven't gotten to watching that season yet.)

Basically if you have the old AB series and aren't missing any discs there really isn't a reason to get this. If you want them more compact you can buy multi-dvd cases much cheaper and make your own cover art and insert with episode list.

If you don't own the series (or are missing discs) it's a good buy since the old AB's are a heck of a lot more expensive since they have been out of print for so long",1513123200,23,2006,4.081218274111675
6424814,5,B00KFRBJVM,I can never get enough Xena: Warrior Princess or Hercules. Would have loved the show to have gone on for a few more seasons. I noticed that the Season 6 discs were different from the previous Seasons. They used symbols that weren't obvious what they meant except the play button.,1512518400,,279,4.6
6424815,5,B00KFRBJVM,Love it!,1509667200,,8,3.5
6424816,4,B00KFRBJVM,"Overall really good.

I had one partially defective DVD (season 2 episode 1) gets about half way through and then skips to the next episode. Not the biggest deal.",1509408000,,162,4.586206896551724

6424827,5,B00KFRBJVM,"I'm sorry, there is no better show.. I still watch it!  The chemistry between the main cast is incredible, the writing can't be surpassed.  I've seen shows that came after Xena, that have copied themes from some of the episodes!  There's comedy, drama, action.. it has it all.  I just wish they'd come out with a reunion movie (with the original cast).

One thing about the show.. would be nice if they found a way to transition it to BluRay.. would love to see it in higher def (if possible) on a large screen.",1502323200,,511,4.3936170212765955

6424832,5,B00KFRBJVM,"Words can not express how great this show is, but I will try to review this product anyway.  This is a initial review of Xena Warrior Princess Complete Series DVD Box Set Region 1 Slimline Edition.  For many collectors this is the Holy Grail of box sets in that it contains every episode of what many consider to be the greatest show of all time.  This is the reissued DVD set that Universal commissioned back in 2010 and was released in 2016.  It contains 30 DVDs in 6 individual slimline cases that hold 5 DVDs each.  All six cases are housed in a sturdy cardboard picture box with 1 side open to retrieve each season.  The slimline cases are made of a brittle clear plastic that may have small pieces to break off from time to time.  However this will not effect the cases operation.  The cases are also color coded to match each seasion of the DVDs.  The DVDs arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  They were a good value in that I was able to get the complete Xena set and the 1st seasion of Hurcules for about $60 US with tax and shipping included on Prime Day.  I tested the first DVD of the first seasion for this review using an HD HDMI Upscaleing DVD Player and an HD LCD TV and I was able to play Xena in full wide screen filling up the entire TV screen in near Blu Ray quality with the Upscaleing capabilities of my DVD player.  The picture is clear and sharp and the color is very vivid and you can adjust everything to your taste.  The sound is CD quality and will work with surround sound systems.  The DVD menus are very straight forward and easy to navigate.  The only extras that are included is English closed caption.  All in all this is a very good box set.  The show itself is a mixture of action, drama, romance and comedy; so there is something for everybody.  If you want to look deeper into what this show is, like Hurcules it is a modern interpretation of a Greek tragedy set in ancient times.  What makes Xena different than Hurcules is that Hurcules is a story of perseverance and Xena is a story of redemption.  That's what makes her story so unique.  It's also one of very few shows that has 2 female leads.  This show never takes itself too seriously but the fan base for this show takes it very seriously.  At the height of the show's popularity in the mid 90s this show was watched by over 10 million people worldwide in syndication and to this day has a fan base of over a quarter of a million people strong.  The Xena fan base is pushing for a Blu Ray release of all sessions with extras, a blockbuster movie on the big screen with the original cast tentavely titled something like ""Xena Warrior Princess Resurrection"" or #XWPR and NBC/Universal would like to reboot Xena on the small screen with a new cast possibly reincarnating all of the characters into new bodies.  Well, good luck with that and Battle On!",1500163200,5,2859,4.338983050847458

Beware, it enjoys gender bending in several episodes and will make transgender people laugh at the episode about the beauty contest.

6424850,5,B00KFRBJVM,This is my favorite series of all time.  I used to pretend I was Xena when I was little so to have this on DVD it pretty awesome. I like the way it was packed with each season in its own case.,1490572800,3,192,3.5714285714285716
6424851,5,B00KFRBJVM,My wife was so upset when Netflix took Xena off instant streaming. Now she is very happy.,1488758400,8,89,4.294117647058823
6424852,4,B00KFRBJVM,"The series is great, perfect even, but the discs will not play when I try to play them in my computer. DVD players, PS3s, PS4s, and all those things run them perfectly, however, so there's no big loss on that front.

Additionally, there are no special features. Apparently the old DVD set had all sorts of things - bloopers, behind the scenes, you name it - but this one is devoid of all that. In fact, the DVD menus are nearly devoid of text, as well. The icons are easily identifiable, so it isn't that much of a problem.

A nitpick I have is that they put the episode guide for the DVDs on the underside of the cover slip, meaning you have to take out the last DVD in each case to see what the episodes on the last two discs are. Annoying, yes, but if you don't care about the spines of your cases not showing which season you're looking at, you can simply flip the cover slip around.

For anyone wondering, the episodes play in a 4:3 aspect ratio, not widescreen as it's 2016 release would imply. The quality is identical to that of what was on Netflix.

All in all, it's a great box set. With the minor nitpicks, I want to give it a 4.5 star rating... But since I can't, a 4 will have to suffice.

Note to potential buyers: 3 of the cases in my set have minor damage, but as it was all shrink wrapped that way and no plastic pieces were found, it's likely that it happened at the factory. It doesn't hurt the discs or how the box set looks, and the cases still work perfectly. While it isn't an issue for me, I thought it was worth a mention all the same.",1487980800,20,1560,4.135313531353136

6424858,5,B00KFRBJVM,I thoroughly enjoyed reacquainting my self with the series.

6424863,4,B00KFRBJVM,Love Zena Warrior princess but please release on Blu-ray or UHD (or at least make it available in digital HD online conduits such as VUDU) This product would sell much better if on blu ray. Fanboys and girls would eat it up. Also the final 2 seasons were shot in anomopheric wide screen and could be released that way.,1482364800,,318,4.406779661016949
6424864,5,B00KFRBJVM,Love it... my sister is going to go nuts on Christmas. I'm a big fan of the show as well. I own the original did collectors edition releases. These are just as great quality and the seas plastic disc retainers are a plus compared to the original releases which featured folded card stock discuss retainers.

6424883,2,B00KFRBJVM,"Unfortunately the series isn't uncut, the last three seasons have been cropped to full screen again. Xena was actually produced for widescreen from season 4 onwards, so we are missing a significant amount on both sides.

Checked all the seasons disks and they are correct and appear flawless, and cases were wrapped in cellophane not shrink wrap. Half way through season 3 and no issues. Sure it's DVDs and looks like it, but knew that goin in, just happy to relive the silly fun from the past, and the subtitles are a nice addition, but there are no extras, Will double dip if and when they remaster this on blu.
