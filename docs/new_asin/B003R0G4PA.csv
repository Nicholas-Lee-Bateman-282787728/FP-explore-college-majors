4172230,3,B003R0G4PA,"I am a WW II buff and this series is good but has many flaws.  The narrator is good and for the most part
accurate but he may be talking of the bombing of Germany by B-17s and B-24s but the viedo is showing B-29's
bombing Japan. There are many flaws similar to this and a novice would not catch it.  The series is good
but not the best if you are looking for accuracy in what you are seeing as the narrator describes the action.",1344470400,,428,3.9651162790697674
4172231,2,B003R0G4PA,"My daughter gave this to me as a gift, so I have tried to struggle through it. But it is painful to listen to the narrator. It almost sounds like a computer generated voice reading a poorly written script. The graphics and background music are hokey and distracting. Like another reviewer mentioned, the case is a double thick case and it refers to five episodes so I expected to find multiple DVDs. Instead, there was just one inside, rattling around loose in a paper sleeve!

I found it interesting that while the narrator was reciting early attempts at flight in the 1600s to early 1800s, his comments were illustrated by early movie footage that is vaguely related to the story line being narrated.  It was as if the viewer is meant to believe that this footage depicts events that happened 100s of years before the first movie camera was invented. It definitely doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the accuracy of the rest of the film.

On the other hand the producers seem to have collected a rather comprehensive collection of early aviation footage, some of which is very interesting, so I will probably suffer through the bad narration to see it. Or just turn off the sound.",1343779200,,1186,4.6650717703349285
4172232,1,B003R0G4PA,"This DVD comes with cool packaging. That is the good thing about this DVD. The quality of the visuals
 IS POOR TO USELESS.There is no continuity in the way the story is told. Aircraft types often do not fit the narration. Also planes are miss identified.
Do not waste your money on this garbage!

4172233,3,B003R0G4PA,"I bought this locally for only $5, so I really didn't know what to expect.

First off, I'd like to agree with other reviewers that the narration is, how should I put it, odd.
The narrator is obviously not a native English speaker as he repeatedly says things like ""aircrafts"", ""radars"", and my favorite ""refrigerating system of the motor oil"" (instead of ""oil cooling system""). He also has a really harsh ""T"" when he speaks and doesn't always pronounce the same word the same way, which can be distracting. The biggest flaw with the narration however, is the flow, or lack thereof. The closest thing I can use as a reference is how my wife's Kindle sounds when it is ""reading"" a book aloud. Yeah, it gets all the information to you, but since it doesn't understand what it's saying, it isn't able to place emphasis where it belongs, so the result is choppy and sometimes awkward.
Also, weights and distances are all in metric, so many of us Americans can easily get lost and not really have a feel of size or weight during the show.
Speeds are in knots, so that may or may not annoy you.

The video footage on the other hand, is much better. All of the footage was turned to a sepia tone for continuity (I'm sure a lot of this footage was originally gray), and aside from a few flipped shots (reversed tail numbers and such) and some shots of incorrect planes, it's pretty good stuff. For example, I had never seen footage of C-47s tugging Waco CG-4 gliders before, and it's in here!
My only real complaint about the video is the animated planes during the aircraft description segments. They have a really cool title format which shows a vertical line to one side of the screen. The name of the aircraft gets printed along that line (sideways) and slides toward the top, while the narrator is popping off a few specifications. Unfortunately during this, a drawing of the aircraft is floating across some goofy background. I would have kept the titles and narration, but instead of the animated drawings, would have just shown a still frame of the real aircraft.

The other complaint I have is a physical one. This ""5 part documentary"" comes in a double-wide DVD case but only contains 1 DVD. Yep, it takes up twice as much space, but everything is on 1 DVD. This is disappointing mostly because it's not an epic series like the Discovery Channel's ""When We Left Earth"", that I'll watch over and over (that set, by the way, is on 4 DVDs and only takes up the space of 1), but it'll take up more than its fair share of shelf space.

Is it an epic warbird documentary? Not so much.
Is it worth $5? Probably.",1302825600,4,2605,4.489451476793249
4172234,2,B003R0G4PA,"This would be a very interesting DVD if it wasn't for the absolutely TERRIBLE narration.  The footage is great, lots of interesting clips I've never seen before, but this is the only redeeming quality.  The narrator speaks fluent english, however it appears that whoever wrote the script had only been speaking english for 2 weeks whenever this was written.  Upon reading the credits, it appears that it was indeed translated, which explains a lot.  There are also several factual errors throughout the documentary.

Its a shame, because any decent english speaker could have corrected the errors, and made this 1000x better.  Its almost humorous, because at times it seems that the narrator is actually struggling to accurately reproduce the incorrect english on the script!!  I'm giving it 2 stars for the footage, it loses 3 stars because of the dialogue.",1297987200,7,858,5.085714285714285
4172235,1,B003R0G4PA,"While this dvd has reasonably good footage, the narration by a person for whom English is a second language detracts from the content.  Also within the first few minutes several factual errors were noted by both my daughter and myself.

Really you'd be better off looking at wikipedia with a screen reader.",1295049600,12,306,4.865384615384615
4172236,5,B003R0G4PA,"The DVD, with the five episodes, covers the discovery of flight from the early pioneers experimenting with hot air balloons, heavier-than-air aircraft, so on, to the early combat planes of the Great War, the inventions and developments between the wars, and the major events, turning points, and new technologies that effected World War Two.
The DVD does a amazing job of covering much of the history of military air craft, including the use of airships and rockets.

8402783,1,B003R0G4PA,"LACK OF EDITING. This 'documentary' suffered from inaccuracy and poor coordination of visual content with the narration. For example, the narrator states that Italy entered World War 2 on June 11th, 1939 - that is, THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN! For another example, the narrator refers to Italy's CR.42 biplane as the ""CR.43"". And on it goes, throughout the entire presentation. And as a previous post indicated, the film shows aircraft, which are not being discussed. Anyone not already familiar with the aircraft types would be seriously misled by this poorly edited project. This DVD is going into the garbage can; I would feel wrong about passing it on to anyone else.",1504483200,,677,5.0
8402784,1,B003R0G4PA,"Here's a video that covers a half century of aviation in about 4 hours. It spends a couple of sentences on each event. I agree with the other one star reviewers that while the film clips are OK, the narration is horrible, and mistakes are everywhere. Just two examples from numerous possibilities: not once, not twice, but three times the narrator said that the allies bombed ""the destroyer Tirpitz,"" downsizing Germany's massive battleship to a destroyer.

I also got a kick out of it when they called Admiral Yamamoto's flag ship the ""Yamamoto."" He meant, of course, the huge battleship ""Yamato.""

Read the other one star reviews and decide for yourself if it's worth five bucks for this video.",1475366400,,696,4.840336134453781
