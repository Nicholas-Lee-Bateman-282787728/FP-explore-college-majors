4683118,3,B005FLSZQA,"After a couple of recent ""Chipmunk"" purchases which were great, this selection was OK at best.  Don't waste your $$s unless you really have a thing for these guys.",1323561600,,163,4.620689655172414
4683119,4,B005FLSZQA,"My second grader loves Alvin and the Chipmunks and with Christmas approaching, I got this DVD so we can enjoy watching the chipmunks. There are four holiday episodes all digitally restored, at a total running time of 88 minutes: ""A Chipmunk Christmas"", ""It's a Wonderful Life, Dave"", ""Alvin's Christmas Carol"", and ""A Chipmunk Celebration"". There are some cute Chipmunk takes on classic holiday tunes such as Jingle Bells, Deck the Halls, and the Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late). Of all the little chipmunks, Alvin (typical) discovers that it is indeed better to give than to receive.

The bonus CD contains several of the Chipmunks' famous holiday tracks, i.e. ""The Chipmunk Song"", ""It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas"", ""A Comes Before B"", ""Petit Papa Noel"" with Celine Dion, ""Here Comes Christmas"", ""Wonderful Day"", ""Chipmunk Jingle Bells"", and ""Deck the Halls/ We Wish You a Merry Christmas"". This set makes a great Christmas stocking stuffer for Chipmunks fans of all ages.",1322956800,30,988,5.175
4683120,4,B005FLSZQA,"I got this as a gift for an almost-four-year-old who is new to the Chipmunks. Let me tell you it was lots of fun to watch her enjoy it, since we watched and listened to the Chipmunks when we were only a bit older than she. (1958!!)

This is a good DVD with three different stories, and every one is a winner. Certainly, you can't go wrong for the price.",1321401600,11,353,4.042857142857143
4683121,3,B005FLSZQA,"So,  I haven't seen this specific DVD, so I am reviewing the content according to the editorial review.  It states it includes ""A Chipmunk Christmas, Its a Wonderful Life Dave and Alvin's Christmas Carol"".  So, these have already been released on at least 2 previous DVDs.  The Chipmunk's Christmas is a classic special,  So if you don't already have it, it is a great one to get. (Short outline - The Chipmunks are getting ready to prepare for a big concert where they will debut their ""New"" song - Christmas Don't Be Late, and Alvin is too busy since he just HAS to get a golden harmonica.  When Alvin meets a sick little boy, he starts to rethink his priorities.).  Alvin's Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life Dave are both decent episodes,  although the latter is NOT a Christmas episode (despite the episode title). It also includes the Chipmunk Celebration episode. Their relatives are coming out to see them in the community play.  Aside of a pilgrim themed play,  this episode does not actually have much of a Thanksgiving theme.  So if you already have these episodes on DVD - these are just repeats.",1316131200,7,1115,4.666666666666667

This is one present I got to give to my daughters early so they could enjoy it throughout the Christmas season.  Even though there is a two year difference in age of my girls they both wanted to watch it over and over.  I doubt there are any children who would not be charmed by those high pitched voices.

4683179,2,B005FLSZQA,"The reason for the low rating is that I thought I'd read this contained the official cartoon of the Chipmunks singing, ""Christmas Don't be Late.""  I wanted this to show to my group of young elementary kids who LOVE Alvin, especially the, ""Alvin, Alvin...ALLLLLVINNNN.."" ...""OK!!!!"" part.  That isn't here at all. The song is sung/ played twice. Once is when the chipmunk babies are decorating for Christmas. That's sort of cute if you like them as babies and just want to see footage of such things as popcorn going onto a tree. The main segment on here of them singing the song is pitiful. Much of it is just their shadows as they sing (what's the point of that? were the artists on strike? seriously). And there's no trademark pre-song shouting interaction between Dave and Alvin.
  I hate to be a Grinch, but if you buy this wanting the old time Chipmunks singing the song we all know and love, look on Youtube and just hope you can find an old, scratchy copy.",1419120000,,963,4.5491329479768785

4683187,5,B005FLSZQA,At least all three Alvin Christmas episodes on DVD. I do want to cover problems other reviewers mentioned. All 4 episodes do play. Thankfully the company that produces the DVD fixed that problem. One reviewer said that there are black water marks throughout the episodes. There are not any black water marks. I'm not sure if those people had defective disks or if the company fixed the problems. I will admit the quality is not DVD quality the animation was not restored. I am just happy that all 4 episodes play and there are no black water marks. I almost didn't buy this due to the negative reviews. I am very glad I bought this. Considering you are getting 4 episodes for $9 you can't expect the company to restore the animation.,1417564800,2,733,4.5606060606060606

I also rented this same video from the library before I bought it and it had the same issue. Basically when you hit ""play all episodes"" it plays the first one and then stops. If you try to play each of the following 3 episodes manually the title of the episode comes up and then the screen goes black and takes you back to the main menu. I have a feeling this is a manufacture issue. It seems like a couple/few other people got the video and didn't have this problem  so maybe it only happened to some of the DVDs while they were being made. I wouldn't risk getting another one again though.",1388102400,,718,4.128571428571429

I remember when growing up watching this in my native tongue, and they sound just as natural (perhaps because it's all high pitched) but their demeanors are definitely on point.  Alvin, Simon, Theodore the way I remember them!... and Dave of course, who can forget the grouchy Dave!  This special includes their version of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" so you really want to pick this up.  Nothing like a good'ol realistic cartoon that doesn't sugar coat things for kids (like cartoons nowadays).",1386892800,9,647,4.792792792792793

4683208,5,B005FLSZQA,These are some good episodes of The Chipmunks show. We have one where they put on a Thanksgiving show for their family but not before they get nervous about trying something new. In another one we have an Its a Wonderful Life theme when David gets a chance to see how the Chipmunks lives would've been without him. Another one had sort of  A Christmas Carol theme with one difference. Alvin instead of hating Christmas likes it too much particularly the part about getting gifts missing that Christmas is about giving and is visited by three ghosts. And speaking of Christmas and giving we also have their Christmas movie where Alvin didn't lose the true spirit of Christmas but is accused of it after he gives his harmonica to a sick kid and then must quickly raise money to get another one after David books a Christmas eve concert for Simon Theodore and him at Carnage Hall which includes him doing a harmonica solo. You should get this. Merry Christmas,1386201600,,956,4.623529411764705

4683221,2,B005FLSZQA,"In this Christmas classic Dave lectures the chipmunks about the true meaning of Christmas, while simultaneously pimping the chipmunks at a recording session over Christmas vacation. Dave needs the chipmunks to maintain his posh uptown lifestyle, but when the chipmunks try to exercise their entrepreneurial spirit and open up a photo booth, man, do they catch a beating. Dave doesn't want the chipmunks to make money unless he gets his 98%. After Dave discovers Alvin gave his prize harmonica to a sick child, his cold heart melts, and he allows Mrs. Claus to buy Alvin a new harmonica. Actually after watching this 200 times this year, it's starting to grow on me. It's one of my wife's favorites and my 2 year old likes it as well. All of that doesn't help the piss poor animation cheesy story but i guess there are worse Christmas specials.",1356307200,2,843,4.780821917808219

4683229,4,B005FLSZQA,"I really am a huge fan of the old school ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" TV show.  I purchased this item because I received a large amount of enjoyment from watching it with my sister's children over Christmas.  Here is the reason I only gave it four stars.  Throughout several of the episodes on the disc, large amounts of black watermarks appear on the screen.  I know this is because several of the episodes are made from the mid 80s, but the watermarks are very distracting to me when I watch the shows.  I always think something is wrong with my DVD player.  If you love the old, ""Alvin and the Chipmunk"" show, you should definitely purchase this item.  You will receive much enjoyment from watching the Chipmunks old holiday themed episodes.  Just don' be surprised if you notice large amounts of black watermarks while episodes are played.",1329350400,4,840,4.666666666666667
