8434560,5,B004LPFQMW,I have many Benoit books and videos. These guys never cease to amaze me. Just be warned that they tell you like it is. They don't hunt over food plots in tree stands. They hunt deer like they were meant to be: like the prey they are. And there are no short cuts. It takes old fashioned hard work and determination to kill bucks like they do. They are fun to watch and listen too. I have learned alot from these guys. May Larry rest in piece.,1419120000,,441,4.080459770114943
8434561,5,B004LPFQMW,"Great DVD for an avid deer hunter.  Most great deer hunters try to get their hands on as much information concerning deer hunting as they can.  Larry Benoit started deer hunting when he was nine years old and in the 1970's he was featured in many magazines as one of the greatest deer hunters around. He is in his late 80's and still gets a buck every year.  He and his family hunt in a couple of states and Canada. They are mainly snow trackers, however a large portion of this DVD is devoted to dry ground hunting. Together they have killed hundreds of big bucks and in so doing have obtained a vast storehouse of knowledge.  Larry is a great storyteller.  He once tracked a buck for thirteen days before finally connecting.  His son Lanny tracked a buck so aggressively that the buck finally, out of fatigue and desperation, charged him! I only wish Larry would do a book or DVD of deer hunting stories and experiences.  Excellent DVD!",1328140800,,938,4.482352941176471
