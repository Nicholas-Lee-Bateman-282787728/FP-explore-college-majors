5921062,5,B00EJ4NK9G,"I simply love this season of Baywatch season 9. Season 8 got a bunch of scattered pretty looking actresses. The story lines went all over the place.

But, Baywatch season 9, became more serious, action, drama. Only 3 actresses on the show. These women are talented. Like Brooke Burns as Jessie Owens for example. She does 90% of the stunts by herself. She is very athletic and a good swimmer. And a knockout body guys go for. Kelly Packard also looks pretty continuing with season 9. Mitzi Kapture as Alex Ryker plays an excellent liutenant. Compared to actress Angelica Bridges as Taylor Walsh, no offense.

This is a great season to watch. A shortening of cast, yet interesting to watch. Like going back to its old school Baywatch season 1 and 2 roots. This is also the last of Cody Madison, played by actor David Chokachi. Because in the year 2000, he picked up the role as rookie detective Jake McCarty in fantasy, action, drama, Witchblade.",1328572800,6,945,4.686746987951807
