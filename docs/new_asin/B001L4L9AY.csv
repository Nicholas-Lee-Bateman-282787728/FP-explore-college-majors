3678449,5,B001L4L9AY,"This video was very helpful, with a good overview of multiple techniques, anatomy, and contraindications. The format is easy to follow.",1318464000,2,135,5.476190476190476
3678450,5,B001L4L9AY,"This is an excellent introduction to canine massage. The instructor clearly demonstrates each technique in an accessible way and he also obviously loves what he does. I'd recommend watching it through once, and then massaging your pets during the video as you watch it a second time. I also recommend supplementing your learning with a book, and for that, the Michael J. Fox ""Healing Touch"" series can't be beat. However, even without a book, this video should impart more than enough skills to have you massaging your animals at home.

Also, the 23 anatomy charts shown at the end of the DVD are worth the price alone (look up the price of similar charts). I printed them all out for personal reference. After viewing this video, you should be able to massage your personal pets.",1307145600,11,780,4.777777777777778
3678451,4,B001L4L9AY,"I thought this Massage DVD was very informative.  It helps to be able to see the strokes and pressure, etc.  Am seriously thinking of taking classes from person who did DVD.",1292112000,4,173,4.548387096774194
3678452,5,B001L4L9AY,"This is a well-balanced, well scripted, erudite learning tool.  You can clearly see each massage technique.  Contraindications are specified not only in the menu selection, but also in particular massage examples where it is of particular importance.  There is a lot of information to absorb, but as with anything worth doing, it is wise to go over each section methodically and with patience.  As a lay person, I have no prior knowledge of massage, however, I am aware that you can't just go pushing, rubbing and pressing ad lib.  More harm than good can come of such an approach and in this dvd, they advise the right way to go about these techniques and what to look for.  There are constant reminders to seek professional help from veterinarians, animal chiropractors etc, if you are in any doubt, and that's exactly how it should be.

I plan to take the first couple of sections and just get to know my dog under my hands, guided by the animal and the dvd.  I mention this only because the amount of information could be overwhelming and rushing at it, or giving up, would be a shame.  There are great benefits for giver and receiver of massage.

I've never heard of this company, so it's always a risk purchasing something especially when there are no reviews.  I am relieved it has exceeded my expectations because we're all feeling a pinch with the economy.  No money wasted here.

The gentleman narrating and demonstrating, has a real love for the dogs.  He just oozes compassion and empathy for them.  He has a soft, gently commanding voice and really seems to understand his subject.  I liked the pace and I liked the background music especially at the end with 'still' shots of the participating dogs.  This may seem irrelevant to the reader of this review, but I mention it because it instilled in me a deep resonance of love for the dogs and animals in general who give us so much. In particular the expression of 'Addy' the Great Dane humbled me.  Animals are our silent witnesses to the chaos 'we' create in our world and often they are the brunt of our negative actions.  These final shots were a nice closure to an excellent program.  The least we can do, is to regularly let them feel a loving hand to say ""Thank You"".  Here is an excellent tool to help you do that.",1268870400,29,2285,4.565110565110565
8317179,5,B001L4L9AY,I so wish I could have gone to the school who did this. I learned more things in this DVD than the school I went to for 3 days but then I think I am going to the worst dog massage school in history. If you went or are going to a good school where they actually teach you massage strokes this would be very repetitive for you. You go to a school like I am this is wonderful. They have another one I smile going to buy.,1503100800,,417,3.75

8317187,4,B001L4L9AY,We show this video in our grooming salon to encourage others to participate in their pets health and well being. Many have purchased the video themselves or ask us to give their pet a mini massage after a day of  grooming at the Paw Spa. Kim,1361404800,,241,4.239130434782608
8317188,4,B001L4L9AY,"Nick is one of those people who has that special connection with animals. From the opening moments of this video, you know you're in the presence of someone you'll learn from. And it's true - he demonstrates and explains a long list of holistic massage techniques which seem to fit with what little I know from past experience with massage, anatomy, and yoga with humans. I learned a lot, and frankly just seeing his approach and hearing his tone of voice when working with dogs was very informative for me.

What I didn't get was a simple start-to-finish routine for a beginner like myself. (In all fairness, Nick does not advertise his DVD as that, so this is not a complaint.) My chocolate lab is aging, and I'd just like to spend a few minutes every few days doing some basic stretches and massages to keep him relatively limber and comfortable as he ages. I've since found some other sources that provide this, and Nick's video is a terrific supplement to those, as he really goes into detail. He even provides many anatomical charts at the end of the video, which are really informative.",1353196800,5,1093,4.634020618556701
