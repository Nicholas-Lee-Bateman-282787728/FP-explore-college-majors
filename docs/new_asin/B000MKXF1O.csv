8169753,1,B000MKXF1O,"I was an educator at this camp and I was disappointed to find out that the camp taught the children to be stars not actors. I looked at this film with dismay as I saw once again elitism being encouraged. The sense that just because you can sing, dance or act better does not make you a better person then others around you who also enjoy the theatre. The mind games that are played on the kids by the ""directors"" can really mess up a young person's mind and made me sick. The main director looks like he came right out of ""Waiting for Guffman"". It is really ashame. The camp has the potential to be a great place of learning instead it is a place for spoiled rich kids to look down on others. My advice to the older kids at Stagedoor Manor is to go get a job at a Summer Stock Theatre and see how real theatre is performed and gain some valuable experience if they want to pursue a career on the stage",1478390400,2,901,4.096045197740113
8169754,2,B000MKXF1O,"This is really a missed opportunity.  The idea is solid and there have been some really great ""behind the scenes"" documentaries like First Position, and theatrical movies like ""Camp.""  But this movie suffers from too much drama about being at a summer camp, and not enough drama about putting on a show.  In addition, the cinematography is awful and it looks like it was shot on some terrible old school video camera.",1427760000,,417,4.763888888888889
8169755,5,B000MKXF1O,This movie offers an interesting sneak peek of the musical theater world! Great movie! The songs get stuck in my head!,1398384000,,118,4.666666666666667
8169756,3,B000MKXF1O,"The concept was promising, but the filmmakers probably had a narrow window to work with and pieced together the footage as best they could.

The film follows five students at this private performing arts school...well at least that what the opening says the film will be doing but they didn't follow those five more than any other interviewee like parents and staff members.

The film First Position is similar but gave you a stronger sense as to who were the main characters. Both films, sadly, don't bring us deeper into the hearts and lives of these children like a film like Hoop Dreams or Heart of.the Game.  There also didn't seem to be a climax like training for that one big performance that would rattle nerves and make futures.

If they had done this like the series Bug Juice, letting the story be told just by the children, it would have been great.",1367280000,,861,4.607843137254902
8169757,2,B000MKXF1O,"STAGEDOOR is a brutal documentary that exposes the bizarre methods of a theatrical summer camp for teens in the Catskills, and the awful people who staff it.  Not to mention it makes the children look like monsters.  Are there any agreeable characters in the movie?  Maybe one or two, but the filmmakers seem to delight in revealing the worst aspects of the theatrical personality.

I don't know who comes across worse.  There's the one male teacher with the artfully haystacked-up hair, who takes the honors drama class and tells them on their first meeting that there are one too many students in the group, and before the end of the class they are going to have to kick one out, and he forces each student in turn to name one who should be evicted.  Then at the end he tells them laughingly it was just an exercise.  Then there's the large woman who's the director I guess, who has a hissy fit over some bad student behavior and rounds them up, asking them why didn't they just spit at her.  Talk about a drama queen!  The film focuses on five students, but not very successfully.  None of them seem very talented, but is that just the luck of the draw, that sometimes doc-makers pick their subjects early and then they just peter out, or are they making a case against letting teens act?  The one black boy who plays the Tim Curry role in Annie has confidence, and a role in Broadway's THE LION KING on his resume, but he's got very little stage presence, while the girl Nicole seems to think she can get by on her comic antics offstage, it's painful to watch adolescent awkwardness this close up.

The actual operations of Stagedoor Manor are awesome--it's hard to believe that the staff can cast, direct, produce, rehearse and open twelve musicals in three weeks.  The weird thing is the built-in caste system.  Not all campers are equal, the best ones wind up in their own cabaret which they bring to seniors at two neighboring hotels, old men and women who looks barely alive, while up on the stage, the kids are singing and dancing their hearts out.  Non-cabaret kids are wildly jealous of the elite--it's just another layer of ugliness in a remarkably ugly film.",1244592000,11,2172,4.576227390180879
8169758,4,B000MKXF1O,"I thought the documentary was well done. I wish they would have done more at-home stuff with the kids they profiled the most to see how they interacted with their non-camp friends, but other than that it was pretty enjoyable. I thought it was perhaps a bit too short because we didn't really get to know anybody. It would have been interesting to have more about the coaches in there. It is definitely worth watching.",1233532800,4,417,4.573333333333333
