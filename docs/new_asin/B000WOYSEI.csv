8224700,4,B000WOYSEI,"I bought the GT-8 many years ago, around 2007. I never could get a good distortion sound out of it. I gave up. This DVD was a big help in understanding the beast, which is now pretty much obsolete(?) considering they have several new generations effects units out.
Still, when I first paid the 500.00 bucks for the GT-8, I did not like the sounds it created, at least through my amps. It sounded to sterile. I would try to do a fast 6th string chug, like in Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast,"" and there would be this artificial sound like a bee buzzing the whole time - not a clean broken chug.

I just did not have the knowledge of terms and overall understanding of the unit as I do now in 2018. And the reason I understand it is in large part due to this Lick Library DVD, along with the Roland DVD on this effects unit. Now I am please that I did not sell the GT-8, which costs me over $400.00, around 10 years ago.

One thing to note is that it is a 2-DVD set. And one of the DVD (disc 2) did not play and was not recognized by my DVD players or computers. The first disc stops suddenly but appears to be pretty much through the entire presentation except for the performances. Thank goodness for these DVDs!

(Note: In 2015, and I discovered a video on youtube from ""WhoDaBear"" videos. I copied the guys step-by-step instruction after I downloaded some new software someone created called ""GT-8 Floorboard."" Between the step-by-step, and the use of the free Floorboard software interface program, I finally got some great distortion for recording.)",1458000000,,1559,4.425087108013937
8224701,5,B000WOYSEI,"Michael Casswell gives you an excellent perspective on the Boss GT-8.

And unlike the Roland instructional DVD, his chapters are focused on setting up the GT-8 to obtain
usable tones.

He uses his experience as a gigging musician to frame the features of the GT-8, explaining why certain
features would be valuable to a guitarist.

One of the questions that he addressed right off was something that I had been pondering:
The why's and how's of using the preamp section vs. the OD/Dist. section.

I consider this product much more meaningful than Roland's instructional DVD about the GT-8.
I believe that Roland's DVD was focused more on bells and whistles, rather than using the GT-8
to get a desireable guitar tone.",1260144000,,717,4.900826446280992
8224702,1,B000WOYSEI,"This is supposed to be a two-DVD set.  The first time I received it, the first disc would play about 2/3's of the way through, then freeze up.  My DVD player wouldn't even recognize the second disc as being a disc.  Back it went for replacement.  The second set I received played the first disc okay until about 2/3's the way through, then it would start pixelizing and hanging up.  The second disc, although labeled as ""Disc 2"" was just another Disc 1.  Back it went.  Amazon refunded my money and wouldn't send me another replacement.  If I were you I'd keep looking.",1208822400,,569,4.456310679611651
