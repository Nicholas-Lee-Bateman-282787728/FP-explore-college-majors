4577769,4,B0055HK6XY,"Our family of cat lovers has watched the show on Animal Planet and are hooked on watching these adorable kittens antics.  Though we loved what we saw on the video, we purchased this video expecting more than just the one ""episode.""  We were hoping for an entire season of shows.  Very happy with the content, just wish there was more of it!",1339632000,9,340,4.451612903225806
4577770,5,B0055HK6XY,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter who is obsessed with all things cat.  She has watched it over and over for the last two months.  The first feature follows three momma cats as they give birth to, and then raise, their kittens.  One of the breeds is an Abyssinian, and my daughter now knows all about them.  They are her favorite (for now).  This film has provided hours and hours of educational entertainment to my very active 5 year old.  I even enjoyed watching it with her.  I wish I could find more just like it.",1330041600,9,524,4.232323232323233

4577783,5,B0055HK6XY,"This dvd contains the first too cute episode on kittens. It also included two episodes from cats 101. If you're a cat lover, I think this is worth buying. It's not only fun to watch but it's also educational.
A little advice, don't consider a new kitten just for seeing this stuff, especially if you already have a cat. A pet only comes when you're ready for it, in my opinion. Purchase this item for enjoyment at home and be happy with your present pet. That's what I do",1421539200,,471,4.303370786516854

4577785,3,B0055HK6XY,This is OK but not great. My child loves cat videos of any kind so this kept attention for a short while. After that though it's been collecting dust while other old cat-related movies/videos are still being used.,1415577600,,213,4.631578947368421

The joy of watching newborn animals without the time, mess, and sometimes heartache accompanied with having them in your own home.
We all get a baby animal fix, and a trip down memory lane when our animals were tiny.

Not graphic in the slightest.
