5949931,1,B00EXPOB5S,"Once upon a time, there was a girl who became a Hollywood superstar, and then she married a handsome prince from a faraway land. Okay, ""handsome"" is pushing it... he wasn't horribly unattractive. And now being a beautiful princess, she was the most important person in this land's history, and everything revolved around her.

Or at least, that is what ""Grace of Monaco"" would have you believe. This movie is almost a hypnotic experience -- it's filmed like a very long perfume commercial, with bizarrely precious acting from Nicole Kidman and a story that tries to combine international politics with a Disney Princess plot. It's a glossy, glazed experience with nothing at its center -- like a creampuff that someone forgot to inject cream into.

In 1956, Hollywood actress Grace Kelly (Kidman) retired from a successful film career -- including three movies with Alfred Hitchcock -- to marry Prince Rainier of Monaco (Tim Roth). It's a glamorous, glitzy life, hobnobbing with the wealthy and highly-placed. But six years later, France's Charles de Gaulle is puts pressure on Rainier, and without a military, Monaco doesn't have a real chance of defying the French.

And for... some reason, the presence of an ""outspoken"" (meaning she occasionally offers an opinion) American princess is suddenly a problem, both for the French and the people of Monaco. And no, apparently Grace NEVER realized this before or took any measures to fit in.

At the same time, Grace is considering a return to Hollywood after Hitchcock (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) offer her the lead role in ""Marnie,"" which would give her some freedom from the ""princess"" role (and a much-needed cash injection). But as the situation becomes more tense, Grace finds that being the perfect Monegasque princess might change her country's destiny.

One of the first things that one notices about ""Grace of Monaco"" is the way it's filmed -- soft-focus and full of gauzy, blurry light, like an expensive perfume commercial that drags on for two hours. It adds an extra layer of unreality to a movie that only vaguely resembles what actually happened, and whose main character is as ridiculously perfect and saintly as an early Disney princess.

How perfect was Grace? She was super smart and honest, an amazingly talented actress and a perfect mom; she wanted to build hospitals for the sick children; she figured out a treacherous plot against Monaco, and she saved Monaco by being the Perfectly Perfect Princess Whom Everybody Rightfully Worshipped, and making a hideous speech about believing in fairy tales that de Gaulle just can't resist. I was just waiting for the part where she turned water to wine and learned how to fly like Superman.

And how did this paragon of perfection cause everyone to worship the ground she walked on? Obvious photo ops, pretty clothes, and being taught how to waltz by Derek Jacobi. Yeah, it's really that shallow. And yet the final shots of the movie show Grace surrounded by light, while an angelic choir sings.

The sad fact is that Grace's whole subplot makes no sense, because it's set six years and two children into her marriage. Her ""oh noes, I don't know how to princess!"" dilemma might have worked if it came soon after marrying Rainier, or if the story stretched over those six years. Instead, it makes her ""shocking"" outspokenness and social gaffes seem rather ridiculous. Even the ""getting dressed for a reception"" scene is handled with such melodramatic seriousness that you would think Grace had never worn a pretty dress and a tiara before.

The reason it's set in the early sixties is... well, to be perfectly honest, it's probably because Nicole Kidman is fifteen years older than Grace was at this stage in her life, and the soft-focused cinematography can only hide so much. Kidman's performance is also quite bizarre -- very precious and girlish, with countless silly cheesy lines (such as bleating ""I can't do this without you!"" over swelling violins).

But Tim Roth deserves some credit for actually making Rainier a somewhat three-dimensional character -- a man oppressed by his duty and France's empire-making agenda. You actually feel very sorry for this man's struggles, and I really wished we would focus more on the political intrigue and the remaking of a nation... than on Grace floating around smiling at the commonfolk.

""Grace of Monaco"" fails by making its center a contrived, silly drama about a former actress learning how to wear pretty clothes and smile, instead of the more interesting international drama. It seems more like an attempt to show Grace as a fairytale princess than as a human being.",1421625600,35,4631,4.993514915693904
5949932,5,B00EXPOB5S,"Nicole Kidman stars in this beautiful inspiring film about Grace Kelly's transition to Princess Grace Of Monoco.  The film is stunning hi-def on blu ray, is in it's correct aspect ratio and plays on U.S. blu ray players. It is a British import (no problem at all playing on U.S. players, no difference at all)  and can be found at Amazon.co.uk for around $25.  The blu ray includes a 50+ minute interview with the real Princess Grace that is not in high definition but is a welcome extra.  Filled with political intrigue and based on the true history of Monoco in the early 60s, I highly recommend it.",1420502400,7,601,4.537037037037037
5949933,5,B00EXPOB5S,"If you are waiting for a pure biography in this movie - than this is not but if you are looking for a great entertainment
and a fairytale that is certain to make many critics mad but make a legions of females around the world to be glued
to the tv till the very last moment than -  this is it.

I tend to dismiss entirely movie critics recently as they tend to find a hole where it is and where is not and frankly
can ruin any movie experience and if I followed their advices I would never see half of the absolutely fab chick movies
that kept me warm through a many cold weekend nights.

Similarly as with the movie Diana that is a movie that all girls I know watched infinite number of times, this movie
is a keeper and something I will be coming back to watch over and over again. It is a story of a women that
is living a fairytale and we all are curious about those real-life fairytales however they are told.
If it could be told better then may somebody try! but for now this is the best story of Princess Grace
and I am not going to be neat picking.

Nicole Kidman is absolutely stunning and she totally and believably conveys  the golden cage syndrome
with her absolutely fantastic facial expression down to the every muscle and at some point here and there her read convincing eyes
that look like she was just crying but has to put a happy face on to show and do her princess things but we all can
see that is not as pink and pretty as one could imagine.

She is fabulously capturing that dual reality of a woman...  ""an every woman"" that is trapped in the world she might
have choose but when she was choosing it she did not realize what was to come and now it is just way too complicated
to just close the door behind.. She is showing with the mastery of the World's -best actress the very emotions
so many modern wife's are in and perhaps she was in and she can simply act it out the way it is believable.

She is as beautiful and as graceful as ever. Fabulous acting and just full illusion of the person.
When I was watching her, very quickly I forgot that it was Nicole Kidman on the screen and I was simply
looking at Grace Kelly.

The glamour, the charm, the beauty.. it is all there.. visually stunning, nicely paced action that
gives a viewer time to reflect and is not about just action like so many modern movies that kill
the moment by ending it too soon.

I am not sure why this movie has not been released in the states yet. I am glad I bought the DVD
and saw it, I hear that the UK and French versions are different from the US version and I
am dying to see the USA version to be able to compare. I am sure that there is tons of
politics around movie making and distribution and all that and the movie criticism as such
is part of that machine so it is great that nowadays  one can just get a movie on DVD and Blu-ray
and watch it regardless of the whole politics and that public opinion making machine
and one can exercise one's own right to the opinion and watch it regardless of
someone telling you what you should and what you should not.

The only painful thing is the price that one pays for watching this earlier then everyone
else in the USA but that was also a kick to do it that way.",1418342400,26,3217,4.121405750798722

5949953,5,B00EXPOB5S,"When news of this film was fresh in the media I was intrigued. I love Grace Kelly aka Princess Grace of Monaco. However, after all the delays and drama surrounding its production and ultimate release on LifeTime TV I decided to say ""pass"" So, imagine my surprise when I was totally engrossed in every minute of this lush, superb film.

Nicole Kidman is extraordinary as Grace--or, as close to extraordinary as one could get trying to emulate the one of a kind Kelly. The film spans only a short but important time frame in the life of the Grimaldi Family but it is a good move. We see, although allegedly fictionalized how the young Princess was instrumental in saving Monaco from unscrupulous actions from the French government and within the Prince own family.

What emerges is a love story that is poignant and heartfelt. The setting is majestic, the clothes and art direction glossy and fantasy-like. When the film concludes in a long monologue on stage at the Red Cross Ball all eyes are upon ""Grace of Monaco"" and, I was genuinely surprised and impressed. How sad this tim didn't get a chance too make the big Oscar release and push to which it not only hoped for--but was deserving of.",1484784000,,1192,4.644549763033176

5949969,4,B00EXPOB5S,"I was curious as to why it received low ratings. I actually liked it. It was different and real. It showed the side of Grace's life that was kept hidden. You only read and saw pic of her glamorous and fairy tale wedding, happy family pictures, etc. This film showed the battle Grace fought, what marriage truly means, and how to be strong even when a country is threatening to invade. Grace remained true to herself and used it as her strength. She also adapted and sacrificed everything to be the Princess for the people.
This film was well done and I truly enjoyed it even though it was quite depressing and I usually can't stand sad movies but  it showed me a side of life that usually is kept hidden; it captured the unglamorous side of life; the harshness, and vulnerable side of Grace many don't know as they only see her as the beautiful, stunning actress with poise.",1477872000,,874,4.4625

5949984,5,B00EXPOB5S,"Nicole Kidman embodies Grace Kelly in a manner that once again sets Nicole in the arena of great actresses like Vanessa Redgrave or, more currently, Jennifer Lawrence.

This part of Grace Kelly's life was the turning point in her marriage. After this, no more Hollywood aspirations and security for her became almost Nazi-like. A tragic story. I wish Nicole Kidman could have done Grace's last years. Tragic, but her film career was no tragedy. She was a great actress, and when she married Rainier I remember people being incredibly upset over it, and very relieved when Grace decided, tentatively, to make the film ""Marnie.""

Notice the speech she gives at the Red Cross Ball at the end of the film..the hesitations, the self-assertions, the nervousness, the sense that she will be judged over and over for what Rainier once stated were her bad ideas about everything. Nicole is giving us clear signals as to what lies ahead.

Don't miss this one.

Grace Kelly captured the imaginations and adoring stares of fans around the world when she was an actress in Hollywood. The go to girl for director Alfred Hitchcock its hard to believe she only starred in just 30 films. But Kelly gave up her career for a real crown when she married Prince Rainier of Monaco and move to that country.

GRACE OF MONACO deals with the changes Kelly faced when she arrived rather than her life prior. Focusing on her trying to decide if she should have a career and be the wife of the Prince or if she should be there for him and serving beside him to care for her newly adopted country is the focus of this film. It takes place during hard times for Monaco as France is forcing increasing demands on the country which is still considers itself owner of.

The movie has a sort of pinball feel to it, bouncing from one subject to the next and then back again. First we watch as Kelly must learn just what her place in Monacos society is, what is expected of her, how she should behave. Then we find her trying to decide if she should return to acting or not. Bam, were watching the rulers of Monaco battle about what they should do about France. Then Kelly is brought into the mix by the end of the film, a tribute to the real Grace Kelly but one that leaves you wondering how much truth there is in what is portrayed.

Nicole Kidman stars as Kelly with a performance that one assumes was lost on the cutting room floor. Kidman is a skilled actress and scenes in this film work marvelously. But the way they are edited together makes it seem to be helter skelter rather than a straight on performance. Tim Roth feels wasted here and more one note than Ive seen him before giving no life to Rainier. This feels no way the fault of Roth but more of the script and directing involved.

With the source material available it would seem like the story of Grace Kelly would be ripe for a biographical movie to be made. TV movies have been done but not theatrical releases that Im aware of. But while this film is promoted as her story it almost feels like the movie was built around her but focusing instead on the political machinations of the country as well as France, a slight of hand promising one thing and delivering another.

The pacing is slow, the editing jumbled and the look a poor tribute to the time the film takes place in. Truth be told more than one time I found myself beginning to doze and had to back up the disc to see what I had missed. Even after doing so it didn't feel like I missed that much. Perhaps this movie would be good for a rental to be watched early on and not near bedtime.

5950063,1,B00EXPOB5S,"I couldn't get myself to purchase a copy of 'Grace of Monaco'. Why am I reviewing you ask? I watched the premiere on Lifetime some time ago. I blogged about the film right after watching and decided to share my review with Amazon as a sort of warning before purchasing.

The film was a French-American Biography about, former, Hollywood star and Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly. Nicole Kidman portrayed Grace decently, although it was painful watching her attempt to show emotions with that botox injected face of hers. Unfortunately, I have to admit the film was filled with untrue accounts of what actually went down.

Here is what bothered me the most:

Marnie: It was true that Alfred Hitchcock bought the rights to Marnie so he could convince Grace Kelly to return to Hollywood to play the lead, but the film portrays Prince Rainier as being completely against Grace making Marnie. In real life, Rainier actually encouraged her to take the role. He was very supportive of Grace making the movie because he knew how much she loved being an actress. He was excited to rent a house on location in the U.S. and make it a family summer vacation. He thought he could play golf and enjoy himself away from all his cares in Monaco. Grace said it wasn't exactly going to be a vacation for her, with the early morning call times and long hours on the set, but she was happy at the thought of returning to her craft, and thrilled that Rainier was interested in joining her with the children. The film seemed to exaggerate Rainier's attitude and it seemed producers wanted us to think they were unhappy to be with each other and didn't quite get along.

Grace Agreeing To Feature In 'Marnie' Leaks To The Press: One of the major plot points in the movie was that the Palace of Monaco press release was leaked to the media before it was officially announced, which was not true. The Palace actually released an official announcement stating Princess Grace would be making a motion picture with Alfred Hitchcock during her summer vacation. They also detailed the amount of money offered for the role and expressed her interest in donating it to charity.

Speeding Off In Her Car?: The film showed Grace speeding off in her car, nearly hitting someone walking on the road. In real life, Grace didn't like driving and when she did drive she was known to be a slow and careful driver.

The Film Was Fictional: The film begins with the statement- ""The following film is a fictional account inspired by real events"". However, the film then opens with black and white stock footage of Grace Kelly's arrival in Monaco for her wedding to Prince Rainier. This newsreel footage immediately gave me the impression that the film is historic.

Overthrow Attempt Actually Happen 7 Years Before The Crisis With France: A major plot point of the film centers around an attempted overthrow by Prince Rainier's older sister, Princess Antoinette, and her husband, Jean-Charles Rey. While it was true Princess Antoinette had planned an attempt to depose Prince Rainier in order to put her 6-year-old son, Christian, on the throne, these events happened in 1955 - seven years before the 1962 crisis with France during which the events in the film take place.

Although the film was inaccurate it wasn't a complete disappointment. Nicole Kidman did a pretty decent job portraying Grace Kelly. There isn't much of a resemblance between the two but in some shots I found myself noticing a few similarities. I have to honestly say I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. It could have been a lot better. I'm giving it a 2/5 stars (simply based on Nicole Kidman's portrayal and the supporting cast members).",1452470400,4,3673,4.773228346456693

5950065,2,B00EXPOB5S,"You know you're in trouble when a film gets more press about its dramatic production problems than the story it tells.

Grace of Monaco was directed by renowned La Vie en Rose helmer Olivier Dahan. It's lush, rich in detail, and teeming with extra players. It's the kind of film that's made with a view to the Academy Awards.

At least that was the expectation from filmmakers and fans alike. In reality, it's a dreadful mess, badly written, and badly produced, so much so, it crashed like a burning zeppelin at Cannes. There was booing, there were catcalls, there were tears..

The film tells a story both awfully familiar and totally strange: It's 1962, six years after Kelly wed Rainier III, Prince of Monaco (Tim Roth). She's borne him two children, yet she's unhappy, lonely, and considering an offer from her old friend Alfred Hitchcock to return to Hollywood to star in one of his pictures, Marnie, in a role that eventually went to Hitchcock's latest obsession, Tippi Hedren.

The story plays out against a political crisis: France threatens to annex its protectorate, Monaco, the tiny principality ruled by Rainier and Grace.

While still in pre-production, the film drew criticism from Kelly's son, Prince Albert, who denounced it as historically inaccurate fantasy. It continued to make headlines when a feud broke out over the film's tone between studio chief Harvey Weinstein on one side and director Dahan and producer Pierre-Ange Le Pogam on the other. Weinstein reportedly wanted a light tone, and the filmmakers were intent on producing a serious morality tale.

Eventually Weinstein pulled it from theatrical distribution. In swooped basic cable channel Lifetime which acquired it one imagines for a song.

The resulting film is a mess. Driven by a weak, facile screenplay, the film is singularly shallow in both intellectual and emotional content. Its structure is a mess: Fragmented and episodic, it simply doesn't cohere.

Kidman seemed a natural choice to play Kelly. She manages to soar in several scenes. Hampered by the subpar material, she seems utterly lost, unable to master what could have been the role of her career.",1450656000,2,2147,5.045197740112994

The acting was very unnatural, the characters were empty shells of themselves, the script overbearing and melodramatic. And the dialogue! Kidman was beautiful, of course, and the ball scenes were beautifully costumed. But other than that, there was no romance (I don't remember either Prince Rainier or Tim Roth being so unnatractive as they were made to be in this movie) no element of fantasy, none of the ""glow"" that attached itself to Princess Grace and her life. Kidman did too much staring into the camera for my taste, and there were far too many close-ups that went on forever. The last thing I want from a movie like this is a political speech (basically 60's peace and love) from a plastic woman who is supposed to be breathtaking in looks as well as personality but isn't. The looks may have been there, but there was so much more to the magic and fairy tale of Princess Grace and absolutely none of that came through in this film. Everything about this film was unnatural, and considering how much has been said and written and filmed of Grace Kelley, one has to wonder why this underwhelming Kidman-fest needed to be made.",1450051200,2,1226,4.706976744186046

I knew nothing about the real story of Grace Kelly and what happened after she left Hollywood so Im not sure how much of this is accurate so I cant speak to that. Much like the Diana movie with Naomi Watts the movie is good but nothing amazing and not one of the best biopics ever made. The best part of the film is Kidmans performance.

5950070,4,B00EXPOB5S,"Most are familiar with the story of Grace Kelly, the American Academy Award winning actress who married the Prince of Monaco. If the newspaper accounts at the time are to be believed, they lived happily ever after, a story-book ending for the fairy-princess.

According to Grace of Monaco, all was not well in story-book land.

In was 1961 and there was plenty of drama and palace intrigue behind the glitter and glitz of royal life.

Grace Kelly, conflicted and dissatisfied with royal life, wanted to return making pictures, at least to star in Marnie, a role Alfred Hitchcock offered to her. Grace believed Ranier did not appreciate her.  This may have been true. Ranier was preoccupied with his neighbor, France. France was fighting a war in Algeria and pressured Monaco, a small dot of a principality on the Mediterranean, to impose an income tax on its subjects and forward the revenues to France.  Or else. Or else France would invade, take over Monaco and depose Prince Ranier. If this  weren't enough, it was discovered that the sister of Prince Ranier was betraying him by being a spy for France.

A quote allegedly from Grace Kelly herself at the beginning of the movie summed it up: The story of the fairy tale princess is itself a fairy tale.

The main performances are strong in this picture. Tim Roth plays Prince Ranier, regal, of course, but with a hair-trigger temper. In one scene a French diplomat was slurring Grace Kelly and Roth/Ranier cracked him across the face. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Kelly, who plays the role with appropriate ...  um,  ... grace.

Some of the supporting characters are throw-aways. Frank Langella, who is ordinarily a fine actor, has a weak role in this movie, and yes, Im afraid to say that Derek Jacobis role was wasted. But the performances and events they describe are enough to bear repeated viewing.",1442361600,7,1853,4.813880126182966

GRACE OF MONACO is set 1962, six years after the Wedding of the Century, and gives an intimate look into the life of Princess Grace Kelly. Nothing is more important than family. And Grace proved it in how she left Hollywood and took on the most important role of her life: as monarch of a small principality, the wife of Prince Ranier III, (aptly portrayed by Tim Roth) and mother of heirs to Monaco's throne. Grace is lovingly portrayed by Nicole Kidman as in one magical night--she charmed the world and outwitted the French President Charles de Gaulle whose aspiration was to overthrow Monaco. Grace remained at Rainier's side, supporting him, and made Monaco her home. If it is Grace that said:  'love is much more than a passion, but an obligation' then she proved it to us all.

5950073,1,B00EXPOB5S,"Those who are experts on all things ""Grace Kelly"" and ""Princess Grace"" will be as appalled as I am at how many little things and big things they got wrong in this movie and why on earth wouldn't Nicole Kidman study her subject at all before taking on this role?

Grace Kelly didn't smoke, she didn't call Rainier ""Ray,"" she didn't study palace protocol SIX years into her marriage, she knew how to dance [just watch ""The Swan""] she didn't fight with her husband in public nor tell DeGaulle where to get off.  She was not a good driver and would have never driven 100 miles an hour as she does in the movie when she was upset.

She was offered the role of ""Marnie by Alfred Hitchcock and because Rainier in his own words said that ""the Princess seems melancholic at times"" finally agreed that she could do the role which was a departure for him because he had made her turn down every previous role she had been offered.  It seems somewhat of a cruel joke by Hitchcock to offer Grace Kelly [who had previously starred in his ""Dial M For Murder"", ""Rear Window"" and ""To Catch a Thief] a role in which she plays a frigid thief raped by her own husband.  Tippi Hedren eventually ruined the role with Sean Connery as her co-star.  I don't know how they would have changed that script if Kelly had played Marnie but I can't imagine how it would have remained the same.

But I digress.  Nicole Kidman doesn't even try to capture Kelly's accent  and her beauty doesn't begin to compare to that of Kelly's but there are scenes [it looks as though she is shot through a gauze filter possibly because Kidman is 15 years older than the woman she is portraying] where the camera does catch a resemblance which is rather amazing since the two women look nothing alike.  Kidman is probably the best thing about the movie which isn't saying a lot but at least she tries although she always looks like she's about to burst into tears.

Tim Roth plays Rainier [no resemblance to the Prince] and he seems to be in a major sulk throughout the whole movie and his role consists primarily of him sitting and smoking.  And sulking.

We all know by now that Grace Kelly was not a happy Princess [""The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale""] and this movie delves into that with dialogue that just guesses at what Grace might have said to Father Tucker of all people.  Another mistake in the movie.  Father Tucker was Rainier's confidante and by all accounts, Grace never confided in him.

So the movie juxtaposes Grace's decision to do Marnie while at the same time Rainier is fighting with DeGaulle over taxation in Monaco.  The two did occur simultaneously but by all accounts, it was the Monagasque's appalled reaction to their Princess being in a movie which was the reason Grace eventually declined the role.  ""Do you want to see your President [JFK] kissing another woman on the screen"" was the average reaction.

Then the movie takes an even more ludicrous turn by having Grace discover that Rainier's sister Antoinette is working hand in glove with DeGaulle to oust Rainier from the throne and assume it herself.  Not only did that never happen [talk about artistic license] but the laws of Monaco wouldn't have allowed Antoinette to take the thrown which is why Princess Caroline abdicated for Prince Albert who now rules the House of Grimaldi.  The law allowing women to ascend to the thrown has only recently changed.

Everyone got into a fight with everyone else over the final cut of this movie but frankly, no matter how you cut it, this movie bears no relation to the truth and it's just plain terrible.",1434585600,12,3610,4.530046224961479

5950102,4,B00EXPOB5S,"At the end of 1961, Alfred Hitchcock (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) comes to Monaco seeking an audience with the Princess or ""Gracie"" (Nicole Kidman). He came to present her with his latest script for the role of ""Marnie"" along with a lofty offer of one million dollars for her to play the lead against this new ""Scottish fellow"" (Sean Connery, although not mentioned in the film by name) he has in mind. Problems arise for the Altesse or Princess of Monaco as she has been Her Serene Highness for six years now. She has the duties of her station and along with Prince Rainier III (Tim Roth), she has their two young children Albert and Caroline to think of. It is quite obvious to Grace Kelly, one of America's leading actresses who left to marry and take the Title of Princess of Monaco, along with many other Titles, that she has to decide if she is all in or split between her duties of State and her acting desires. She becomes more lonely while Rainier is always busy trying to save Monaco, without a standing Army, from a political takeover. She still feels her love of the acting which she left behind. Rainier told her that he would not stand in her way although it is clear from his expression and posturing that she belongs where she is; by his side and with their children.

While Princess Grace still considers herself as just a ""Girl from Philidelphia"" her advisor and friend, Father Francis Tucker, ""Tuck"", (Frank Langella) constantly reminds her of her duties and her station. His advice is what she leans on so desperately. 'Hitch' is constantly on her mind as she has always been his favorite. Rainier needs her there to aid against the takeover and taxation of Monaco by Charles de Gaulle of France, The Red Cross needs her charitable aid, she needs to represent the Principality with dignity and her children just cannot be left behind. The Princess is stuck in a dilemma which causes her to make the decision to shape up and be the Altesse that she has committed to. This is not a position that one can take on while being only lukewarm in her constitution. It is time for Grace to put away that Philadelphia girl and step into her role as Her Serene Highness, The Princess Grace of Monaco.

The movie, directed by Olivier Dahan from the screenplay of Amash Arel, puts together a great supporting cast which includes the drab and understated assistant, Madge (Parker Posey), Phyllis (Flora Nicholson), who serves as Grace's great friend, confidante, and Rainier's sister, Maria Callas (Paz Vega), Andr Penvern (Charles de Gaulle), and Aristotle Onassis (Robert Lindsay) among other performances in this tale covering the happenings in the year of 1962. Princess Grace must visit Count Fernando D'Aillieres (Sir Derek Jacobi) to learn the protocol and etiquette of being the perfect Altesse after she makes her decision to not ""be a failure"" in her royal undertaking. The walking, talking, breathing, positioning, dancing, posturing and correct French pronunciation that she hasn't seemed to completely master in the years that she has been the Princess she now receives from him and two other coaches.  Why hadn't she completely owned  this the entire time? Was Grace Kelly not taking the royal position she had married into as seriously as she could have been, especially while raising the heir to the throne? Although, I really liked the film, this more modern-day fairy tale intrigued me since learning about it so many years ago and viewing her three movies with Hitchcock, my favorite being ""Rear Window"" with Jimmy Stewart, but I digress. I can understand how she could be torn between her acting days where she was adored in America and comfortable there and her life now as Princess of Monaco. This is Nicole Kidman's movie, she wears it quite well. Tim Roth is more than one dimensional and at times, confused over how to speak to his wife while asking for advice from Tuck also.

The film shows Rainier's vulnerability in the marriage although not with Monaco's interests but mainly this movie shows off Grace's one political venture with an ovation ending for her influence. All of the costumes, formal occasions, period dress and the royalty were wonderful to view - Particularly for a romantic such as I. I think that many of us get quite curious about the story of a real-life 'Princess' and in this case she was Hollywood's darling at the time of her marriage. I both enjoyed her acting as Grace Kelly and equally enjoyed her taking the position of Her Serene Highness of Monaco. All of what that entails and Nicole Kidman choosing to do this part as Grace elevated the storyline for me. I had not read any reviews previous to viewing and I found this movie quite good while others simply did not. For me, it was a sumptuous visual feast much more than being biographically or historically accurate, I simply enjoyed the film for what it was; entertaining.
