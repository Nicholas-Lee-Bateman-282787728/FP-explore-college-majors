The Cohen brothers are probably still wishing they had done this one. We'll be looking forward to more from Travis Milloy.",1264636800,,261,4.931818181818182
8629670,5,B0001DCYNM,"This movie is indeed in my top 3 best movies ever made. The acting is superb, the action and comedy is non-stop grabbing. The only part that threw me off was the random shot of two kids on bikes near the end of the film, was there a reason for this shot? I think there names were Rusty and Ryan, great actors with potential. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",1104278400,3,358,3.9178082191780823
8629671,5,B0001DCYNM,Don't miss this one. This movie should have been a blockbuster!  Very intense with great story line. This movie deserves a sequel.,968025600,2,130,4.909090909090909
