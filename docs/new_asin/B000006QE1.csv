It might seem stunning that with no qualifications in physics and opposed by almost all active physicists, Marconi could introduce the world to wireless communication and eventually win a Nobel Prize in Physics!  Actually, this pattern of big breakthroughs triggered by unqualified people repeats itself so often in human history, we need to do better in recognizing it and exploiting its power.",1388188800,,511,5.375
7904608,4,B000006QE1,"Today we take for granted the pictures on our televisions, the music we hear from our radioes and the information we receive over our wireless phones and computers. We are able to enjoy these miracles of technology because of one man; Guglielmo Marconi, the Father of Wireless.
  Biography delves into the life of this man who was determined to be the master of the airwaves. Uneducated by our standards, this driven man defied the scientific skeptics of his day and challenged the monopoly of the cable companies. He succeeded in conquering one and staying in constant battle with the other.
  Guglielmo Marconi was an obsessed man and was determined to succeed. In his myopic quest for his dream he paid a heavy price in his personal life but opened the vast doors of communication to the world. In viewing this film you see Marconi's world unfolded through interviews with his daughter, a grandson and one of his workers. Old film clips show you the failures and triumphs of him bringing his new technology into the 20th Centuring. You see a man disparaged by his father, indulged by his mother and later praised by the world.
  A remarkable life such is this shows how determination and a clear focus can drive one to the top. It also shows the misguided foibles of the man who ended up destroying his family and succumbing to facist politics merely to gain glory. This enjoyable film will unfold for you a great pioneer in physics to whom we owe a great debt.",991094400,2,1464,4.6770428015564205
