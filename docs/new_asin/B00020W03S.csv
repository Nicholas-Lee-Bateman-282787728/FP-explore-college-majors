8180354,3,B00020W03S,"Bloody Territories is not really a classic or a brilliant Yakuza film but is nevertheless interesting and a good watch for those interested in the little known Yakuza genre and fans of Kinji Fuksaku's entertaining Yakuza Papers series. The films opens in a gripping manner, due to heavy and ongoing police and public pressure the coalition of different Yakuza bosses agree to disband and ditch their territories and Yakuza titles and therein entering a business status. Although one group decides to hold on to the territory and stay Yakuzas but now that they are the only group left they are vulnerable, weak and an easy target for a much bigger, outside and powerful Yakuza group to move in. While Kinji Fukasaku concentrated more on the bosses of the world and gang wars this film concentrates the small underlings, thugs and enforcers who protect and order their territory: beating up troublemakers or outside gang members, getting protection money and wandering around bored. The main character is Yuji played by Nikkatsu regular Akira Kobayashi (the only Nikkatsu actor that really matched Jo Shishido for star power) whose heavy loyalty to his group never changes even when threatened by death, him and his gang members must fight against a much more stronger force. Bloody Territories paints a bleak picture for the old Yakuza: slowly dying out are all Yakuza bosses and noble Yakuza Godfathers and in are the Yakuza under the guise of businessmen and encroaching on territories without mercy. While Yuji's gang wear the Yakuza status on their arms and stroll around, the new Yakuza walk in smart suits and ties but are still the same. Regular Nikatsu director Yasuharu Hasebe (most known for his cheap and crappy exploitation films Nikkatsu made in the 70s) handles the film capably but his direction is uninspired and dull with the exception of some nicely-handled action pieces. The plot itself is interesting but not gripping like The Yakuza Papers which had an episodic plot but nevertheless had fast-paced action and intrigue while Bloody Territories' plot stalls at times and drags a bit but overall is a good ride but no Yakuza classic. The DVD company could have released one of Yasaharu Hasbe's better Yakuza films such as the gripping Retaliation (1968) or Roughneck (1968) which are superior to Bloody Territories and more superior in terms of plot and characters.",1359158400,3,2384,5.053299492385787
