8053799,5,B0007Y4SRK,"I own about 80 judo books and about 30 DVDs, and am always on the lookout for that ""holy grail"" of books or DVDs that brings it all together, or which addresses concepts that go above and beyond the same old stuff you see in all the other DVDs and books (you know...how to fall, how to do static uchikomi with a compliant, unyielding ""zombie"" like partner, how to do this or that throw).  Most DVDs either just show you an assortment of ""the latest"" throws or feed you different combinations that are theoretically supposed to be that ""magic bullet"" that makes you better.  THIS DVD IS DIFFERENT, however, because it explores areas that I have for some time been trying to work on--kuzushi, action-reaction, feints, etc.  Although he does cover some combinations, the thrust of this DVD is techniques and tactics to use on probably an experienced, aware, prepared, skilled opponent--who is not just going to stand there like a sack of flour and let you hoist him up and to the ground.  Like I said, for a while I've suspected that the key to getting better at judo (for me) is to experiment / explore kuzushi concepts and timing, entry, footwork, etc.--but above all, how to create kuzushi (off balancing).  I had been experimenting with great success during practice with implementing a quick, sharp push in conjunction with a step in towards my opponent and IMMEDIATELY pulling and spinning for a throw....or the opposite: pulling as if to do a throw, using my head movement and body to ""feint"" a throw (e.g., harai goshi) but IMMEDIATELY reversing my pull to a PUSH while setting the support foot and driving into the opponent to perform a backwards throw (e.g., kouchi gari).  THIS DVD IS THE FIRST I'VE EVER SEEN THAT THOROUGHLY EXPLORES THESE CONCEPTS and goes way, way beyond what little bit I've described here--for example, instead of just teaching a predictable ""push, pull + throw"" or ""pull, push + throw"" component of generating kuzushi, this DVD goes into hanging your weight or pulling DOWNWARDS and then UPWARDS as a way to offbalance, etc.  Other DVDs do not explore these concepts.  Again, other DVDs only give you the basics--how to do the throw (yawn), or how to link (mechanically) combinations together--as if this will somehow guarantee success in a tournament (it will not--mechanically  ""aping"" someone else's combinations--while a worthy goal--should not be the first step; the first step should be to learn timing, how to generate off-balancing, how to confuse the opponent, and THEN learn how to link combos).  THIS DVD explores action-reaction, feints, hand movements / tugging etc. to ""confuse"" or shock the opponent for a split second, doing the unexpected, etc.  There is a wealth of good information on this DVD.  I have his ""combinations"" DVD too, which is also very good.  But if I were to do it all over again (started in judo 5 years ago) I would have concentrated on learning 2 throws (a forwards and a backwards throw) and spent a lot of time learning how to feint and disrupt my opponent's balance and timing, and how to get my opponent to move in a certain direction--all the stuff on this DVD.  Is it perfect?  No (the french accent is sometimes indecipherable), but it definitely is worth it.",1330473600,4,3234,4.801801801801802
8053800,1,B0007Y4SRK,"I had to give this item at least one star in order to post this review.  One star is too much because I have never even seen this DVD.  It is advertised that the DVD will work in the US and Canada, this is a lie.  Even the package the DVD arrived in states it will work in all DVD zones...  Another lie.  I tried to play this DVD in three different DVD players and got error messages that the DVD was not formatted for the particular zone I'm in.  Yep, and of course I can't return this because it is no longer ""unopened or in original condition""...  I spent $29.95 plus $2.98 for shipping and handling for a grand total of $32.93! I would have had more fun throwing my money into the wind because at least somebody could find it and spend it as opposed to me being stuck with something I can't even sell on E-Bay.",1174867200,4,814,4.081761006289308
8053801,4,B0007Y4SRK,"The DVDs are in French and English, controls select easily.  Much of this is the state of the art as it was before grip fighting.

As a warning, I bought this as part of the three DVD set. I have a combined TV DVD player, a Sony DVD drive/DVD player in two of my computers and a brand-new multi-spectrum Panasonic player.

The DVD would not play on any of them. I have found this quite frustrating as I would very much like to see the material. I should note that the other DVDs in the set do not play either on them either. The website was not been terribly useful in obtaining help.

However, the fourth computer I obtained since I received the DVDs two years ago for Christmas suddenly recognizes and plays them and I can give them four stars now.

A little dated, but there is a lot of material, presented with good camera angles and precision, in combination with clear steps.  This video even has some grip fighting and other advanced for the times material.",1171756800,2,964,4.387640449438202
