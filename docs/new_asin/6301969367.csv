388629,3,6301969367,"The Marx Brothers entered their last decade as a team with ""Go West"", which pales along some of their earlier films but still has some great moments.  In the hilarious opening scene, Chico and Harpo bilk Groucho out of his fare money at a train station, and then Groucho walks off naturally thinking that he has the upper hand.  Film sags somewhat in the middle, redeemed by some funny bits in a saloon.  The last third of the movie has a wonderful climax aboard a train, where the boys' incompetence causes havoc but of course they get the bad guys in the end.  A fun little movie, one of their better 1940's efforts.",1000425600,8,618,4.442477876106195
388630,4,6301969367,"After a declining and dissapointing change of At the Circus, their first work at MGM, the Marx Brothers seem to get back on the right truck in Go West in many ways.  On the top sequence, Chico and Harpo trap Groucho at the train station: the two get the ticket to ride (as a result of Chico's skillful yell, ""Nine dollars change, please!"") and go to the west, while Groucho goes broke.  Compared to At the Circus, laughing spots are more successfully and equally placed over the whole plot.
Also, in spite of the setting of the story, in the late 19th century, the Brothers highlight themselves with individual musical performances:  Chico with his unique ""shooting keys"" of piano at the bar, Harpo with incredibly perfect harp playing at the native American's village (*Harpo actually transforms a mysterious outdoor object with strings into a harp!), and Groucho with backing vocals in two songs (*not his complete solo performance, but still good enough).  Your 80 minutes will fly much faster than you expect if you watch this Go West!",984268800,6,1039,4.820224719101123
388631,3,6301969367,"The Marx Brother's ""Go West"" does have some hilarious moments, but unfortunately there's not enough. It starts out great but goes downhill, occasionally having some very funny moments throughout. ""Go West"" is pretty weak about half the time, but it's worth seeing just for those moments of gold.",977788800,4,295,5.166666666666667
388632,5,6301969367,"This is one of my favorite Marx brothers films.  I can't see how Leonard Malt-ed say it was a disappointment.  If you want to be disappointed, see At The Circus or The Big Store.  This is a great flick with tons of Marx style bits from the get go. It opens with the awesome ""9 dollars change"" bit to the big train finale, scripted by Buster Keaton himself!!! Dont miss it!!!!! TIM-BER!!!!!!!",974764800,6,391,4.402777777777778

388634,3,6301969367,"""Go West"" (1940) is easily the best of the Marxes' final three MGM releases. Unlike ""At the Circus"" and ""The Big Store,"" the brothers were able to test some of their material in front of live  audiences. This is evident during the classic opening sequence in which  Harpo and Chico fleece Groucho  rather than the other way around. ""Go West"" also features one of the Marxes'  most memorable climaxes as they tear down a running train in order to fuel it. Otherwise, the film is a hit-or-miss affair, with some terrific Harpo  routines and a few regrettable scenes in which Groucho's stature is  painfully diminished.  It's a pity that the screenwriters did not have a  better understanding of the Marxes' comedic personas.",933638400,6,722,4.860655737704918

388687,3,6301969367,"As a long time Marx fan,, I avoided many later films on their negative critical reputation. Seeing this now was a happy surprise, with many delightful moments. No it's not Duck Soup, but it is so nice to be in their company again!",1349481600,,230,4.372093023255814
388688,4,6301969367,"Go West was surprisingly funny; I expected a much slower plot bogged down with corny songs. Yes, there are one or two brief musical numbers that no doubt were placed into this film because MGM loved to turn out a musical; and these one or two numbers do slow things down a little. However, make no mistake about it: There are plenty of gags in the flick that are sure to make you laugh; you'll watch every moment of it!

The action starts at a train station when S. Quentin Quale (Groucho Marx) is trying to raise a little money to go west to seek his fortune. There's a very funny routine Quale does with Joe Panello (Chico Marx) and his brother Rusty (Harpo Marx); and somehow all three manage to eventually go west. By a chance meeting Joe and Rusty loan an old man some money and as ""security"" for the loan they get a deed to Dead Man's Gulch. What none of the men realize yet is that Dead Man's Gulch is actually precious land because it is wanted by a wealthy railroad company. The railroad wants Dead Man's Gulch at almost any price to make a huge and profitable rail line from New York all the way out west.

Quale soon hitches a ride further west on the very same stage coach that Joe and Rusty are on; and from here on in the plot becomes even more hilarious. Quale, Joe and Rusty wind up in the town where the railroad company wants to buy the deed to Dead Man's Gulch; and look for some zany plot twists as the deed passes back and forth amongst several men.

There's a weak subplot about two younger people from feuding families falling in love--if the railroad deal can go through; but the comedy scenes with some Native Americans are embarrassingly dated. Ouch!

Will Dead Man's Gulch finally be safely in the hands of people who want to build a railroad and do good deeds--or will the crooks 'Red' Baxter (Robert Barrat) and Beecher (Walter Woolf King) beat them to it to milk the railroad company for way more than the land is worth? Will the young couple marry? How will Quale, Joe and Rusty get the deed back to New York? No spoilers here folks; but the train ride near the end of the movie is an elaborate and wonderful climax that lasts a good fifteen minutes or so. You'll enjoy the gags!

I personally give this film four stars; I must take off one star for a couple of musical numbers that should have been canned and the dated scenes with Native Americans. However, Go West still remains one of the better and stronger Marx films. It's also one of their later films (1941).

I highly recommend for diehard Marx Brothers fans; and this film is one to watch even for the more casual fans of the Marx Brothers style of classic comedy.",1197244800,2,2656,4.355555555555555
388689,4,6301969367,"It was with fairly low expectations that I popped ""Go West"" into my DVD player this evening. After all, as Marx Bros. purists repeat ad nauseam, the Brothers' later pictures generally failed to live up to the high standards set by their earlier Paramount-era films. That may be so, but I found ""Go West"" to be hilarious all the same. Which is hardly surprising since nobody does mayhem like the Marx Bros.! As always, Groucho has lots of great one-liners, Chico plays a charming con-man, and Harpo gets up to all kinds of anarchic antics.

Encountering Groucho for the first time in the train station, Chico asks where the train is. Groucho replies, ""It's out on the tracks; it seldom comes in here."" In previous films, the Brothers' made fun of the circus and the opera; in this film, they play havoc with the conventions of the Old West. On observing a fatal shooting outside a saloon, Chico tells Harpo: ""I don't like-a the West: all the people do is kill each other. I'd like-a the West better if it was in the East.""

In contrast to some of their other films, especially ""At the Circus,"" the musical numbers are delightful and catchy. That goes not only for the solos by Chico and Harpo, but also for the duets sung by the star-crossed lovers. This latter feature of the MGM films was often tedious and forgettable; happily, that is not the case in ""Go West."" I thoroughly enjoy this film and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the madcap humour of the Marx Bros. The climactic train sequence alone makes the film a must-see.",1152921600,5,1540,4.596363636363637
388690,4,6301969367,"The Marx Brothers' GO WEST (1940) shares its title with a Buster Keaton film from 1925.  And both films start with a caption card containing Horace Greeley's famous quotation: ""Go west, young man, go west.""  This wouldn't be the only moment in the film when I was reminded of Buster Keaton.  The goofy train sequence at the movie's conclusion seems to be at least inspired by some of The Great Stone Face's exploits.  Of course, one major positive in Keaton's favor was that his movie didn't have any singing in it.  But the most important similarity between the two films is that I liked them both.
GO WEST is a definite improvement on their previous two films, the average AT THE CIRCUS and the unfortunate ROOM SERVICE.  The writing (in particular the one-liners) seems much sharper and wittier.  The sequence of Chico and Harpo fleecing Groucho at the train station seems reminiscent of the more famous ""Tootsie Frootsie ice cream"" scene in A DAY AT THE RACES, but manages to draw laughs without simply recycling the same gags.  Somewhat surprisingly (given that this is set in the Wild West), there isn't too much parodying of Western standard set pieces (apart from one or two gags).  This is a Marx Brothers film that just happens to be set in the Wild West, rather than one specifically making fun of Westerns.
As for the plot that all these jokes are existing in...  Well, I don't think of myself as particularly slow, but this is the first time I've ever had trouble following the storyline of a Marx Brothers film.  The overall story is fairly simple (a railroad company wants to buy a piece of real estate for a stupid amount of money), yet the particulars eluded me.  I just couldn't keep track of the specifics of the bad guys' plan.
Now, the reason I had trouble keeping track of the plot is actually a good one for a Marx Brothers film.  There isn't enough time devoted to the storyline for it to actually make much sense.  This, of course, isn't a bad thing, because the worst part of the Brothers' films (apart from many of the musical interludes that didn't feature Groucho, Harpo or Chico) was the endless romantic subplots.  Fortunately, there's a relatively small amount of screen time that goes into non-Marx scenes, which is bad for figuring out what's going on, but great for anyone who is looking for entertainment and jokes (which, really, should be everyone).
I found GO WEST to be a very pleasant and welcome surprise.  The reputation of their later MGM pictures is shaky to say the least, but this is a lot of fun.  The gags are clever and funny, while the songs from the fake-Zeppo and the female romantic lead aren't intrusive (indeed Groucho's backing vocals on one of them is surprisingly good).  This is definitely a highlight from the Marx Brothers' later movie career.",1086912000,5,2805,4.678207739307536
388691,4,6301969367,"""Go West"" is a guilty pleasure of mine. Being a big fan of The Marx Brothers, I am always ashamed whilst talking to fellow film buffs when I say that one of my favorite Marx Brothers films is 1940's Go West. And while it's not Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, or A Night at the Opera, it is still a highly enjoyable film, partly due to my love for western films. Some good gags in this one, including the hilarious pick-pocketing scene in the begining and the wild chase on the top of a train at the climax. Overall, if you are a fan of classic comedies or the Marx Brothers, you won't want to miss this. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun.",1069200000,8,645,4.168
388692,4,6301969367,"If you expect to see the reason why the Marx brothers are considered one of the greatest comedy acts of all time this is not the movie for you.
If you want to see a funny movie with great sight gags, a bunch of fine one liners and some great physical humor then you will enjoy this picture.
Sometimes the problem with making so many great movies over so many years is that you always expect perfection.  Oscar is a funnier movie than this, but this is a funny movie.  You will laugh and smile and that's the reason to watch a comedy isn't it?",1056931200,5,542,4.152380952380953
388693,2,6301969367,"I write this review with a sense of guilt.  The Marx Brothers have, over the years, provided the world with some of the best cinematic comedy moments ever.  To me there is no question that they are the greatest comic group of all time.  I read much about their career and I noticed that their later movies were made, according to Groucho, to help pay off Chico's gambling debts.  I had, on tape, a couple of their older movies that I was saving for a rainy day.  Well, when it rains it pours and my day was ruined watching the brothers stumble and fall trying to save this hopeless picture.  The comedy routines are drawn out too long and the timing seems to be off.  However, the main problem is that the writing is bad.  There is only so much that even the best can do with jokes that aren't funny.  There is a routine with some Indians that bombed particularly bad.  The story line itself (never a major part of any Marx Brothers movie) makes no sense.  The movie ends in a race between a train and the bad guys in a carriage.  I could never tell why there was a race on in the first place.  I was in the right frame of mind to laugh but I never got anything to laugh at.  If you must watch one of their final movies, save your money and get ""At the Circus"".",1046131200,5,1261,4.135802469135802

What it is, is a very well made, nicely produced, beautifully photographed, excellent tribute chronicling America's western expansion. It is expertly hosted and narrated by Dale Robertson. Ken Curtis as Festus is added for comic relief, although I personally fail to see the need for a sidekick to Dale Robertson, who is more than capable of holding his own in any production! Nevertheless, it is always good to see that side of Ken Curtis. Regrettably, he doesn't use that magnificent singing voice of his. However, various well-know (Glenn Campbell, Johnny Cash, Riders in the Sky, Eddie Dean), and some not-so-well-known music artists and groups give a nice array of classic western tunes throughout for added pleasure. Shot in many famous locations throughout the West, the scenery is breathtaking. The only thing I can't understand is why this is a German production made for German television,. Certainly, such a uniquely American subject and project could have been produced just as well right here in the good 'ol U.S. of A. Perhaps, not. Regardless, I have thoroughly enjoyed this presentation and feel it well worth purchasing, not only for the historical value, but for the music, if nothing else.",1513468800,,1295,5.084507042253521
