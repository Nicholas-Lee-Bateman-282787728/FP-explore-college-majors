159246,5,0793984297,"I have been a fan of Mel Brooks for a while, all this time considering Young Frankenstein as his all time best...now I have to rethink that! I discovered this movie a couple months ago, and now in my book it rates up there with Young Frankenstein as the best Mel Brooks movie out there. Why doesn't it get the publicity of his other films? It is a classic! The performances in the movie are great, I couldn't stop laughing! I wish that Mel Brooks would also make a movie of The Golden Calf, the sequel to this story.",1002844800,13,516,4.222222222222222
159247,5,0793984297,"This is the best Mel Brooks' film ever, and I've seen 'em all!  Okay, I'm a Russian Revolution buff.  If you're not, you might miss the Lenin, Engels, Trotsky Street (with Trotsky's name crossed out) in the background of one of the scenes.
If the opening scene doesn't get you, nothing will.  A once-aristocratic old lady on her deathbed confesses to her son-in-law (now a lowly clerk in the U.S.S.R.'s muddled bureaucracy) that she sewed her jewels into one of their chairs before fleeing the Revolution.  The son-in-law forgives her for not telling him before, and leaves a ""cancelled"" stamp on her face before she dies.  Priceless stuff!
The difference between this and many other Mel Brooks' films is that it's an intelligent laugh at stupidity, whereas most of his films are stupid laughs at stupidity.  Don't get me wrong!  I can appreciate both, but this is by far better.",996883200,5,879,4.82
159248,4,0793984297,"You have to see this overlooked Mel Brooks comedy for one reason: Dom DeLuise's performance as the priest gone totally crazed with avarice.  He is simply hysterical.  I think the scene where he has gone to Siberia and finally hounded the chairs from the couple, only to come up empty, and begins his inept suicidal impulses is priceless.

There are other great moments in the film, a cameo by Brooks as the drunken Tikon, and nice performances from Ron Moody & Frank Langella.

The film is a dark comedy, not as light and fun as Blazing Saddles et al, and there is more exposition than usual, which tends to make the film's pace slower.

 However, the real problem with the film, which prevents it from being a classic, is that there is a cruel streak in the relationship between Langella & Moody that can be uncomfortable at times.

Nonetheless, there are some great bits in this that make it well worth a look.  I would rate it 3-1/2 stars if it were possible, but 4 will have to do.  Dom makes it all worthwhile.",985910400,37,1015,4.4728260869565215
159249,5,0793984297,"This masterpiece of cinema is based on the novel ""The 12 Chairs"" by Ilf and Petrov, two brilliant russian writers that managed to publish very refined political satire work during the post bolshevic-revolution era in communist Russia; thus this has nothing to do with any ""old rusian tells"" whatsoevr.  Another masteriece by Ilf and Petrov is ""Tha Golden Calf"" which actually is in sequal with ""The 12 Chairs"".  The finess and accuracy of outhr's sense of observation coupled with their excuisite writng talent was briliantly carried over by the genious of Mel Brooks that created not only a splendid movie, but also an historic document.",977097600,9,638,5.066666666666666
159250,5,0793984297,"If you liked Blazing Saddles and The Producers, I know you must like this one, no matter what anyone says.

159251,5,0793984297,"If you think Mel Brooks is only good for broad, obvious humor (Robin Hood- Men in Tights, or History of the World) or sharp parody, (Young Frankenstein) then you owe yourself a look at this movie. Made after The  Producers, this is Brooks's first attempt at combining serious and comic  elements. The film is NOT a laugh fest, nor is it meant to be.  Brooks  deals with character over comedy in the two main characters, creating an  interesting  (and often touching) relationship between the two, leading to  a final shot in the film that is emotionally pure and effective. Dom  Deluise provides wonderful comic relief as the priest who is also after the  chairs, and Brooks himself makes a short cameo as the former servant to Ron  Moody.  Carl Reiner has said that to him, the funniest man on the  planet is Mel Brooks.  That's pretty high praise, but after seeing this  movie, my bet is you'll come away with a deeper appreciation for Brooks's  talent, and you might just wonder why he didn't make a few more films like  this one.",957312000,47,1033,4.593406593406593
159252,2,0793984297,"The one reason I would tell someone not to rent this film or buy it is because there's not enough laughs! If you can believe that! Especially from MEL BROOKS! The story gets a bit BORING after a while. But this is not  Brooks' fault! This movie is based on a old Russian novel entitled  ""The Golden Calf"". There are some good points to the film though.  This is Brooks' best directing effort. He shows great control has a  director. The acting is SUPERB! Brooks even transforms Hugarian dance #5 by  Brams,calling it ""Hope for the best....expect the worst!"" The  title itself should bring on a smile. To bad there wasn't enough laughs!",947030400,,635,4.575221238938053
159253,2,0793984297,"Mel Brooks is probably my all-time favorite actor and director, but he really let me down on this movie.  First of all, he doesn't appear in it.  Secondly, okay, they are a few funny parts, but not many.  If you want to  see something funny, try his OTHER movies: Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs,  Men in Tights, History of the World Part 1, Blazing Saddles, etc.  Watch  this movie if you have nothing better to do and you've seen all of his  other movies.",939945600,2,456,4.475609756097561

159284,3,0793984297,"Claudia Ivanovna has lived a long life. Now she is on her deathbed in their poor little house, when once she lived in a big fancy house. But that was before her family escaped a Russian pogrom by running a away with not a minute to spare. She tells Ippolit Vorobyaninov, her son-in-law, a secret: ""Do you remember our dining room suite? In the house in Stargorod. Before the revolution... My jewels, my diamonds. I sewed them into one of the chairs.""

That's diamonds worth at least 150,000 rubles today. Ippolit returns to Stargorod to see if he can find the one chair among twelve that has the diamonds. But he's not the only one searching.

This movie, which came out in 1970, was Mel Brook's 2nd movie, after ""The Producers"" (1968). There are jokes, but they are scarce. It gets a little repetitious, as Ippolit finds one chair after another and tears the fabric trying to find the jewels. My thought is that it would have worked better in a shorter treatment, ""The Twelve Chairs"" is okay = 3 stars for me.

Mel Brooks directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one of them. Eight of his movies, including ""The Twelve Chairs"" are collected in a slipcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks-Bx-Sm-Cb/dp/B000EBIONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks Bx Sm Cb</a>.

There were plenty of funny bits and even the plot-line itself is funny - a former aristocrat and a young con artist teaming up together, traveling all over Russia looking for 12 Chairs, one of which is filled with priceless jewels, but they don't know which one! And if that weren't enough, there's also a Russian priest turned treasure hunter who's just as determined as they are! What more could you ask for?

These two novels are classic literature in Russia and the funny timeless quotes from those books are embedded in Russian language and culture.

Mel Brooks is trying to stuff the 540 pages of the novel in to 93 minutes of film and loses a lot of flavor on the way. 90% of the humor is lost along with a great deal of the story line. It is like doing Lord of the Rings in a 90 minutes low budget film. That being said, this is still a funny film to enjoy with a family. Perhaps before watching this film you should actually read the book. It is much more funnier then the movie. The move can give you the visuals but does not care the essence of the novel.

The movie itself had a chance to be very good. The acting is great, the actors are awesome, Mel Brooks did capture the turning points of the novel, but failed to deliver it's best parts and a lot of the novel did not make it to the script at all. The marriage scene for instance or the bit where Ostap asks the Father Fyodor: ""So, Reverent Father, how much is your Opium for the Masses?"" or the bit where Ostap asks the boy ""Perhaps you also want the key from the apartment where money are?"" When those lines are delivered in context they are priceless, but in the case of the movie those scenes do not even exist. The bit where Ostap convinces former aristocracy of a town that Vorobjaninov is a Father of Russian Democracy and takes their donations to the non existent democratic party to further his hunt of the treasure. Etc etc etc.

Nice try. But Funny flick if you did not read the novel you might like it. But you are missing out on so much more. If you want to have a taste of what it was like in the early Soviet Union and lough out loud in the process, forget the move - get the book.",1342396800,8,2500,4.9170616113744074

I have seen it and that's what's important.  I'd say Mel Brooks got all he could from the original Russian story, and from the actors.  I'd watch the movie again just to see Ron Moody's scene as a stage actor.  And to see Frank Langella so early in his career, there's no indication of Richard Nixon in his future.  Maybe Dracula.  And yet, this film refuses to drift away from my recent memory as simply another film.  I suspect at sometime, somewhere, someone will bring up this Brooks film, and I'll mention I have a copy.

159445,4,0793984297,"""The Twelve Chairs"" is a curious choice for Mel Brooks' second directorial feature film. After the manic & controversial ""The Producers"", Brooks tells the story (sort of) of an old Russian folk tale about a woman revealing to a humble clerk (Ron Moody, walking the fine line between pathos & hysteria in this one) on her deathbed that the family fortune of jewels has been sewn into one of the dining room chairs. The catch: Since the Russian regime has turned into the Soviet Union, that dining room set has been scattered across the country. The plot thickens when a tall, dark & handsome young opportunist (Frank Langella) learns of the secret & forces the clerk into a partnership to find the chairs. Dom DeLuise--wonderfully funny, as usual--is a priest who becomes a direct rival in finding the fortune.
Brooks obviously had a soft spot for this old story, which doesn't go in for wild sight gags or profanity; it's humor rests on the modest simplicity of life in the Old Country. But this is a comedy, and Brooks sprinkles touches of the trademark slapstick & skill with funny dialogue everywhere. After an exhaustive race to find the fortune, the film concludes with an inevitable lesson: Life is full of disappointments; just be happy you're alive (guess I kind of spoiled the ending!). Chronologically sandwiched between the joyous hysteria of ""The Producers"" & the uproarious satire of ""Blazing Saddles"", ""The Twelve Chairs"" is a more modest but sweet & amusing little gem.",1257292800,3,1484,4.892857142857143

The only positive comment I can make is that Ron Moody does a pretty fair job in his role as the disgustingly selfish one-time nobleman.

There is a stereotype that Hollywood is dominated by leftist political beliefs.  I have seen plenty of evidence in its celebration of revolutionary causes and its attacks on American patriotism, traditional morality and religious faith.  But I have never viewed such a brainless affirmation of Communist Russia as this film.  The film is based on a Soviet Russian story and is faithful as a Stalinist film director would have been in its rendition.  A former nobleman and a priest are the leads, and both are portrayed as greedy, stupid and corrupt.  Their twisted characters are the premise of the movie.  Mel Brooks appears to have read his Lenin and Stalin with childlike approval.

I couldn't give that to my brother for his birthday, or he'd think it was used (even though it was shrink-wrapped, OVER the inky mess). So I opened it up, took out the front cover paper and CD, and put them in a new case.

159473,3,0793984297,"""Twelve Chairs"" is perhaps Mel Brooks least known film, although it's much better than most of his post-1970s movies.  Ron Moody (""Oliver"") stars as a former Russian nobleman whose mother-in-law on her death bed confesses to having sewn the family jewels into one of the 12 chairs of their dining room suite right before the Russian Revolution.  Unfortunately, she also told her scheming priest (Dom DeLuise), and the two quickly race off to find the dining room chairs and recover the jewels.  Along the way, Moody is forced to become partners with a young beggerman (a very young looking Frank Langella).  Mel makes a rather funny cameo as Tikon, the former assistant to Mood's character.

Although ""Twelve Chairs"" is a bit obscure, it's actually based on a very well-known and oft-filmed Soviet satirical novel by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov.  The premise is terrific, and Brooks does a good job keeping the plot interesting and the pace going.  The movie also benefits tremendously from being filmed in Eastern Europe (the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), which gives it a unique look for a comedy.  Overall, it's an interesting movie.  Unfortunately, it's simply not as funny as Brooks' best films.  Yes, there are some funny scenes, but the movie fails to sustain the humor for long; nevertheless, I did enjoy the movie.  Fans of Brook's 1970s movies will likely appreciate ""Twelve Chairs,"" and there's probably enough here to keep most others entertained.",1224979200,2,1479,5.070247933884297

I love this film because one gets an early glimpse into Mel's love of puns and parody, as well as the excellent casting and performances of Frank Langella, Ron Moody, and Dom DeLuise.  It's a hilarious romp through the newly post-revolution Soviet Union where these three men are all hot on the trail for a fortune in priceless jewels hidden in one of twelve chairs left behind in a noble family's mansion after being forced out by Bolsheviks.  Dom is superb as a greedy and crooked priest who abuses the sanctity of the confessional.  This film is a must-see for die-hard Mel fans.  His song that opens the credits, ""Hope for the Best (Expect the Worst)"" is brilliant, sad, and beautiful and sets the tone for the movie marvelously.",1223596800,3,855,4.75

The humor bounced between understated to the point of boredom, mild satire, and slapstick which frequently stumbled past funny to merely manic.

On the plus side, Dom Delouise produced some good laughs as the greedy priest. Mel Brooks was funny as Tikon the ex-servant who fawns over his old master.  Also a young Frank Langella looks great for the ladies.

159499,5,0793984297,"I've been a Mel Brooks fan for many years, and count ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" as two of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but I was unaware of ""The Twelve Chairs"" until the recent release of Brooks' box-set.  My local library happened to have the video, so I picked it up out of curiosity, only to discover a real gem!  As a precursor to the all-out wackiness of a few years later, and following the genius of ""The Producers"" before it, ""The Twelve Chairs"" is laugh-out-loud funny without the bodily functions humor and broad slapstick that would soon follow.  How fun to see a (comparatively) thin Dom DeLuise as Father Fyodor; his scenes are some of the funniest in the movie (""Oh, Lord....you're so STRICT!!""), and Mel Brooks himself makes a really hilarious cameo appearance early on.  But the real surprise of the movie, indeed nothing short of a revelation, is Frank Langella.  Though he had been making a name for himself as a stage actor for most of the 1960s, this was his very first movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" was also released in 1970, but he filmed ""The Twelve Chairs"" first), and at 30 years old, he is impossibly, achingly, stunningly, devastatingly gorgeous.  As he would soon do in ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"", and nine years later in ""Dracula"", every moment he is onscreen, you cannot take your eyes from him and he wipes every other character off the map.  Back in those days, he exuded complete and utter sensuality in a way that few actors have ever come close to achieving, and in this movie it is in full and luscious flower.  And yet, even apart from that, his performance itself is outstanding, running the gamut from coldly opportunistic, to cruel, to crafty, to playful (there's a wonderful scene between Frank and Ron Moody early on, when Frank tries to get Ron to tell him what is hidden in the chairs, that reveals a real gift for comedy), and ultimately even to kindness (the very last scene is a wonderful, real, emotional moment).  It's a fully realized and nuanced performance, and a preview of the stellar actor he was on the way to becoming.  A wonderful movie, a delight on many levels, and highly recommended!",1147564800,18,2172,4.662303664921466
159500,4,0793984297,"Seeing the films Mel Brooks has directed in recent years, it is hard to understand where he lost his muse.  His early works are full of genius and uniformly well-cast.  The Producers, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein are all classics today.  The Twelve Chairs should be, for it rates with those other three as a film of comic genius.

The plot is set in the 1920's USSR and does a masterful job of skewering the Soviet system while capturing the flavor of Russia.  Ron Moody is a deposed nobleman whose dying mother tells him that she hid the family jewels in a set of dining room chairs.  As Moody hunts them down, he inadvertently teams up with drifter and opportunist Frank Langella.  The villain is Father Fyodor (Dom deLuise), an Orthodox priest who hears about the wealth in mama's deathbed confession, and then cuts off his whiskers and joins the scavenger hunt.

Moody is great in the madcap role he plays as former Marshal Vorobyaninov.  His legs-all-akimbo, owlish countenance is ideal.  Langella's character is a pathologically mendacious delight.  Dom deLuise overacts a bit and is somewhat intrusive.  Mel Brooks himself has a modest cameo as Tikhon, the Marshal's old servant, waxing nostalgic for the good ole days when he could enjoy being slapped around by the nobility.

There's sometimes touchingly artistic cinematography, good pacing, and a neat soundtrack combining everything from the Internationale to the Brooks-written title song ""Hope for the Best.""

If the film has a flaw, it's that towards the end it gets a bit too serious and loses the madcap edge that the jerkily-fast-photographed chase scenes gave it early on.  But that's the only star off the top for this gem.

But my top three Mel Brooks movies are THE PRODUCERS, THE TWELVE CHAIRS, and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Although he does have a few minutes on film in this movie, they're brief and effective. But he never comes close to stealing the scene from Ron Moody, Frank Langella or Dom DeLuise--and all three of these actors are perfect in their roles. DeLuise is at his best here, and Moody, with his Trotsky looks and high strung personality is hysterical. THE TWELVE CHAIRS is brilliant historical spoof of strong materialism in a place where no one is to have possessions: post-Revolutionary Russia. But humans will be humans, and the desire for comfort and money will always be with us, I'm afraid.

It's a welcome change of pace from films Brooks made in between these two which relied a lot on slapstick and sexual humor. In fact, it's okay for kids to watch, as there is no swearing, nudity, violence or sexual situations (which shows you what a filmmaker can do without going for the cheap laughs).
