The acting is great, the story is excellent (though you don't know for a while that it actually has an excellent plot-line).  When you get to the end, you realize that this is much more than a taboo, erotica-seeming premise. That is just one secondary element.  I was definitely, pleasantly surprised.

Highly recommend for Prime Instant Video audience.",1427673600,15,415,5.029411764705882

The entire film is full of romantic gestures.

The explanation in the Italian language of what a drifter is, is very poetic, and I wish you could understood the subtle lyric in it.

5160836,3,B008GZVHNK,"Meh. There's a good bit going on in this movie, but very little of it is really all that interesting. We learn the protagonist lusts after his half-sister, who for some odd reason is living in his flat in the days (weeks? How much time is passing is a bit vague) leading up to their parent's wedding. For some reason she doesn't want to leave and so spends all day lounging around in her underpants doing who knows what. It's important to note that the two don't know each other that well, so this is not some story about brother and sister taking their natural familial bond to the next, taboo level. There's some underlying statement about ""drifters"", i.e. people who defy classification (at least, in the structure of their handwriting) that I suppose is supposed to tie the whole thing together but it didn't quite work for me. At any rate, well acted and well directed, but just not all that memorable or interesting.",1440720000,,922,4.593939393939394

5160851,3,B008GZVHNK,"I never write reviews but just had to do my first and only one. I really liked this film but I could give it more than 3 stars due to a few reasons. Be warned, spoilers ahead. Also, if you are against incest or find it not in your tastes, avoid the film. Aside from that, I HIGHLY recommend this film if you are looking for that type of genre. Here's my actual 1 statement of the film if you want to avoid my spoilers. All in all, I would have preferred if this film showed love/relationship development with Mete and his sister from the beginning to the end and not adding in fillers which contribute to nothing in this film.

*SPOILER ALERT* There wasn't too much development between the main male protagonist and his sister and in end, he just sleeps with his sister (finally). That part was pretty amazing (erotic as well, but it felt sensual like he and his sister were really in love), but there just wasn't any development that would lead up to this ""love"" despite that being the synopsis of the movie. Another issue I had with was Mete's job. There wasn't any relation with his job and his coworker/friend Bruno in regards to the relationship with his sister. It basically wasn't something the director needed to focus on.
*END OF SPOILER*

Just have to throw this out there but Miriam Giovanelli is an amazing actress and of course, she is very sexy. A shame that she isn't in any American films or popular European films. She's one of those diamond is the rough actresses and I hope she makes it to the top in the future.",1435276800,5,1531,4.406360424028269

5160907,3,B008GZVHNK,"It's an odd movie that deals with a tough subject: a brother/sister infatuation. I don't know what to say about the topic, but as a viewer I can say that the movie was done with taste. No overtones, or gratuitous sexual encounters (although something does happen); there is actually a parallel story that underlines the main character frustrations with his family and probably precondition his mind to the unspeakable act. The main character development until the climax seems well thought thru; after that, oh well ... I dunno what to say. The sister's, on the other hand, appears as an after thought. She is so irrelevant (except for the fantasies that she incite into the brother's head) that I dare to say the movie could have been made even without her character present. Overall it is an okay movie, certainly not among the best Italian movies ever made, as someone had suggested.",1429401600,,886,4.8355263157894735

5160921,3,B008GZVHNK,The plot was confusing with the incestuous brother brooding through the entire movie.  Not a typical Italian family movie.  You will miss Fellini movies...,1428969600,,155,5.416666666666667
