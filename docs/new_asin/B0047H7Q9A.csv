4285187,5,B0047H7Q9A,"Very entertaining!  Mainly about leopards but other deadly animals are thrown into the mix as well IE hyenas, lions, chimps, baboons, crocodiles - all of which are enemies of the leopard.  This makes for an array of action-packed, dangerous, life-threatening encounters.

Information/facts about leopards is plentiful.  Inside look on how one particular female leopard lives and survives in the wild with her two cubs.

Narrator can sound a bit cheesy at times but not a big deal.

Overall an awesome animal documentary, highly recommended 5/5 stars!!",1344384000,,551,5.348837209302325
4285188,5,B0047H7Q9A,"This was a great video!  It plays out like a movie.  In this particular movie, you follow the life of a mother leopardess as she raises and teaches her cubs.  Your dished a fair amount of information as the story progresses.  The narration isn't bad.  Overall, it's thrilling!

4285189,5,B0047H7Q9A,"Revealing The Leopard is too short, and could be a little longer, it does not reveal that much about leopards that we don't already know. It is a good documentary but is only 60 minutes long. It takes more than 60 minutes to reveal, discover, and learn about this very secretive feline.

I would still highly recommend Revealing The Leopard, for brief educational purposes. Any footage of leopards is still very entertaining, but the short duration leaves much to be desired. It seems that as soon as you really get into the documentary, the closing credits are already rolling.",1315353600,6,578,4.838383838383838
4285190,5,B0047H7Q9A,"A great video with magnificent images and footage. I don't think anyone would be dissapointed, this is among the best quality wildlife DVD. Top dvd for leopard footage!

I became a leopard lover after watching this.

Also highly reccomended: NATGEO's Eye of the Leopard",1313193600,5,269,5.090909090909091

8418144,5,B0047H7Q9A,Totally worth it. This documentary is awesome! You'll learn some interesting facts about Leopards if you haven't already like for instance: did you know that the worldwide population of Leopards outnumbers the population of other big cats!? In this short but concise film you'll see how a Leopard evades Lions and humans and understand just how they are soo many in number but at the same time soo hardly ever seen! And you'll also get a glipse of the black Leopard!,1387065600,3,466,4.765432098765432
8418145,3,B0047H7Q9A,"I was very excited to get this video because I enjoy watching big cats. However, it is made up of Big Cat Diary film clips that can be seen for free if you record them on Animal Planet.  The clips are of different leopards but the narrative misleads the audience as though it is the story of one leopard family.  There are very good clips included but I would recommend the BBC's Big Cat Diary which originally filmed the African scenes and have many of those same clips available.  This video would be better suited for children or someone who will not notice that the footage is spliced and diced.",1374710400,4,599,4.427272727272728

8418147,5,B0047H7Q9A,Saw this Nature special on PBS about a year ago. It was well done and worth buying. Eye of the Leopard is another great documentary.,1368835200,,132,4.32
8418148,5,B0047H7Q9A,"Stunning day and night photography, with infrared scopes at night, of the leopard.

How were the filmmakers so close to these secretive and private animals?

This film showcases the leopards' strength, their beauty, and their vulnerability.",1368576000,2,240,5.638888888888889
8418149,5,B0047H7Q9A,"I watched this video originally on PBS Nature and I was glued to my seat!  I went on an emotional roller coaster and knew immediately that I had to buy this.  Everyone that comes over my house, I tell them to watch this because this is one of the best Nature segments I have watch and the first one that I've ever purchased.  It really gives the viewer an up close view of leopards and now I'm fascinated with them.",1361318400,,415,4.1625
