8225076,5,B000WPNNKC,"Coming from Bas Rutten's workout, this workout was a great challenge.  It requires you to work at your own pace, so no matter your level of fitness, you will be challenged.  With 20 years of martial arts experience, I have found The Pit to be a perfect workout series for anyone wanting to get fit.",1249516800,,298,4.4
8225077,4,B000WPNNKC,Received my order in a couple of days.  I would highly recommend this dvd set for anyone that wants an intense workout. Thanks JOHN HACKLEMAN !!,1235433600,2,144,4.538461538461538
8225078,5,B000WPNNKC,"I had already ""mastered"" the Bas Rutten MMA Workout, being able to do all the 3 minute All Around Fighting rounds-on a heavy bag-with wrist weights, but The Pit Workouts hits you differently.  Where as Bas' workout is CD only and generally wears you out with one basic exercise, The Pit has lots of variety.  It focuses on one part of your body, wears it out, then makes you punch or kick with fatigued limbs.
Be advised, the Upper Body workout has a section on kicking and the Lower Body workout has a part on punching.  I actually like this so I can rest up those limbs for the last burn out drill.
Hackleman does much of the major exercises himself, like pushups and squats on the Upper/Lower Body disc, but he mostly just instructs for the Cross Pit exercises.  He talks a lot which is a godsend if you're tired, but annoying if you're in a hurry.  Of course, that's why they invented the fast forward button.
Here's a rundown of the set:
PIT WORKOUT
Disc One:  You're expected to have a bag and jump rope for the first disc, though you can shadow box and jump ""invisible rope"" if you don't
Upper Body Workout ~72 minutes (The second 5 minute burpee drill is highly unnecessary, my biggest complaint about the whole thing)
  Lower Body Workout ~52 minutes
Disc Two:  You don't need any equipment for this one
All Around Workout ~52 minutes (the Black Jacks are too fast!)
Feature on Handwrapping
Feature on Stretching
Bonus Material (some workout strategies, some fun outtakes)

CROSS PIT WORKOUT
(just one disc)
Cross Pit #1 ~32 minutes (includes marathon pushup/squat/rowing sessions)
Cross Pit #2 ~32 minutes (includes sit ups and pull ups or exercise band pulls)

PIT INSTRUCTIONAL
(one disc)
Features Hackleman, Chuck Lidell and Glover Texeira.  Includes lots of small segments on-for example-the jab, straight kicks, roundhouse kicks, basic ground positions and strategies.  Good introduction for beginners and good refinement for intermediate MMA practitioners.  I don't know if advanced guys would find it helpful 'cos I'm not there yet.

On a side note, I had one scratched disc, and contacted MMA Roots (dot) com directly.  They sent me a new one, no questions asked.  They are good people.  If you're into MMA or just punishing workouts, I highly recommend this boxset.  It may seem pricey, but it's cheaper than one decent pair of shoes.  If you use it every week, it is definitely worth it.",1224633600,13,2407,4.768115942028985
8225079,5,B000WPNNKC,"This workout is tough! Alot of pushups, squats, squat thrusts, and bag workout make this one hell of a workout. The first 2 disc's are ""the Pit workout"" upper body, lower body and total body (with the world famous Pit blackjacks) workouts. The next disc is the ""Crosspit"" workout, Johns own version of Crossfit. Both workouts are not for the faint of heart but he does tell you to ""go at your own pace"". You will see results in a couple of weeks. John Hackleman pushes your muscles beyond pain and then he puts you on the bag to finish the fight. This box set is the best workout box set I have ever bought. As John says: ""This aint Tae bo, this is the PIT!""",1204848000,5,658,4.23015873015873
