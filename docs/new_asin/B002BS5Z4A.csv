8361856,5,B002BS5Z4A,This is an all over teaching of the basics of the Ascend Tribal Format from the ground up.  Just like taking a class or a workshop and much more!  This is the best bang for my buck I've gotten from any instructional DVD.  Make sure to watch the interview portion its what keeps me sticking to it.  If you like Gothic Fusion or Tribal Style Belly Dance then you will love this DVD.,1355184000,,380,4.164383561643835
8361857,3,B002BS5Z4A,"I am disappointed to have paid full-price for this DVD.  I expected better.  On the plus side, the section of ""Signature Combinations"" is very good ... but I wish I had purchased this cheap/used.

To her credit, Sashi breaks-down all movements clearly.  The set is one of the best I've seen in a bellydance DVD.  But there is NO MUSIC!!!  The whole DVD is TALK TALK TALK.

The talking format is fine for a 1-time work-shop where students learn about body mechanics and artistic concepts (indeed the DVD is very good on that score) ... but *I* buy dance DVDs for daily practice ... and I can't imagine standing through the lengthy explanations day after day.

I liked some of the movement names as evocative of mood and aesthetic ... but I also think she went over-board.  ""The raven"" is an original move and no other name exists ... but WHY call a rond de jamb ""circle caster"" or call 5th position ""invocation arms""?  Learning new names for standard moves just confuses me.

All-in-all this DVD is great as a 1-time workshop to learn movement mechanics and understand the artistic vision and aesthetics of Sashi's style.  The combinations are very good, too.

As a daily practice, it sucks.  No music, no drills.  I would recommend buying if you can find used/cheaper.  If you want a DVD for drills and practice - get Ariellah's.  This DVD seems oriented for artistic study - not daily practice.",1262131200,21,1395,4.651639344262295
8361858,4,B002BS5Z4A,"I've tried many tribal fusion training video and I can tell you that this is my favourite one.  I love the way she explain the mooves, she is a great teacher.  She can tells you every part of your body that should work for every kind of moove she explain.  I've tried Rachel Brice, Sharon Kihara and Zoe Jakes's DVd and I can tell you that I think she teaches mooves better than they can do (These absolutely wonderfull dancers dance very well, but we can see that teaching is not maybe better than someone who do more teaching and is following the same group of students).  She have great combinations and signatures mooves to practice too.  The only part I think was missing a little bit is his yoga stretches, dynamic stretch are excellent, but I think it's not enough.  That's why I suggest you to follow the stretches from Sharon's DVD but keep doing Sashi's dynamic stretch before doing the yoga part.  She is my inspiration for everyday life, I had the pretty same problems than her when I was a teenager and, as she say in her interview, whenever your physical condition is, if you whant to reach something and you give your best you'll have the results you wish and deserves.",1260057600,,1184,4.47906976744186
8361859,5,B002BS5Z4A,"This is a well rounded DVD - conditioning, drills, and chorrepgraphy. I am also very inspired by Sashi's personal story. Sashi's personality shies through on this DVD. Do not hesitate - BUY IT!",1253836800,2,193,4.878787878787879
8361860,5,B002BS5Z4A,"The warm-up is just as challenging as her workshops, so maybe try it half speed to her first few times, especially if you have an injury!  The talking in tonguings and introduction to the ascend format is thorough and fun taking each move and putting it to music straight away.  The combos are all broken down nicely and used in the performance.  Her performance is captivating, both the director and artists cuts having their pros and cons in how they're filmed and her interview was insightful and a real testament to 'bellydance is for everyone'.  Well organised, delivered and beautifully presented.  You'll be hearing 'knees-bent, hips-tucked, shoulders-rolled, chest-lifted, looking-hot' in your sleep!",1249516800,7,708,5.285714285714286
8361861,5,B002BS5Z4A,"I bought this dvd after seeing Sashi perform on a few Gothic bellydance dvds, and I'm so glad that I did.  Her breakdowns and cues are fantastic, and the way that she names the moves makes them really easy to remember.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to work on their tribal fusion moves.",1249171200,8,302,4.375
8361862,5,B002BS5Z4A,"Uno de los mejores DVD's q hay en el mercado para adentrarse en la fusion de gothic bellydance. Sashi tiene un estilo unico q se muestra en su tecnica, cabe mencionar q ademas de ser una excelente bailarina es mi instructora favorita, he tenido la oportunidad de asistir a cursos con ella y realmente se preocupa por cada uno de sus alumnos.

Este dvd realmente me ha ayudado bastante  ya q practico con el, el mayor tiempo posible, te ayuda a tener una mejor postura, a realizar movimientos limpios, una respiracion adecuada y sobre todo aprendes la tecnica de ascend tribaldance de forma divertida.
