4120487,5,B003FXXNH6,"It's rare that a DTV movie can impress as completely as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>&nbsp;did. Aside from being the best film Isaac Florentine had directed, it was arguably the single best martial arts flick released that year. The fact that it was filmed for under $10 million and managed to attain cult status without a theatrical release makes it even more impressive. Florentine followed this masterpiece up with the questionable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shepherd-Border-Patrol/dp/B0011VIO46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shepherd: Border Patrol</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja/dp/B002XTBE5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja</a>, both of which were a decisive step back from the quality he had pioneered for the low budget market. Thus, it was with some apprehension that I awaited the release of ""Redemption,"" fearing it wouldn't do the original justice...but I am happy to report that Florentine is back on par and delivers what is decisively the best straight karate flick of the year. Is it as good as its predecessor? Let's see...

The story: after his defeat by George Chambers, former prison fighting champion Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins) is left unable to fight with a debilitating knee injury, but his warrior's spirit doesn't die. Rehabilitating himself, he earns both the renewed esteem of the warden (Mark Ivanir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>) and entry to an international prison tournament where the prize is freedom. However, when the conditions are manipulated to favor an unstoppable Colombian powerhouse (Marko Zaror,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiltro/dp/B00127RAK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiltro</a>), he must accept an alliance from an American boxer (Mykel Jenkins, ""The Bold and the Beautiful"") if he hopes to taste freedom again.

Boyka is back to fighting within 10 minutes of the movie. At first, I was disappointed that it seemed the entire rehabilitation angle was fudged, but in fact his injured knee remains a focus throughout the film. It never really heals, and you know that at any moment it could give way or an opponent could catch on and take advantage. It's a good plot point in the story of Boyka's redemption - redemption I don't believe he truly attains, considering his deeds of the last movie, but it's interesting to see him become more of a human being than he was the first time around. Of course, this is made easier for him by Marko Zaror's apt portrayal of his darker half. Like Boyka, Dolor the Colombian is religious, and even spends time reading the works of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Federico-Garcia-Lorca/dp/0811216225/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Federico Garcia Lorca</a>, but he's attained his physical greatness through drugs and his sadism knows fewer limits than even the old Boyka's. He makes a great villain, but the real bad guys are still the prison wardens, headed by veteran actor Vernon Dotcheff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Name-of-the-Rose/dp/B0001Z37IG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Name of the Rose</a>), who have dark plans for everybody but Dolor. It's an old ploy to arouse sympathy for unsympathetic characters (the fighters), but an effective one.

Speaking of fighters, ""Redemption"" showcases plenty of excellent up-and-coming talent. In this field, it surpasses its prequel since that one only featured two real standout fighters - Adkins and Michael Jai White - while ""Redemption"" has four or five, depending on your standards. Adkins and Zaror are rightfully making names for themselves as solo stars but I was just as pleased by the casting of lesser-known athletes like Ilram Choi and Lateef Crowder. Mykel Jenkins isn't a martial artist but has a great build and convinces you of his proficiency in boxing. Fresh from a lackluster outing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellbinders/dp/B0038M5VTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellbinders</a>, Esteban Cueto makes a decent brawler but only has a couple matches in the beginning of the film. There are plenty of better fights to see than his - fights so good that picking the best one is a real challenge, as almost all of the nine brawls seem to set a new standard for how fast I could jump out of my chair in amazement. Eventually, I give the nod to the much-anticipated showdown between Adkins and Crowder, the capoeira fighter who tore down the house with Tony Jaa in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector/dp/B000I0RNWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector</a>: their unprecedented agility and flexibility is complimented by extremely satisfying back-and-forth choreography and long, uninterrupted camera shots. No quick cuts or excess editing, here. Florentine is to be commended for putting so much effort into his craft. The only thing I can find fault with here is the choice of soundtrack that plays in the background: the hip-hop is very unfitting.

Production values are strong enough to have qualified for a theatrical release, with the exception of a few zoom-in closeups that are a trademark of Florentine's work. The acting content - always a gamble in the director's work - comes off as surprisingly strong. I was a bit disappointed that not a lot of authentic Russian is spoken, but the roles of the returning Scott Adkins and Mark Ivanir still feel legitimate. Mykel Jenkins' career should receive a boost following this film, for he proves himself a competent co-lead after ten years of supporting parts. In terms of realism, ""Redemption"" shies even further away from the realities of Russian prison life than ""Undisputed II"" did, but it's easier to forgive this time around.

Is ""Redemption"" a great martial arts movie? - absolutely. Is it as great as ""Last Man Standing""? Well, the production quality is certainly matched and the fight scenes prove that Florentine can always outdo himself, but some of the oomph from the prequel is lost on this one. Having Boyka as an antagonist helped make the first film so strong, and despite my previous praise, I don't think his shoes were 100% filled by Dolor and the wardens. Michael Jai White's presence is missed, but Mykel Jenkins provides an interesting alternate angle on the role of an American boxer in a European prison, if not the same level of hand-to-hand action, but Zaror, Crowder, and Choi marvelously accept this duty. Regardless of any perceived flaws, this movie will be hard to beat in the DTV market. You really don't need to bother with Van Damme, Seagal, or Lundgren if this movie is within reach. Buy it!",1277510400,17,7061,6.007944389275075
4120488,5,B003FXXNH6,"This movie is an A+ if you are looking for a great movie about fighting.

Boyka is a great protagonist. He will keep your interest in the movie even when there is no fighting going on.

As for the fights, they are amazing. The crew for Undisputed 3 put together a great cast of international talent for the tournament fight scene. Scott Adkins, who plays Boyka is great as aways. But look out for Marko Zaror who plays Dolor. That guy does some insane flying spinning kicks. No wire work here. All the flips and amazing kicks you see these guys perform is real.

Great final fight as well, that has a pretty shocking ending.

I got this movie to see cool fight scenes and this movie delivered.",1277251200,2,693,4.390625
4120489,4,B003FXXNH6,"If a casual fan of B-rate fight flicks were to come across this in the video store having not heard of the franchise, one could easily justify its dismissal.  Typically direct-to-video sequels to direct-to-video movies give fans just enough to barely keep them interested.  The fact that each new film in the series has switched the directions and motives of the main characters, in addition to making the previous antagonist the current protagonist is extremely refreshing.  Add to that some of the best fight choreography, filming, and editing this side of the Pacific ocean and you have a series of films that have increased in quality with each new release!  Director Isaac Florentine has taken his sweet time to give fans what they want to see.  And God bless him for it.  So much art is lost in the pursuit of cash.  I hope other directors are taking notes on his work.

Scott Adkins (""Ninja"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") returns as Uri Boyka, former prison fighting champion, who now has a bum knee after his crushing defeat at the end of ""Undisputed 2"".  He wants Russian mob boss Gaga (Mark Ivanir, who makes a very welcome return) to enter him in the first international prison tournament where the grand prize is total freedom.  Gaga refuses, knowing of his bad leg and absense from competition, until Boyka absolutely wastes the current Russian champ.  Boyka then packs for the Republic of Georgia and the 8-man elimination contest.  There are fighters from France, Croatia, Brazil, Greece, Korea, America, and the favorite, Columbian born Dolor (Marko Zaror, ""Kiltro""), resident of the host prison.  If the odds were not already stacked against Boyka, prison officials and mob bookies may have a few tricks up their collective sleeve to favor Dolor.

The fights?  Awww, yeah!  Adkins has already proven he belongs at the top of the list of current martial arts actors.  I was particularly excited to see Lateef Crowder again after his awesome fight with Tony Jaa in ""The Protector"".  He has two fights here, neither of which disappoints!  The casting of Chilean actor Marko Zaror as the lead bad guy is really where the brilliance comes in to play.  I had heard much about his skill from word-of-mouth and youtube clips but I really didn't know what to expect.  He is fantastic, not only in physical skill, but in his character portrayal as well. He speaks excellent English, even to the point where his sly wit comes shining through.  I want to see a lot more of this dude!  He is 6-and-a-half-feet of spin kicking mayhem!

This DVD has no special features and for that reason alone is disappointing.  Just a few trailers.  Not even a chapter selection!  I would like to see a lot more stuff with a release like this.  The blu-ray may have more, I'm not sure.  Who cares? This is still the most enjoyable film that I've seen in a LONG time.  I liked it more than ""Undisputed 2"" but I can't necessarily say that it's a better movie.  The script is nothing fancy but is more than adequate for fans of this type of movie.  Good character development, especially with Boyka and the American fighter, Turbo (Mykel Jenkins) and a few surprises.  4.5 of 5 and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!

So in the line of such movies as Bloodsport, The Quest, Best of the best, and other fight tournament movies this is pretty good. The fight scenes were well done and the story never got in the way of the fact that we want to see the fights.

4120491,5,B003FXXNH6,"Isaac Florentine's Undisputed 3: Redemption is, in my opinion, the best of the Undisputed series may be meaningful to those who know the earlier films. Scott Adkins reprises his role as Russian inmate Boyka, now severely hobbled by the knee injury suffered at the end of Undisputed 2. No longer the feared prison fighter he was, he has declined so far that he is now good only for cleaning toilets. But when a new prison fight tournament begins - an international affair, matching the best fighters from prisons around the globe, enticing them with the promise of freedom for the winner - Boyka must reclaim his dignity and fight for his position in the tournament.

He succeeds, of course, and is packed off to Georgia where he meets his opponents. The brash American. The Brazilian capoeira expert. The North Korean tae kwon do expert. A Greek. A Croat. And, most to be feared, the Colombian(Mark Zaror).

The fix is in, of course. While all of the other fighters are forced to do hard labor, the Colombian - the fighter backed by the host prison - is left to live in relative luxury. While the others are denied basic food, the Colombian has drugs hand delivered by the warden.
ScottAdkins plays Boyka - the villain of the last installment - here as a gruff antihero looking for personal redemption. All the story stuff works as it should.",1271980800,16,1342,4.682203389830509

4120500,4,B003FXXNH6,"Marvelously effective B-movie has Scott Adkins playing Boyka, a once great fighter whose busted knee has him mopping up flooded sewage and cleaning toilets in the lower level of a Russian prison.  Boyka trains himself back to sufficient health to beat the local prison champion and be entered into a cross penal fighting tournament in Georgia where the winner supposedly earns his freedom.  Unfortunately, the losers are never heard from again.  Also, unfortunately, the tournament is fixed in favor of the Columbian fighter.  All of the other fighters are given hard labor and an hour a day to train while the Columbian is given rest and performance enhancing drugs.

Scott Adkins isn't much of an actor but the Undisputed series (which is currently up to part IV) give him the chance to display an impressive physical agility that his more conventional action pictures can't really take advantage of.  He looks amazing in the fight scenes and also manages (to my ears at least) a more than passable Russian accent.

Director Scott Florentine who has helmed all of the Undisputed sequels to date isn't a great stylist but he knows how to stage his fight scenes for maximum bone crunching effectiveness.  He keeps the rest of the movie moving briskly and gets effective performances from his entire cast, although nothing here is the least bit subtle.  The villains are hissable.  Boyka glowering but noble.  Mykel Shannon Jenkins as the American, the motormouthed Turbo with whom Boyka eventually develops a grudging friendship is initially irritating (which was very likely the intention) but grows on you as the film goes on.

Nu Image, the studio behind these movies as well as Scott Adkins' entertaining Ninja films was reportedly set up by some people who worked at Cannon Studios in the 1980's.  The Undisputed sequels and Ninja series feel very much like classic Cannon exploitation films from their salad days before they tried to become respectable.  Their movies are fast paced, no nonsense entertainment that more than deliver the goods and are a cut above similar films from other studios, quality wise.  If you like this sort of thing Undisputed III is highly recommended.",1492300800,,2186,5.033333333333333

It's the character of Boyka who really elevates this film above the rank and file direct to video releases: he's so single-minded in his dedication to becoming the world's greatest fighter (despite a crippling knee injury and a tournament that's been rigged against him) that it's impossible not to love the guy--even if he is a convicted murderer.

This is a career-defining film for Scott Adkins, who will be referred to as ""Boyka"" from now until the day he dies, the same way my father-in-law refers to Sylvester Stallone as ""Rocky,"" regardless of which movie he's watching.

Anyway, Undisputed 3 is preposterously good for a direct-to-video release. It really is every bit as great as its fans would have you believe.

Scott is one of the TOP best martial arts kickboxers that I have seen yet and I'm sure he has to do a lot of intense training everyday to strive to be ONE of the best.

4120665,5,B003FXXNH6,"First off, watch Undisputed II: Last Man Standing before seeing Undisputed III.  Now on to it, after seeing U2 it's hard to imagine Uri Boyka (Scott Adkins) as a sympathetic character but that's the direction of Boyka in Undisputed III, and it totally works.  Hence the title ""Redemption.""

The movie takes place some years after LMS.  Big, bad Boyka ""the most complete fighter in the world"" is now reduced to being ""champion of the toilets"" mopping up the prison's fecal matter.  The nasty leg injury from years ago still plagues him.  Boyka is denied parole due to his heinous crimes and won't be eligible for another 15 years.  He realizes the only way he'll ever be free is to fight again or die trying.  Boyka's chance at freedom comes in the form of a prison tournament featuring the best prison fighters from around the world.  The winner gets his freedom and the crime syndicate hosting the fights earns millions of dollars.  Of course things are never as they seem as the organizers have already chosen who they want to win.

I gave Undisputed II 5 stars.  I would give this one 6 if I could.  Boyka is a very interesting character and Scott Adkins again does an amazing job.  What I think works so well in this movie is that you never really find out too much about the characters.  It leaves you wanting more.  Boyka's history is a complete mystery.  We know Turbo (Mykel Jenkins) was accused of a double murder, but it seems he's innocent or at least that's what I believe.  Mark Ivanir returns as the ever smarmy Gaga.  You can't help but like Gaga, and hopefully he'll be back for IV.  The acting in Redemption is much improved over LMS.  Everyone is believable in their roles.

Many different styles of fighting are featured in this one and all the bouts are well choreographed.  Adkins and Marko Zaror, as the extra creepy Raul Quinones, do an outstanding job during the fights and training montages.  The action is top notch and never quits.

Buy this movie!  It's the best $5 dollars you will ever spend on Amazon.  I have seen it 6 times already, and it never gets old.  I only wish there had been some extra content on the DVD like behind the scenes, bloopers, and commentary.  I also wish they had marketed this movie better.  Hopefully Undisputed IV will be in the works.  There is still so much to learn about Uri Boyka.  I want more in your face action!",1361577600,2,2377,4.533018867924528

The 90s saw Blood Fist, and now for the 2000s there is Undisputed 3. Undisputed 2 introduces Scott Adkin's character, the Russian Martial Arts Master Yuri Boyka. However, it is part three that really sees Boyka's prowess and lethality reach new heights.
The fights in this movie are great, the actors are convincing in their struggles in this prison fighting scheme, and Adkins and his main adversary, the Chiliean martial artist Marko Zaror pull out all the stops in a vicious final fight. In short, this is the best fight film in years.",1350432000,,652,4.728070175438597

Very happy with my Blu-ray Undisputed 3.",1349654400,,144,4.8
4120720,5,B003FXXNH6,"This movie starts off with the returning anti-hero Boyka, ""the most complete fighter"". This movie is much better than Undisputed II in that it leaves out all the sentimental garbage that was included in the sequel. Boyka left in a rat whole of a prison to mop the dirty floors and hobble around on is destroyed knee with little care after injuring it against ""Iceman"" Chambers is roused by an inter Prison fight competition. He trains through merciless pain to pull off some of the greatest martial arts moves I've seen in this genre of movie. Boyka then moves on to the big leagues of the seedy underground prison fighting league. There is some attempt at a storyline involving another American who would seem to resemble the attitude and physique of ""Iceman"" Chambers of the previous two movies. There is good back and forth between the two which ends up being the center of the movie as only one other character is truly developed albeit lightly throughout the storyline. We also receive a different perspective on the mob leader ""Ga Ga"" who seems to take on a lighter role in this movie. He was a feared and dangerous mob leader in the previous movie and proves more of a comic relief at times in this episode to some confusion.  Boyka also seems to make a change as he seems to have lost respect in the prison after his loss. He does not have groupies following him around waiting for him to beat them up when he is upset and the lunch room does not fall quiet when he walks in. This time Boyka is a broken man on the return which makes him more likeable, even though he's still retains his B.A. status.
Lots of great martial arts moves, decent story line, definitely worth watching.",1349481600,,1688,4.534426229508196

4120722,5,B003FXXNH6,"this movie is great because most of the fighters in this movie are real martial artists not like some other movies which the actor who don't really train in martial arts like never back down and stuff it's overrated also another reason why i think this movie is great because it has Scott Adkins in it and i think he is just a bad ass because his fighting style awesome which i really like out all fighters in this movie also Lateef  Crowder's style just insanely cool but it sucked that he dies in movie
so far this one and the second one are the best fighting movies in my opinion cause most MMA movies  just have boxing,kickboxing,Muay Thai and just regular Brazilian jujitsu like in this movie it has each fighter with a different discipline's like dolor has wing chun,Bruce lee style. lateef has Capoeira.

Scott has a balanced style mixed with Muay Thai, Japanese jujitsu,judo and some karate in it judging from some the kicks when he fight's lateef
so yeah watch this movie i think its great in my opinion",1343088000,,1012,4.51912568306011
4120723,4,B003FXXNH6,Well it had fair action it good a pretty good plot i didn't see that ending coming but the part where he hop of down the road is kinda more fun the like joy is the filling but i would have loved to see more or the boxer special style and skill set and a match between him and boyka or however u spell his name and idk bout u but it seems the russians have got their eye on black ppl they tryin to be friend us alot more in movies lately but idk a black russian that would be a monster in the ring lol but the but how boyka finished the last guy to win was to cartoon and CG could have ended that better if i hadnt seen part two i probably would have liked it more but still a good picture,1339200000,,688,3.719178082191781

Movie- The Blu-ray  quality is great both sound and picture. The story I would say is decent (better than a Juan Claude Van Damme movie in my opinion). The fighting is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! This movie makes you want to get up and smash the neighborhood bullies face, lol. Overall, this purchase is definitely worth it and VERY ENTERTAINING.

I have watched it 5 or 6 times since purchasing it and I have a feeling it's going to be in many ways this generation's ""Bloodsport"". Adkins is one of the most talented martial artists I have seen on film, and I think this movie is one of his best works to date. If you are looking for romantic comedy, Oscar winning acting, drama, or any of that stuff, you're obviously in for a disappointment but if you like a lot of action and don't mind some violence and language (I wait for the kiddos to go to bed before watching) you should appreciate the skill and talent that went into this movie.",1322956800,,709,4.298507462686567

What bothered me, though, was the disc itself.  No, there were no technical issues, it's just the only thing on it was the movie, NO SPECIAL FEATURES AT ALL.  Come on, would it kill you to throw in a couple of trailers and maybe a behind-the-scenes ""making of"" featurette?  Even its predecessor had that, buyer beware.",1321488000,,469,4.602409638554217

4120731,2,B003FXXNH6,"I actually ran across this movie at Best Buy for only $5. I now know why it was only $5. The movie was horrible and lacked substance. It was shot in a Russian Prison in which all the prisoners were bet on and used as fighters and in the process promised freedom. Instead if you lost then they killed you and if you won they kept betting on you. The film was very low budget. All they did in the movie was fight and do hard time in this Russian prison. The two main characters (shown on the cover) eventually devise an escape plan and with some outside help they are able to break out and become rich in the process. Don't waste your money. Unlike the 2 sequels before, there are no known actors in the movies everyone is a new comer and every one needs to go back to acting school.",1304726400,,781,4.111111111111111

Liking the two sequals in a series is unheard of, with that said STAY AWAY from Undisputed 1.  Just pick up part 2 and 3 and all the head-kicking-bone-breaking-blood-spewing action in these films should satisfy every mans man.

This film was especially enjoyable because they brought back a character that in part 2 was a VERY charismatic villian, so much in the 3rd movie they make him an anti-hero of sorts. It also brings back a few characters from the previous one that stood out and they have bigger parts.  The action is amped up in this as well from the previous installment.

You have to like these kind of low budget fighting movies to even consider reading this review, so i won't give you the ""no Oscar awards here"" speech. If you're looking for some class act fighting, rent this, or buy it. Adkins looks like he weighs well over 200 pounds, but has the kind of gymnastic skills that keep him flying through the air for that perfect punch.

The story is great, the action and fighting scenes are more than stunning, and it is very easy to get attached to the characters. I knew it was a straight to DVD movie when I saw it the first time, but I still do a mental double-take every time I watch it, and wonder how it never made it to the big screen.

This is like a cross between Van Dams old school classic Bloodsport and Jet Li's super smooth Fearless.
The fights are grounded (no obvious wire stuff) but the level of athleticism in Undisputed 3 is off the charts.
Each of the many fights have a different feel to them, so it never gets dull. Director Isaac Florentine and his crew know how to film/edit a fight, no choppy cuts, or shaky cam, just the actors showing off there abilities.

Plot is light, but plenty of characters to keep things interesting. All the fighters are pretty good actors also, they dish out some super cheesy lines, but they all made me smile, not cringe.

The story is very solid with several nice touches.  The directing is also top notch and the level of TLC given to the final product by everyone involved is evident.  The acting is good too (Scott Adkins and Mykel Shannon Jenkins in particular) and the character development in the film is outstanding.  And as for the fight scenes, more than a few of the moves on display will leave you scraping your jaw off the ground trust me.  Boyka-the film's main protagonist is also an instantly likable character despite being the villain of the second film.  Though he says few words-everything that comes out of Boyka's mouth counts.
