8117584,5,B000F4TMJG,"These are quality dvds of World World 2 European fighting action. The actors of ""Combat"" were talented and beleiveable. Also, the guest stars were all fine character actors. The TV series was both popular and well filmed. These episodes are great entertainment. I have ordered four different ""Combat - Best of...""s.  The WW2 fan will not be disappointed in these productions.",1183593600,3,375,5.147540983606557
