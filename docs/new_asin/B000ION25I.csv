2659693,5,B000ION25I,"All the bad reviews on this page almost kept me from watching this show! The only reason I watched it is because I accidentally rented this instead of ""Dane Cook: Vicious Circle.""  The video store had the box in the wrong place. Figures.

Anyway, I found the show completely fascinating. Due to the many bad reviews here, I had to throw in a good word to encourage others. I am not a die-hard Dane Cook fan like I know so many exist. I was an open-minded viewer expecting a bad show due to the Amazon reviews. Let's turn this around:

In watching the performers off stage we are treated to four adults in four distinct stages of career and success. Invest the emotional time to compare where you are at in your life to these comics. I found myself relating to them differently at various points throughout. I was hooked from episode one when Jay and Bobby (definitely not Silent Bob) struck back at each other over the merits of porn.

Their comedy pieces are alright. It's not the funniest comedy you will ever see presented here. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a train wreck. Or more accurately, like you are watching an episode of Project Greenlight where everything goes wrong. Watching them grow and adjust over the course of the episodes enthralled me.

And the last episodes featuring Dane and the others before they were famous is absolutely priceless and very moving. These things seem drool-worthy to Cook fans: watching footage of Dane when he was a teen, returning to his old high school years later, re-reading the letter he wrote to himself years ago...again I wonder why the bad reviews?

Anyone who appreciates human drama, sociology, psychology, or anyone who's ever had a dream to make it big will not be disappointed in this.",1168041600,6,1753,4.693811074918567
2659694,2,B000ION25I,"Got this DVD set as a delayed Xmas present. I was under the impression, from the case, that this was going to be a lot of stand up performances of Dane and the others. All it is is a series about them going on tour. There is nothing interesting about it. Nothing rewarding about it. I love Dane's jokes and all, but you only see about one joke from each comedian per episode. And the jokes that Dane tells are the one's from Retaliation. I wouldnt recommend this. I gave this 2 stars because it comes in a metal case.",1167350400,11,517,4.18
2659695,2,B000ION25I,"Love Dane, often listen to his CDs repeatedly at work.  Show was ""blah"".  Best thing to come out of it was me 'discovering' Gary.

If you're a hardcore Cook fan, of course pick this up.  O/w even if you love his stand up, it's just not an entertaining show.",1167264000,6,257,4.183673469387755
2659696,2,B000ION25I,"A good premise gets wasted with Dane Cook's Tourgasm, which promises to give a first person back stage view of the cross country comedy tour piloted by Dane Cook, Gary Gulman, Robert Kelly, and Jay Davis.  Cook has since become huge in the comedy world, and is even branching out into movies, while Gulman will be familiar with those who frequently watch stand up specials on Comedy Central.  Robert Kelly isn't very funny, and Jay Davis a newbie comedian who frequently gets made fun of by Kelly.  There's a few interesting and funny moments here, including Davis bombing frequently and given advice from Cook, but these moments are few and very far between.  Not to mention that for a series dealing with comedians, you'd expect maybe a few more snippets of the shows they play, and you get a few, but not as many as you might like.  Not to mention there is a point in the show where Gulman departs, and no background information as to why is ever really given.  Even if you are a die hard fan of Dane Cook, you'll have a hard time enjoying Tourgasm, especially if you're looking for frequently funny moments.  All in all, this may be worth a look for said die hard fans, but proceed with caution.",1165276800,14,1199,4.523148148148148
2659697,1,B000ION25I,Dane Cook is a hack that rips off material from other comedians.  Don't give this clown your money.,1165190400,10,99,4.5
2659698,2,B000ION25I,"I loved the premise, but boy was the show a let down.  A four comic team is a real drag when 3 of the 4 comedians aren't that funny.  Even this could have been countered by giving Dane a bit more face time than the rest (and with material that most fans hadn't already heard many times)...but of course that didn't happen.  The bus footage wasn't very insightful or interesting.  Neither were the obligatory reality show excursions that they took.

I haven't seen the DVD yet (it's still on pre-order).  Hopefully the bonus footage captures some of what the show itself missed.  If not, count this as a 1 star review.",1161820800,14,617,4.504504504504505
2659699,5,B000ION25I,"The guys' antics are hilarious.  I watched the series all summer and couldn't wait for the set to come to dvd.  I can't wait to see the bonus materials!  Dane Cook is a brilliant comedian, and I wish the tour came to my university.",1161734400,5,231,4.204545454545454
2659759,2,B000ION25I,"Of the three DVD's included, the majority of them ran fine, however one of the discs froze up several times. Additionally, the DVD's were loosely packaged in the DVD case and fall out upon opening the case.",1302652800,,206,4.594594594594595

I Thought It Was Very Entertaining Despite The Many Reviews. I Think People Expected More Of The Show's Which This Isent, Its What Happens On A Tour.

2659761,1,B000ION25I,It took me several tries to get through these DVDs. How could someone so funny be this unfunny... His friends are annoying... there is no real drama...Stay away.,1235952000,2,161,4.785714285714286
2659762,1,B000ION25I,"Tourgasm is an example of ego-gone-wild.  Dane Cook could only have been blinded by his super-fi-ego to have allowed this past the edit bay.  Tourgasm is how I know I would never see Jay Davis or Robert Kelly on Comedy Central, and that is fine with me!  Stand-up fans want to see comedians on-stage, not behind the scenes; and we only want to see interviews of established comedians.  We certainly don't want to see a bunch of middle-schoolers battle it out with their insecurities.  Watching this mistake-of-an-idea was a wrenching experience.  I congratulate Gary Gulman, a talented and very hot-looking comedian, for leaving the tour for many days in order to keep away from the supreme negativity of his colleagues, day in and day out.  Gary Gulman has depth, and you can see it, and hear it in his comedy.  Dane Cook's shining moment was in Viscious Circle - not sure if he can do another thing like that, but let's hope so.  Gulman's fan base is all ages due to his depth; Cook appeals mostly to teens and 20-something's.  Some of us in our early-40's will enjoy Viscious Circle and that may be it.  He seems to keep himself hyped-up and convinced of his awesomeness, surrounding himself with the positiveness of fans who think he's awesome and cute, supposedly never doing drugs/alcohol.  Maybe he should go into depth-training and have a drink with some other types of people for a change...and listen to them.  I don't doubt for one minute that ""he can't make a relationship last past 55 minutes"".",1199836800,4,1507,4.727969348659004
2659763,2,B000ION25I,"As a reality show staring four young comics traveling across the country, each with distinct personalities, styles and levels of experience this show (I guess you'd call it) is amusing. The interactions between the four are sometimes insightful, sometimes annoying, and often entertaining if not particularily hilarious. As a reality show it's ok and worth watching maybe once. But you know what would have made this show great? If it was funny. The standup routines including Dane Cook's might make you smile once or twice but there's little in the way of side splitting hilarity to be found. In fact there isn't any. No full set is provided either, rather just edited bits and pieces, dribs and drabs. For a reality show it's not bad, for a comedy dvd it's covered in flop sweat.",1187654400,,781,4.835820895522388
2659764,2,B000ION25I,"I am a huge Dane Cook fan, but he's been disappointing me lately.  My biggest complaint about this DVD is that it does not include a clip of the full stand-up act.  It's mostly about their 'adventures' on tour, providing only sample bits from the show.  And the bits are FUNNY!  I want more stand-up comedy, less reality show.",1182643200,4,326,4.47457627118644
2659765,1,B000ION25I,"I'm also a Dane Cook fan, but not this time around. Tourgasm had potential. And despite that potential - 4 comedians traveling across the country in a tour bus - this reality TV-like concept falls flat on its face. There was no comedy throughout the entire DVD. NOTHING WAS FUNNY! The comedians in it complain more than they make jokes. This DVD was a waste of money and time. Spare yourself.

Dane, if you're out there, stop with this promotional stuff and give us something with more substance. Your bits are hilarious. Your future as a reality TV-star? No so much.",1178496000,3,567,4.6138613861386135
2659766,3,B000ION25I,"Found the travel segments to lack the humor I was looking for in a Dane Cook DVD.  Dane's commentary and various personal segments were entertaining and even enlightening, but the travel segments were not what I was looking for in a Dane Cook DVD.  The tales of their travels assists in developing and understanding each comedian, but I was looking for more stage presence.  Above average overall.",1173312000,,397,4.895522388059701
2659767,3,B000ION25I,"I was a little disappointed that there wasn't very much stand-up.  However, seeing the four of them trying to make it on the road was pretty funny.",1172102400,,147,4.444444444444445
2659768,4,B000ION25I,"for a 3 dvd set this was pretty good. it was funny and interesting.  I would have to say my only complaint is that there was not say one whole concert performance on the DVD, that showed their entire show of all 4 of them, the Penn State show would have been perfect for that.  If you like Dane cook and liked Vicious Circle, you will like this dvd.",1169596800,,349,4.043478260869565

8146768,1,B000ION25I,"I was expecting this to be a series of stand up sets, but instead it was basically just the 'behind the scenes' of the tour.  There was a lot of drama and for the most part this was extremely annoying.  I was really saddened that this wasn't better because I really like Dane Cook and Gary Gulman so I was excited to see more stuff by the both of them.
