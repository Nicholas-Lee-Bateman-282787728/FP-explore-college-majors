8732744,5,B0155TSM0A,"Seasons 2 and 3 of Supernatural were some of the best seasons of the entire show, in my opinion. This was long before angels and more complicated monsters take over the later seasons. Here we just have Sam and Dean saving people, hunting things, and working together.

In Season 2, We see Sam struggle with his visions that have to do with the Yellow Eyed Demon and that leads Sam and Dean to meeting others like Sam. In the end they face off with the Demon, but Dean faces a dire consequence that leads up to Season 3.

Favorite Episodes of Season 2:
Season 2, Episode 15: Tall Tales: This is where we first meet the Trickster. It is a more lighthearted episode that has some funny moments.
Season 2, Episode 17: Heart: This was a sadder episode because any time that you see Sam cry, it breaks your heart a little. No spoilers here, but the ending is really what tugs at your heartstrings.

In Season 3, We see Dean trying to fight for his soul after selling it to save Sam's life in Season 2. In this season we also meet Ruby, the demon that wants to help Sam save Dean's soul. In the end of the season, they face off with Lilith, the demon who wants to collect Deans soul and it ends badly for the brothers.

Favorite Episodes of Season 3:
Season 3, Episode 3: Bad Day at Black Rock: This is possibly my favorite episode of the entire series so far! It's a rabbit foot! Sam and Dean investigate a case involving a rabbits foot and after Sam touches it and then looses it his luck runs bad and the results are very amusing. He looses his shoe and falls down a lot, and looks like an adorable sad puppy while doing so!
Season 3, Episode 11: Mystery Spot: In this episode, we meet the Trickster again, where he sets up Sam to live the same day over and over again and he has to watch Dean die repeatedly. While the message the trickster was sending Sam was sad, that he has to get used to his brother being gone if he gets sent to hell, the episode itself had a lot of comic relief in all of the crazy ways Dean dies.

Overall, these 2 seasons were great and I recommend all of the series to anyone that has never seen Supernatural before!
