3521119,5,B001D0G3MK,"Very good for a person planning a trip to Okinawa, or just to know more about it.  We are moving there, but had a tough time finding this type of information despite utilizing various resources to try and acquire information. My kids learned from watching it, and now we know more than probably the typical 3 year island dweller about fun and unique things to do. I also liked that the filmmaker was not only a tourist, but had family ties to the area, it added authenticity to the film.  It is also a calm, no frills video which I like. A great value for any person moving there, or for anyone-adult or child- to learn more about this wonderful place.",1386028800,,652,4.380165289256198
3521120,4,B001D0G3MK,This travelogue covers the island from top to bottom with surprisingly good photography and narration.  It gave us a good preparation for our forthcoming trip to Okinawa after being away for over 25 years.  It opened our eyes to a lot of things to do and see which we might not otherwise have considered.,1367020800,,304,4.611111111111111
3521121,4,B001D0G3MK,We watched this and thought it was good as it gave a good overview of Okinawa.  It was like watching  a home video that someone published for mass viewing.  Again good overview of Okinawa and would recommend it.  Worth 4 stars.,1338076800,,227,4.463414634146342
3521122,1,B001D0G3MK,Doesn't so Okinawa like a local would see it. Sohows it like a tourist with no local knowledge would. He just took a ravel book and camera and filmed what it said he should do in a book. Complete rubbish,1289952000,,203,4.1
3521123,5,B001D0G3MK,"I actually was looking for travel films on japan when I came across this one, many others were quite cold and less detailed but I was very happy that I watched this one. As this is an okinawa tour video you get a really good look at this island from top to bottom from flora and fauna to festivals. very well presented and edited, james does a good job with narration. sadly though this is only a film made about okinawa and not the other islands as a series, a very enjoyable experience.",1265155200,,488,4.258064516129032
3521124,5,B001D0G3MK,"If you are looking for a stuffy, high-budget video tour of Okinawa, this video is not for you. However, if you are looking for a view of Okinawa from someone who shows a passion for the culture, you might want to give this a look. Mr. Knott provides a comprehensive tour of the island's many fascinating sites, and his love for his subject is obvious. Not only do you get to see the various points of interest in Okinawa, but you get a glimpse of life inside an Okinawan household when Mr. Knott introduces his wife's Okinawan relatives. The presence of these relatives in the video and the warmth with which they invite the viewer (and the producer) into their lives adds depth to the geographical tour by adding authenticity to Mr. Knott's portrayal of the Okinawan people.

My family will be moving to Okinawa soon, and this tour of Okinawa just increased our excitement.",1232496000,7,874,4.638709677419355
3521125,2,B001D0G3MK,It was more like a nature video with stupid jokes.  I saw more of the his family than Okinawa.,1231804800,,94,3.9473684210526314
3521126,5,B001D0G3MK,I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is traveling to or is thinking of traveling to Okinawa.  I bought it a few months ago prior to my first trip to Okinawa and it was worth every penny.  I didn't have two weeks to travel the sites but I was able to see the ones I was most interested in seeing thanks to the video (the Makishi Public Market was so cool).  Thank you for putting this together Mr. Knott - amazing work.,1228176000,2,429,4.083333333333333
3521127,4,B001D0G3MK,"I took a chance on this DVD and am happy I did.  The guide hits most of the major spots on the main island of Okinawa.  It took me back to my times visiting my relatives in Okinawa.  I miss them so much.  I loved the DVD, but except for Ie-jima, they never leave the main island.  That's why I only gave it 4 stars.  There were a few places on the other islands I would have liked to see.  It was great seeing Shuri, Naha and the Churaumi Aquarium.  Also, seeing the bullfights reminded me of going to the bullfights with my uncle as a little girl.",1228089600,7,548,4.0092592592592595
3521128,5,B001D0G3MK,"Hello, My name is James Knott and I am the producer of this video.  It is about my experience traveling around the island of Okinawa.  I just wanted to post the product description since I didn't see it elsewhere on Amazon.  Below you can find the chapters that are on the DVD.  Thanks for watching.  Enjoy!

8290694,3,B001D0G3MK,It was good but had hoped to see more places instead of so much about his family and  town of Naha. Felt the price was high for the content.,1481241600,,140,3.8275862068965516

8290701,4,B001D0G3MK,"Could have done without the gratuitous shots of his friends, but it was a good final product.  It seems like a reasonable review of island-wide events and locations, but far from complete.  It seems as if he took one trip to Okinawa and filmed a lot while there.  Then he turned it into a movie for sale.  As a result, it misses some things and pays only a glancing reference to other important locations and tourist sites.  For instance, he missed the Japanese Navy's underground headquarters, but we were ""treated"" to a 10 minute walk up an overgrown path where he stood on top of a marker and strutted a pose (FYI, you're not supposed to stand on the marker).  If you're going to Okinawa it's a nice reference and it does disabuse the American viewer from the Hollywood ""Karate Kid II"" impression.",1424390400,,800,4.559440559440559
8290702,5,B001D0G3MK,Thank you so much for giving me back the best 2 years of my life! It takes me back when I watch your DVD!,1405468800,,105,3.4166666666666665
8290703,2,B001D0G3MK,"This fairly brief video tour of Okinawa was more like a home video with narration culled from Wikipedia.  The person doing the video has Ryukuan family ties which adds to the experience, I guess, but it felt more like ""visiting my family in Okinawa.""  I rented it because I was curious to see modern Okinawa, having lived there for a couple of years in the early '60s when it was anything but modern!  Pretty disappointed.",1392681600,,422,4.6
