On the eve of the December 2015 Paris Climate Accords I am returning to add to this review [more than 10 months later].

I have found myself repeatedly reflecting on the beautiful images and haunting truths that this important film provides. It is the one film I can unhesitating recommend.  If you're lucky enough to have stumbled on this item - purchase (or rent it), and share the message with those you love.  It is an extraordinary, true and beautiful story.

8508643,5,B0071WQ8A6,"The Spectre of Hope is an amazing look at the work of photographer/economist Sebastiao Salgado. His visual exploration of the effects of a globalized economy on the third world is must know material for anyone living in the fast disintegrating first world. This movie shows us the plight of the 'other', and warns us that we are dangerously close to becoming these 'others'. As incomes become tenuous, as markets move in search of profit instead of happiness what is left behind are the growing masses on the short end of globalization. Mr. Salgado has captured all of this in the beautiful black and white images that make up this film. His conversation with John Berger illuminates the process behind this massive work photographing the millions of dispossessed.
Buy this movie and show it to anyone who will watch.",1360886400,6,817,4.927536231884058
