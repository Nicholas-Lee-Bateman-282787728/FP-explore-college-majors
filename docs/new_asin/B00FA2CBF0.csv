5972758,4,B00FA2CBF0,"I have nearly all of Denise's videos and this one is a great addition.  I wouldn't say I worked up a huge sweat but I still felt like it was a great medium level workout. I am 62 years old and a regular exerciser.  If you are wanting a high energy video like her Boot Camp videos, this would probably be too easy for you.  One thing I like about Denise's videos is that are reasonable in length and difficulty but still provide results if done consistently.  I was a little disappointed in the music background.  Some of it is the same music used in another video of hers and for being a take on Zumba, not very energetic rhythms.  I do wish Denise would pump up the music on her videos.  It would make them a little more fun.",1388793600,11,726,4.142857142857143
5972759,5,B00FA2CBF0,"I have been a Denise Austin fan for a number of years and own most of her workout DVDs.  I have been disappointed with some of her more recent DVDs; however, I still decided to give her newest release the ""Burn Fat Fast Latin Dance"" a try.  It was great!  Fun is not usually a word I ascribe to cardio workouts, but this workout was fun.  This was clearly Denise's take on the Zumba craze, but what she created was a fun, energizing, and even sexy workout that gets you moving.  The dance steps were relatively easy to learn, but it still gets your heart rate up.  Of all of Denise's ""dance"" workouts, this is by far the best.  If you are looking for a fun, enjoyable, cardio workout, this is it.  I would highly recommend it.",1387497600,48,726,4.248175182481752
5972760,4,B00FA2CBF0,"Denise Austin is an inspiration, however, I found this routine not as flowing as the others I have.  I'm in pretty good shape (I'm Denise's age), however, I couldn't keep up.  Her other routines were fast paced, but flowing.",1386720000,,224,4.717948717948718

5972763,1,B00FA2CBF0,Agree with the lady who said Denise should not have done a Latin dance video. My first video of hers..and it's clear she doesn't know how to dance. The back up dancers should have lead. And Denise has plastered this awful fake smile on her face the whole time...and sounds so bored and unsincere. Time to retire? Methinks.

5972768,3,B00FA2CBF0,"I love Denise Austin workouts, but I was expecting some new moves instead she just recycled all of her previous workout moves from some of her Dance Mix DVD, and common workouts when she adds a segment of Latin moves. It's overall a fun workout and I was sweaty after the 30 mins of using it. I'm disappointed with the misleading title though.",1465776000,3,343,4.4603174603174605

I don't think it qualifies as Latin dance; there are barely any Latin moves....a lot of moves are her regular moves you'd see in other workouts. But it will get your heart going....it's cardio. Lighter one, I guess.",1439856000,,256,4.468085106382978

5972787,3,B00FA2CBF0,"I wasn't expecting a challenging workout with this, but even for a light workout this takes a bit to warm me up. The hops and quicker movements that come in the middle of the workout and toward the end helped. The cardio dance workout is about thirty one minutes and the toning one with light weights is about ten minutes. I did them together so it was a better workout. This isn't a bad DVD. The dance moves make it interesting. It's just not challenging if you work out a lot. That said, it definitely has merit. You get warmed up a ways into it, and it's good for days when you want light cardio. Someone just starting out might get more out of it.
Denise is in good shape and always so cheerful.",1425859200,4,699,4.223880597014926
5972788,1,B00FA2CBF0,"OK, no. So wrong in so many ways. Let me just start by saying that growing up a gymnast in top shape some of Denise's videos were still super challenging so even though I'm 29, I'm a big Denise fan. I know she is capable of great things but why Denise, why? The video starts and continues with a ""sexy walk."" I think its an attempt at a cardio salsa step? But it looks like Denise is doing the potty dance. It is bad, very bad and it just doesnt stop. Anyways, five months postpartum and not sweating. Please Denise redeem yourself for all of us who grew up fans. Oh well, back to Jillian Michaels. Hope this thing is returnable! Very disappointed.",1425427200,,648,4.276422764227642

5972790,5,B00FA2CBF0,"Love this!  I love salsa anyway, so this is perfect.  She moves fast, so keep up, but after you've done it once or twice you'll know what to do.  It is a fun way to workout and I do work up a sweat.",1420502400,,198,3.558139534883721

5972792,3,B00FA2CBF0,"I love Denise, but this just feels a little off.  If done all-out it will make you sweat, however I would stick to Zumba for Latin dance workouts.  Music definitely doesn't motivate here.  I did think the bonus 10 min toning was nice though for a quickie.",1419897600,2,255,4.382978723404255

5972801,5,B00FA2CBF0,I was looking for a Latin Dance DVD that wasn't too intense or difficult to follow. I also did not want anything too lengthy or boring. Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast Latin Dance did not let me down! It's fun to exercise to and your workout is completed before you know it! Within a couple of  weeks I was firmer and could tell my body was shaping up! Denise is also so encouraging and certainly did a great job implementing dance as exercise that was fun and easy to follow! Glad I bought it!,1406160000,,492,4.23404255319149
5972802,5,B00FA2CBF0,I love working out to Denise Austin's video's.  This one is no exception.  It gives a good workout in a short 30 minutes of time.  Then if you chose a 10 minute strengthening routine which I take advantage of.,1401926400,2,209,4.3076923076923075
5972803,3,B00FA2CBF0,I got it because I really need to find something I can do at home because time is limited.  I hadn't done any aerobic stuff in many years but I thought I would be okay learning some new steps...that did not happen.  I completed the video but at times I just had to march in place because I was struggling to learn a particular move of hers.  But I'm not giving up!  I will try again because at least I found that I did get a pretty good aerobic workout from it *LOL*.  I wouldn't say this is for beginners.  I wish there had been a review of the moves before the actual workout began!,1399593600,10,584,4.034782608695652
5972804,4,B00FA2CBF0,"Not the old Denise Austin but OK.  She gets the job done and it lasts about 35min. and has another 10 min. of toning.  Gets a little old hearing her say ""Good!"" but it's possible when we learn it we can cut off the sound, ha.  Good warm up and cool down and stretching.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1399161600,8,302,3.9833333333333334

5972806,5,B00FA2CBF0,Ladies this will make you want to get up and dance and shake your groove thing and get in shape at the same time.  She doesn't even talk that much so you can actually hear the music or you could mute it and groove to your own tunes.,1394409600,8,232,3.8333333333333335
5972807,4,B00FA2CBF0,Easy to dance along with Denise.  Instructions are easily understood and good beat to the music.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes to salsa.,1393459200,4,146,4.8
5972808,2,B00FA2CBF0,"I love Denise Austin and I wanted to try another DVD in her series.  Latin Dance is all the craze in the fitness world so I thought I would give this a try.  This is very fast and complicated for someone who never took dance classes.  You really need to know how to Latin dance in order to benefit from this workout.  Also, there is a lot of jumping during the workout so it is rough on those who have joint problems.  Most of the cartilage in my left knee is gone and that has left me very arthritic.  I don't feel as though I get much of a workout while I'm confused and very ungraceful.",1389225600,38,589,4.0344827586206895
5972809,5,B00FA2CBF0,"I'm a healthy, young graduate student. I often skipped workouts due to the demanding nature of my program. I used to do lots of pop-style ""Zumba"" (emphasis on current music, minimal latin dance) at my gym at home and loved it. I like this video because sure, you do a mambo or salsa step, but its more pop-style dance moves than strict latin style. They are really easy dance moves that anyone can follow after watching the video 2 times. I am glad I bought this video. People who are into crossfit, weight lifting, and extreme running, this video is not for you. This is what I consider to be an advanced beginner cardio workout.  This is for girls/guys who maybe aren't thrilled about traditional exercise and want to work up a good sweat. This video gets my heart rate going and I usually burn 250-300 calories doing it. Highly recommend",1389139200,26,840,4.562913907284768
5972810,5,B00FA2CBF0,"For me, this is a great DVD to get me motivated to start exercising. The steps were easy to follow and I definitely worked up a healthy sweat.

8613598,5,B00FA2CBF0,"I have been  looking for a dance work out  DVD workout that is easy to follow, but at the same time fun to do. I found this online in amazon along with the Zumba DVD, I read all the reviews and gave it a shot for the price. I had the chance to try this workout the other day and I was not disappointed at all- it works for me,  someone  who's looking for just the right movements that I can follow but at the same time would enjoy doing it. I  prefers dancing to burn calories than go to GYM  so finding this DVD is definitely well worth it -  I enjoyed it, had fun with it, and I sweat big time!

8613601,5,B00FA2CBF0,I just finished this workout and found it to be very fun and effective and as I have exercised continually for 30 years plus and have done many different kind of workouts with many different instructors I think I know what is good and what is bad.  This is an excellent video with a latin theme. She does not claim it is zumba. I have read some horrible reviews on here that make me feel that they come from her nasty jealous competitors. Talk about slash and burn! This is for intermediates plus and is excellent. It is not Denises fault if people are out of shape and cannot keep up. This is why people do these exercise so that they can keep up eventually. Wonderful fun workout that gets your heart rate up and tones the bod.,1491696000,,729,4.282608695652174

First of all,it's pretty obvious that Denise is not really good at Latin dancing. Just not her forte. The workout starts out pretty much full blast- without an adequate warm-up in my opinion..  The moves overall are okay.  I would say this workout is too fast paced for a beginner, but fine for someone who works out regularly.",1489104000,,443,4.569620253164557

Not results oriented,  I cannot say one thing positive about this workout program.  I was so very disappointed as I expected so much more from Denise Austin.  I guess she took a break on this one.  And as far as it being this Latin workout...not really.  Just a step here and there.  Listen to me on this one  and do not purchase this series it is a waste of money.
