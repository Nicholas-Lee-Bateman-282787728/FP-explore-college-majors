8249318,4,B00136MBK2,"This is a very good video or DVD, even though it is not a Tai Chi learning video pre-se, as some might assume. That is, it is not a 1 to 24 form lessons, as a lot of video are. What it does have is two very good workouts, with a lot of tai chi and qigong movements included. C J McPhee is a delightful and knowledgeable instructor. C J demonstrates with a group, which I find better than a sole demonstrator. This video would be a very good introduction to tai chi movements, but not the last video you would want on tai chi-qigong.",1364342400,16,532,4.076190476190476
