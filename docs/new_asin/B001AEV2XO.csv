Kimberly and Katherine - the instructors - give a very detailed description of each movement, and they show WHAT NOT TO DO, which is a great help.

Try their free video podcasts at iTunes or their web site, [...] if you want to learn their teaching style. Actually I've been subscribing their video podcasts for several months, which was my motive to buy this DVD, and I learned a lot more from them than from my real life pilates instructors.

Most of pilates DVDs in the market, or at least those I have, show only perfect movements by perfectly groomed instructors. On the contrary, 'Pilates on the Go' is like a real pilates class in the real world.

It also has kind of home-video feel, and makes me feel like I'm doing the exercise with them.

The DVD is divided in several parts: warm up, tummy tightener, butt blaster, arms enhancer, legs, core challenge, cool down, and tips which are very helpful to do the exercise. You can choose the parts you want and create your own session.

I strongly recommend this for those who are sick of 'PERFECT' exercise DVDs, and want to learn pilates movements from real instructors.",1218585600,5,1179,4.644230769230769
