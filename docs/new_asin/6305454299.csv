1029199,5,6305454299,This video has it all Austin at his best.  He is the best damn champion ever!.  This video shows all his matches from King of the Ring98 all the way to Backlash.  Austin kicks ass and ask questions later.  This video is  better than the Rock's video.  He curses like crazy it shows how he is out  of the ring.  The beerbath scenes and when he kicked the Rock's ass!  Austin shows me why he inspires me he is a legend.  I love this video to  death and that's the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so!  I am proud to  be a fan of this great athlete buy it it's worth it.  Another note is he  said the reason why.  He made the snakeskin belt was a F?$ you to Vince.  I  feel all of these are shoot interviews.  THE RATTLESNAKE RULES 100% PURE  WHOOP ASS.  Great video another WWF hit!,930268800,,781,4.006578947368421
1029255,5,6305454299,"I love this DVD. In the main feature - Hell Yeah - a video crew follows Steve Austin around for 3 days...on the road (literally), back-stage, funny-car races, a Mets/Mariners game, & more. Austin talks about his wild ride from early 98 though mid 99. The DVD has 5 sections, & here's how it looks:

Hell Yeah:

- WrestleMania XIV - Austins thoughts on winning the title for the 1st time at the biggest event of the year.

- King Of The Ring 98 - His 1st Blood against Kane, & winning the title back the next night on RAW.

- Road Rage - Austin talks about the zambonie, cement truck, monster limo, beer truck, & monster trucks (there's a funny story about the camera man taking a bump).

- SummerSlam 98 - vs. Undertaker - Austin talks about getting briefly knocked out during the match, & how the smoking skull belt developed.

- Over the Edge 98 - vs. Dude Love. Mr. McMahon stacks the deck against the Rattlesnake.

- Breakdown 98 - vs. Kane & Undertaker, & the next night on Raw with a vacant WWF Title.

- Judgment Day - Austin referees Kane vs. Undertaker. He has to call it down the line or gets fired. I think everyone knows what happens that night & on Raw the next night. Clipps are shown leading to the Survivor Series, & his feud with the Undertaker.

- Buried Alive Match - vs. Undertaker. Clipps then show the Royal Rumble 99, & the buildup to...

- St Valentine's Day Massacre - vs. Mr McMahon. Also Austin talks about his musical tastes (""Rule #1, don't touch his radio"").

- WM XV - vs. The Rock. Also his various TV & other appearances (funny car race, baseball game) are shown.

- Backlash 99 - The Rock/Austin feud continues.

Rattlesnake Rules:

- This Belt's For You - Austin tosses Rock's IC title into the river.

- Rattlesnake Wrecking Co - The opening moments of Rock vs. Austin from the DX PPV.

- The @#$%'s On - Austin drives the zamboni to the ring.

- Drinkin' On The Job - The beer truck incident.

- Calling Dr. Austin - Another classic moment in the Austin/McMahon feud. Mr. McMahon is attacked in the hospital.

Say What, Jackass?:

- Road Dogg, Edge, Godfather, D'Lo Brown, Mr. Ass, Jeff Jarrett, Jerry Lawler, Jim Ross, Rock, & Triple H talk candidly about Austin & his impact.

The Book of Austin:

- Austin 3:16 Chapter 1 - The classic King Of The Ring speech.

- Cause Stone Cold Said So - Austin's reign of terror outside the ring - At Brian Pillmans house, beating a camera man in the studio, & more.

- Can Of Whoop-Ass - Austin's in ring dominance.

- Talkin' @#$%? Here's How - Some of Austin's best trash talking.

- Pulp Austin - Building up to the Royal Rumble.

- BMF - Austin talks about his unique walk to the ring.

- If You Want Me To Beat Mr. McMahon's Ass... - Austin talks about being motivated by McMahon not wanting him to be champion, leading to one of the most intense, insane feuds of all time.

- Dress Code? Hell, No! - Steve Austin: Corporate Champion?

- Wanna Raise Some Hell? - Austin tell about how he interacts with the fans.

Last Call:

- Expect No Mercy - The Corporate Ministry feud with Austin, with clips from Over The Edge 99, Austin becoming CEO, the King Of The Ring 99 Ladder Match for ownership of the WWF, & Austin regaining the WWF Title from the Undertaker on RAW.

- The Bottom Line - An article taken from the 'Austin 3:16' Magazine.

- StoneCold.com - a weblink - probably not to useful any more.

As I said, I love this DVD. If you're an Austin fan, buy it.",1129075200,11,3444,4.303265940902022

1029257,1,6305454299,"Stone Cold: Hell Yeah is essentially a collection of:
- highlights (but not complete video) of eleven Austin pay-per-view matches;
- plot-related videos;
- and some commentary on Steve Austin by ten wrestling personalities (about one minute per commentary) - Road Dogg, Edge, Godfather, D'Lo Brown, Mr. Ass (Billy Gunn), Jeff Jarrett, Jerry Lawler, Jim Ross, The Rock, and Triple H.

Meant for die-hard Steve Austin fans who followed WWE's RAW and pay-per-view programs in 1998 and 1999, this DVD offers little context and explanation to help newer wrestling fans appreciate the drama and excitement that Stone Cold Steve Austin evoked to bring professional wrestling to new heights of popularity.",1119398400,3,697,5.336363636363636
1029258,4,6305454299,"Stone Cold is the man,He cusses,drinks beer,and kicks ass. And this video shows that and then some. Austin is about as American
as red,white,and blue. Watching kick Vince the owner of the WWF
never gets old. The stunner is great and it looks so cool. Stone
Cold also beats the sh** out of Kane,The Undertaker,and The Rock
he also drives monster trucks,Zambodis,and cement trucks all over
the arena. I bought this video for 99 cents and it was worth it.

But when it comes to being the toughest S.O.B.in the buisiness, there is no one like stone cold steve austin. You Have to get this dvd to see it all for yourself. There's a ton of classic stone cold steve austin footage as well as Stone cold's attack on Vince Mcmahon in a Hospital! wwether it's drinkin' on the job, talkin' trash or beating soemeone's ..., Nobody and I mean Nobody does it better than STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN!",1016236800,2,516,4.442105263157894

I Do Not See Any Ring Skills Commin From Tha Man. I See Sloppy Ring Work When He Wrestles. I Never Liked Austin From When He Was Tha Ring Master Till Now With Tha Alliance. Now Who I Think Is The Greatest Champion Of All Time Would Have To Be My Olympic Hero Kurt Angle. The Fastest Come Up In WWF History, Its Still Early But He Will Be The Main Star In Tha Future.

1029262,5,6305454299,"The WWF don't spare anything when manufacturing their DVD's.  They throw in everything that they think their fans will find interesting.  While I thought both Wrestlemania and Summerslam were spoiled with extras, this DVD Hell Yeah proves to me that those PPV's had only a miniature amount of extras.  Stone Cold's Hell Yeah has a bucketful of extras.
If you're a WWF fan, you like Stone Cold.  He is the number one guy in the business right now.  Though the Rock proved he could carry the WWF for a year, Stone Cold is back and he's badder than ever.  This DVD will give new fans a lot of pleasure watching what Stone Cold used to get up to.  For the regular viewers, it provides a happy trip down Memory Lane.
The Hell Yeah section itself is fun.  It doesn't allow us to watch much of the match and to be honest I would be disappointed if this was all I got for my money (if I bought the VHS version).  However the extras are three time as long as the Hell Yeah Section itself.  There are 8 or 9 wrestlers giving personal interviews on Stone Cold.  There is history of his career as far back as his Austin 3:16 speech.
It is a great package and a must for any Austin fan.",979171200,,1173,4.238738738738738

It just wasn't the same as  ""Uncensored.""  It does chronicle his feuds with the Rock, and Mr.  McMahon, and gives pretty good insight.

The highlights of his matches are great, but the best parts are  when they show backstage footage, and him driving his truck.

7889335,4,6305454299,"""Cause Stone Cold Said So"" was about his breakout year, ""Austin 3:16 Uncensored"" was about his road to the championship, ""Hell Yeah"" is the third set in Steve Austin's career detailing his year after becoming the champion not just inside the ring but also outside as well as we follow Stone Cold backstage & on the road throughout this tape.  Now keep in mind that this is the first Stone Cold tape along with one of WWE's first DVD sets but I only saw the VHS tape so I don't have any information on bonus materials & DVD extras.

Austin begins the tape talking about what he thinks makes someone successful in the business before we see highlights of his WWE Championship victory over Shawn Michaels & his thoughts on the championship.  We then see footage of Austin backstage revealing some of his backstage jokes & superstitions while also seeing highlights leading into his First Blood match against Kane along with the rematch the next night on RAW.  The various vehicles Austin has driven (from a truck to the zamboni to the monster trucks & everything in-between) is shown with Austin telling stories behind each incident before going into his SummerSlam match against Undertaker in 1998 & how he was actually knocked out during the match followed by the concept of his personal ""Smoking Skull"" championship.  Various video packages & thoughts from Austin on his feuds leading up to his matches against Dude Love (Over The Edge), Undertaker & Kane (Breakdown & the buried alive match at Rock Bottom) before getting into his heavy issues with Vince ranging from getting fired to their cage match.  Austin gets more personal from here talking about his favorite types of music including where the influence of his theme music came from & see footage of his various outside ventures ranging from his race car to public appearances to his guest acting role on Nash Bridges before concluding on showing highlights of his matches again The Rock at WrestleMania XV & Backlash and Austin talking about him paying his dues in the business.

Along with this being the usual WWE profile tape they put out at that time chronically showing highlights of recent feuds & moments, this was an extra treat for that time with the camera following Austin in the life of the top attraction for the company while also getting to know Austin more personally than his previous tapes have shown.  If your an Austin fan or fan of the Attitude Era, this is a must have to your collection & that's the bottom line.",1302134400,2,2495,4.745958429561201
7889336,1,6305454299,"Steve Austin was the biggest draw in WWF history and this set shows his peak years of 98-99. They are basic WWF/WWE clips that shows why the are feuding like they do on PPV's and then it shows highlights of the match. It goes by very quick and the video is poorly done, probably just to cash in on his name at the time. I would skip this set because it's not worth the money.

One problem I have with the dvd is WWF lets Austin use the s word freely but blocks out some other curse words. I don't know why WWE insults fans by beeping out curse words, everyone swears and if they cant handle it then thats too bad.",1265241600,,613,4.024590163934426

You don't get any full match; you just get clips of what happened in the matches. You also get clips of what happened in between the PPVs.

Hell Yeah is one of the better Stone Cold period pieces. He talks out of character about how things affected him. The DVD itself is fairly well done. Stone Cold narrates it, and you can really see the type of person he is at times. You get a bunch of generic stock music during the match clips, but it is well done and works well with the match.

Extras consist of wrestlers commenting on what they think about Austin. Some of the people that talked were The Rock, Jim Ross, Triple H, Jeff Jarrett, and Road Dogg.  You also get 5 segments that involved Austin; this includes Dr. Austin and Austin throwing Rock's Intercontinental Championship into a river. You also get a bunch of extras from previous Austin titles like Austin 3:16 and `Cause Stone Cold said so. Finally, you will get a little extra DVD that shows a little past Backlash 99; It even shows clips from the infamous Over the Edge 1999.

This is an okay DVD. WWE put out a lot of period pieces around this time and they are fun to watch when you get bored. I think the fact that this DVD has no extra matches, but is full of parts from other DVDs, is the reason I give this 3 stars.",1214179200,,2612,5.827225130890052
7889338,4,6305454299,"Stone Cold is followed for 3 days and during this filming of him mostly in his truck driving, We see highlights of matches, As well as highlights of the infamous Austin-Mcmahon feud. This was a very entertaining dvd. The only bad thing about it is that the highlights for the matches should've been a little longer than what they were. But, There were some good special features on this dvd and i think that this may be the 2nd best dvd that the Wwe has done for Austin [2nd only to the stone cold truth].
