2769445,5,B000NJISDE,"Romanticised gypsy camp story, with amazing songs, it;s a must! The story develops in Cartpahians, between Hungary, Ukraine and Romania and it' a Romeo&Juliet type drama, wonderfully written, directed and played
It has been the most watched movie in the comunist block for many years. And for good reasons",1186790400,17,305,5.244897959183674
8178207,3,B000NJISDE,"The story is kind of ""ok"" and personally I did not like the end. The DVD is blurry and does not play in a regular DVD player! It only plays in my dad's stone old laptop with an integrated DVD player.",1524441600,,199,3.8780487804878048
8178208,4,B000NJISDE,"It is a decent copy, considering that is coming from a a time and place where it was difficult to make great recordings.
The charm of the movie and especially the music are still charming after so many years.",1498089600,,208,4.358974358974359
8178209,5,B000NJISDE,"This is a movie that I watched it forty years ago in Eastern Europe.  I have the same feelings like the time I watched there. It is a great movie , besides the romantic gypsies music and stories, it is a small piece a history about that small place common to several nations.",1473811200,,275,4.188679245283019

8178213,5,B000NJISDE,Most people in the US are unfamiliar with this film which is not captioned in English. The musical score alone is worth the purchase. Most of the story can be followed. It is a tragic story told with great cinematographic brushstrokes.,1363564800,,235,4.7560975609756095
8178214,5,B000NJISDE,"I'm told that this was the most watched movie in the communist world, and it's quite likely to be true.  Watching this movie just once is not enough.

Based on the writings of Maxim Gorky, the story is set around the turn of the 20th century, somewhere in Hungarian speaking lands, somewhere near the River Tisza.

The movie is poetry in images, sounds and songs.

It was the ancient-ness of the songs that especially stirred my sense of wonder.  For people with an interest in linguistics, whether as students, professionals or simply as interested amateurs, some of the songs are small treasure troves of linguistic artifacts.  I'm referring to the songs sung in the Romani dialect.

Here are the lyrics of one of the songs, ""Loli Phabay"" (""Red Apple"") and my attempt at a translation in English.  I got no help from ""Google Translate"" as it does not do any Romani dialects.  So please correct me in the comments section so that I can produce an accurate translation ...

Andro verdan drukos nane

=Inside the caravan there is no floor

Mang piramni shukar nane

=A sweet lover of my own I have none

Loli phabay prechinava

=This red apple, I'll cut it

Yek pash tuke, yek pash mange

=One part for you, one part for me.

""Hop hop hop"" is (I think) literally, ""up up up"", meaning ""get up and dance"".

This song, and other songs in the movie, has many variants, each one as charming as the next---you'll find them by doing a quick search on the Internet.",1310860800,10,1456,4.552123552123552
8178215,4,B000NJISDE,"""Gypsies Are Found Near Heaven"" (Tabor ukhodit v nebo) is a Soviet-era movie (filmed in 1975) written and directed Emil Vladimirovich Lotyanu (Loteanu). The film has also been released with the titles ""Queen of the Gypsies"" and ""Gypsies Go to Heaven.""

The film tells the love story between horse thief Zobar (played by Grigore Grigoriu) and the beautiful Gypsy girl Rada (played by Svetlana Andreevna Toma). It is loosely based on various works by Maxim Gorky (e.g. ""Makar Chudra""). Can Zobar sacrifice his beloved Gypsy freedom for his love of Rada?

When it came out, this film was enormously popular in the Soviet Union and around the world. It won the Big Golden Shell at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, the Prize for Best Actress at the Panama International Film Festival, and the Prize for Visual Images at the 11th Congress of UNITEC in Paris.

According to the DVD case, the ""action in the Gypsy camp is set against the background of lifestyle and traditions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's provincial outskirts - the late 19th-century Bessarabia.""

The locations and cinematography (by Sergei Vronsky) are absolutely stunning. The film was shot in the Carpathians, in and around the town of Vinogradova. Some scenes were shot on the old streets of Vilnius. The supporting cast and extra are amazing in their looks, charisma, and energy. According to the interviews on the DVD, most of the supporting cast are Gypsies.

Overall, the musical score of the film (by Yevgheny Doga) is beautiful. There are quite a few song and dance numbers in this film, just like a Bollywood (Indian) movie. Personally, I did not like it when characters would suddenly break into a song (the first time there was a musical number, I almost stopped watching the film). Apparently, I am alone in this reaction, because most people seem to adore these musical numbers. One of the favorite songs from this film is ""I Split the Red Apple"" (a.k.a. Hop, Hop, Hop).

Extras on the DVD include a biography of Maxim Gorky, filmographies, photos, and interviews with lead actress Svetlana Toma and composer Yevgheny Doga.

The DVD has both English subtitles and English dubbing. While the dubbing matches up nicely with lip movements, the spoken translation is not as accurate as the written translation of the subtitles. It is much, much better when you listen to the original language soundtrack. The English subtitles are excellent, much better than machine translations that seem to be used for today's movies.",1275091200,11,2509,5.016826923076923
8178216,5,B000NJISDE,"I bought the movie dvd through Amazon.com. It was everything I expected. It's the love story of Radda and Zobar, a romanticised tale of 19th century Carpathian or Russian Gypsies. I like it best in it's original Russian with English subtitles, which can be selected once you insert the dvd.

I discovered the movie by browsing YouTube, searching for old gypsy photos and music,  [...]

Of course, I was totally blown away and absolutely fascinated by all the related videos, especially those from the movie Gypsies Are Found Near Heaven (also known as Platoon goes to Heaven or Gypsies Camp goes to Sky) [...]

You can preview the various videos on youtube, then buy the dvd through Amazon and enjoy!",1253577600,9,700,4.808333333333334
