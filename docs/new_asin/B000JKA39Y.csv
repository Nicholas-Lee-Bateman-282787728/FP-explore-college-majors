8151518,1,B000JKA39Y,"This show caught my eye when looking searching for Ghost Hunters DVD's so I checked it out on YouTube.  The creator of the show has posted full episodes and it is a compete joke, top to bottom.  If you like Ghost Hunters, you will not like this.

Stay away",1283990400,11,256,4.183673469387755
8151519,1,B000JKA39Y,"I had the misfortune of actually sitting through this travesty called ""Haunted Investigators"", and right off the bat, you'll notice that everything reeks of laziness and poor quality. Not just the show itself, but literally EVERYTHING from the box design, inserts, DVD itself, literally everything. Since the creators obviously didn't put too much effort into making this, I too shall not waste any more of my time reviewing this. Avoid it like a plague.",1270857600,20,454,5.148648648648648
8151520,1,B000JKA39Y,"The premise has Chris Bores, a Buddhist Priest named Alan Cicco (yes Buddhism has Priests) and Bores' (Ex-)Girlfriend Jennifer Schippel go around haunted locations attempting to find ghosts. I will say without hesitation that Ghost Hunters is far more entertaining then this driveled excuse for a show. Its hard to take anything they say seriously.

There are many stupid moments they call ""unexplained instances"", these include Bores' camera shutting off for no reason or Alan tripping over a staircase believing an invisible force pushed him. Iam surprised amazon even sells this crap. Basically what you get is poorly made DVD-R discs of a ghost hunting show knock-off inside a shoddy case.

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BORE FEST!!",1262995200,22,730,5.177966101694915

8151522,1,B000JKA39Y,"This show is of a lower quality and the discs are sub standard quality, DVD-Rs (burned discs), in cheap thin packs with color laser copied inserts. I purchased this show and it didn't work on my Sony 200 Disc DVD player because it was a burned disc - I had to return it to Amazon.[...]. People who are thinking about purchasing this DVD should know that it is not as good as others out there. In this recession, save your money.",1235779200,31,428,4.296296296296297
8151523,4,B000JKA39Y,"I am a huge fan of Ghost Hunters and the TAPS team, and quite honestly was expecting the Haunted Investigators DVDs to be on the same level.  Not quite, but they get an 'A' for effort.  My main complaint is that you only get two episodes per DVD 'volume', and the second episodes are really just cast offs of investigations that produced no evidence, not to mention they are very short in length.  There are three investigators on this team, one is a Buddhist priest, and they do a really admirable job.  They seem to get good EVP's, but not much visual evidence.  And to be honest, isn't one of the reasons we all love TAPS is the soap opera relationships between the investigators themselves?  Here we have three insipid yet likeable individuals who don't squabble, date each other (not that I know of) or incite our interest beyond their ghostly outings.  And that's okay, as long as they keep capturing interesting EVP's.  They seem to have a pretty good rapport with the spiritual realm and can even incite a few spirits to do tricks for them, i.e., tap on walls, answer their questions, etc.  I do recommend these DVD's even though they don't contain enough episodes for my liking, but to the Haunted Investigator's credit, they leave me wanting more.",1176508800,15,1257,4.65158371040724
8151524,5,B000JKA39Y,"I took a chance and thought this would be a cheesy show and not good at all but I'm glad I took a chance. This show turned out to be really good. They found alot of evidence and took a real critical eye to it.

After purchasing the dvd, I noticed they had a website. For people who are not sure if they want to buy it, go to their website, they've got all kinds of video clips and long previews from the dvd and more. Very good.",1163462400,14,428,3.8636363636363638
