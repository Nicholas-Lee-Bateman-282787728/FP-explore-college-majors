638433,3,6303410170,"This is the last of 10 films featuring the Kettle clan, perhaps there should have been 9.  The second film without Percy Kilbride, this one introduces Parker Fennelly as the replacement Pa.  While he does well in  this role, after 8 Kilbride  films, casting another actor in his role was a  bad idea.  Also, the film lacks the touch of Charles Lamont as director,  who helped create the truly classic Kettle films.  This film is interesting  as the final Kettle film, the only one with Pa played by someone other than  Percy Kilbride, and Marjorie Main's last film.  The story is mildly  entertaining, but suffers from simplicity, and a reliance upon the comedic  legacy of previous Kettle films.",962409600,13,696,4.796610169491525

7845495,3,6303410170,"Ma & Pa Kettle was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and  Saturday afternoon TV wasn't ALL sport. Just seeing them in their  'ultra-modern' new home brings back great memories. Pa Kettle is great as  the man who wants to do nothing married to the hardest working housewife in  the world with too many kids to count.  As with all of these movie series  from the 40's and 50's this starts on a high and gradually slides downhill,  losing the stars as it goes on (so nothing has changed there). The first  couple of movies can be watched over and over, but I think the last one  could probably be filed after one viewing.",968371200,12,627,4.245762711864407
