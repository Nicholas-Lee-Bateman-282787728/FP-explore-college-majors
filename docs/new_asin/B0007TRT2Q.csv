8208674,5,B0007TRT2Q,"I was excited, even suprised to see a DVD release of a concert that one of my favorite musicians had staged in 2001, at St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. I try to keep track of The Gathering Concert Series, and I still feel that this is one of the more important events that a fan of ambient and electronic music should attend. Chuck van Zyle (of Star's End radio program) single handedly keeps these events alive, and the CD and DVD start out with an introduction to electronic space music. I have been listening to Kit Watkins most of my life, since his early performances with Happy the Man (once a local band where I came from) and then as a duo with drummer, Coco Roussel. If you have heard some of Kit's solo material, then you know what I am talking about. If you have not, then this DVD release may be an excellent place for you to start collecting this highly unique catalogue of experimental/progressive music.

Kit had given up touring after a short stint with Camel in the mid '80s to work in his private studio in Linden, Virginia. This was his first concert in many years...I was not disappointed. For one man to put on a muti-layered highly planned musical event such as this, it took not only courage, but hours and hours of practice and dedication. Kit uses digital recording devices to play back short performances on percussion and keyboards, and then improvises on an electronic clarinet, while bringing the loops in and out of the composition at will. The lighting was modest but interesting, and the camera was defined and steady, not jerky like some hand held recordings I've seen of concerts. While some of these pieces sounded like some of his later releases, all the material was fresh and prepared exclusively for this concert performance. It was a well documented show, and the DVD runs for 115 minutes (the audio companion of the same name is on 2 CDs). For me, it was like being there. I thoroughly enjoyed every note, every movement that Kit executed, and if he ever does another concert like this one, I highly recommend trying to attend!",1168646400,,2071,4.612466124661246
