Over the years they worked with Andy Williams, Jerry Lewis, jack Benny, and Perry Como to name a few. Also covers their time in Branson, and appearances in California and Las Vegas. Interviews with Andy Williams and Kathie Lee Gifford are so nice, and show they keep their friends personal and showbusiness ones for a lifetime. Their stunning harmonies as they sing are wonderful to hear. You Go To My Head is divine, when they are paired with Henry Mancini playing piano. Personally I have loved these girls since I heard them sing Sad Movies Always Make Me Cry. Lennon Sisters fans will like this the most.",1407628800,,798,4.8321167883211675
