1643580,2,B00005PJ70,"The successor to the original Video Essentials was a long time coming. The new version suffers from the same flaws as the original: poor layout and access on the disc, very poor explanation in the narration, almost non-existant explanation in the liner notes, and consequently difficult-to-interpret test patterns. The narration is at times pompous and unduly technical--who is he trying to impress? I suppose that if you are already a set-up technician, none of the above matters, but I consider myself to know more about the technical side of audio and video than most consumers and had a very hard time making sense of even the basic adjustment instructions.

 Just a few for instances involving the basic test patterns for adjusting brightness, contrast, color, and hue: the narration is terribly unclear as to whether proper adjustment leaves the outermost black bars on the pluge-plus-bars pattern just barely visible or not. Then, after the narration tells you that the pluge pattern is not useful for adjusting non-CRT displays such as my plasma, it does not immediately follow the pluge with an appropriate pattern for adjusting non-CRT screens, referring the user to another chapter for discussion of that. When you get to that other chapter, the explanation of how to use the ramped gray scales is amazingingly ambiguous; for one thing, the reference to the 100% points is unclear because the ramps are not labeled. Then, on the new test pattern used on DVE to adjust color and hue, there is no explanation as to which of the bars and patches are to be adjusted for color and which for hue--again a lack of on-screen labeling or narrative explanation.

HDTV and running across this product on-line by chance,I figured...what the heck? Well, just got it/watched it today. The commentary part is basic stuff that most folks know.  Then...you get several audio (followed by video) test tones and patterns thrown at you.  I know about pink noise, white noise etc., but like several other reviews, ""Where the heck are the instructions on what to do with them ?  I know the basics of the audio tests, but I feel bad for anyone else who isn't ""into"" this stuff.  What were these people thinking ? (I promptly e-mailed DVD Int'l with these same comments/questions and hope to get a response and reasonable explanation. The only review I read before buying exclaimed ""easy to navigate"".  Like other reviewers stated....this product is terrible to navigate through.
I'm not very keen on any of the video patterns. The ""gray color"" card....What the heck do I do with it ??? What the heck do I do with ANY of the video test patterns ?  Do I adjust my dvd player ? TV ?  It really aggravates me that they leave you hanging out there with no explanation or instruction. I'm sure this disc is pure gold to a technician or professional set-up folks.  However, while I would venture to say that I know about ten times more about A/V systems that most of my friends, watching this disc left me feeling like an idiot.  In my e-mail to the company I even said ""Just tell me I'm an idiot and completely missed a section/chapter...I can deal with that"".  I decided to come to this site to see what others had to say.  I now see that I'm certainly not alone.  I would even venture to guess that some of the ""pro"" review folks might be a little less than forthright when claiming how great this disc is.  Either trying to stroke their own egos or they're certainly waaaay ahead of this humble soul.  Maybe I'm just getting old :-).  For the guy who said his Yamaha A/V system wouldn't read the supposed DTS....you need to get it checked.  It is in DTS.
Well, I've always been VERY pleased with my current systems, but I'm always open to any possibilities to make them better. I did learn one thing !  I never really thought about the color of the wall behind the screen.  However, my main system doesn't need/want any ambient light around or behind it so it's a moot point !  :-)  I guess I'll go back and watch it a few more times.

There seem to be no instructions as to how to use the multitude of test patterns at the end of the disc.

1643587,2,B00005PJ70,"First of all, like most DVD's you are not able to simply navigate this DVD with the Title and Chapter Menu buttons.  No, the author decided in his infinite wisdom to make navigation a chore by accessing a ""Program Menu"" which only after significant effort I was able to finally figure out how to get to point A to point B and even then it required cumbersome navigation and took far too long.  It was really an aggravation and frustrating since my principle concern was not learning how to navigate the damn DVD but learning how to calibrate my system.
After wasting far far too much time figuring out how to navigate through the DVD I then undertook to calibrate my system.  The author's introductory chapters and interesting and informative, BUT he fails to follow up on the initial promise of the DVD by leaving you without adequate instructions on how to use the test tones and video tools.
For instance, he has half right speaker tones, but never explains what in the heck they are for.  After a brief and disappointing intro to both audio and video he simply throws the test tones at you.  Why didn't he have a thorough step by step explanation of exactly how to use them.
The other problem is that he uses terms he does not completely explain or define leaving this user confused and scratching his head.
If you are an expert and know what you are doing then this DVD might be more useful than it was to me.

1643680,4,B00005PJ70,"I bought this video essentials DVD for calibrating my home theater setup, but my first experience using it was to calibrate a big installation in a local library, where we had setup a large scale audio-video system. We used the DVD to calibrate a Panasonic PT-AE3000U projector and a Denon AVR-1609 surround amp hooked up to a Magnavox NB500MB5G blu-ray player. The subwoofer is powered by a separate, 1000-watt amp.

This is a large room, about 40x50 feet, with big speakers in big enclosures (15"" subwoofer and seven big vintage Electrovoice 12"" studio monitor speakers in matching enclosures). The image was projected onto a 16-foot-wide screen. The system had been in operation for several years, but had never been calibrated.

Three of us did the calibrations one evening using the calibration DVD (not the blu-ray version), carefully going through the menus and checking with each other to get a consensus on color and gray scales. I learned a lot doing this since I had little experience with calibrations before this. It took a couple of hours to do this.

A week after the calibrations were done. We showed a movie to members of the public using this system, the blu-ray version of ""Hairspray."" Afterwards, we asked the audience what they thought of the picture and sound. We got rave reviews on everything. We were very pleased with the color, in both the black and white and color movies we tried. The color and gray scales were spot on. The sound was great.

Later, I tried the disk on my own home theater system, which consists of a 5.1 surround system powered by a Sony STR-DH510 surround amp, a Sony BDPS360 blu-ray player, a Polk self-powered subwoofer and an InFocus In76 hi-def video projector. Right off, I noticed the grayscale and color tests did not look the same on the InFocus projector as they did on the much more expensive Panasonic projector. I could see that getting those colors and gray scales right was going to be a lot more difficult. It looks like fine-tuning colors is going to be much harder to do on my home system than it was in that previous calibration experience, so I postponed the calibration to a later date when I have more time to work on them. I also tried calibrating my old RCA CRT TV and I found the gray scale and color calibrations to be much more difficult there as well.

In conclusion, I have to say this disk works great on high-end video and audio systems. I'm not sure about how the tests will work for older and less capable systems since I haven't really tried. It will work on hi-def systems and on sound systems up to DTS 6.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1EX (7-channel). If you have an 8-channel system, (7.1 surround) this disk won't handle that one extra discrete rear channel. Seven channels is as far as it goes for this particular calibration disk.

If your'e an average guy who wants to learn how to do a basic calibration, run away from this disc very quickly.  You will likely suffer an anurism trying to figure out what Joe Kane is trying to do here.  Further, at the time of this writing this disc is really old (close to 10 years), so large portions of the explanations have really outdated pictures/CGI.  You'd probably learn far more about calibration by running the THX Optimizer on Star Wars or the Monster calibration disc.  NB:  The BluRay version of DVE might be better, so maybe check that out.  I hear he explains more stuff, and if he does, this disc might be useful for average folks).

Much of the material toward the beginning of the disc seems to be that way.  There are videos that explain DVD technology, how to setup your room to watch DVDs optimally, how to setup your sound system in very broad, basic terms.  However, later when they explain (some) of the test patterns on the disc, tons of terms, diagrams, and pictures are thrown at the user in short order with very little explanation as to what they mean.  The basic test patterns are explained well enough that someone who sorta followed the directions and re-watched most of the disc *might* get it after the the third time through.

  This disc, in many ways, feels like a highly abbreviated version of a professional training seminar in home theater calibration with the lecture torn into pieces and scattered about on this disc.  Since I'm a bit of an AV geek, and read AV forums quite a bit and peruse many av websites, some of his explanations are helpful (his explanation of color temperature finally helped the concept click in my head), but a lot of the test patterns simply aren't explained in the reference section.  Also, some of his explanations throw out terms that he never explains (like Average Picture Level).

1643708,1,B00005PJ70,"I had previously used a prior version of this that I borrowed from a friend to ""optimize"" my new LCD flatscreen TV.  The explanations, guides and menus were very helpful.  So I decided to purchase this new version, for my dad, to help him do the same with his TV.  They made this latest version completely useless.  Here are a list of pros and cons in no particular order.

Pros:
It's a DVD (DVD players are cheap)

Cons:
Forces you to watch the entire intro (for the DVD and at the beginning of every section) before you can even get to the menu (this was the most annoying).  It does not allow you to fast forward through the ""lecture"" parts to get to the useful information (if you've done this before it gets quite boring very fast.
The menu was very poorly structured and difficult to navigate.  Forces you to guess where certain parts may be, and most have ""lecture"" intros that you cannot back out of in case you're wrong(see prior complaint).
The all the ""useful"" parts (i.e. test screens and other calibration tutorials) for your TV were embedded somewhere within the lectures, which again made it difficult to navigate to (see first complaint).

Ultimately, I was so disgusted/frustrated with this product I sent it back to amazon, without actually using it to calibrate Dad's TV.  Thankfully amazon has such a wonderful return policy that was the most rewarding part of  this whole process (which is actually quite sad).",1219363200,2,1431,4.684
1643719,2,B00005PJ70,"This is a very informative DVD for anyone with an interest in TV calibration and several hours available to spend watching and listening to it.  However, if you just want to calibrate your TV, it is not so helpful and the disk IS NOT user friendly.  It is very, very difficult to navigate through this DVD, even harder to find a specific item, and impossible to go back one section or chapter.

On the plus side, the instructions and graphic for adjusting Brightness are very good and should be useable by anyone in either the User Menu or Service Menu of a modern HDTV.  The instructions and graphics for Contrast, not so much.  Good information on the useless Sharpness control and adequate information and graphics to adjust Color saturation.

Bottom line, if you want a short course in digital video essentials and have time to spare, this is a nice DVD.  If you have some understanding of TV calibration and just want to optimize the settings for your TV, then you will find this DVD very difficult to work with.",1217635200,,1017,4.616666666666666

1643721,5,B00005PJ70,"I used the older Video Essentials with LaserDisc and DVD (separate media) and that original program has very detailed instructions on what to do and how to do it. I bought this newer DVD since it covers flat screens, which the older DVD didn't. Note, this doesn't cover an HD stuff, this is a SD video. This new program is lighter on the details of what to do and the history of NTSC (US version), but they still go into enough details on what to do and how to setup the screen. You do need to spend the time watching the somewhat dry material to learn what to do if you're new to this, but my dad figured it out and he's not very technical with TVs. If you already know what to do you can jump right to the test images... and they now include a 3 color filter vs, the original blue only filter.

They don't mention this anywhere, but you will probably want to purchase a sound level meter to set the audio levels for your surround system correctly if your system amplifier doesn't have it's own level monitoring microphone and test. I got my sound level meter from Radio Shack, the analog one, not the digital one... it's the same as they use in the video and is about $45 as of this writing (4/08).

I've used this DVD on all my TVs and monitors (yes computer monitors benefit from this too for games and movies!). My XBOX360 games look better and my new plasmas and LCDs are now set correctly. Out of the box, the Sharp Aquos 32"" 1080p displays are way too oversaturated and contrasty, although the colors are ok (they still need minor adjustments). The Pioneer Kuro 42"" was pretty good for contrast and colors, but I still lowered the brightness and made some minor adjustments to the colors. My older Pioneer HD1110-Pro was already set correctly since I had used the older Video Essentials with it, but it's a good idea to periodically check as brightness will fade over time for plasmas and LCDs (and CRTs for that matter!) I also found my Dell 24"" widescreens were too bright and too ""warm"", I dialed in a lot of green and dialed back the red. If you plan to use this with your PC monitor(s), make sure you can adjust the individual colors (RGB) to make the most of it.

The other thing that you will want to be aware of is many monitors and TVs have a different settings (color/saturation/brightness/contrast) for each input, so depending on how you have your A/V system setup it might be a bit of work to correctly set everything... but it'll be worth it! I ended up copying the settings from one of the inputs to the cable box input on the TVs and have found color bars being broadcast occasionally to double check the settings.

For new TVs (plasmas and CRTs) you will want to hold off on adjusting the settings until you've used the display for at least 100 hours (but don't just leave the display turned on with a static image since it will ""burn in"" that image into the phosphors).",1209081600,5,2895,4.385474860335195
1643722,4,B00005PJ70,This product is very useful at basic calibration and defining what different components in the tv and menu are for. I would recomment this dvd for anyone that does not want to spend the $300 for professional calibration.,1203379200,,220,4.815789473684211

You don't know what your missing until you have calibrated the picture on your display. This disc has all of the patterns you will need but it does a poor job of walking you through the process. The disc's menu system is not intuitive at all.,1199750400,2,354,4.461538461538462
1643724,1,B00005PJ70,"I was looking for a cheap way to calibrate my new HD tv without having to pay a professional $300 to do it so I went with this dvd. Since the HD versions of these calibate discs arn't out yet, I was stuck with this as being the best choice.

Maybe my tv is just that good and the settings were set pretty much right cause it didn't make much of a difference in the picture quality. The first time going through it, it seemed to have made the picture worse. But I did my own tweaks and fixed it up.

The dvd itself has alot of information about tv's, HD and all this calibrate stuff but if you're not a major techie thats into it, you probably won't care to much about it. It seems to go on and on and just sticking the ""lets calibrate your tv"" parts for a few mins in between all of the long chapters. It doesn't have a section to just go straight to it.

Honestly, I could have done without this. Like i said, didn't make much difference and for what little you get for the price, it wasn't worth it.  Maybe it was cause these tests wern't specificly set up for a HD but it had HD talk in it so it should have been.",1194912000,2,1116,3.96875
1643725,1,B00005PJ70,"After spending two hours with this disc, I have succeeded in adjusting a total of three settings on my TV: Brightness, Color and Sharpness. Has there been an improvement in picture quality? Perhaps; it's a little early to say.

But what's undeniable is that the vast majority of information on this disc is useless to me. It's worth pointing out that, although the introduction mentions modern flat-panel TVs (this disc came out in 2003), all of the tests and information on the disc are actually geared towards CRT or projector TVs. That might have been appropriate five years ago, but even in 2003, plasma and LCD sets were starting to make an appearance and it should have been obvious to a supposed professional like Joe Kane that they were going to become a big presence in the home theater market.

Nonetheless, I followed the advice of those who rank this disk highly, and was prepared to sit down and watch the program from the beginning, since there aren't actually any printed instructions included with the DVD. For the first section -- basic adjustments -- the video was very good; everything was explained clearly, and then I was presented with a test pattern with which to adjust my set.

Unfortunately, once I got past the basic adjustments, everything changed. Instead of continuing with the ""explain/test pattern"" paradigm, the program became nothing but a series of explanations, with no ""break"" for the user to configure his set based on the information he was just given.

To give you an example: In the basic section, there are instructions for how to adjust the contrast on your set, but they are only useable if you have a non-HDTV, because they depend on seeing the scan lines on the screen. The user is told that if he doesn't have a CRT TV with visible scan lines, he will be given instructions on how to adjust the contrast in the ""troubleshooting"" section. In the troubleshooting section, we are given a lot of talk about high-scan-rate CRTs and projector TVs before we finally get to the test pattern. Here, reproduced for your edification, are the complete, verbatim instructions on how to adjust your contrast (I have attempted to upload a screen capture of the test pattern in question which may or may not make any of this more comprehensible):

[EDIT]I've decided to re-type this section to give it a little more impact. It seemed a little hard to read with everything mashed up together.

So, first, I'm presenting, verbatim, the instructions you're supposed to use to adjust the contrast. Then, below that, are my comments, based on my reaction as I watched the video and attempted to follow the instructions.

""In the cases where the brightness control moves the entire video signal up and down within the dynamic range of the digital processor, and the contrast sets the distance between black and white, we need to start by turning the contrast down below the 50% point. Raise and lower the brightness so you'll see the dark parts of the ramp come and go. Set the brightness so that video at black[?] just disappears into the background of the image. Now, increase the contrast control while looking back at the dark parts of the picture for a shift in black level. Reset the brightness control as this shift begins to take place. Gradually increase the contrast, re-setting the brightness control as needed, to a point where the white begins to clip above the 100% marker.""

Here are my comments on this section:

- ""In the cases where the brightness control moves the entire video signal up and down within the dynamic range of the digital processor, and the contrast sets the distance between black and white, we need to start by turning the contrast down below the 50% point.""
[How do we determine if your TV even has the brightness and contrast controls described?? Who knows; let's plow ahead anyway!]

- ""Raise and lower the brightness so you'll see the dark parts of the ramp come and go.""
[""Come and go""? What is that supposed to mean? The dark parts are dark. They get darker and lighter depending on the brightness control, but they're always part of the image. How is the amateur user supposed to make sense of an imprecise description like ""come and go""? And when are we supposed to stop adjusting the brightness? When the dark parts ""come"" or when they ""go""?]

- ""Set the brightness so that video at black ... ""
[Huh? What does ""video at black"" mean? I wasn't even sure what the narrator was trying to say until I listened to this sentence five or ten times. Is ""video at black"" different from ""black portions of the screen""? What's with all the vague language all of a sudden?]

- "" ... just disappears into the background of the image.""
[Again, I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. I don't even know which part of the image is supposed to be the ""background"". The black parts of the pattern are black. What is the fine distinction that is supposed to indicate that the ""video at black"" has ""disappeared into the background""?]

- ""Now, increase the contrast control while looking back at the dark parts of the picture for a shift in black level.""
[A ""shift in black level""? Again, what is that supposed to mean to an amateur?]

- ""Reset the brightness control as this shift begins to take place.""
[Reset it how? Brighter or darker? And how do we know when we've adjusted it enough, in whichever direction we're supposed to be adjusting it?]

- ""Gradually increase the contrast, re-setting the brightness control as needed, to a point where the white begins to clip above the 100% marker.""
[The white begins to ""clip""? What on earth does that mean? I know what ""clipping"" means in an audio amplifier, but how am I supposed to know if a color is ""clipping""? And what the heck is the ""100% marker""? There are no text markers of any kind on this test pattern!]""

To make matters worse, at the end of this long-winded, quickly-read set of instructions, we are not given a test pattern to work on! I finally figured out that I was supposed to listen to the explanations, then (I guess) jump ahead to the ""reference materials"" (after having memorized the instructions) and find the test pattern that I needed, then jump back to wherever I was in the ""Troubleshooting"" or ""Advanced Settings"" section. Not only was this extremely tedious, given the poorly-designed menus on this disc, but the explanations became increasingly long-winded (and decreasingly helpful) as the disc went on.

As we get into the ""Advanced Instructions"" section, we are given an extremely detailed (and tedious) description of how television standards determine the proper value for ""grey"", but no more than ten seconds' worth of useful information on how to adjust this on our sets (it basically boils down to ""use this settings if you're watching color, and a different setting if you're watching black & white""). By the end of the video, the author has given up on giving us any calibration information at all, and simply recites information on component output, MPEG encoding, interlaced and progressive video, and similar subjects that are covered in much more informative treatments on the internet.

Once the program is over, you are left with dozens of test patterns and test videos on the disc without a single shred of information on how they were intended to be used. I counted fifty different test patterns that have no explanation whatsoever, plus a series of audio/video ""Demonstrations"" that, again, come without any description of what the user is supposed to be looking for.

I've come to the conclusion that in spite of the DVD case copy describing this disc as ""the 'TV Guy' of the 21st Century', most of the material contained on this disc is, in fact, intended for use by a trained professional, and not an amateur TV owner. The numerous references to hiring a professional to calibrate your TV -- and the convenient link to a website where you can do so! -- reinforced this impression.

Finally, my review would not be complete without describing how extremely poor the menus are. The narrator takes great pride in pointing out (during the introduction) that you can always get back to the main menu (even if your remote doesn't have a ""Title"" or ""Top Menu"" button) because there is always a ""Program Menu"" link on every sub-menu.

In fact, this is a lie. There are actually two or three levels of sub-menus, and some have the ""Program Menu"" and some don't. In some cases, the first page of a sub-menu section has the ""Program Menu"" link and the rest don't. On the ones that do, the ""Program Menu"" link takes you back to the very top of the menu structure, so you then have to drill through a confusing series of options (""DVD Navigation"", ""Program Guide"", ""Title Index"", etc.) to get back to where you were.

Astonishingly, there is even one option (""DVD Navigation"") where clicking on the link takes you to a video that LOOKS LIKE a menu! So you literally can't tell (until the narrator starts speaking) whether you are watching part of the video or looking at a menu.

Unfortunately, that's all-too-typical of the confusing approach and lack of attention to detail that characterizes this entire product. I own a state-of-the-art LCD TV set and high-quality DVD player and maybe 2%-5% of this DVD is actually useful to me. I'm wishing I had saved my money until a new version of Avia comes out.",1186012800,51,9349,4.736162361623617

1643727,4,B00005PJ70,"The Digital Video Essentials DVD is a great tool for helping you set up your home theater.  Many of the reviews for DVE will have you believe that the menus are difficult to navigate and that much of the information within the DVD is without explanation.  I can certainly say that my experience with DVE was a very positive one.

I believe the trick to unlocking the full potential of DVE is to be patient.  The narrator suggests that you go step-by-step through the DVD.  I highly suggest this.  Doing so allowed me to fully understand what each of the test patterns was used for and how to properly use them.  For a first-time DVE viewer it is very helpful to have these explanations.  Later on, when you've sat through the program once, you can use the menu system to jump directly to the test pattern you need.

Navigating the extensive menu system will seem daunting at first, but again, if you follow the narration from the beginning the menu system is clearly explained.  After listening to this explanation, I had no trouble navigating the menus to find any specific title or chapter I wanted.

Like many other reviewers, I'm my family's ""go to"" person when it comes to setting up home theater equipment.  Even so, Digital Video Essentials taught me a thing or two.  Now, instead of simply knowing how to adjust the settings, I know why I am adjusting them.  I find this to be very beneficial when working to get that perfect setup.

In the end, Digital Video Essentials isn't a ""magic bullet"" that will do everything for you.  Likewise it isn't very useful for someone who is not already familiar with the material and who does not have the patience to sit through the program's narration.  What DVE is however, is an effective tool for helping you to get that ""perfect setup"" while learning why you're making the adjustments to your setup.

1643750,4,B00005PJ70,"Wanting to use up a gift card from Christmas, I decided to purchase the AVIA disc. However, since it cost more than I had left on the card, and not wanting to spend any of my own money, I settled on this instead. I was hesitant to buy it, since I heard about how difficult it is to use and navigate. However, with the small amount of adjusting I wanted to do - and a little help from Google - this disc made a fine inexpensive way to calibrate my TV.

To start off, the shuttle launch footage is possibly the best part of the disc. It's seriously the best-looking DVD material I've seen, and the filmmaker deserves major props for the effort. For those who only care about the test patterns and such, this layman worked through the admittedly obtuse menu system well enough to do a simple tune-up of my TV's picture. I haven't done anything with the audio tests, since I have two cheapo computer speakers as my sole source of sound, so I have nothing to say about them. I also didn't go through the video tutorials on the disc, which may have helped me navigate the disc. As it was, I did an Internet search to find out how to use this product.

Would I recommend DVE to the average person with a small to nonexistent home theater setup? Yes, if they did their research, knew their video equipment well, and didn't expect to do more than a dozen or so of the tests on the disc. Even minor calibration is better than none at all. Undoubtedly, advanced users should know better what to do with this software, and it seems comprehensive enough that it could give someone a top-notch user calibration.",1171670400,11,1597,4.373737373737374

1643752,5,B00005PJ70,"A very good product.  But its not ""turnkey"".  You first have to familiarize yourself with the menu, which is not as intuitive as one might wish for but is easy to navigate once you've used it a couple of times.

The audio tests are ok and you don't really need a sound meter. You are, after all, setting the audio parameters according to your personal preferences as impacted by the acoustical properties of your room.

The AVIA tests provide nominal audio settings that can be used as the default setting which can be tweaked by ear to compensate for personal and/or acoustical factors, including the characteristics of the recording.  Since audio characteristics often vary from disc to disc, many adjust the default setting, accordingly. Many AV systems have a memory that permits you to save a fair number of your favorite settings.

The video tests are worth the price, alone.  I ran them several times over the course of a week, and found that my visual perception improved each time and I was able to produce a picture quality that I didn't know was possible, even though I'd been shopping for a new TV and comparing picture quality for quite some time.

The bottom line is that most  factories don't set TV video to optimum quality.  The contrast and color are set much too high which blankets the image's subtleties.  The settings obtained with the AVIA disc and blue transparency, enhanced the picture to a super fine quality.  The picture is crisper, the colors have more real contrast and distinguishable depth and have a more nuanced quality that shows up the metallic colors that I had not seen before, and even yet on most of the TVs displayed in stores.

By going to different sections repeatedly I was able to adjust the blacks & grays then go back and tweak the colors so that people look sort of real (what do I know, like most guys I'm a ""bit"" blue/green color blind).  For the $17 investment I can't really complain and I still like the ""Sport"" setting to blast the colors for football but I was able to set up a general ""Preference"" setting for normal HDTV viewing.

There are test patterns on the disc for all levels of experience.  I am ISF certified and have test equipment to go into the service menues and do a full calibration.  There was a low brightness problem on the old DVD and it has been corrected in DVE.  The menue system is a little tough to navigate, but once you figure it out, you can jump right to where you need to be.  The only real problem with this isn't with the disc but the procedure.  If you seting up the input for your DVD player then this will work great, but if your trying to setup for your HDTV input the only real way to do that is to have the test patterns supplied by your TV provider. The decoder in your HDTV receiver is the output device and not the DVD player, so it will have different charachteristics then the DVD output signal.  Just like no 2 dvd players will lead you to the same settings, neither will satalite/cable boxes.  The other guy who thought that the factory dynamic setting was the best might be experienceing this problem, but most likely he just wasted money on this DVD becasue he doesn't really want correct settings, just brighter ones.  Most folks will find out that their equipment isn't up to par and also might have some kind of resentment after using this.

I think of myself as an audiophile, have an aperion audio 7.1 system, with a high end onkyo receiver.

The onlyo does not have an automatic tuning system, so I need to configure the levels for the speakers manually.

So I have used this DVD to set it up

I liked the audio setup. I re-do the tuneup every few months.

You can really feel the difference before/after. 5 stars here.

--

I've also used the video setup, to tune the colors of my HD TV, but  often go back to the TVs own settings.

The ""custom"" setting I create help only for some movies.

But the TV's dynamic mode, seems best for a majorty of shows/movies. 4 stars here.

---

As other readers said, very,very difficult to navigate. I found the easiest way is to go back to main menu and then navigate. 2 stars here

---

Still a good DVD to have.

I thought I could use the DVD myself to touch up the image every couple of years.  What a mistake!  If you are a professional who has had someone teach you how to use it, then you can use it.  If you are an average individual or above average like me (or below average...) forget it.  The DVD provides plenty of still images to adjust contrast and colors, but you have no idea what to do.  For example, the red color bar has several different shades of color.  But, what are you supposed to do?  There are no instructions and no narration.  Are you supposed to adjust the color until they are all the same? Are you supposed to adjust the contrast until they are the same?  Are they supposed to be different shades that you fine tune?  Who knows!  This is how all of the tools on the DVD work.  So, unless you have been trained how to use the tools, don't buy this.  I wasted hours trying to figure it out.

Frankly, I think that the DVE-set picture looked worse, so I changed the settings back to my manually-set ones.  So, in a way, I don't think the disc is really necessary if you are patient enough to play around for a few days adjusting the picture as you go along.

The information included on the DVD is generally not that useful and is largely out of date.  A lot of the previous reviews are correct in that the menu system is unnecessarily complicated, and there are a lot of extra test patterns included with no instructions on how to use them.

It's difficult to attach percentages, but this is the best way to get across the improvements this DVD can help bring.  The biggest difference this helps with is in picture noise/pixelation.  It does a really good job of cleaning up artifacts you don't want.  The problem with the DVD is that it is difficult to find the wizard to use for the calibration.  I can't even write the instructions for how to get to it because I don't know/can't recall how I finally found it.  But when you do, even a novice can calibrate their TV and notice the improvements.
