It is Italian audio only and Italian subtitles only...  So while you may be able to play it with your DVD player, you better know Italian to enjoy it.",1440547200,,298,4.462962962962963

They were the bests and they still are!! I had to get this"" hard to find"" film from him as I'm trying to get them all. I wasn't disappoint with this one....

Nicola decides to spy on his wife one day and wants to surprise her while she's out shopping. As he does so, he realise that his wife is in another man's arm. Angry, he then decide to leave and confront her later at home. They get into a huge fight ending with Nicola being stab by his furious wife but nothing to serious. As he leaves the house after the fight, someone comes in the house and stab her with the same ice pick he got stab with when arguing with his wife. The police then immediately accuse Nicola for the murder. Nicola , who was unaware of the murder at the time will ask his long time friend Ana for help. Ana will then try to convince the police that Nicola is innocent and that the murder of his wife may have been committed byan old serial killer named Franco Tribbo, who supposedly died 8 years ago in a fire.....

This is a good story!, maybe a bit simple for casual modern horror fans but should definitely please any Italian horror fans. Cinematography is awesome as always with Bava, very unique in its own way!! There is lots of suspense and action too and you should be in it for the whole ride once you start the movie!
Just be careful if your interested in buying this one...it may require a region 2 DVD player or region free. There is no extra's or anything on the DVD but its ok, i'll complain about it when they release an English version...BTW....what the hell are they waiting for ?......there used to be one because it was called ""The midnight killer"" or ""you'll die at midnight"" originally released in America in 1986 but i think those copies are all VHS or they're all gone already...its just too bad...anyway....have some fun!!!

ENJOY!!!!!",1325635200,,1993,4.422343324250681
