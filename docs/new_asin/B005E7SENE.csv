8467958,5,B005E7SENE,DVD selection covering all the front in the pacific in WWII. Any body wanting to know more about this subject should look into buying. The most interesting portion is the pre and post WW II coverage.,1526601600,,199,4.555555555555555
8467959,5,B005E7SENE,Wonderful.  The same as when I watched it as a youth.,1507420800,,53,3.8181818181818183
8467960,5,B005E7SENE,"Very well done. This is the complete, 26-episode television series from 1951. Quality is excellent, Westbrook Van Voorhis's mellifluous narration, if somewhat self-conscious, is remarkably clear (although one very soon gets tired  of the military-chorale theme music!), and despite the heavily-propagandized presentation, the immediacy of the documentary provides some fine history.",1504051200,,382,6.490196078431373
8467961,5,B005E7SENE,"Excellent series, well worth the time and money. Turned right around and ordered Crusade in Europe.",1483488000,,99,5.25
8467962,4,B005E7SENE,"Excellent program.  Transfer to DVD is good from 1950's era B&W 16mm film.  Optical sound from Original film contains some pops and crackle from film age and scratches.  But, overall about what you'd expect.",1441584000,,207,5.029411764705882
8467963,5,B005E7SENE,"this was worth getting for the final disc. What a great synopsis of the aftermath of wwII in the countries which were least involved in the war. Asia, China, all the islands and such more affected by Japan during the war had not been discussed on any of the other documentaries id seen, get it if for nothing but disc 6. All very basic stuff but for someone who really knows little of the history it was a nice introduction/overview.",1441497600,,433,4.425
8467964,5,B005E7SENE,Great book!,1430697600,,11,5.0
8467965,4,B005E7SENE,"Produced in the 1950's, this series of 26 approximately 30 minute episodes covers the U.S. war with Japan beginning before Pearl Harbor; starting with the rise of Japanese imperialism that grew after World War I, growing with the invasion of China and other Asian countries and ultimately culminating with defeat due to the use of the atomic bomb against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  I chose this 6-disc release from MPI Home Video rather than the other companies as the quality of discs, the packaging and the videos themselves seemed to be superior.  I was not disappointed.  Of course, the quality of audio and video does not compare with modern material but it is still quite good.  The quality of the narration, in terms of being loaded with facts, while still maintaining an emotional quality of compassion and thoughtfulness, is very good and is quite superior to other WWII documentaries (Victory At Sea, for example).  A good addition to anyone's video library.",1390262400,10,966,5.0125
8467966,2,B005E7SENE,"The footage is good, but the narration (and music) sounds too much like propaganda. It was released in 1951, so that might help explain the narration.

The footage is not organized: Similar topics are repeated in each episode.

Very often the story is dictated by the available film clips rather than the other way around. Sometimes the narrative wanders off topic simply because of the available film footage. Sometimes facts do surface and are interesting, but it can be difficult to wait for them.

I watched Part 1, started to watch Part 2, watched the beginning of Part 3, and then decided to turn it off.

You can watch the series on youtube; just search for ""Crusade in the Pacific"".
