8233178,4,B000YKI4NG,I love this video as a teaching tool for teaching the history of forensics.  It integrates a lot of great historical events and how they have been analyzed by science and how the cases were solved.  The only negative aspect is the age of the video and many of the events are way outdated now.,1391644800,,292,4.290909090909091
8233179,2,B000YKI4NG,"This started off with Sherlock Holmes and covered a lot of infamous criminals.  I assumed that it would be about tools: fingerprints, Luminol, DNA, etc.  However, this focused on how famous cases involved forensic tools.  This isn't your typical episodes.  It doesn't have the typical narrator.  It isn't has flashy in its filming.  I kinda wonder if another studio did it and History Channel just paid to glue their logo on top of it.  Near the end, there's a LOOOONG factual discussion about DNA and I thought it was a bit boring.  I thought this would compliment the amazing show ""Forensic Files,"" but it doesn't.",1336089600,,616,4.8
