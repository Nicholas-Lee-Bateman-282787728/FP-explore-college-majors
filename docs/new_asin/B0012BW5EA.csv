8245011,2,B0012BW5EA,"This program is VERY short.  One of the two bonus features was longer than it.  It also didn't provide any information that I didn't know.  Still, for those who like to hear information, rather than read it, than this may be for them.  The work refers viewers to archives, websites, and book that can help with their genealogical search.  The work speaks softly about an important subject: IF YOUR ANCESTOR WAS NOT ON ONE OF THE OFFICIAL ROLES, THEN YOU CANNOT BECOME A TRIBAL MEMBER!  Photos and testimonies about a relative ""looking Indian"" won't suffice.  I also have never heard that the Eastern or Western Bands would accept the new DNA technology that can pinpoint your ethnic ancestry.
What upset me is the special features section in which a chief gave a state of the union address.  It started off fairly.  However, the leader then went on to rail against ""hostile Congressmen"" who won't let the tribe have self-determination.  This is a veiled mention of the Cherokee Freedman, Black individuals who have been living with the tribe since the tribe emancipated their slave ancestors.  The Freedmen have said the Cherokee Nation signed treaties saying the Freedman would be given full rights.  The attack on Congressmen was directed toward the Congressional Black Caucus, a progressive group that has fought not only for African Americans, but all people of color and other oppressed groups.  As an African American, I was saddened hearing the vitriol in the chief's voice.  For Blacks who claim ties to the Cherokee, either genetically or culturally, this work may truly be disheartening.
I don't know why a disc that could have been entirely positive went down this funky and controversial role.  I left watching this work a much sadder person.  I can't recommend this to others with a full endorsement.",1256860800,5,1813,4.953642384105961
