8647366,1,B000059WK8,"I have watched a version of this DVD previously.  So I purchased the DVD from Amazon for my personal video library.  I was so excited and anxious when the DVD arrived.  However, to my great disappointment, the DVD is not for the region in the United States.

The DVD came for Region 2 and United States is Region 1.  This is the first time I have ever had to deal with Region setting for a DVD.  Greater attention should be made for selling items in the US with such issues as regions for other countries.",1298332800,,505,4.2631578947368425
