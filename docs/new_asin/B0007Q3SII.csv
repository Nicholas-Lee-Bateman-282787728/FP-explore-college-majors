2230889,5,B0007Q3SII,"This documentary is based upon Peter Schweitzer's book, Reagan's War. It is truly a moving account of recent history. It candidly portrays the tyranny of will to power as it arose from concepts forged by Nietsche, Hegel, Marx, and others, and as it took form by Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, and others throughout the 20th century.

The documentary makes it explicitly clear that Ronald Reagan challenged the Neville Chamberlain-like approach that U.S. Presidents from Harry Truman through Jimmy Carter had adopted toward the Sovient Union, the appeasement policy of containment. The movie reminds us, who lived through the Cold War, how close the U.S. came to the brink of nuclear war with the U.S.S.R. many times because none of the leaders dared to face down the foe, including President Kennedy during the ""Cuban Missle Crisis."" He pulled a backroom deal with Nikita Krushchev sacrificing Turkey to get the Soviet Union out of the U.S. face in Cuba.

President Reagan took on Communinism and Communists when he became President of the Screen Actors Guild and in a major way when he became President of the United States. The story discloses how KGB documents reinforce the enormous significance of President Reagan's actions and decisions during his two terms as President. THough at first mocking him as a ""cowboy actor,"" those in the Kremlin came to respect President Reagan for his fearless posture and his disdain for weakness, for accommodating the enemy, and for making deals. The movie unveils the story of a man whose resolve of purpose, whose determined strategy of ""peace through strength,"" whose unflinching courage to stand up to threats, whose selfless dedication to the preservation and expansion of freedom before self glory, and whose belief that God had spared his life from the assassin's designs to bring reality to his visionary ideals did in fact transform the world that is powerfully and symbolically represented in the destruction of the Berlin Wall. In the Face of Evil is the account of how the Cold War was won without firing a shot and the enormous role that President Reagan filled to secure that victory.

Whatever your political persuasion may be, you ought to acknowledge greatness when you see it. View In the Face of Evil and you will see greatness. Then thank God that he raised up Ronald Reagan and spared his life to slay the Beast of tyranny known as Communism, and then pray for President Bush that he will continue to walk in President Reagan's footsteps and never give aid and comfort to the enemy of freedom.",1118793600,5,2558,4.97196261682243
2230890,5,B0007Q3SII,"If you want to watch a documentary from before the 2004 election, this one far out-strips the others (sorry, Michael Moore). A wonderful portrayal of one of the greatest of all Americans, this film carries you from the evil of Hitler and Nazi Germany, through the rise and fall of Communism. The film makes the case that President Reagan was the only one who had the courage to take a decisive stand against the Communists (and gives you evidence which will lead you to the same conclusion)and shows how Communism was collapsed and was defeated. The film is full of biblical and apocalyptic overtones (which those of us who lived during the Cold War era will find warranted)as well as bits of quotes and speeches from Reagan which are riveting. While the film was obviously made by pro-Reagan filmmakers, it does not gloss over the problems that he encountered during his presidency and life. Still the focus is the strength and bravery of this great American, and the level of patriotism that his life, word, and deed calls each American to today. Wonderful!",1118361600,13,1059,4.7923497267759565
2230891,5,B0007Q3SII,"In the Face of Evil is an excellent film that explains the little known facts of Ronald Reagan's life long fight against the great evil of the late Twentieth Century, communism. Despite some's view that Reagan accidentally brought down the USSR or that he just happened to be in Office when communism lost its grip on the world, In the Face of Evil exposes the faultiness in those theories. It also shows that Reagan had developed this ideas for defeating communism long before he ever reached the White House. His actions here not spur of the moment thoughts, they were well developed due to his extensive dealings with communism from his early days in Hollywood. It also shows the remarkable consistency with which Reagan viewed communism and the threat it posed. Reagan actions were not based on polls, they were founded on his unshakable view that communism was evil, it was a threat, and it needed to be ended, not tolerated. Despite whatever your views or beliefs, this is a film that you must see.",1117238400,16,1004,4.742857142857143
2230892,5,B0007Q3SII,"I purchased In the Face of Evil a few months ago and I have watched it at least four times.  Each viewing inspires me as much as the first time.  The 20th century's historical background, the succinct and staccato narration, the relevant musical score and the explanation of Reagan's tactical plan to dismantle the Soviet Union are just awesome.  The footage of Reagan's eloquent speeches from the 1960s and 1970s are essential to  understanding that he had been writing and thinking about his ideas for a long time.  The redundant themes about the beast's goal ""Control of the state and power as an end unto itself."" and ""The beast had always hated the same things: religion, a free press, intellectual inquiry and artistic expression. Anything that elevated or empowered the individual.""  These themes are terse, poignant and blatantly candid.  This is an ""in your face"" type of movie. Congratulations to this DVD's producers for a job well done.",1117152000,17,948,4.962025316455696
2230893,5,B0007Q3SII,"I feel it's a shame I had to buy a copy of this movie as opposed to seeing it in a theater. I don't believe there was even one theater in the area where I reside that showed ""In the Face of Evil"". This being in my opinion a rather tragic statement when a film like Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" played to overflow crowds and a brilliant documentary like ""In the Face Of Evil"" went virtually unnoticed. Ronald Reagan will go down in history as one of the truly great and most influential leaders of the twentieth century. This documentary very clearly points out the harsh realities of the Cold War and how Reagan more than virtually any other person so brilliantly helped bring an end to this sad chapter in world history. Where as Moore's ""F 9/11"" has been proven to be full of pathetic innuendo and miscarriages of truth to fit his own political agenda, ""In The Face Of Evil"" will someday receive the attention it so rightfully deserves as a well researched and valuable guide illustrating what a truly magnificent leader this nation had with Ronald Reagan as president. I strongly recommend this film to everyone regardless of their political point of view. I further believe this film makes for an excellent tool in helping teachers educate their students about the ""Cold War"".",1117152000,7,1285,4.6902654867256635
2230894,5,B0007Q3SII,"In less than two months it will be year since President Reagan left this world in order to touch the face of God and 'meet the Big Fella upstairs."" It is a pity that he had no chance to watch this movie. Yet it is a good reminder that his legacy is so well preserved and displayed in this movie.

The movie is somewhat divided in two parts - Words and Deeds. It is a wonderful combination, a genuine harmony that Gipper was always distinguished for. He made the Soviets to sit at the table of negotiations and with Gorbachov he managed to remove the Iron Curtain and then the Berlin Wall.

Which president could address the way he did? Which president could dare talk to Russians when they dropped the KAL AIRPLANE? And which president could force Russians to withdraw from Afghanistan and Nicaragua, not to mention his efforts to liberate the entire eastern European Block?

President Reagan will always remain in the history of mankind and if we spend evenings peacefully and go to bed without looking up in the sky with some fear, that is HIS merit! May His Soul Rest In Peace!

Special appreciation should go to the Leo McWatkins studio and the producer Mr. Tim Watkins who made this wonderful gift for all of us! The movie deserves galaxy of stars!",1113609600,25,1253,4.530973451327434
2230895,5,B0007Q3SII,"In the Face of Evil is a powerful epic documentary that chronicles the failure of appeasement, and the triumph of political and spiritual freedom.  Containment was not a realistic long term strategy for dealing with evil that desires to control the freedom of ideas and people.  Ronald Wilson Reagan's struggle and defeat of communism shows how he became a great liberator for those who were imprisoned by the forces of darkness.

The strategy and message is so simple, yet so brilliant.  Even now we have those false prophets who say they seek peace, but turn their backs on evil forces.  The film is so excellent because it displays the cycle of appeasement.  In The Face of Evil successfully shows how Reagan elevated the spiritual and defensive debate against the evil systems.  He was portrayed as a ""war-monger,"" and ""cowboy"" but he wielded the sword of peace.  Jesus reminds us to beware of those who are wolves dressed in sheep's clothing, and that we can judge the peacemaker by his fruit.  Nobody left a greater legacy of peace than the 40th President.

The film captures the strength and firmness of Reagan.  It also captures the strength and moral clarity of his ideas.  Perhaps most importantly the film captures the weakness and danger of those who wished to chart a different course.",1109289600,12,1298,4.85
2230896,5,B0007Q3SII,"This stellar documentary is more than a hat-tip to the late great President Reagan.  It is a reminder to the world that the various brands of modern-day evil (Nazism, Communism, and Islamofacism) all share the same core principles:  hatred of freedom, suppression of the individual, and a desire to dominate the world through violence.  The point of the movie is this:  Negotiating, bargaining, and pleading with evil forces (today that would be Islamofacism) only results in disaster.  The only way to co-exist with someone who wakes up in the morning plotting your destruction because it despises your free way of life is to defeat it outright.

The history in this film is eye-opening.  To see how one administration after another (Republican and Democrat alike) pandered to the Commies throughout the 20th Century as they grew stronger and we grew weaker made me realize that Republicans have historically been just as weak-kneed as modern-day Democrats; which is why Ronald Reagan, who stood up in the face of a great evil (despite constant criticism from European and U.S. media elites) was the best President since Abraham Lincoln.

Do you sleep well at night knowing that your children won't be forced to grow up in a totalitarian state?  Actually, that probably doesn't even cross your mind these days.  Thank God for that.  And don't forget to thank him for Ronald Reagan.",1107993600,16,1382,5.017543859649122
2230897,5,B0007Q3SII,"One of the best films I've ever watched. It tells the truth about the nature of socialism always bending towards totalitarianism and rejecting individual's rights to life, liberty and property.

Among which is the fact that the Republican establishment opposed him.  So did the democrats, of course.  This country needs more people in office not beholden to the established power brokers of the two major parties because those parties have been taking the American public for granted for too long.  And the American public has given them every reason to feel justified in exploiting their positions of power.  The two party systems has become a manner of ""Yankees vs Red Sox"" entertainment to keep the masses from seeing the real ball game: those that play all sides and never lose. Those in the 0.01 percent and those working for them to further their power.

First it provides a sweeping overview of how and why various types of totalitarianism developed in the twentieth century and the millions of dead which resulted.  Then it focuses specifically on how Reagan confronted one form of totalitarianism in particular, communism, over a forty year period.  From his days as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) all of the way to his time as President of the United States, Reagan always understood the evil which inevitably results from any system which places the interests of the state above the value of the individual.",1393459200,,637,4.990566037735849

Supposedly, ""Everyone Knew"" that the collapse of the U.S.S.R. was inevitable because their economy was in shambles.  I countered, ""Who do you think put their economy in shambles, while simultaneously building up the U.S.A.'s military and economy to be the most powerful in the world?

This is a wonderful documentary that matches the life work of ROnald Reagan with the formation and eventual take-down of the USSR. This is without a doubt one of the best written, directed, & produced films I have ever seen. This film reminds us that freedom is so fragile and that we must never take it for granted. It is also a time capsule of legends as the films has commentary by members of Reagan's cabinet that have now passed (weinberger, Kirkpatrick, etc). Some may say it is heavy on Conservative propaganda but the fact is that it is a documatary about RONALD REAGAN & the Sovet Take-down! Naturally it is going to be heavy with a conservative theme.

It allows those who were not there to experience the turmoil, the dangers, the trials and the triumphs of both our president and our nation.  Detractors may opine that too few 'political' warts are included in the documentary. However, those who experienced the era will recall the end of the Iranian hostage crisis and the demolition of the Berlin Wall. In this film, the viewer will witness the re-awakening of traditional American values of political 'conservatism' and a resurgence of the free-market economy. Those who revered President Reagan will experience a nostalgic return of the 'Founding Fathers' dream for America. They will see a return to an iconic principle of loyalty, and a tenacious spirit, that reinvigorated optimism in a nation that had grown dispirited under crushing inflation, and out of control government spending.  Viewers of this film will relive an amazing time in history, knowing that even in today's government- created economic disaster we can believe in something -  the American spirit.  Reagan set the standard by which today's political 'conservatives' are often measured.

Reagan was a rare beam of sunlight who stood up to totalitarian thinking and defeated it, not by appeasement, which never works, but is the usual choice of our leaders, but by boldness and strength.

2230915,4,B0007Q3SII,"This is a terrific documentary showcasing Reagan's forty year crusade to end communism.  The first ten minutes of the film are fantastic, quickly and concisely summarizing the beginning of communism and its rise to prominence in Russia. The documentary includes rarely seen footage from Reagan's early days as an actor and, later, as a spokesman for GE, when he traveled the country and began preaching against communism.

The majority of the film is devoted to Reagan's presidency and is spent reviewing Reagan's comprehensive plan to confront and defeat communism on all fronts: militarily, culturally, politically and economically.

The film is based on Peter Schweizer's book, Reagan's War. It includes interviews with former KGB operatives, Russian military defectors, former cabinet members and numerous historians.

One of the most interesting aspects of the movie was the footage of Reagan and his Democratic detractors and political opponents giving speeches and debating one another.  It's true that history repeats itself. The same things we see President Obama do today with Chavez in Venezuela and Ahmadinejad in Iran are what Reagan's critics suggested he do with Russia. Instead, Reagan stood firm, communism was defeated and democracy triumphed.",1240876800,,1261,5.546875

It's full of good and revealing interviews with those involved and tells a great story of a very ordinary man who hated the Commies and did his best to bring their evil empire down.

2230919,2,B0007Q3SII,"I am a Reagan fan who is always on the lookout for good DVDs and books about his influence. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by ""In the Face of Evil."" First, it tries to cover way too much, rushing through a summary of the entire 20th century. For a two-hour documentary, it would have been wiser to start in the 1970s or 80s rather than try to cover everyone from Lenin to Hitler to Osama bin Laden. Second, it divides the story into parts introduced by big black screens with ""WORD"" or ""DEED"" in huge letters. I wasn't sure what the purpose of this was. They were trying to make some kind of meaningful distinction between Reagan's words and his deeds, but I never understood why this was so important. It just seemed as though the story was interrupted by these puzzling announcements. Third, the tone of the documentary was a little self-righteous. Yes, I believe that there is good and evil, but I don't need to be beaten over the head with it. The material at the end about Osama bin Laden seemed especially gratuitous. For a much better treatment of similar material, see the three-part video series ""Commanding Heights,"" especially part two, which tells the story of the downfall of communism.",1208131200,5,1202,4.6745283018867925

The most insidious propaganda is when someone makes such a film and believes that they are unbiased when in reality their work is slanted in a subtle manner.

I grew up with the thought that all US Presidents were as great as this man only to be let down by each one following him.  I never realized what a great accomplishment this 'fool, and war monger' had achieved.

This is a great depiction without political bias of how the world we knew and loved has changed so drastically.  It does a superb job of showing by example how ""the beast has not passed"" by our door and we Americans and all peace loving nations have a duty to call out evil where we see it.  Never forget we are yet to become the shining city on a hill, America's greatest days are yet to come and with Reagan's charm, charisma, and humility we must carry the fire he lit inside us all, passing it on to the generations to come.",1183593600,2,902,4.215116279069767
2230926,2,B0007Q3SII,"[...]Even if you agreed 100% with everything the film had to say it is still so horribly produced and put together that it makes it incomprehensible. One minute Reagan is running for president, then the next he's two months in, getting shot, with no mention about the winning of the election. One minute Reagan is walking with Gorbechev, and we are told he seems lost and confused, so much so that Gorbechev had to graciously escort him away from the press, the next minute we see some dramatic footage of the wall being torn down, with no mention of the leadup, or why it finally was destroyed. The gaps are just gaping. No context, no thread of continuity except, ""The Beast""! Ohhhhhh, SCARY!!!!!!

Reagan may not have been the worst president we've ever had, but he certainly wasn't as great as this docuganda film makes him out to be. As if he single-handedly brought down the Soviet Union and ended Communism. As if no other world events led to the dissolution of the Soviet Empire, like it's collapsing under it's own weight, or the fact that many of the so-called Soviet puppet states were only loyal to Moscow so long as the guns and money were flowing in.

The distillation of 100 years of complex world history into some vague battle of the U.S. versus ""The Beast"" is so ridiculous. According to this film, the Beast is Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mussolini, Bin Laden, etc etc. Never mind the fact that Russia fought against the Nazis with the U.S., and Bin Laden fought the Soviet Union with our very generous aid (which the film very skillfully fails to mention in it's final sappy ""the beast still lives"" segment). So apparently the Beast is both our greatest single enemy, and our enemies' enemy and thus our friend. Kinda weird how that works huh? Seems kinda like a load of crap don't it. That's because it is.

In summation, if you think the world is at war in some kind of ultra-binary struggle between good and evil, with everyone on Earth either firmly in one camp or the other, and that one day your magical friend Jesus will come down from Heaven to rain lollipops and gumdrops on the faithful, and fireants and dog doo on the wicked, and that Ronald Reagan is the single greatest man that ever lived with the exception of Jesus or Adam, of garden of Eden fame, then this film is right up your alley. If you are a rational human being who doesn't fall for garbage in the guise of patriotism and the American Way, then avoid at all costs. Do something better with your 2 hours of time than watch a blathering, incoherent documentary about a mediocre actor who became a mediocre president.",1180137600,2,2605,4.573875802997859
2230927,5,B0007Q3SII,"Phenomenal production!

It not only portrays Reagan's admirable values and character, which most of today's politicians need to emulate, but it clearly establishes our how we must behave in order to conquer our current Beast, the Islamic fascists.

This should be a required viewing for all Americans, especially those who are too young to remember that period and are those vacillating as what we should do about the current Beast.",1179792000,,432,5.1571428571428575

But I was very disappointed with the movie. It felt a little more like a propaganda movie then a documentary. Its not as bad as lets say a Michael Moore movie but I felt that it was pushing its message too hard. Still I don't regret buying this movie only for its topnotch bonus material.",1179705600,6,466,4.188888888888889

2230930,5,B0007Q3SII,"There are few films that really make you think about our place in history and the importance of being involved with the events of today more than this movie.  This movie keeps you riveted waiting for what is next as all great movies do.  But it also provides so much never before understood and seen historical information and context to bring a whole new understanding of the cold war and by extension today's war on terror.

It is not a pandering look at Reagan at all.  It shows his strengths and his flaws.  But more importantly it shows the ebb and flow of public opinion about something as sinister as the evil of communism over the course of 50 years through the eyes of one unflinching anti-communist.

It leaves us wondering how much ebb and flow we will see as world events unfold in the war on terror.  Will we waiver in our ability to view terrorists as evil and let millions suffer as a result while we wait for a leader who is unwaivering enough and clear enough in purpose to assure it's defeat?  How many millions will suffer while we wait and while America develops sufficient resolve to see that victory is the only answer?

This movie was great art and a great history lesson that is so relevant today.  No matter your political views of Reagan, this is movie is an essetnial history lesson for everyone who enjoys freedom.  Buy, rent, see this movie!!!",1174089600,3,1372,4.51417004048583
2230931,4,B0007Q3SII,"For someone who was born in the 1970s and did not understand what was happening with regards to the cold war, this was a lesson on history. I learnt a great deal about courage in times of conflict. I like the spiritual tone of the narrator.  Thanks for the etras - the speeches made by Mr. Reagan. This product is worth it's price.

However I would not recommend this product for classroom instruction on history as it could be understood as being biased since it carries a proamerican / prodemocracy tone. This is a product for personal viewing based on individual choice and perspective.",1174003200,,589,4.653846153846154
2230932,4,B0007Q3SII,"The movie, In the Face of Evil, is a very well made look at Ronald Reagan's fight against Soviet communism from his early days as an actor to his time as President of the United States.  It puts certain actions and policies of the Soviet Union in a league with the actions of such regimes as the Nazis.  At the same time, it compares the early responses by governments to Hitler against the responses by governments to the Soviets.  It shows how similar these responses were, and how the policies of detante and containment that were in place before Reagan took office just didn't work.

It also shows just how brutal and horrible Josef Stalin was.  He literally had millions upon millions of Soviet citizens exterminated.

The movie is certainly beautiful looking, and extrememly stirring if you are a supporter in any way of the former President.  Admittedly, it does gloss over some things.  However, it is only a single movie and it does succeed in doing what it sets out to do.  It's focus is on Reagan vs. Communism, which, I believe, will be Reagan's legacy.  If you're looking for a more general look at Reagan himself, or an in depth look at the Reagan Presidency specifically, this is not the movie.  But, if you want a moving look at Reagan's role in the downfall of the Soviets, this is the film.

There are some books on the subject of Reagan's war against Soviet Communism, and they are eye opening.  The books tell you such thins as: for some time the Reagan administration leaked false technology information to the Soviet's through a spy whom the Soviets hadn't realized had been compromised.  This forced the Soviets to spend money developing technogy the U.S. knew wouldn't work.  Some of this technology went into a soviet oil pipeline, which later had a major mishap.  There was also a government dept. set up that had every export to the Soviet Union bypassed through it.  The idea was to ensure that nothing we exported to them could, in any way, be used militarily.  I could go on and on, listing some of the covert ways the administration went after the Soviets.

What the books and this movie make clear is that the fall of the Soviet Union wasn't simply due to Reagan calling them ""evil"".  There was an entire coordinated and covert economic attack on them, while, at the same time, Reagan was refusing to talk arms control until we were on a level equal or greater to that of the Soviets.  The arms control agreements of the '70s were neve taken seriously by the Soviets.  Following Reagan's buildup and his economic attack, the Soviets absolutely needed arms reductions to save their economy, but they were too late.

It becomes clear that the Reagan administration was a major reason why someone like Gorbacev was brought to power in the Soviet Union.

The best part of the movie is the subtext.  The containment, detente and peace agreements that were made with Hitler didn't work.  The containment, detente and peace agreements with the Soviets didn't work.  For such policies to work, the U.S. or allies must be coming from a position of strength.  The movie shows how so many really good intentioned people hope that evil (be it Hitler, Stalinist Communism or terrorism) can simply be wished away if they make nice and talk and use diplomacy.  The movie also shows how, unforutnately, this is usually not the case.  In that way, it provides a roadmap for the future.

""Evil is powerless if the good are unafraid,"" is a quote of Reagan's that is highlighted in the movie.  I think that quote is very true, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.",1169769600,3,3582,4.654458598726115
2230933,5,B0007Q3SII,"I was amazed at this documentary. So was my husband. We thought hands down it is one of the finest documentaries ever made - and not because of the subject matter, I'll get to that in a minute - but because of its ability to step off of the timeline, outside of our culture and world events and look upon the larger picture of events that have transpired and are transpiring now.

The subject matter is Ronald Reagan and all his flaws and human limitations are there for the reviewing. He is laid bare as on an operating table, but there is something else too. He is presented also as a human conduit (almost a ""tool"") for something way bigger and more important.

For those who don't think evil exists at all, I say, don't rent or buy this DVD. It is not an apologetic for evil existing. It rightly assumes it. For those who think there is no evil in the world except the ideology of Reagan and his ilk, don't delay in seeing this. All your criticisms of Reagan will be named and explained against the backdrop of a bigger picture, the one you need to see.

No one learns from history, not in all of history has a lesson been learned, but rather, Evil continues it's foray, persistent, relentless, always shrouded in the appearance of ""light,"" ""peace"" and ""goodness."" It has duped the world many times over. This documentary strips it bare, exposes the fraud and leaves an undeniable responsiblity with the viewer.",1148428800,12,1415,4.51953125
2230934,5,B0007Q3SII,"This is a truly excellent documentary that focuses on the historical context equally with the contribution that Ronald Reagan made to freedom.  This is not your average documentary either - it has production values worthy of the subject and the title.  Historical footage from the 20th century, combined with interviews of many of the people who were there, and a tightly edited narrative, make every second attention grabbing.  The narrator's tone invites a second look - and you'll see things the second time you missed the first.  For those who remember Victory at Sea and Why We Fight, this will not disappoint - even though it lacks Richard Rodger's score and the urgency of the latter's ""we're at war"" tone.  And you'll want to watch it again.  Though I thought I knew a fair amount about Ronald Reagan, the old films revealed his early days in hollywood - in the 40's - in a way that put his ""evil empire"" speech in context.  This is an important documentary of the 20th century.  For those who do not know much about Reagan prior to his presidency, it fills in the gaps of knowledge and helps you understand him - and the history he made.  And oh yes, the ""surprise"" ending puts the 21st century into context of the 20th.  Highly recommended.  This one's a ""keeper for the gipper""",1142553600,14,1288,4.629955947136564
2230935,5,B0007Q3SII,"First off, it was a great film.  I know there was only so much that can be touched on, in 2 hours.  I wish there were more on the end of the Cold War, but this did a nice job of condensing it all.  Read Peter Schweizer's book, Reagan's War, and it expounds on this more.  The chronology of Reagan's life, World War II, Communism, and his interaction with world events, even before becoming Governor and President is uncanny.  Reagan was a product of Hollywood, but unlike current Hollywood, was not afraid to name names and call out the disloyal.  The music in the film is unforgettable classics- Rachmaninoff, Wagner, Tchiachovsky and others.  The footage, some of it very disturbing, is indellible.  This film also expands on Reagan's very private, yet very assertive Christian background, which no doubt was pivotal in his policy decisions.  RIP, Mr. President. Good tribute, can't wait for a sequel or film on just one of the areas of this documentary.",1140652800,12,956,4.745454545454545

It is also a substantive account of 20th century foreign policies and history.  Reagan supporters will enjoy this movie and others will find it worthwhile.  It is appropriate for mature academic settings as well, including courses on comparative political systems, foreign policy, economic history, leadership, etc.  This film has the potential to help solidify President Reagan's place in history as one of America's greatest presidents.",1138233600,24,548,5.646341463414634
2230937,4,B0007Q3SII,"This film really demonstrates how great leaders are those that have strong priciples and don't back down from them despite strong pressure to do so.  Reagen is often portrayed as an unintelligent president who bumbled his way through 2 terms.  This movie makes a great case that Reagen was a visoinary whose ideas and actions (we are only now seeing) had a tremendous impact on world history.  His name will not be forgotten 1,000 years from now, in the same way that Charles Martel is still remembered.",1136419200,22,503,4.758620689655173
2230938,5,B0007Q3SII,"An accurate, dispassionate take on perhaps the most important topic of the 20th and 21st centuries - the battle between liberty and totalitarianism, and specifically Ronald Reagan's personal war against Soviet communism.

This work documents President Reagan's efforts, covert and overt, to destabilize the Soviet Union and free the billions in slavery to this evil empire.  It begins by detailing the rise of 'the beast' and continues with the ineffective efforts of previous administrations to respond.  Notes that this is handled is a completely honest and no-partisan way; President Nixon's secretive, suspicious nature and President Ford's ineptitude and self-denial are both presented honestly, as are the failings of Democrat administrations.

History is only now beginning to appreciate President Reagan's accomplishments but for those of us who actually remember the pessimistic depths to which America had fallen by the late '70s, it's almost inconceivable that anyone was able to not only revitalize American economic prosperity, military might and most importantly, pride and spirit, but at the same time land fatal blow after fatal blow to the Soviet Union.  President Reagan freed billions of slaves, at a time virtually no one else believed it possible.

I hope this is but one of the first accurate portrayals of President Reagan's accomplishments.

Highly recommended!",1133740800,8,1385,5.566666666666666
2230939,5,B0007Q3SII,"Ronald Reagan surprised his enemies when he actually did what he said he was going to do, a hard-to-find feature on a politician.

This movie masterfully chronicles the great accomplishments of a great president.  I would've liked to see it on the big screen.  This is a treasure in my DVD library.

The DVD features full-length uncut speech from the 60's where Reagan explained back then what he actually accomplished 20 years later.  A man of principle, with a backbone of steel.  An example for generations to come.  As a side note, take a look at what Reagan had to say on that speech about social security... very interesting.",1133308800,7,631,4.73394495412844

2230941,5,B0007Q3SII,"Last year, my Russian friend Nikita had tears in his eyes when he begged me and others to watch this video. I was so startled by his reaction that I did so. As I watched it, I remembered an incident of nearly 25 years ago. The night Reagan was first elected President. I had been swimming in my health club pool when I heard the news and was so horrified that I momentarily thought to drown myself. Instead, I prayed desperately that God would rid my country of this 'fool'. 25 years later, I am so glad God didn't listen. Because of Reagan, I got to see Hungarians and Poles dancing in their liberated countries, I saw ecstatic Germans smashing the Berlin Wall as it fell. And I saw a spectacle I never thought I would see in my lifetime (or any one else's), the hammer and sickle flag of Communism being lowered for the last time in Red Square. All because of a 'fool' I prayed God would get rid of.

""In the Face of Evil"" tells how this all happened. Without hystrionics, without brutal political bias, it relates how Reagan saw what the rest of us didn't - that the 'emperor' of Russia had no clothes of real power. And how Reagan had the courage to act on that vision. I had always thought he was the Great Communicator - now I understand why he is justly labeled the 'Great Liberator'. And why my friend Nikita wept when he watched the tale of how this single man set so many millions free. Please watch it.",1127347200,42,1413,4.292134831460674
2230942,4,B0007Q3SII,"I recently bought a couple of books on Reagan. The man is truly fascinating. The life of this man is definitly worth a Big read. When I saw this DVD recently I just could not resist...

The main feature is allright. You learn enough about the man to get the big picture. If you want to know the complete story however, then more viewing (and reading)is necessary! Reagan had a pretty interesting actors career and his 8 years as Governor of California is definitly worth a closer look. But, all in all, the focus in this story is mostly on his presidency, which does a good enough job.

The bonus is surely the speeches! This was ofcourse the real power and attraction of the man. When you are confronted for the first time with his apocalyptic speech from 1964 called ""A time for choosing"" you are almost blown away. Most of it still rings true today...

Obviously this is not a Hollywood production, and the maker's of this film had to work with a much smaller budget than a Michael Moore.  The reason for only a 4 stars is that some of the archival footage wasn't cleaned up. Maybe they didn't have the funds for this.  The Reagan speeches included are a plus.  Would have like his 1st inauguration speech included.  Would like to see more films/documentaries like this that are from a different viewpoint.",1122768000,10,502,4.724137931034483
2230944,1,B0007Q3SII,Reagan' presidency was a sham. The press is so afraid of Reagans popularity they are still afaid to tell the truth about him. The Russian PEOPLE ( from the top to the bottom) ended the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a disaster and the Russian people walked away from it. Raganomics: cut taxes by 25% but did not cut middle-class programs to make up the difference. He went on the biggest borrowing binge in  history. Congress autherized LESS money than Reagan asked for or his borrowing would have been even greater. Iran-Contra: he created his own secret government. Powers not given to him by our Constitution. He should have gone to prison. WHEN IS SOMBODY GOING TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT  THE REAL REAGAN?,1121990400,12,709,4.664
2230945,5,B0007Q3SII,"Ronald Reagan defended freedom for forty years as this documentary shows. He was not the lucky opportunist who just happened to become president when the Soviet Union was about to fail as so many liberals and most of the media would have us believe. (In any case isn't the media just a subset of the liberals?) Ronald Reagan began his crusade against evil and communism (its worst and most visible manifestation in the second half of the 20th century) when he was president of the Actors Guild in the 1940's. Soon after that his career as an actor failed. One wonders what might have happened if he became the leading man he wanted to be; would the world look as it does today with no monolithic enemy of the world remaining? Communism was for the most part soundly defeated and ""thrown on the ash heap of history"" as Reagan planned. Most interesting is the cohesive plan the Reagan administration hatched to attack the Soviets on every front and push them over the edge into decline. Secret orders signed, secret agreements made with such foreign leaders as Prince Saad of Saudia Arabia, a massive defense build up planned and implemented. Interviews with some former memebers of the KGB are important in demonstrating that such ideas as the Strategic Defense Initiative soundly ridiculed by most of the Western media were of great concern to the Soviets. In fact Gorbachev went to Rejhavic in 1986 with one main purpose; have Reagan give up on SDI. Reagan ever a man who stubbornly held to his views refused to give in. He closed his briefing book and went home. That one action may have completely sown the fate of the USSR. Frankly this DVD will bring tears to your eyes if you believe in great leaders and their affect on history. Great leaders can represent a branch in the river of time. Without them appearing or somehow springing up out of nowhere as Reagan, Churchill and others have, we would have gone down a different timeline with a world completely different, one much worse for freedom and the average person.

This documentary is particularly moving with a score and narration that perfectly matches the presentation.

I highly recommend this. I also highly recommend watching it with any liberal you know or are friends with.",1121472000,6,2243,4.763496143958869
