8502794,5,B0014FAISE,This is a must see for every fan of great b-film noir and crime movies! Basic story of ex criminal returning to town to find out who killed his kid brother-but done quite different and slick! Acting was quite good for basically unknown cast. Good filming and solid very good music score make this a great lost film gem that should be re-discovered! The print is a solid 10-perfect and sound very crisp-highly recomended! I applaud televista for finding and releasing great print of this winner!,1210982400,,494,4.755813953488372
