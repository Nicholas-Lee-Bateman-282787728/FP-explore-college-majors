4331447,4,B004D4Q1K2,"After the X-Files aired in the early '90s (filmed in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia), the Canadians decided to make their own version.

The Office of Scientific Investigation and Research (OSIR), a fictitious Canadian government agency, investigates reports of the supernatural and the unknown.  Hosted by Dan Aykroyd, each episode has two separate, unrelated cases.  Sometimes the unknown turns out to be something mundane but unexpected, while most of the time a more complex scientific or an otherworldly explanation is discovered.  In many cases, there is no definitive answer.

This series must be taken for what it is -- a simplified knock-off of the X-Files.  It is not as complex as the X-Files, and in the beginning there is no long-term plot line.  When an overall storyline begins to be woven into the stand-alone episodes, it seems a bit forced.  The head of the agency is played off as an unyielding jerk that has no tolerance for the incredible findings of his underlings.  The story starts with a little camp (but not so much as to miss out on your suspension of disbelief), and the announcement in season 4 that one of the major characters is a practicing Wiccan adds to the camp.

There apparently was little attempt to clean up the picture for this DVD.  Originally broadcast in 1996 (before HD), this recording appears as though it is still being viewed in the '90s.  Don't expect a crisp, clear picture.  There is also a problem with the way the DVD case is manufactured that results in easy breakage of the center hub and the spine.

Even though the acting and writing weren't quite on par with The X-Files, the show was still very enjoyable.  The stand-alone episodes are still very original, sort of a hybrid of The X-Files and Project: Blue Book.",1390348800,,1782,4.815789473684211
4331448,4,B004D4Q1K2,"I have one disk that had some problems, but this show's DVDs aren't easy to find or replace. I haven't seen all of the episodes, obviously, with four seasons and 6 disks in each season, but I'm mostly happy with them so far. I'm not happy with the packaging for holding the DVDs, but there isn't a choice. There'd be a 5-star rating if there weren't issues with the one disk and the packaging. The seller is great and I received the DVDs quickly.",1366329600,2,446,4.321428571428571
4331449,5,B004D4Q1K2,"This series is so little known but I watched it when it aired originally and have pined for it till it's recent release to DVD.  The first season is a shining gem going at story telling in a way not unlike the original Twilight Zone.  Having fallen out of favor with the gods of Television this work vanished from sight with virtually no reruns anywhere I could find.  It deserves a serious watch to the avid SF fan and even those people who have an interest in paranormal activity might give this a go.  It's certainly better than all the reality show paranormal garbage inundating television these days.

An important point to consider is that ""Psi Factor,"" changed formats from ""season one"" to ""season two""  Season one is two half hour segments that get in quick focus on the issues and attempt, though not always successfully, a solution.  It is quick scientific and straight forward.  Season two entered into the conventional concept of an hour long narrative and began to resemble ""X-Files,"" with a larger cast.  The case leader played by Matt Frewer played the hard to convince skeptic while his team tried to use their previously acceptable techniques.  It made for a less congenial and more drama filled story line.  However there are still some solid stories in seasons two and three.  Season four went off on a tangent and was ultimately resulted in the shows loss of fan following.  That and the crew was stripped down to virtually nothing so it became about a pseudo ""Mulder and Scully"" type team.",1363392000,5,1510,4.717557251908397
4331450,5,B004D4Q1K2,I watched this show when it was on in syndication back in the 90s and loved it. For the longest time only Season 3 was available and I wondered why the whole series wasn't. Problem solved. All four seasons are now available and I recommend this show to all Sci-Fi/Paranormal fans. The video quality and sound are both as good as when they were on TV.,1328572800,3,350,4.318181818181818

8424779,2,B004D4Q1K2,The show was fantastic but the DVDs not great two of them had missing sections or entire episodes.  I would have returned them but I watched them to see how the rest were and did not feel honest returning something I had watched,1524787200,,228,4.3023255813953485
8424780,4,B004D4Q1K2,"I have seen this entire series twice. Loved it. I just wish it hadn't ended so abruptly. I like Matt Frewer and all, but I don't think he was a good fit, but...... still loved the show.",1514505600,,185,4.027027027027027

8424784,4,B004D4Q1K2,The show is great.  The packaging is not.  There should have been a little more research and development put into the packaging.  Not using center spokes on the cd clasps may have saved space in the packaging but it also makes the discs less secure.  I am willing to deal with the subpar packaging because I love this show.,1501200000,2,323,4.423728813559322

8424786,5,B004D4Q1K2,I really enjoyed all the shows. My son didn't like it. Not enough action for him. I recommend this for older adults who are more into information versus excitement. Still not a bad for a older series.,1499385600,,200,4.4324324324324325
