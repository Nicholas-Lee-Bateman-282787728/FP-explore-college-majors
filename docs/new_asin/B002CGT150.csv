3906029,5,B002CGT150,"As another reviewer has already posted a brilliant analysis of this film, I'll keep mine to the perspective of a film and coffee consumer.

This little documentary style film balances humor, disappointment, resignation, and a persistent trek to discovery on the edge of specialty coffee's table. The narrative ranges from quirky-funny to pointed journalist. The interviews were superb and covered far more of the players of the specialty coffee industry than I would have imagined giving a great balance of views on American coffee culture and a bit of where the modern incarnation of it has come from. While this teeters on the edge of vilifying Starbucks, I feel the filmmaker recovers through narrative introspection about American corporate values and the legal framework relatively few people get to see. While Starbucks is in large part the push for Ferraris' disgust for America's version of the cappuccino and spokespeople vehemently against the corporate giant are given ample face time, she takes a good look into why they have been so successful and why they do some of the things that have led folks to believe they are evil squashers of small businesses.

This little film is a gem that belongs on the shelves of any coffee enthusiast. The side interviews are almost worth the price of the DVD as a whole.",1267660800,,1318,4.986363636363636
3906030,5,B002CGT150,"The Perfect Cappuccino - a film by Amy Ferraris - is a great investigation into the slipshod quality of coffee production in America and its implications for chronic imbibers. Cafe Rationale received a copy of the documentary today (I'm celebrating our first piece of official mail) and I'd like to share a few of my thoughts after the first watch.

About fifteen minutes into the film (this would be about the time I finished the stiff demitasse of Dominican coffee I'd pulled for myself on the stovetop) I realized something important: this is an intelligent piece of work. The front half of the research was funded by Ferraris' one-year grant from the Fulbright commission to study the history of Italian cafe culture. In the course of the film, she consults with professors of history and literature, representatives from Italy's oldest espresso roasters, former Starbuck's CEOs, and intellectual property rights lawyers. With an MFA from UCLA's film program and an obvious knack for assembling a coherent narrative, Ferraris brings a touch of academic heft to a subject matter that would appear hopelessly superficial in other hands.

Ferraris' penchant for broad contextualizing is manifest almost immediately: it is not long before we realize that the scope of her inquiry transcends the mug's rim, that her search for the perfect cappuccino is as much practical as it is metaphorical. And she doesn't pull many punches either.

In just a few steps, we see the damning juxtaposition between Italy's cafe culture and our own. We bounce back and forth between shots of thick, dense cappuccinos served in pristine white ceramics and soapy, spit bubble hogwash that's been dumped into recycled paper to-go cups. The cause of the deficiency? Americans' toleration of the corporate juggernaut, Starbucks. Her point is a subtle one. It's not so much that Starbucks is bad, predatory, and imperialistic; rather, the fact that any of us actually put up with this raises some serious questions. What does it say about us as consumers that we continue to vote with our money by spending it on subpar slop? What does it say about our palates? our aesthetic sensibilities? our commitment to go-it-alone Americanism?

The film succeeds in that, in a weird way, it gives Starbucks a fair hearing. Ferraris takes a few pot shots at the java giant, but not merely because it's an easy target: the point is that the American coffee retail industry and Starbucks are - very nearly - one in the same. This is cause for some concern and most of the film is spent in speculation about Starbucks' ability to successfully draw in so many people with a product of such poor quality and with the promise of such patently false mantras (individuality! sophistication! community! fraternite! universitas!) It is a call for responsible consumerism just as much as it is a cry for better coffee.

The Perfect Cappuccino also fairs quite well when stacked up against what had previously been the standard for coffee-based film, Black Gold. The latter film tackles the coffee industry from the supply side and, in this sense, Ferraris gives us a balanced counterweight: although she dabbles in economic talk from time to time, she's mostly concerned with what happens to the beans once they get to first-world consumers. This allows the film to be both more uplifting and more introspective. Whereas Black Gold ended so dismally and with so few answers put in place that I had to think twice about ever drinking coffee again, The Perfect Cappuccino ends on a high note with its coverage of the ""third wave"" of coffee retail pioneered by such industry innovators as Intelligentsia, Counter Culture, and Blue Bottle. The great thing about Ferraris' message is that it's personal and immediate: tomorrow morning I can go to Kaldi's Coffeehouse instead of Starbucks and begin to affect a change. And, if I'm lucky enough to have found a local roaster that sources its own beans, I might also be moving toward rectifying some of the problems presented in Black Gold.

If the film lags at all, it's when Ferraris' search for the perfect cappuccino becomes a small cafe owner's fight against a trademark infringement lawsuit instigated by a team of Starbucks lawyers. But even here, the message is handled well. Ferraris makes explicit for us a problematic juxtaposition. There is something uniquely American about the solo guy who can run his own coffeehouse from the ground up. On the other hand, the powerful American business venture is also ubiquitous in the narrative of the United States. While sitting around the cafe with its regular customers and dwelling on this comparison, the viewers slowly realize that the search for the perfect cappuccino is this place - the small, communal cafe with a passionate staff and an appreciative clientele. Having stumbled into java nirvana almost accidentally, a viewer of the film might sum up its moral in a word: authenticity. The perfect cappuccino is equal parts taste, feel, aura, sight, sound, perception, and intangibility. Sounds too hard to pin down? Believe me, you know it when you see it.",1247616000,4,5115,5.011764705882353
3906031,5,B002CGT150,"This is one of those rare and wonderful discoveries that is hard to imagine until you see it.  ""The Perfect Cappuccino"" is a fascinating documentary, intertwining everything from the conditions needed to make this transcendent treat, to fascism's rise and its impact on espresso machines, and what our coffee drinking habits say about American culture.  If you have any interest in the quality of food (in the vein of some of Michael Pollan's best musings), the role of capitalism in the quality of what we find in stores, or even just where to find the next best coffee outside of Sant Eustacchio, this film is for you!",1246579200,,620,4.785046728971962
8363954,4,B002CGT150,"This is what you are looking for, right here. This is a passionate look at cappuccino and mostly what is happening with cappuccino in America. The young lady who did most of the research loves cappuccino, and it shows in her analysis of the whole cappuccino culture.

I liked the background on Italy, and the baristas there. They are proud of their work. I liked the focus on DoubleShot Coffee Compay, and how he represented David vs Goliath. But I also like Starbucks, and I don't consider them evil. The documentary didn't present them as evil, but did show how they have corporatized coffee.

Overall, this is a passionate look at espresso and mostly cappuccino. I found the whole movie interesting.",1512345600,,702,4.793388429752066
8363955,5,B002CGT150,"I love all documentaries regarding coffee, The Perfect Cappuccino is especially entertaining",1473465600,,92,6.75
8363956,5,B002CGT150,Great insight into the world of coffee! The ones who are in search of the true cappucino or good quality coffee available in the US will appreciate this film.,1457568000,,158,4.482758620689655
8363957,4,B002CGT150,"Fun documentary that takes a look at the emerging third-wave coffee scene and contrasts it with the omni-present Starbucks coffee ethos. Personal experience lends the film a friendly aspect. It's wholly enjoyable, and, for the uninitiated it might serve to open their eyes to the world of specialty coffee, nudging them away from the ginger spice latte lines in favor of lines at cafes offering high-end micro-roaster's product lovingly brewed.",1420848000,,444,5.357142857142857
8363958,4,B002CGT150,"I learned a bit about cappuccino, but also learned a lot about the American coffee business.  I've probably mentioned the movie to 10-15 people over the last couple of weeks.",1416960000,,174,4.8
8363959,5,B002CGT150,"Very enlightening. . . worth the watching.  If only they could provide a cuppa, oh the pleasures!  We need more of these in Michigan!!",1366156800,,134,4.541666666666667
8363960,3,B002CGT150,This documentary starts off great then turns into a mind numbing useless complaint about Starbucks and issues related not really having ANYTHING to do with coffee or the work of what goes into making a cappuccino.,1356480000,,213,4.944444444444445
8363961,5,B002CGT150,I really enjoyed this film.  It just got better and better as I watched it.  I would recommend this to all baristas and coffees lovers.,1346889600,,135,4.36
8363962,5,B002CGT150,"When I started this documentary, I wasn't optimistic. I thought it would be like the ""potumentary"" genre, full of stock footage and uneducated conspiracy theories, along with the expected rants against Starbucks.

When Amy said she had a Fulbright scholarship to study the cappuccino, I knew things were looking up. It was a well-researched movie, following Italian and American coffeemakers and scholars, giving a strong historical basis on the drink, and managing to find interesting storylines.

The movie inspired me to seek out the best coffee in my city (Los Angeles) and I found a new, independent, award-winning microroaster who reminded me of Double Shot Coffee Company.",1340668800,2,679,5.336448598130841
8363963,3,B002CGT150,"The first 15 -20 minutes was really good. It looked at the espresso / cappuuccino culture and traditon in Italy.

The next 30 minutes or so went back to the United States and complained that Starbucks cappuccino was really bad. This was probably right. But, why was this so long in a movie that was searching for the perfect cappuccino. Boring and irrelevant.

Then there was some 15 minutes devoted to good cappuccino in the United States at a place called DoubleShot. But this morped into a drama about how this little shop in the middle of the United States was being sued by Starbucks because of their copyright on the name ""Starbucks cappuccino. A human interest story but boring again if you were looking to find out how to produce and find ""The Perfect Cappuccino"".

After a good start, there was very little time spent on the science and art of espresso / cappuccino.
The extras were interesting if you were interested in a description of the strategy needed to succeed at barista competitions. Again, we have to ask: ""where was the coffee?""

update:
I just took a better look at the ""extras"" on coffee roasting and brewing.
The ""extras"" are more interesting than the movie and are worth 4 or 5 stars.
Definitely watch the roasting one that contrasts the very traditional Italian roaster who works with a wood burning roaster and describes the cracking stages as the ""singing"" of the coffee with the American Doubleshot roaster in Tulsa who is a modern craftsman trying to get the best out of the beans.",1288742400,3,1511,4.690566037735849
