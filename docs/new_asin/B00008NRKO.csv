7985770,5,B00008NRKO,"I found this instructional DVD to be excellent. I tried the Internet You Tube instructional videos with mixed results. After trying this DVD the embouchure, positioning, breathing, just clicked.",1327017600,,194,5.724137931034483
7985771,2,B00008NRKO,"This DVD instruction video is only 38 minutes long. There is not a real lot that can be covered in this time. The instructor goes through care of the instrument and how to hold it quite well, but only 5 notes are taught (Bflat, C, D Eflat and F), and there are only two tunes learnt (Hot Cross Buns and Go Tell Aunt Rhody).

Also, the presenter seems slightly stiff, as though she is reading from cue cards for the length of the film, which I found quite distracting.",1168992000,21,467,4.247191011235955
