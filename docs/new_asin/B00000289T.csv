1177116,5,B00000289T,"When I posted my review I named Kevin Brown as one of the background singers.  That was incorrect.  His name is Kevin OWENS and he was originally the lead singer of the group Ray, Goodman & Brown.
Also, two other songs featured in this concert are ""Any Love"" and one of my personal favorites, ""For You to Love"", a song that has that one of the funkiest bass lines (check out the fingersnaps!) K.  Just wanted to add that.  Again. Get this tape! You won't be disappointed in this trip down memory lane.

1177132,4,B00000289T,"There is something they did on this DVD that I wish all concerts had, that is, close captioning. Now, you don't need it for the singing, it's just that when someone's on a mike, the volume is so much lower than the music, you can't always make out what they're saying. So that is a great feature. Of course Luther is great, that's a given. But I was kind of hoping for a greatest hits concert, this is not. When most of us buy a concert video, we kind of like to watch them perform their hits. I will treasure this one, but I'll have to add another one to round out the Luther experience. For those of you who want to see the song list, here it is: Never Too Much, Any Love, Love Won't Let Me Wait, Give Me The Reason, Singer's Intro Medley: I heard It Through The Grapevine, by Ava Cherry, Great! , too  bad it's a medley/ Young Americans/Love On A Two Way Street, Searching, For You To Love, Superstar, A House Is Not A Home, She Won't Talk To Me, Stop To Love.  Ok, some great hits, just not complete, you can never have enough, I'll just have to get another one.  Very good DVD overall, Great video, sound, and the close captioning really makes it stand out.",1463270400,3,1162,4.178571428571429

1177149,5,B00000289T,"Luther Vandross remains the diamond standard for male voices. His tone and articulation was so clear. The only thing that matched the power of his vocal ability was his ability to write lyrics and arrange songs. We truly lost an amazing man. This video is classic Luther Vandross at his best. It is full of theatrics and vocal substance.  He sings all of the classics... including ""A house is not a home.""  For those who were not alive or old enough to remember him, this video serves as a great lesson in Luther Vandross Musicology 101. Enjoy!",1434067200,3,544,4.597938144329897

1177166,4,B00000289T,"I find that this is a great live performance to see Luther Vandross sing and perform.

Luther Vandross is my all-time favorite singer, and this is a 1989 live performance with him singing live at Wembley that I have and would watch every now and then, but not often. I do like Luther's appearance and how well-dressed he was, wearing a black sparkling jacket and tuxedo on stage, singing live with his back up singers, and introducing the audience to his musical director and back up singers. This is the only live performance that I would watch with Luther singing, and a video tape with his music videos that's more of my favorite called ""The Best Of Luther Vandross."" And from that video tape with Luther's music videos, it shows a clip from this live performance with Luther singing ""Give Me The Reason,"" as one of the videos. I also find that Luther Vandross looked more distinguished in this live performance at Wembley than he did singing live at Royal Albert Hall, but it shows him looking big and heavy, and I like thin Luther. Still he does look good singing though, but I just wouldn't want to remember him as a big and heavy person, being that he's even missed. So this live performance is the one that I like better than the one with Luther singing live at Royal Albert Hall. It is also known that Luther Vandross passed away on July 1, 2005, but his memory lives on, and this live performance with him singing brings back memories of him.

The music videos from ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs) with Luther singing is what I really like more, but believe me I do like this concert performance with Luther singing. I just don't watch it as often. And I would sometimes watch it on the DVD where I have it converted on. I remember noticing a Power Of Love tour with Luther singing live in concert back in 1991, and I find that this video with him singing live at Wembley is just like it. So, I would pretend or make believe that this is a 1991 Power Of Love tour with Luther singing live in concert. And I would also want to remember Luther from this era of when he first came out as a great singer.

I have this ""Live at Wembley"" (1989 vhs) and ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs) converted on both DVD's with Luther performing, and the VHS tapes are kept as a duplicate.",1417996800,,2297,4.4

I purchased this DVD for my wife for our anniversary.  I took my wife to see Luther Vandross in concert.  He was performing in Irvine,CA and we had a blast!  It was her first time seeing Mr. Vandross in concert, and my third time.  We were so hurt by his death just a few years later.  We now have this live DVD of him to help keep him in our heart and mind.  Thank you for making it possible.  Our order came in a fast and prompt manner with no problems!  Thank you, once again,

I would often rent it from our local Blockbuster video until I decided to just purchase it. I just can't believe it's taken me 15 years to finally buy it.  I truly enjoy the music and I watch the DVD every chance that I can get.  I am very pleased with it and am glad to have to collection to my library.",1123459200,2,435,3.7888888888888888
1177238,5,B00000289T,"First of all God Bless Luther for his music,and writing so many heartfelt songs.  He was just getting started and having Clive Davis as his new boss J Records you know the best was yet to come.  For those of you who never experience Luther live in concert please buy this dvd and see for yourself the man and the music all come together.  Lisa Fischer, Ava Cherry and Kevin Owens are singing their tails off vocals are so tight.  This 1988-89 tour recorded in London is a keeper for any true Vandross fan.  One more to own is the forth coming his last DVD Concert at Radio City Music Hall 2003 Tour. Nat Adderely Jr. and Luther gave us so many soulful and beautiful songs to last the test of time.  Like Karen Carpenter, Luther with all the weight changes in his career the Voice never changed.  Look for a Roberta Flack in concert with a young Luther Vandross singing backup and checkout Aretha, Dionne, Patti cd's with Luther adding his touches to it.  The babyboomers have lost one of our major Male Singers of our time.  Luther was the Real Deal no studio work here the boy can sang, arrange, write, stage his own concerts too.  Clive please put out a special Greatest Hits CD with some special tracks with Aretha, Dionne, Patti, Chaka, Bette and Streisand, Lisa Fischer one for the Fans Mr. Davis! A long time fan of J/Arista Records too.",1123113600,4,1343,4.444897959183673
1177239,5,B00000289T,Luther gives an astonishing show.  Whenever you see Luther in person or through one of his live performances on DVD you can expect superbly the best.  Excellent performance at Wimberly.,1123027200,2,185,5.133333333333334
1177240,5,B00000289T,"What a wonderful singer we've just lost.  This video is priceless.  His renditions of A House is Not a Home and Superstar on this concert dvd can only be outdone by the man himself.  Not only is Luther's voice velvety smooth but I guarantee that no one can adlib a song like he does.  He could sing happy birthday and stretch it to last 30 minutes.  There are great singers who can sing what's written on the page but they can't give you anything more than that (i.e. Whitney Houston).  But it's all those little extras that Luther puts into a song that made it special.

Ladies and gents, I kid you not, when he sings Superstar it is truly mesmorizing.  You actually feel exhausted when he finishes the song because it's packed with so much emotion.  But while he sings it all you can do is sit there like you've been hypnotized, hanging on every note, and waiting for and wanting of it more even though you know he's done with it.

Luther has always prided himself on being a story teller.  There's no talent required to write lyrics that ask us to get undressed and jump in the sack with someone.  But a poet can find so many creative ways to express emotion and that's what holds your attention.  It's the story of love being told.  Not just songs about jumping on someone's bones.  That's what brings out the feeling of love we have for one another.  This is, today, a rare art.  Whatever shall we do without Luther?  There will never come another I'm afraid.

No one can compare to him and that's the heartbreaking thing of it all.  I hope he now sings in the midst of the angels.

...And now another has taken flight,
to leave this world of hateful plight.
And when I close my eyes to be kissed,
I'll think of your music and how you'll be missed...

Rest well!

There will never be another Luther.  You should treat yourself to this dvd before they become too hard to find.",1120608000,74,1880,4.351585014409222

Never forgetting his humble backup singer beginnings, Vandross allows his supporting players, among those the brilliant Lisa Fischer, to shine in many of the selections.
