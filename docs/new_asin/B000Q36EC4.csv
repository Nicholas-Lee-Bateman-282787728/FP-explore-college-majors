Warren's humor is quick, funny, and for most of us, unexpected.  His wit matches his wisdom about how to make money through well-chosen investments.  Charlie's wisdom centers on selecting the right questions that trigger penetrating responses.  Both men prefer being addressed by their first names - which teaches the rest of us a lesson about the absence of pretense.",1369526400,,513,5.468354430379747
8194070,4,B000Q36EC4,"The master- investor speaks about his strategy for acquiring businesses, and putting them in the hands of the people who know how to best run them. He tells about his charitable lunches in which people bid large sums to have the privilege of sitting with Buffett and partaking of his years of experience and wisdom in investing. He displays a humility in suggesting that those who work for him have abilities he does not have.
