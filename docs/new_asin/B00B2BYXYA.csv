8561345,5,B00B2BYXYA,"Kobayashi is a giant of film-making, NOT just Japanese films. His excellently scripted and acted films show a rare concern for the human condition which transcends time and place. Excellent films.",1454630400,3,196,5.354838709677419
8561346,4,B00B2BYXYA,Not knowing anything about Kobayashi before buying this collection I had no expectations but what I've seen so far (the first two films) has been excellent.  My interest is in post-war Japanese cinema and especially modern or urban stories so this set is perfect for me.,1435017600,3,270,4.869565217391305
8561347,5,B00B2BYXYA,"An excellent box from one of the best japanese directors. Highly recommended, a real gem for every collector interested in japanese film or any good movies.",1405641600,2,156,5.038461538461538
8561348,3,B00B2BYXYA,These movies are fine but not as good as a lot of contemporary films. I'd start with Kurosawa if your interested in 20th century Japanese storyies. I also liked Woman of the Dunes and Face of Another. Kobayashi's Harakiri is an excellent samurai movie.,1374278400,3,252,4.75
8561349,5,B00B2BYXYA,"Four gritty and brilliant films from one of Japan's least appreciated film directors. A great collection which includes ""I Will Buy You""...maybe the best film about baseball made in the 1950s. Where most US films about the sport at that time were glossy comedies or tear jerkers, this film explores the dark side of outside influences on the sport.",1372896000,14,348,4.915254237288136
8561350,5,B00B2BYXYA,"Chances are if you are viewing this, you probably know who Masaki Kobayashi is.  If not, then you should remedy that problem by watching one or several of his films.  He was a central figure in the movement of Japanese post war cinema from American censorship to independence.  His films have created controversy for years.  In fact, the first film of this collection, 'The Thick-Walled Room' was not allowed to be released until several years after filming due to US occupation censorship.  His films include the amazing (and 9 hour long) 'The Human Condition', starring Tatsuya Nakadai; Hara-Kiri (actually Seppuku); and Kwaidan, which was robbed for a foreign film Oscar.  His films center on very Socialist themes, existentialism, and human empowerment.  His films were often thought to be inflammatory and censors feared that the Japanese public would raise an outcry against the post WW2 occupation forces.  (It happened anyway.)

The first film is the one I consider the best.  'The Thick Walled Room' (1953 - released 1956) is about a group of WW2 soldiers imprisoned for war crimes.  The irony is that the more serious (Class A) war criminals were released already due to negotiation with the Japanese government, but the less serious war criminals were forgotten.  Kobayashi wanted the Japanese public to take notice of this oversight.  The film actually takes place partially through flashbacks of the events leading to the soldiers' incarceration.  We see that these soldiers were merely put into situations where there was little recourse but to follow orders and carry out inhumane actions.  In fact, in one instance, the commanding officer gives the order for one of his soldiers to kill a civilian he suspects is working for the enemy (this after the man gives them food and drink in his hut).  The soldier does not want to and even argues with his superior, but he carries out the task regardless.  In the trial, his superior turns the tables and tells the tribunal that he actually tried to talk his subordinate out of the task and hence the commanding officer is set free.

The second film, 'I Will Buy You' (1956) is like an older 'Moneyball'.  A Japanese college baseball star is preparing to enter the big leagues.  The film centers around the agents trying to entice the player into playing for their team (one agent in particular) and the player's personal 'coach' or 'leech' as the agents call him.  The film is an obvious outrage against the wanton spending of the baseball teams and the exorbitant salaries that these players were starting to command in Japan in the 1950s (and during the end of the post war recession in Japan).

'Black River' (1956) is less notable now, but in the year it was released caused a huge uproar.  The film is very important because it was Tatsuya Nakadai's first major role.  The film warns about the corruption on US bases in Japan during the occupation and the steady rise in crime as a result.  I felt the first half of the film was uneven, but that it built steadily, showcasing the plight of the working class.  The themes are very Socialistic.  The landlady and the real estate developer are portrayed as tyrants, but the remainder of the cast seems to be pretty self serving as well.  Even when asked to give blood to save a neighbor's life, the tenants all claim to be neither A nor O blood types.  The final few scenes, once we start Joe the Killers birthday party are the best.  The ending is a triumph and makes the previous hour well worth it.

'The Inheritance' (1962) is a film about a man's inheritance being split between his three illegitimate children.  The film is later than the previous, and was filmed and released after 'The Human Condition', but it still shows much of his earlier style.  Obviously another outrage against capitalist greed.

So there you have it.  Four films, not much in the way of special features, but that is what one expects with the Eclipse Series releases.  This is another amazing collection of Japanese post war cinema and deserves a spot in any film lover's library, especially fans of post war Japanese film and films with a very leftist view.",1371340800,36,4153,4.8
