I ordered this along with a dvd on learning bass scales but that dvd was on backorder and should arrive within a week. I've been able to grasp about 6 or 7 of the riffs so far and have had it for less than a week. He's a good teacher. Thanks Mr. Andrew!!",1500508800,,397,3.9135802469135803
8670640,4,B00M856D1U,This DVDs shows many riffs that are really important to know to play with other band members! I do feel however that the instruction could be explained better. Like telling the student what note each finger plays. It's difficult to see which of his fingers are hitting what strings and or notes!,1461196800,,295,4.6923076923076925
8670641,1,B00M856D1U,"First up, the content is great, though def for beginner-intermediate; this is in no way advanced, as some seem to claim. So here's why the 1 star. Try getting any of the supplemental materials thru' TrueFire (in this case, I went to grab the Tab download--ha! dream on, dreamer). Truly Hateful, Truly Awful, or, as President Rump would say: Truly, You're Fired! is what this gang ought to be called. I've bought several TrueFire DVDs and seem to never learn: the PINs don't work, customer service is non-existant, and you just aren;t going to get your hands on the supplemental materials without a huge run around, multiple emails, and lots of frustration. No extra charge for that crap, so if that's your thing, but away! Otherwise, look to another brand for your lesson materials.",1456617600,,782,4.843283582089552
8670642,5,B00M856D1U,"I really enjoy the Andrew Ford course selections in this series (he has a few).  This course is for early intermediate players and above who want to add to their vocabulary some interesting grooves.  There are 50 of them and I would say 35 are must learn and the other 15 could be useful in certain circumstances but maybe not all the time.  With the tab it is easy to learn but you don't need it since you can watch it on a split screen and just absorb while he is playing.

Each groove is broken down and he explains why it works and where it sits in the song musically.  Grooves based on tunes from Stevie Wonder, Jackson 5, Larry Graham, Kool and the Gang, Rick James, Meters, Chuck Rainey, James Jamerson, and a lot more.

There are a few grooves that are slap and pop based.  I don't play that so I had to skip those.  Your mileage may vary.  I did try to play them in my own fashion to get the rhythm practice.",1456099200,2,917,4.135593220338983

8670644,4,B00M856D1U,"If you are freshman to bass playing, this might be a little much to start with.  You do not need to know how to read music to learn from this DVD, however a good working knowledge of different scales is very helpful.  The very first groove has the terminology ""using the notes of the dorian mode over the Dm7 chord and the mixolydian mode over the G7 and of course some half and whole step chromatic intervals to connect the notes.""

However, Andrew Ford's ability to demonstrate these assorted grooves is great.  There is a set of learning tools that can be downloaded from guitarlab which is very helpful.  There is also a booklet that is downloadable of the entire set of ""grooves"", however, as it is sometimes difficult to see Ford's fingering at times, I think they should also include some downloadable tab charts.",1414108800,2,820,4.627586206896551
