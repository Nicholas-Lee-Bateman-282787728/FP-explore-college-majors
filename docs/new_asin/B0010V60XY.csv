3050841,5,B0010V60XY,I've been using this DVD for a week now & I love it! I've been working out to Leslie's videos for a number of years now and I love them! I've tried other exercise videos but ended up being frustrated when I couldn't follow the choreography. Not with Leslie's videos they are the BEST! This Walk Slim 4 mile is AWESOME! If you are a Leslie fan you will not be disappointed with this DVD - FANTASTIC WORKOUT!!!,1210809600,7,408,4.243589743589744
3050842,5,B0010V60XY,"This is my fourth exercise video by Leslie and it is by far the best ever!!  I love to workout with Leslie and her buddies. I have lost 32 pounds and I love most of the music. I have owned it for 6 days now and I started walking the total 4 miles after 2 days. I did not think the 3 mile walk (pink case) could be beat and I still love it, however this is my all time favorite! I am not really crazy about the music on one of the miles otherwise you go Leslie, and keep those exercise videos coming! You are my hero.",1210550400,5,516,3.7777777777777777
3050843,5,B0010V60XY,"I just received this workout a couple days ago and I've done it twice already!  It's a great workout and makes me sweat!  I started with Leslie back in July 2007 and could barely do the one mile easy walk.  Now I can do ANY of her workouts and I've lost 81 lbs and all I ever do for exercise is Leslie workouts.  This one is my new favorite!  Believe me, it will get you in shape and I NEVER exercised before Leslie.  It's the real deal!",1210377600,110,437,3.9655172413793105
3050844,5,B0010V60XY,"I have one other 4 mile walk (the old Weight Loss Walk--I recommend it if you can find it) and this is a nice addition.  It does contain ""boosted walking"" (light jogging) but I stick to power walking and still feel like I am getting a good workout.  Leslie is a little silly at times and she interrupts Mary Kay's part of the walk a bit too much for my taste but the strength of the workout overcomes the weaknesses.",1210377600,9,416,4.1875
3050845,5,B0010V60XY,"I only have a few of Leslie's workouts, but they are all good and fun and easy to do while burning off a lot of fat.  As each of these miles goes, they get faster and faster.  The first mile is easier and it builds in intensity till you're really getting your heart rate right up there.  At mile three, that's when you start to add some gentle jogging and then at mile four, you're using resistance bands (optional) to work your upper body and also maximise the fat burning and your heart rate.
Leslie is a terrific cuer and she is motivating and friendly.  She's always encouraging and that pushes you through when you think you really want to quit.  I find this workout easy yet calorie burning and I have no hesitation in recommending it to almost anyone who wants to lose weight and burn fat.  You'll have fun while doing it so you'll hardly know you're working out.  I love it.",1210291200,102,882,4.341463414634147
3050846,5,B0010V60XY,"I love this workout!
I love the fact that is chaptered.
I do mile 1, mile 2, mile 3, then I press the back button on my dvd to repeat mile 3 and then hit back twice and redo mile 1.
I tend to skip mile 4 because I enjoy being able to do a full sixty minutes of cardio without any boosters (the stretchie band).
Doing the sequence of mile 1, mile 2, mile 3, mile 3 and mile 1 gives me 62 minutes of solid cardio in my living room.
I love the fact that I can modify this workout to suit my needs.
I do not jog during the 3 ninety second jogging intervals, I just march in place. But the song used during the interval is fast paced so I do increase my marching pace for 90 seconds.
Also, some days, I repeat mile 1 four times for a good solid 4 mile walk.
Or, if I am strapped for time, I just do mile 1. It's a good solid mile with lots of arm movements.
This is my favorite Leslie Sansone workout of all time!",1210032000,48,908,3.7842105263157895
3050847,5,B0010V60XY,"I love Leslie Sansone!  Two thumbs up! I had NEVER exercised before I found Leslie!  I am so glad she is my personal trainer for pennies a day and I don't have to drive anywhere!  I look forward to her walks every day and I intend to do this kind of exercise the rest of my life!  It's a no brainer--put in the tape, rain or shine, day or night, hot or cold and WALK!  Start with a mile and work up as you become more fit and you will become more fit if you stick with it.  Consistency is the key.  Everyone has 15-30 mins. a day. Leslie promises: ""you can get fit in minutes a day and you will reach your goals if you don't quit!""  She delivers and I'm living proof!  I feel like I know Leslie, Joanne, Linda, Carol and my favorite speedwalker, Mary Kay (she's high energy!) My walking buddies!  I pop in the tape and report for my personal fitness class right in my bedroom! If it wasn't for Leslie, I would still be struggling with my weight, looking for the next diet, and trying to find attractive clothes that fit!  This is no longer a problem for me!  I own a stack of Leslies tapes and choose whatever I want on a particular day.

This entire ""Walk Fit"" series is excellent!  I couldn't wait for this one so I purchased it directly on Leslie's website.  This one is so much fun!  If you're a newbie to walking, you may want to do just 1 mile at first and build up. Boy, does the time fly!  When you finish, expect to be sweating!  You can feel the weight come off effortlessly without starving yourself too!",1208995200,38,1515,4.147766323024055
3050848,5,B0010V60XY,"This was a great walking DVD. I own quite a few of Leslie Sansone's walking workouts, and this one really gives you a good burn. Though it consists of the basic walk steps of her other videos, you get the Boost portion that ramps up the activity. The clip posted on this site is the wrong clip because this DVD features her regular walkers along with a few new faces. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes indoor walking for weight loss and fitness.",1204502400,50,465,4.4186046511627906
3050849,5,B0010V60XY,"I really like this DVD. You can pick 1,2,3,or 4 miles. She does the same basic moves as are in her other videos but you use the included band in the 4th mile. The 2nd mile is 10 mins. so you do Boosted Walking which is jogging in place. This is a good workout, 4 miles in about 54 mins. I'm not crazy about the music but it doesn't matter because I use picture in picture and watch a TV show instead. Overall a great way to burn some calories and not have to go out in the cold!",1203033600,65,478,3.8383838383838382

3050863,3,B0010V60XY,"Been doing Jessica Smith's walk DVD (which I love!) and wanted to try Leslie's DVD.  I like Jessica's because you can mix and choose the miles you want to do; not the case with Leslie's DVD.  Also, I do not feel I am getting enough cardio with Leslie's.  I do like the section with the band.  Unfortunately, this will not be one of my 'go to' DVDs.",1502064000,,348,4.149253731343284

3050871,4,B0010V60XY,"I'm giving this 4 stars but I would actually rate it 4-1/2.  I love Leslie Sansone's DVDs and own quite a few of them.  I like this one because it is broken up into segments and you can mix them up depending on your schedule or you energy level on any particular day.  I didn't give this 5 stars for a couple of reasons.  First off, some of the music is awful.  I don't know if it is my TV or what, but in the first mile the song after the warm up I am constantly stopping to try and find the beat because I just can't hear it.  And the song for the boosted walking?  Sounds like my old record player when I would change the speed to super fast in the middle of a song.  (I know, I know....some kid reading this just went, ""What?"")  Some of the cues are off with the steps, which I know happens, but this isn't her first DVD.  And the talking.....oh my.....I should be used to this by now, but wow.  Near the end, she says she's going to stop talking so we can hear the song playing.  Yeah, no.... there is no stopping of the talking.  I did like when Mary took over part of the instructing.  She did a great job!  Overall, another winner for Leslie fans.",1487289600,,1155,4.026431718061674

3050893,5,B0010V60XY,"Some people complain that there's a lot of bouncing or that it does nothing for them. Let me tell you. I have a back injury and I make sure I do solid movements so I'm not bouncing around. Even with my fragile back, I am able to get my heart rate up and get an awesome sweat. Similarly, my husband is in great shape with no ailments and he does this video with me with greater intensity and force and he LOVES the video. He started doing the video with me as encouragment, once I was out of my back brace and able to do workouts. He thought he would only do the video until I didn't need help, but now he does it with me regularly because he likes that he can make it tougher while I can make it as easy as I need for my back. Be sure to consult your doctor if you do have a fragile back. My doctor said it was ok :)",1465084800,,816,3.834319526627219

3050913,5,B0010V60XY,"Definitely Leslie's best walk. It moves fast so 4 miles seems to go by quickly. Plus she seems less annoying in this one than in her others (ie, she doesn't rant and rave about how much she loves sweat in this one ... that's really tiring). I like how her moves are simple in this one (no silly dance moves or difficult aerobics) yet it's incredibly effective. The downside is that I have owned 2 DVDs so far and they both skip and freeze in the 2nd mile. None of my other DVDs skip so I think it's due to poor quality.",1447459200,,519,4.098039215686274

3050915,4,B0010V60XY,"I'm an advanced walker and credit Leslie Sansone (and weight watchers) for helping me lose 85 lbs and get to my perfect weight and keep it off for five years.  I own about 20 DVD's by Leslie and do one a day.  This DVD makes a good Saturday workout when you have a little extra time, it's an hour long.  It's an enjoyable workout and goes by quickly.  The music is fun and is at a good volume and it really helps keep you motivated.  Leslie mainly uses the four standard walking steps - walking, side-steps, knee lifts, kicks, and ""kickbacks"" - in this workout.  In the fourth mile she does a decent workout for the upper body using the stretchy band.  The only negative I can think of is she does some standing bicep curls during this mile and doesn't quite give you enough time to set yourself up for them.  Also, I don't like when a walking workout breaks up the flow by incorporating any standing toning movies.  I prefer to save those for a short session after the walking workout or devote an hour a couple times during the week for a good weight lifting session.  If you've got a good sweat going and are in the flow of the workout, don't break it up by suddenly standing still and doing bicep curls.  That's just my opinion.  This break-up in the routine during this one short segment is the only reason I knocked this workout down from five stars to four.  Leslie mainly keeps this workout at low impact but, in the the third mile she does do intervals of high impact ""boosted walking"".  Of course, you can keep it low impact if you want.  It's only three cycles.  She does incorporate a couple easy Yoga moves during the stretching segment which is always nice.  As an advanced walker, this workout gets me in a decent sweat if I really work it hard but it doesn't get me out of breath or make me feel like I'm breaking a plateau.  I think it's an excellent and fun workout for those trying to loose weight or those, like me, just trying to stay in shape.  I recommed this one.",1441411200,10,1987,4.307277628032345
3050916,5,B0010V60XY,This is a real favorite walk exercise DVD.  If I have time I can do all 4 miles; if I'm short on time I can choose to only do 2 or 3 miles.  Love it!,1439251200,,149,3.2285714285714286

More moves thrown in (toe tapping and diagonal knee-lifts) -nothing that I couldn't fall into right away.

It's possible to just do one or two workouts, but there's no cool-down, so stopping at one mile will leave one fairly breathless for a couple of minutes.

It goes really, really fast. If you're out of shape or stiff, it will be a good idea to work up to multiple miles.

A note for those of you who might play the DVD on a computer, the file format is an MPEG2, which means if you have a newer Windows OS, like 7 or 8, you'll need to download a player in order to view the workouts.

She works out many different parts of your body, upper and mostly lower, you get a good diversified workout, on days that are too hot or rainy to workout outside. Alternate between this and other workouts, and you will be in shape. I would say this is a moderate work out, not too strenuous nor too easy. I bought it for a friend of mine who was looking for a good at-home workout, and she loved it! It beats driving to the gym, saves you time and $$$. Thank you!",1405296000,4,580,4.37962962962963

I used my heart rate monitor and after the 4 miles, I burned 501 calories! Everyone is different though, and you should use a heart rate monitor to get an accurate burn. If you do not weight very much you will have a lot less of a burn, but just as good cardio vascular workout. I got it in the mail quite fast as well!",1379030400,,448,3.827956989247312

3051014,4,B0010V60XY,"I just started a high-intensity workout program from Beachbody and was looking for an easy-going, but still challenging workout for down days since I'm trying to work out everyday. This really fits the bill. I used her simpler workouts in the past, but find them way too sedate now. The pace on this one is picked up and the moves are stronger, and you can push up your own intensity (sitting lower, lifting your legs higher, and adding a little power on some moves) to make this even more challenging if it gets easy. Or if you've hit it really hard the day before, and you just want a some movement to warm you up, burn some calories and then stretch, you can do that as well. On days when I do 30-40 minutes of a serious strength workout, I get four options for a single mile to do after for some cardio that doesn't kill me. Good DVD for your rotation regardless of your fitness level.",1376352000,,889,4.3293413173652695

I need low impact and though she does the ""boosted"" walking (gentle jog) in this dvd for 2 minute segments, the power walking alternative works really well for me.

I'm in my mid-fifities, and this is something that I can do just about anywhere, so I can take it with me on trips, etc.. When you buy it brand new in the stores, it came with a pc. of stretchy fabric to use in the last mile of the workout. Since this was a used copy, that was not included. It's ok, though, because I'd purchased some resistance bands already, so I use one of them. Really, really glad I bought this exercise video!",1371772800,,649,4.2

3051052,5,B0010V60XY,"I owned two Leslie dvds previous to buying this one and this one is by far my favorite!!

It is 4 miles, the first mile is a classic 15 minute mile, the second is a faster paced 12 minute mile, the third mile has a lot of boosted walking which brings it in at 10 minutes and the final mile is 15 minutes and uses the toning band. This really makes me work up a sweat and it goes by really quick! As a mom of 3, I appreciate a workout that brings me in at just under an hour and works me hard.

As for all the complaints about Leslie's annoying banter, I can't think of a single work out dvd I have where the host doesn't annoy me from time to time. And I prefer to pick my work out dvds based on how effective the work out is, not by who is hosting it.

This is a winner!! I can't think of a single thing to complain about!! It is a really great workout!!",1350432000,12,855,3.8192090395480225

The second mile is faster and fun.  The 3rd mile involves the bands, the only part I didn't like about this was the part where she all of a sudden stops to stretch with the bands for like a minute and starts right back in - I do not stop to do this - I keep walking and stretching the band because I don't like to stop that abruptly during a power walk.  The bands were interesting because I didn't think you'd really feel what they were supposed to do but Leslie tells you where you should feel it.  I was surprised to realize she was right, you did feel it in your core during one stretch and in the back during another.

3051057,5,B0010V60XY,"I wanted to wait and give this review after I have used this dvd for a month. I must tell you, it is incredible! I have never heard of Leslie Sansone and found out about her by accident on the internet. I wanted a workout dvd with good reviews so I Googled, ""Top ten workout videos"". This is how I found out about Leslie.

I was looking for an ""at home"" workout that was fun and did not require fancy footwork or super skinny fake looking women in the videos. I'm a stay at home mom to an infant and live in a hot, humid area. It's too hot for baby and me to walk and I need a good workout; something I could do at home while the baby took his naps. I was intrigued and made a trip to Walmart to purchase this dvd. I paid less than $10.00 for an AWESOME workout video!!! Do you know what Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, or personal trainers would cost you??? Ten bucks is the best money I could have ever spent on a dvd that will get me in shape and feeling good in my clothing!!! I put the dvd in the player intending to watch the workout first. I did not know what to expect but before I knew it, I was up doing the workout and completed two miles! My heart was pounding like crazy and I was out of breath. I had not worked out 8 months prior to getting this dvd. So yes, I was out of shape. To date, I have not lost any weight (I gained 1/2 pound) I'm certain I have gained muscle. However, I have lost 7 1/4 inches off my body!!! My tummy has been shrinking and my clothes are fitting better. I started using this dvd June 18th and measured and weighed myself on that day. I weighed in on July 20th and lost the 7 1/4 inches. I will weigh in again August 20th. By then I should have lost a few pounds. It' funny, I lose inches before I lose weight. Also, it helps to weigh yourself and monitor your progress each month instead of each week. This keeps me motivated and I can see dramatic results each month. Weekly weigh in's and mearsurements would only discourage me because I would feel my progress should be dramatic. This is easily how one can fall off the wagon.

In summary, this dvd is great for just about everyone. There is some light jogging but it's optional. There is no complicated chorographed fancy footwork, no fake skinny looking women (or men) in this video. The people in this video are the typical average looking adults. The clothing is tasteful without boobs spilling everywhere or tummies hanging out. The music is fine however, I have walked an average of 12 miles per week so I have to mute the tv or turn the volume down low to workout. Already walked 9 miles this week and I'm looking forward to August 20th!",1343260800,4,2634,4.172888015717092

I have been very active throughout my pregnancy (and before), but the bigger my belly grows, the harder it is to maintain the level of activity that I would like. I would love to walk more outside, but the weather has been awful. I use this video on rainy days and it does the job.",1336780800,,336,4.106060606060606
3051059,5,B0010V60XY,I love this workout!!  I started in February of this year and have lost 23 pounds since I started doing this workout about 3 or 4 times a week.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to lose weight.,1336694400,4,201,4.0
3051060,5,B0010V60XY,"This is the 4th Leslie dvd I've bought in the past couple months.  My mom got me into Leslie, and I originally thought I wouldn't like them, and walking videos sounded pretty boring, but Leslie is anything but boring, and it's totally a great workout.  I have already lost 6 pounds in less than a month since walking nearly every day.  I started off walking only 1 mile a day, and now I usually do 5-8 miles (split up into a couple different times a day).  They are so easy, yet effective.

 I love this dvd especially because miles 2 and 3 are really fast! They both include boosted walking (her way of saying jogging).  It's enough to really get your heart rate up, but not too much that you feel overwhelmed.  I am so anti-running, but now that I have been doing Leslie's dvd's I feel like I want to try to do a 5k and then work up from there.  The jogging on this dvd will really help build up endurance for that, I think.  I was able to do this whole dvd at once, and she's not kidding when she says you will work off a whole meal.  Not sure how many calories I burned, but by the end of mile 2, I was already sweating like crazy and I still had 2 miles to go.  And that stretchie band works you more than you'd think.  I will be doing this dvd regularly from now on!  You can also choose to do any of the miles by themselves.  Some may find her ""banter"" annoying, but I love the energy she has, and it keeps me entertained while I work out. I almost forget I'm actually working out because it's fun to ""hang out"" with Leslie and her friends.",1335225600,,1547,4.093023255813954
3051061,4,B0010V60XY,"I usually work up a fairly good sweat doing this, even when I start in the second mile, which I like having the flexibility to do, by the way. It doesn't have the intensity of an interval program, but there is plenty of variety, and I enjoy the cheery chatter, although I can see why others might find it entirely too cutesy. In fact, I still smile every time she says she's going to shut up now ;-) Because she NEVER shuts up, but I don't mind. I have no problem following because I don't pay close attention to the visual, and when I occasionally notice that one of the cast messes up, I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one! I do have one small complaint though, particularly about the band routine. I'm a bit OC about balance, and Leslie doesn't always pay attention to how long she's working one side vs. the other. I've learned to do my own counting and compensate, but that really should be her job, now shouldn't it? Still, it's a fairly minor problem and on the whole I enjoy the program and am glad to have it as a break from my regular routine from time to time.",1332201600,2,1077,4.207729468599034

Sound quality was decent and the music varied, as always the moves were easy to follow, and at the end I felt like I had gotten a strong cardio workout.  If you like aerobic exercise that doesn't cause the joints to ache and you're not a fan of complicated dance steps, this is a fun 50 minute workout.",1331337600,,370,4.211267605633803

I broke a sweat and actually felt the burn.  The workout is more than walking in place.  It incorporates kicks, high leg lifts, side steps and rear leg lifts.  So, there's variation in the walking.

I modify the moves and use light weights for resistance, as I don't like using stretch bands.  There is also some light jogging in this workout, but again, it is very easy to modify if you would rather not jog.  The stretching period of each mile seems a little longer than usual, and somewhat yoga inspired.  Why am I giving 5 stars when I don't follow the whole workout the way it is?

I had run a 1/2 marathon and was looking for something a little less intense but would keep me busy.  Later that year I hurt my knee and this was something that I was able to do again to get me back into shape.  Now I'm using it again to get rid of some holiday weight :-)
I actually prefer this one to WATP most of the time.  Each has its merits.

What I like about this one...  Boosted walking, like I said, ran a 1/2 marathon, so I like the higher intensity.  It is also a wee bit quicker to get through the 4 miles on this one.  This video has some graphics (tummy tuck, boosted walking, etc).

What I don't like so much...  Mary takes over for much of mile 2 and isn't very good at keeping time or maybe it is just coordinating the arms and legs.  She (Mary) switches quickly from one thing to another, like arms up and down to clapping with only a beat or two between.  And as silly as it sounds, they tease they poor guy in the back and I feel bad for him - he takes it just fine though...  Also this video only has the one work out, so if you only want to do 3 miles, you have to fast forward to the end for stretches (or just do your own).  And I'm allergic to latex, so I have to find an alternate during the 4th mile when they use the stretchy bands.

All in all, I use this quite a bit and really enjoy doing it.  definitely recommend.",1326844800,,1678,4.558528428093646

I was wearing a pedometer and it clocked me in at a little over 3 miles. I would not bother with the stretch band they give you. I tried using it with Leslie and she doesn't seem to even know how to use it. It's kind of pathetic. The other walkers are old and some out of shape. I'm sorry it helps when you see fit people working out with you, not old floppy women. That being said, it is an OK cardio program, but very low intensity. Leslie's annoying talking and the camera switching around all the time on these old faces, kind of confusing...turns me off. I will still do this workout, as it's good for home, but it really doesn't burn too many calories and I barely broke a sweat. I will probably switch to less time (30 minutes) and higher intensity cardio. Less time, tougher workout, more efficient.",1326758400,4,963,4.26775956284153
3051068,5,B0010V60XY,"Of all Leslie's dvds I think this is my favorite. I love the gentle jogging at the end of mile 2 as well as two more times in mile 3.

I've lost 40 pounds with Leslie's dvds. I had hoped to graduate to 5 miles, but find her five mile dvds lacking. However, now I just repeat mile 2 or mile 3 before finishing up with mile 4 to make my own 5 mile workout when I'm in the mood. The walkers are old favorites from her other dvds and it's like revisiting family.

Some people don't like Leslie's constant chatter, but I love it. She really brings you into the workout. The walkers have lots of energy and it's loads of fun.

If I had a complaint (and it's minimal) I would say I don't like the camera focusing in on the guy during the third boosted walking. He's out of step (going forward when everyone else is going backwards) and no matter how hard I try, it puts me out of step also. I do better if I close my eyes past the point where I know they show him.

Mile 4 has the band and I love working with it. I'm also glad she doesn't use it during the entire mile. I do wish they had sent me a different color than the ugly lime green! Maybe a pretty pink one like they are using.

Overall, I think this will always be one of my favorites.",1323302400,,1238,3.9558232931726907

I love the DVD.  It is the best at-home workout I have ever tried.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that Leslie is a bit too chit-chatty, but I haven't found that so annoying I couldn't do the workout.  I think she is truly trying to motivate her viewers.  The moves are so easy it really is a no-brainer, but so far they seem to be working.  I was terribly sore the next day after the first workout, but I went ahead and did the workout again the next day.  Now I will be doing my 5th day tomorrow and I am not sore at all.

3051080,4,B0010V60XY,"I have been using this DVD along with other fitness DVDs for a few months now. It is among my favorites, and I do feel that I get a good workout. There are several ""boosts"" during the workout which allows you to break into what Leslie calls ""a gentle jog"" if you so choose. To be honest, I wish there were more of these boosts as I really like those parts the best (Mile 3 has 2 boosts).

The band is not used until Mile 4, and I think it is used just enough. If you decide not to use the band everyday, you'll still keep moving.

What I don't like about the workout is mainly some visual elements. There are some really strange close-up shots of shoes and waists that I don't understand. Also, I wish there was not a brief pause between each mile. I mean, I'm doing the 4 miles straight through without a break, and it would be nice to see that the walkers on the DVD were doing the same. The music is good - yes, you will recognize some of it if you've done other Leslie workouts - and Leslie is her usual talkative self. I will admit that the first time I used this DVD I was very distracted by the fact that some of the songs have lyrics and singers, but I got over it pretty quickly!

Overall, I definitely recommend this one. I'd say it's more for intermediate exercisers. I actually like this a lot better than the 5 mile ""walk like a runner"" DVD.",1320105600,4,1354,4.121212121212121

3051082,5,B0010V60XY,"This is an excellent 4 mile workout- it incorporates everything I want in a workout, including a start-to-finish 4 mile workout, a mile indicator , and using a booster (the stretchy band).  I am just fine with Leslie's dependence on the 4 basic steps (I like repetition, and I also have a very small living room, so I now know just how much room I need to perform all her moves).  At one point, she has Mary Kay lead for a while, which is just fine- it's nice to hear her voice after a zillion years of seeing her sweating and grinning in the background.  There's also a guy who I think is her niece's boyfriend (he has the same look as my husband when I drag him shopping) who looks as if he was shanghied into the video, but is now gamely determined to make the best of it.  Each mile ends with the boosted walking,which I didn't realize when I put it in the player- this is important to me because I prefer to wear a more supportive sports bra with the jogging intervals, and by the time I realized I needed one, it was too late.  Nevertheless, I survived the bouncing and jouncing, and look forward to the weekend, when I'll have a full hour to devote to the workout.  Oh, and the stretchy band arm excercizes are no joke- I thought my arms were getting stronger, but they were no match for what Leslie came up with.",1318982400,7,1320,4.239043824701195

I own several of her workouts, this is one of the harder ones, lots of intervals, really picks the heart rate up.  I also own the 5 mile, this one is actually a little harder than the 5 mile.  You will burn a lot of calories with this one, and it's so cheap!  Just a great nononsense cardio. Be warned however, Leslie can be a little too chipper for those of us that are lazy and don't love to workout, but that's a small price to pay for a good workout.

I'm not really a big bouncy around run jump kind of workout gal..plus i'm not made for that..thanks to gravity...I bought this maybe a month ago and haven't opened it yet..till last night.  By the 3rd mile I was actually thinking of stopping..I usually push myself for instance when doing side steps I squat down quite a bit to get more of a workout and challenge more.  I did do the boosted walk which is really faster walk that leads into a light job..which you do not have to do.  I'm not sore but I can kinda tell I got a nice workout the day before, just didn't kill myself doing it lol.  This is such a do-able workout in about an hour.  I've tried jillian michaels and billy blanks etc.  Their just not for me.  I'd rather spend an hour not killing myself and walk then spend half an hour killing myself and not able to walk for a week.

Yes Leslie's constant banter gets on my nerves.  I know all her moves anyway so normally I mute the tv and have my music playing.  The poor fella in the back I'm not sure if they told him to look uncoordinated purposely or what but he was a bit distracting.  I wasn't sure whether to feel bad for him or embarrassed.  Cuing was a little off but maybe that just makes it that much more real and less choreographed.  It bothered me on one move she was off herself and threw everyone off and its one of her usual moves (which I got a huge kick that Mary done it the correct way - hope i got the right name).

Ive been doing WW's since march and haven't really lost anything..so I'm hoping this will help..she says you will walk off a meal with that workout.  :O)

Have tried to continue the entire 4 miles twice now and may back up a little and work up to the 4 miles but WOW Leslie has helped me to move forward in getting my life back and feeling good about my new joints. There are adjustments to make for joint safety where new hips are concerned but not crossing a body mid-line is easy and even guarding my hips and knee health have helped my legs be stronger and ""work"" better.

Certified exercise leader Leslie Sansone's aerobic exercise DVDs are the best on the market.  They are reliable for weight loss, for diabetics using exercise to control blood glucose levels, and generally to maintain good health.  They are scientifically based and safe, low-impact, while giving you an effective workout.  The famous  cardiologist Dr. Kenneth Cooper who established and developed  the concept of  ""aerobic exercise"", I understand  chose Ms. Sansone to make aerobic exercise DVDs based on his medical research and philosophy.
I particularly like her Walk Slim, Fast & Firm! 4 Really Big Miles, with Ms. Sansone in a cream jogging jacket and white camisole, and part of the DVD and cover in lavender, with an attractive group of exercisers, doing excellent walk and jogging (boosted walking) intervals.  You can select any of the four miles, or any combination or them.  Some of her DVDs allow you to listen to the music only, deleting Leslie Sansone's instructions.  The Leslie Sansone DVDs use lively music selected to get one's heart rate up to ""aerobic exercise"" levels.  The ""beats per minute""  (BPM) are sufficiently rapid that you do break a sweat by the end of one mile or 15 minutes.
Anyone can fit 15 minutes  of exercise a day in  to be healthy.  The benefits of this 15 minutes a day?  Lose weight.  Lower your blood pressure.  Drop your post-meal blood glucose to safe levels from 20 to 40 mg/dl to save your sight, your kidney function and nervous system, defeat insulin resistance, increase insulin sensitivity and avoid becoming a diabetic.  Maintain and increase your brain capacity and functioning.  Produce your own human growth hormone.  Safe and cost-effective, aerobic exercise accomplishes all of this.
The wonder of her exercise DVDs is that you can get a medically sound aerobic exercise workout by just walking, jogging and stretching in a small space, in your home or office, without the need for expensive workout equipment, without the need for a large, open space.
AND:  the price is right.",1303603200,5,2057,5.059523809523809

Some people complain that when she walks alone it is better because she is more focused on when to cue you in.

I really could care less if I am on perfect beat or what not. I am happy that I am just moving and thats that! I find her encouraging as always and I really love the firm band. I can really feel it working my core!

For a beginner or someone who has not worked out in a long time, this would probably be a nice challenge. However, in my regular exercise, I am used to sweating through my clothes. This DVD caused me to sweat very lightly. For this reason, I would say that if you are an avid, hardcore exerciser, this would be good only for a light day (or an off day).

As noted by other reviewers, the cuing is off and if it weren't for the fact that the exercisers are sweating, I'd think that they were yelling ""CUT!"" and tried to string the segments together because there are parts that seems to lack continuity. I also found it odd that Steve is a basketball coach and former player but could not execute the simple moves on this DVD with a high level of accuracy.

Mary Kay leads for a few minutes and at the end, they use a band. The last song, Leslie says she's going to be quiet because she wants the walkers to hear the words to the song...but she doesn't stop talking.

On Weight Watchers for four months and had hit that plateau to where I couldn't move the scale much anymore...this is doing it!  The only thing that would make this DVD perfect would be if it had an option to turn off Leslie's constant chatter.  She talks way more in this one that the other two I have.  By this point we've got the steps, Leslie.  The music is great - it's ok to just lead the workout and leave me to my own thoughts!  Thanks - Lisa",1283126400,3,663,4.290322580645161

Boy, and can you tell the difference!  This is the first of the group I have tried having been exposed to it at an exercise class of St Theresa Catholic Church in Sunny Hills, Florida. As Leslie Sansone herself says ""Even the warm-up is a little peppy.""

I don't know if it is this particular DVD or one of the others I cited but at least one of them introduces the audience to ""boosted walking"" or mild or gentle jogging. Most of this indoor walking tape is done to a 3-4 MPH walking pace. In the second mile it speeds up to a 12 minute mile and in the third mile a 10 minute mile. As Leslie says ""You don't have to worry about following the steps. Just keep pace with the music."" This is so true and so stress relieving. Unlike some of the FIRM tapes where these very young, very skinny instructors force you to learn complex moves just to keep up with them, Leslie's instructions are simple but effective. I can FEEL myself start to sweat! She admits herself:  ""This is not about being perfect. This is about getting a good,healthy workout.""",1279843200,4,2439,7.371134020618556
3051147,5,B0010V60XY,I have many of Leslie's work out DVD's and I love them all.  The three mile ones were getting a bit too easy so I decided to try 4 miles.  This DVD is so fun that I hardly noticed that it was an extra mile.  I worked hard and felt great afterward but it went by very quickly!!  She introduces some new fun moves that made the workout unique from some of the others.  Can't wait to do it tomorrow!!,1275523200,,397,3.9125
3051148,3,B0010V60XY,I love Leslie Sanson Walking Videos.  This particular DVD does not do it for me.  I think it is the music..the very first song turns me off.  I need music that motivates me and makes me want continue to work out just because of the music.  There is only one song in the DVD that I like and it is at mile 4 and it is the last song before the cool down.  I tried using mute but then I get off cue because I don't know when she is going change the steps.  I still do the workout because it is a great workout but I suffer through the music.,1273449600,,537,3.7927927927927927

3051150,5,B0010V60XY,"This is my favorite of her exercise DVD's.  The first mile is 15 minutes & the warm up is a little faster because this is not for beginners; 2nd mile is 12 minutes; 3rd mile is 10 minutes, & the 4th mile is used with the stretchie band.  The 2nd & 3rd miles are fast because boosted walking/mild jogging are done.  I like this DVD so well because you can select from the main menu which mile you want to do.  I prefer doing 1 & 4 miles as I am over 50 & do not really need to jog.  If you prefer to folllow along from 1-3 mile & do not prefer jogging, you can always walk in place & your movements can become exagerated.  By this I mean, that you can do higher kicks & slower kicks than lots of little leg kicks.  She is mindful of limitations that the viewer has a gives helpful pointers throughout the DVD.  To me this is one of the safest exercise programs.  You do have to judge & do this DVD in the way that is right for you.  I notice that my waist tones up with use of this DVD.  You do have to eat sensibly if you are just trying to maintain your weight.  I do not burn up enough calories just doing 2 miles to be able to eat junk food.
I have been using these DVD's for years & was told by my cardiologist that I had actually had an improvement in my echocardiogram & that my cholesterol looked good.  A recent check on BP was excellent.  In fact, the nurse stated that she had never seen BP so good on an older person (I'm in my 50's.  Thank you so very much!)  I am convinced any of Leslie's Walking DVD's do much for the body & its maintenance.",1272412800,,1556,3.9391025641025643
3051151,5,B0010V60XY,"I really love this workout. Leslie is always encouraging and that keeps you pressing forward. The miles go by rather quickly because you aren't just doing simple walking. The variation in movements as you walk allows your 4 miles to fly by, but not without alot of sweat, which is wonderful. Also, the great thing about the program is that you can even go back and do a particular mile several times, so a 4-mile workout could easily turn into 5 or 6, or more. I'm so hooked that I'd love to make time to do this twice-a-day, but for now, I'm excited and quite impressed by the casual, but effective and fun nature of this workout. Thanks Leslie!",1272067200,2,646,4.436974789915967
3051152,4,B0010V60XY,"I'm the kind of girl that DOESN'T lke to work out. After coming back from a hiking trip, I decided that I should start work-out. I came across with this series. It's easy to follow, but does make me sweat a lot. I can see my health condition improved a lot just by doing this for 1 week! I like the way that it divides 4-mile walk into 1-mile mini walks. If I don't have time, I'll just do 1-2 miles, I feel great! I like the part that she integrated strength training into the 4th mile. YES...TONING BAND is included! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that...I'm getting bored and annoyed with Leslie's voice and the music. You'll see what I'm talking about. LOL
Well, I recommend to those of you who are just like me----super lazy, and want a simple work out that helps...",1271980800,,777,4.221476510067114
3051153,5,B0010V60XY,"Since starting to work out with Walk Away the Pounds for Abs in January I have bought and gotten from the library a bunch of different WATP workouts. This one and the 5 mile fat burning walk are so far my favorites because they are brisk (4 kneelifts on Mile 1 already) from start to finish. I like the fast paced music in this one and although at first I wasn't a big fan of Mile 4 because of the stretchie band and the Mambo now I love them plus I noticed how they target muscles differently. I couldn't have done these longer fast paced walks in the beginning so they are definitely for the intermediate.

Her chatter doesn't bother me, sometimes I forget all about it in the high paced workout. Plus I really like her.
My muscles have been getting sore and I've started getting muscle definition and dropped about 14 pounds since I started without really dieting but watching what I eat, and if I'd be better about that I'd lose more. Sometimes I do more upper body exercises with the arms then they do in the DVD and found especially the Hallelujahs are targeting muscles in a way I don't often use them. Great workout, love it.

After having this DVD the 4 mile Walkaway Express Super Challenge and the Walk your Abs flat seem so tame.",1271203200,3,1241,4.367965367965368

The intensity builds at a steady pace..you're not worn out by the 3rd mile, but you are definitely getting a good workout.  The time went by very quickly.  It didn't seem like I was doing it for nearly an hour. I have quite a collection of Leslie's DVD's, and I use ALL of them. This low impact exercise is perfect to burn fat, energize and improve my fitness..all of this without breaking the bank, or straining my joints and back.  I recommend them to everyone.",1270252800,2,628,4.288135593220339
3051155,5,B0010V60XY,"I have used two separate 4mile dvds from Leslie before buying this one. I was curious to see what would be the difference between the stretchie and the band that goes around the stomach. The workout was nice it was fun when she allowed one of the walkers to take over for a while. The stretchie is only used in the last mile and you feel each movement. I enjoy these workouts because you get results safely quickly and permanently once you stick with it. She even has a little dance to keep the fun. My 3yr old son works out with me this is really good.

I think one of the main things with these dvds as Lelsie says you need to watch your calories not starve but watch. Eat in moderation a little of everything yes including junk, to prevent your body from unnecessary cravings. I also use different tapes on different days so you don't get tired of 1 routine.",1269993600,,861,4.282208588957055

3051159,5,B0010V60XY,"I started with Leslie last year and have quite a collection by now, and this one is up there with the tougher ones.  It's a great all-around workout, starts you off pretty easy and then goes into some boosted intervals and finishes up with strength training using the resistance band.  The band workout is a good one, has some great moves for the back especially.  If you're looking to work up a good sweat, this is a great one!",1266192000,,428,4.3924050632911396
3051160,5,B0010V60XY,"My mother bought me this DVD for Christmas in 2008. It sat on my self until I went to a doctors appointment in March of 2009. I weighed 316LBS!!!!! It was at that moment I knew I had to do something. The following day, I began the program, started to watch my portions and that was it. I worked my way up one mile at a time, until I was finally able to do the entire four miles with no problem. Well, it is now Feb. of 2010 and I've lost 71LBS!!!! My whole life has changed. I've dropped so many inches and I have so much energy, I can't wait to go back to the doctor next month and show off my progress. I still have a ways to go, but thank you Leslie and I feel like you are an old friend now. I look forward to working out with you every week. I would definately advice anyone who is serious to GET THIS DVD. I have bought others, like the ""5 Mile Fat Burning Walk"", and this past Christmas I got the ""Ultimate Collection"" which I love as well, but I like to switch off every now and then to add variety. She is really an inspiration and keeps you smiling, motivated, laughing and gives God all the glory..I love those ""Hallelujahs""..hehe. Get the DVDs and you'll know what I'm talking about..hehe.

3051162,4,B0010V60XY,"I've had this DVD for a while and just started doing it again after a hiatus.  Now I remember why I like it so much.  All in all it's close to an hour, but it does go by quickly and it's simple to follow.  And the calorie burn? This morning, my heart rate monitor measured that I burned 637 calories during this workout!  If you work it and you really make an effort, you will get a super cardio, sweaty workout.  If you do this DVD and hardly know you're working out, you're just going through the motions.  You'll still burn calories of course, but as with anything else, you have to give it your all to make it really effective.  There is a lot of chatter, which really doesn't bother me.  What does bother me a bit is during the 4th mile, there are a couple of ""pull down"" exercises with the band that work the back, where Leslie doesn't count and you end up doing more on one side than the other.  But as long as you count yourself, you can make that adjustment.  Otherwise I'd give this workout 5 stars.",1262304000,6,1009,4.181347150259067
3051173,5,B0010V60XY,"This is a total body workout that is exactly what it says, Fast! Leslie is full of energy and keeps the pace moving to get your heart rate up and kick start your metabolism.

3051175,5,B0010V60XY,"I have done several of the WATP videos and this one is just FUN! 4 miles that everyone is really sweating!! I like that the 4th mile you are using the stretch band that is included. Adds a different element to her workout. The intervals of jogging and kicking (which you do while jogging in place) are fantastic and really increase the intensity.

Leslie Sansone is so energetic and positive which I love. She has a great body, but is not perfect. She is REAL!

Give it a try, this will not disappoint. Leslie herself says this workout is the BEST she has done on DVD!",1260316800,,568,4.349056603773585
3051176,5,B0010V60XY,"I enjoy this DVD alot.  It is divided into 4 miles.  Even if you have a really busy day, it is nice to put it on, and get one mile in (only takes 15 min).  You feel better all day.  I love how the background people in the DVD make ""mistakes"" like getting off beat or kicking with the opposite leg,  and they didn't edit it out.  She says throughout the video to keep moving, and doing it exact isn't the point.  That is not to say that the DVD is done sloppily, because it isn't.  It just reflects their attitude that if you keep moving you are accomplishing the goal.",1256083200,,568,4.054054054054054
3051177,4,B0010V60XY,"This is a great workout DVD, but the commentary is annoying.  I've never purchased a Leslie Sansone DVD and since I work out with many different DVD's by other exercise gurus, I wanted to have a change.  The workout raises your heart rate and the DVD gets progressively more intense as the workout continues. I like the addition of the stretch band as well.  The music is great and the hour goes by very quickly.  Leslie explains the steps before hand so you know what you are doing and she is very encouraging.

There is a guy on the floor who is struggling to keep up with everyone else.  He is perspiring profusely at the end of the workout and he admits that it was quite an exercise routine.

But her commentary.  It is frantic, hyper and incessant.  She makes the most ridiculous comments (even calling the guy I mentioned above ""doll face""). I don't know what she is like on her other DVD's, but after awhile, you really have to tune her out.  She never stops talking.

If you can get beyond the commentary, you'll have a great workout.  Wish I could have given it five stars...but the commentary just put me over the edge.",1255478400,7,1130,4.432038834951456

There is enough variety in the different miles so it isn't boring. Yes, Leslie is chatty as usual but it does not distract as it can in other videos. And, I liked the firming mile at the end. All in all, an outstanding workout.",1254614400,,389,4.064935064935065

I have been purchasing her tapes/videos for more than 20 years, and she continues to improve.  This workout works all parts of the body.

3051182,5,B0010V60XY,"This DVD is a great way to get a good workout in fairly quickly and (if using hand weights) can provide both aerobic exercise and strength training.  This is an easy-to-follow walk-at-home DVD that has four basic moves:  kicking, side-step, knee-lift, and walking.  The workout consists of:
*a 15-minute mile
*a 12-minute mile
*a 10-minute mile
*a 15-minute mile working with the included fitness band
*a cool down

The miles are all marked so one can skip to the desired mile with ease.  I often will go right to the 12 and 10 minute miles (repeating some within a given workout) so I can get the right workout for me.  I also use hand weights while I do the exercises (not included but bought at a local sporting goods store) to make the workout a challenge.  Over time I continue to increase the weight of the hand weights.  If one is new to working out, the basic workout (without weights) is a good place to start; the weights allow one to enhance the workout as one progresses.",1248220800,2,983,4.5141242937853105

I did find the bantering started to irritate me after a while.  It almost hurt my ears so I had to try and tune them out and focus on the movement.  The music is pretty much the same music :(  I haven't heard New Attitude on any of her others but it probably is.  I like how each mile got faster and the added boosts which I have done on her other dvds.  I just really really enjoyed it after I was finished and will now add this once per week to my fitness program.

If anyone has Wii, you have got to buy the EA Sports ACTIVE!  And use it on the days that you need a break from Leslie (though I love her and think she's absolutely the BEST workout video to follow ever!!!!)  Wii Fit and Leslie got me off my butt and I've lost 49 pounds since Jan 11th.  Losing at a nice steady rate and can really see the muscle tone change in my arms and legs and thanks to Leslie I can actually RUN 2.4 miles on my treadmill at 5.0 to 6.0 speed.  Each week it increases a smidge.  But I AM RUNNING!!!!  Who knew :)

It's also nice to see them go straight through the 4 miles and ACTUALLY SWEAT!  In her other dvds I never would see her glow at all and in this one they're all dripping!

Only buy this if you've done her others.  You can't really start with this one unless you're already pretty fit and know her moves.",1243036800,3,1484,3.956081081081081

I really felt like I got an effective work out with this program. Leslie calls it ""walking"" but there are kicks and jogging and even some toning included in the 4th mile. This DVD has everything and there is no excuse not to do it. It couldn't be more easy. I have found a new series to add to my home fitness collection :)",1237161600,7,622,4.10655737704918

She often states that her workouts are not for sissies and that is very true but REALLY anyone can do them. You just set your own pace. I started working out with Leslie's videos on April 1st, 2008. I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12. My goal is to lose 100 lbs and I know I will get there. When I started out I could barely get to the end of the 3 mile video. I'm up to 5 miles now and I love it! I'm hooked! What a great thing to be addicted to...excerize!!! Now here's the best part....I'm 62..I'll be 63 in just a few days and the young girls who work out with me can't keep up!!! Please do yourself a huge favor and get started walking away the pounds today. Or just do it to be healthier. Either way, you come out a winner!!!",1235433600,42,917,3.882978723404255

3051243,3,B0010V60XY,"I have been alternating this dvd with the 4 mile express super challenge 3-5 times a week since mid october of '08. it is a great workout, but i like the super challenge better. leslie just seems more calm and encouraging on that one.

i hate to be negative because she's all about being positive, but her banter in this dvd is on the verge of being spastic with a tinge of hysteria. i don't know. she just keeps talking and talking and talking. and it's not as much helpful info as just grating. ""lyn, did us agitate you?"" ""you're generating body heat on my sisters"" ""you should wear it (the stretchie band) as a belt"" ""keep moving dollface"" ""i can't help thinking there goes someone's china cabinet"" these and other comments said in various degrees of baby talk and high pitched squeaks makes the video feel manic. it's hard to concentrate on what is really an effective physical workout. call it being peppy if you will, i call it overdone and annoying.

this video is also hard to watch. it looks like the high school a/v club tried to shoot it. there's quite a few blurry, extreme closeups of the walkers' faces as they try to smile while dripping sweat, and crazy random shots of people's waists. also there are at least two times where the moves change but you can't see it because the camera is trained on someone's feet or hips. also, everyone has trouble keeping in step, especially some of the newbies and the poor guy in the back. (seriously, did they have to give him a pink stretchie?) but of course, staying in step is not so important as just moving, as the WATP mantra goes.

there's a few long pauses between music which really seem amateur considering how many videos this company has made. which is too bad, because i like the music. it's just hard to get into it because the woman won't be quiet!

i don't want to give up on the WATP program, because i have been seeing results from doing these workouts. i've ordered the 5 mile dvd to see if maybe that can take the place of this dvd. i may have to just sit down one day and make my own cd of music to play so i can just mute the dvd and follow the workout...

and it is a good strong workout, a good balance between arms and legs. i don't do the skips during the boosted walking; i just jog in place through it all. the stretchie band makes it interesting. even though it's as long as the 4 mile super challenge, it feels as if it goes by faster.

so, if you can stand the incessant dialogue, you can get a good advanced workout.",1232409600,40,2502,4.312765957446809
3051244,5,B0010V60XY,"I bought my first set of Walk at Home dvds about a year ago and I just love them.  I always feel like I've gotten a good workout, even if I only have time to do two miles.  I've never been crazy about heavily choreographed workout dvds so this one is perfect.  I did it once or twice with the sound on, and now I just put it on mute and play my own music while I walk along with it.  The moves are easy to pick up and easy to follow.  It works for all age groups and all ability levels. I'd really recommend it.
Also, I really like the instructor.  Ms. Sansone seems very nice and positive.  I'm not big on ""tough love"" and some popular instructors turn me off with their aggressive ways.  I know that works for some people, but I hate feeling like I'm being bullied by a dvd.  Ms. Sansone is very polite and perky (she may be a bit too perky for some), so she's an instructor I don't mind seeing everyday.
Good luck with your workouts! :^)",1232409600,,940,4.037837837837838

3051250,4,B0010V60XY,"Owning several Leslie Sansone DVD's, this is one I currently use on Mondays and Fridays.  It really gets the heart rate up and the stretchy band works muscles.  I love the boosted walking (jogging) - I don't do the kicks, just keep jogging back and forth for that session.  I also love the additional moves - lots of tap outs, the grapevine, and such.  I'm not sure why kickbacks aren't included in what she calls her basic moves, since they do them in almost every DVD.  Some cons:  her cuing isn't her best, and some of the arm motions don't work with the leg movements.  She has Mary Kay lead for about 5 minutes on the second mile -- I really would have preferred Leslie do it all.  Leslie continually talks, even when she says she's going to be quiet, she never stops.  The background is all black except for 5 panels in back and the stage.  And since everyone is in black pants (which I hate since it obscures leg movements), when the camera angle has the black background, all you see is the head and arms (and maybe the top) moving!  The camera guys and editors did an amateurish job with the shots and editing -- you'll be looking a feet or a torso as movements change and you haven't a clue what is going on.  However, all in all, this is a great work out and a wonderful start to one's day!",1230595200,7,1301,4.26530612244898

Like many of her other longer workouts, you can do as many miles as you please, and her banter with her other walkers is fun to watch.  But the real reason I love this workout is because every mile is different.  The first mile is traditional, the second mile is a power mile that's faster, and then comes my favorite--the boosted mile where you do jogging intervals.  The fourth mile uses her stretchie band; while it's good, I would much rather use weights than the band, and don't feel like that mile is all that challenging for me.  However, it's still good, and I love the variety.  All the moves are simple, easy to follow, and it really gets your heart rate up during those middle miles.

I didn't expect to like this - but I didn't want to lose any progress I had made and decided to try it (endure it) until the weather got better.  But I was completely taken by surprise at how much I enjoyed (and enjoy) this video.  I love Leslie - and I don't really understand it.  She giggles, cheers you on - has the kind of personality that might in another context be completely annoying.  But I look forward to walking with her every morning and feel like her group is family.  I also have reaped unexpected physical benefits - I feel better than I ever have and have lost more weight in this last month than the whole rest of my walking year.

She has a ""boosted walking"" segment, she leads into that is a nice comfortable jog with little leg kicks.  I find this an excellent addition to the walk in place, knee lifts, kicks, and arm movements.
She stipulates that you can walk away at least one full meal with this particular series.  I believe it.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and have lost almost 6 pounds with this video!

She isn't kidding.  This is a real workout.  The first mile is great and I made it through without killing myself.  The second mile is harder; didn't make mile 3 or 4.  That gives me something to shoot for, I guess.  I love the jogging in place; I was a runner when I was in my 30s and *nothing* is better for staying slim while eating pretty much whatever I want.

The first mile is about 15 minutes, followed by mile two in about 12 minutes and mile three in 10 minutes.  The fourth mile uses a stretch exercise band and takes about 15 minutes.

I love the fact that it's more than 30 minutes, as most of us older chicks need at least 45 minutes of exercise to burn calories. This did the trick for me! I've lost over 21 pounds in 3 months.",1219968000,10,354,3.9305555555555554

I recommend this to everyone!!!",1219968000,3,321,3.735294117647059
3051316,5,B0010V60XY,I have lots of Leslie's DVDs but this one has to be the best. Some of the older ones had gotten too easy -- but this one bumps it up a notch (or two).  I must admit I haven't been able to make it to 4 miles yet.  The music has improved.  It's a great work out for those that want to work out at home and you can make it as easy or as difficult as you are capable of doing.  There is no excuse for not walking - and with Leslie you sure can.,1219881600,,440,3.5520833333333335
3051317,5,B0010V60XY,"This workout is alot of fun and definately a good workout.  I have several of Leslies dvd's and was looking for one that was more challenging than what I had.  This is it.  She includes the usual walk steps from her other dvds, but also adds things like ""grapevines"", ""boosted walking""(light jog), and even a mambo move.  Also mile 4 uses the firm band, which was included with my dvd from Amazon.  A great workout!",1218931200,3,415,4.48

3051319,2,B0010V60XY,"Even though this is a great workout. I'm disappointed that it's just like Super Challenge. Same music and routine, just different people.  When I watched the sample trailer it shows Leslie by herself and doing other exercise routine such as the squat with the stretchy.  I was really looking forward to the workout.

That's the reason for the 2 star score.  I feel dupped into buying a workout dvd, opening the package and once it's opened you can't return it.  Oh well, I've decided to give it away.",1218153600,29,500,4.636363636363637

3051324,4,B0010V60XY,I have at least 25 of Leslie Sansone's Video and DVD. I many of the older out print like walk away the stress the 1 mile for abs etc. I wish she would put those on DVD. This one is one of her best. Yes she talks no stop for almost an hour. She uses her basic 4 steps but it goes by fast. I like the music she uses for her 4 the mile. I wish she would use it more often. I am thankful for Leslie because she gets those of us up and out of the chair. It has been because of Leslie that I have been able to at the Firm into my routine. And I am using the older firm tapes/dvds and they are long.... but thanks to leslie I am keeping up. I will say this about Leslie Sansone I feel like I know her and her walk leaders.,1215388800,6,715,3.6193548387096772
3051325,5,B0010V60XY,"Leslie is in rare form, if you will pardon the pun. I am so glad she did most of the work out herself. She had different people with her some young some old. I have a bad back so I have to just walk on occassion, some days I can do the whole thing, it depends on the day,  and she is very forgiving and lets you know that, she isn't as structured or phony like most fitness ""guru's"". This is my 4th tape, plus I go to exercise on demand and do those as well. I love them all. Again, anyone that is that ""real"" and cares that much is ok with me, and I am staying fit. At 60 it is getting a little more difficult. She does an excellent job, I give this one, which is a good mixture of work outs. 5 stars. Love it and love her.",1215302400,6,724,3.763157894736842
3051326,5,B0010V60XY,I would have to say this is a superb workout its fun it goes by real quick and it really makes you sweat.

I am a huge fan of Leslie's and I really enjoy doing this workout so do yourself a favour and purchase this one.,1215129600,4,315,3.90625

This video is the best Leslie Sansone video I own. I also wore my polar heart rate monitor. I must tell you that I was getting the workout of my life. I loved every second of it. My heart rate reached up to 170. I felt like I was running instead of walking in place. I am hooked on Leslie Sansone, she rocks.

3051330,5,B0010V60XY,"I have quite a few of Leslie's DVD workouts, and this is one of my favorites. I like that it is quick (4 miles in about 50 minutes) and low impact. Even the boosted sections, where you're running or doing one of the other modified steps, are not hard on joints or muscles.

I love the interaction between Leslie and the other walkers, many have been in her other DVDs. It is like walking with old friends.

This DVD, and the others in Leslie's series, have gotten me through several winters, helping me stay in shape without having to find time and energy to head to the gym.",1212364800,12,575,4.314814814814815

Like many others who have submitted reviews, I had long since given up a regular exercise regimen due to lack of time and location (cold/dark 6 months out of 12)  I started with a 2 mile workout and then purchased this DVD and others to make the best use of my time.  I now own 7 in total.  This one of the better ones and gives a great workout, but is not equipped with ""music only"" mode, which will be required by those who find Leslie's constant conversation a bit much if you use these DVD's every day like I do.  Instead, I mute my computer and use with my IPOD and my own exercise music.  Works like a charm!",1211760000,16,702,4.201492537313433
3285338,5,B0010V60XY,I've been using this DVD for a week now & I love it! I've been working out to Leslie's videos for a number of years now and I love them! I've tried other exercise videos but ended up being frustrated when I couldn't follow the choreography. Not with Leslie's videos they are the BEST! This Walk Slim 4 mile is AWESOME!

I have owned it for 6 days now and I started walking the total 4 miles after 2 days. I did not think the 3 mile walk (pink case) could be beat and I still love it, however this is my all time favorite! I am not really crazy about the music on one of the miles otherwise you go Leslie, and keep those exercise videos coming! You are my hero.",1210550400,5,516,3.7777777777777777

This one is my new favorite!  Believe me, it will get you in shape and I NEVER exercised before Leslie.  It's the real deal!",1210377600,110,437,3.9655172413793105
3285341,5,B0010V60XY,"I have one other 4 mile walk (the old Weight Loss Walk--I recommend it if you can find it) and this is a nice addition.  It does contain ""boosted walking"" (light jogging) but I stick to power walking and still feel like I am getting a good workout.  Leslie is a little silly at times and she interrupts Mary Kay's part of the walk a bit too much for my taste but the strength of the workout overcomes the weaknesses.",1210377600,9,416,4.1875
3285342,5,B0010V60XY,"I only have a few of Leslie's workouts, but they are all good and fun and easy to do while burning off a lot of fat.  As each of these miles goes, they get faster and faster.  The first mile is easier and it builds in intensity till you're really getting your heart rate right up there.  At mile three, that's when you start to add some gentle jogging and then at mile four, you're using resistance bands (optional) to work your upper body and also maximise the fat burning and your heart rate.
Leslie is a terrific cuer and she is motivating and friendly.  She's always encouraging and that pushes you through when you think you really want to quit.  I find this workout easy yet calorie burning and I have no hesitation in recommending it to almost anyone who wants to lose weight and burn fat.  You'll have fun while doing it so you'll hardly know you're working out.  I love it.",1210291200,102,882,4.341463414634147
3285343,5,B0010V60XY,"I love this workout!
I love the fact that is chaptered.
I do mile 1, mile 2, mile 3, then I press the back button on my dvd to repeat mile 3 and then hit back twice and redo mile 1.
I tend to skip mile 4 because I enjoy being able to do a full sixty minutes of cardio without any boosters (the stretchie band).
Doing the sequence of mile 1, mile 2, mile 3, mile 3 and mile 1 gives me 62 minutes of solid cardio in my living room.
I love the fact that I can modify this workout to suit my needs.
I do not jog during the 3 ninety second jogging intervals, I just march in place. But the song used during the interval is fast paced so I do increase my marching pace for 90 seconds.
Also, some days, I repeat mile 1 four times for a good solid 4 mile walk.
Or, if I am strapped for time, I just do mile 1. It's a good solid mile with lots of arm movements.
This is my favorite Leslie Sansone workout of all time!",1210032000,48,908,3.7842105263157895

I am so glad she is my personal trainer for pennies a day and I don't have to drive anywhere!  I look forward to her walks every day and I intend to do this kind of exercise the rest of my life!  It's a no brainer--put in the tape, rain or shine, day or night, hot or cold and WALK!  Start with a mile and work up as you become more fit and you will become more fit if you stick with it.  Consistency is the key.  Everyone has 15-30 mins. a day. Leslie promises: ""you can get fit in minutes a day and you will reach your goals if you don't quit!""  She delivers and I'm living proof!  I feel like I know Leslie, Joanne, Linda, Carol and my favorite speedwalker, Mary Kay (she's high energy!) My walking buddies!  I pop in the tape and report for my personal fitness class right in my bedroom! If it wasn't for Leslie, I would still be struggling with my weight, looking for the next diet, and trying to find attractive clothes that fit!  This is no longer a problem for me!  I own a stack of Leslies tapes and choose whatever I want on a particular day.

This entire ""Walk Fit"" series is excellent!  I couldn't wait for this one so I purchased it directly on Leslie's website.  This one is so much fun!  If you're a newbie to walking, you may want to do just 1 mile at first and build up. Boy, does the time fly!  When you finish, expect to be sweating!  You can feel the weight come off effortlessly without starving yourself too!",1208995200,38,1515,4.147766323024055

The 2nd mile is 10 mins. so you do Boosted Walking which is jogging in place. This is a good workout, 4 miles in about 54 mins. I'm not crazy about the music but it doesn't matter because I use picture in picture and watch a TV show instead.

I like this one because it is broken up into segments and you can mix them up depending on your schedule or you energy level on any particular day.  I didn't give this 5 stars for a couple of reasons.  First off, some of the music is awful.  I don't know if it is my TV or what, but in the first mile the song after the warm up I am constantly stopping to try and find the beat because I just can't hear it.  And the song for the boosted walking?  Sounds like my old record player when I would change the speed to super fast in the middle of a song.  (I know, I know....some kid reading this just went, ""What?"")  Some of the cues are off with the steps, which I know happens, but this isn't her first DVD.  And the talking.....oh my.....I should be used to this by now, but wow.  Near the end, she says she's going to stop talking so we can hear the song playing.  Yeah, no.... there is no stopping of the talking.  I did like when Mary took over part of the instructing.  She did a great job!

Similarly, my husband is in great shape with no ailments and he does this video with me with greater intensity and force and he LOVES the video. He started doing the video with me as encouragment, once I was out of my back brace and able to do workouts.

Plus she seems less annoying in this one than in her others (ie, she doesn't rant and rave about how much she loves sweat in this one ... that's really tiring). I like how her moves are simple in this one (no silly dance moves or difficult aerobics) yet it's incredibly effective. The downside is that I have owned 2 DVDs so far and they both skip and freeze in the 2nd mile. None of my other DVDs skip so I think it's due to poor quality.",1447459200,,519,4.098039215686274

3285412,4,B0010V60XY,"I'm an advanced walker and credit Leslie Sansone (and weight watchers) for helping me lose 85 lbs and get to my perfect weight and keep it off for five years.  I own about 20 DVD's by Leslie and do one a day.  This DVD makes a good Saturday workout when you have a little extra time, it's an hour long.  It's an enjoyable workout and goes by quickly.  The music is fun and is at a good volume and it really helps keep you motivated.  Leslie mainly uses the four standard walking steps - walking, side-steps, knee lifts, kicks, and ""kickbacks"" - in this workout.  In the fourth mile she does a decent workout for the upper body using the stretchy band.  The only negative I can think of is she does some standing bicep curls during this mile and doesn't quite give you enough time to set yourself up for them.  Also, I don't like when a walking workout breaks up the flow by incorporating any standing toning movies.  I prefer to save those for a short session after the walking workout or devote an hour a couple times during the week for a good weight lifting session.  If you've got a good sweat going and are in the flow of the workout, don't break it up by suddenly standing still and doing bicep curls.  That's just my opinion.  This break-up in the routine during this one short segment is the only reason I knocked this workout down from five stars to four.  Leslie mainly keeps this workout at low impact but, in the the third mile she does do intervals of high impact ""boosted walking"".  Of course, you can keep it low impact if you want.  It's only three cycles.  She does incorporate a couple easy Yoga moves during the stretching segment which is always nice.  As an advanced walker, this workout gets me in a decent sweat if I really work it hard but it doesn't get me out of breath or make me feel like I'm breaking a plateau.  I think it's an excellent and fun workout for those trying to loose weight or those, like me, just trying to stay in shape.  I recommed this one.",1441411200,10,1987,4.307277628032345

More moves thrown in (toe tapping and diagonal knee-lifts) -nothing that I couldn't fall into right away.

It's possible to just do one or two workouts, but there's no cool-down, so stopping at one mile will leave one fairly breathless for a couple of minutes.

It goes really, really fast. If you're out of shape or stiff, it will be a good idea to work up to multiple miles.

This really fits the bill. I used her simpler workouts in the past, but find them way too sedate now. The pace on this one is picked up and the moves are stronger, and you can push up your own intensity (sitting lower, lifting your legs higher, and adding a little power on some moves) to make this even more challenging if it gets easy. Or if you've hit it really hard the day before, and you just want a some movement to warm you up, burn some calories and then stretch, you can do that as well. On days when I do 30-40 minutes of a serious strength workout, I get four options for a single mile to do after for some cardio that doesn't kill me.

It is 4 miles, the first mile is a classic 15 minute mile, the second is a faster paced 12 minute mile, the third mile has a lot of boosted walking which brings it in at 10 minutes and the final mile is 15 minutes and uses the toning band. This really makes me work up a sweat and it goes by really quick! As a mom of 3, I appreciate a workout that brings me in at just under an hour and works me hard.

As for all the complaints about Leslie's annoying banter, I can't think of a single work out dvd I have where the host doesn't annoy me from time to time. And I prefer to pick my work out dvds based on how effective the work out is, not by who is hosting it.

This is a winner!! I can't think of a single thing to complain about!! It is a really great workout!!",1350432000,12,855,3.8192090395480225

The second mile is faster and fun.  The 3rd mile involves the bands, the only part I didn't like about this was the part where she all of a sudden stops to stretch with the bands for like a minute and starts right back in - I do not stop to do this - I keep walking and stretching the band because I don't like to stop that abruptly during a power walk.  The bands were interesting because I didn't think you'd really feel what they were supposed to do but Leslie tells you where you should feel it.  I was surprised to realize she was right, you did feel it in your core during one stretch and in the back during another.

3285554,5,B0010V60XY,"I wanted to wait and give this review after I have used this dvd for a month. I must tell you, it is incredible! I have never heard of Leslie Sansone and found out about her by accident on the internet. I wanted a workout dvd with good reviews so I Googled, ""Top ten workout videos"". This is how I found out about Leslie.

I was looking for an ""at home"" workout that was fun and did not require fancy footwork or super skinny fake looking women in the videos. I'm a stay at home mom to an infant and live in a hot, humid area. It's too hot for baby and me to walk and I need a good workout; something I could do at home while the baby took his naps. I was intrigued and made a trip to Walmart to purchase this dvd. I paid less than $10.00 for an AWESOME workout video!!! Do you know what Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, or personal trainers would cost you??? Ten bucks is the best money I could have ever spent on a dvd that will get me in shape and feeling good in my clothing!!! I put the dvd in the player intending to watch the workout first. I did not know what to expect but before I knew it, I was up doing the workout and completed two miles! My heart was pounding like crazy and I was out of breath. I had not worked out 8 months prior to getting this dvd. So yes, I was out of shape. To date, I have not lost any weight (I gained 1/2 pound) I'm certain I have gained muscle. However, I have lost 7 1/4 inches off my body!!! My tummy has been shrinking and my clothes are fitting better. I started using this dvd June 18th and measured and weighed myself on that day. I weighed in on July 20th and lost the 7 1/4 inches. I will weigh in again August 20th. By then I should have lost a few pounds. It' funny, I lose inches before I lose weight. Also, it helps to weigh yourself and monitor your progress each month instead of each week. This keeps me motivated and I can see dramatic results each month. Weekly weigh in's and mearsurements would only discourage me because I would feel my progress should be dramatic. This is easily how one can fall off the wagon.

In summary, this dvd is great for just about everyone. There is some light jogging but it's optional. There is no complicated chorographed fancy footwork, no fake skinny looking women (or men) in this video. The people in this video are the typical average looking adults. The clothing is tasteful without boobs spilling everywhere or tummies hanging out. The music is fine however, I have walked an average of 12 miles per week so I have to mute the tv or turn the volume down low to workout. Already walked 9 miles this week and I'm looking forward to August 20th!",1343260800,4,2634,4.172888015717092

3285557,5,B0010V60XY,"This is the 4th Leslie dvd I've bought in the past couple months.  My mom got me into Leslie, and I originally thought I wouldn't like them, and walking videos sounded pretty boring, but Leslie is anything but boring, and it's totally a great workout.  I have already lost 6 pounds in less than a month since walking nearly every day.  I started off walking only 1 mile a day, and now I usually do 5-8 miles (split up into a couple different times a day).  They are so easy, yet effective.

 I love this dvd especially because miles 2 and 3 are really fast! They both include boosted walking (her way of saying jogging).  It's enough to really get your heart rate up, but not too much that you feel overwhelmed.  I am so anti-running, but now that I have been doing Leslie's dvd's I feel like I want to try to do a 5k and then work up from there.  The jogging on this dvd will really help build up endurance for that, I think.  I was able to do this whole dvd at once, and she's not kidding when she says you will work off a whole meal.  Not sure how many calories I burned, but by the end of mile 2, I was already sweating like crazy and I still had 2 miles to go.  And that stretchie band works you more than you'd think.  I will be doing this dvd regularly from now on!  You can also choose to do any of the miles by themselves.  Some may find her ""banter"" annoying, but I love the energy she has, and it keeps me entertained while I work out. I almost forget I'm actually working out because it's fun to ""hang out"" with Leslie and her friends.",1335225600,,1547,4.093023255813954

It doesn't have the intensity of an interval program, but there is plenty of variety, and I enjoy the cheery chatter, although I can see why others might find it entirely too cutesy. In fact, I still smile every time she says she's going to shut up now ;-) Because she NEVER shuts up, but I don't mind. I have no problem following because I don't pay close attention to the visual, and when I occasionally notice that one of the cast messes up, I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one! I do have one small complaint though, particularly about the band routine. I'm a bit OC about balance, and Leslie doesn't always pay attention to how long she's working one side vs. the other. I've learned to do my own counting and compensate, but that really should be her job, now shouldn't it? Still, it's a fairly minor problem and on the whole I enjoy the program and am glad to have it as a break from my regular routine from time to time.",1332201600,2,1077,4.207729468599034

I modify the moves and use light weights for resistance, as I don't like using stretch bands.  There is also some light jogging in this workout, but again, it is very easy to modify if you would rather not jog.

I had run a 1/2 marathon and was looking for something a little less intense but would keep me busy.  Later that year I hurt my knee and this was something that I was able to do again to get me back into shape.  Now I'm using it again to get rid of some holiday weight :-)
I actually prefer this one to WATP most of the time.  Each has its merits.

What I like about this one...  Boosted walking, like I said, ran a 1/2 marathon, so I like the higher intensity.  It is also a wee bit quicker to get through the 4 miles on this one.  This video has some graphics (tummy tuck, boosted walking, etc).

What I don't like so much...  Mary takes over for much of mile 2 and isn't very good at keeping time or maybe it is just coordinating the arms and legs.  She (Mary) switches quickly from one thing to another, like arms up and down to clapping with only a beat or two between.  And as silly as it sounds, they tease they poor guy in the back and I feel bad for him - he takes it just fine though...  Also this video only has the one work out, so if you only want to do 3 miles, you have to fast forward to the end for stretches (or just do your own).  And I'm allergic to latex, so I have to find an alternate during the 4th mile when they use the stretchy bands.

All in all, I use this quite a bit and really enjoy doing it.  definitely recommend.",1326844800,,1678,4.558528428093646

I was wearing a pedometer and it clocked me in at a little over 3 miles. I would not bother with the stretch band they give you. I tried using it with Leslie and she doesn't seem to even know how to use it. It's kind of pathetic. The other walkers are old and some out of shape. I'm sorry it helps when you see fit people working out with you, not old floppy women. That being said, it is an OK cardio program, but very low intensity. Leslie's annoying talking and the camera switching around all the time on these old faces, kind of confusing...turns me off. I will still do this workout, as it's good for home, but it really doesn't burn too many calories and I barely broke a sweat. I will probably switch to less time (30 minutes) and higher intensity cardio. Less time, tougher workout, more efficient.",1326758400,4,963,4.26775956284153
3285565,5,B0010V60XY,"Of all Leslie's dvds I think this is my favorite. I love the gentle jogging at the end of mile 2 as well as two more times in mile 3.

I've lost 40 pounds with Leslie's dvds. I had hoped to graduate to 5 miles, but find her five mile dvds lacking. However, now I just repeat mile 2 or mile 3 before finishing up with mile 4 to make my own 5 mile workout when I'm in the mood. The walkers are old favorites from her other dvds and it's like revisiting family.

Some people don't like Leslie's constant chatter, but I love it. She really brings you into the workout. The walkers have lots of energy and it's loads of fun.

If I had a complaint (and it's minimal) I would say I don't like the camera focusing in on the guy during the third boosted walking. He's out of step (going forward when everyone else is going backwards) and no matter how hard I try, it puts me out of step also. I do better if I close my eyes past the point where I know they show him.

Mile 4 has the band and I love working with it. I'm also glad she doesn't use it during the entire mile. I do wish they had sent me a different color than the ugly lime green! Maybe a pretty pink one like they are using.

Overall, I think this will always be one of my favorites.",1323302400,,1238,3.9558232931726907

I do agree with some of the other reviewers that Leslie is a bit too chit-chatty, but I haven't found that so annoying I couldn't do the workout.  I think she is truly trying to motivate her viewers.  The moves are so easy it really is a no-brainer, but so far they seem to be working.

3285577,4,B0010V60XY,"I have been using this DVD along with other fitness DVDs for a few months now. It is among my favorites, and I do feel that I get a good workout. There are several ""boosts"" during the workout which allows you to break into what Leslie calls ""a gentle jog"" if you so choose. To be honest, I wish there were more of these boosts as I really like those parts the best (Mile 3 has 2 boosts).

The band is not used until Mile 4, and I think it is used just enough. If you decide not to use the band everyday, you'll still keep moving.

What I don't like about the workout is mainly some visual elements. There are some really strange close-up shots of shoes and waists that I don't understand. Also, I wish there was not a brief pause between each mile. I mean, I'm doing the 4 miles straight through without a break, and it would be nice to see that the walkers on the DVD were doing the same. The music is good - yes, you will recognize some of it if you've done other Leslie workouts - and Leslie is her usual talkative self. I will admit that the first time I used this DVD I was very distracted by the fact that some of the songs have lyrics and singers, but I got over it pretty quickly!

Overall, I definitely recommend this one. I'd say it's more for intermediate exercisers. I actually like this a lot better than the 5 mile ""walk like a runner"" DVD.",1320105600,4,1354,4.121212121212121

I am just fine with Leslie's dependence on the 4 basic steps (I like repetition, and I also have a very small living room, so I now know just how much room I need to perform all her moves).  At one point, she has Mary Kay lead for a while, which is just fine- it's nice to hear her voice after a zillion years of seeing her sweating and grinning in the background.  There's also a guy who I think is her niece's boyfriend (he has the same look as my husband when I drag him shopping) who looks as if he was shanghied into the video, but is now gamely determined to make the best of it.  Each mile ends with the boosted walking,which I didn't realize when I put it in the player- this is important to me because I prefer to wear a more supportive sports bra with the jogging intervals, and by the time I realized I needed one, it was too late.  Nevertheless, I survived the bouncing and jouncing, and look forward to the weekend, when I'll have a full hour to devote to the workout.

You will burn a lot of calories with this one, and it's so cheap!  Just a great nononsense cardio.

I'm not really a big bouncy around run jump kind of workout gal..plus i'm not made for that..thanks to gravity...I bought this maybe a month ago and haven't opened it yet..till last night.  By the 3rd mile I was actually thinking of stopping..I usually push myself for instance when doing side steps I squat down quite a bit to get more of a workout and challenge more.  I did do the boosted walk which is really faster walk that leads into a light job..which you do not have to do.  I'm not sore but I can kinda tell I got a nice workout the day before, just didn't kill myself doing it lol.  This is such a do-able workout in about an hour.  I've tried jillian michaels and billy blanks etc.  Their just not for me.  I'd rather spend an hour not killing myself and walk then spend half an hour killing myself and not able to walk for a week.

Yes Leslie's constant banter gets on my nerves.  I know all her moves anyway so normally I mute the tv and have my music playing.  The poor fella in the back I'm not sure if they told him to look uncoordinated purposely or what but he was a bit distracting.  I wasn't sure whether to feel bad for him or embarrassed.  Cuing was a little off but maybe that just makes it that much more real and less choreographed.  It bothered me on one move she was off herself and threw everyone off and its one of her usual moves (which I got a huge kick that Mary done it the correct way - hope i got the right name).

Ive been doing WW's since march and haven't really lost anything..so I'm hoping this will help..she says you will walk off a meal with that workout.  :O)

Lots of great high/low intervals with upper and lower body movement. The toning band exercises in the fourth mile are tough, but not overly so. She also had one of the other walkers do part of the third mile instruction - she was really good! A nice break from Leslie, who, while very motivating, can talk A LOT. For anyone who wants to stay motivated, all of Leslie's DVDs are great. I recommend them to all my friends who are either beginning or veteran exercisers.",1303603200,,599,4.405405405405405

Certified exercise leader Leslie Sansone's aerobic exercise DVDs are the best on the market.  They are reliable for weight loss, for diabetics using exercise to control blood glucose levels, and generally to maintain good health.  They are scientifically based and safe, low-impact, while giving you an effective workout.  The famous  cardiologist Dr. Kenneth Cooper who established and developed  the concept of  ""aerobic exercise"", I understand  chose Ms. Sansone to make aerobic exercise DVDs based on his medical research and philosophy.
I particularly like her Walk Slim, Fast & Firm! 4 Really Big Miles, with Ms. Sansone in a cream jogging jacket and white camisole, and part of the DVD and cover in lavender, with an attractive group of exercisers, doing excellent walk and jogging (boosted walking) intervals.  You can select any of the four miles, or any combination or them.  Some of her DVDs allow you to listen to the music only, deleting Leslie Sansone's instructions.  The Leslie Sansone DVDs use lively music selected to get one's heart rate up to ""aerobic exercise"" levels.  The ""beats per minute""  (BPM) are sufficiently rapid that you do break a sweat by the end of one mile or 15 minutes.
Anyone can fit 15 minutes  of exercise a day in  to be healthy.  The benefits of this 15 minutes a day?  Lose weight.  Lower your blood pressure.  Drop your post-meal blood glucose to safe levels from 20 to 40 mg/dl to save your sight, your kidney function and nervous system, defeat insulin resistance, increase insulin sensitivity and avoid becoming a diabetic.  Maintain and increase your brain capacity and functioning.  Produce your own human growth hormone.  Safe and cost-effective, aerobic exercise accomplishes all of this.
The wonder of her exercise DVDs is that you can get a medically sound aerobic exercise workout by just walking, jogging and stretching in a small space, in your home or office, without the need for expensive workout equipment, without the need for a large, open space.
AND:  the price is right.",1303603200,5,2057,5.059523809523809
3285604,5,B0010V60XY,"This is my favorite of all her walking videos. I personally like it better when she walks in a group. I don't mind that she talks with the other walkers...I think it is nice. Some people complain that when she walks alone it is better because she is more focused on when to cue you in.

I really could care less if I am on perfect beat or what not. I am happy that I am just moving and thats that! I find her encouraging as always and I really love the firm band. I can really feel it working my core!

3285618,5,B0010V60XY,"I own a bunch of Leslie's walking DVD's and this one, for me, is the best. I like the fact that she works you up with more intensity with each mile. Some of the others do this with each mile so you're up and down 4 or 5 times. Once I start- I don't want to amp down until the end which ,for me, is after 4 complete miles. I also like her stretch on this one.",1301616000,,358,3.6623376623376624

3285620,3,B0010V60XY,"I rented this from Netflix. I have a couple of Leslie's DVD's so I wanted to see what this was like before spending money on it. For a beginner or someone who has not worked out in a long time, this would probably be a nice challenge. However, in my regular exercise, I am used to sweating through my clothes. This DVD caused me to sweat very lightly. For this reason, I would say that if you are an avid, hardcore exerciser, this would be good only for a light day (or an off day).

As noted by other reviewers, the cuing is off and if it weren't for the fact that the exercisers are sweating, I'd think that they were yelling ""CUT!"" and tried to string the segments together because there are parts that seems to lack continuity. I also found it odd that Steve is a basketball coach and former player but could not execute the simple moves on this DVD with a high level of accuracy.

Mary Kay leads for a few minutes and at the end, they use a band. The last song, Leslie says she's going to be quiet because she wants the walkers to hear the words to the song...but she doesn't stop talking.

Overall, it serves its purpose. If you do choose to get it, don't buy it at full price.",1297296000,4,1183,4.1798245614035086

3285622,5,B0010V60XY,"I bought this video after purchasing a workout dvd that left me feeling incompetent and discouraged. I had heard about Leslie's workout videos, and had considered trying it for a long time. I LOVE this video. I've only had it for 3 days, but it's working wonders. I've lost 8 ounces, which isn't much to some, but it makes a difference to me. It's paced for anyone of any age, and you can add-to, or take away, some of the moves to modify it to your level. I really like that she is motivating and friendly, and that she really pushes you to finish not only this dvd, but any goal you want in life. I'm not a weight lifter, a gym enthusiast, or an aerobics expert, so this work-at-home-at-your-own-pace system was perfect for me. I don't have to feel intimidated by skinny women, or buff guys, who plague the gym/fitness centers. I can work out at home and feel totally comfortable in whatever I am wearing and however I am moving. I would highly recommend this workout dvd to ANYONE who is wanting to better their health and get in shape. I look forward to going home every evening and doing the 4 miles and yoga stretches.

I love the lack of talking at the beginning.  The video goes straight to the menu to let you choose your workout.  You can also choose your workout.  From the menu, you can choose which mile(s) you would like to complete.  You do get the same chitty-chatty Leslie, but that is part of her workouts.  Overall, a very good workout!

I would definitely recommend this DVD! It is #1 on my list.",1291939200,,392,3.8625

Excellent workout with the boosted walking segments and super strength training with the firm band.  On Weight Watchers for four months and had hit that plateau to where I couldn't move the scale much anymore...this is doing it!  The only thing that would make this DVD perfect would be if it had an option to turn off Leslie's constant chatter.  She talks way more in this one that the other two I have.  By this point we've got the steps, Leslie.  The music is great - it's ok to just lead the workout and leave me to my own thoughts!  Thanks - Lisa",1283126400,3,663,4.290322580645161

Boy, and can you tell the difference!  This is the first of the group I have tried having been exposed to it at an exercise class of St Theresa Catholic Church in Sunny Hills, Florida. As Leslie Sansone herself says ""Even the warm-up is a little peppy.""

I don't know if it is this particular DVD or one of the others I cited but at least one of them introduces the audience to ""boosted walking"" or mild or gentle jogging. Most of this indoor walking tape is done to a 3-4 MPH walking pace. In the second mile it speeds up to a 12 minute mile and in the third mile a 10 minute mile. As Leslie says ""You don't have to worry about following the steps. Just keep pace with the music."" This is so true and so stress relieving. Unlike some of the FIRM tapes where these very young, very skinny instructors force you to learn complex moves just to keep up with them, Leslie's instructions are simple but effective. I can FEEL myself start to sweat! She admits herself:  ""This is not about being perfect. This is about getting a good,healthy workout.""",1279843200,4,2439,7.371134020618556
3285644,5,B0010V60XY,I have many of Leslie's work out DVD's and I love them all.  The three mile ones were getting a bit too easy so I decided to try 4 miles.  This DVD is so fun that I hardly noticed that it was an extra mile.  I worked hard and felt great afterward but it went by very quickly!!  She introduces some new fun moves that made the workout unique from some of the others.  Can't wait to do it tomorrow!!,1275523200,,397,3.9125
3285645,3,B0010V60XY,I love Leslie Sanson Walking Videos.  This particular DVD does not do it for me.  I think it is the music..the very first song turns me off.  I need music that motivates me and makes me want continue to work out just because of the music.  There is only one song in the DVD that I like and it is at mile 4 and it is the last song before the cool down.  I tried using mute but then I get off cue because I don't know when she is going change the steps.  I still do the workout because it is a great workout but I suffer through the music.,1273449600,,537,3.7927927927927927

3285647,5,B0010V60XY,"This is my favorite of her exercise DVD's.  The first mile is 15 minutes & the warm up is a little faster because this is not for beginners; 2nd mile is 12 minutes; 3rd mile is 10 minutes, & the 4th mile is used with the stretchie band.  The 2nd & 3rd miles are fast because boosted walking/mild jogging are done.  I like this DVD so well because you can select from the main menu which mile you want to do.  I prefer doing 1 & 4 miles as I am over 50 & do not really need to jog.  If you prefer to folllow along from 1-3 mile & do not prefer jogging, you can always walk in place & your movements can become exagerated.  By this I mean, that you can do higher kicks & slower kicks than lots of little leg kicks.  She is mindful of limitations that the viewer has a gives helpful pointers throughout the DVD.  To me this is one of the safest exercise programs.  You do have to judge & do this DVD in the way that is right for you.  I notice that my waist tones up with use of this DVD.  You do have to eat sensibly if you are just trying to maintain your weight.  I do not burn up enough calories just doing 2 miles to be able to eat junk food.
I have been using these DVD's for years & was told by my cardiologist that I had actually had an improvement in my echocardiogram & that my cholesterol looked good.  A recent check on BP was excellent.  In fact, the nurse stated that she had never seen BP so good on an older person (I'm in my 50's.  Thank you so very much!)  I am convinced any of Leslie's Walking DVD's do much for the body & its maintenance.",1272412800,,1556,3.9391025641025643
3285648,5,B0010V60XY,"I really love this workout. Leslie is always encouraging and that keeps you pressing forward. The miles go by rather quickly because you aren't just doing simple walking. The variation in movements as you walk allows your 4 miles to fly by, but not without alot of sweat, which is wonderful. Also, the great thing about the program is that you can even go back and do a particular mile several times, so a 4-mile workout could easily turn into 5 or 6, or more. I'm so hooked that I'd love to make time to do this twice-a-day, but for now, I'm excited and quite impressed by the casual, but effective and fun nature of this workout.

It's easy to follow, but does make me sweat a lot. I can see my health condition improved a lot just by doing this for 1 week! I like the way that it divides 4-mile walk into 1-mile mini walks. If I don't have time, I'll just do 1-2 miles, I feel great! I like the part that she integrated strength training into the 4th mile. YES...TONING BAND is included! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that...I'm getting bored and annoyed with Leslie's voice and the music. You'll see what I'm talking about. LOL

3285650,5,B0010V60XY,"Since starting to work out with Walk Away the Pounds for Abs in January I have bought and gotten from the library a bunch of different WATP workouts. This one and the 5 mile fat burning walk are so far my favorites because they are brisk (4 kneelifts on Mile 1 already) from start to finish. I like the fast paced music in this one and although at first I wasn't a big fan of Mile 4 because of the stretchie band and the Mambo now I love them plus I noticed how they target muscles differently. I couldn't have done these longer fast paced walks in the beginning so they are definitely for the intermediate.

Her chatter doesn't bother me, sometimes I forget all about it in the high paced workout. Plus I really like her.
My muscles have been getting sore and I've started getting muscle definition and dropped about 14 pounds since I started without really dieting but watching what I eat, and if I'd be better about that I'd lose more. Sometimes I do more upper body exercises with the arms then they do in the DVD and found especially the Hallelujahs are targeting muscles in a way I don't often use them. Great workout, love it.

The intensity builds at a steady pace..you're not worn out by the 3rd mile, but you are definitely getting a good workout.  The time went by very quickly.  It didn't seem like I was doing it for nearly an hour. I have quite a collection of Leslie's DVD's, and I use ALL of them.

3285652,5,B0010V60XY,"I have used two separate 4mile dvds from Leslie before buying this one. I was curious to see what would be the difference between the stretchie and the band that goes around the stomach. The workout was nice it was fun when she allowed one of the walkers to take over for a while. The stretchie is only used in the last mile and you feel each movement. I enjoy these workouts because you get results safely quickly and permanently once you stick with it. She even has a little dance to keep the fun. My 3yr old son works out with me this is really good.

I think one of the main things with these dvds as Lelsie says you need to watch your calories not starve but watch. Eat in moderation a little of everything yes including junk, to prevent your body from unnecessary cravings. I also use different tapes on different days so you don't get tired of 1 routine.",1269993600,,861,4.282208588957055

It was at that moment I knew I had to do something. The following day, I began the program, started to watch my portions and that was it. I worked my way up one mile at a time, until I was finally able to do the entire four miles with no problem. Well, it is now Feb. of 2010 and I've lost 71LBS!!!! My whole life has changed. I've dropped so many inches and I have so much energy, I can't wait to go back to the doctor next month and show off my progress. I still have a ways to go, but thank you Leslie and I feel like you are an old friend now. I look forward to working out with you every week. I would definately advice anyone who is serious to GET THIS DVD. I have bought others, like the ""5 Mile Fat Burning Walk"", and this past Christmas I got the ""Ultimate Collection"" which I love as well, but I like to switch off every now and then to add variety.

This morning, my heart rate monitor measured that I burned 637 calories during this workout!  If you work it and you really make an effort, you will get a super cardio, sweaty workout.  If you do this DVD and hardly know you're working out, you're just going through the motions.  You'll still burn calories of course, but as with anything else, you have to give it your all to make it really effective.  There is a lot of chatter, which really doesn't bother me.  What does bother me a bit is during the 4th mile, there are a couple of ""pull down"" exercises with the band that work the back, where Leslie doesn't count and you end up doing more on one side than the other.

The intervals of jogging and kicking (which you do while jogging in place) are fantastic and really increase the intensity.

You feel better all day.  I love how the background people in the DVD make ""mistakes"" like getting off beat or kicking with the opposite leg,  and they didn't edit it out.  She says throughout the video to keep moving, and doing it exact isn't the point.  That is not to say that the DVD is done sloppily, because it isn't.

I've never purchased a Leslie Sansone DVD and since I work out with many different DVD's by other exercise gurus, I wanted to have a change.  The workout raises your heart rate and the DVD gets progressively more intense as the workout continues. I like the addition of the stretch band as well.  The music is great and the hour goes by very quickly.  Leslie explains the steps before hand so you know what you are doing and she is very encouraging.

There is a guy on the floor who is struggling to keep up with everyone else.  He is perspiring profusely at the end of the workout and he admits that it was quite an exercise routine.

But her commentary.  It is frantic, hyper and incessant.  She makes the most ridiculous comments (even calling the guy I mentioned above ""doll face""). I don't know what she is like on her other DVD's, but after awhile, you really have to tune her out.  She never stops talking.

If you can get beyond the commentary, you'll have a great workout.  Wish I could have given it five stars...but the commentary just put me over the edge.",1255478400,7,1130,4.432038834951456

3285679,5,B0010V60XY,"This DVD is a great way to get a good workout in fairly quickly and (if using hand weights) can provide both aerobic exercise and strength training.  This is an easy-to-follow walk-at-home DVD that has four basic moves:  kicking, side-step, knee-lift, and walking.  The workout consists of:
*a 15-minute mile
*a 12-minute mile
*a 10-minute mile
*a 15-minute mile working with the included fitness band
*a cool down

The miles are all marked so one can skip to the desired mile with ease.  I often will go right to the 12 and 10 minute miles (repeating some within a given workout) so I can get the right workout for me.  I also use hand weights while I do the exercises (not included but bought at a local sporting goods store) to make the workout a challenge.  Over time I continue to increase the weight of the hand weights.  If one is new to working out, the basic workout (without weights) is a good place to start; the weights allow one to enhance the workout as one progresses.",1248220800,2,983,4.5141242937853105

I did find the bantering started to irritate me after a while.  It almost hurt my ears so I had to try and tune them out and focus on the movement.  The music is pretty much the same music :(  I haven't heard New Attitude on any of her others but it probably is.  I like how each mile got faster and the added boosts which I have done on her other dvds.  I just really really enjoyed it after I was finished and will now add this once per week to my fitness program.

If anyone has Wii, you have got to buy the EA Sports ACTIVE!  And use it on the days that you need a break from Leslie (though I love her and think she's absolutely the BEST workout video to follow ever!!!!)  Wii Fit and Leslie got me off my butt and I've lost 49 pounds since Jan 11th.  Losing at a nice steady rate and can really see the muscle tone change in my arms and legs and thanks to Leslie I can actually RUN 2.4 miles on my treadmill at 5.0 to 6.0 speed.  Each week it increases a smidge.  But I AM RUNNING!!!!  Who knew :)

It's also nice to see them go straight through the 4 miles and ACTUALLY SWEAT!  In her other dvds I never would see her glow at all and in this one they're all dripping!

Only buy this if you've done her others.  You can't really start with this one unless you're already pretty fit and know her moves.",1243036800,3,1484,3.956081081081081

I really felt like I got an effective work out with this program. Leslie calls it ""walking"" but there are kicks and jogging and even some toning included in the 4th mile.

I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12.

3285740,3,B0010V60XY,"I have been alternating this dvd with the 4 mile express super challenge 3-5 times a week since mid october of '08. it is a great workout, but i like the super challenge better. leslie just seems more calm and encouraging on that one.

i hate to be negative because she's all about being positive, but her banter in this dvd is on the verge of being spastic with a tinge of hysteria. i don't know. she just keeps talking and talking and talking. and it's not as much helpful info as just grating. ""lyn, did us agitate you?"" ""you're generating body heat on my sisters"" ""you should wear it (the stretchie band) as a belt"" ""keep moving dollface"" ""i can't help thinking there goes someone's china cabinet"" these and other comments said in various degrees of baby talk and high pitched squeaks makes the video feel manic. it's hard to concentrate on what is really an effective physical workout. call it being peppy if you will, i call it overdone and annoying.

this video is also hard to watch. it looks like the high school a/v club tried to shoot it. there's quite a few blurry, extreme closeups of the walkers' faces as they try to smile while dripping sweat, and crazy random shots of people's waists. also there are at least two times where the moves change but you can't see it because the camera is trained on someone's feet or hips. also, everyone has trouble keeping in step, especially some of the newbies and the poor guy in the back. (seriously, did they have to give him a pink stretchie?) but of course, staying in step is not so important as just moving, as the WATP mantra goes.

there's a few long pauses between music which really seem amateur considering how many videos this company has made. which is too bad, because i like the music. it's just hard to get into it because the woman won't be quiet!

i don't want to give up on the WATP program, because i have been seeing results from doing these workouts. i've ordered the 5 mile dvd to see if maybe that can take the place of this dvd. i may have to just sit down one day and make my own cd of music to play so i can just mute the dvd and follow the workout...

and it is a good strong workout, a good balance between arms and legs. i don't do the skips during the boosted walking; i just jog in place through it all. the stretchie band makes it interesting. even though it's as long as the 4 mile super challenge, it feels as if it goes by faster.

so, if you can stand the incessant dialogue, you can get a good advanced workout.",1232409600,40,2502,4.312765957446809

I've never been crazy about heavily choreographed workout dvds so this one is perfect.  I did it once or twice with the sound on, and now I just put it on mute and play my own music while I walk along with it.  The moves are easy to pick up and easy to follow.  It works for all age groups and all ability levels. I'd really recommend it.
Also, I really like the instructor.  Ms. Sansone seems very nice and positive.  I'm not big on ""tough love"" and some popular instructors turn me off with their aggressive ways.  I know that works for some people, but I hate feeling like I'm being bullied by a dvd.  Ms. Sansone is very polite and perky (she may be a bit too perky for some), so she's an instructor I don't mind seeing everyday.

I love the boosted walking (jogging) - I don't do the kicks, just keep jogging back and forth for that session.  I also love the additional moves - lots of tap outs, the grapevine, and such.  I'm not sure why kickbacks aren't included in what she calls her basic moves, since they do them in almost every DVD.  Some cons:  her cuing isn't her best, and some of the arm motions don't work with the leg movements.  She has Mary Kay lead for about 5 minutes on the second mile -- I really would have preferred Leslie do it all.  Leslie continually talks, even when she says she's going to be quiet, she never stops.  The background is all black except for 5 panels in back and the stage.  And since everyone is in black pants (which I hate since it obscures leg movements), when the camera angle has the black background, all you see is the head and arms (and maybe the top) moving!  The camera guys and editors did an amateurish job with the shots and editing -- you'll be looking a feet or a torso as movements change and you haven't a clue what is going on.

Like many of her other longer workouts, you can do as many miles as you please, and her banter with her other walkers is fun to watch.  But the real reason I love this workout is because every mile is different.  The first mile is traditional, the second mile is a power mile that's faster, and then comes my favorite--the boosted mile where you do jogging intervals.  The fourth mile uses her stretchie band; while it's good, I would much rather use weights than the band, and don't feel like that mile is all that challenging for me.  However, it's still good, and I love the variety.  All the moves are simple, easy to follow, and it really gets your heart rate up during those middle miles.

She has a ""boosted walking"" segment, she leads into that is a nice comfortable jog with little leg kicks.

That gives me something to shoot for, I guess.  I love the jogging in place; I was a runner when I was in my 30s and *nothing* is better for staying slim while eating pretty much whatever I want.  However, make sure you are wearing a supportive bra if your front upper torso is ample like mine.  I love Leslie but sometimes I do wish she would stop talking.",1224720000,4,907,3.977777777777778

3285786,5,B0010V60XY,"I have been using Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles"" for a month or so now and I love it!  I've used three other programs of Leslie's and enjoyed them too but this one is so much more intense. It makes me work hard but I am feeling stronger and more fit every day and I can see the difference in how my arms and legs look already.  Love the resistance band!  Some people have complained about Leslie's banter but I like it--she has a way of reminding me of what I should be doing, i.e. ""tuck your tummy"" just at the time when I've started to get sloppy.  She keeps it fun and I don't get bored.",1222732800,4,622,4.032520325203252
3285787,5,B0010V60XY,"I have done various Leslie Sansonne dvd's since 2000.  I have to say I find this one of her best yet.  4 miles sounds like a lot but the workout is at a fast pace with a good variety of movements.  One of Leslie's strength's is that she keeps the pace fast and varied so you do not get bored. The first mile is about 15 minutes, followed by mile two in about 12 minutes and mile three in 10 minutes.  The fourth mile uses a stretch exercise band and takes about 15 minutes. I have been doing this workout daily and then repeat 2 extra miles making a total of 6 miles daily.  I have been doing the workout for five days and have dropped 7lbs.  So if you are looking for a way to get fit and lose weight this workout delivers!",1222732800,7,724,3.9930555555555554

Love the boosted walking (jogging) and am ready for more of that.

The music could be better I get a little tired of ""everybody""

The stetchy band section is great and I would like to have seen the whole of the last mile with that.

As with any exercise, you get out of it what you put into it.",1222646400,,521,4.029126213592233

This dvd is simply the best!!!  Great workout and so much fun!  Leslie uses her basic moves with some changes but I like the fact that she does because I know what to expect.  I usually add my own ""style"" to her basic moves which makes exercising with her all the more fun!!",1222560000,2,519,3.858490566037736

I like the way it starts out at a good pace. I like the way I can skip around the DVD, depending on how much time I have and how I feel, moving from the one mile, skipping the two mile, if I so choose, going to the three or four mile or moving right into the cool down. If you are a person who likes Leslie Sansone and know how she works and know her stuff, you will like this workout. I highly recommend it.",1220918400,2,564,3.7478991596638656

It is a very good workout.  It ranks up there with the Walk Away the Pounds 4 Mile Super Challenge.,1220832000,3,266,3.8

3285798,2,B0010V60XY,"My daughter got me started on walking away the pounds and it is an effective form of exercise. I started with the 1, 2 then 3 mile versions. and found them very enjoyable. Then I purchased the 4 mile video. Yikes ....This IS a good workout but I can't watch it, I just listen. Everyone, including Leslie, is out of step and out of time, both physically and verbally. It drives me nuts to watch. This problem begins in the opening scenes when Leslie starts out of step from everyone else and the problem continues in one form or another all the way through the video, with everyone in the group moving out of step at various times throughout the workout. Watching the group and trying to stay in step with them is a waste of time. Even verbal commands and counts are out of time with what is actually going on! Now I just listen and that gives me a good workout.  This video should be remade and people with proof of purchase should be offered a replacement video or refund if desired.",1220745600,19,984,4.3478260869565215
3285799,5,B0010V60XY,"Leslie Sansone always has good workout tapes. This one is no exception. The fast pace is great and I no longer have any excuse for not exercising because it goes by so quickly. The first mile is the regular 15 minutes, then the 2nd mile is 12 min. and the 3rd is even faster because of the jogging intervals. Then the last mile is strength training. I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who enjoys walking indoors or outside!",1220486400,3,427,4.417721518987341

I just could not imagine why anyone would buy a ""walking"" workout, but finally ordered it after several people told me how great it was. They were right. I absolutely love it. You can choose to do 1,2,3 or 4 miles. I have only had it for about a month, but I can tell a huge difference in the way my clothes fit since I started. It is also low impact which is great for those that cannot deal with all of the jumping around. Try it!!",1220227200,2,500,4.0606060606060606

I must admit I haven't been able to make it to 4 miles yet.  The music has improved.  It's a great work out for those that want to work out at home and you can make it as easy or as difficult as you are capable of doing.  There is no excuse for not walking - and with Leslie you sure can.,1219881600,,440,3.5520833333333335
3285814,5,B0010V60XY,"This workout is alot of fun and definately a good workout.  I have several of Leslies dvd's and was looking for one that was more challenging than what I had.  This is it.  She includes the usual walk steps from her other dvds, but also adds things like ""grapevines"", ""boosted walking""(light jog), and even a mambo move.  Also mile 4 uses the firm band, which was included with my dvd from Amazon.  A great workout!",1218931200,3,415,4.48

When I watched the sample trailer it shows Leslie by herself and doing other exercise routine such as the squat with the stretchy.  I was really looking forward to the workout.

That's the reason for the 2 star score.  I feel dupped into buying a workout dvd, opening the package and once it's opened you can't return it.  Oh well, I've decided to give it away.",1218153600,29,500,4.636363636363637

3285821,4,B0010V60XY,I have at least 25 of Leslie Sansone's Video and DVD. I many of the older out print like walk away the stress the 1 mile for abs etc. I wish she would put those on DVD. This one is one of her best. Yes she talks no stop for almost an hour. She uses her basic 4 steps but it goes by fast. I like the music she uses for her 4 the mile. I wish she would use it more often. I am thankful for Leslie because she gets those of us up and out of the chair. It has been because of Leslie that I have been able to at the Firm into my routine. And I am using the older firm tapes/dvds and they are long.... but thanks to leslie I am keeping up.

I have a bad back so I have to just walk on occassion, some days I can do the whole thing, it depends on the day,  and she is very forgiving and lets you know that, she isn't as structured or phony like most fitness ""guru's"". This is my 4th tape, plus I go to exercise on demand and do those as well. I love them all. Again, anyone that is that ""real"" and cares that much is ok with me, and I am staying fit. At 60 it is getting a little more difficult. She does an excellent job, I give this one, which is a good mixture of work outs. 5 stars. Love it and love her.",1215302400,6,724,3.763157894736842

3285827,5,B0010V60XY,"I have quite a few of Leslie's DVD workouts, and this is one of my favorites. I like that it is quick (4 miles in about 50 minutes) and low impact. Even the boosted sections, where you're running or doing one of the other modified steps, are not hard on joints or muscles.

I love the interaction between Leslie and the other walkers, many have been in her other DVDs. It is like walking with old friends.

This DVD, and the others in Leslie's series, have gotten me through several winters, helping me stay in shape without having to find time and energy to head to the gym.",1212364800,12,575,4.314814814814815

I now own 7 in total.  This one of the better ones and gives a great workout, but is not equipped with ""music only"" mode, which will be required by those who find Leslie's constant conversation a bit much if you use these DVD's every day like I do.

I've used her workouts since Jan 2008 and have gained stamina, endurance and weight-loss.  I'm selective, though, opting for her fast, long workouts that have her classic and some really good other moves.  They've helped me a lot to get and stay healthy.  Her workouts with using weights while moving may not be a good option for those who have knee problems like I do. Too much load on the knees.  Otherwise, these workouts are my favorites. Her talking doesn't bother me so much, until she starts getting people more involved in talking like she's done in her latest video.  In any case, I stick with her workouts.",1520294400,,893,4.55
8238626,4,B0010V60XY,"This is one of Leslie's older walks, and the production reflects that.  The cast is a bit older than the walkers appearing in her more recent workouts, and the set is dark and drab.  The music is somewhat dated too (it includes the ubiquitous ""Everybody"" song that appeared in many of Leslie's videos from this time period).  There are odd, random close-ups of some of the walkers' feet and waists.  However, this is still a really good workout.  The pace is quicker than some of her others, and the length of the workout is almost a solid hour (the stretch segment is a separate chapter). The 4th mile allows for some decent upper body toning with the resistance band. Leslie claims you can walk off a meal with this workout.
