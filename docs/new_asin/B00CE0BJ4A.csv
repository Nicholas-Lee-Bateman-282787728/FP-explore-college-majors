If you like Josh Groban, Michael Buble etc. then you are going to love Chris's voice & music also.
ps. ~ he's even better live (if that's possible) so make sure you go see him if you can.",1367107200,10,312,3.890625
5717243,5,B00CE0BJ4A,"Chris Mann, who is best known as a finalist on The Voice, performs in his first PBS concert special.  I love his mix of old & new songs- all with that ""Chris Mann sound""- strong & powerful. The duet with Martina McBride is beautiful.  ""Hallelujah"" had me in tears. The very talented Mindi Abair fits perfectly.  I could go on forever...

I highly recommend this DVD & also try to catch Chris Mann in person as he tours the United States in 2013.",1366761600,8,445,4.325301204819277

5717248,1,B00CE0BJ4A,"I loved this show on PBS!  It's great.

However, I got 3 bad DVD's - the left side audio was horrible.  I played it on both of my DVD players and computers all with the same result.  I tested other DVD's right after as well - they worked just fine.  Amazon apparently got a bad batch.  I will reorder when I know that they have fixed the problem.",1375660800,,346,4.014705882352941
5717249,5,B00CE0BJ4A,"Chris Mann is the most talented singer I've heard in years.  I first saw him on the PBS show ""A Man For All Seasons"" &  I was in awe.  I would recommend this to everyone young & old.  Can't wait to see him again on PBS.  Hopefully soon.",1374537600,2,236,3.8333333333333335
5717250,5,B00CE0BJ4A,He has a beautiful voice and will have a long career. He also sings songs with a passion that has escaped Josh Groban .,1373328000,,119,4.0
5717251,5,B00CE0BJ4A,"Chris Mann new singer on the scene new CD and DVD recently seen on PBS is great.  He sings with his heart and soul, and I believe, will be a top singer in the market in the future.  Highly suggest you check him out.",1373241600,,215,3.8636363636363638

8580705,5,B00CE0BJ4A,I really love watching the concert. Chris Mann is a fantastic singer. He has his own style and rendition. Even  Cathy Lee Gifford said. : He was flawless. I was so glad I have the dvd and many of his ads. I wish him the best. The music industry needs more singer's like him.,1510185600,,274,4.074074074074074
8580706,5,B00CE0BJ4A,"I purchased (download) this DVD from i-tune I believe it was for $12.99.  I learned about him by accident when I was searching for a song and he was one of the singers for this song listed in the internet.  I listened to several of his songs in the internet and I was hooked!  It is an excellent DVD.  His voice is simply amazing.  His rendition of the ""Power of Love"", in my humble opinion, is better than C.  Dionne's.",1493510400,,420,4.1875
8580707,5,B00CE0BJ4A,"Only disappointment was the decision by the recording engineers to put all the music on the left and Chris's voice on the right.  A bit discerning but listen on regular TV and back away and it is not too bad.  An excellent concert by a real up and coming new crooner.  He is a mix of Sinatra, Andy Williams and the smile to go with.  Beautiful voice.  Try to match him up with Katharine McPhee on YouTube for a duet presentation of 'The Prayer'. Simply beautiful.  This is a great concert - worth ordering and owning",1427587200,,516,4.322916666666667
8580708,5,B00CE0BJ4A,"If you yearn for a vocalist with passion for their craft, your search ends here! Chris Mann (known from Season 2 on The Voice) delivers stunning vocals on every song, nuanced with emotions that can only come from deep within. Crystal clear and unadulterated by autotune, Chris will move your feet and touch your heart with his renderings in this DVD. Superior performance from a Mann with a very bright future!",1427068800,,410,4.788732394366197
8580709,4,B00CE0BJ4A,"Chris Mann is a great Singer. The Concert is a little too short, but you can hear his best songs. His live interpretations differ only in little details from his recordings. The stereo panorama of this dvd is irritating: hear chris on one side and the band on the other side. This is perfect for me: I use the ""band"" as a playback for my singing.",1423008000,,346,4.257575757575758
8580710,5,B00CE0BJ4A,I'd recommend this DVD.  Entertaining and enjoyable!,1413417600,,52,6.428571428571429
