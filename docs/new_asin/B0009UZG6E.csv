It's Elvis. . . .that should say it all!! Great!",1272326400,,85,4.0588235294117645
2322259,5,B0009UZG6E,"Spinout is old school Elvis silly funny movie. Double trouble is a little goofy but still Elvis. My kids like it. If you are looking for Academy Award winning performances and story lines, you are in the wrong place. Very entertaining but not too deep. I love it.",1271376000,5,263,4.5
2322260,1,B0009UZG6E,"This man is reported to have loved his mother, and after I saw him on The Ed Sullivan Show, I looked further.  In the five-whole minutes I spent on ""research,"" I could find no ""redeeming social value"" for ""Elvis,"" and a lifetime later, I still have no idea what all the fuss was about.  I'm unsure who put the films ""Spin Out/Double Trouble"" on the page for me to review but if it was a computer, unplug it!  Stand s/he who tapped its keys face into a corner for fifteen minutes of ""time out,"" and then mail me a copy of an essay, ""Why I Offended Neil and How I'll Keep From Ever Doing It Again.""  Be ashamed!",1266624000,,609,4.135593220338983
2322261,5,B0009UZG6E,"Shelley Fabares as Cynthia Foxhugh great!
 Annette Day ...  Jill Conway in Double Trouble was great This movie been looking for for a long time. Service was great",1260230400,3,162,4.75
2322262,4,B0009UZG6E,"It's nice to re-release these 2 films, at a very good price, considering they are $9.99 each at the moment. However it would be better if they released movies that are not yet released... ""Kissin' Cousins"", ""Girl Happy"", ""This is Elvis"", to name a few... Just the same old repackaging job again. Mind you, this has been the story of Elvis' career (while alive and especially now): re-release, re-package, again and again. There is still quite a bit of stuff not on DVD yet (I forgot to mention ""Elvis on Tour' and ""Elvis in Concert""), so why not them instead?",1118102400,6,559,4.6

2322384,4,B0009UZG6E,"Released in 2005, this double-sided DVD features the Elvis Presley films Spinout (1966), and Double Trouble (1967).  Both were directed by Norman Taurog, and are presented in widescreen with subtitles.  For casual fans of The King, this flipper disc is an economical way to own both films, which are also available separately in remastered versions reissued in 2007.

Spinout is a light fun romp featuring Elvis as Mike McCoy, the leader of a band, pursued by a trio of beautiful girls.  McCoy also races cars, and he and the band travel between gigs in a Duisenberg, with a Cobra racing car in tow.  The band's female drummer Les (Deborah Walley), has a secret crush on Mike.  And author Diana St. Clair (Diane McBain), also has her sights on him.

Millionaire businessman Howard Foxhugh (Carl Betz), uses his influence to get the group to perform for his daughter's birthday.  Cynthia (Shelley Fabares) is a spoiled angel-faced girl, who also falls for Mike.  After declining Foxhugh's offer to drive his new race car, and with three women after him, everything comes down to a colorful and exciting race.

The musical numbers are a highlight.  ""Stop Look and Listen"" kickstarts the movie.  ""Never Say Yes"", ""Adam And Evil"", and ""Beach Shack"" are fun tunes.  While the title song ""Spinout"", is performed at a party among an ocean of girls.

Shelley Fabares looks very cool and dreamy, while Deborah Walley is made to look like a boy, as she very convincingly plays the drums.  Spinout is the kind of light fluff that should please most Presley fans, as the enthusiastic musical performances help to boost what is an average story to a 3.5 star rating.

In Double Trouble, Presley is Guy Lambert, a singer performing in England.  Unknown to Guy, Jill Conway (Annette Day) a girl he is involved with, is just seventeen.  Fortunately, no illegal acts with the minor occur.  Only after having a talk with Jill's uncle Gerald Waverly (John Williams), does Guy discover the truth.

Jill boards Guy's ship bound for Belgium.  During the voyage, smugglers slip some jewels in the singer's luggage.  Upon reaching port, Guy and his band begin their tour.  Jill predictably appears during a performance in a club, and with few options, Guy agrees to take her to Sweden, as the buffoonish smugglers trail along.

Things take a dark turn in Antwerp, when an attempt is made on Jill's life.  Elvis breaks out his karate moves to defend her, and the attempted assassin ends up breaking his neck.  Guy is taken into police custody and questioned, as Waverly arrives on the scene.  The film's big finale features Guy's escape from the police station, and a lackluster chase through the town.

Elvis met his future wife Priscilla Wagner in 1959 when she was only 14, and eventually married her in 1967, only about a month after the release of Double Trouble.  As Presley had himself been romantically involved with a minor, his decision to participate in a film that so closely resembles his real life situation, is quite curious.

This remains Annette Day's only film, and as an unknown, she doesn't have the qualities you normally associate with one of Elvis's leading ladies.  Yvonne Romain is the only other female with any major screen time.  With a weak story, and lackluster music, Double Trouble is mostly for die hard Elvis fans, rating 2 stars.

Overall, this disc scores points mostly as a value buy, with one pretty good movie, and a second that strangely hits a little too close to reality.",1318377600,,3488,4.827993254637437
2322385,5,B0009UZG6E,"Elvis' movies may seem like mindless entertainment to many, but I've always loved them since I saw them in the theater.  I heard that Elvis hated most of his movies, but his fans flocked to the theater in droves.  Most are the same story told in slightly different ways, but they are all enjoyable.  I now have the pleasure of sharing these with my 5 and 9 year old granddaughters.  The price is right and the movies are good clean fun.  Not a bad combination in these troubled times.",1314921600,5,484,4.393258426966292
