Content: about 5 min of intereting but unnecessary historc comentary of Japanese influence in Europe, 20 min basics, 15 min of kata; ""Suuji No Kun"" (Shushi No Kun) claiming ot have originated in Yamani ryu though not sure if meant the short Shushi No Kun or ALL Shushi No Kun Kata origines, ""Choun No Kun Sho & Dai"" (created by the aurhot's teacher, they are NOT the classic Choun No Kun nor even resembling Choun No Kun with the kneeling jab, leap back & out and turning long sweep of sand-flicking, but rather with similarities to Isshin-ryu's three bo kata and a few other, useing multiple horizontal & vertical striks), and Ryubi No Kun (with elements of Sakugawa No Kun katas and again perhaps similar influences to Isshin-ryu's bo katas, though maybe jsut common contemporary influences of both styles at the time of their kata creations), then ending with 7 min of Kumibo and a geneology chart glimpse.  Yamani Chnin Ryu seems to be a branch of Shorin-ry but it was never actually said, nor sure if these are it's only 4 bo kata, as I had thought there was a ""Chinin No Kun"" kata existing.  The kata shown are clear and shown from different angles.  The only thing being the historic portion, unrelated to the style, that probably should have been instead, a specific history & background of Yamani Chinin Ryu it's self.  If there are other bo kata, I hope a volume 2 will someday be done to cover the rest, as well as the specific history & perhaps even describign the influences leading to it's differences of other Shorin-ryus or at least that it is indeed a branch of Shorin-ryu or an independant weapons branch onto it's self?",1008288000,5,1697,4.681208053691275
