7508231,5,B017NESD36,Everything from this company is gold. It is the perfect level of stimulation for kids and we are truly shocked by our younger children who learn things from it (1.5 years). We got this for our 4 year old to help get her ready for Kindergarten and she is quickly learning to recognize how numbers interact.,1470441600,2,305,4.464285714285714

8739892,2,B017NESD36,"Video presentation in the beginning are good because they repeat the equation 4 times so children will remember. But halfway, they only repeat once and on a faster mode.  So it's like you only pay for half..as children will not learn or will learn harder on a super fast approach on the 2nd half of the video.",1506470400,,309,4.421052631578948

8739897,5,B017NESD36,"2yo and 4yo love these vidoes (they have levels 1-3) and insist on watching them every day at least twice a day one right after the other.

Our youngins did NOT enjoy the rock-and-learn version of learning (none of them). The audio on Math Facts is catchy and animation is cute. Gives little ones something to enjoy while learning. On the rock-and-learn version, the music is so bad that no one in our house will allow the dvd's to play more than 5m and they are going off.",1474588800,2,473,4.375
