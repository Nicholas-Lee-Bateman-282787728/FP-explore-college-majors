8136364,5,B000H5TUOA,"Homespun has some of the best instructional videos out on the market today.  This bluegrass DVD has excerpts from some of their other tapes from some of the great players, including Norman Blake, Don Crary, Tony Rice and Steve Kaufman.  Happy Traum begins with an instruction on Wildwood Flower.  You are give ""Fair Warning"" from Happy Traum that this is an advanced tape, but if you have learned these tunes already, in a simplified form, you can add the ""ornaments"" you hear from the masters and ""step your game"" one level higher.  Norman Blake was my favorite and it whet my appetite to get one of his videos.",1344211200,,612,4.638888888888889
