I found in trying to learn about the film so be mindful it is biased; however with Amazon giving no review whatsoever, I figured I might as well share what info. I found.  Forget my star rating I chose neutral because I had to choose something. I have yet to see the film.
Taken from Facets: Set between the 1950s and late '70s against the beauty of the Tuscany seaside, Fish Soup offers small sketches of family behavior and psychology, from gatherings to complicated relationships. Narrating with a rare balance of frankness, naturalness and tenderness, Infascelli reveals a Chekhovian understanding of family relationships as we follow the development of Isabella (Chiara Caselli) and her relationship with her father (Philippe Noiret) and family. With Macha Meril, Andrea Prodan, Renzo Montagnani and Fausto Fiorentini. ""A family-size Amarcord set of recollections"" (L'Avvenire). Italian with English subtitles.
