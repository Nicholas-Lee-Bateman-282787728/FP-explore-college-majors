6682183,3,B00NW6KSN8,"Dog & Scissors looks like it could be interesting right? Nope! Here is the story. So a guy dies protecting his favorite writer and then upon his death has his consciousness move into a dog that is then looked after by the previously mentioned author. That's the whole damn show! A writer looking after a dog. BUT WAIT here is the interesting bit...the writer can read the dogs mind and so knows every thing he thinks. Interesting right? Not so much actually. Dog & Scissor try's to be funny and entertaining but the jokes mostly miss and there really isn't any plot to speak off. It's not a bad show....per say, buy at $40 you should watch this show else where to know if this anime is for you.",1428537600,,694,4.387596899224806
6682184,5,B00NW6KSN8,"This is a delightfully odd bit of anime. I don't think I've given any anime a five star rating for a while but this series had me binge watching and chuckling all the way through. Other reviews have said that this is very silly; it is, very, very silly. It relies on the concept of a young book-obsessed man being murdered in a cafe and being re-incarnated as a dog. A dog who can communicate telepathically with his favourite author and her editor. The dog is one star of the show whilst his owner is the other. Both are wonderfully scripted.
The first two episodes have themes of vengeance and a moral message/dilemma. After these tow episodes any attempt at a serious plot is gloriously ignored. There are themes of S&M, female domination, and animal abuse which makes this unsuitable for children (I wouldn't want to explain some of this to a 14 year old, would you?). If you can cope with this and see the funny and touching side this works. It worked for me but clearly I'd say this is going to appeal to a more mature audience.
The English dubbing is fine but  the notes do pass very quickly and you'll need to be quick with a pause button to read them all.
This is one of the most whimsical and amusing animes I've seen in a long time and I highly recommend it but caution others to watch out for the adult themes.",1427760000,6,1322,4.352226720647773
6682185,2,B00NW6KSN8,"To sum up this series: Guy turns into a dog, than nothing interesting happens for the next 11 episodes.
The series tries to be funny and fails most of the time.  The plot is mostly random events that make reference to the series made up books and celebrities.  This is a perfect example of how books can be made into great movies and shows but movies and shows about books are always lacking remember ""Ink Heart""... Yeah no one does.",1426464000,7,433,4.4
6682186,4,B00NW6KSN8,"Love the story and was happy to get it. I wrote a really mean post when I got this and it didn't work on my region free blu ray player, and I would like to apologize for that. It seems that my player was simply out of date and the sad thing is they don't update the one I have anymore. Sorry for any problems I might have caused.",1425254400,2,329,3.782608695652174
6682187,5,B00NW6KSN8,Okay so this is a really funny and kind anime.  the characters are quirky aand have good hearts. It isn't gonna blow your mind with originality but it is very entertaining. No special features sentai apparently does know they exist,1424476800,,231,4.775
6682188,4,B00NW6KSN8,"Arrived on time, good anime. The only issue I had was when it arrived I heard that there was a disc that came loose and was rattling around in the DVD case. So I had to unwrap it and push the disc back in it's holder. I was meant to be a gift so I was kind of upset that I had to open the original plastic wrapping. Luckily, though, the disc that came loose was okay, no scratches were made and it played perfectly fine.",1424131200,,420,3.895348837209302
6682189,4,B00NW6KSN8,Great show if you want to turn off your brain and just laugh with the ridiculousness of this show. Though better in Japanese I enjoyed the the English dub and all the antics that came from it.,1422489600,,192,4.216216216216216
6682190,4,B00NW6KSN8,"This show is so stupid and I loved every second of it. Its not an instant classic, but for what it is it was really enjoyable. Like many shows, this is not for everyone so look into it yourself to see if its something you may be interested in.",1422057600,,243,3.979591836734694
6682191,5,B00NW6KSN8,"It depends on your sense of humor, but I thought the show was funny and silly.  It is aimed more towards adults with the humor, so I would sugest it be for adults only ( no nudity is shown) who enjoy anime on the silly side.  I would buy again.",1421971200,,244,3.86
8680647,5,B00NW6KSN8,"Bought completely blind, and totally worth it. Funny, sadistic, and it has a dachshund. Plenty of  humor, and a smooth transition/evolution of the protagonists relationship",1523145600,,172,5.88
