Was not disappointed!!!

The film starts off at a circus and leads us to a magic show where the magician makes his daughter disappear.

Fairly typical trick-but there's a hitch.

The young lady doent re-appear!

Seems the forces of the universe have taken the magician to task and now he must go into another dimension to get her back.

This is a totally unique theme!

Never have I seen such an original story!

The special effects are laughable but add to the honest effort the film makers are putting forward.

This is a Filipino made film and like I said,it's very unique!

The second feature,Counter Destroyer is part of the `Robovampire'family of films.

Great cheese!

It's really a perfect double bill!

You will absolutely enjoy these films!

Look at my other reviews for weird horror!

Keep an eye out for the Tales Of Voodoo 10 film set!",1153785600,3,943,4.596385542168675

These are identified as widescreen and I've never seen widescreen before where the bar was totally on the bottom, but oh well. The quality of the transfer is about the same as the 50 movies for 19.99 collections which when you're paying less that 50 cents a movie is okay, but not at 6 bucks per film. The movies are awful, the dubbing is unbelievable. This is going into the stack to take to the local store that buys used DVDs. I assume that the others in the collection are equally bad. These aren't even worth renting.",1152748800,2,593,4.256637168141593
