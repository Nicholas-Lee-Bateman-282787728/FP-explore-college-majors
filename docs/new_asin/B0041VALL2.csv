4246686,5,B0041VALL2,"This was a very enjoyable and refreshing film. Good story, and good acting. If you ever had the good fortune to have an individual be an inspiration, mentor/role model during hard times in one's life, this film captures that soulful essence beautifully. I found it skillful how Joe Strummer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Shay Baker (Daniel Huttlestone) chanced upon one another throughout the film. Their interactions were genuinely heart-felt, and depicts Strummer as an overall decent human being. What is unique, the story unfolds through the lens of a fifteen year old, and we get to see it through his eyes. There is a down-to-earth quality in the film regarding regular people facing hard-times during lots of social change and upheaval in this film--amidst the backdrop of the punk rock movement.  I found Rhys Meyers portrayal of Strummer to be sincere and just right. Nothing in this film is over the top. It's fine story telling in the form of a coming-of-age-tale.",1475884800,,972,5.0
4246687,5,B0041VALL2,"Great little movie about London in the late 1970's.  Among the political, social, and economic turmoils, there are intensely personal ones affecting Shay and Alice.  Shay becomes head of the household after his parents become unfit and feels responsible for the almost bankrupt family business.  It is at this low point in his life that Shay meets Joe Strummer, lead singer of The Clash, and Shay's life begins to turn.  Daniel Huttleston gives a heartfelt performance as Shay and Anya McKenna-Bruce adds sparkle as Alice.  But Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Joe Strummer is the soul of the movie, the revolutionary who wants to bring peace to the world through music.  Meyers' Strummer is outspoken, jumpy, talented, and ultimately a good guy. And, as Shay finds out, his smile and music light up many hearts,",1475884800,4,803,4.955223880597015

4246689,5,B0041VALL2,"It's a great movie about being young and that first band and love that influences your life. Jonathan Rhys Meyers rocks it as Joe Strummer not only singing himself, but in the his accent and attitude. I am a huge Clash Fan and he does a phenomenal job. I would recommend it to anyone.  Esp if you grew up loving The Clash or had that special band and love that changed your life as a teenager.",1475798400,2,393,4.171052631578948
4246690,1,B0041VALL2,"There are ""Bad Movies We Love"" and then there are movies so bad one wonders if the makers had ever even SEEN a film before. Wouldn't you think that there'd be something to admire in a Technicolor musical featuring, among others, Kay Kendall, Tessie O'Shea and a very young Petula Clark, as well as dance choreographed by the legendary Agnes deMille? I have to admit that I bailed after one hour of sheer torture, which did include the deMille dance. I haven't checked yet, but I doubt that she featured it prominently in her list of Most Memorable Works. The story, such as it is, involves the supremely unappealing Sid Field trying to get a break in a London show. I sat slack-jawed at the one number he performed before I clicked it off. Perhaps it morphed into something brilliant in its second hour. I doubt it, though. Buy and watch at your own peril.",1441497600,2,856,4.529032258064516
4246701,4,B0041VALL2,"Forty years after punk rock exploded on the UK scene, many listeners have lost the visceral sources of its creation. Its surface style rejected the excesses of mainstream rock, but deeper anti-establishment and nihilistic currents were rooted in societal ills that dwarfed the bombast of popular entertainment. The clothing and hairstyles provided tribal badges, but it was the economic brutality of a mid-70s recession, crippling unemployment and the specter of Thatcherism that bound the scene together in hopelessness, anger and idealism. Its in this milieu that Derrick Bortes film is set, with music, politics and social upheaval providing the backdrop to a coming-of-age story.

While the Ramones and Sex Pistols lit the fuses of a thousand bands, the wider punk rock scene lit the fuses of a million personal awakenings. One such fuse is attached to the films teenage protagonist, Shay, whos estranged mother, overworked father and young sister require him to quickly outgrow his childhood. A cassette of the Clash and a serendipitous meeting with 15-year-old punk rocker Vivian open Shays eyes to a world beyond his working class suburb, a wide open and often contradictory world of skinheads and progressives, police riots and squats, love and preternatural maturity. All of that might be enough to permanently bend a teenagers trajectory, but a chance encounter with Joe Strummer, and the unlikely friendship they form, proves an even bigger catalyst.

The films music scenes - a club date, a rehearsal and a concert - will remind you why the Clash was called the only band that matters. More importantly, theyll will remind you that the right music at the right time can utterly liberate and completely transform a life. The soundtrack features music by the Clash, Stranglers, Buzzcocks, 101ers, Stiff Little Fingers and Toots & The Maytals, and playing the role of Joe Strummer, actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives passionate performances of  Clash City Rockers, White Riot and Clampdown. Shays coming-of-age story is one weve seen before, but set in the transitional late-70s, it will take older viewers back, and give younger viewers a taste of the times.

4246702,5,B0041VALL2,Great story about a young man forced to grow up too quickly one summer due to family issues. Great music by the Clash and other bands.,1477180800,,134,4.1923076923076925
4246703,5,B0041VALL2,"Thatcher-era England was in economic collapse with strikes and catastrophic loss of factories, foundries and mining jobs.  Each and every bit of scenery reminds us of the struggle blue-collar workers were enduring.  Rather than being a biography of the Clash or Strummer himself, this was a story about a young boy and his family in dire straights; a young boy who happens to meet Joe Strummer.  Strummer was a good man in real life and was portrayed as such in the film.

Daniel Hiddlestone plays the young son.  His wit, his humility and endearing goodness reminds me of what actor James McAvoy might have been as a boy.  These two even bear an uncanny resemble to each other.

The film was an absolute pleasure to watch, with a few wise lessons about suffering and responsibility as well.  Well done to all who worked on this project; well done.",1476921600,,848,4.6824324324324325

4246705,4,B0041VALL2,"As a Clash fan, I liked the film. That said, the story truly revolves around Shay, the young protagonist struggling to cope with his parents' divorce. He is forced to financially care for his family and raise his younger sister. On a trip to the capital he becomes fascinated with the cultural and musical scene while striking up a friendship with Vivian. His experiences seeing the Clash while keeping his family afloat represent the core of the film. Additionally, I like how they tried to capture the historical and social context of Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In terms of the representation of Strummer, and to a way lesser extent the Clash, the film does border on caricature and staidness. The depiction of the band is too sanitary and misses the grittiness and unpolished nature of the group. Paul Simonon in particular looks like a member of Simple Minds rather than the Clash. The only thing they get right is Topper's karate suit. But in the end, the film does capture the spirit of the Joe Strummer, an imperfect human being who nonetheless had the ability to inspire people. In his better moments, Strummer embraced his fans and was willing to go the extra mile for them. This was clearly a man who contemplated the world around him and his place in it. In the end, the film captures this and makes it worth your time.
P.S. Ray Gange cameo appearance!",1476403200,,1379,4.655737704918033

8413177,1,B0041VALL2,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  The trailers are not about a child and his first love.  As a punk rocker and rock and roller, and huge fan of the Clash, the biggest error is the failure to bring forth the impact of Mick Jones (Please see Cut the Crap) on the band.  Not only did he form the band, he chose Strummer. He really was the music, and the melody that kept that band together along with Joe, Topper and Paul. This entire story was a negative totally and completely.  I cannot believe that I wasted my time and money on it.  I am one step away from demanding a refund for false advertising from Amazon. This is fraud.",1510444800,2,647,4.103174603174603
8413178,3,B0041VALL2,"This was a rather poor attempt at the British to attempt a Hollywood style musical way back in 1945 ..It was actually retitled and shortened for the American release as ""My heart goes crazy "" ,but this American DVD release has chosen the British title.
Starring  British comedian Sid Field ,it was meant to be a star vehicle for him and featured the film debut of Kay Kendall a British beauty who sadly died too young.
The movie flopped badly and with a slow plot and too many production numbers it lost its way.
However young Petula Clark was widely praised for her performance and it is a real pity she was not asked to sing in the movie .There was talk of an American film featuring Petula and Sid ,but then he died suddenly and so Petula had to wait until 1965 for American stardom ,despite having an active British ,French Canadian and European career way before reaching America !
Quality of the DVD ,like the one in the UK is disappointing, with the color being very dark and wishy washy A much better print was used when it was shown on British TV in the 1990's. Still worth seeing though,but then I am a big Petula Clark fan !",1507680000,,1135,4.37914691943128

8413180,2,B0041VALL2,Potential for a good little indie film but comes off rather flat and bland.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers brings a little life to it but he's hardly in the movie.  Probably could have used a stronger director to give it more grit and sass.,1506038400,,231,4.348837209302325

8413182,3,B0041VALL2,"This should have been brilliant. Interesting actors, fascinating period to be young in London and the music of the Clash. It's not a bad film but it's not great either. There is an outstanding film to be made about the Clash in their pomp, what they stood for and their ability to move people, myself included. The younger two actors and Jonathan Rhys Meyers were pretty good but the parents of the main character just felt odd. As was the super imposing of real life footage from the seminal 1978 Rock Against Racism. And dear old Ray Gange from Rude Boy.",1486425600,,556,4.514851485148514

This movie explores what it's like finding the magic that is punk rock in that already magical age where your whole life is ahead of you. Do yourself a favor and rent or buy this movie.
