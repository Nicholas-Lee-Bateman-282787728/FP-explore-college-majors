490860,5,6302641977,"Love all the Reynolds comedies.  Glenn Ford plays the perfectly serious, level headed, military husband who has a job to get on with but is caught between a rock and a hardheaded wife who wants FUN and GLAMOR.  Debbie is the somewhat unique young woman who does not want to commit to a relationship with a fellow who is not wealthy.  Her heart (and his passionate kisses) eventually win her over to him AFTER the marriage vows are taken.  In the meantime, a wild trip overseas with a wilder automobile provides the elements to create comedy here. It's a funny farce with many unbelievable moments...which in reality, is what makes comedy work.  They are a great team here, both with diffent types of energy that mesh beautifully.  The end makes the journey worthwhile.",1218672000,4,768,4.7368421052631575
490861,4,6302641977,"It Started With A Kiss is a romantic comedy about an Air Force sergeant (Ford) who marries a girl with extravagant tastes (Reynolds).  Stationed in Madrid, Ford's salary won't make ends meet after they win a prototype sports car in a lottery, putting them in a high tax bracket.  Meanwhile, Reynolds comes to believe they married too hastily based on physical attraction, and inists on spending at least a month living together platonically to make sure they're compatible.  Some of the comedy probably seemed risque in 1959, such as a misunderstanding about pregnancy and Ford's efforts to get his own wife in the sack.  Eventually she is wooed by a Spaniard (Gustavo Rojo) and to get even Ford moves in with Eva Gabor.  But they get it all straightened out with a happy ending.  It's far from the best movie of either star, and not even the best they did together - in my humble opinion Gazebo was somewhat better.  However, it has it's moments and a fine supporting cast. You'll enjoy it if you're a fan of any of them, and it's worth a look for the car, for nostalgia, and for film buffs.",1119744000,15,1092,4.569230769230769
490862,5,6302641977,"""It Started with a Kiss,"" is a must see for romantic comedy fans.  Debbie Reynolds is greta as the loving but spendthrift wife of Glenn Ford.  Their marriage has it's ups and downs.  It's packed with romance comedy, and some touching moments.  Debbie Reynolds is very pretty in it and believable as Glenn Ford's wife.  It's lot sof fun to watch, as both spouse's have affairs and ocme back together in the end. It's very believable.",1052006400,2,432,4.631578947368421
490863,4,6302641977,"I don't know which movie that other guy was watching, but it was obviously NOT It Started With A Kiss. This movie is the story of a suffering soldier who married a girl (Reynolds) who has ambitions of granduer in every  regard, and when they win a souped up sportscar in a raffle, they have  Governments, Internal Revenue, and a bullfighter chasing them to possess  it. Besides Reynolds there is also one of the Gabor sisters, as well as  other recognised actors of the period. It is off-beat, but if you like  Reynolds, its a must! (Definately not her worst film!)",948067200,21,565,4.554455445544554

490956,5,6302641977,"My husband has been talking about this movie for years. He saw it a long time ago and has been looking for a copy ever since. When I saw it listed on Amazon, I had to buy a copy as a Christmas present for my husband. He'll be so excited when he opens it up. He loves the Futura car in the movie. He said that the Batmobile was later based on this model.",1419292800,,353,3.7837837837837838
490957,4,6302641977,"I find Debbie Reynolds and the thwarted Glenn Ford so entertaining in this comedy and all the (well known) supporting actors make it memorable! Debbie is hilarious as the gold digger who falls for a poor army soldier against all her ideals (that darn physical attraction), but things get crazy when they win a custom made car in a raffle, and the three end up in Spain, attracting all the wrong kind of attention from the army's point of view. High Society parties, fancy clothes, Reynolds has an affair with a bullfighter, and Ford is in trouble with the Internal Revenue. A great adventure all round -  can easily recommend this to anyone (even if you don't like cars). Really hasn't dated that much either.",1415491200,3,709,4.672

490959,4,6302641977,"A romantic comedy that paired Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds in a comedy about an Air Force sergeant who marries a girl who was out to snag a rich man.  He gets shipped off to Spain and she sets out to join him.  She hates to be bossed by anyone and does not like to take orders, so military life doesn't start well.  Then she has doubts about their marriage fearing it was only physical and decides that they should live without conjugal visits for a month.  Add to the problems are a futuristic car they win in a charity drawing, a romantic bullfighter who wants both the car and the wife and toss in the IRS.  The stars match up well.  Perhaps a bit too hectic and a tad long, but a good film.",1407024000,,696,4.118518518518519

490962,4,6302641977,Not a bad movie. It's worth it just to see the Lincoln Futura concept car BEFORE it became the famous Batmobile!,1400371200,,112,4.380952380952381

490964,5,6302641977,"I was living in Madrid and going to High School (father was in the Air Force), when they excused us from class to watch some filming of this movie (at the Generalissimo building where their apartment was).  I was standing on the sidewalk taking in all the activity when guess who comes walking by me?  Debbie and Glenn.  I said hello and could I have their autograph, which they said ""of course"".  It was a thrill for me...and I'm a guy.  When the movie came out, I had to see if.  It was picturesque of Spain, being filmed in Madrid, Plaza de Toros, Segovia and other countryside locations.  I'm a 50's military humor fan, so I love the movie; anything with Debbie, Glenn (Teahouse of the August Moon), Tony Randall, Rock Hudson; all the legacy stars of that era.  When you went to one of their movies you could always count on entertainment...The car was designed and built especially for this movie by Chrysler and was a sight to see, I don't know what happened to the car.  Watch it, you'll laugh and smile and take your troubles away for a while..",1393372800,3,1052,4.4375
490965,5,6302641977,Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds are at their lovable laughable best in this fast moving film about a service man who meets a girl he just can't say no to.  Good thing as the girl just can't say no to him either.  Lots of laughs and a fun story.,1379289600,,243,3.938775510204082

491018,3,6302641977,"It Started With a Kiss is a silly movie all around, but it is moderately fun. Debbie Reynolds plays a gold digger who meets a soldier when she is selling raffle tickets to wealthy benefit attendees. Glenn Ford won't stop bothering her but she won't give him the time of day since he doesn't have money. He buys one ticket to win an extravagant red custom car (which later became the Batmobile) and asks her to dinner. After saving her from a wardrobe malfunction a la Bringing Up Baby she agrees, and after one kiss, it's over. They get married.

However, Debbie begins to have second thoughts when she meets hubby in Italy with their new car. Are they really in love or is it just a physical attraction? She puts their relationship on a 30 day hiatus to get to know each other, and their luxury automobile causes quite a few problems for them.

This movie has its amusing moments but it is overall predictable and too long. Some editing and a few fresh ideas would have made it much better.",1375401600,,991,4.43956043956044
