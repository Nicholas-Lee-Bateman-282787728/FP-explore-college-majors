8617114,3,B00FN7K2TE,THIS PRICETag is super overpriced. Why anyone would spend 115 dollars for it's release seems to me being a ripoff. Unless they reportedly do 50 episodes and each episode is 2.89? I would give it 5 stars because I love this show and it's better than SAO it actually was written as a manga first. (It's more fun less dark.) BUT THE Price.,1392854400,12,336,4.349206349206349
