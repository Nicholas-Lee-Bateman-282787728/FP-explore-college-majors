1665505,4,B00005UM2B,"This is a good workout for those who might be just getting started on a workout routine and are looking for something that is not so terribly intense, or is hard to remember.  Since I travel a lot I cannot always bring the DVD with me everytime I go out on the road, but I remember the routines easy enough and have modified them to fit what I want/need.",1016841600,10,354,4.130434782608695

7954657,4,B00005UM2B,Good simple work out that's short so you have time to do it. Ive enjoyed it.,1407283200,,76,3.8125
7954658,5,B00005UM2B,My brother is a firefighter and has done this workout. This workout is not time-consuming--it's 20 minutes with a 5-min. warm up and cool down. I did it while pregnant and had no problems (except with the sit-ups!) and you can increase the intensity to satisfy your exercise needs. Awesome workout!,1176422400,,298,4.862745098039215
7954659,5,B00005UM2B,"First, I must state that I am not by any means out of shape. I am a professional dancer and instructor. I have even produced some instructional videos of my own. I am also an active volunteer Firefighter. So I know a thing or two about the process.

I got this video as a guide to working out after suffering an agonizing fire drill that made me realize I needed to build up my strength and endurance. As fit as I am, the muscle groups needed to haul hose and stay low are in conflict with the strong muscle groups I need to do other things.

Any non-firefighter who poorly reviews this video as being ""too easy"" either did not do it correctly or did not try.

As with ANY instructional video, you have to have some common sense and adapt the workout to your needs. Once you know the drill you MUST break away from the video and formulate your own regimen.

For example, in some exercises, I had to begin with 20 pound weights instead of the 5 and 10 pound weights used in the video.

Obviously, absolute beginners should start lighter. It would be negligent for the producers to assume the user can handle heavier weights. I liked that time was taken to discuss the ""Basics"" of working out (throughout the warm-up) Time that most workout video instructors often spend just ""Babbling"" or ceaseless counting to eight.

The exercises really are designed for firefighters. I can see laypeople having trouble understanding some of the exercises and skipping through them because they seem ""too easy"", But if you understood the practical applications for them, you would put more effort into making them challenging for yourself.

The poor reviews I see so far are due to the ignorance of the user.

As for production value, this video is just fine. Make that Better than fine. Its good.

I'm not sure what kinds of ""bells and whistles"" reviewers are seeking. But I can't understand how bells and whistles could affect a good workout. Maybe thats why they didn't get one.",1152057600,4,1966,4.594285714285714
7954660,2,B00005UM2B,"The few times I've bought exercise vids, I've learned to watch them first so I won't be surprised by the moves and I can see how intense the workout is. I don't think I even made it through this one because I was bored. Lots of video of firefighters. Lots of talking, when I'd rather be exercising (why do they think we buy these things?). Dull exercises I can do even without being in much shape. I would only recommend this program to those who are really, seriously, completely beginning with fitness.",1123718400,,504,4.489130434782608
7954661,3,B00005UM2B,"The item was purchased as a gift and reviewing it,it seems to be the ticket for my son to regain his healthy weight and tone.",1123718400,2,125,4.04
7954662,3,B00005UM2B,"This DVD contains three separate workouts, along with warm up and cool down periods. Two of the workouts are about 20 minutes in length, and the third is a three minute workout, consisting only of three separate movements. The workouts are slow paced and very light. You can combine the workouts to get longer and somewhat more demanding workout, but still the result would be a long beginner level workout.
They give instruction on how to perform each exercise, so you don't need any previous experience from aerobics workouts. They use variety of exercises that work the whole body. The exercises are easy to perform, but you need a light set of dumbbells and an exercise step to run through the workout.
The production is fairly standard. Everything works fine, without any bells and whistles.
This DVD was a big disappointment for me, because I was expecting a harder workout. I don't understand how they can claim that the second workout in the DVD is an intermediate/advanced level workout! For someone looking for a beginner level workout this is a good choice, though.",1085356800,5,1076,4.885245901639344
7954663,1,B00005UM2B,"I was expecting this dvd to be more challenging but it was a disappointment instead. Knowing that firefighters have to be strong and fit, I was hoping that this dvd would get me back into shape after recovering from a hand injury and a massive battle with the flu. I just got warmed up and barely broke a sweat doing the beginners and intermediate routines. I guess I'm in better shape than I thought after being out of my training routine for 2 months.",1078876800,3,453,4.404761904761905
7954664,5,B00005UM2B,"I started getting interested in physical fitness after finding out I couldn't get rid of the 8-10 lbs of stubborn fat I gained over the last year or so. I'm nearly 58 and have low cholesterol (106) and high HDL (48), but that's no consolation any longer--that fat had to go, especially after visiting a fitness store. My slightly older wife, a preventive medicine physician, watched me exercise with Captain Michael Stefano and his three companions and was so enthused with the DVD that she joined in. This may not be a body builder's cup of tea, but as an ex-high school gymnast when I weighed 115 lbs and could then press twice my weight and lift 7 times my weight, I can appreciate Stefano's approach. I never was heavily-muscled and don't want to be. The DVD is encouraging and helpful. I like the pace of both levels. My wife relates to beautiful Terri Walsh and her gorgeous girlfriend--not that I'm looking at them while working out with Michael and his pal. Very nice workouts, good pace, and good for everyone except the muscle-bound. I like the video better than any I've seen on TV. I just bought the book for further exercise help. I feel tighter and more solid than I have for a long time. I've had two operations on my right knee. The exercises never hurt the knee.",1057017600,14,1279,4.541125541125541
7954665,5,B00005UM2B,"I've been using Capt. Stefano's workout for a month now.  When I began I was a bit doubtful, but even after just a month the results are amazing.  Yes, the 'Proby' workout may seem basic, but basic is good when it comes to exercise - the muscle groups that are targeted are necessary for the day to day physical requirements of fire/rescue.  The 'Salty Dog' workout is a step up and as Capt. Stefano suggests, may be alternated with the 'Proby' workout.  I plan on staying with the 'Proby' workout for at least another month before introducing the 'Salty Dog' workout into my pattern.  I highly suggest this workout to anybody.  I have noticed marked improvement on the job as a Firefighter/Emt - I credit this to Capt. Stefano's excellent routine. Some have commented on it's simplicity, but I think that's what sold it for me.  In this case, these 'simple' exercises may be just that, but they are also extremely effective.",1019088000,11,925,4.672839506172839
