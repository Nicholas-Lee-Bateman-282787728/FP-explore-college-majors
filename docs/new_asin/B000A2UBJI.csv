8073023,1,B000A2UBJI,THere is nothing wrong with this type of dance. I am just not interested in this because I can already do it and I do it when ever I am really upset about something so there was no need to buy this. Children do this when ever they can not get something that they want.,1309478400,,268,3.890909090909091

I'm a big dude.  Kind of buff footballplayer sized guy.  So my GF really wants me to Krump.  She says its a great style for my body type.  HAHAHAHA
whatever.  Its a Hilarious!!!!

THis video doesnt really *teach* you anything.  they sort of show you moves like.  like shhhhhh  heres one of my secret moves.  the schitck is really entertaining.  it reminds me of being a teenager and kicking it with o.g. b-boys.  essentially they're philosophizing about musicality. which is dope.  i mean buck. its fully worth the five bucks or so i spent.",1219104000,3,589,4.538461538461538
8073025,1,B000A2UBJI,"Here I sit in my DJ room typing on a computer instead of watching this CD all because it's won't play on either of my laptops. As someone who plays most of his DVDs on laptops, this is simply too much of an inconvenience. I still look forward to watching the DVDs when I get around to sitting in front of an actual TV with an actual DVD player, but I won't be recommending the series to anyone.",1185840000,,394,4.064102564102564
