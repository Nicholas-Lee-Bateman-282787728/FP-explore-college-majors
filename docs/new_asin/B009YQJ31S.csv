5372940,5,B009YQJ31S,"Wow. This is the best documentary I've seen in a long time. It presents a powerful, moving story - Lithuania's desire for freedom from the Soviet Union - in a well-paced and enthralling way. Sports can be more than just a game; in this case, basketball was an emblem of a nation's pride, and even a method of achieving its liberty. Plenty of game clips and other action shots are shown, along with lots of fascinating commentary from the Lithuanian players, Americans who reported on and/or helped them, American stars who played with or against them, important officials (the head of the country was a brave and inspiring guy), and even Grateful Dead representatives. Warning: there are some mildly gory scenes as the Soviets crack down on Lithuanian independence. But they're more than outweighed by the emotional and uplifting moments. See it!",1358812800,2,846,4.964788732394366
5372941,5,B009YQJ31S,"I saw this documentary at Sundance last year.  A friend was coming to town and requested that I try to get tickets.  I wasn't sure that I would enjoy it, but it was fabulous.  I haven't stopped telling people about it for the past year.  I can't wait to order a copy for myself and one for everyone else that loves sports, history or politics.  It grabs your attention from the start.  And even though you might have watched the 1992 Olympics, you are still cheering for them to come out on top.  I recommend that everyone should watch this even if you aren't a sports fan.",1358121600,2,573,4.299065420560748
5372942,5,B009YQJ31S,"A feel good movie about the underdog who fought for freedom on the court. I grew up in Lithuania and saw it once again become an independent country. A great history lesson for those who still ask ""oh so your Russian""",1358035200,3,217,4.317073170731708
5372943,5,B009YQJ31S,This is a great movie that brings sports and history together to tell the story of the Lithuanian Olympic basketball team.,1357603200,2,122,4.857142857142857
5372944,5,B009YQJ31S,"And it is a must see not because of sports and basketball but because this is perhaps the greatest Olympic moment in history.  And it is also the triumph of an entire country....you cannot watch this movie and not feel the emotion of every player and citizen.

Even if you are not a sports or basketball fan, that is even more reason to watch this movie.  After watching this movie, I'm so proud of the entire country of Lithuania and what a climax to their independence this team provided.

A MUST SEE.",1357516800,3,503,4.434782608695652
5372945,5,B009YQJ31S,"Uplifting story about a small country overcoming the stigma of oppression through Basketball, with some help from the Grateful Dead! I had no idea of Lithuania's place in basketball history and more people need to hear this story!",1356825600,2,230,5.078947368421052
5372946,5,B009YQJ31S,"Although I will only receive this DVD when it is released in Jan. 2013, I did see this on the big screen.  This documentary is a fascinating look at the Lithuanian basketball team that won the Bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.  It provides the back-story to how these athletes worked hard and ultimately, were on the medal stand in Barcelona. When Lithuania was under Soviet occupation, these same guys played on the ""USSR"" basketball squad. These guys tell the real story of what it took for them to succeed and the trials-and-tribulations they had to go through.  Seems that Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead came in at the last second to fund them on their successful quest.  The documentary moves between the players giving their story and American basketball players and announcers providing their input.  If you love basketball and love a story about underdogs who struggle and get to the top, this documentary is for you.  It does offer a primer on the process of how Lithuania gained their independence back in the 1990's which does add to the story of what these guys had to struggle through.  It's a good lesson for young people (teens and older) about striving for your goal amidst the turmoil surrounding you.  I wouldn't recommend this for younger kids since it does have some scenes of real violence when showing the occupation of Vilnius TV tower by the Soviets back in the 1990's.",1352937600,17,1418,4.759183673469388
5372947,5,B009YQJ31S,"This is a film about Lithuania and their 1992 Olympic basketball team.

It is a wonderful documentary!  My 11 year old daughter went with me and she loved it as well (and she doesn't even play basketball.)

5372981,5,B009YQJ31S,"This was a gift for someone who loves basketball.  I saw it and it brought tears to my eyes as I hadn't realized the struggles these ones have had to endure.  Sometimes talent even at the highest level, can be limited by outside forces.  It was inspiring to see how these men overcame the suppression and rocked the old regimes and the whole world, with the exception of the primary Dream Team, of course.  When I first saw them, back in the day, I thought their uniforms were nuts, but now I love them and the heart shown by the band, the Grateful Dead.",1404086400,,554,4.298076923076923

It does with charm and wit, but also a keen historian's eye.  Interviews with the legends of Lithuanian and NBA basketball bring the story home.

5372990,5,B009YQJ31S,"I remember this team. They were considered one of the top teams coming into the Olympics, but not considered a threat to medal. That they not only did so, but wore their Grateful Dead shirts for the ceremony. This was a real surprise. This is great movie with all of their real players participating. This a must see movie",1394496000,,322,4.47457627118644
5372991,4,B009YQJ31S,"The combination of game footage and interviews proved more interesting and better produced than expected.  Unexplained was how in the late 1930s Lithuania became skilled enough in basketball to win two European championships.  Also geneticists may want to analyze how a population of 3.5M produced five >6'11"" basketball players presently capable of competing internationally [and why four of the five starters on the 1988 team representing the huge USSR were actually Lithuanians].",1392681600,2,482,5.680555555555555

The ""other"" team is the first ever Lithuanian Olympic basketball team (the players were the stars of the previous Russian team, although they weren't Russian) in the 1992 Barcelona games.  The main stars are Sarunas Marciulionis, Arvydas Sabonis, and Rimas Kurtinaitis. A great movie for sports fans, documentary lovers, or anyone just wanting an interesting flick!

We fight against Russia and we're first country to declare independency from soviet union. People still saying, just because of Gorbachov Europe start falling a part. That is not a case. Gorbachov would keep it the way it was before. Socialism was falling a part and  Lithuanians was first who resist to Gorbachov. Gorbachov send tanks and army to kill Lithuanians to keep them in the soviet union, but we won. It's really good documentary, true history. Anyone should know how did it start and how did we got freedom and after all Baltic countries and at the same time German wall was destroyed. You can see this in this documentary as well. The ""Dream team"" Lithuanian basketball team was a big deal for Lithuanians. By winning against a big Russian team, we have proved, that we're little but tuff.",1389657600,2,977,4.614942528735632

It was so exciting to see this brand new country revel in their freedom and rally a super winning basketball team at the 1992 Olympics. I was amazed that basketball has been so very popular in Lithuania and that so many of their better players have made the NBA as well as other high level teams internationally.

5373018,5,B009YQJ31S,"I was recently browsing the documentary film section at my local library and fell upon this. Didn't really know much about it but I was intrigued and so I decided to pick it up. So glad I did!

""The Other Dream Team"" (2012 release; 90 min.) brings the story of how Lithuania, wiht its rich basketball tradition, was annexed by the USSR in 1940. The documentary starts with the basketball victory of the USSR over Team USA in the 1988 Olypmics in Seoul. As it turns out, 4 out of the 5 starters on that USSR team are actually from Lithuania. We then get to know those 4 players, told by present-day interviews of those players. As the documentary unfolds, we see how Lithuania coped during the decades of Russian occupation, and how in 1991 they won their independance, leading to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where, yes, the US brought its Dream Team (Jordan/Magic Johnson/Bird, etc.), but there was much more at stake for Lithuania. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, kudos to writer-director Marius Markevi&egrave;ius for the clearly painstakingly background work in finding archive footage and interviews with all of the principals, decades after the facts. It really pays off nicely. Second, this is NOT just a sports documentary, as one could expect from the title and premise of this movie. This is as much, if not more so, a political movie about a proud nation that was brutally occupied and repressed for decades. Third, the Grateful Dead played a huge role in ""financing"" the 1992 Olympic Lithuanian basketball team and the documentary features plenty of Dead music. As I watched this, I was moved to tears on more than one occasion. Bottom line: this is a riveting and moving documentary. ""The Other Dream Team"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1364601600,11,1869,4.8375

It was only within the last 20+ years has this all changed, bringing the cultures of American Lithuanians and people from Lithuania itself together for the common bond of basketball.

8545368,4,B009YQJ31S,"Chronicles Russia's conquering of Lithuania and for forty years controlling the people. Their basketball players play for the USSR. When the Soviet Union goes to pieces (communism does not work) Lithuania aspires to send teams of their own. With $ backing from the band The Grateful Dead they are able to make a name for themselves in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Insightful.

In an intermixed story a possible current draft pick is followed. Sub-titled.",1466640000,,451,5.094594594594595

8545371,5,B009YQJ31S,The Other Dream Team is the greatest combination sports/ history documentary that I have ever seen. Outstanding!,1458345600,,112,5.647058823529412
8545372,5,B009YQJ31S,You can read all the previous reviews which chime in about the nation of Lithuania. How Lithuania suffered under russian aggression. What I really like about the basketball aspect of the Lithuanian team ? They are TREMENDOUS outside shooters. You cannot stop a great team that has great 3 point shooters along with all the other fundamentals. LONG LIVE LITHUANIA !!,1456617600,2,365,5.0
8545373,5,B009YQJ31S,"The Other Dream Team is about the Lithuanian mens basketball team that competed in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.  That team included four players who also competed for the USSR mens basketball team prior to the break-up of the Soviet Union and their pride in their countrys independence and their prowess on the basketball court is quite endearing.

But the documentary is more than just about sports.  It is about how the Lithuanians, and these men in particular, coped in the totalitarian USSR.  One of the greatest basketball players of all time, who was eventually inducted into the pro basketball Hall of Fame, was Arvydas Sabonis, who never got to play in the NBA until he was past his prime because of the political system in the USSR.  One player did defect to the US to play pro basketball under the regime, at the risk of his life.

The greatest part of this team is how loose and carefree they were.  The Grateful Dead were solicited to help the team with finances and they wore Grateful Dead tie-dyed t-shirts during the Olympics in honor of the band.

Seeing what these players went through, their pride in representing Lithuania in the Olympics, the struggles they went through to get there, and their post-Olympic successes makes for an uplifting story even non-sports fans will greatly enjoy.",1456444800,,1310,4.816964285714286

8545375,4,B009YQJ31S,The reason I bought this movie is because a hot Lithuanian girl of whom I was trying to woo said she wanted to see it. So I bought it and was suprized with it! I liked the history and thought it was amazing how basketball in a way affected the nation and some could argue was a factor in Lithuanian independence! As for me and the Lithuanian it didn't work out because she turned out to be a pretty selfish person.....:-( worth a shot lol. Movie is good though!,1436054400,,461,4.191011235955056
