We have been very blessed during my beloved Uncle's passing (July 2016) to have not only Anni8 -- the merchant shown here... but, also another merchant name Jason - perhaps his storefront is called JasonsMusic...  anyway -- he and Anni8 were able to get some amazing things accomplished -- so that my family could mourn and celebrate -- my Uncle's blessed life...!

This is a WILDLY popular Alan Jackson production-- and this life concert meets and greets your soul right where it is -- sitting on your sleeve... right after you've lost a beloved family member.

This music brings back memories of Sunday-- going to church... chicken roasting in the oven for the family's return,... and also:  all those fun family events held at churches such as weddings, confirmations, graduation parites... etc...

Jackson delivers one of his best performances ever--- to please his Mother - gospel music produced to soothe the soul of ""Mama Ruth,""  & to his wife & Mother in Law-- and also dedicated to the memory of his ""Daddy Gene,""  Eugene Jackson.

A perfect copy--- and thank you Anni8 for sharing this gift with my family -- and sending it to us so quickly... to heal our hearts.

Jason--- where-ever you are-- thank you for your extreme generosity, too ( we acquired 2 copies of this DVD -- Thank you for ensuring that my family gathering to mourn 2 hours outside of Houston, in Brookeland, TX -- had their Alan Jackson DVD of-- hymns arranged by Jackson & his wife; and performed at the historic Ryman Church in Nashville.  My Aunt ( the one who just lost her hubby-- her high school and college sweetheart;  & the father of her two boys--) -- JUST LOVES THIS beautiful gift of Folk Music,  church hymns.  What a nice gift:  one that heals your heart... & keeps on giving ( a DVD ---  church music., piano & guitar concert ).  This is seriously, excellent quality music!

My aunt will ALWAYS treasure this artistic musical gift that you to kindly provided her, her sons, and extended family gathering to celebrate / & mourn together.

Amazon storefront owners-- have some of THE BIGGEST HEARTS AROUND...!
