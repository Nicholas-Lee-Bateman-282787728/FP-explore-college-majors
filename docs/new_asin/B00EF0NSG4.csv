5910720,3,B00EF0NSG4,"I am disappointed because I expected new program on DVD to be more like old programs on video tapes.

I started using ""Escape Your Shape"" six months ago, but was not able to work out for the past two months due to broken foot. When my foot healed, I tried to start again using a new version of the program. I found that a warm up is too intense and beginner level is more difficult than advanced level in the old program.

Another thing I like better in the old program is that all three difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) are demonstrated during the same workout by three different people, which gives you an idea of what your goals are. In the new program there are three exercising ladies who do exactly the same thing. And they perform all exercises like professional dancers, not average people. I will go back to using old VHS tapes.

I agree with other reviewers that informational part on body types is very good.",1391990400,,943,4.535294117647059
5910721,5,B00EF0NSG4,"If so, can someone post a copy of it.  I bought this DVD two months ago but have waited to do the workout and I seem to believe I saw a calendar with it and now I can't find it.  Would someone at least tell me whether there is a calendar with this DVD.  Thank you so much.

5910722,4,B00EF0NSG4,"I was disappointed that 3 days after I ordered this the price dropped about $4; o well; it happens.
However; I am amazed at how in 20 minutes these workouts are great! Not too over the top to leave you exhausted; but enough to definately feel it the next day. I am trying to get back on the regular workout wagon; and this is perfect for someone who isn't incredibly out of shape.
It is a blend of aerobic intervals with standing and floor Pilates type movements. I haven't been doing it the 21 days yet but I like a workout that doesn't completely kick your butt and still feels like you are getting somewhere.
You can vary the speed of your movements to up the intensity as you wish.
I do wish there was a little better explanation of the 3 different body types; as i have a hard time looking in the mirror these days and being able to tell due to the flab I feel like i have seems to be everywhere. haa.",1389571200,3,906,4.153409090909091
5910723,5,B00EF0NSG4,I love this and have been working out one week and already my waist has decreased and it was not thick to begin with! What he says makes complete sense and I have been lucky in that I sensed the correct way to exercise and had already been applying myself and then this comes along and it is even better and in a very short period of time am seeing results! I also like Edward as he gets to the point and does not sugar coat the truth about exercise and what you have to do to get fit. He is in great shape himself and a fine looking man and what a body! I highly recommend this and I notice there are naysayers who disparage him but if they would just do the workout they would sing a different tune. Some people just do not want to do what they should and instead they live in denial about why they are not fit and trim.,1388275200,3,822,3.9578313253012047
5910724,5,B00EF0NSG4,"All of the exercise programs I have tried in the past have not addressed my body type so I love Escape Your Shape: 21 Day Body Makeover.  Most womens bodies are Hourglass, Ruler or Spoon shaped, I fall into the Cone/Hourglass category- I gain weight on the top half of my body and never the bottom half. Most programs have also concentrated on using heavy weights that just bulk me up more on top and slim me down more on the bottom. I want to do the opposite. I  have learned through the Escape Your Shape program that high repetition low weights concentrating on the top half of my body and aerobic exercise is the key to toning my body.  I have seen remarkable results and I am so thankful that finally an exercise program understands that I am don't fit in to the ""normal"" body type mold. The DVD is easy to follow and yet challenging so I continue to gain insight every day that I follow the program. Just getting my heart rate up each day has made all the difference for my energy level.  The Escape Your Shape 21-Day Body Makeover fitness program took all the guesswork away for me. It really works!",1386806400,14,1106,4.354368932038835
5910725,5,B00EF0NSG4,I have been following the hourglass routine for a couple of weeks now. I am noticing that my jeans are fitting better and my energy level is up. The video is easy to follow and I am done in 20 minutes. None of the moves are complicated and it is fun.,1386720000,24,250,3.9215686274509802
5910726,5,B00EF0NSG4,"I ordered this 2 months ago to give it a shot, and im so glad I did!! My whole life has completely changed! i've lost over 10 lbs, gone down 2 dress sizes and my saddlebags are GONE. I'm addicted to this workout DVD. I recommend it to anyone who wants to ""escape their shape"" - I saw results within the first 2 weeks, I run now, which i NEVER did, and it educated me on what I was doing wrong. I wear tight clothes now without feeling self conscious, my stomach is almost flat, and it's so easy. It allows you to work at your own pace and it's less than the price of a gym membership. I take it with me on business trips, I bring it on vacation, it allows me to workout everywhere and anywhere. I truly love this dvd, I've already got my family hooked on Exude fitness.",1386720000,32,769,4.032679738562091
5910727,3,B00EF0NSG4,"If you are new to the concept of exercising according to your body type, this DVD will give you a fantastic introduction with live models so you can easily determine your own shape.  There are exercise recommendations, two exercise routines, and a 21-day rotation calendar for each body type.  The production quality of the DVD is excellent.  I have only used the Spoon routines, so this review won't cover either the Hourglass or Ruler sections.  I'm curious as to why Edward Jackowski, the creator of the workouts, decided to eliminate his Cone body type from the list.  There are some women who do have bigger upper bodies with smaller lower bodies, so I guess they're on their own here!

Each of the Spoon routines has a warm up, stretch, aerobic interval, leg section, abdominal section, aerobic interval, upper body section, final aerobic interval, and cool down/final stretch.  The Spoon routines are slightly longer than 20 minutes--each about 24 minutes.  The warm ups are a bit too vigorous to start out, and the stretch would have been better at the end after the muscles are thoroughly warm.  There are uneven rep counts in the leg section, and no indication in any of the individual body parts sections as to how many repetitions the exercises would require prior to starting them.  There are also cueing issues where the leader would say, ""Okay, two more!"" and would proceed to do only one more and start in early on the other side.  I feel the abdominal exercises are WAY too advanced--they include full sit ups and long-lever double leg lifts from the floor to 90 degrees.  These two exercises in particular actually target more of the hip flexors/psoas muscles than effectively working the abdominals.  People with back issues should be careful here, especially since there is no beginner modifier.  There are no problems with the remainder of the workout, except as noted earlier, it would've been nice to know how many repetitions of each exercise we would be doing.

Overall, I feel that the DVD's greatest benefit comes from the informational sections.  From there, you can take the information and either create your own exercise program, or even modify the routines from other exercise DVDs to suit your body shape.  Although you can use the exercise routines on this DVD, know ahead of time that you'll have to do your own counting during the leg section so you've worked both legs evenly, and be very careful of your back during the abdominal section.",1384732800,48,2476,4.871121718377088
5910728,5,B00EF0NSG4,"I just ordered this minutes ago...so excited to see that Dr. Jackowski is at it again! I did the old video tape religiously & got fantastic results. As promised, I noticed a difference in 2 weeks, and a huge difference in 21 days. I lost 2+ dress sizes in a month. The workout wasn't crazy either. As I remember it, it was about 45 minutes of various exercises performed at varied speeds (normal, then fast, then normal again, etc), so your body never got ""used"" to it...therefore yielding great results. Here's what I know: THIS WORKS! I am a spoon & I was in the best shape of my life in my late 30's and early 40's when I did his old video. I wish I would have taken before & after photos to really demonstrate the difference. I think it was 3 months & I had lost almost all of the weight (174 to 145), then another 3 months to go from 145 to 120! That's a lot of sins forgiven in 6 months. Most of all, I was proportionate ....a size 4.....and felt great! This is totally do-able & I can recommend it because it worked for me before. Thank you Dr. J for putting this workout back in public view.",1382486400,19,1099,4.164319248826291

5910734,4,B00EF0NSG4,"Two simple workouts per ""body shape."" They are effective, but not overly challenging. Having done intense workout programs like P90X and Insanity, this is certainly less intense. But its a nice 20 minute workout for everyday ""maintenance"" use.",1417737600,3,243,5.421052631578948

5910738,4,B00EF0NSG4,"This video looks great and I can definitely see how you would lose weight, it's loaded with cardio.  The problem is if you have bad knees and cannot do workouts that puts high impact and shock on your knees and repetitive jumping (a lot of jumping jacks in this video for minutes at a time) or running then this video is not for you. I Unfortunately had to return it after only using it once due it instantly injuring my knees. But if you do not have knee problems and can handle constant impact and shock on your knees then get this video. They squeeze a lot of cardio into a short amount of time.",1402704000,8,598,4.2
5910739,4,B00EF0NSG4,"Well, I am new to working out to my body 'shape'. The introduction to determing what my body type was, was a bit cumbersome navigating on the DVD. Once I got there and was able to determine I was a ""Ruler"". I did both Ruler Levels 1 & 2 that day. They are only 20 minutes each; meaning 40 minutes only for your body type. I did enjoy the Level 1 workout - it starts out with 6 minutes of aerobic/cardio excercises, then the next 14 minutes with abs, 1 min cardio, arms, legs, 1 min cardio...cooldown. Time went by very fast. Level 2 had the same beginning - the same 6 mins of Cardio, (I was hoping it was different) with a tougher ab workout for sure, and then the same type of 14 min routine but with different moves (other than the abs, it didn't feel tougher). It is by no means an intermediate or hard core workout. I liked the variety of moves and will use this DVD in my workout rotation.",1402617600,5,895,4.12
5910740,1,B00EF0NSG4,"No rhyme or reason as to the selection of exercises.  For example, they worked the biceps but did not work the opposing muscle group, the triceps.  In addition, they performed minimal repetitions, not enough to fatigue the muscle.  Maybe it would be good for a true beginner but even at that I am reaching here for a compliment.",1400803200,2,328,4.620689655172414
5910741,1,B00EF0NSG4,"I regret buying this DVD, it's actually crazy. Yes, the concept is not bad, but honestly, the instructors forget to constantly tell you how and when to inhale/exhale. They seem to rush to everything, giving you no chance to perform correctly your exercises. The combination of jumping jacks, with so many others explosive exercises actually made my knees feel weak for a little while (I stopped this DVD immediately )
The idea of a good DVD, is to explain what you must do, to makes you feel good about what you are doing. I am truly sorry for giving such a bad review, but I bought this one based on the so many good reviews this DVD has, and I think this is not good at all. I am in my late 30's, I am a fit person, I have never had problems with my body or injuries, however this DVD showed me, that is not the best option for me (probably could be for you)
Bottom line...""to my opinion"" not my favorite DVD.",1400198400,11,911,4.241379310344827
5910742,5,B00EF0NSG4,"I am impressed with this video.  I have one more workout to do and I will have finished the full 21 days.  In that short time, I have become more toned and can see more definition in the parts of my body that needed work.

The schedule that is included on the video is not overwhelming but you will still see quick results.

I recommend this to get started in a workout plan or to tone up your trouble areas.  Edward's description of the different body types and his knowledge about what works for each type is very informative and helpful.

I am planning on checking out other videos from him soon!",1399075200,2,599,4.303571428571429
5910743,2,B00EF0NSG4,"I used to have this book, so I thought the video would be awesome. The workouts are very beginner level and they don't describe other exercises that can be done for each body type. Also, they left the Cone body shape off altogether!  I recommend to anyone who wants to learn about the best exercises for her shape to get the book instead.",1397952000,3,338,4.365079365079365

While I didn't lose weight, the workouts helped me begin to tone some difficult areas (I am a ruler).  I cant say I look ripped in my midsection and arms, these tend to be the most difficult for me, but I can honestly say there is definitely a difference from when I started on day one to today.  This is definitely a DVD I will keep in the rotation.",1397347200,,583,4.132743362831858

8604889,4,B00EF0NSG4,"I'm a huge fan of Edward Jackowski. I followed his workout in ""Hold it, your'e exercising wrong"" in 1999 and I was in the best shape of my life. (I recently saw a photo of myself from back then, which is what got me motivated to try one of his workouts again. I thought it would be interesting to see his new and improved workout.
I have the streaming download version of ""Escape Your Shape"" (I no longer even own a DVD player) and so I think there's been quite a bit of information left out (?) For example, there's no explanation of the 21-Day Body Makeover, just the six workout routines (two for each type). I've heard other reviewers mention the 21 day rotation--I don't know what they're talking about--so maybe I'm missing something really important.
I've done the ""Spoon"" workout 3x a week for 3 weeks (21 days) and I don't see much difference yet (I've lost a few pounds), but I don't think it's realistic that I would. When I did his work out in 1999 I saw significant improvement over, like, 3 months. Also, I don't think just jumping in place is as effective as jumping with a jump rope.
I'm still glad I bought the video--it is motivating me and I have more energy. I'm curious to know what the ""21 day"" part is. I should probably start actually jumping rope during the aerobic interval to see faster results.",1475625600,,1322,4.422131147540983
8604890,4,B00EF0NSG4,"The workout is really easy. It is for that reason that i did not stick to it. I just felt like I wouldn't get results with such a simple routine. This is for people who aren't as fat as me, i guess...
