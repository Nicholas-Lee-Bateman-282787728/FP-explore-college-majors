8205649,5,B000SK5YX0,"In volume 9 of Eureka Seven on DVD, you will recieve four action packed episodes of the show that help explain much and provide serious emotion. Specifically, these are episodes 35 upto and including 38. If you have yet to see the episodes before these, don't read on or my following review will confuse you.

The Gekko has a new goal- rescue the Vodarac priest Master Norb. Norb has confronted Dewey in the capital and the Gekko must do all it can to save him, but Eureka quickly tires of all the fighting. Dewey explains to Norb how foolish the public really is and states that they are easily controllable. When Holland finally arrives and confronts Dewey, it is Dewey who has underestimated his little brother! As the Gekko escapes after making Dewey look like a fool, he begins his master plan...

Now that Norb is on the Gekko, can he show them the true purpose of Renton and Eureka? A discussion between science and religion begins to explain facts about the planet and how to possibly save it as Master Norb and Dr. Bear begin to share ideas while Stoner records it, hoping to bring the truth to the masses. However, Dewey is one step ahead and introduces his Ageha Squad, a squad made to fight coralians and one that is led by Anemone. The masses huddle around Dewey who claims this squad was actually made by Adrock Thurston!

In truth, Dewey causes coralians to attack and then has his forces move in simply to make him look good in the public's eye. The masses, oblivious to this, give him huge support as the true savior of the planet. Dewey has more power than ever before in the series.  While Dewey spreads lies, Eureka reveals to Renton that she actually knew his father! The shocked Renton is mad at first, but later feels bad for Eureka as the two share a bonding moment when we finally learn what truly happened to Adrock. As Renton and Eureka's bond grows in strength, so too does Dewey's power.  Dewey finally confronts the sage council and kills two of them and recieves all the power from the third, now Dewey is in full command.

While this volume is certainly dramatic, it does have its lighter side. Renton's discussion with Holland about his sister explains much about their relationship and leaves Holland as the true hero he was always meant to be. Renton's other discussion with Moondoggie and Matthieu is just plain hilarious. As is Holland's reaction when he thinks Renton has done something that is, in his eyes, terrible to Eureka.

Overall four very emotional episodes of a truly wonderful series. We are still moving closer to the eventual finale. The extras are lacking, but there is a nice voice actor interview and one commentary as usual. Again, the subtitles are in english. As our story continues, we'll learn more about the planet, and why Master Norb is so important.",1193788800,2,2812,4.645875251509055
