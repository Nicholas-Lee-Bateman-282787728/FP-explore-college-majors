This video does exactly what we hoped it would do, show us how to make the dishes we tend to order when we go get Chinese Take-out.

While it does stand on its own, this is best as part of the 4 DVD set.

Some things to note:

* The ingredient list is very quickly shown at start of section, so it is best to pause and write them down because they are not always identified as the dish is being prepared.

* They also point you to their web site for spice and ingredient info. I should note that there is a lot of good information and tips on the site.

* They reference other videos in the series for more detailed instructions

* The video was shot without benefit of a tripod, so it can be a little jumpy and a little distracting

* The background music is somewhat repetitive and also a little distracting

This is a very good video and it does exactly what it advertises, teach you how to quickly make popular Take-out dishes.

Highly recommended!
