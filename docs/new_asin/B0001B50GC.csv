8009707,5,B0001B50GC,"This film will be one of the most beautiful and informative things in the library! I have been a ceramic artist for 20 years and still learned a trick or two here about one of the most (physically) challenging techniques of ceramic production, wood firing! The narratives were great, the steps presented in logical order. Sound quality was good and clear, filming techniques completely professional. Worthy of a TV spot, I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves pottery. I bought it to show my high school pottery class.",1092441600,7,529,4.888888888888889
