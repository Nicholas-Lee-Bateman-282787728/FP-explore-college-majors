8643270,4,B00ILAWK90,"The dvd quality is not ""high end"",but it's hard to argue with the show! ""The eighties""....the greatest decade;which brought us a sitcom profiling the lives of four girls at a private school in New York with the great & loveable Charlotte Rae as their house mother. This marks the season where the season was downsized....bye-bye Molly Ringwald & others,but it gave the show more focus and still kept it's funny,intimate charm. As a 10 yr. old boy when these episodes aired,I was probably in the minority of the viewing audience,but Footie & Natalie were hilarious together,and the ying/yang dynamic between Blair & Joe gave some insight to how teenage girls interacted amongst one another....something I'd be VERY interested in,a couple years removed! I wished TV network made some shows more like this:Clean,funny,focusing on real issues-produced in entertaining way. Nostalgic it may seem;most of TFOL-Seasons 2-6, ""age enhanced"", I'd choose to be buddies with Natalie & Tootie,take some mechanic advice from that cool chick Joe,and lust after Blair and all take eighties hair! Isn't that what good TV's about? Likeable characters that you'd love to be part of their world! Even if it's at the Boys School across town. I recommend for anyone who likes to laugh,has teenage daughters that should benefit from the lessons learned by an all-girl cast,or anyone who grew up watching the show on Wenesday nights and had to watch next week! It's at the top with other eighties sitcoms....Gimme A Break,etc.",1444953600,3,1502,5.134693877551021
