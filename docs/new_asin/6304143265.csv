809455,1,6304143265,Stupid Cheap movie. Why is is even in the Amazon library?,1467504000,,57,4.2727272727272725
809456,3,6304143265,This is a great moving to have on in the background while working from home or while you are doing something else.  It has some funny and sexy parts but nothing I would sit down and watch on a Friday night with a bowl of popcorn.,1467158400,,229,3.9782608695652173
809457,1,6304143265,Not so good. Very slow and wasn't what I was expecting.,1466985600,,55,4.090909090909091
809458,5,6304143265,Saw this movie when I was in my late teens and liked it since.,1429833600,,62,3.5
809459,2,6304143265,Loved the plot and funny parts. Should be redone modern time.,1411344000,,61,4.636363636363637
809460,4,6304143265,"This is a typical 70s or early 80s silly comedy...the kind you watch with a few friends, popcorn, beer, etc.  Same general category as Animal House (though Animal House is better), though this was much more predictable.  But still fun in a juvenile humor sort of way.  When I first saw it I thought much of it was funny, but missed enough scenes to wonder what it was all about & when a lazy day was coming this was a perfect mindless movie to watch.  What I found impressive was how, when the show was made, women had so little respect/authority/avenues for self-expression -- factors which are taken for granted when this was made but which, today, appear rather chauvinistic & repressive.  Women have clearly made a LOT of progress in the last 30 years!",1336435200,,756,4.57037037037037
809461,5,6304143265,"Llyod Kaufman hit the nail on the head with this one. Sure through the years others have tried to make other baseball comedies like that one with Madonna or that Keven Costner (did you know Troma got Costner started in Sizzle Beach)one or that one that just came out this year. But they all are dirt on this movies coattails. I mean none of those inferior imitations have a baseball getting stuck in the crack of someones butt, how can they even compare!",1005609600,,454,4.481927710843373
809462,5,6304143265,"There are certain works which transcend aesthetic criticism and become cultural signifiers, archetypal embodyments of the moment that produced them.  As American cultural hegemony reached its apotheosis and began to break like a great salty wave, depositing encrustations across the littoral zone of history, a sulbime new art form frothed forth - the 70's boob movie.
Any serious student of this genre would have to brand this movie as one of its most distinguished emanations.  The plot - is not important.  What is important is that the director of this movie, in a moment of auteurial inspiration, was inspired to include a scene in which a man exclaims ""I love you!"" to the (authentically) buxom object of his affections and immediately places his head between her breasts and makes a very loud farty sound by pressing them together and blowing.",995760000,9,850,5.057142857142857

Bad acting, bad script, and bad editing.  A special nod to the baseball play by play announcer who is almost the narrator at the start of the film.  Then they forgot to use him again until the final game.",1483401600,,365,4.323529411764706
