7977475,3,B00007KK2Q,"Not awful but not great early 70's Italian/Spanish-made, English-dubbed horror flick.  At the turn of the century an emancipated female doctor is hired to help a research chemist experiment on who-knows-what.  She arrives to find hostile villagers, a chilly chauvinistic welcome at the castle, jealous female servants, and a creepy nighttime visitor.  The visitor turns out to be the family secret; a mad, disfigured brother who is offing the local females.  That explains the hostile locals.  The quality of the DVD is not terrible but the film needs re-mastering.  At 98 minutes this DVD is the most complete that I am aware of.  The film is also known as Scream of the Demon Lover.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1451692800,,720,4.941666666666666
7977476,3,B00007KK2Q,"A not-bad Eurohorror that I saw years ago on vhs as SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER.  It's pretty atmospheric in the European tradition.  The plot is a bit messy but it has a few good twists and turns.  Igor's character, with his love for idealised beauty contrasted with his total repulsion for sex (or even the desire for it) was interesting.  Still nothing special overall, but worth seeing for fans.",1054512000,4,397,4.628571428571429
