8514953,4,B007DCHZ1A,"I note that this DVD version of Die Frau has gotten a number of bad reviews recently, but I wanted to see it anyway, because I like the romance behind the concept: November-December 1955, after a successful revival of Die Frau in the Vienna Opera, Karl Boehm persuades Decca to record the production, but the singers all have to forfeit their fees in order to make budget. Thus, over the course of a couple of weeks in December, the opera is recorded, after hours, in an unheated hall, for free.

That initial recording is, of course, the famous initial recording by Karl Boehm that is the first of the two he recorded, and which was not issued in the US (and re-issued in the UK) until the late '60's, at which time it was revealed that the recording was, in fact, in highly acceptable early stereo.  It's a classic recording.

So this version starts out with the characters in the recording hall, doing all the stage business associated with a recording studio production.  Within the first half hour, however, the characters start to interact -- still in their '50's attire -- as in the opera itself.  So plus one for this recording is the acting, which is superb all around. The singing is more mixed: the three sopranos are all very good, but they are more attractive and better actresses than singers. The male singers are solid, but not great.  To be honest, I think this singing cast is better than Sawallisch, but inferior to every other studio recording.  The most impressive voice goes to Evelyn Herlitzius.

The recording is very good stereo with the voices forward. Thielemann has the VPO, so you know the orchestra will be good.  However, while he conducts a good version, he tends to take slower tempi, and also inserts a number of ritards to point the emotional moments which doesn't work very well.  Basically, there's no fire in this version, and there are certainly places where it can enliven a production; The scene change in Act I to the world of men, the Nurse's scene with the messenger in Act 3: even the ending of Act 2 is taken slow.

So, it's a good version, with the staging much more involving than you might think, and with superb acting, but as a musical performance it's only good.  Both Boehms, Solti, Keilberth, and Sinopoli (all on CD) are better.",1408147200,2,2283,4.623762376237623
8514954,1,B007DCHZ1A,"The singers in this production are good. The sound is perfect. But the staging is a disaster.

8514956,2,B007DCHZ1A,"This dvd is cheap enough that you can buy it for use as an audio dvd and, as such, it's quite wonderful. But if you want a good production of the opera, this certainly isn't it. The staging suggests that Christoph Loy, the director, either doesn't understand German, hasn't even read a synopsis of the libretto or doesn't give a damn what Strauss or Hofmannsthal intended. As an audio dvd, it's worth the price, but as a total opera performance it's worthless.",1376870400,2,460,4.621951219512195
8514957,3,B007DCHZ1A,"I greatly enjoyed maverick director Christof Loy's insightful DVDs of Les Vepres Sicilianes and The Abduction from the Seraglio, where with minimal sets and updated dress he secured outstanding, dynamic acting from his singers. In this 2011 Salzburg performance, he takes a perverse outlook on this hugely enjoyable but sometimes hard-to-follow symbolic opera. Loy decided to recreate a production - the work's initial audio recording made in 1955, led by Karl Bohm and the Vienna Philharmonic, in an unheated studio in the middle of winter with singers who weren't getting paid. Loy places his singers in a recreation of the Vienna Sofiensale recording studio, in '50s everyday dress and coats, usually standing in front of microphones to sing, sometimes interacting on the soundstage, with no props other than what is there for the sound recording. A dramatic setting, yes - for a sound recording. With brilliant singing, rich, warm-hearted conducting from Christian Thielemann and glorious playing from the Vienna Philharmonic, this is, indeed, a superb audio recording - and frequently a tedious embarrassment to watch.

The outstanding singers try valiantly, frequently with strong facial expressions and in the latter part of act one and much of act two, considerable interaction, but this is overall a lifeless, sterile production to watch. When one of the more exciting visual moments is a stage assistant moving a microphone stand or showing a singer where to go, we are in deep trouble. Every time the assistant or the upstairs audio recording manager came in view, I cringed. This and much of what is seen here pop the bubble of the often magnificent illusion that opera brings.

Typical is the following scenario:
- Singer comes in front of mic, starts and finishes singing, and walks off stage.
- Next singer comes out and does similarly.
- If two singers are on stage, they may even make eye contact and have some interplay, sometimes quite movingly, trying to overcome the physical shackles Loy has saddled them with. One of the singers then walks off the stage and we crash down to earth, the exalted music smashed like a bubble bursting.
- Stage manager moves mic.
- Viewer glances upstairs to see recording studio director.
- Singer opens her purse or removes a sweater.
- Character leaves stage and has a cigarette.
- Individual holds his briefcase while singing.
- Repeat above steps.

- Turn off screen. Leave sound on.
- Take aspirin to overcome headache and frequent rolling of eyes. Try to recover.

What you hear and even some of what you see - no thanks to Loy - is actually deeply moving. The singers, especially the women, sound superb and are visually rather moving, especially so within Loy's strictures. Anne Schwanewilms is magnificent as the empress, fearless in her vocal attacks, spot on in pitch, with a glowing stage presence, her final scene mesmerizing. A soulful, full-throated Evelyn Herlitzius tries valiantly to give Barak's wife a physical character and succeeds miraculously, given the context. Michaela Schuster sings with passion and actually evokes her character, the nurse, on stage. The men succumb more to Loy's stage limitations physically, but have fine voices - Stephen Gould a noble emperor, and especially Wolfgang Koch, in gorgeous vocal fettle as Barak. It's so frustrating: what could have been seen on stage boggles the imagination. They are all supported magnificently by the gorgeous cocoon of sound the Vienna Philharmonic provides and the insightful, glorious conducting of Thielemann. I've never heard the act one finale, the ode to parenting and children, done more beautifully. Others here deserve credit, too. The clothing and hair designers merit a bow. I've seen numerous movies and TV shows from the '50s, and hair and clothing have rarely looked as good as here, all within the style of the era.

Ironically, Loy has indeed made a superb audio recording - for which his talents were not needed! They made a record and someone actually filmed it. Booklet annotator Mike Ashman grapples valiantly to explain Loy's rationale: ""The geography of the recording studio... and the scheduling and hierarchy of the sessions are the production team's metaphor for the libretto's contrasting geography and the relationships of the characters."" This is a reason for filming Die Frau Ohne Schatten like this? It simply does not illuminate the opera. Loy goes on: ""Working with some insignificant real events as a background, the imagination spins out its threads and thoughts and weaves them into new patterns - a mixture of memories, experiences, spontaneous ideas, impossibilities and improvisations."" The idea of having an opera's events take place in the background of supposedly everyday matters certainly could help underline an opera but not in the way Loy has attempted. A recording studio simply does not serve as a helpful background to bring out the richness and subtleties of this opera. You may as well have this take place outside on the street corner.

I find Loy here lazy, indifferent, insulting, pedantic, producing a frustrating intellectual exercise - especially damaging in such a beautiful, transcendent opera. This may be a symbolic work but it is not that hard to follow - when the director helps the viewer with some idea of what is going on. Loy does not do that. When Schwanewilms dragged out Loy and the production team for curtain calls they were resoundingly booed by the audience - following great cheers for the singers and conductor. Visually this is largely an unfortunate event, considering what might have been, had Loy given this the insight he did in Les Vepres and Abduction. What was he really thinking?",1376697600,6,5701,5.098501070663811
8514958,2,B007DCHZ1A,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Picture is fine, as with most blu-rays.

Audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and it is a disappointment. With my receiver loudness level at -5 db the sound stage is quite wide and extents to the surrounds. The orchestra is well recorded and peaks at about 85 db at that setting. Applause is at about 82 db. However, the voices are about 5 db too loud, relative to the orchestra. They also distort at the louder passages, particularly  the female voices. I could not quite figure out whether it is caused by the stage microphones or the body mics. It seemed like as if the more the singers moved to the left of the stage (from the audience view) the more it distorted. At one point the chorus comes in and is staged in the back and sounds fine at around 82 db, but then it gets louder and a bit distorted and the camera shows briefly the left stage where it looks like 3 chorus members stand further to the front where the principals would normally sing. This would implicate the stage microphones. But the voices all come through the center, so I can't differentiate between body mics and stage mics.
Using my earphones just confirmed the poor sound.
Lowering the overall loudness lets the orchestra disappear into the background but the voices are still distorted.
To direct this performance as if it is happening in a recording studio and then get this poor sound seems quite ironic.
And it is not the acoustic of the venue. Romeo and Juliet with Villazon/Machaidze is recorded here and sounds fine. How Unitel, ORF, 3sat and NHK can put their name on this one beats me.
I could not listen to the end of this performance and stopped after the 2nd act. I listened to it again the next day with my SPL meter and recorded the db levels mentioned above. Again, I could not finish it, but skipped forward to sample it to the end. It didn't get any better.
The credits show 6 people involved in the recording, Recording Producer is Arend Prohmann, Recording Engineer and Sound Mix is Peter Hecker.
I would normally return a recording like this, but I bought this for $13 and it is not worth the effort to go to the post office. May be there was a reason for the low price. I'll keep it as an example of how not to do it.",1357689600,3,2643,4.411885245901639
8514959,2,B007DCHZ1A,"I am beginning to despair at Opus Arte opera on Blu-ray. They started off with some wonderful offerings but with the exception of Billy Budd recent productions have mostly been terrible bombs. I did not think they could do much worse than their first Meistersinger and Dutchman but I was wrong. This muddled fiasco is even worse. It is not the singing or the playing which is wonderful but the incomprehensible production. As Strauss matured his operas required increasing attention to understand and this magical fairy tale especially so. This placed an extra responsibility on the stage director to help the audience follow the ever more complex plots. Rather like a Chinese classical story one needs to have it interpreted to make sense of the words. The infamous chicken before the egg! Here we start off with what might be a concert performance with singers reading the libretto and wandering about in a somehat disorganised way in suits and dresses. Minimal staging and lighting, and none of it bearing any connection to the on screen libretto. Yes there is some excellent facial acting but not much else. One needs to have done a lot of preparation to be able to work out who is who and what their relationship is.

If I had paid the hefty ticket price to see this in the opera house I would have been furious. I regard too-clever-by-half bare bones productions like this as an insult to the audience and to the composer alike. Some of the cast are even required to smoke, a disgrace in this day and age. The playing and singing is very fine but it is all ruined by the quite ghastly production. What a shame.",1342656000,10,1616,4.670175438596491
8514960,1,B007DCHZ1A,"That terrible disappointment this first installment on Blu-Ray of the magnificent opera by Richard Strauss ""Die Frau Ohne Schatten"".

A little history of how it went by entering in this work, those who want only the opinion of this Blu-Ray version, skip the next paragraph.

It is an opera that I love for many years back when I buy my first Wolfgang Sawallisch audio version, with Birgit Nilsson and Dietrich Fischer Dieskau, the hurt of this ""live"" version is that it has a poor audio. Therefore purchase Giuseppe Sinopoli for Teldec, it was then where I could enjoy all the magnificence of this monumental work, both the music of Strauss as the drama of Hugo von Hofmannsthal, to date this is the version that I would have the first option, however you have some cuts. As my interest for the work was great buy the Sir Georg Solti (uncut version) audio version, great! With the arrival of new vision systems not endurance the temptation to see the opera and buy the Solti DVD version, a genuine wonder!

The staging of Christof Loy, is more disappointing that you can imagine. Simply all the opera develops as if the singers were in a recording studio, therefore there is no scenery of any kind, destroying all the purposes of the drama of Hugo von Hofmannsthal, all with neckties and portfolios point. That hurts... hope that very soon there is another installment in Blu-Ray of this work. The only pleasure is the see and hear Anne Schwanewilms, that shame that in this production she not can develop their potential great actress that has, evidenced in the Rosenkavalier in Blu-Ray.

At the moment I would recommend. If you want to see the opera: Solti on DVD (Decca), to only hear Sinopoli (Teldec).

Christof Loy, go and take a shower and look for a new job.",1338336000,24,1766,4.683870967741935
8514961,5,B007DCHZ1A,"The fairytale nature of Die Frau ohne Schatten presents some challenges for the more experimental stage director used to modernising works, so it was always going to be interesting to see how Christof Loy was going to rework the story for the 2011 Salzburg Festival. Even by Loy's standards for courting controversy through a very personal conceptual approach, the Salzburg Festpiele Die Frau ohne Schatten must be one of the strangest conceits applied to any opera production. Not unsurprisingly, Loy dispenses with the fairytale setting entirely, ignores the stage directions, would appear to pay scant heed to the libretto, and instead sets Die Frau ohne Schatten in a recording studio in Vienna in 1955.

The idea of making the performance the performance, so to speak, isn't anything new in Loy's minimalist semi-staged productions, but this really takes the idea to another level altogether. The set is built to resemble, in meticulous reconstructed detail, the legendary Viennese concert hall, the Sofiensaal (destroyed in a fire in 2001), where, dressed in frumpy 1950s clothing, the singers here recreate the studio sessions for the first recording of Die Frau ohne Schatten by Karl Bhm in 1955.  The theory behind the concept is considered in the booklet enclosed with this DVD/BD release, but I'm not sure it will convince anyone.  Are we supposed to be interested in the historical performers of the work and relate the tensions of the drama in the opera in some way to their lives? Or is it supposed to operate on a deeper philosophical level on the nature of art and performance?  Whatever the rationale, there seems to be little justification for having singers stand at a podium and sing out to the audience in a work as rich and wonderful as Die Frau ohne Schatten.

Evidently however, it's not quite that simple. There does seem to be some parallel drawn, perhaps, between the post-WWII setting of the recording of the opera and the time of its composition during the First World War. It seems no less extravagant to be recording such a work at a time of great privations (the concert hall is clearly unheated and there are no luxuries in the conditions or the sandwiches laid on for them), but like Strauss and Hofmannstahl's intentions (whether you judge them misguided or not, since the work was not well initially received), Die Frau ohne Schatten is an attempt to reconnect through art with the finer qualities of human nature in response to the horror going on in the world at that time. It's perhaps - and this is entirely my response to the work - the same recognition on the part of the performers in the post-war years of that deeper element in the work that hits the characters so hard, no more so than the confused Empress who is longing to regain a sense of humanity through the acquisition of a shadow, and the horror of the price that has to be paid for it.

Whatever the reason may be, Loy's production does in some way achieve a strong connection with the intent of a work whose purpose and meaning has always been elusive and enigmatic. In the way that it mixes musical references, asks self-reflexive questions on the nature of art and dramatic representation and has definite philosophical and humanitarian leanings, I can't help but think that the composer and librettist of such works as Ariadne auf Naxos, Der Rosenkavalier and even Capriccio (based on an idea by Hofmannstahl) would approve of such an approach. The model for Die Frau ohne Schatten according to the composer and librettist was Mozart's The Magic Flute, but to all intents and purposes the approach is Wagnerian and it's specifically Parsifal-like in its spiritual dimension and its theme of sacrifice and redemption. ""There are higher powers at work"".

Those higher powers are there of course in the music, which, as Strauss intended, takes over where words cannot adequately express. It's Wagner rather than Mozart that also influences Christian Thielemann's conducting of the orchestra and the fine singing performances. Scored for an orchestra of one hundred and seven, Thielemann controls every element of the huge sound that is created by the astonishing performance of the Wiener Philharmoniker, sweeping and powerful at times, and yet full of incredibly intricate, virtuoso touches and more sensitivity and heartfelt emotion than you would expect to find in the strange fairytale nature of the work. It is utterly, utterly beautiful - as fine an account of Strauss's most extravagant work as you could imagine. And as complete an account as well, the entire three and a half hours of the work presented here in full and uncut, restoring a balance to the work as a whole. It's all there and if you don't feel the full force of it in this production, then you must indeed have been turned to stone.

While this must have been extraordinary to experience live in the Salzburger Grosses Festspielhaus back in July 2011, it's to the credit of the recording that it's also an incredible experience in High Definition on the Blu-ray from Opus Arte. The image quality is impressive, but not clinical, with a slight softness that suits it. With a full four hours compressed onto the BD50 disc, there are a few instances of minor wavering and fluctuation in lines, but only if you are looking for them. The audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and both are resolutely clear and powerful, with a gorgeous tone to the orchestration. There's a certain amount of reverb evident in the acoustics of the stage, which seems to be more pronounced in the stereo option, the surround mix spreading the sound a little better, I found. Extras on the disc include a Cast Gallery and Thielemann in Rehearsal, an interesting 25 minute look at the preparations for the production with interviews. Subtitles are in English, French, German and Spanish.",1336521600,30,5859,4.899193548387097
