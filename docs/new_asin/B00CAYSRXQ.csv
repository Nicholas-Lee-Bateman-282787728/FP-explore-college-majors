5710278,4,B00CAYSRXQ,"This was a very interesting conversation, and it features Kurt Sutter who is the writer / driving force behind the Sons of Anarchy, and who also plays ""Otto"".  The conversation displays the relationship between the actors and is entertaining.  I missed the presence of Charlie Hunman and Ron Perlman.",1370563200,6,300,5.1020408163265305

5710280,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"No, this will not give you a Sons of Anarchy ""fix.""  No, it won't help hold you over until next season, and no, it won't give you ANY spoilers about what may be coming up in the storyline.  (Kurt Sutter give spoilers?  BAH!)  But it will give a bit of insight into the rapport of the admittedly strange cast and producer of Sons, and it's got several full out belly-laughs to recommend it!  Sadly, Charlie Hunnam didn't join his cast mates - I would have loved to heard some of his input!",1370044800,,488,4.260869565217392

A good writer and director, but not a diety, for crissakes..........",1417996800,2,463,5.078947368421052

5710347,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"I'm such a huge fan of Sons of Anarchy and this interview blew me away.  To hear how the show and stories develop was interesting and to see the ""real"" people behind the characters was great.  I just wish the rest of the cast was there.",1400716800,,236,4.108695652173913
5710348,5,B00CAYSRXQ,If you are a fan this is a must see. I think this was filmed after season 4. If you are not up to season 4 there may be spoilers.,1399334400,,129,3.3333333333333335
5710349,2,B00CAYSRXQ,"Great if, you know, you like hearing, you know, people say, you know, you know over and over again between every other word.  Too bad.  These are some great actors.

5710351,4,B00CAYSRXQ,Lots of insightful questions answered. It's great to hear how they decided to go certain places with different characters and their reasoning behind it. A good watch for any soa fan. ***spoiler alert**** it was recorded between seasons 4 and 5 so don't watch it if you haven't made it that far yet.,1395532800,7,298,4.6415094339622645
5710352,5,B00CAYSRXQ,Great insight to the show. Sutter's mind developea some crazy plot twists. I am an addict. Hope the show never ends.,1395187200,,116,4.571428571428571
5710353,5,B00CAYSRXQ,Even though it was from a season ago and have watched the most recent and this year will be the last; anytime these lovely people get together for a comi-con or talk-fest it's always entertaining. Charlie and Ron must've been shooting the movie they did together. Tig missed also and he has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. I love them all thus character they play is just plain evil. I love the Hamlet association and just so much about this show. It's not for everybody and many may think if watch it you must have these views but that's so incorrect. If you think of groups of people like this and can be the worst of the worst you want to find redemption in them some how. Jax did and now I don't know how all will be played out but rest assured Kurt want leave us disappointed.,1395014400,,789,4.266666666666667
5710354,5,B00CAYSRXQ,This is a good follow-up of SOA. I love that show. Katey Sagal is great. All the actors good. Would like to see more of them.,1394582400,,125,3.8461538461538463

5710356,5,B00CAYSRXQ,It was awesome and informative. Makes me have a better understanding of the cast and the storylines....the cast is funny and seems like they all work well together...I think SOA is a pretty good show...,1392508800,,202,4.8
5710357,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"From the First Episode I was addicted!! Now at Season 6, getting close to the end, getting anxious to what is going to happen next!!",1392422400,,132,4.32
5710358,5,B00CAYSRXQ,If you are a fan of Sons of Anarchy you will also find this interesting.  Kurt Sutter who is the writer/creator is fascinating.,1391644800,,127,4.521739130434782
5710359,3,B00CAYSRXQ,"I REALLY would have like to see the characters of 'Jax""; 'Clay'; and 'Tara'
They are so vital to the show/series, seems very strange that they would not be included.

Kurt Sutter alone gives you great insight into the show !!
Lots of interesting information, however, I would not watch it again",1391385600,,294,4.653846153846154

5710361,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"Action packed, a little more violence than I normally care about but still keeps me wanting to watch the next episode. Almost always a cleft hanger at the end of each episode. I have lost a lot of sleep in the first 5 seasons due to not wanting to wait to see the next episode.",1390348800,,277,4.054545454545455
5710362,2,B00CAYSRXQ,Definitely was an interesting piece but Kurt Sutter's public / panel speaking is less than desirable.  It really took away from the overall discussion.  Hearing the rest of the cast on a personal level was super.,1389744000,3,212,4.861111111111111
5710363,5,B00CAYSRXQ,Love the cast of SOA  Kurt Sutter cannot only write but he is a great actor along with his wife Katy. The entire cast is wonderful could not imagine any other people in these parts.  Liked the fun humor of the Paleyfest dvd. These people in real life would be fun to be around.  Will be sorry to see the show end but can understand why.,1389657600,,336,4.0606060606060606
5710364,4,B00CAYSRXQ,This was a good look at the individuals who play the parts.  I enjoyed seeing them as themselves.  I would like to see what they had to say at the end of season 6.,1389657600,,163,3.764705882352941
5710365,4,B00CAYSRXQ,"It was kind of fun and amusing.  Actors pretty much always disappoint when you meet them in public, but these guys seem like a fun crew.  Would I watch it again, maybe not, but it seemed to top off the season finale well.",1389484800,,221,4.116279069767442
5710366,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"Enjoyed seeing cast and creator in ""real life""!  As with the show...don't watch around kids.  Language!  But neat to see them!",1389484800,,126,4.904761904761905
5710367,5,B00CAYSRXQ,I love the opportunity to watch these kinds of things about the shows I really like.  It's good to get insight into the creation and acting and everything.  This video from Paleyfest was great.,1389139200,,193,4.647058823529412

5710371,1,B00CAYSRXQ,"There was no Jax!!!!  I mean I am interested in the other charactors but everyone likes Jax the most.  Wish he still wore his hair ""cut"" like season 3 or 4  instead of combed back!",1386374400,3,180,4.085714285714285
5710372,5,B00CAYSRXQ,This was a great insight on the characters and the writers. I had no idea some of the connections these actors had with each other and their characters. Definitely recommend to any one who wants to hear more from Kurt or any other of the actors connected to this show. Love watching the show every week.,1383868800,10,303,4.428571428571429

5710374,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"It's was nice to see the characters as ""real people"". I was hoping that it wouldn't ruin the shows badness and it didn't.
I spent most of my life on the back of a Harley. It's ashame that this is the last season.

5710375,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"I watched SOA Season 1 thru 4 just days after Charlie Hunnam was cast as Christian Grey (yes...I am going there!) I was ready to protest the casting because his was not on MY short list...how dare they!!!

My bestie told me not to sleep on Charlie and she reminded me she told me I would enjoy SOA some 3 seasons ago. I binge watched on her word and became an instant fan and probably a SOA/ Hunnam addict! I was unable to stream Season 5 on Netflix with only 6 days before Season 6 was to premiere so I contemplated purchasing Season 6 via Amazon Instant for $31.

Streaming the Live at PALYFEST was the push I needed to make the purchase. Seeing Kurt Sutter and most of the cast  (no Charlie or Ron) talk about the show sealed the deal. Watching the actors talk about their roles and each other seemed like a true love fest for us fans! Taking questions from the audience made me feel as if I could have been there.",1380067200,6,917,4.198863636363637
5710376,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"Very enjoyable look at what goes on behind the scenes on SOA. The panel had most of the actors, had a good moderator, and went well over an hour. I wish I could find more shows like it to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes.",1378512000,2,236,3.9375

5710378,4,B00CAYSRXQ,Very interesting commentary. Kurt had some interesting insights into the show. I wish he would have given some more details but overall it was a good video for those who love the show.,1377561600,,184,4.606060606060606
5710379,5,B00CAYSRXQ,OMG! Each actor was so amazingly real in there answers and how passionate they are about the series. Loved hearing Sutter just say it how it is & how he came about doing the series. I thought the way that Katey Sagal explained how each character has there only little story along with main story line. You fall in love with each of them and can't wait to see what they will face next. I was so hooked from the first episode and shared it with my 23yr old nephew who now is also hooked. Way to go Ken Sutter for bringing this story to life. Cant wait for season 6 to start 9/10/13,1377043200,,579,4.087719298245614
5710380,5,B00CAYSRXQ,"This show has it all...  Adventure, love stories, both happy and sad- mostly sad, action, drama, a little comedy, and most of all-quality acting!!!  This show raises the bar for the rest  of the high grade shows to follow, weather on fx, history channel(great job on Vikings) or any of the so called mainstream networks where good shows often go to die.  The show is willing to question the status quo and political correctness of today's society.  I like it!",1376438400,5,459,4.6875

There of course were scenes that were a little over the top, at times slightly unbelievable, a few blips of s***ty acting and a bit repetitive but overall this is a must watch unless you can't tolerate violence (in which its chock full of)
If you you're down then Enjoy the ride!!",1459209600,,401,4.583333333333333
