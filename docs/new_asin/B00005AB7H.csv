7935199,4,B00005AB7H,"It wasn't as good as Night of Abandon, which I think is the best of the Red Shoe Diaries series, it was great nevertheless. However, I just have one comment about the product. What's up with the price? I was browsing this site and was about to buy it, then I check it and couldn't believe my eyes; 105 dollars for a used copy and 179 for a new one, that's more money than the entire Band of Brothers collection. I had a quick change of thought. I think that those sellers are to reconsider.",1103500800,3,490,4.168421052631579
7935200,4,B00005AB7H,"Red Shoe Diaries 18 -- Strip Poker
Being repetitive, because in some respects the same can be said of every Red Shoe Diaries story, if you want eye-candy alone go elsewhere and enjoy. If you want eye-candy (always), mind-candy (often), skilled actors (always) and easy-to-hear music, try one. Then try to stay out of bed.
In Strip Poker, a woman who's out of touch with herself and with life becomes a camera-wielding voyeur.
The second story, Hard Labor, is set in the advertising industry, which I don't understand. A story within the story may appeal. I find Jennifer Ciesar mighty appealing.
In Slow Train, a woman reads an independent-minded grandmother's diary. In its account of an event that took place in the 1930's economic depression, she reads of the man who may be her grandfather.",999302400,3,794,4.888888888888889
7935201,5,B00005AB7H,"I bought this dvd and let me assure you all it did not disappoint. This is another smash hit in a long line of Red Shoe Diaries titles. I popped this in my player and did not move until every last credit rolled by. My friends Neil & Iris huge red shoe diary fans agree. This one is a real winner. A must have for you collectors. Iris Is a true lover of red underwear maybe why she loves the red shoe diaries. One scene that is commonly reenacted in the Frank house is Iris cooks a meal and sits and the glass kitchen tabke with Neil. Neil wears nothing but his red underwear, and Iris wears a tight fitting black shirt with nice white panties. If this doesn't make you want to watch I don't know what will.
