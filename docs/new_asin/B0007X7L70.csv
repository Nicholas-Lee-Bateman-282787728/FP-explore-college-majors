8053178,3,B0007X7L70,Came on time.  It's OK. I didn't care for it as much as some of the other videos I've bought for my granddaughter.,1445212800,,114,3.9565217391304346
8053179,5,B0007X7L70,My 21/2 year old and 15month old LOVE this! They want to watch it over and over and my 2 year old does all the motions. Its pretty cheesy from an adult point of view but they love it so that's what counts. The songs are older sunday school songs.,1386288000,2,246,3.94
8053180,5,B0007X7L70,"We picked this DVD up at a local charity used book sale, and my 2 1/2 year old won't stop watching it.  She wants to leave the DVD on practically all day!  In 2 weeks she has learned more of the songs the kids sing.  The songs are all classic songs I learned in Sunday School, many I had forgotten over the years.  My daughter loves singing along with the kids and marching or mimicking their actions, and this is one of the few DVDS like this I've found that are actual children singing not teenagers.  I will definitely be looking for more DVDS from ""Miss J"" and her Sunday School class.",1340409600,2,589,4.223214285714286
