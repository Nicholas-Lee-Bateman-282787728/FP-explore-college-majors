2062719,4,B000255LH0,"Before watching this film, I had never heard of Leigh Bowery.  Afterwards, I realized that I recognized Leigh Bowery's and Michael Clark's collaborative influence in a number of avant garde rock music videos coming out of the 1980's.

Growing up in a small town in Southern Australia, Bowery soon left his loving but ultraconservative religious family for the siren's call of London, where the gender bending '80's provided the perfect venue for Bowery's particular talents.  Bowery's interests were in fashion, but not straightforward fashion - rather, fashion as a subversive art form.  Frequently grotesque and always provocative, Leigh's costumes hid and distorted human proportions and features.  His costumes are very hard to describe and really must be seen to be fully appreciated.  Some look like animated doodle art, others like more extreme versions of the outfits Mexican wrestlers wear.  Still others completely defy conventional description.  Leigh frequently used his own body as a canvas to display his incredibly detailed costumes.  Almost all have a strange alien beauty to them.

The documentary is a pastiche of still photographs, film and video footage of Bowery's performance art pieces, television interviews where Bowery was a guest and contemporary interviews with Boy George, Bella Freud, Sophie Fiennes, Michael Clark, and a variety of artist/performers, gallery owners, designers and family members.

It is harder to draw a bead on the man behind the masks.  Leigh seems to have almost always been in performance mode.  Even those closest to him seem unable to give a clear picture of who he was, and Leigh appears to have had very little interest in being understood.  Rather, his whole raison d'etre seems to have been about getting in people's faces and pushing the social envelope.  From the little I could glean of Bowery as a person, he seems to have been a mass of contradictions:  A loving son and a world-class debaucher, a generous friend and a complete narcissist, a tireless party-enthusiast whose brief light was extinguished far too soon.  Bowery appears his most human and humane in a series of nude oil paintings by Lucian Freud where he served as the artist's model.  These paintings are quite extraordinary and revealing.

Whether or not you see Bowery's fashions as guerilla art or theatrical nonsense really comes down to personal taste.  Be forewarned, most of Bowery's extreme performance art is truly shocking and offensive.  I had to fast forward through any number of scenes that made my hair stand on end.

I found some of the most touching and accessible scenes in the film to be the interviews with Bowery's father and sister, who loved Leigh without judgment, and who never make excuses or apologies for him.  I think this is the way families should function but seldom do.

Love him or hate him, Leigh Bowery was unique and original.  When he expired from AIDS in 1994, he left a rich visual legacy which this film beautifully catalogs.",1124150400,,2994,5.086065573770492
2062720,5,B000255LH0,"I knew only a little about Leigh Bowery going in, having seen some of Lucien Freud's large scale paintings of him, and also seeing WIGSTOCK the drag queen documentary in which Leigh Bowery makes an astonishing appearance, giving ""birth"" to Nicola, his assistant, through an amazing theatrical stunt.  I couldn't believe my eyes in either case.

The film is terrifically exciting both as information and as entertainment.  Atlas has an artist's eye and, or so it seems, a tremendously sympathetic, yet dispassionate, insight into the personality of the mysterious and enigmatic Leigh Bowery.  Bowery emerged rapidly from what must have seemed in comparison the very outback of ustralia to the trendy, gender-bending nightclubs of 80s London, one of which he started himself--the infmaous TABOO.  He wore a variety of wigs and costumes, but that's understating it, because the costumes took on a life on their own and indeed no other human could have worn them.  Interviewees claim that, even though some of the costumes were painful in the extreme to wear for more than a few minutes, Bowery carried on for hours in them, having the time of his life.

One nice thing is that Atlas has footage from every period of Bowery's artistic life, from his challenging one-man show at Anthony D'Offay gallery, in which viewers could watch him through a one way mirror, preen and primp himself all day on a chaise longue to die for, all the way to his last performances with the rock group MINTY.  His death from AIDS is treated very sparsely and, I thought, most movingly.  One minute he was here, the next he was gone, poof!  Like a dandelion.  The speakers are all extremely cogent and it seems as though they wanted to put their best foot forward for their late chum, for all of them look fantastic, from Damien Hirst to Boy George.  The painter Cerith Wyn Evans steals the show however--he is totally photogenic and, though no longer young, is the sexiest man in the movies right now.  Sorry to add a lascivious note to this somber review, but I just have to.  He's as riveting as the documentary he appears in.",1103068800,13,2104,4.776243093922652
2062721,3,B000255LH0,"Leigh Bowery was ahead of his time. All these new ""shock"" artists cannot live up to Leigh. The movie let me know more about him and his art.",1101340800,,140,4.035714285714286
2062722,3,B000255LH0,"Leigh Bowery was a genre-crossing conceptual entertainer who clearly has influenced club kids, Marilyn Manson, and many others.
In one of the first scenes of the documentary, they show Leigh falling down as he walks onto a television talk show program.  It's purposeful, but it signifies that he thought outside of the box and  worked against the grain.
He designed clothes, but didn't want people to buy them.  Though a gender bender, he couldn't be minimized as ""just"" a drag queen.  He was also involved in (post?)modern dance, club ownership, music video, and much more.  His outfits are so asymmetrical, blinding, and large that they are better described as costumes.  He was the epitome of contradiction and boundary erasure.
I think in America we associate men desperate to push society's buttons with heterosexual radio shock jocks.  Here, we have a gay man playing that same role in 1980s Britain.  Those interviewed for this documentary are just as freaky as Leigh was.  His biographer's cleavage is hanging all over the place.  One woman looks JUST like Annie Lennox, but isn't.  When Boy George is one of the normal people being interviewed, you know this work has some freeeeakkkss in it!
This film is not for the weak at heart.  It was hard for me to eat my dinner and watch it as much bad fashion and obscenity as there is here.  Not only are some thing gross, there are also things here that can be viewed as racist and anti-Semitic.  Leigh was operating in a time before and a country outside of political correctness.  The film includes some clips of interviews from him and he can barely be heard.  I'm surprised that his voice was so butch when his actions were just the opposite.  The documentary is meant to be abstract, when the makers want to edit an interviewee's comments, they just fast-forward over it.  No, your VCR or DVD is not malfunctioning.
My big disappointment is that there is very little focus on AIDS here.  Learning about the way artists create work but survive this disease is important for individuals of all statuses to hear, thus I feel like an opportunity was lost.  Granted, Leigh himself was secretive about his positivity.  However, I wish the filmmakers had delved deeper here.",1089763200,10,2226,4.8052631578947365
8022265,5,B000255LH0,"A sterling documentary on one of the most original and creative beings of any generation, this give a great deal of insight to where Leigh came from, where he shined brightest and ultimately what took him from us.  SO many of his influences can be seen in club culture even now.",1425859200,,278,4.450980392156863
8022266,5,B000255LH0,"One of the most interesting people the world has ever known.  Leigh Bowery  influenced everybody from Alexander McQueen,  John Galliano, Stephen Jones etc, etc.  A true innovator and supremely unique provacateur.  The world will never  see the likes of Leigh Bowery again. Recommended.",1404086400,,285,5.511627906976744
8022267,5,B000255LH0,"This is a perfect documentary for those who are interested in all things Bowery.
His clothes, dancing, friends, art projects, music, and outrageous behavior are all here for the taking.
After getting this documentary, I had to get the book ""Leigh Bowery Looks"".
I have watched this movie over 30 times and each time I see something new.",1382486400,,336,4.810344827586207
8022268,5,B000255LH0,A must have for anyone in the know about the infamous Leigh Bowery.  This is highly recommended particularly if you're aware of Leigh's relationship to people like Boy George or even his and Rosie O'Donnell's not well received Broadway play based on the life and times of Leigh Bowery who was untimely death is only overshadowed by his noteworthy contributions to art and fashion.,1327017600,,380,4.9375
8022269,1,B000255LH0,"This is a tiring attempt to make a very ambitious but untalented person seem like somebody important. It succeeds only in showing how empty of value the contemporary ""art"" world was during the 80s and 90s, and probably still is today. People who admire arrogant, ugly superficiality may appreciate this irritating movie. I hated it.

For a somewhat similar but vastly more entertaining documentary about another outrageous misfit, but one who DID have talent, watch Hibiscus in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cockettes/dp/B00007M5JD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cockettes</a>.",1243728000,,626,6.728395061728395
8022270,5,B000255LH0,"This movie gives you education on Leigh Bowery.  He was so innovative that everyone interested in art, fashion and culture NEED to see this movie.  It is well done and the ""talking heads"" are as interesting as the subject.  It is shocking, it is over-the-top, and it is brilliant.  SEE THIS FILM!",1213574400,,296,4.634615384615385
8022271,5,B000255LH0,"Wow if you love fashion MR Bowey bring it to you in many format in his creative mind. His has no shame in his game, if you ever want to become a designer watch this movie if will blow you away which you will never forget IT! Trust ME you will take over the runway, ""YOUR WAY"" and make your statement from there. Couture Style it one copy that you can't see or make again what the show LB in action.",1162080000,,398,3.925925925925926
8022272,5,B000255LH0,"Leigh Bowery makes every other shocking artist seem like a lame embarassment.  He made no excuses.  In 33 years, he lived more life than four people ever could.  This film is wonderfully made, with great direction by Charles Atlas.  It is chock full of interviews from people who knew Leigh the best.  It's poignant, powerful and at times repulsive (in a good way, of course).  Leigh Bowery was the most imaginative, no holds barred, fantastic human being I think I've ever seen.  I didn't even know him, but I know I miss him.",1151798400,,527,4.602150537634409
8022273,5,B000255LH0,"What can you say about Leigh Bowery? He is/was both beautiful and horrifying at the same time. You feel compelled to watch him but wish you didn't. Charles Atlas' documentary itself however is EXCELLENT. We get to know Leigh as well as he allowed anyone to know him. Interviews with family and friends creates a fairly complete portrait, combined with great footage of Leigh's Club Days.  Leigh Bowery was indeed an Artist in every sense of the word. He himself was his own masterpiece and the world is poorer for his abscence. Leigh, you are sadly missed.",1142899200,,556,4.731958762886598
8022274,5,B000255LH0,"I bought this on a whim, really. I had very little knowledge of Leigh Bowery, only tidbits I picked up from other artists who were inspired by him. Watching this movie is at turns absolutely hilarious, diabolical, grotesquely fascinating, uplifting, and  sad, but ultimately hugely entertaining. No need for me to go into details about the man here, it's the documentary that's in question. It is very well done. Lots of video and film from the era, new interviews with his associates, and the bonus features are incredible, almost an entire movie's worth alone. For anyone with a passing interest in fashion, performance art, or the club scene of the Eighties and early Ninties, this is  required viewing. Leigh Bowery lived his life as Art. This documentary is an informative and entertaining testament to that. Recommended very highly.",1125964800,6,838,5.065217391304348
