One of the most interesting parts for me is that is showed the playful/funny side of Townes Van Zandt.  Too often, you only read of his bad traits, that make you wonder ""Why did so many people love him?""  This movie gives you a clue why that is.",1500163200,3,340,4.184615384615385

This film really captures some of the greats early in their careers.  There is real depth in the film (unexpected).  I was surprised at the  high quality of the film and sound.  NICELY remastered!

The captions are way off -- several seconds late -- which makes the movie unwatchable.  I had rented it before and stopped after the first six minutes, and Amazon refunded my money.  This time, my friend watched it all the way through and said that he liked it.

1883596,3,B00009KP12,"A couple good songs sung by a lot of good song writers cause me to give this film so many stars.  I was very disappointed.  Most of the film shows a lot of song writers either in casual conversation about nothing or so drunk they can barely stand up.  If you want to watch a lot of ""home movie"" type footage of your drunken hero's, this is the one.  If you want a good music documentary of some of the best song writers of our time, watch something else - this isn't it.  Did I mention I was very disappointed.",1447113600,3,510,4.06

It's mostly Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt, which was awesome for me.  I like Coe, but he was really kind of out-of-place in this line up.  Great early footage of Steve Earle too.

1883672,4,B00009KP12,"First of all, I am a big fan of Guy Clark, Steve Earle and Townes Van Zandt, so that's why I rented this.  But it was a little like bait and switch.....very short performances by those three and extra long by David Allan Coe and some other unknown (to me) local musicians.
Secondly, like another reviewer said, there is no plot, no story to tell....just random footage of performances from this era and some minor interviews here and there.
Ironically the musical highlight for me was watching Barefoot Jerry in the recording studio doing an insanely complicated rock-county almost jazz like instrumental!
It definitely captures the personalities of these guys, though, and with some great live performances thrown in, it creates a nice snapshot of how those singer songwriters were living at that time.",1372464000,,803,4.992537313432836

You can watch ""Heartworn Highways"" over and over again and not tire of it. And, yeah, I'll fess up, I just as often go to the end of the DVD and ""join"" the crowd at Guy and Susanna Clark's house and, how can I put this, if one is, shall we say, ultra relaxed [!], you'll almost feel that you're sitting around that table and waiting for your turn to come around to do a song. Why? Well, I'll tell you. It's filmed in the 'raw' and except for a single scene [in the extended and just as excellent bonus features section] where Guy Clark tells the camera guy, ""Listen to that song!"", as a very young Steve Earle does his thing with his great ""Mercenary Song"" and not to mention ""Elijah's Church"" as others around the table do their thing and essentially oblivious to the camera. When Rodney Crowell starts with ""Silent Night"" near the end of the DVD, I'm telling you, you'll find yourself joining in! The DVD is 'that' good and showcases the whole 'gang', viz., TVZ, Guy and Susanna Clark, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Steve Young, David Allan Coe, Richard Dobson, Charlie Daniels, John Hiatt, Gamble Rogers, Larry Jon Wilson, Barefoot Jerry and various others including some home-spun stuff from 'Big Mack' McGowan and Glenn Stagner [et al] at the ol' Wigwam Tavern! And who can forget the sage comments of ""Uncle"" Seymour Washington [** even tho' the ""you were ... 36?"" [!] banter by TVZ flew over Unc's head big time as Unc merely 'corrected' TVZ and made with the ""79"" thing] or typical Townes when it's intro time and he says, ""I'd like to introduce myself ... I'm Townes Van Zandt ... and this is my dog, Geraldine [** and who lived for 17 years!] ... "" leaving poor Cindy Morgan [his then girlfriend and future wife #2] to be introduced dead last.

Hey, no-where on the internet can I find this, do 'you' know: In ""Unc"" Washington's kitchen [** filmed in 1975 and in Texas] when TVZ does two of his tunes [""Pancho and Lefty"" and ""Waiting Around To Die""] where the latter tune brought tears to the eyes of ""Unc"" Washington], anyway, WHO is that long haired girl in those scenes? Anyone know? Just curious. It's 'not' Cindy Morgan and it's not [as more than a few folks had suggested] Leslie Jo Richards [1952-1971] because Leslie had been murdered well previous to 1975 but I can't find any mention in the film credits or elsewhere of that long haired girl in those 1975 scenes. Again, just curious. In fact, and going back to the table on Christmas Eve, 1975, at Guy and Susanna Clark's house, if anyone has a full roster on who was sitting there, please add a comment to this review like the guy who was playing the Dobro or the guy who also had a full beard, did a song and was the same guy whose guitar Guy Clark worked on in his [Guy's] workshop.

""Heartworn Highways"" is a decided keeper and together with its very liberal bonus features, a great buy! As Guy Clark might muse, ""... like an old gray cat in winter ..."" [! -- I love that song!], ""Buy this DVD!"" I second the motion! I'm telling you, you'll be grabbing the guitar and joining in. And if you don't play, humming along in the spirit of the moment! Ahhhh, what I would have given to be around that table on Christmas Eve, 1975! But then, with a little ""mind over matter"" [and a sort of reverse time warp of sorts!], I can be! ;-)

The big thrill for me is getting to see Townes Van Zandt when he was so young, and a medley of his hit was all he had to be proud of. ""Pancho and Lefty"" sounded great with just his guitar, and his insight that the song was about two Mexican bandits he saw in a TV show two weeks after he wrote the song fits in to the kind of time sequences I associate with his music.

But Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, Rodney Crowell, John Hiatt (on the outtakes) and many others are all here in one great big whoop of life. After watching this you will immediately want to go off and write songs.

The best part of the DVD and what makes it a true collector's item is the scenes shot around Guy and Suzanna Clark's kitchen table on Christmas Eve with a 20 year old Steve Earle already showing how talented he is and would become.  Also sitting around the table is Rodney Crowell, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Guy and a great steel guitar player who I was not familiar with.

1883712,5,B00009KP12,"I didn't know what to expect when I got this dvd.  I'm a big fan of Americana music, specifically the late great Towns Van Zandt.  I picked it up, and boy I'm glad I did.

What it turned out to be was a very intimate behind the scenes look at 1970's Americana/Country/Folk music.

This movie has a ""home movie"" feel to it.  Almost a day in the life style.  From Guy Clark fixing a broken guitar, to Towns Van Zandt talking about his royalty check he got in the mail while filming.

You are given a fly on the wall view of these music geniuses at their prime or in their youth as is the case with a very young Steve Earle.

The movie takes you from song to song with with hardly anything in between beside them tuning their guitars or traveling on their tour bus, as is the case with David Allan Coe.

My favorite moments are as follows:
A young Guy Clark singing L.A Freeway & Desperados Waiting For A Train.
Towns Van Zandt singing ""a melody of his hit"", Pancho & Lefty.  Then later talking about royalty checks.
David Allan Coe performing in the prison he was once incarcerated in.

I can't get over how cool this dvd is.  The special features include Christmas Eve at Guy Clark's house, where him, his wife Suzanna, and the boys sit around the kitchen table and jam.  Where else would you find something like that?  That's right, nowhere.  That is why this dvd is so  unique and wonderful.  Some songs sung around the table are beauties, others are drunken Christmas songs that they have forgotten the lyrics to.

It is very hard to describe how unique and wonderful this movie is.  If you are a fan of Americana/Folk music, then do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.  You won't regret it.  Happy listening/watching!",1210723200,,1723,4.389240506329114

Guy Clark, cocking his head, listening with rapt attention to Steve play the Mercenary Song, I think for the first time ever to an audience, was way cool.  Then, when it was over, Guy's obvious delight at discovering a new and exciting songwriter on the block was something I'll never forget.  This film put you there.

1883717,5,B00009KP12,"I really enjoyed this movie. Several Guy Clark songs, John Hiatt and Steve Earle in much younger days, Charlie Daniels back before he censored references to the noxious weed from his songs, Townes Van Zandt, Rex Bell, and a hysterically funny song introduction by Gamble Rodgers. Also a clip of David Allan Coe driving his bus to and then playing at a prison in Tennessee. The high points for me were the song ""Alabama Highway"" by Steve Young, and a song called ""Ohoopee River Bottomland"" by a man named Larry Jon Wilson.

According to the sparse information available on the internet, Larry Jon Wilson was one of the ""outlaw"" genre progressive country musicians in the mid-1970's. His style reminds one of Tony Joe White (""Polk Salad Annie""), and it is apparent from the clip here that he is an excellent singer, songwriter, and guitar player. Being a fan of that music, I am shocked that watching this DVD was the first time I had heard of him. He later hosted a show on PBS called ""Georgia Backroads"" and I found a couple of references to recent shows. I guess fate and luck play a huge role in determining a musician's success. It seems a shame that a man of such talent did not recieve greater acclaim.

Great ""candid"" footage of Guy Clark, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, and others sitting around a dining table, with an unreal number of assorted bottles in various stages of emptiness, trading songs. We mortals are truly lightweights. At any rate, if you are interested in songwriting, these artists, or early to mid-70's progressive country music, you will enjoy this DVD immensely. And if you hear of any Larry Jon Wilson cd's for sale, let me know.

1883718,5,B00009KP12,"This is an excellent insite to what the underground country scene in the mid 70's was all about Spitting on the Nashville scene (something country artists need to keep doing nowadays) fantastic songwriters and bands including Guy Clark, the late great Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Barefoot Jerry  and Larry Jon Wilson are just a few of the talents that are intimately revealed, on and off the stage. The scene where Van Zant's classic ""Hang Around and Die"" brings tears to the eyes of an old blacksmith friend will almost do the same to you. You also get to see a glitzier but still raw side of country with performances by up and comers at the time Charlie Daniels Band and David Allen Coe. The film ends with a drunken Christmas part at the Clark's, featuring perhaps the first recording of future hard core troubadour Steve Earle, helping his friends belt out an intoxicated version of ""Silent Night."" (Did Steve look like Keith Richards then or what?) Anyone who likes real country, not the polished, big hat, Nashville's version of Bon Jovi country that has been trolled out of the so-called Music City for years, this DVD is a must for your collection",1156377600,2,1162,4.724137931034483
1883719,5,B00009KP12,"I was stunned by this movie. I learned of it and purchased it in 2003. For various reasons it remains for me the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis, immortalized in Guy Clark's ""LA Freeway."" I wish David Allen Coe had been left out, but no film is perfect.

The songwriters are shown at their best and worst:  a drunken,  funny TVZ falls into a rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics.

This movie was made when I was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just a little.

I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me.

When TVZ sang 'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical. TVZ does a ""medley of my hit"" and sings ""Pancho and Lefty,"" and Rodney Crowell sang ""Bluebird Wine,"" both covered by Emmylou. Steve Young's ""Alabama Highways"" was wonderful too. It was a look into my past -  and the past and future of the intelligent, emotional music I love best.",1154476800,36,1735,4.488888888888889
1883720,3,B00009KP12,"This DVD starts strong with Guy Clarke down in (I'm presuming) his basement in the mid-70's pickin' and singin'  ""LA Freeway"", as the opening credits roll;  I'm very partial to Guy and Townes Van Zandt (2 of the major stars that are followed around) so insofar as their parts of the DVD, it's a no brainer 5 stars from my perspective.  Some very intimate moments with Townes Van Zandt, as he's picking (""Waitin' 'Round to Die"" in particular) and other times just horsing around with friends and, of course, a bottle of whiskey....  I'm not too fond of David Alan Coe being on this DVD alongside those, as I think his divisive lyrics speak for themselves (and i'm not referring only to the line in 'If that Ain't Country' but, rather, some pretty pathetic stuff from his 1982 ""Underground Album"").  In addition to my disliking David Alan Coe's racial leanings, the parts where he is involved just don't seem to ""fit"".  Maybe if you're a David Alan Coe fan (and I DO understand not all D.A. Coe fans share his views regarding what all has come out of his mind, onto a piece of paper and out of his mouth) then you will really enjoy those parts of 'Heartworn Highways'.  Charlie Daniels as well doesn't seem to fit but, to be fair, I (Spike) can't just 'mold' this DVD into my own perfect cast -- it is what it is!  I'm sure the Coe fans and C.D Band fans and all probably wonder what the hell those hippies are doin' in there, from the other side've the coin.  A young Steve Earle, Larry Jon Wilson, Gamble Rogers, Rodney Crowell and more all pop in and out to add some spice....  some interesting interviews and footage of just regular folk also contribute to 'Heartworn Highways' and, if you can just appreciate the DVD for what it is, scattered and all, then it's worth a buy.  I don't regret owning it, and pop it in every couple years to watch again --- maybe pickin' my six string or ""lookin at my watch"" (Cash, 1994) during the times I'm not as interested....",1152748800,8,1964,4.442896935933148
