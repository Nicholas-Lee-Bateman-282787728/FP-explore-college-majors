The scene where Jiang Ah-Sheng confronted the Wheel King on the courtyard where the Wheel King was acting as a court eunuch and found out the remains of Bodhi's was gone was also cut and a few more.

1131490,5,7885142515,"A website recommended this film as a good kung fu flick and I decided to purchase the movie since I am a fan of Michelle Yeoh. I'm so glad I did! This movie was totally awesome! Plus, I loved the story.

Yeoh plays a former assassin who has changed her identity (and her face) to hide her old life. Later, she meets a quiet, unassuming man (played by Jung Woo Sung...who is gorgeous!) and gets married. Unfortunately, Yeoh can't hide from her past and a chance trip to the bank starts to unravel her new life, as she discovers everyone is not who they may seem.

Of course, there are more twist and turns, but what really set this movie a part for me was the wonderful chemistry between Yeoh and Sung. I enjoyed watching their romance unfold. Plus, there were some truly comical moments as the two of them settle into married life. This is where the comparions to ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" come into play. Still, ""Reign of Assassins"" stands on its own as a great movie with some stunning action.

Speaking of the action, it's purely wire-fu and swords, which is alright with me. Though, if you're looking for a film with a lot of hand to hand combat then this is not for you. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic movie which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I am sad to see this has not been released in North America on Blu-Ray. I prefer Blu-ray quality, but not the blu ray import price. Hopefully the Weinstein Company, who owns the North American rights, will release this on blu ray soon. This movie is so good I will likely buy another copy. :-)",1341964800,,1531,4.3992932862190814
1131491,5,7885142515,"I Love this movie. It's one of the best martial arts movies I've seen in a long time, and I have to say that I like it better than ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which it seems to be compared to a lot - probably because of Michelle Yeoh, and it's historical settings.
I really enjoy watching foreign films, and subtitle quality is very important to me; that being said I'm very happy with the subs in this movie. They can go be a little fast at times but it's nothing that should prevent someone from watching or buying this movie.
This movie has many elements that makes it enjoyable for repeated viewing. And I really like the play on words that the title and characters have. ""Reign"" and ""rain"" being a homonyms and the female protagonists assassin name being Drizzle.",1340755200,,774,4.535714285714286
1131492,5,7885142515,"If you favor classic wuxia cinema... if you're partial to movies showcasing martial chivalry... if you've got a yen for Michelle Yeoh... then find a way to nab a copy of REIGN OF ASSASSINS. Michelle Yeoh is pushing fifty at this stage in her career, but damn if she's still not holding it down for all the badass female martial artists in film.

The plot unfolds like so: In ancient China, the enlightened Monk Bodhi journeyed from India to China. And such was his spiritual aura and such was his mastery of kung-fu that when he perished, rumors circulated that whosoever possesses and studies his remains will gain the secrets of the martial arts universe. But then the Monk Bodhi's dessicated corpse was split into two halves.

800 years later (but still very much in ancient China), the story proper opens with the introduction of the Dark Stone guild, a team of elite assassins that had just procured one half of what's left of Monk Bodhi. Except that it's a fleeting possession. Shockingly, one of their own, the Dark Stone killer known as Drizzle (Kelly Lin), steals away with the half and successfully vanishes, never mind the gnashing of teeth by the Dark Stone leader, the Wheel King... and never mind the copious bounties placed on Drizzle's head.

The magic of cinema allows us insight the Dark Stone guild would kill to have. We eyeball Drizzle as she undergoes cosmetic surgery and wakes up with a new face, a new identity. But, wait, before that, she gets schooled by a wise monk who reveals the weaknesses to her signature 41-stroke Water-Shedding Sword technique. Drizzle, you see, earned her name because of this dazzling maneuver, comprising a barrage of slashes executed so expertly and so quickly, it seems as if her victims had been sliced up by drizzling rain. Except that this move of Drizzle's leaves her exposed to several lethal counters.

But Drizzle's gone. In her stead is Zeng Jing (Michelle Yeoh), a friendly enough woman but pretty reclusive. And who knows how solitary Zeng Jing's life would've continued on had the local courier Jiang Ah-Sheng (South Korean actor Jung Woo Sung) not become smitten with her. Fortunately, Ah-Sheng's humorous wooing of Zeng Jing is kept to a minimum, and so the film avoids falling into that pitfall of obnoxious broad comedy. Zeng Jing, guarded as she is, sees something in the unassuming Ah-Sheng and she opens her heart. This would later bite her in the butt.

Sometimes being bloody relentless pays off. When Zeng Jing makes a mistake, word reaches the Dark Stone guild. ""She can change her face, but she can't change her aura,"" one villain remarks, one of several assassins to converge on Zeng Jing's hideaway village.

Even though John Woo is involved in this project, it's merely at a supervisory capacity. Those anticipating slow motion doves or poetic bullet ballets will be pretty vexed. REIGN OF ASSASSINS is predominantly primary director Chao-bin Su's baby. Guy's got his fingerprints all over this one. He ensures that there's attention paid to plot and character development. The story, elegantly plotted, draws you in, and that's also in large part due to Michelle Yeoh's performance. Michelle Yeoh, graceful and fluid, still delivers those phenomenal martial arts thrills, but she doesn't let you forget that she can also act the hell out of a scene. No, she doesn't get too many of those fiercely emotional moments. She normally plays these reserved roles. But her presence is commanding.

Chao-bin Su doesn't neglect the bad guys. He trots out an assortment of colorful adversaries for our reformed assassin. Each of the Dark Stone villains is furnished with a backstory, and so when each killer meets his or her maker, you do feel a bit of an emotional tug. The Dark Stone chief, the enigmatic Wheel King (Wang Xueqi), in particular, reveals an unconventional motivation. Ultimately, REIGN OF ASSASSINS rises above most of the other contemporary wuxia films by dint of an involving narrative, expert acting, a certain groundedness, and dynamically staged fight sequences. I can't speak enough of the awesomeness of Michelle Yeoh.

The filming is good.

Overall John Woo, I think has done better. So even although I tend to like these movies, this one was not particularly impressed with this one. The acting fighting scenes are very good.

Overall considering who directed the film and who played in it, I thought it was not that good.",1319328000,,525,4.447916666666667
1131574,3,7885142515,"This isn't a ""wow"" film. Don't expect anything close to the more ""popular"" wushu films of recent years. It does have it's moments and the fight choreography is decent if not ""impressive"" in areas. I gave it 3 stars for not being a total ""flop"".",1317340800,,244,4.444444444444445
1131575,5,7885142515,"""Reign of Assassins"" (original Chinese title ""Jianyu"") belongs to a traditional movie genre generally called ""wuxia"" - one of the most famous examples being Academy Award winner ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" - in which warriors in period costumes fight each other with swords or other unique weapons in a superhuman way, and its storyline, which is often very melodramatic, is accompanied by acrobatic stunts.

Set in China of the Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644), the film's story centers on the battles over the mummified remains of a Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, which, it is believed, possesses magical powers. Drizzle (Kelly Lin), a strongest assassin of the powerful syndicate The Dark Stone, disappears with half of the mummy after fighting a wise monk Wisdom, who dies wishing her peace in this world.

Guilt-ridden Drizzle undergoes a surgery and becomes Zeng Jing (Michelle Yeoh). She starts a new life with a good-natured messenger Jiang Ah-sheng (Jung Woo-sung) without telling him her secrets. But the Dark Stone leader Wheel King (Wang Xueqi), who was also the sword fight teacher for Drizzle / Zeng Jing, is looking for the missing assassin, and the hidden remains of the holy monk, too.

Yes, the heroine changes her face with plastic surgery, but this is nothing surprising. ""Reign of Assassins"" is directed by Taiwanese director Su Chao-pin (known for his unique horror ""Silk"") and co-directed by John Woo (remember ""Face/Off""?). I don't know what to ""co-direct"" really means, but the filmmakers offer a new and refreshing take on the wuxia genre, of which plotlines tend to be conventional. The film also adds something new to the familiar genre by creating interesting characters. Wheel King's new assassin, sexy and sadistic Turquoise Leaf (Barbie Hsu) is just one of them.

But the film's highlight is definitely the beautifully choreographed fight scenes. They are swift, stylish, elegant (costume design by Emi Wada) and powerful. More than ten years have passed since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and Michelle Yeoh hasn't lost her touch, demonstrating her skills with grace. ""Reign of Assassins"" is an absorbing and entertaining action film, even for those who haven't seen a wuxia film.",1315526400,,2213,5.225352112676056
1131576,4,7885142515,Michelle Yeoh is fabulous. Her co-star is great. The bad guys seem annoyed of being even when she tries to disappear from public. To no avail she has to end her hiding and defeat her ex-boss who turns out to be something else???,1313366400,,228,4.325581395348837

It starts a bit slow with some clunky subtitles that disappear too fast but only in the beginning.  The story is a bit weak as it's hard to believe these more or less wuxia-talented/skilled people could be so dumb as to believe the superstition around which the tales rotates but it's a simple premise that, amusingly, keeps things easy to follow.  John Woo is listed as a co-director and it has his touch of simple, sentimental plot where you pretty much know what's coming yet still enjoy the way he pulls it off.  Michelle Yeoh, no one's actress of the decade, does her usual competent and better job when she's not doing her usual more than competent and ever engaging martial arts.  Lots of wires here, lots, but stylishly done.  Beautiful swords, too",1301443200,,924,4.464285714285714
1131580,5,7885142515,"Does Michelle Yeoh ever age? She looks just as good as she did 20 something years ago in ROYAL WARRIORS. Its good to see John Woo is back directing movies in Asia again. He seems to be more creative when working with a limited budget as opposed to the 100 million dollar budgets he's given in Hollywood. Basically if you enjoyed movies like FIST OF LEGEND, IRON MONKEY, FONG SAI YUK, or HERO you'll like this. This may be classified as a Wuxia movie, but nothing is really over the top and unbelievable like CROUCHING TIGER, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, ETC. Cinematography and nearly all of the fight scenes are excellent. This DVD is also great with a great picture and sound. Special features consist of a ""making of"" documentary and the official trailer.",1294531200,28,754,4.634328358208955
1131581,4,7885142515,"The remains of a legendary Buddhist monk are reputed to have mystical powers, including healing any type of injury.  The body has been split in half with the Dark Stone Assassins, led by the Wheel King (Wang Xuqei), possessing one portion and have located the other belonging to Prime Minister Zhang.  The Wheel King's top assassins, The Magician (Leon Dai), Lei Bin (Shawn Yue) and Drizzle (Kelly Lin) murder the entire family, including the eldest son Renfeng.  Drizzle, named for her martial arts style that 'bleeds opponents like rain', steals the remains and hides in the company of a monk named Wisdom.  Wisdom explains there are flaws in Drizzle's technique that a master can exploit, and sacrifices himself to try to teach her enlightenment.  A disillusioned Drizzle is challenged by Renfeng, who survived the slaughter, but is again defeated.  Drizzle undergoes plastic surgery from a renowned doctor and emerges as Zeng Jing (a slightly digitized Michelle Yeoh) and relocates to a new town where she meets Ah-Sheng (Jung Woo-Sung), a courier, whom she eventually marries.

To replace Drizzle, the Wheel King recruits Turquoise (Barbie Hsu), a sociopath and nymphomaniac who killed her husband and his family on her wedding night because he couldn't perform.  Turquoise is teamed with the Magician and Lei Bin as they hunt for their former associate.  A chance encounter leads the Dark Stone Assassins to Zeng/Drizzle and she tries to negotiate her freedom for the remains.  But the lure of power proves there's no honor among thieves as long-standing grudges resurface and the assassins battle both her and each other.  The Wheel King makes off with the prize while Lei Bin and Turquoise follow the wounded Zeng to her home only to be met by Ah-Sheng, who has a few surprises of his own up his sleeve.  Mindful of Wisdom's final lessons to her, Zeng is determined to find redemption, regardless of what it may cost her.

This latest in the wuxia-style kung fu films lets its pedigree shine through.  John Woo lends his name to the proceedings and there's touches of his influence present.  Anything with Michelle Yeoh is a treat, and Jung Woo-Sung comes through in his role, especially when he's trying to woo his lady.  Barbie Hsu's Turquoise is much like Go-Go Mubari from 'Kill Bill'.  Even Wang Xuqei as the Wheel King was clearly having a good time.

The cinematography is a little grainy but the action is as fast and furious as you'd expect.  Even after a lifelong diet of this stuff, it never gets old.  My only complaint was the way the swords curved and bent during the fights; though it was deliberate, it just looked cheesy.

The biggest problem lies in the script.  Written by Su Chao-Pin, duality is a recurring theme in the story- with each character possessing secrets and often living two lives.  Stories are always important, but when this one tries to be clever it comes off as convoluted.  There are many different layers built into it and though they flesh out the story they still feel like filler.  The plot twists are like taking an off-ramp instead of sign posts to distract you for a minute while still pointing in the right direction.  Events spring up out of nowhere and I had to rewind a couple times to make sure I had it all straight.  It has a 'Usual Suspects'-style approach to it but never quite gets there, coming off as bloated.  There's just too much stuff crammed into it.

Ultimately Reign of Assassins is a movie that sometimes takes itself too seriously but is still fun to watch.  But it's a good way to spend an afternoon and that's what kung-fu movies are all about.",1294531200,12,3620,4.782608695652174
1131582,5,7885142515,"Wow, can you believe Michelle Yeoh is pushing 50? Never would have guessed. She looks great, and is in top form in this movie. John Woo is hopefully done with the Hollywood scene and is back making movies like this his fans want to see. Great movie. This DVD is great also. Excellent picture.
