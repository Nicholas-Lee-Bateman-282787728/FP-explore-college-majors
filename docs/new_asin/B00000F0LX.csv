It is a good movie because it gives an interesting documentary on the life of Cheetahs in a place where lions also live and hunt, without two things some nature films have which I hate:  some dumb darwin/evolutionist remark about 10 billion years ago when we all came from a stray billy goat, or... some other dumb human-hating remark about animals could live so wonderfully if it wasn't for their arch enemy...man.  This is really a good, well written, interesting film.  I wish there were more!",1245024000,,602,4.546296296296297
8459809,5,B00000F0LX,"""Cheetahs in the Land of Lions"" is a riveting story about two cheetah cubs and their struggle to survive in a land where they are ""at risk"" to the nth degree. The cheetah's natural enemy is the lion. (You know, king of the jungle!) And lions kill cheetahs whenever they can. We don't really know why. They just do. In this wonderful film, we are introduced to two cheetah cubs soon after their birth. We journey with them as they try to survive into adulthood. In the process we learn about the relationships between hunters and prey, interrelationships among many animals in the wild, the way seasons change the environment and the changes the animals must make to survive. There are many similarities to inner city kids' struggles to survive. As an elementary school science teacher, I used this film every year to help my 5th grade students gain a better understanding of nature. It worked wonderfully becuase the students got to know the two cheetahs well. They identified with the cubs and quickly got vested in their struggle. And in the process, they learned a lot about nature, and about life.",972777600,,1101,4.739583333333333
