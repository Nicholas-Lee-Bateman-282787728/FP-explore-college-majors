8555145,4,B00AO6WQ48,"Alms for a Blind Horse is a rare offering of intelligent and humane cinema. Gurvinder Singh's gentle observational style encompasses an approach in which the poetic simplicity of the visual compositions situate the characters clearly in their surroundings, while imparting an inestimable amount of dignity to their faces, their bodies, their meager words and plight. His aesthetic is simultaneously clear-eyed and mysteriously poignant, while elevating our ethical awareness effortlessly without resort to myth or moralizing. As this is Singh's first feature, the promise of a great artist whose formal excellence is fully nourished by an equally great heart is formidable, and I look forward to his achievements.",1398038400,,713,5.672897196261682
