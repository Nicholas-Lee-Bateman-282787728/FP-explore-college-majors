You will truly be amazed at her ability to transform herself into a dementia patient in any stage of the disease process.  This visualization really makes the techniques and information Teepa teaches ""hit home"".  You can ""interact"" with a dementia patient with any and all behaviors and challenges when you see these unique DVDs.  Seeing the practical, from the heart, inexpensive techniques Ms Snow offers to facilities and home based caregivers is worth its weight in gold.  The understanding gained by watching these wonderful gems should be required by any facility offering dementia care. In my twelve years in dementia care there has not been anyone who I felt could touch Teepa in understanding, knowledge, insight and caring. These DVDs are the best gift you could give a caregiver.
