8193959,5,B000PYI6WU,"You must grab this DVD (and the others in the same set) whenever and where ever you find it--they are quite hard to find now, and these episodes seem to have been repackaged in a way that is slightly less impressive (in partnership with a new distribution company).

Auto B Good - ""Taking the High Road"" contains episodes from the first season of the show.  It is the 5th DVD of 6 in this, the earliest edition of the show on DVD, (the older, NON-""Special Edition"" set).  These episodes need NOT be viewed in order, and this DVD may be viewed in isolation from the rest of the episodes available on the other DVD's of Auto B Good (but why you wouldn't want all of the episodes is beyond me!).

NOTE: My copy of this DVD has a slightly different cover than the one shown above.  It does not have the tag line ""Full Throttle Fun"" on it across the top, and instead says ""Bible Study Guide Included!""

The 3 actual episodes included are:

CHEATER'S U-TURN - Morality - Where Johnny races a motley crew of hard-core racers employing some devious tricks (which he is oblivious to)--and who have their hearts softened by his great display of sportsmanship.
THE COBRA CANYON LEAP - Dignity - When Johnny's hero--an obvious car-version of Evel Knievel--appears for his farwell stunt in The City of Auto, his aging appearance causes some concern.
THE INTEGRITY PROJECT - Integrity - The one where Izzy and EJ find the Professor's odd, non-funtional machine and he tells the story of why he keeps it around.

NOTE: in future editions of this DVD, the last episode, THE INTEGRITY PROJECT has been inexplicably renamed MYSTERY IN THE GADGET GALLERY.

While I personally feel this release was the beginning of a less-material-for-the-money approach by the producers/distributors (and became a template for the ""Special Edition"" versions now available), it is still a better find than the new, ""Special Edition"" DVD's if comes with the stickers and ""Operator's Manual"" that are actually lacking in the ""Special Edition.""  I am not sure if the version that says ""Full Throttle Fun . . ."" across the top instead of ""Bible Study Guide Included!"" comes with these, though.  In which case, I would assume it is the same product, basically, as the ""Special Edition"" version, name change to the 3rd episode notwithstanding.  Even so, this product currently is available here on Amazon for less than the in-store retail price I have experienced ofor the new ""Special Edition"" version--$15--so it is still a better purchase (but merly a wash if you buy direct from Rising Star Studios, where it is available for $11.98).

This was from the batch of the last 2 DVD's produced for this set, when the episodes were changed from being were around 10 minutes long and you got 6 episodes per DVD--an hour of content--sometimes with some additional bonus material to episodes that are about 15 minutes each and you only got 3 episodes--about 40 minutes of content.  You could choose between 2.0 or 5.1 sound on this edition of Auto B Good DVD's (you have no choice on the newer, ""Special Edition"" ones--not sure what is provided, honestly).

This is the first instance where the episodes were NOT strung together (as they were in the first 4 DVD's of this older edition of Auto B Good) by being introduced by a small (still 3D CGI) group of characters: a young boy and girl and their wacky inventor uncle-type character, who appeared to be ""telling stories,"" which were the actual episodes which then played.  For some reason, they dropped this approach after the first 4 DVD's, so you only get the episodes themselves with none of these other characters book-ending the stories.  In DVD's 5 and 6 of this set, and this is DVD 5, the episodes themselves are slightly longer (but you only got 3 episodes, so it ends up being about 20 minutes less content per disc on these last 2 DVDs of this set).  I miss the introductions by the non-car characters, personally, as they provided the younger viewer with a little focus for what the coming or previous episode's theme was, and served to help string together the few double-episode stories.

Most or all of my copies of the DVD's in this edition (meaning the NON-""Special Edition"" set) came with a set of 12 small stickers of the characters and an ""Operator's Manual"" which is a small, full-color brochure containing a short focus lesson on the character trait for each episode, with reference to an appropriate Bible verse.  Including this one, even though it is one of the 2 in the set (the NON-""Special Edition"" set) that contains less video content.

The whole package is professionally produced, thoughtfully written, and lovingly animated in 3D CGI on par with anything out there (a little shy of the photo-realistic look of a movie like Cars (the Pixar Movie) but just as beautiful to look at--here they went for something only a bit more cartoonish and brashly colorful, which is perfect for the target audience of younger children).  The characters are memorable and well-used to tell stories meant to inspire good character in young viewers.  This, without being ""preachy""--I would say even less so than a show like Veggie Tales (which isn't preachy, really, either).  Most of what plays on these DVD's after you hit PLAY contains no overtly Christian content, actually--especially in these later DVD's, where the episodes are not bookended by other characters who make comment on them.  I would like more of that, myself, but apparently there has been a big push by the producers and/or distributors to get this show into the ""character education"" market for elementary schools, so this is what it ended up being.  Honestly, it still is a fabulous show for youngsters even with little to no evangelical or overtly spiritual edge.  Compare this to Pokemon or whatever garbage passes for afternoon and Saturday morning cartoons, and you'll be running to find more Auto B Good any day of the week.

My 4-year old son loves these, and he has been watching them over and over for well over a year now.  When his cousins of ages 3 through 6 come over, they are all mesmerized.  I love them for being beautiful to look at, devoid of inappropriate scenes and themes, instead developing positive values and virtues.

These episodes are now produced in ""Special Edition"" fashion, which includes 3 episodes per DVD, sometimes with music videos (contemporary Christian music set to scenes from an episode on the same DVD) and a ""bonus"" episode (you can apparently purchase them either way, but for the same price).  NOTE: This particular DVD, however, appears NOT to have a version available with music videos or a bonus episode.  They have not necessarily kept the same episodes bundled together on each DVD, and they have re-named at least one episode (as they have for sure on this one's newer version), making it hard to figure out which DVD you need to complete your collection if you started with these older editions.  Still well worth buying if you have nothing, but they seem frustratingly--almost deviously--designed to require purchase of at least several DVD's with episodes you already own if you want to complete a collection you started with this first, slightly superior, edition.  There are quite few episodes that were produced after this first edition was put out, so if you want to get your hands on all of the Auto B Good episodes, you'll end up buying a fair number of the ""Special Edition"" DVD's after all. These newer-edition DVD's do not come with bonus material of the likes the older versions came with, they do not include the ""Owner's Manual"" or other goodies like stickers, either.  Honestly, I am quite disappointed they moved to this new marketing approach for the retail market.  (MUCH more expensive versions of these DVD's are now available with teaching manuals in PDF form included, or as an ""Absent Parent"" edition with special material meant to be used where a child has a parent overseas in the Service--I applaud both of these editions, but all I want are the great packaging and episodes of the initial set!)

All of which is why, if you can get your hands on these older DVD's, especially for anything close to what you consider a good price, you should snap them up without hesitation!",1218672000,,8245,4.800706713780919
