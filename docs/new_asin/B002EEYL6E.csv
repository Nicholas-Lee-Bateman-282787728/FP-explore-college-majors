8367669,3,B002EEYL6E,I love to watch any documentary on art. This one was okay. I did find some of the artists a bit over weird at times. I got the feeling they were more focused on the way they wanted people to perceive them as artist physically or emotionally rather than through their work. Still very entertaining and put together nicely. Have watched a few times since purchase.,1431129600,,362,4.5
