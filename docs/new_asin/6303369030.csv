8173774,1,6303369030,"You sold me a video cassette ""NEW""
that has been played hundreds of times,
so one cannot clearly discern any more between a man and a tree.
I'm afraid, this is swindle and gouge (unless you didn't nknow that).
more so, if you consider the PRICE I paid for that worthess stuff.
Be sure, this will not go without consequences.",1380844800,,324,4.416666666666667
8173775,1,6303369030,"I received a VHS with John Paul II.  Not the same thing.  I am very sure I clicked the correct button, but then when it was sent, it was changed to any VHS on JPII.",1370217600,,164,3.657142857142857
8173776,5,6303369030,"This extraordinary video collection (3 Videos) explores the life and papacy of a history making Pope, John Paul II:

VOLUME 1 - A Pilgrimage of Hope

VOLUME 2 - The Life of Karol Wojtyla

VOLUME 3 - The Popes of Our Century",1157328000,,223,4.261904761904762
8173777,5,6303369030,"This was an excellent film telling the story of the young Karol, as well as a tiny bit about him as Pope. I found the scenes of Karol in Poland as it was under Nazi Occupation to be the best. The film captured his humor, and his heroism, and his sanctity (done in a very ""true"" way instead of a ""hollywood holy"" false way).

I strongly recommend this film. I'm puzzled by a few of the other reviews- I think they are mistaking this film for another one that's a documentary. This was a regular movie with actors playing the Pope, and the acting was very good.",1112400000,10,559,4.224299065420561
8173778,5,6303369030,"Many people today think of John Paul II as some sort of well-intentioned preachy old-timer set in his church's archaic ways, with little, if nothing, relevant to say in our present troubled times. As this movie  shows, they couldn't be more wrong! We're talking about a bigger-than-life  hero here, if ever there was one!
Albert Finney is astounding in the  role of a  Polish working class priest witnessing first hand the worst  atrocities of the XX century, and putting his own life on the line in order  to stop and ammend them. I don't know if Finney ever recieved any award for  this perfomance, but I do know John Paul II will go down in history not  only as a great pope, but as an example of what being human means!
You  don't have to be a Catholic to apreciate this, nor to watch the movie!",958176000,13,799,4.417808219178082
8173779,5,6303369030,"I really forgot I was watching an actor, both young Karol and the man Karol, the acting was so well done by all. Patrick Stewart as an antagonist was superb.  One can not help but feel the emotions that Karol felt as his  character is formed by the experiences of his life, from the loss of his  mother at an early age and his father as a young man, the ocupation by the  Germans, the plight of the Jewish families that led him to risk his life  for them. Also his meeting with a mentor who intoduces him to St. John of  the Cross, he became a Secular Carmelite as a result and the Carmelite St.  John of the Cross was to influence his life right up to the present day.  It was his dealings with the Communists, as Bishop of Cracow, that gave  such hope to the Polish people. An example was at Nowa Huta. This is the  story of a man who was formed by the experiences of his life which brought  him to the understanding of the true meaning of love.  Not the passive  kind, but the love that acts to restore the dignity of the human being.  It  shows his ability to be empathic with the suffering of everyone.  It  reveals his capacity to understand all sides and to mediate well, which is  part of what got him elected to the highest position in the church.  It  also shows his astute mind and strong-willed commiment to his principles in  dealings with the Communists and others. Keep your kleenex handy, you will  feel this story very deeply.",922579200,17,1443,4.266666666666667
