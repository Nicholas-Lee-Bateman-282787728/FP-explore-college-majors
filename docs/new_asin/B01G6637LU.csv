Elsie Spittle and Chip Chipman share with great depth and love the story of what happened to Sydney Banks, conveying the mystical feeling and power of how his epiphany changed his life and affected those around him. Watching this documentary, you become aware that Syd's enlightenment experience cannot be separated from the Three Principles it revealed, without losing something essential.
There are many moving clips of Syd speaking woven into the film, including his own description of his epiphany, and his certainty in knowing that what he'd found would help the world evolve to a new level of love and understanding, transforming not only individuals, but the human experience as a whole.",1466985600,,729,5.186440677966102
7756165,5,B01G6637LU,"""A wonderful homage to Syd Banks and his spiritual experience from two people who knew and loved him deeply. This is an understanding that is causing ripples of change and transformation all over the world that emanated through a spontaneous epiphany via an ordinary, uneducated man from Scotland called Syd Banks. He was a simple man who experienced an extraordinary insight into how life really works. The simplicity of the insight and the simplicity of the man himself hearing such profound truth gives so much hope for humanity. Knowing that this understanding is not deeply intellectual requiring hours and years of study but a unique opportunity for anyone from any walk of life to hear something new at any given moment of time is incredible and hopeful. There is a beautiful feeling throughout this video as Elsie and Chip share stories from their hearts pointing others to see that this understanding is beyond any self help techniques bringing us to an effortless feeling of wellbeing.""",1466985600,2,996,5.042424242424242
7756166,5,B01G6637LU,The power of this DVD pointed me to what I feel is often missing from the content of the work of the three principles since the death of the founder.  The mystery of this man's life and experience is part of what brought profound change in my own life...the principles as an understanding is amazing - but the gift of the spiritual essence came through Syd Banks - this is the story we must continue to share - and never lose site of the mystery and magic it brought.  Everyone should view this story.,1466121600,4,501,4.319148936170213

8762390,5,B01G6637LU,"This is a treasured resource for anyone currently sharing the Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought, and for all the future teachers to come. As someone who knew Sydney Banks for about 20 years, I was most deeply touched, from the beginning, by his humility in the face of the magnitude of his epiphany, which is truly changing our whole understanding of human psychology, the true nature of humanity, and the hope for restoration of mental well-being to all people, regardless of circumstances. Syd's oldest and dearest friends, Elsie Spittle and Chip Chipman, share their remembrances of the effect his remarkable insight had on them and so many others. It is crucial to the impact of the Principles for everyone to understand that recognizing Sydney Banks' experience is not an attempt to make him famous, but to sustain the hope that, as he so often said, ""If this could happen to me, it could happen to anyone."" He was a welder who, without seeking it, experienced an enlightenment epiphany. He shared it freely, never seeking glory, or credit, but knowing that what he had seen offered new hope to ease the suffering of people across the globe. His life is proof that the true spiritual nature that is our experience of life is universal, always accessible to all people.",1467676800,4,1285,4.872146118721461
