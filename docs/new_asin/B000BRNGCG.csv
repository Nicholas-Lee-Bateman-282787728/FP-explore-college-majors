2439286,3,B000BRNGCG,"Mrs. Onassis's primary commitment (after her husband and children) during her tenure, in The White House, was the Restoration of the building itself. She envisioned returning the house to it's historical past, during the early days of the Republic, while preserving it through designation as a Museum. This Television program, was meant to showcase, expand greater attention, and fundraising possibility, on what she and her newly formed White House Fine Arts Committee and White House Historical Association had accomplished, to date of the airing of the program. Mrs. Onassis is a tour de force, as she conducts the tour, for the 65,000,000 viewers who tuned-in on the evening of 14th February, 1962. She is exquisitely beautiful, engaging, intelligent, impeccably well-dressed, elegant, and above all else comes across as an incredibly nice person. Late, in the program she is joined, by President Kennedy, in what was to become under the Kennedy Presidency, The Treaty Room. President and Mrs. Kennedy are as ever, dazzling and exciting.

I was gifted this DVD, from a friend who purchased it through the JFK Library, and I too, was at first perplexed by the poor quality, of the source video as I have seen the color copy of this program which is glorious, and found both in a Manhattan Museum (or was, at this writing I am uncertain if it still exists)  as well as, CBS in the same city. But, I realized this is what the viewer would have seen in 1962, still I wish the JFK Library would have included, a copy, of the color version, as well.

If you are unfamiliar, with Mrs, Onassis's Restoration of The White House project, a legacy which has been continued, by all subsequent Presidential administrations, due to her protections, this video is a marvelous place to begin.

2439287,5,B000BRNGCG,I have this program on VHS and I really enjoy watching it and being able to see the white house and how she transformed it! However afer reviewing the sellers that make it available here I will buy it on the the JFK website as it is cheaper!,1282435200,4,241,4.041666666666667

It was exactly what I watched on TV when I was only a teen.  She was my idol.  I think every girl needs an idol, especially one that could pull off such refinement and feminity yet a powerful personality in her own right.  Much like Princess Diana.  They weren't perfect, but who is?  I don't see such strong women any more.  I'm glad I can watch this and see the White House as it should be.",1213920000,18,668,5.554455445544554
2439289,5,B000BRNGCG,"First of all, you can buy this through the JFK Library for about $10 so don't pay the $40 that is offered on this site.

On with the review...

Yes, it feels old-fashioned, stilited even but as a portrait of Mrs. Kennedy and as an ""inside"" look at the WH at that time, it is priceless. It is very genteel and very interesting but you have to be a Kennedy or WH buff to get very interested in it.",1167091200,22,395,3.9873417721518987
8091556,5,B000BRNGCG,"Must have DVD for historical purposes! I remember watching the original TV program showing it as I was just a little girl. I watched in pure amazement and awe.
I also have it in a VHS version but everyone uses a DVD format now.
Don't hesitate to get this to pass along history to the next generations!",1524355200,,301,4.298245614035087
8091557,5,B000BRNGCG,I loved everything about this dvd. So wonderful to see a first lady of elegance and class who did much to restore a rundown whitehouse putting the historic peices restored and back where they belonged. Also was awesome to see President Kennedy Alive and i thank Amazon for giving me the chance to purchase such a wonderful peice of history. I was 4 when the President was murdered and have wanted to see this tour for years!!!!!!,1522972800,,429,4.584415584415584

8091560,5,B000BRNGCG,"I loved this piece of a great time in history and my 10 year old grandson watched it with me as I explained that year 1962 I took a trip Memorial weekend to Washington DC that same year, I was 7 at that time and we took that tour of the White House they give tourists that same year.  I wanted my special boy to see the President alive and talking on TV with Mrs. Kennedy.  It was a time I will never ever ever forget and I told my grandson to look up that time in history when he's older!!!  Too bad it was not filmed in color.",1444867200,7,528,3.8256880733944953

8091564,5,B000BRNGCG,"How can you miss when Jacqueline Kennedy is guiding you on tour of HER house which she single handedly brought back from the dead.  Most people think the White House should have be in perfect shape for the whole existence of the building.  And yes it should have been but wasn't!  Jacqueline decided that was going to be her gift to the people of our land who tour the White House and used to see how tattered and worn the edifice was when her husband first took office.  She was truly ashamed at how badly the house had been kept, precious antiques had been shoved in the attic so that less tasteful First ladies could put their stamp on the property, with their choice of furniture.  But Jacqueline researched which original pieces of furniture belonged to the named rooms, according to color of the original decor and history, so she went about with help finding and restoring pieces that had even ended up in flea markets. Early on she knew she could not use Federal Funds for brining the White House back to life because she would have been called a dilettante if she did so. This project proved she was anything but that, in fact, she was a very hard worker, and one who knew what she wanted to accomplish and did so in short adieu.  The book tells that story and more plus gives you the peeks into the inner sanctums like the living quarters of the First Family!  It's a terrific book and one well worth having if you truly want to know the story of the White House revival.",1405036800,9,1481,4.402930402930403
