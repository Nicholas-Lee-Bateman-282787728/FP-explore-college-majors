1354007,4,B00004U3VF,"""Mixing Nia"" is a wonderful tale about a woman, NIA, who is coming into her own. Her problems range from the insecurities about being bi-racial to the problems that most children of divorced parents feel. She has friends of varying eclectic abilities and yet, she's found the interesting aspects of each one of them for which to build a foundation of friendship. The situations with the men in her life such as her father, Lewis, Matt, and Joe are very real and humorous at times. Karyn Parsons is absolutely fabulous as Nia and you will enjoy the cycle of confusion which surrounds her life. In the end, you don't have to be white or black to understand the very real frustrations of the human heart and mind!",989452800,20,710,4.5984251968503935
1354008,4,B00004U3VF,"Alright, I have to admit that the title of my review woud scare away anyone expecting something thoughtful or insightful. That's OK. I really enjoyed this movie. The title Character, Nia, has to learn to accept every part of herself: the Black parts that conflict with her white peers; the white parts that conflict with her Black peers, and the strictly Nia parts that conflict with everyone. What is her solution? Should she ignore one part of herself to develop the other? Or maybe she will feel better with the right boyfriend....
This dilemma is handled in an imaginative and mature fashion. I really recommend this movie.",977875200,12,627,4.869158878504673

7923558,3,B00004U3VF,"I like to dig into a writer's mind, and figure out what message he or she is trying to sneak past the inevitable Hollywood vampires who have appointed themselves as God's Chosen Ones to guard the gate.

The most articulate, well-educated, attractive character here is Lewis, played by Isaiah Washington -- black, college professor, up for tenure at an atypical young age, and -- gasp -- unabashedly pro-Black. So, of course the brother had to be taken down or this movie would never have been financed. And, he is, indeed, crucified just outside the Holy of Holies --  appropriately hung until dead, metaphorically speaking, in front of a crowd of white folks who have just left the temple of their god.

Earlier, after he has lain with our virtuous Nia -- the virgin Isis who Hollywood has ordained must be saved from the evil influence of Osiris [Lewis] -- the writer has a big white guy [Set] drive up, stop behind them, and just stare, in a big white truck with G.O.D. written on the side.

Hello ...

Prior to Lewis' obligatory end, in the scene where Lewis is sitting at a table with Nia and her clueless, sexually depraved father -- a repulsive man who, after screwing around her mama, now gets off by making videos of himself having sex with younger women -- the writer manages to have Lewis perfectly express what should be, by now, the inarguable failure of 60's style integration -- that it allowed white liberals such as Nia's father to pat themselves on the back for ""ending"" racism at the expense of The Souls of Black Folks, folks who were simply moved from the plantation to the inner city.",1185926400,,1606,4.621052631578947
7923559,3,B00004U3VF,I must have been half asleep when I ordered this. I didn't like it the first time I saw it then had the nerves to buy it. I am going to donate it to a library.,1185408000,,159,3.4444444444444446
7923560,4,B00004U3VF,Cute independant flick with an above average performance by Isaiah Washington(the sexy brotha from Greys anatomy) Karen Parsons wasn't too bad either. not a bad movie at all.,1154217600,,174,5.25
7923561,3,B00004U3VF,"The story was OK.  There were some funny moments.  There were some intersting statements made on relationships and finding ones true self, but I've seen better indies.",1153353600,,167,5.148148148148148
7923562,4,B00004U3VF,"The movie has a simple premise. It's about a young woman, who's just struggling with her cultural identity. For a indie flick, it has a good story.",1142467200,,147,4.481481481481482
7923563,5,B00004U3VF,"this was a wonderfully funny movie, and I can relate to its message of how difficult it is to fit in a society that tries to categorize you when you're a mixture, not a single entity.  I myself was born in america, but my folks are from India, and I also have had to balance out my traditional practices with my western ideals while living in the West, both around americans and Indians, like Nia had to find her way to accept being both white and black.  While I'm not bi-racial, the idea of an identity search and crisis is the same, and it's always a feeling of you're too Indian to be american, but you're still too american to be indian, so like nia,  who felt she was too white to be black, but too black to be white, i also had a hard time (and still sometimes Do), have a hard time fitting in with my white and Indian friends.  Yet, I've learned to overcome it, and learned that I should just be me, and do what I feel is right in my heart, regardless of what other whites or Indians think, as Nia learned to just be herself, and she'll be accepted.  In all, this was a great movie, funny, heartwrenching, and witty, and it geows in your heart.  Karyn Parsons was wonderful.  I also want to say she's gorgeous, with her tanned skin which has a rosiness behind it, as well as her sharp features and deep-set eyes.  It goes to show you that mixed kids can be the most beautiful in the world!:)  She should've tried modelling, for I think, judging from this movie, and in her days from the fresh prince of bel air, that she can pass as a beauty queen even in her off hours.  She's just so beautiful, and a great actress.",1097971200,5,1625,4.196141479099678
