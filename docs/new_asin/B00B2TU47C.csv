8561706,4,B00B2TU47C,"After the crazy awesomeness of Getter Robo Armageddon, despite its flaws due to a troubled production where legendary director Yasuhiro Imagawa left the project, people were hungry for more over the top super robot resurrections. Shin Getter Robo vs. Neo Getter Robo continued the trend with this four-episode OVA that ends up being a great movie-length ride.

Much of the plot involves re-imagining the Getter Robo Go Manga, making up for the very generic and light-hearted ""Go"" anime that came before it. It also incorporates some of its own stuff like bringing back Texas Mack, an obscure robot from one episode of the original Getter Robo anime that ends up becoming one of the funniest and most memorable characters of the OVA due to his ridiculous American stereotyping and Engrish speech.

Ultimately Shin vs. Neo is low on brains and high on action but it has fun with its material the entire time and never sinks into the dreary post-apocalyptic depression that drags down some of the middle episodes of Armageddon and its short run-time makes for an entertaining afternoon. The final battle is a little rushed and anti-climactic but the overall ride is worth it.

Great for lovers of action and a must have for lovers of Getter Robo or Dynamic family super robots.",1467331200,2,1274,4.916279069767442
8561707,4,B00B2TU47C,"Neo Getter vs Shin Getter is like a roller coaster. The first half takes you up high then the 2nd half makes you feel like there should have been more story which they, did in the Super Robot Wars game series. It just felt like it was too short. The good point is that they did their best to focus on the new Getter team....then again.....the ending felt rushed for an OVA series that gave you the feeling that it was going to be longer.",1464220800,2,437,4.152941176470589

Audio:
The Japanese audio comes across clear in Dolby Digital 2.0 and there was no real distortion issue of any kind during playback.

Video:
The series was released originally in 2000 and still looks relatively decent for an OAV from this time period. The picture quality is colorful, sharp and overall visually pleasing.

In Summary
All in all, Ive had fun watching Shin Getter Robo VS. Neo Getter Robo since it doesnt require as much brainpower as some of my favorite anime. The super robot genre had mostly gone dormant in the 90s, but enjoyed a renaissance with works like Giant Robo and Brave King Gaogaigar at the time. This series definitely played a role in revitalizing such titles for a while, and it was fun to reminisce about that period with this DVD.",1450828800,,920,5.244897959183674

8561710,4,B00B2TU47C,"This 4-episode OVA series was an adaptation of the Venger Robo manga that was released in English through Viz Manga. The anime was one of several to use the term Shin among the Getter Robo titles like the New Getter Robo TV series, or the Getter Robo: Armageddon OVA, although technically they're not all in the same fictional universe. This particular OVA actually took the mecha from Getter Robo: Armageddom and Getter Robo Go into the same reality, but meant to be a follow up to the original Getter Robo and Getter Robo G(or Starvengers in America)shows from the 70s. Although, like most of the other Getter Robo anime movies that had the word ""Vs."" in the title, the two title characters don't actually fight in it.

 The main enemy from the first Getter Robo anime series, the Dinosaur Empire, returns years after an all-out invasion on New York failed, which also claimed the original Getter Robo mecha and it's pilot Mushashi in its aftermath. The reptiliain humanoids plan their next invasion more carefully as the world forces muster to put together a new team to pilot their newest giant robot, Neo Getter Robo. Once they finally assemble all three pilots, the Neo Getter Team joins forces with the American mecha, Texas Mack, and its badass charismatic cowboy pilots. Eventually though, Neo Getter Robo gets trashed, and the team starts up the even more powerful Shin Getter Robo to foil the Dinosaur Empire's ultimate plan of using a giant flying sauce to dominate the world.

 All in all, this was a pretty satisfying OVA. It didn't go on for too much longer like Getter Robo Armageddon did at some points, and carried the passing of the torch for a new generation of Getter pilots while still giving the old school team enough to do. The animation is decent, but mostly in the thrilling mecha fights that make Pacific Rim look like a puppet show. This is available through Discotek Media on subtitled DVD, although an added dub would've been nice.",1412899200,3,1962,4.761764705882353
8561711,3,B00B2TU47C,"This was done back in 2000, but is finally seeing a U.S. 2013 release.  This OVA adapts more from the manga and not from Go Nagai's animation efforts.  You'll see Getter Robo, in the beginning.  You'll then see Neo Getter Robo, and then see why Shin Getter Robo has to be used.  Also, Shin Getter Robo VS Neo Getter Robo is not set in the Getter Robo anime continuity.

If you've watched any unedited Getter Robo anime, then you know that it's an instant PG-13 rating.  Like any of the Mazinger animes or the unedited Go Lion anime, the battle scenes are pretty violent and graphic.  The only tame parts of the battles are when the Getter Robo prototypes are melted down.

I found the incorporation of Jack King and Mary King, who pilot Texas Mack and Hat Machine quite annoying!  It must be funny to a Japanese person to hear a mix of English with Japanese, but I found the English-Japanese speaking unbearable to listen to!  You might was well blank out their speaking parts and just watch the subtitles.

I'm not sure what direction Shin Getter Robo VS Neo Getter Robo was trying to do.  I think there are too many concepts and ideas introduced in this OVA, where I think the pacing and setup would have been much better in an anime series.  This OVA, I think, is a big disappointment to this Getter Robo fan.",1364774400,5,1312,4.439330543933054
8561712,3,B00B2TU47C,"Five years ago, the Getter Robo put to rest the evil plans of the Dinosaur Empire. Now, they've returned and a new team is formed to fight them. But, is it enough? Or will a weapon from the past be mankind's biggest chance for survival.

Shin Getter Robo vs. Neo Getter Robo is the second of three OVAs made based on the Getter Robo franchise (following Getter Robo Armageddon and followed by New Getter Robo), but it wasn't until recently that the series finally crossed over to the States, giving everyone a chance to see all three OVAs based off of the first combining giant robot. The series is amazingly short - 4 30-minute episodes compared to the 13 in Armageddon and New. Thus, the series blazes across all of its major points in record time - introducing the first titular robot (Neo Getter), introducing the ham-tacular Jack King (and his sister, Mary, and their robot, the Texas Mack), bringing in the second titular robot (Shin Getter), and the big final battle. If you were looking for something more to the story, this one isn't it. If you're looking for mindless fun, give it a try.

The DVD is, sadly, incredibly BARE. It's just the episodes and the subtitles. They don't include any ads for any of Discotek's other videos and, sadly, the three shorts starring creator Go Nagai's legendary super robots (from the Mazinger-Z to Mazinkaiser) is not included in this as well, as it was this series was what introduced them (and lead to the Mazinkaiser OVA series a year or so later).

Again, if you're looking for some mindless fun, go for it. If not, maybe it's time to go poke Discotek and tell them to give you that TOO MUCH HIGH POWER!",1364169600,7,1652,4.574324324324325
