8211855,4,B000U1WGPG,"I was not willing to spend not only $40 on this Antique VHS, but the hundreds of dollars i would have to spend on a VCR to play the video...So i watched this movie on YouTube.  This was a great movie and very inspirational.  It reminded me of how much I love the modern era of Brazilian wax jobs!",1404950400,,296,4.0
8211856,5,B000U1WGPG,"What could be better than an old campy movie with Chuck Conners as the evil sheriff, the Brady Bunch dad (Robert Reed) playing a sex-crazed prison warden, Tina Louise (Ginger from Gilligan's Island) as a sadistic prison guard, Fionnuala Flanagan as a prison guard with a heart and a crush on Deborah Raffin, who's unjustly imprison with Lynn Moody on a southern prison farm. Toss in murderess inmate Della Reese who knows all and sees all, and...well, it doesn't get any better than Nightmare in Badham County.

Here's a little secret. Shop for the DVD called ""20 Action Movies"". Buried on that inexpensive movie disc is Nightmare in Badham County. The DVDs are selling for slightly over $10.",1389225600,,692,4.864406779661017
8211857,5,B000U1WGPG,I was expecting a junky TV movie but was stunned at how well this film is made. It is not an easy watch and felt real from start to finish. Robert Reed is a stand out as corrupt county farm warden but ALL the acting is amazing. You won't recognize Tina Louise who is an amazingy underrated actress! This film is not for kids or young teens. Ending is not Hollywood Disney.,1387843200,,372,4.180555555555555
