8325296,5,B000KFV4A0,"I picked up a copy of this video tape years ago at the Portland, Maine airport.  I played it for hours as I worked on my dissertation.  It's not a box office smash or anything.  Just a pleasant distraction with pleasant music and few conversations.  There will soon be a recognized genre of videos to ""watch"" while working -- to keep you on task, and to make tedious work a little more pleasant.  This one takes you to New England for just a very calming hour and a half.  I wore through the tape long ago, and now I'm on the DVD as I write books.

I could not recommend it more for writers and others who need a little something going on to stay on task. Or for those who want a preview of New England before traveling there, or for others who perhaps cannot go as often as they'd like.",1352937600,3,787,4.1381578947368425
