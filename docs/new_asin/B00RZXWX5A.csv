6937672,3,B00RZXWX5A,"Well, don't be deceived by the cover art and labels. The motion comic part has very little motion, except for a few stock loops reused endless times
to simulate motion . Most monotonous, the story line is okay but underdeveloped. Hence an average rating. With some development, and some effort to produce more fluid and meaningful artwork  there is some potential to be a production worth having.",1433289600,4,396,4.91044776119403

6937693,3,B00RZXWX5A,I don't really know how to feel about this movie. It was interesting. I kinda got into it. I feel like you are learning the plot as the characters do...so that can be confusing. But otherwise it's pretty good. I would watch the next volume.,1472860800,,240,4.355555555555555

6937742,5,B00RZXWX5A,What I love about it is that it's an actual motion comic - from the comic itself. Not something that was made that doesn't actually exist in comic form. Music is great.,1462406400,,168,4.28125
6937743,3,B00RZXWX5A,"Weird, fun, and kind of dumb. Overall, an enjoyable experience.",1462060800,,63,5.4

6937754,2,B00RZXWX5A,"Well, I just couldn't get into this one. The animation style is, what they could afford I guess. The story didn't grab me, and it didn't evolve fast enough.

8696586,1,B00RZXWX5A,"It's essentially machinima..
A bunch of story board stills where the director utilizes digital key framing to pan all over the shot, sometimes it seems like it's being done because they can not because it adds to the story or brings attention to a focal point.

All the money was spent on the still shots and the voice acting there isn't a single bit of animation in this whatsoever.",1533081600,,383,4.550724637681159
