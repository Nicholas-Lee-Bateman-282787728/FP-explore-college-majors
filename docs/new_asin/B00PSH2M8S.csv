8689078,3,B00PSH2M8S,"OK typical, somewhat tepid British mystery thriller.  A young American comes to a British rest home/resort to rest, I guess.  In reality he is a doctor traveling incognito because he wants to find out what happened to his ex-wife.  It seems she died under mysterious circumstances while married to a local doctor who lost two previous wives in similarly strange conditions.  The local Brits are so laid back they see nothing strange about the un-merry widower.  Not as good as some far better mysteries, such as Kill or Cure or the Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple films.  The 20th-Century Fox Cinema Archives DVD-R release is pristine quality.  The black-and-white photography is crisp and clear.  Not bad but not great.",1436659200,,720,5.0423728813559325
