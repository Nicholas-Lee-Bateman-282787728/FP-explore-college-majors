6425292,3,B00KGI2XXS,"Carl Lindbergh is back with ""The Bunnyman Massacre"" (2014), his second entry in his ""Bunnyman"" franchise; and I understand that a third one is in the works. This one is a low budget fusion of ""Motel Hell"" (1980) and ""Kiss & Tell"" (1997); and yet another homage to the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974). Unfortunately, none of the female cast is remotely in the sexploitation class of ""Motel Hell's"" Monique St. Pierre or ""Kiss & Tells"" Heather Graham  in other words no viewer will be at the edge of his seat hoping to see any of them take off their tops.

Unlike Pamela Gidley's murderous ""Beta Carotene"" character in ""Kiss & Tell"", this bunny is (once again) in an actual rabbit costume with a happy face, the kind of costume commonly seen at a community Easter Egg Hunt. The incongruity gives Lindbergh tons of visual juxtapostioning opportunities, the inspiration and entire basis for the ""Bunnyman"" franchise.

Lindbergh seems to have taken some time to write a very humorous 26-minute black comedy segment, pitched it to some financial backers, and then shot the first one fourth of his film. During this segment the title character breaks movie conventions by attacking a school bus of children on a rural road and then eats dinner with his associate Joe. We learn (during a Mad Hatter inspired dinner scene) that Bunnyman's rage comes from his frustration at being required to stay a vegetarian, because bunnies don't eat meat.

After 26 minutes you are convinced that Lindbergh has a winner here, with it shaping up into the most original black comedy treatment the genre has ever seen. All he has to do is maintain the tension and suspense, which he could easily do by alternating quick kills and unexpected escapes, using a little misdirection to make it impossible for viewers to sort out targets from non-targets.

But by the 30 minute mark you realize that he has already shot his bolt in the initial segments and has simply cobbled together and tacked on sixty minutes of listless moronic filler to get his film up to feature length. The only exception being an inspired sequence of barrel rolling  the best of which involves emptying the barrel for reuse.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1405468800,4,2226,4.81151832460733

6425321,4,B00KGI2XXS,"Bunnyman Massacre is one of those rare gems that you find in a stack of terrible horror movies. The film is about a group of female campers who are being tormented by 2 deranged killers and must play their mind games to getaway.

The film starts out with a school bus full of children and the bus driver stops to pick up a child at the bus stop and at this point, you already know something is very unsettling. The film then picks up immediately without starting with the title or credits. Throughout the entire movie, you can feel like something bad is going to happen but you really don't know what. The 2 killers play an excellent role and really mess with the victims heads. You can also connect with the female characters in the film and the pain they go through in the movie. It may also seem funny that someone is running around in a bunny suit, but not only do they explain why but once you watch the film, you can help but feel a little creep out. The ending to the film will also surprise you.

I'm giving this movie 4 stars in my opinion. To me, it's hard to find a good horror movie with all these other modern day horror movies about a group of Campers, College Kids or Teenagers being chased by a killer, it brings back the classic horror feeling of not knowing what will happen/being afraid of the killers, it has a great story and does not disappoint!

I would recommend this movie to any horror fans looking for a good horror film.",1470700800,,1448,4.2967032967032965

6425325,3,B00KGI2XXS,"I think film viewers have grown to be rightfully wary of anything resembling ""based on actual events"" or however it's worded. There's an urban legend with some potential fact behind it about a bunnysuit-clad killer, but this film is pretty much just low budget fiction. It doesn't have much of a plot except for new victims for the Bunnyman, and it's quite misogynistic and extreme. I think the director was going for a kind of Eli Roth experience, but this film falls short. By the film's end, a bunnysuited killer chasing scantily clad women grows a little thin. There's also a torture porn element to this film, but it isn't paced very well nor very substantive or meaningful. This film is pretty much grisly death after grisly death, with arty sequences of quivering trees and the moon rising interspersed. That's about it, in addition to some darkly funny dialogue and one of the worst pair of fake boobs you'll ever see. I gave it 3 stars because I was in a crappy mood and seeing a man in a bunny costume senselessly hunt people was what I needed in that moment. But you can only get so much mileage out of a man in a bunny suit chasing people in the wilderness; after awhile the horse is dead and flogged. This film is also not to be confused with the title of its predecessor when released in the UK; yes, it's confusing. I rented this film for 99 cents and its was worth it, but I wouldn't say it's worth much more than that, though I actually would check out Bunnyman (1) and the upcoming Bunnyman 3, which I haven't seen yet, just for the fun of it. Sometimes you just need torture porn junk food.",1446508800,2,1609,4.4391891891891895
6425326,3,B00KGI2XXS,"The story follows Joe and the Bunnyman as they continue their ploy of carnage, adding to their body count in a small rural community hanging on the outskirts of a ghost town. It is a very simple concept with no real depth, which basically puts females and the occasional male in the psycho killers path for a visceral, bloody death. The Bunnyman Massacre doesnt really focus much on dialog, just quick quips and profane banter that creates the cruel personas of Joe and the Bunnyman. It works for the purpose of gritty, grindhouse horror, but the writing is two-dimensional and gives us no real protagonist to root for through most of the film.

Now as far as special effects are concerned, The Bunnyman Massacre continues the raw, gorefest that the first film provided. There are a couple of moments when CGI blood is added to the kills for splatter, however it seems acceptable because there is still plenty of practical fluid drenching the screen and victim. Creative angles and gimmicks make most of the kill scenes work well with minimal flaw. That is crucial for this film because with the lack of real story or heart shown in The Bunnyman Massacre you need some clean, kill effects that are organic and visceral.

The sound effects and soundtrack are your expected, atmospheric redundancy that can be heard in any number of horror films, both classic and modern. Some of the sound effects have been taken from other horror films. Not sure if it works as tribute or rip-off in The Bunnyman Massacre, the creepy sound effects work here but they are reminiscent of other classics. The soundtrack overall fails to create any real suspense or chill factor in the film, but that just adds to the fact that the story is emotionally devoid and the point-of-view is that of the killers.",1431129600,,1784,4.751612903225807

6425336,3,B00KGI2XXS,"Who hasn't ever wanted to run through a bus full of kids with a chainsaw while wearing a bunny suit? Although this doesn't seem to be an issue. The two missing deputies is the problem. Okay some bad plot issues.

Joe (David Scott) and the Bunnyman (Joshua Lang) live on a remote California ranch which borders on the desert. They get a lot of young female hikers coming through their way which get killed in various ways, a bit reminiscent of ""2,000 Maniacs."" Folks drive by for the ""REFRSHMANTS"" [sic] and home made jerky at Joe's General store located under the Audie Murphy Hotel. About half way through Bunnyman removes the mask.

One couple wanted directions to I-95 which is on the east coast. Most likely they wanted route 95 and flubbed the line. This is a 90's style mindless blood slasher film. It is entertaining in that regard, but lacks depth. Women, chain saw, drills, and a couple of country folk. TCM stuff.

F-bomb, sex, nudity, near sexual assault.",1414281600,,966,4.670588235294118

Most of the abysmal effects were just  blood thrown or smeared on the victims and they don't even have wounds. Boring and tedious ,not even cheesy enough to rate camp appeal.

It wasn't even formulaic just  boring and mundane. The acting,well let's just say it was laughable and not in a good way. I could have possibly have  gotten into it if the effects weren't tired and done in the lamest way possible but I'm not even sure if that would have saved it.",1411344000,2,541,4.38
6425339,3,B00KGI2XXS,"Ever watch a movie and be stuck between the emotions of ""meh"" and yelling at your T.V. because of stupid character actions? Well if you haven't you'll get your chance multiple times over with Bunnyman Massacre. I'm pretty sure this is a sequel, but you don't need to have seen the first movie for this one to work for you. There are a couple very small flashback scenes, and one mention of bunnymans family from the first film, but you don't need to find the first film to enjoy this one.

This film starts out with a bang literally, as bunnyman (Joshua Lang) blows off a school bus drivers head en route to slaughtering a busload of children with a chainsaw. A horrifying as this sounds, it's actually darkly humorous. Very black hard humor. Most of the movie plays this way, but this first scene works best in the entire film. One thing that bugged me here. Please for the love of God people, STOP with the fake CGI blood. While I understand that you want to make your film as gory as possible, using CGI spurts and splatters just takes the viewer out of the moment. Either use real fake blood (there was enough of it on hand throughout the film), or don't use anything and let people use their imagination (Which usually conjures up much worse images than showing that crappy fake blood splatter, just reference the Texas Chainsaw Massacre for examples). Joe (David Scott) is Bunnymans keeper, or father figure, or something like that. He is the true epitome of southern hick with a shotgun. Most of the film consists of bunnyman stalking and killing female campers, or bringing them back for him and Joe to torture and kill. This is where the film falls flat into formula. Women doing stupid things that make you yell at the screen for them just to run away, yet they continue to hang around and do stupid things long enough to get themselves killed. It's hard to feel much empathy for any of the characters at all. The only two who have any sort of back-story at all are two sisters who are captured early on. They have lost both of their parent earlier in life, so they are both protective of each other. So much so, that one sister agrees to a deal with Joe to capture and bring back three women for him in exchange for the sisters freedom. Joe agrees, but things don't turn out to well, as can be imagined. There is very little originality that shines through in the film. Bunnyman himself is kind of creepy, wearing the mask and suit the entire running time of the film except for one brief reveal of his face. The black humor is a little refreshing in todays world of grueling torture marathons, and the ""Inspired by True Events"" tag on the DVD cover is interesting as well.

Bunnyman Massacre is shot in 1.85:1 and looks great on television, as a new movie should. Sound is in 5.1 Dolby Stereo and can be loud enough at times to adjust the volume accordingly. Special features include an Audio Commentary, Behind The Scenes Featurette, Deleted Scenes, Interviews, Bunnyman Gets Fast Food & Joe's Guide To Dating. A lot of the features are pretty funny, and add some insight to the films creation. Now should you pick this one up? Well, there's worse ways to kill 90 minutes. Remember though that this is a sequel, and if you want to get the full Bunnyman experience, you need to get and watch the first film before delving into this one. You might have a better idea after that if this sequel is up your alley or not.",1410307200,,3428,4.4832
6425340,4,B00KGI2XXS,"I watch dozens of horror movies every month, and the first time I watched this it instantly jumped into my memory as on the better horror films I've seen this year. Yeah, it got all the trappings of a low budget horror movie, no name actors and limited locations but the movie makes up for it in it's creativity.

Everything from the ensemble cast to the story, characters, humor, gore and effects are TOP NOTCH. You can tell while watching it that the filmmakers truly had a passion for what they were making and had fun making it, which is hard to say about most films.

If you're an overly sensitive, easily offended, weak stomached person with a fear of having your sensibilities challenged stay away -- But if you're like me and enjoy a well made, fun, unique, over the top film this is the one you've been waiting for a long, long time.

8658436,4,B00KGI2XXS,"Whoa!  The Bunnyman Massacre is exactly what a slasher is supposed to be!  Almost textbook baby!  You can tell it's going to be intense right in the beginning when we see a school bus pull up to a bench with a little girl waiting to get on.  When the bus stops... the driver looks at the girl and... she falls over.  She was slashed to death by the Bunnyman!  The bus driver makes a foolish mistake by turning her head the wrong way enabling the Bunnyman to stick his chainsaw right through the windshield and slices her neck!  All the kids run to the emergency exit but the Bunnyman invites himself in and slices his way through chopping them up.  Many of the kids jump to freedom however.  Who knows what happened to them.  Warning, my review contains a bunch of SPOILERS!

The Bunnyman loves his chainsaw quite a lot!  But he also doesn't mind taking out an ax and chopping people's necks.  There's also a store owner named Joe who works with the Bunnyman.  The story never says how this man relates to the Bunnyman but we can assume the two go way back.  Perhaps he's a brother or someone who encouraged the Bunnyman to take out their revenge on innocent people because somebody somewhere did them both wrong.  And speaking of innocent people, that brings us to our story!

While a man and woman are making out in a tent the Bunnyman rips open the tent and kills them.  That's how it goes isn't it?  You can't make love in a forest and expect to get away with it!  He also kills another woman who was just minding her business sleeping.  Later in the day when the Bunnyman sees a group of female hitchhikers walking around, well, that's a perfect opportunity to track them down and cut 'em up don't you think?  Yup! The woman who falls to her knees allowing the Bunnyman a few seconds to decide what to do, and ultimately deciding on chainsawing her neck, was an awesome moment!  The poor girl didn't have time to defend herself.

But the main chunk of the story is when two sisters walk into Joe's convenience store and criticize it.  Joe takes exception and tells the girls they ain't goin' anywhere as they try to leave.  No way!  He'll shoot 'em down if they try to run.  He takes the girls back to his barn and ropes them down.  The one sister who is desperate and doesn't want to see her sister being tormented and raped says she knows where four more women are located, and if Joe lets her go she'll bring them back to the barn.  Joe goes along with it.  He cuts her loose and... wow.  She really made the wrong decision in my opinion.

Since Joe mentions it takes an hour to get to the police station if she tries to run for it, I figured the sister would actually take the girls and they'd all run as fast as they can to the police station leaving the one girl behind (it's one girl's life versus three after all)... but instead the sister arrives to their camp site and demands the three girls go with her right away.  She even pulls a gun and makes them go.  Wow, she's willing to exchange three lives for one just because the one is her sister, and after a family tragedy she doesn't want to lose her too.  Anyway she brings the girls to the barn for Joe and the Bunnyman to have tormenting fun with.  The sisters have a great, meaningful conversation after Joe and the Bunnyman set the two free if the sister made the right choice.  The one sister says ""You shouldn't have brought those three girls here just for me!"" but the other defends her actions saying ""But you're my sister and the only family I have left!""  It's a really good moment for sure.

D'oh!  That's the sound Homer would make when the sisters are seen walking down the road... allowing the Bunnyman to simply drive up to them and kidnap them.  Wow, at least run away as fast as possible in the nearby woods or something and hope you arrive to the police station by morning!  It's not like they were too injured to run at this point.  Anyway Joe and the Bunnyman have lots of fun with the three kidnapped girls.  Joe asks them to pick a number.  The girl who draws lucky number 2 is taken to a mountain and thrown in a barrel as Joe drills big screws into the side of the barrel.  I actually didn't notice what was going on here.  I thought the girl was lucky that the screws kept missing her body but... naive me strikes again!  Joe kicks the barrel down the cliff which means the girl's rolling around in the screws... and turns into a bloody mess!  After she hits a rock the lid pops off and her bloody body pops out.  Too bad that lid didn't pop off during the roll.  If that had happened her life might've been spared.  Well for a few seconds anyway.  It's not like she was running far.

Oh but the next two girls get a treat too!  The first one begs to be released.  Joe complies.  As for the other girl, she tries to pay Joe money for her freedom but she only has 100 bucks and that ain't enough to do anything.  Lots of sexual and period jokes going on here.  Too inappropriate to share!  I also admit I laughed at the child molester joke earlier when Joe and the Bunnyman were eating dinner in the barn.  Anyway, she also convinces Joe to release her  since they're going to have a little game called ""Can you outrun Joe and his gun?""

As for the first girl who was set free, she makes a foolish decision similar to the two sisters who forgot to tuck themselves in the woods after they were set free.  She encounters the Bunnyman chopping wood and runs to a nearby empty trailer.  All that space to run free wasted!  The Bunnyman hears this, kidnaps her, and takes her to a building where he uses a drill to cut her eye out.  Meanwhile the other girl Joe sets free opens the door BEFORE her friend has her eye drilled out but does nothing to stop it.  WHAT?  She just tucks behind the counter watching her friend's eye get drilled out!  I could've sworn she'd smack the Bunnyman with something.  But no, I guess she liked it.  It's a shame too because the girl was clearly more scared than the others and deserved to live more.

Another odd moment happens when the girl hiding behind the counter after this.  She's hanging in the barn roped and tied with the two sister.  She breaks free and tries to run away but she's shot in the leg by Joe.  What's odd about this scene is when the Bunnyman approaches her and she hears a voice say ""It's going to be okay"".  Uh no!  Because a moment later the Bunnyman runs his chainsaw through her chest putting blood everywhere.  We find out later that ""It's going to be okay"" voice was the Bunnyman hearing it, not the girl.  Fooled me!

The way the two sisters die is... well one of the deaths is weak but the other's pretty good.  When Joe and the sheriff have a showdown and the cop loses, he has his eyes ripped out but manages to shoot Joe in the neck so the Bunnyman can finish Joe off.  Perhaps the Bunnyman was tired of all the criticisms Joe kept throwing his way.  Before this however the cop tells the two sisters to hide in his truck so he can run into the woods to finish off the killers.  He tells the girls there's a gun they can use, but a moment later the Bunnyman grabs the one sister and bashes her into the side of the cop's truck and she dies.  The other sister walks too close to the Bunnyman and he slaps the gun away from her and punches her out.  When she wakes up and sees her dead sister she pulls the trigger and ends her own life.  The Bunnyman lives on!

I wasn't sure during the conversations between Joe and the Bunnyman early on if the Bunnyman was a man wearing a costume or an actual human-shaped bunny.  Hey the writing *did* show the Bunnyman obsessed with caged rabbits so the thought crossed my mind he might be some kind of rabbit himself.  He's not though.

I highly recommend this movie. It's nonstop blood and guts for your pleasure.",1500336000,,7808,4.281314168377824
