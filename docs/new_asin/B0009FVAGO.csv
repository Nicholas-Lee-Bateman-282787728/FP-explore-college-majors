8060089,5,B0009FVAGO,I really enjoyed watching this. I knew that it took a lot to produce a concert tour but I have a totally new respect for what it takes. Just amazing and the concert footage at the end it great! I have watched it several times now.,1374105600,2,230,4.021739130434782

8060092,5,B0009FVAGO,"A phenomenal record of an 80's arena tour. Kind of a guilty pleasure that I rented from an obscure, now defunct, video store a long time ago. Having recently become interested once again in classic rock, I found it on line. Interesting thing is that this documentary was made by NFL films; I don't know if they ever did anything else like it. The quality is superb, as their products always are. And now it's a bit of an historic record of the band and its time. My entire family, from 6-year-old to 60-year-old, sat in our darkened living room Christmas night and watched it. Brought back many, many good memories. Includes live performances of many of Journey's best songs. And if you loved the videos for ""Faithfully"" and ""Send Her my Love,"" you'll recognize the footage.",1234742400,3,774,4.656934306569343
8060093,5,B0009FVAGO,"This is a must have for any Journey fan.  There are sections that can tend to be a bit boring if you are not into watching roadies build a stage (maybe 20 to 30 minutes).  But you must remember that Journey's stage was state of the art back then and they were pioneers in the areas of lighting, video screens, etc. for live concerts.  For the most part, however, it's a backstage glimpse into Journey on the road during the Frontiers tour.  If I remember correctly you could only get this VHS tape through their fan club (that's where I got mine in 1984 when I was all of 16 years old).  Probably why it's so expensive now (I paid like $15 for mine back in the day).  I watched it over and over again - especially the final 45 minutes or so - the actual concert footage filmed during one of three sold out shows in Philadelphia.  There is also some great footage of the band in concert back in the 70's and discussions of how certain songs (like Faithfully) were written.  This video was produced by the same guys who do all the NFL films.  It's over 2 hours of great fun - a must have!!!  Oh, I just watched my Journey Greatest Hits DVD and was reminded of something.  The videos for ""Faithfully"" and ""Send Her My Love"" were taken directly from the Frontiers and Beyond video tape.  So that should give you a good idea of some of the footage you will see on the tape.",1194134400,7,1368,4.219230769230769
8060094,5,B0009FVAGO,"Follows the band's 1983 tour from conception in San Francisco, construction in Seattle, and then across the country to the East Coast. Specific detail of the inner-workings of stage, sound,lighting and what it takes to put it all together night after night or day after day as the tour moves to outdoor venues. Life on the road for concert crew and band members without the drugs and sex... only Rock & Roll.  Concludes with a performance of 12 (or so) songs for the most part from Frontiers and Escape.  A must for would-be musicians and those who pine for the business of Rock & Roll. Journey fans will appreciate this one too",1146873600,11,628,4.598214285714286
