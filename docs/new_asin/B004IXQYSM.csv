4389376,5,B004IXQYSM,"One of the great films of 2010 is one that more than likely you haven't heard of.. It is in Spanish and its Mexican made and produced with mostly Mexican actors. It won the 2011 Ariel Award in Mexico. Opened to critical acclaim for its dark and bloody yet comedic treatment of the situation in Mexico in 2010. The year of its dual centennial: 100 years since the Second Mexican Revolution and 200 years since the first. Like the graphics say in the trailer: Nada que celebrar. Nothing to celebrate.

El Infierno opens with a classic scene that many will relate to. Many have lived this scene. Benny Garcia is receiving a blessing from his mother before he leaves on his journey to El Norte, or Gringolandia as it is called. He promises to send back money He strides up the dusty road from the ranchito with the palm frond porch as his mother and little brother watch sadly. During his absence the little brother will become a famous killer known as ""El Diablo"".

Next scene is 20 years later, and Benny is being deported. He has a little money and has learned a good bit of English during his stay. You can see the mixed emotions on his face as Los Lobos sing Yo soy de raza de oro, Yo soy Mexican Americano. He's somewhat relieved to be going home again. How bad could it be? The answer is very, very bad

Highway robbery, both official and civilian, assassinations. What should be decent people, now stooping to rob the dead. The stage is set. Now the story unfolds.

Beautifully shot and scripted, the comedy and tragedy both take wing. Everyone loses in the end, and in the end the old ways are carried on with a new generation. Bennies brother had become a famous narco and assassin in town. He ended up with 60 bullets from guns of an unknown enemy. Of which there were legion.

The regional cartel boss controls with an iron fist the police and political structure of the region. He's kind of a Mexican boss hog from the old Dukes of Hazard Show, except that he is filthy rich from drug money and assorted criminal enterprise, and also will kill at the drop of a hat. He's also overly emotional and hen-pecked. So ridiculous it could well be real life.

The film works on many levels. Murder, mayhem, mutilation and a sense of ever present doom would seem to be a poor prescription for comedy. But somehow Director Luis Estrada makes it work. All the elements of Mexican society have been compromised and there is little left to have faith in. ""El Benny"" as Benjamin Garcia the returning migrant is known, becomes a narco-killer and enforcer, but in the end makes perhaps, a noble gesture in a cathartic massacre of the corrupt power structure of Mexico.

The acting is first rate. The parts of ""El Benny"" and ""El Coci Loco"" are done to comic perfection. They might have become killers and soldiers in a filthy, depressing war; still the audience retains a connection to their humanity.

As far as the drug war that puts billions, perhaps trillions, in the pockets of gangsters and banksters, politicians, police and governments, no solutions are in sight. The corruption works on all levels. El Infierno offers none. As ""El Coci says: In Mexico you don't do what you want, only what you can""

Note: The release in Mexico of ""El Infierno"" was somewhat spotty and as far as I know it wasn't released theatrically, but is available on DVD. However there are no English subtitles. If you speak some Spanish you should be able to follow the action.",1303430400,5,3451,4.5621970920840065
4389377,5,B004IXQYSM,"La pelcula El Infierno trata de la situacin actual que se vive en el Pas en general, sobre todo en el norte. El narcotrfico parece ser la nica fuente de empleo de gente sin preparacin alguna y con la inmensa necesidad y desesperacin de llevar dinero a su casa. Una de las fuentes de empleo es irse de mojados a Estados Unidos, lo que se ha puesto cada da ms difcil.

Entre las situaciones que deben resaltarse en la intervencin de las propias autoridades encargadas de impartir justicia involucrados en el mismo negocio.

Excelentes actuaciones tanto de Damin Alczar as como de Joaqun Cosio, no se diga por supuesto de Ernesto Gmez Cruz como Don Jos Reyes, Mara Rojo como Doa Mari Reyes, Elizabeth Cervantes como la Cuada; actuacin especial de Daniel Gimnez Cacho como Capitn Ramrez; Jorge Zrate como el Huasteco, Salvador Snchez como el Padrino del Benny; Angelina Pelez como la Mam del Benny; Kristyan Ferrer como el Sobrino del Benny; Dagobero Gama como el Sargento; Mauricio Isaac como el JR; Emilio Guerrero como el Alcalde; Alejandro Calva como el Jefe de la Polica; Silverio Palacios como Cucaracha; Actuacin especial de Mario Almada como el Texano; Isela Vega como Doa Rosaura y Daniel Martnez como el Oficial Mendoza entre otros.

4389378,5,B004IXQYSM,"This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen, and it actually shows how Mexico really is right now. I'm from Mexico so I understand how crazy things are over there I visit a lot. Also the actors are great I have nothing bad to say about this film. Great job Luis Estrada.

4389379,4,B004IXQYSM,"This is a great piece of Mxico Narco's life today...
With some exaggerate archetypes on the Character profiles... But what movie doesn't !?!?!?

Estrada's Inferno is by far a neat picture full of ""Mexican  South the Border Folklore""...

Also take a look into Luis Estrada's La Ley de Herodes (2000) (Herod's Law).
It's just the neccesary amount of information to come closer to Mexico's ideology.",1293580800,5,396,5.061538461538461
4389380,5,B004IXQYSM,"This is quite possibly one of the best Mexican movies I've ever seen.  It not only gives an inside look into the merciless and soulless world of the Mexican narco, but it also gives a poignant insight into the causes for the violence: poverty, desperation, debt, lack of role-models, corruption, family feuds, etc.  The ending is a bit unrrealistic, but otherwise the movie used the best of the Mexican acting world (the main character is Lord Sopespian from chronicles of Narnia) to create an amazingly directed film.

The movie does a great job of depicting the bleak conditions of the town of San Miguel... and the horrifying reality of the narco world.  I wanted to give 4 stars for the ending (usually, movies like these shouldn't have 'happy' endings) but the movie was so good I'm going to overlook this major factor and give it 5 stars.",1293321600,13,844,4.72108843537415

Its in spanish but has english subtitles, it was perfect for me since I am a student trying to learn spanish, it gives me more practice listening to the language in 'real time'.

4389413,5,B004IXQYSM,"One of the best movies I've seen this year.

I used to live near the U.S./Mexican border in Arizona, and although this is a black comedy, it's very black and essentially accurate in depicting the conditions of the corrupt narco state that is northern Mexico.

Great characters, expertly filmed, a well-plotted story - even the music is exceptional.  I'm looking forward to seeing more movies from director Luis Estrada.  One caveat: It's extremely violent, which doesn't bother me (in fact, it's appropriate to the subject matter), but this could turn off some viewers.",1389225600,4,569,5.086021505376344

4389420,5,B004IXQYSM,"It lived up to the great reviews 100%.  Excellent performances by the actors, and it left a few very memorable characters etched into my mind.  In particular El Cochiloco, and the Mafioso Jefe's wife.  I can still hear her rant away in such a ridiculous manner causing me to laugh time and time again.  Basically the movie is a satire or black comedy about the corrupt state of Mexico's government.  We all know this omnipresent rottenness makes ripe fruit for picking and enjoying a laugh about.  What makes this movie so special is that in it's satire, it captures a lot of realism.  Struggles over wealth, jealousy, vengeance, control, etc.  These are things we can relate to, and thus we are sympathetic to how the protaganist feels at crucial points within the story.  Well executed.  In particular this movie would be very relevant to people living in the southern border states, as the movie takes place in Northern Mexico near the USA.  Be sure to buy the English subtitled version unless your Spanish is 100% native speaker-level fluent.  By the way, the actress playing the widowed sister-in-law is way hot.  I love her!!!!",1379376000,10,1133,4.808290155440415

4389423,4,B004IXQYSM,"El Infierno is set in 2010 Mexico and focuses on the country's drug war crisis. Damian Alcazar skillfully portrays Benny Garcia, sort of a good-guy-who-goes-very-bad type. But Benny somehow remains likeable to the end, despite the kind of almost casual but brutal violence in which he engages. Benny has a weak stomach for all the bloodshed, but he does like the ""fringes"":  women (including his younger brother's widow) and thick wads of cash.

You see, Benny left Mexico as a young man, bound for the U.S. He vowed to return to pick up his younger brother. Well, Benny does return--but it's twenty years later and he's broke and without prospects. It seems the only growth industry around Benny's hometown involves the spilling of blood and the selling of drugs. Benny signs up.

The acting was very strong and the cinematography captures the kind of desperate poverty that fuels the proliferation of violent crime.

Some reviewers have stated that this is a comedy. If so, it's comedy of the darkest kind. I suppose it's the kind of humor that heartless people use to trivialize their horrendous acts.

One problem I had was the conclusion's sloppy attempt to quickly tie some loose ends together.",1368921600,,1200,4.920792079207921

4389438,5,B004IXQYSM,"This film is not just about how El Benny ends up working with a narco gang in Mexico, but also about how the individual characters deal with family, loyalty, and the need to prosper within the drug culture.  There really is no gratuitous violence for each character has a mission and killings are things that ""sometimes you have to do."" For me the best aspect of the film is the culture/setting where the camera does its work to bring forth the poor peoples' way of life, the furnishings in the rooms, and best of all, the dialogue. The plot moves briskly, has nothing which might be considered superfluous, and takes several unusual turns which will keep you glued to the screen. We bought this movie about 2 weeks ago and my family and I have watched it 4 times already. Good plot, interesting settings and scenery, interesting characters. This is one of those movies where in the end you wish hard that the director will do a sequel.  I highly recommend it, with FIVE STARS.",1312761600,,977,4.577142857142857
4389439,3,B004IXQYSM,"Director Luis Estrada ushered in the Novo Cine Mexicano decade late in 1999 with his master satire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Ley-de-Herodes/dp/B0000TPA56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Ley de Herodes</a>.  Star Damian Alcazar gave the performance of a lifetime, and Mexican cinema was on fire for the better part of the last decade.  But Estrada followed that with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Un-Mundo-Maravilloso/dp/B001DDBCZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Un Mundo Maravilloso</a>, a complete dud.  Perhaps political satire needs time to season before it can become relevant.  Or perhaps it simply requires a broader consensus in support of its thesis, which that film clearly lacked.  The first film provided subtlety and biting irony, but the same efforts in the second film felt more like sour grapes from a losing political party.  That brings us here, to Estrada's 2010 trilogy-completing satire, dealing now with Mexico's bicentennial and the drug war which has overwhelmed headlines there for the past few years.

To those ignorant of Mexico north of the border, this film may serve as reinforcement of their negative stereotypes about life south of the Rio Grande.  To Malinchistas south of the border, they may dismiss it as promoting silly stereotypes about their country which do not accurately reflect the real situation of the vast majority of Mexicans.  But as one Mexican reviewer astutely noted, while this film does not reflect life for the vast majority of Mexicans, it does reflect a reality for some few.  And it is a topic worthy of discussion.

Ultimately despite one's opinion of politics, a film can be judged on its quality: the acting, cinematography, script, editing, etc.  And here Estrada simply can't replicate the brilliance of La Ley de Herodes.  It's better than Un Mundo Maravilloso, but it just isn't great.  The satire is a bit too silly at the beginning, the acting never quite so sharp, and the story never nearly so compelling.  The climax smacks of Ripstein-esque artsiness.  The cast is all competent; these are some of the best actors in Mexico.  Joaquin Cosio as El Cochiloco is great, watch for his Matando Cabos pals Silverio Palacios and Tony Dalton in cameos.  The story does help one see the appeal but ultimately dark potential turns of the vida loca it attempts to satirize.  And the views of the San Luis Potosi scrublands provide an eerie but scenic setting for the story (ironically, S.L.P. is one of the most modern and developed states in Mexico).  It's all competent and entertaining, just never great.  The funny thing is that this whole presentation of the Narco lifestyle is probably as new to average Mexicans as it is to Americans.  It's a phenomenon they also see in the news but don't really know any better than we do.

Regarding this DVD, it is letterboxed and region 1&4 (plays fine on US DVD players), but has no subtitles so is for Spanish speakers only.  The slang is quite colloquial, so even non-Mexican native Spanish speakers might need to hit the replay a few times to better understand the jargon.",1311206400,,3169,5.355555555555555
