208812,5,630013718X,"I've been looking for this movie since the internet has developed! As early as I was watching movies, I was watching this one and I LOVED it. It was on tv and my mom recorded it for me (back in 85/86 maybe?), I watched it over and over. I hated putting it away when Christmas was over, but when we brought out the Christmas stuff, I HIGHLY anticipated watching this. Somewhere along the years, we lost the video and I was sooo upset. It's a movie I've always thought about and finally came across last night! I cannot wait to own it and watch it again (and again and again).",1175212800,4,574,4.2272727272727275
208813,4,630013718X,"NUTCRACKER FANTASY is weird, but once you realize that this is essentially a Japanese take on the now famous ballet, boy is it fun.  This rarely seen Japanese-American co-production eschews sugar plum fairies and candy canes, as well as Christmas trees in favor of a dark, dreamy (and, need I say it, trippy) tone.  It's almost strange to believe that this film was made by Sanrio, the folks responsible for the more light-hearted ""Hello Kitty"" franchise.  (Some ""Hello Kitty"" figures can be seen at one point of the movie!)

The plot, very loosely based on both the fabled E.T.A. Hoffman story and, to a lesser extent, Tchaikovsky's now famous ballet (snippets of the composer's famous score can be heard on the soundtrack) goes something like this:  Clara (voiced by Melissa Gilbert), a pretty doll face of a girl, receives a mysterious nutcracker from her eccentric Uncle Drosselmeyer (Christopher Lee).  Before long, our young heroine finds herself on a STRANGE (consider the emphasis on the word ""strange"" very closely) fever-induced adventure which defies explanation.  The focal point of the film is Clara helping sad King Goodwin of the Dolls (Dick Van Patten) free his daughter from the sleeping spell of a wicked two-headed rodent, Queen Morphia (Jo Anne Worley).  In the battle against Morphia and her army of mice, Goodwin's courageous guards-keeper, Franz (Roddy McDowall) is transformed into Clara's nutcracker doll.  The last act of the film involves Clara struggling to find a way to break Franz's curse while dealing with Morphia's vengeful royal (b)rat, Gar.

What makes NUTCRACKER FANTASY interesting are its puppet animation visuals.  Around the time this movie was made (1979), it was common to see stop-motion animated specials on television, most of which came from Rankin-Bass (RUDOLPH'S SHINY NEW YEAR comes to mind).  The stop-motion process is complex:  fragile puppets ranging from 6.3 to 11 inches high are shot on a miniature set one frame at a time, with animators adjusting each puppet slightly before the next shot.  Director Takeo Nakamura and his team of 150 members total spent four years working on this movie, and their efforts are fully realized with the imaginative, and sometimes strange, results we see on screen.  There are no computer-enhanced special effects in this movie; any flashy visuals are produced optically and/or through double or triple exposures.  While it looks as cuddly and innocuous as a Rankin-Bass production, young viewers may be surprised to discover that the majority of the movie is photographed in shadowy darkness.  There are some sequences, too, that border on the scary side, most of which involve Queen Morphia and her murky underworld kingdom.  The most notably scary sequence takes place at the beginning of the movie, when a mean-looking ""rag man"" stalks the night streets of Minden town, searching for wide-awake children to transform into mice.  (This sequence feels irrelevant to the actual story, although it does serve as a good warning for children who stay up late.)  At two different points of the movie, live-action ballet segments are interspersed with the puppet-motion action; this makes for a jarring shift of visuals, but in the context of this movie, which basically sets in a dream world where nothing is supposed to make sense, it somehow works in its favor.

Just as uncanny is the soundtrack that accompanies the picture.  As mentioned previously, select movements and dances from Tchaikovsky's immortal score can be heard, but the majority of the music mostly consists of Tchaikovsky-inspired compositions as well as some rather trippy 70's techno-rock synthesizers.  There are even two pop songs (out of the four in this movie) sung by Marty Gwinn and Steve Bishop which seem strangely offbeat with the fairytale-like quality of the story--one of them sounds like it could be a Beatles number!  Whether this was done for commercial reasons or to add another depth of bizarreness to the movie is unknown, but these abrupt shifts in musical styles could annoy purists expecting to hear an undistorted performance of the ballet score.  Not that the music itself isn't beautiful.  It's mostly easy on the ears and has some amusingly interesting remixes of ballet pieces.  One takes place during a quirky dance sequence involving pint-sized sprites and colorful figurines dancing in a cloud-filled kingdom to a lively hybrid of the ""March"", ""Reed Flute Dance"", and ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" dances.  It's strange, but fun.

Since the puppets in this movie were synched to the pre-recorded Japanese dialogue, there are some obvious missteps in the American dub, sync wise; some lines are either mistimed or don't match.  But the English voice cast is certainly talented and deliver credible line readings (Christopher Lee is especially brilliant--he has multiple roles in the film and even sings two songs--handsomely, too); there is even a cameo by Eva Gabor as a kindly but eccentric gypsy fortune teller dubbed the Queen of Time.  Michelle Lee, presumably a grown-up Clara, narrates the story from time to time.

NUTCRACKER FANTASY was theatrically released in America for a limited time in 1979, but ever since it has become one of those difficult to find anymore movies.  Young children might find the pace off-putting (even at 82 minutes, there are lots of slow spots) and maybe a little too eerie, yet older kids and animation buffs should find this movie to be of interest.  While its technical values aren't on par with some of today's more sophisticated stop-motion features (Tim Burton's NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and CORPSE BRIDE come to mind), it still maintains a unique look and a strangely captivating heart for its audience.  The movie itself may not be for everyone, but as an animated rarity, NUTCRACKER FANTASY might be worth checking out.",1174348800,14,5843,5.134107708553326
208814,5,630013718X,"A 15-year-old left a review saying this movie is scary and not for children.  Forgive me, but I can't help but be annoyed with that.  My sister and I have literally been watching this film quite often since the age of 3 (we are now ages 20 and 22), and I can guarentee that it is NOT frightening.  Why else would we have kept watching it?  It's an amazing fantasy story based on ""The Nutcracker and the Mouseking"", and implanted in it is an amazing love story that even adults can appreciate.  As a matter of fact, no child can watch this film and take the idea of ""love"" lightly afterwards.  Not to mention the acting is excellent, especially Christopher Lee (who plays about four or five different characters convincingly), and for a film made in 1979, the effects are very well done and suit the story perfectly.  The only thing that never seemed to quite fit was the little bit in the beginning about the ragman; it was a mini-story that basically said if children didn't go to bed on time, they'd be turned into mice.  About as frightening as ""Nanny McPhee"".  I can guarentee that this would be an excellent movie for children, especially those that love fantasy stories, and that if you find a GOOD copy of it on tape, snatch it up right away.  I can also guarentee that if it ever comes out on DVD, I'll be first in line with the best of them to nab a copy for my own children.",1151452800,7,1384,4.329457364341085

208817,4,630013718X,"This film was made in 1979 and not in the early 90's as stated by one user. The film is produce by Sanrio (for those of you not familiar they make Hello Kitty)...I use to rent this film all the time as a child, I was amazed at the beautiful stop motion puppetry.(Similiar to that of Rankin and Bass, responsible for Rudolph the Red Nose Reindear and other christmas tales). The film is told in a sort of surreal way, the main character seeming to go in and out of conscioness. There are some creepy scences (ie. the Ragman) but I think they are what make the film so intriguing. I wish they would put this one on DVD. If you haven't seen this film I highly recommend you get it, if you can get your hands on it...for it is rare.",1087776000,7,728,4.133802816901408

It has an all-star cast with Michele Lee, Melissa Gilbert, Lurene Tuttle, Christopher Lee, Jo Anne Worley, Dick Van Patten, Roddy McDowell, and Eva Gabor. It was made in the early 90's, and is a wonderful ""fairy tale romance"" for any little girl, or girl-at-heart! It has a great message of love and giving. My daughter and I watch it, and she loves it too. It has some dark moments and slightly scarry scenes, but over-all, I think it is a great family film. I wish they would re-release this on DVD!!",1069718400,8,529,4.463917525773196

208841,4,630013718X,"I kept / stole this VHS when I left the nest at 18 - eventually I became too scared to actually play it, for fear of the VHS player 'eating' the tape. It sits on my shelf, awaiting my motivation to pay someone to transfer it to dvd for me (I no longer even own a VHS player).

I adore this movie. I would give it 5 stars, but I realize that it holds a place in my heart from watching it very young that makes it better than it truly is. The stop animation is gorgeous, it has some truly scary sequences, and is overall haunting and memorable - a real gem, but one very hidden (I'm surprised when anyone else besides me has seen it). Bonus: Christopher Lee's voice. *joy*",1325721600,4,670,4.075757575757576
208842,3,630013718X,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a child at the movie theatre and it gave me nightmares - The rag man was the scary part. Some reviewers have stated that this was not scary for them and that may be true, but parents should know the capabilities of their kids.  I would recommend watching the movie first just to be on the safe side.  Looking back on it as an adult is amusing, but I was scared at the theatre.

208844,5,630013718X,My children watched this at a young age and were enthralled. They have watched it over and over and still want to watch it as adults. It is truly amazing and we wish it would come out on DVD. We think it is not at all scary. My kids who got nightmares from Alice in Wonderland never had problems with this one.

208845,5,630013718X,Why do so many of these classic 1970's era Japan crossover type cartoons and puppet animation never make it to DVD?! Still one of my all time favorites after first seeing it around 20 years ago.,1261872000,2,194,4.416666666666667
208846,5,630013718X,"How this movie has escaped a DVD release is beyond me. The way the Rankin/Bass puppet-animated titles sell like hotcakes every year - this similar looking movie should have arrived on DVD years ago. While it looks very similar in style to a Rankin/Bass Christmas special - that is where the similarities end. This movie is much darker and possibly more disturbing. However that doesn't mean it is any less enjoyable. A voice talent that boasts some of the most popular TV stars of the 70's/80's brightens up the dreamy, surreal imagery that makes up the strange wonderland that is ""The Nutcracker Fantasy"". Remaster this classic and get it out on DVD!!!",1260662400,5,653,4.839285714285714
208847,4,630013718X,"I have been watching it since I was nine years old and I find some parts in this cartoon scary,like the ragman and the two-headed queen morphia,it took me a few months to over that one. I still have that tape my mom recorded for us. But it's not all that bad. Well,you know as they say,seeing is believing. I like to see this one on DVD also just like so many other classic anime have been put on DVD.",1178496000,2,401,4.025
7803049,5,630013718X,"Wonderful film, but might scare children concerning the ""rag man"" scene (beginning of film- he only appears for a couple minutes). I never fully understood the rag man scene? He appears in the beginning of the film, but really doesn't show up again as during rest of movie. The story is about a young girl, Clara, whose uncle (voiced by Christopher Lee) is a clock maker, and he also creates dolls. Clara ends up loving his goofy looking nutcracker doll. To give an overall idea of the movie a two head queen mouse wants to destroy the doll, Clara ends up in the kingdom of the dolls. Once there she runs into the king whose daughter was put to sleep/ changed into an ugly mouse by Queen Morphia (two head mouse). A soldier named Franz fights the mice, Clara falls in love with him (weird because she looks like she is only 8 years old, and Franz is 18). AND so on.
I feel that this movie can be enjoyed for its overall odd feel. I think it is more a film for older children, teenagers, or adults to watch. If you like strange films then this could be the one for you. It is not gory, and there is no cursing in it. It is just wonderfully ODD.
I know that this was a film inspired by the Rankin and Bass Christmas Films (like Rudolph), and that is why it looks so much like their stop frame animation. However, once you start to watch it, you'll soon realize that it can carry a darker tone.
My biggest complaint is the editing. I use to watch this on VHS, and I was expecting the same overall presentation on this DVD as I had seen on the VHS. However, This DVD version does not always have the greatest editing. For example, You might see Clara standing or walking with absolutely no sound, Then the sound comes into play quickly. There is one scene where in the VHS version the song ends, the audience hears the mice squeaking, and then some music, and Clara walks down the stairs. In this version, for several seconds, as song ends, you'll hear faint mice squeaking, and then no sound, then within a few seconds, the sounds returns. So I don't know what to say about that.
Otherwise I have always loved this movie, and hope that one day it finds itself on Blueray. Also, with this movie you have the options of hearing the characters speak in  English, or Japanese with English subtiitles.

Started watching it as a family when my kids were little and watched every year till we no longer had a vhs player. Every year we have checked ti see if it was out in DVD, over 35 years and finally out in DVD! Bought it for my daughter and gave it to her for an early Christmas gift and we watched it Thanksgiving day. Put out by the Japanese company, Sanrio. Yes the company that brought out Hello Kitty and other characters. Have to say, the Japanese really know how to do it. A whole movie of dolls, bit scary for little ones, but not to scary. Came out in I believe 1981 and is amazing in its' composition. Highly recommend it, the music is great too.",1511740800,,721,4.1571428571428575
7803056,5,630013718X,"For the first time, Nutcracker Fantasy is on DVD in the US. This stop-motion animated movie has rarely been seen in the US, only getting a small release on VHS which now commands high prices. Now Discotek Media has made it far more available.

Nutcracker Fantasy is loosely based on E.T.A. Hoffman's ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King."" It wildly veers from the source material, but manages to keep the themes and tone of the original story. The packaging credits Tchaikovsky, but the movie actually uses Tchaikovsky's music as a starting point, going off in many of its own directions. Even the main song ""Dance of the Dolls"" uses no notable themes from Tchaikovsky's score.

The movie follows young Clara as she receives a special Nutcracker from her Uncle Drosselmeyer (who's voiced by Christopher Lee in the English version). After having a dream about mice attacking her, Clara has an extensive dream about entering the Doll Kingdom and discovering the curse the mouse Queen Morphia has placed on the princess. Clara helps captain Franz obtain a pearl sword to defeat Morphia, which he suceeds at, but is cursed into becoming a Nutcracker. Clara begins a quest to break the curse.

The movie is stop-motion animated by Sanrio, and the DVD presents two versions: the Japanese version and the English version. The Japanese version has English subtitles. The English version has no subtitles. The Japanese version runs about 12 minutes longer with several extended moments during many of the fantasy dance scenes.

The video quality is great for DVD. Japan has a couple Blu-Ray editions (they re-tinted the original photography and added some new CG elements and a new voice track, this version is available along with a Blu-Ray of the original Japanese version), but Discotek Media has only released a fine DVD instead. I would've preferred a Blu-Ray, but I'm glad to get this DVD over nothing. The English audio is nice and clear, but sounds a little crackly at points.

The DVD quickly opens after a few logos to a menu that lets you select which version you want to watch, which then takes you to a second main menu lets you play that version or chapter selection. The English subtitles in the Japanese version can be turned off.

This is one of my favorite Nutcracker adaptations in how it reworks Hoffman's story into something new. Definitely give it a shot now that Discotek has released it on a great new DVD.",1504137600,9,2420,4.8474576271186445
