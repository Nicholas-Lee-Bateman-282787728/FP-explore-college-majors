8033481,4,B0002VQXGM,"Baby Sitters Jitters - An excellent short in my opinion. Shemp, the practicing kleptomaniac who steals silverware and alarm clocks is a scream as is the coughing up bubbles routine thanks to Shemp loading boiling water with soap instead of soup. I know most of the stooges ""baby shorts"" get knocked by fans but this was excellent. 4 1/2 stars

Don't Throw That Knife - A good short, although a bit silly in spots, such as the knife-wielding jealous husband who shoots eggs at the stooges (WTF). Loved the why-cough routine (because he don't brush his teeth lady). 3 1/2 stars

He Cooked His Goose - A good, experimental short that cast the stooges in separate roles. Larry, the conniving lothario trying to steal Shemp and Moe's women; Moe, the jealous husband and Shemp about to be married. I liked that weird sting music that played whenever Larry would get an evil thought in that empty skull of his and Shemp's Santa routine was pretty funny. 4 stars",1355529600,,954,4.6726190476190474
8033482,5,B0002VQXGM,"Given that this wasn't an official Columbia release, I was surprised at how well this tape turned out in the audio/video departments. The prints of the shorts looked really good, especially ""Three Hams on Rye"".

As for the shorts themselves, Goodtimes picked a great selection of shorts. The aforementioned ""Three Hams"" is excellent as is ""Spooks"" and especially ""Income Tax Sappy"". Moe gives one of his grouchiest performances and bit player Benny Rubin is hilarious as the bearded dinner party guest.

An excellent tape all around.",1354752000,,533,5.186046511627907
8033483,2,B0002VQXGM,"Although Curly seems to be the preferred third Stooge these days, Shemp, who actually came on the scene before his younger Brother Jerome, did deliver some classy stuff between 1947 and 1955. Here are three shorts from the early '50s and the only classy ""Shemp"" comedy herein is the third entry, He Cooked His Goose - actually starring Larry Fine! The under-rated Fine plays a manipulative small business owner, whose business is, for all intents and purposes, to break up his buddies' realtionships.
Babysitter Jitters has a good premise and some strong supporting players, in a story about how three Babysitters can lose a Baby, only to find it in the company of the estranged Husband who has kidnapped the child while the *Stooges* napped. It's all resolved in a nice ending, when Mommy and Daddy reunite - amidst Stooge mayhem.
No real humour to be found, and alot of objectionable violence. One interesting, and touching aspect for the Stooge intelligensia: note the sailor cap worn by Moe, which resembles the cap shown in still pictures of Curly from his retirement! If memory serves, this film was made around the time of his passing. Perhaps Moe was paying tribute.
In Don't Throw That Knife Moe, Larry, And Shemp are census takers who take abuse from a hot-headed ""takee"", if you will - a magician just a *bit* careless with his props! More rough stuff...and none too funny.",1183852800,,1384,4.843881856540085
