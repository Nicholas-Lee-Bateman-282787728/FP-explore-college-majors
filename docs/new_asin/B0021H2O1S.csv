Good quality video and a shame it is not released in the US, region 1, as it would be good for those who like surfing, friendship, doing things outside the box!",1301875200,,300,4.245614035087719
8349012,4,B0021H2O1S,"I saw this at the Newport Beach International Film Festival, years ago, and loved it.
It was way and away the best movie I saw at the festival and we sat through a dozen or so.
I am really surprised that it isn't available in a U.S.-compatible DVD.
It's not on Netflix, either, and I guess that's why.
The movie has everything. A group of surfing buddies grew up on the beach and then, in their 30s, they are all scattered all over the country pursuing careers and having families and living grown-up lives. They find out that one of them is dying of leukemia, so they liberate him from the hospital, in the dead of night, and take him on one last big surf trip to Mexico.
This movie is a blast. In one scene, the sick guy is in a wheelchair, and they're in a bar in Mexico, and he ""dances,"" spinning and doing wheelies with a girl on his lap.
Fun and touching at the same time.
They drive an old Cadillac hearse, which is a perfect surf wagon, with the wheelchair on top, and sometimes the sick guy rides up there. Whee.
4.5 stars for me.",1289606400,,1039,4.2
