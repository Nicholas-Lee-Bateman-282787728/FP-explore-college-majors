3683318,5,B001LGFAJS,"Excellent family friendly movie. A young man finds himself on a mission trip to Tonga, where he doesn't know the language or anyone there. He leaves behind a girl he loves while showing the people of Tonga, a true love that never ends. In the process, they teach him about a  more simple way of life and the love of community. It is an excellent movie filled laughter, tears, and a yearning to be a better person after watching it.",1474848000,,431,4.3875

3683342,4,B001LGFAJS,"It didn't fully live up to my high expectations, but it was an enjoyable and inspirational movie about a young missionary's extreme trials in a Tongan village. To a friend who liked wholesome movies, my advice would be to definitely see it, but depending on the price, rent/borrow or buy used. The 'making of' special features are interesting as well. Be sure to watch them.

While the main character is obviously a Mormon missionary, I don't believe the name of the church is ever used or shown in the feature film - so it's definitely not a propaganda film or anything a skittish non-member should be afraid of. The fact that he is a mormon is almost irrelevant to the story.

And do not watch it because you're a fan of Anne Hathaway. Although she is charming in her role as the missionary's far-away love, as I suspected, her roll in this movie is very small. They are definitely just capitalizing on her well-known name. The 'love story' part of this film is very minimal. The real love is how this reluctant missionary dedicates himself to his mission and risks his life to help his Tongan community. The brief relationship between the missionary and the local priest was interesting and heart-felt as well.

I also suspect that this was a film that was bought and distributed by Disney after its making... I would be surprised if they actually produced it. It doesn't have a typical Disnified feel to it. Not quite as polished or sappy (don't get my wrong, I love Disney!).

I'd probably give this 3.5 stars, but I'll round up instead of down as a reward for good, wholesome filmmaking.",1442620800,,1593,4.638297872340425
3683343,5,B001LGFAJS,Wonderful mivie,1441411200,,15,7.0
3683344,5,B001LGFAJS,"The realism in the filming of this missionary experience of a General Authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints when he was young, is very exciting.  We serve the Lord best when we lose ourselves in the service of His children and realize that were ever they are He loves them too.  If more people could learn that we are really all God's children there would be fewer disagreements in this world.",1441238400,,416,4.4605263157894735
3683345,4,B001LGFAJS,"Another good movie geared toward anyone feeling like God is calling them to be a missionary. Many trials and temptation are presented, and yet the lead character shows that it is possible for the young people to exhibit integrity and faith in God.",1440115200,,247,4.767441860465116

3683363,2,B001LGFAJS,"The other side of Heaven is a wonderful movie. The down side is Anne Hathaway, the now grown woman. Having Grand Daughters and watching Ann Hathaway movies like the Princess Diaries and other respectful movies as well as the Other Side of Heaven I expected much more from her. The disappointing down side is like most Hollywood teens when they grow up they start doing nudity and bad language in their films and the nice young girl growing into a wonderful woman with strong morals and convictions as an adult isn't as I believed Ann Hathaway would have turned out to be. She is doing nude scenes in some of her movies now and the innocence of her personality has been lost to the perversions of Hollywood scripts and their producers to turn these nice young girls and boy's into making films Grandpa's like me feel ashamed and disappointed to see what they have become doing now.
Hopefully for those who watch this movie they will not relate her current behavior in films as actually being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who has went astray to the sins of the world. As far as I know she has never been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and hopefully she will not be mistaken as a fallen astray member. Hopefully she will repent her ways and go back to making clean wholesome films again and hopefully she may become a member of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints after all. Hopefully producers of future movies like this will be more discreet on who they hire as actors so they won't make our church look bad in the future.",1430956800,,1589,4.445205479452055

It's a true story about a Mormon missionary, so it has a good message and shows the hardships that come along with it.

3683418,1,B001LGFAJS,It's a very unique movie that shows the challenges of those who go on mission trips. It's not Hollywood fiction and close to human emotions of dealing with acculturation as well as the real attitude to persevere in ministry to 3 rd world areas. It's a little long and I wish that there were more scenes with his reunion with his homecoming experience.,1394409600,,351,4.587301587301587

3683443,5,B001LGFAJS,"My favorite Missionary movie. It reminds me of myself. I also bought the Kindle book.

3683451,5,B001LGFAJS,"We were given this video as a gift at Christmas and decided we wanted to watch it on New Years Eve.  My husband is recovering from a spinal cord injury so we planned on just the two of us for New Years Eve.  This being our 58th New Years Eve we have spent together, and that's exciting.

There is not one thing I could have or would have changed in this movie.  As I read some reviews - I find out it was a Mormon missionary which I didn't pick up on - if I had it would not have made any difference.

Those who left anything but positive reviews; have missed the main message of the film.  We need more true stories like this one; instead of videons of shut them up...bang bang.  I am thankful that his goal was to win people to the Lord using the bible in doing so.

You could see all the challenges he went through; and how a wonderful love had developed for Jesus and each other.

Excellent - a five star rating ...thank you for sharing this with us.  God's servent from Lodi CA....",1356998400,,986,4.088541666666667

3683453,5,B001LGFAJS,Great movie!  Happy that Disney made a movie of such religious event!  Good job showing some of the difficulties Mormon Missionaries can have during their two years on their mission!,1355529600,,182,5.033333333333333
3683454,5,B001LGFAJS,"I loved watching this.  It felt inspiring to me, like the next day ""I think I can do this...I can choose the right...if John Groberg can overcome awful things to do what's right, maybe I can too."" :)",1353801600,,199,4.2368421052631575
3683455,3,B001LGFAJS,"As wide-spread as the church is and especially being set in a different country, I'm surprised and disappointed my copy didn't have Spanish subtitled or dubbing--only in English!  I showed it to a recent convert, and the movie's action was enough that only a small amount of translation was needed.  Also, my DVD jacket describes this as an epic adventure but it was a story that was all TRUE!  It wasn't just the adventure of somebody's mind behind a typewriter, but for members of our church these are every day experiences for missionaries that are overcome with love, sacrifice and faith in the things we believe!  I guess we know that, but others may not.  I would recommend this movie to anyone!",1351987200,,701,4.713114754098361
3683456,4,B001LGFAJS,The movie shows the hardship of missionaires and maintaining their moral values in a country which has entirely different values.,1347667200,,129,5.5

3683458,1,B001LGFAJS,"I could not stand watching this movie and it was all I could do to not turn it off after 10 minutes.  It is unrealistic, inaccurate, cheesy and an overall poorly done movie.  It was made to serve as a fantastic feel-good movie for Mormons, who happen to have a heavy presence in Tonga.  The main Mormon school in Tonga also feels the need to post ""English Only Please"" signs around the perimeter of their facility which I find to be completely unacceptable.  I have no problem with people spreading the word of their religion as they deem necessary, but to occupy another country only to insist that the locals turn their backs on their language and customs is pretty unbelievable.

Anyways, this movie paints Tongans as being uneducated savages who are unwelcoming of outsiders.  I have been to Tonga many times and my experiences have been quite the opposite.

Don't waste your time with this movie.",1339891200,,901,4.7006369426751595
3683459,3,B001LGFAJS,"A decent movie about a missionary.

3683461,3,B001LGFAJS,"absolutely gorgeous cinematography.... the films highlight.... appreciated the insight on how deeply committed such a young man is to his 3 year mission... a testament to how powerful the LDS church is in defining roles and no allowance for questioning one's faith... personal experience with LDS missionaries amazes and inspires but have great sympathy for impressionable youth who are not even permitted to be present with anyone alone outside the church... makes you think fear is such a motivating factor... the yin-yang aspect of mother nature in it's glory devasted by same is poignant message... wish my faith was as strong but indoctrination wears thin after extensive exploration, education, enlightenment, etc., I want to know more about this religion without a thinly veiled one sided POV, my study of the Books of Mormon are fascinating but yield limited knowledge of the diversity of implementation, after life and practical motivations for basic tenets.  I enjoyed this film for the challenges presented to assimilate in Island culture and the heartfelt innocence portrayed...more realistic treatment would improve the message of sharing a spiritual path.",1334102400,,1169,5.458563535911602
3683462,5,B001LGFAJS,"The Other Side of Heaven is a great movie. I am a LDS member and I was amazed on all of the trials and tribulations that the missionary went thru and stuck with it. That is definitely dedication to the church. I admire the missionaries for being able to leave their home, friends and family for two years to teach the gospel to complete strangers. I would highly recommend this movie whether you are LDS or not. It is very inspiring!",1330300800,,433,4.3580246913580245

3683465,2,B001LGFAJS,"The movie wasn't bad but the best scene for me was about 1/4 of the way in the pale white Idaho missionary asks the Tonga missionary ""What if I don't believe?"" and the Tonga guy says ""then you came a long way for a lie"".",1316563200,,220,3.911111111111111

3683469,1,B001LGFAJS,I have many friends that are from Niuatoptapu and they were offended by the movie. They told me that the movie made elder Groberg seem like he was the greatest thing that happened to the island since metal. In fact he was like the typical mormon missionary who pushes their religion on to people regardless of what they say. When u lie to people that they are the decedents of a blessed lost tribe of Israel of course they are going to join your religion. My friends grandmother told me that the Mormon missionaries would basically buy them. When you give people the chance to come to the U.S if they get baptized of course they will do it. This movie doesnt show the way it really was but rather the way the Mormons want us to see them as. The great saviors of the pacific islanders. I'm just saying,1294099200,,800,4.34
3683470,5,B001LGFAJS,"Our family really enjoyed this movie.  It was so nice to see a movie with modest dress, nice language and great morals.

3683472,4,B001LGFAJS,The first time I saw this was on a plane returning from Fiji and am embarrassed to say cried when the storm hit and laughed at other times. In my view it is a good family movie made even better by the scenery and the wonderful actors.,1287446400,,234,4.0
3683473,4,B001LGFAJS,"This is an old school family type movie about a missionary that travels to the South Pacific to evangelize the island peoples. It's based on a true story and set sometime near the middle of the 20th century. Yes as stated in other reviews Anne Hathaway is only in the movie for about 10 or so minutes. This isn't a big budget movie but the production seems well done for what it is. I think it's good for families and people who like this kind of drama. I really don't think there is anything that would be found offensive to most any viewer of this film. My wife and I enjoyed it, my ten year old son thought it was boring. It would likely be better for teenagers, I imagine, as the themes of romance and self-sacrifice seem lost on my son ( he likes more action ). The main character in this movie happens to be a Mormon missionary, the Mormon part of which is down played to the point where I really think the character could interchangeably be a missionary for just about any faith. So if you're anti-Mormon, I don't think it is a real issue. Of course, a common complaint about the LDS (Mormon ) church is that they deceptively appear to be just like any other Christian denomination, when in fact they more closely resemble a cult. But knowing that going in, the movie doesn't really get too heavily into theology or doctrine Mormon or otherwise, but rather extols common virtues such as loyalty, perseverance, chastity, self-sacrifice, etc. I am not a Mormon and I enjoyed the film, and I think people of other faiths or no faith at all would enjoy it as well.",1267056000,,1567,4.406896551724138
3683474,5,B001LGFAJS,"An engrossing story set in a beautiful yet formidable place. Not preachy, just a story with Christian characters doing what they believe in.

This movie touches my heart and I can relate to it on so many levels.  I also was a young LDS missionary from Idaho Falls, sent to the Tongan Islands.  I too had a girl that was waiting for me.  I thought the movie was inspirational as well as entertaining.  The only things I felt a little negative about the movie were how the Tongans were portrayed at times.  In the movie it was Elder Grohber that taught the Tongans morality and was the spiritual leader of even the Tongan saints.  My experience was much different.  I was taught by the faithful Tongan saints whos morals were beyond reproach and who's spirituality helped me grow tremendously.  Despite that and a couple of Tongan language errors in the film I thought it was wonderful.  Oh and my girl didn't wait as promised.  Ofa atu",1207440000,,911,4.351190476190476
3683485,5,B001LGFAJS,I am LDS so the movie has a lot of meaning to me.  I is a wonderful story of a missionary who works so hard to bring the gospel of Christ to islanders.

I would like the DVD better if I hadn't read the book first, but now I don't care for the movie very much.  There are many very important, thrilling events which took place during the 3 years of this missionary's assignment in the islands that are not in the movie.  No time or room for everything, I guess.  Disappointing.  My advice would be to read the book first and then decide if you want to see the movie.",1163289600,,576,4.1909090909090905

When the narrator intoned that his High School teacher announced that something ""terrible"" had happened at Hiroshima I lost all interest.  If his teacher thought ending the war with Japan was ""terrible"", then she must have been hoping for him to die on the beaches of Honshu.

Either the narrator was lying or he was irretrievably stupid

Either way I lost interest in what was shaping up to be a really sappy film anyway.",1147392000,,503,4.617977528089888
3683489,4,B001LGFAJS,"Writer-Director Mitch Davis was a Mormon missionary to Argentina in the 1970s, so it is not surprising that he would be attracted to the story of John Groberg, who left his home in Idaho Falls at the age of 19 to travel to the South Pacific achipelago of the Kingdom of Tonga for his three year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Davis's script is based on Elder Groberg's 1993 memoir, ""In the Eye of the Storm,"" and the story that ends up on the screen is your basic stranger in a stranger land tale.  Of course it takes place on a gorgeous island in the South Pacific, so there is exotic local.  But while Grober is a Mormon missionary this film is largely a nondenominational tale of Christian missionary work (I wonder if that phrase is redundant or if there are non-Christian missionaries; obviously I consider Mormons to be Christians, and I understand some would debate the point, but I do not see how such a disticntion matters to this film).

We are introduced to young John Groberg (Christopher Gorham) he is playing trumpet at a swing party at Brigham Young University watching his girl, Jean Sabin (Anne Hathaway), dancing with some other guy.  So John finishes his trumpet solo, puts down his horn, and jumps down to do some serious rug cutting with Jean.  She is the rock he will be leaving behind, although the exact nature of their understanding is unclear, and despite the fact that is will take months for them to exchange letters.  That is how long it takes Groberg to get to his post on the island of Niuatoputap (pay attention to the lines he draws on the map to pick up on how he really does take the long way round).  Groberg is accompanied by Feki (Joseph Folau), who can help translate for the young missionary and save him from some embarassment over what is being said about him and what he is saying in his first speech in the native language.

There are problems to overcome and not just in terms of the language (this is one of those films where as soon as the main character learns the native tongue everybody starts speaking English).  The island already has a minister who warns the people against listening to the missionary and it turns out that sleeping with your feet uncovered is not a good idea.  Of course, Groberg will win over the natives, and we are not surprised that they make as big of an impression on them (the title of the film indicates as much).  But not as much of the film is about Groberg's missionary work as you might think (the key moment comes when he finally gets checked up on and is berated because he has not done the proper paperwork for baptizing people and buidling churches).  A lot of it has to do with trying to survive hurricanes and shipwrecks, not to mention some local customs that serve to remind how much of a different world he is living in now.  The letters back and forth between John and Jean are not as much as I anticipated, but we do appreciate how she is his rock and that heaven is not just returning to her to live happily ever after.  It is getting her to live with him in paradise.",1146873600,,3094,4.4416961130742045

Not only does it improperly portray Polynesians as waiting for a Christian God to save them, but it completely neglects the fact that Polynesians had a functioning culture before Christianity came to the islands.

  Yes,another missionary movie. But unlike The RM and God's Army,this is a more serious look (not saying there isn't any funny moments) at a life of a man,having to do God's work for people very different from the ones where he came from. He has to adjust for them (like missionaries of today),having to go through language and cultural barriers. Its inspiring as always but there are a few holes in this movie. I honestly didn't like it as much as the other mormon movies. I think you should have a background and familiarity about Mormons (or LDS as we are really called) to fully appreciate this film.

3683493,5,B001LGFAJS,"Based on John Groberg's autobiography ""In the Eye of the Storm,"" this story of a Mormon missionary's years in the Tongan islands is exceptional. With a strong faith-based message, it has a mix of heroism, pathos, and a good deal of humor that is truly funny because of its natural and real nature. ""The Other Side of Heaven"" gives us the sense of what it might be like to arrive in a strange land and adjust to the drastic changes in culture, language, diet and living conditions, and the loneliness of being thousands of miles from home. Born in Idaho, John attends the Brigham Young University, and the film starts out in 1953, with him playing the trumpet for a dance, where we meet his true love Jean. There is narration throughout the film of their letters over the course of the 3 years they are separated, and his devotion to Jean is one of the factors that help him endure the many hardships he faces.

Written and Directed by Mitch Davis, with a cast that includes non-professionals, the cinematography by Brian Breheny is often spectacular; filmed in Rarotonga (Cook Islands) and Auckland, New Zealand, the seascapes and sunsets are glorious, and the lovely score by Kevin Kiner adds to the beauty of the film. Christopher Gorham is wonderful as John; he has just the right blend of innocence, sincerity, and strength to carry the many aspects of the drama, and Anne Hathaway is good as Jean. Also outstanding are Joseph Folau as Feki, John's friend and assistant, and Paki Cherrington as the minister. Some have labeled ""The Other Side of Heaven"" as ""Mormon propaganda,"" but there is little mention of Mormonism in the film, instead it's a story of great human courage, man's ability to adapt and recover from devastating events, and a love that endures. The film ends with photographs of the real people in the story, and what became of them in later years, and it is a nice finishing touch to a film that is excellent family entertainment. Total running time is 113 minutes.",1128643200,,1987,4.709770114942529

3683495,5,B001LGFAJS,"You don't have to be a Mormon to appreciate this fine yet  simple true story of young John Groberg on his mission to the island of Tonga.  Language barriers, sweltering heat, torrid storms and starvation are just few of the challenges Groberg encounters as he attempts to to spread the Good News to the people of Tonga. With persistence and strong faith, young Groberg is able to make headway with the Tongans, and over time they come to respect him.  He, too, becomes a part of their lives and experiences deep emotional attachments to the people and their way of life.

As Groberg spiritually begins to mature, he also begins to grow emotionally.  Bonded by letters written to his High School sweetheart back home, aptly portrayed by the sweet and wholesome Anne Hathaway, their initial friendship over the years turns to admiration and eventually into deep love.

Albeit there is somewhat of an ""after-school special"" feel to the film, this is a great story about patience, faith and true love in the toughest of times.  Watch it.",1125100800,,1033,4.80225988700565

This is a movie that the whole family can watch over and over.

I enjoyed watching it with my wife for the romantic relationship between the missionary and the distant missionary.  Actually it was my wife who really enjoyed that bit.  The music was good and the overall quality of the film and shooting were very high.

I don't give it a high mark because it seemed just a bit too ""propaganda"". (Sorry for using a loaded word there, but it fits the best).  The LDS missionary is portrayed as one with Joseph (son of Jacob)like integrity, resisting all temptation.  He overcomes all obstacles.  He is pure in attitude while the non-LDS christian minister is portrayed as a hard biggoted man who sends thugs after the christ-like LDS missionary, but at the end even this protestant minister experiences a change of heart due to the LDS workers overwealming goodness.  The LDS missionary consistantly risks his own life to save others and works with great perserverance to establish LDS bases on several islands.  He is the hero that young LDS men should strive to be like.  (And hopefully Anne Hathaway will be waiting in a white dress for them whent hey get done their service.)

Strangly, the Bible is often quoted, but the cornerstone book of their faith, the book of Mormon, is never mentioned.  Perhaps this is to help the movie appeal to a wider, non-LDS, audience.",1123372800,,1526,4.649253731343284

Even though I was born and raised here in the US, I have been exposed to my Polynesian roots and love and embrace both cultures of who I am (Polynesian side and American side).

I have to say that my family and I LOVED this movie. It is refreshing to watch a beautiful movie without all the sex, violence and vulgar material that permeates our society today.  This movie is about True Love on so many levels - the love between Elder Groberg and his future bride Jean, the love between the Tongan people and Elder Groberg and the love between Our Lord and his children. No, I'm not Mormon, I'm actually an Assembly of God Christian, however that does not overshadow my appreciation for this movie.

The depiction of the people of Tonga is accurate. They are a lighthearted and loving group of people who love to laugh and find joy in the simple things of life. They are all about respect and honoring one's family.  The scene of the first funeral brought back memories for me as it illustrated exactly how these kind people handle the departing of a loved one.  When my dear Grandmother Siu passed away in 1994, my family and I traveled back to Vava'u (an island within the Kingdom of Tonga) to lay her to rest. The unmasked grief and crying as depicted in the movie was exactly how my grandmother's funeral was.  The crying and grieving took place for 1 full day (24 hours - day and night) while different groups of people from all the villages on the island, came to pay their last respects.

Hats off to Disney for going out on a limb to bring the story of one young man's journey of faith and trials and tribulations of his mission to the big screen! Well done!",1108425600,,1803,4.412650602409639

Truly good drama gives us three-dimensional characters who are flawed, who overcome inner demons to do something magnificent. Films that inspire do not resort to cardboard caricatures.
Grober is portrayed as a mix between Mother Teresa and The Wizard of Oz. He heals, he ""perseveres"", he picks up the language effortlessly. And he never gets sunburned or tanned, the mosquito bites leave no marks on his skin. He eats without fishing or picking berries. He builds without getting calluses on his hands.
And the Tongans were just waiting for him to come along and save them from their poor wretched existence. Before Grober, they were worthless worms.
That is, Grober did not get sunburned or have to work -- in the movie. The Tongans could not live without him -- in the movie.

Perhaps the most powerful element of the story is that a barely twenty-year-old caucasion male from Idaho who goes to a foreign land to bring Western religion could be portrayed sympathetically by Hollywood.
I also spent several years overseas doing religious work.  Although I am not Mormon, and my experiences were not a dramatic is the young man's in this movie, there were many similarities.  It was gratifying to see such a positive and realistic story being brought to the big screen.

The main character is supposed to be John Groberg, but as protagonists go he breaks one of the cardinal rules of storytelling, in that the protagonist is supposed to be the most compelling character. In the scene where the rich man with the yacht is taking girls onboard his ship the Protestant minister, and the LDS Branch President protest, but Elder Groberg stands by and does nothing. I also felt that the cutting between the scene onboard with the ship and the baptismal scene took much away from the power that the baptismal scene could have had. It seemed to me that the makers were a little afraid to show what Mormon culture was like in the islands. LDS filmmakers need to create stories and films of this quility, but not be afraid to show the LDS culture. (But don't go overboard as other LDS filmmakers have.)",1053475200,,975,4.609195402298851
3683513,5,B001LGFAJS,"Sure, this movie is about a Mormon missionary.  That fact, for some reason, is enough in-and-of-itself to scare many people away (and I can see why, after watching the abominable movie ""God's Army,"" which stuffs, rams, and forces Mormonism down your throat by trying to make the missionaries seem like just 'one of the guys').  In this film, however, it is not young Elder Groberg's religion which is important--rather it is his selfless service and message of hope and love which make this film what it is.  In fact, Disney does a great job of keeping references to Mormonism to a minimum, instead keeping the message one which all Christians should be able to relate to.
Groberg has some interesting experiences in his three years in Tonga--death, disease, natural disasters, and many other events mold not only him but the community at large.  He struggles with the language and has both difficulties and triumphs in his work.  At times, it seems he must take on the whole world, but each time he meets the challenge head-on with a fierce determination and a courage which are extremely admirable.
Above all, this is a message about faith.  It doesn't matter your religion, this movie will move and inspire you if you let it.  It doesn't push Mormonism on anyone, and that is perhaps what makes it so powerful.  The impact would be the same if the missionary were from any other faith.

3683515,4,B001LGFAJS,"""The Other Side of Heaven"" is based on the true story of John H. Groberg's experience as a missionary on the South Pacific island of Tonga.  The movie was produced by Academy Award winner Gerald Molen, producer of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" and released by Excel Entertainment, an outlet for Mormon media, and it's rated ""PG.""
Groberg (Christopher Gorham) was called by the Church for a three-year mission assignment to Tonga when he was a 20-year-old student at Brigham Young University in the 1950's.  Before leaving he makes a vague pact with his girlfriend, Jean, (Ann Hathaway).  A difficult seven week journey takes him to the South Pacific, where he meets his native Christian assistant and companion, Feki, (Joe Falou), and they finally arrive at the remote island of Niuatoputapu.  Groberg has been instructed to do two things:  learn the language and build the ""kingdom.""
Initially treated with scorn by the natives, he sets about to learn the language by reading the bible in English and in Polynesian.  After four days he has mastered the language, and begins to win the respect of the natives.  From here on, it's a series of incidents, each of which is a sort of independent story:  he resuscitates a seriously injured child; sleeping with his feet exposed leads to rats nibbling on the soles of his feet, requiring weeks of treatment to ""seal"" his feet; a boat trip with two natives nearly drowns them all when the boat is capsized by a storm; a severe storm destroys the island food supply, and everyone nearly starves to death.
The young native women are fascinated with Groberg, and one in particular offers herself---but Groberg is not tempted.  He is finally taken to task by the girl's mother for rejecting the daughter, but Groberg explains his moral view and his commitment to his true love in the U.S.  His experiences and his feelings are also conveyed through a series of letters to Jean, his fantasies about her, and her letters to him. They ultimately marry, in the movie and in real life, and return many times for mission work in the South Pacific.
There is lavish cinematography of the spectacularly beautiful islands and beaches, as Groberg grows to love both the people and the places. The storm special effects are very well done.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable story, made even more interesting by the knowledge that it is basically true.
The movie can be criticized for it's single-minded perspective on the role of the missionary, and there is little insight into the indigenous culture of the natives.  But it's very entertaining, and it's staggering to think of the hardships missionaries have endured to bring the benefits of our civilization to these far-flung places (a mixed blessing, some will say).  The story is told without proselytizing.  Theology and faith are important underlying ingredients but are not emphasized at all.  It's pure story telling, with no F words, little or no violence, a love story with no gratuitous sex.  I recommend it if you can enjoy an uplifting story, absent those typically R-rated elements.",1051056000,,3082,4.932301740812379

It made me laugh, it made me cry and above all made me think about what really lacks in many of our lives.

3683528,5,B001LGFAJS,"If viewers missed the first 15 minutes or so of the movie, I doubt any other than members of the Mormon Church would necessarily realize that it is about a Mormon missionary (except, possibly, for the give-away white shirt and tie). It could just as well be about a Catholic priest or other Christian missionary in a strange land, having to learn the language on the fly, knowing nothing about the people or their customs, who overcame all these and numerous other obstacles to learn to love the people and their customs. It was not a ""Mormon proselyting/propaganda piece"" at all. How to present a story about a missionary (of any faith) on a proselyting mission without at least some ""preaching"" is a mystery to me, but that is one objection I have seen in various venues.
I would agree with and can find little to add to the preceding reviews that found the film inspiring, uplifting, and even enlightening. Having read the book (after seeing the movie), I can say that virtually everything in the movie was right out of the book. I heard comments coming out of the move that it didn't follow the book for various reasons:
* ""In the book the big storm happened first, on the way to the islands."" The book presented the big storm (referred to in other reviews as ""the perfect storm"") in the first chapter (hence the original title of the book, ""In the Eye of the Storm""), but it should have been clear that this was something that actually happened some time during Elder Groberg's 3-year mission experience, not enroute to Tonga. I presume that its location in the movie was closer on the timeline to where it actually occurred.
* ""I didn't like the way the so-called Mission President talked to (Elder Groberg). No Mission President would talk that way."" Nonetheless, that scene depicted the pretty much as it was portrayed in the book. Of course I have no way of assessing the voice inflections, etc., but since Elder and Sister Groberg were, as I understand it, present on the set for a good part if not all of the filming, I am sure it was pretty accurate. He also apologized the next morning for his attitude the previous day.
For anyone interested, other deviations from the book were as follows:
* As with ""The Lord of the Rings,"" if you put everything in the book into the movie it would be twice as long-some things had to be left out.
* The location was confined to one island, Niuatoputapu, rather than the several that Elder Groberg actually was stationed on at various times or that he visited, and incidents that actually involved several different persons and islands were limited to a few characters from the island of Niuatoputapu. This probably to keep the cast of characters from being totally confusing to the viewer as well as to keep production costs down (it's no ""Midway"" or ""Pearl Harbor,"" after all).
* The actual ""preaching"" and, for those who would call it that, ""Mormon propaganda"" were in the book, mostly in the form of scriptural quotes from the Bible as well as the other Mormon scriptures. For the most part, any ""preaching"" done in the movie was worded in such a manner as to not raise the ire of the non-Mormon Christian. Unfortunately there are those who would find reason to complain no matter what was said or done once they discovered that it was a movie involving a Mormon.

3683531,4,B001LGFAJS,"By far the best of the recent spat of ""Mormon movies""
Professional reviews claimed the movie did not build towards a climax enough and just sort of floated along.  Although this is accurate compared to many movies in theatres, Other Side of Heaven is not boring at all.  It is emotionally touching and it keeps your interest.  It is a true story and it remains fairly close to the book in describing the events.
The last reviewer felt the movie was too well constructed as a story. (as opposed to movie critics who thought it was not constructed enough)  It is much more smooth than the book, and there are little things that can't be portrayed in a 2 hour movie.
To those turned away by the last reviewer, I don't think he paid much attention.  Other Side of Heaven portrays a missionary going to an Island that has already been largely converted to Christianity.  Whether you believe Mormonism is a cult or a Christian religion, it does not matter.  The movie is not about the educating of ""pagans"" and co-opting a culture. It is about the growth of an individual missionary and the growth of the people around him.  The cultural things that Elder Grober speaks against in the movie are not actual parts of Tongan culture, but things that were brought by previous imperialist expansion. (Alcohol and bribing government officials)  I am not sure where Douglas LaRose (the previous reviewer) got his idea about the symbolism in the movie, but he wasn't paying much attention.  The people rolling their eyes at a mourner were not rolling their eyes at a mother expressing sorrow.  They were rolling their eyes at a professional mourner.  Some one who comes to funerals and pretends to be sad so that they can get free food and a place to stay.
If you are a Latter-day Saint and you have read the book you may be bothered by things that are missing.  If you are not LDS, you may be a bit confused about Mormon culture during the beginning of the movie.
And being on a small budget some of the filming could have been a whole lot better, but it is not enough to detract from the story.
A lot of people come to this movie expecting to hate it because they don't like Latter-day saints or ""Mormon"" culture.  Others come and they will love it no matter what because it is about their Church.
Come without bias and be prepared for an entertaining movie.  It is not perfect.  Mormon or not there will be things that will bug you and things you will love.  But either way this is an overall excellent movie that is suitable for people of all ages.",1020643200,,2538,4.494553376906318
3683532,1,B001LGFAJS,"Like the feature character in this movie I spent many years in Tonga, but more years and spaced out over the past thirty years or so.  I married a Tonga woman years ago, learned the language fluently and still speak it daily, raised children both here and in Tonga, and have done extensive studies the socio-cultural history of Tonga with a special interest in church and state.
My Tongan wife I went to see the movie thinking it might in some way protray our romantic courtship and subsequent marriage in Tonga. As it turns out, I was grossly insulted and it was the first time I have actually seen my Tongan wife actually mad at something like a movie.
Groberg and the producer so grossly mischaracterized Tonga culture and the Tongan situation that I question whether Groberg was ever stepped outside of the door of his Tongan fale the entire time he was in the Niua's and Ha'apai.  If he did it was with his eyes closed and his brain tuned out.  By the way, for those of you who may watch the movie belching is one of the most rude bahaviors in Tonga!!  But belching is only the tip of the iceberg of cultural mischaracterizations in this belching movie.
The native language was close to obliterated.  Not that any non-Tonga who might watch the movie would know, but this demonstrates the depth of ethnocentricity and gross cultural insensitivity with which this movie was made.
The producer was Morman.  The Mormons have many dozens of churches, a large school campus, and even a Temple in Tonga.  Mormons comprise more than 15% of the resident Tongan population.  There are hundreds if not thousands of Tongans in Salt Lake city.  One would think that under these circumstances the producer could ""get it right.""
This grossly overdramatized film was obviously meant to be the cleverest of Mormon prosthletization productions.  It re-created scenarios in such a way to grossly over-dramatize the experiences of a Mormon missionary while heaping great insults onto the gentle Tongan people and their wonderful culture.
Good Mormons everywhere, but especially Mormon missionaries, should be so embarrassed as to demand that this film be removed from the market.

3683533,4,B001LGFAJS,"I would like to reply to the ""Anthropologist's Nightmare.""  First of all, what is wrong with emphasizing a character's Christ-like qualities?  John Groberg was aspiring to be like Christ, therefore he would then exhibit Christ-like qualities.  The other reviewer does not even state how they feel about these Christ-like qualities being shown.  The general feeling of that paragraph is negative, but there is no 'so what?' to their argument.  The main character believes in being Christlike, and so what the audience believes does not necessarily make John Groberg's beliefs or anyone else's ""wrong"" or ""bad.""
The reviewer also does not state what is so wrong about stories with suspense, temptation, good triumphing over evil, and miraculous rays of light.  These elements were done very well in the film, using cinematography and lighting to show their belief that good triumphs over evil.  And if they are not familiar with the original story, then how can they comment on the story unfolding like ""crisp pages of a new book?""  Perhaps that is how it really happened.
One last thing I cannot forget to mention is that this film was  directed by Mitch Davis, who has a Master of Arts from USC.  He is *not* a film student at this point in time, although the term ""student"" is quite relative.  I hope Mr. Davis, as well as the rest of the world, never stops learning.
Overall, I give this film 4 stars.  It is not perfect, in my opinion, but perfection is hard to achieve.  I found The Other Side of Heaven's message very enlightening, inspiring, and uplifting.  It was also entertaining and had romance, drama, humor, suspense, and action.  I definitely recommend this film.",1020384000,,1676,4.8936170212765955
3683534,2,B001LGFAJS,"As an anthropologist, watching this movie did anything but inspire me.
I was terrified, petrified, horrified, and astonished at the euphemism that ""The Other Side of Heaven"" preached. A Mormom missionary goes to the Pacific Islands intending to convert ""pagans"" to Mormonism, a then spreading cult in the western United States (during the 1950's), and he is faced with the challenges of sin, and misunderanding among his converts.
The film Christianizes the main character to the extent that when he departs for the Pacific Islands, his father remarks that he loves man so much that he has given ""his only begotten son."" Throughout the film the main character performs various miracles on islanders, and travels to surrounding islands establishing churches, thus symbolizing his ""Christ-like"" qualities. There is even an islander who reminds us of Mary Magdelaine.
Although I am not familiar with the actual story, I do not expect that the missionary's acceptance would have been so smooth and gracious. The story unfolds like crisp pages of a new book, with moments of suspense, temptation, triumph over evil, and miraculous rays of light from the hands of God [as symbolized in the movies constant return to a shot of the sun glazed over with a whitening effect, symbolizing the star that allegedly was revealed to the Native Americans when Jesus appeared in North America (The Book of Mormon)].
What hurts me more than anything is the emphasis the film puts on the pagan barbarism of the culture that existed before the missionaries presence. The Tongans become primordial subjects exposed to a Western ""cleansing."" There is a funerary scene which shows a fat woman collapsing on her dead son's body (in part of a ritualistic dance), while the ""converted"" shake their heads, and roll their eyes in arrogant disbelief.  This can be attributed to the ""white mans burden,"" and the atrocious moral imperialism that Western culture has embraced and lain on the world.
I cannot forget to mention that this film was directed by a film student who just graduated from Brigham Young University, so the interesting story and culturally interesting spectacle allows a high 1 star to low 2 stars.

Mitch Davis has done a good enough job with the screenplay but the man needs some help directing. Sure, the performances are fine, but the pacing needs some serious help. It's the same mild-mannered pace from beginning to end. Even in the face of danger, we are faced with the same pacing.
And, when watching this, you have to wonder if this is a step back for LDS stories on the silver screen? Richard Dutcher has created hard-core and GRITTY films about a faith that is overall a mystery to the majority of the earth (even to many of the members.) No grit in this movie though. It's the same peaceful feeling from beginning to end. Too bad.
But with all of these problems, it was still a very entertaining movie. The young man who played Feki (sorry, I have forgotten his name) was very entertaining and I found Christopher Gorham to be completely charming from beginning to end. Anne Hathaway served her purpose well, though her part is very limited.

It was a beautiful story but realistic also. Having spent 3 years myself in the mission field in another culture (Alaskan native peoples) I could relate. The film had everything from humor like when the young elder gives his first speech in the language of the people. He confuses the word ""Lighthouse"" with ""Outhouse."" The audience both on screen and in the theatre laughed long and loud for that one. Serious moments too like when he prays for the child thought dead - exciting moments on the sea, hurricane, and ordinary times of prayer, fasting, and feasting. Ann Hathaway does a good job as the girl who is left back home - the faithful letter writer of 3 years. I would liked to have seen more of her in the story. The people who played the native islanders were excellent and darn near stole the show. But then it wasn't really a show to be stolen. Just a good story, that's what!

The camera shots in one scene could have been better pulled off by a teenager with a camcorder, and some of the waves in the storm scene look like they're in a pool.
On the other hand, though, this movie wasn't meant to be a technological marvel.
This movie tells the missionary story of John H. Groberg, a Seventy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  He served in far-away Tonga, without knowing a lick of the language.  Given only two goals (learn the language and build the kingdom), John faces many obstacles.  Language barriers, a stubborn minister, storms, death, and rats.  On top of all that, his girlfriend in the States, Jean, is staving off suitors, anxiously awaiting John's return 3 years hence.
