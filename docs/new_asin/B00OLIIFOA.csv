6755858,5,B00OLIIFOA,"Way more episodes then I expected, but its worth it, by the way the the cover over the collection is different, its still lucci but without the StrawHat jolly roger, its Denies Lobby World Govt flag instead, and if you wonder what that looks like just go to One Piece Collection 12 and it looks like that but with Rob Lucci on instead of Spandam, I recommend amazon change this so buyers won't get mad when they receive this awesome disc Collection",1423440000,,448,4.475609756097561

Not sure if I'm addicted or not, and whether that should be a bad thing, considering how freaking amazing this anime is.
