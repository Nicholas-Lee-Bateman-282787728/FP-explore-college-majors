6486079,5,B00LGD53L6,"I quite enjoyed these 7 episodes (almost 6 hours) of this Canadian series from 2013.  It may only be the first half of season 1, but the price is reasonable; many 2 hour films cost more.  The eastern Canadian-ness and slightly slower pace are refreshing; the empathetic approach and scenarios  held my interest.  The actors, even extras,  are all too beautiful to be totally believable - not plastic Hollywood types, but not the average person-on-the-street that the British use so effectively.  I was distracted be how thin they appeared - almost anorexic since the camera is said to add 10 or 20 pounds.  Perhaps it was just the tight clothes and ghastly hip-hugger fashions.  I hope Amazon offers the second half of season 1 and all of season 2 very soon;  BBC Shop doesn't carry them either.",1425945600,3,795,4.744525547445256

I've had a terrible time finding DVDs for the other half of season 1 or for season 2 at all.  If you want to watch all of season 1, you're better off watching it online.",1425340800,4,280,3.7288135593220337

NOT DESIGNED AS AN ADRENALINE FILLED THRILLER IF THATS WHAT YOU CRAVE  --- BUT AN EXCELLENT SERIES WITH INTERESTING CHARACTERS

***WHY SOME AREN'T LIKING THIS SHOW: Many readers will notice a lot of negative reviews.  Please accept this attempt to help both those who will dislike, and those who will enjoy the show figure out where they fit in.  This show is definitely different than American audiences are used to and my review is meant to warn, just as much as it is to praise.  This crime solving show is not as sensational as say a CSI or The Wire.  It is dramatic, but just different.  The characters are not as stereotypically beautiful as Hollywood actors (there are still some very attractive people).  Though I love the sensational stuff too, sometimes I also like something a little slower and off beat.  That's more the direction of this show which often solves crimes by simply relating or thinking the way of the people involved. If you are one who will hate the show, keep in mind I am trying to help you too.

INTRO: Starts a little slow, and took several episodes for me to understand and enjoy the characters.  This Canadian made crime solving drama uses a somewhat different premise and progresses at it's own pace.  For those looking for an adrenaline filled thriller or shoot-em'-up with lots of gun play, this really isn't it.  There is still action, there is still gun play, but the cases they present are a little more complicated as they deal with perpetrators, witnesses and victims with specific problems with psychological or emotional instability.  Hence the special psych crimes unit.  That may not sound interesting to some, but it does allow them to approach episodes with a little more freshness of plot and story line.  I thought the plot was very fresh and somewhat more earthy in many cases.  Of course it's not as polished and high octane as a Hollywood series.  But for those who like Canadian cinema and TV, that's part of the draw and a welcome change now and then.

THE PLOT:  Aidan Black is a former tactical team officer (similar to SWAT) who has suffered a trauma on a previous mission gone bad.  After an emotional breakdown and temporary mental lapses, he is moved (ironically) to a newly formed Psychological Crimes Unit.  This new concept within the department pairs his tactical expertise with a psychiatrist Daniella Ridley, who has left a prestigious hospital position to join the police force and design this new unit.  The viewer quickly learns that Aidan is in the unit for more than one reason.  Using the ""it takes one to know one"" kind of approach, Aidan relates to the people they encounter.  He is sort of the shooter on the team when things are bad, but he also uses his insight from his own problems to help the criminals or victims.  The attractive Dr. Ridley is the actual professional perspective on the team, but deals with problems in a more sensitive and even maternal way when called for.  The conflict is that Daniella is also there to keep an eye on Aidan and report back to the department head, particularly if Aidan seems to be coming apart.  That may sound bland to some and it does move at a slower pace.  But I often found the situations engaging and the characters were very sympathetic.  I did find myself liking them, caring about them, and about how things were resolved.  That is the mark of great character development and good casting.  Ultimately Aidan will see the harsher realities in other peoples illnesses, which turns an ugly mirror on his own potential self destruction.

FINAL THOUGHTS: The police in this show may not have as chiseled jaw lines or arms like cannons, but the premise is fresh and engaging.  The production values are excellent and there is a particularly Canadian feel to the series that is a plus or minus depending on your personal tastes.  For me it's a plus to have an alternative now and then.  If this sounds remotely interesting to you, I definitely recommend the show.  It might be best to rent unless you pick it up cheap.",1421798400,31,4204,4.684856753069577
