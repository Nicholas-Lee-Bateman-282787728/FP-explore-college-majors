8295421,4,B001DXS424,"Having watched a few videos on Lincoln I thought this is the best in terms of background info and pace. The ambitions he had, the problems with his wife, including her corrupted dealings behind his back and the challenges he had in dealing with his generals in the civil war call come out well. It may not be perfect but it is worth watching.",1376611200,2,342,4.359375

8295425,2,B001DXS424,"This DVD alternates between periods of narration which are illustrated with still photographs and interviews with historians.

I am not an expert on Lincoln or the Civil War, but I had read 2 or 3 books on Lincoln before purchasing this DVD for use with a class that I am teaching.  I am glad I previewed it.  As I watched it I kept hearing the narrator state things that seemed to disagree with what I had read, so I went back and checked a couple of items.  The narrator stated that Lincoln's mother died when he was 8 years old; Lincoln was born in February 1809 and his mother died in October 1818 (over nine years later).  He stated as fact that Lincoln was engaged to Ann Rutledge, which some historians doubt because it was based only on her relatives' claim, and that Lincoln was later engaged to Mary Owens.  According to letters written by Lincoln, he had told Owens' sister that he would ""take her for better or worse"" and he thought Owens was interested in him long after he had lost interest in her, but when he decided he had delayed the matter as long as he could and ""made the proposal to her direct,"" Owens turned him down.  He felt she had made a fool out of him.  There were a few other areas that I can't remember now where I caught myself saying ""What?"" during the DVD, and I concluded that whoever wrote the narration had been sloppy in their research.  I did not catch any errors in the historians' interviews, but none of their information was new or earth-shaking.  Some seemed to be Lincoln experts but it was unclear what the others' credentials were other than they offered variety in the talking heads.

I will not be using this DVD with my class; I feel I wasted my money.",1297123200,10,1702,4.388535031847134
8295426,5,B001DXS424,"If you were going to buy only one Lincoln biography in your life, this is it.  A wonderfully told story. Many viewpionts.  I love the actors high, squeeky voice they use for Lincoln.  The honesty Lincoln expressed in the sadness he felt that the Negroe had caused America, a terrible idea from the British, slavery.  His plan to ship the Negroes back to Africa, and later, to resettle them in Panama, to untimately, letting stay in America with freedom.  A moving Dvd, suitable music.  But it!",1269561600,11,493,4.674418604651163
8295427,5,B001DXS424,This DVD is well done and tells the good and the bad about the most controversial President in American History. I would recommend it to anyone charged with teaching American History on the High school or Middle School levels.,1249084800,5,226,4.82051282051282
