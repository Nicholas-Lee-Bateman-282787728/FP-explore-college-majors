8373023,3,B002LFPBM4,"this is an actual review of the movie/dvd and not merely a rant based on the trailer and misguided anger over its title.
i can't break this down into pros and cons because the things that make it awful are also what make it entertaining.
1) if you watch the trailer, its evident that this movie is going to be terrible, to expect otherwise would be fairly unrealistic
2) the effects, plot, action, and acting are all amusingly bad
3) the dvd has close to no features/extras ... just some trailers for a handful of horror movies.  the dvd doesnt even come with subtitles

the amazon product description is taken directly from the back of the dvd but it seems to present way more plot than the movie is able to.

this is a hokey B sci-fi movie, plain and simple.  i can't imagine the people that made it took it seriously, and if you even hazard to watch it, you would probably be better served to do the same.  i can't give it anything more than 3 stars, because it really is quite bad but i found its ridiculousness to be very funny.  that said, i wouldnt recommend anyone actually buys this.",1262908800,,1092,4.354679802955665
8373024,1,B002LFPBM4,"""Guada Prime"" is the name of a planet, situated to key events for the series 4 finale of ""Blake's 7"".  With a plot that has a heck of a lot more depth and intrigue than this cornball-and-not-in-a-good-way, childish, clichd, videotaped, gaudy, trite, wannabe FLUFF of a ""movie"" - the sort that can be found in 99% of modern ""sci-fi"" already.

I saw the trailer and that's more than enough, never mind what else I bothered sitting through - and trust me, even sitting through the trailer is far more than enough to avoid this like the plague.  Heck, the plague is vastly preferable by comparison!  Worse, there's nothing anybody can do to reclaim the minutes or hours they wasted with this uninspired garbage that rips off a cool name from a totally disparate (and superior) sci-fi property.",1255219200,,789,4.737226277372263
