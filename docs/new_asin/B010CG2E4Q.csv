7307027,5,B010CG2E4Q,"This movie is very simple; a man goes after his younger brother who is lost in a territory that has been mysteriously quarantined in an area that is desolate. Everything has been abandoned saved for a creature that has been killing humans and leaving their bodies to rot. Brian, our hero is tracking his brother Sam, who has been leaving clues as to whereabouts. These creatures in the area are going after Sam, who has been studying them, tracking them and learning their weaknesses. They are unable to detect you if you are around dead bodies or if you are covered with the remains of the dead (ashes). They are attracted to electricity and they can be seen with infrared. All these creatures nuances have been meticulously detailed in a book and left for Brian by Sam. The story progresses in delightful twists and turns, encapsulating the audience with the frantic chase between hunter and prey.

As for the movie visuals, it was shot against the beautiful backdrop of Austrailia, with familiar landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House. The visuals capture the beautiful layout of the continent and simple shots add so much more to the story and the feeling of emptiness that amplify the story that there are only two beings on the entire continent.

This character driven piece keeps you involved at all times. When you think that the scene will drag, something comes out of the dark and pulls you through an emotional roller coaster for a few seconds, then you are back again. This particular filmmaker is no stranger to making pieces on a low budget with superior casting and storyline and this specific film is no exception to his track record. How To Save Us is a great independent piece and should not be missed!",1447804800,7,1722,4.717607973421927
7307028,4,B010CG2E4Q,"Best low budget flick I've seen yet. Well thought out story. Though it could use a little tightening, but pretty darn good; better than I've seen from most unknown film-makers. Poorly constructed story lines are the biggest problem of most films these days. This film beats that syndrome. Editing nice. Good use of resources and lighting, and some pretty nice shooting (tight shots make for great drama, and make a good story better, which it did in this case) and nice lighting. I loved that you didn't have to fallback on special effects. So many films--even big budget films--let the story falter because they figure they can sell it with CGI. Loved the fact it wasn't laced with F-bombs--every other word--because that made it more real for me. Thanks for the entertainment! Now keep going and make another.

7307029,2,B010CG2E4Q,"I can find real entertainment value in a low-budget horror film. ""How to Save Us,"" though, is not really a horror film (though it is a low-budget indie film). If you're seeking thrills and chills, you won't find them here.

Fundamentally, this is a story about a family torn apart by an alcoholic and abusive father, and how they find each other again. The journey the hero takes is a transparent metaphor for inner searching and a return to loved ones. The ghosts are quite literally ghosts of the past. The finale takes place in a ghostly version of the family home, and resolves a family issue.

All of this <could> have had the makings of an indie classic, and low as the budget obviously is, the director here shows some signs of talent. Unfortunately, the director also chose to play the lead, and in that role, well, he's terrible: wooden, self-conscious, lacking screen presence. Almost everything else that's wrong about the movielack of actual scariness, low production values, some medium-sized plot holes, etc.could have been okay with a strong lead. As it is, it's not a very good movie.",1447545600,3,1100,4.78421052631579

7307031,2,B010CG2E4Q,"Brian's younger brother Sam goes missing in Tasmania during the middle of a mysterious quarantine. Brian must travel to the deserted island to save his brother from a land now solely inhabited by demonic spirits. In order to survive, he must follow a set of rules: including covering himself with human ashes, to cloak his presence from the malevolent entities haunting the barren landscape. That is the description they gave...here is mine. Horrifyingly dull, mind-numbingly boring and unfocused. No real dialog just these 2 brothers wandering (separately) across the landscape and the older brother following the notes left by the younger! What are these dimensional creatures? Are they ghosts? Are they breaching a dimensional doorway as one broadcast suggests? I have no Clue at all. I don't think anyone knows what this thing wanted to be, I really don't. Do not waste your time.

7307055,3,B010CG2E4Q,"Tasmania has been evacuated because of a possible viral outbreak. Sam (Coy Jandreau) is still on the island. His brother Bryan (Jason Trost) at the insistence of their sister Molly (Tallay Wickham) goes there to find him. The island has been taken over by ghosts and there are specific rules for survival which have been written down in a notebook called ""How to Save Us."" The ghost attack by smell. The ashes of dead people can mask the smell. The ghost are attracted by electricity. Graveyards appear to be safe havens. Don't go out at night. Lock all the doors. Beware of the wind. They can be seen with infrared.

If you freeze frame the book as they page through it, you can get all the rules. There are broadcasts on the radio (106.9 FM) that are the ghosts talking as well as old broadcasts. And there is something strange...some of the broadcasts are personal for Bryan.

The film moves slow. We see Sam covered with ashes walking along the island covered in ashes being tracked by his brother covered in ashes. They are sometimes irritated by ghosts. This is a low budget  Australian production which was basically a two man play. Things pick up at the end where most of the budget was spent.

7307056,1,B010CG2E4Q,"nope.

the stupid is strong with this one.

it's a pseudo-psychological horror attempt.  or something.  not sure what to call it except *bad*.

the visuals are good, the cinematography, that is, but this is a b-movie that was shot on good film, and there is no sense to it.  it's not science fiction and it's not really horror, it's more of an allegorical for child abuse and a simpering excuse for a psychotherapeutic feel-good session.

7307057,4,B010CG2E4Q,"I found this by a recommendation.  I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews on this film.  It is a solid indie Sci- Fi / Horror/ Drama.  You have to commend a filmmaker that can make a compelling movie with such a grand premise without any money.  It is far from perfect, yet it does a good job of scary and keeping you intrigued.  If you are looking for an FX heavy, action filled movie, this is not it.  This is a slow burn emotional driven film.  It is slow in many places, however you get sucked in by the beautiful cinematography and the tone down silence.  Think of this as The Road with Ghosts instead of Cannibals.  I do not recommend this film if you are expecting a gore heavy show. You will be heavily disappointed.",1451606400,2,733,4.178571428571429

7307063,5,B010CG2E4Q,"How To Save Us is a mixed bag of awesomeness for anyone looking for a unique horror movie to watch. I found this little post apocalyptic gem while browsing a list of on demand titles, it popped up when I was searching for zombie themed content. What first caught my eye of was the cover, it reminded me a lot of the protagonist of the Fallout games. (Right down to the pip-boy light on his arm.) The plot of How To Save Us gives a nod to a few different video game genres, I viewed elements that seemed to borrow inspiration from the Fatal Frame and Silent Hill franchise. Ultimately these homages work in movie's favor, though the plot does feel a little convoluted at times. The synopsis is that a man named Brian Everett must go into a quarantined area in order to save his younger brother. The twist is that this area has been overtaken by ghost like creatures who can only be seen with infrared light or detected through radio devices. There is a brief moment where the film takes a psychological turn that will make any Silent Hill 2 fan smile with appreciation. I really liked this movie a lot and I think I will experience more enjoyment the second time around. If you enjoy horror video games I think you will find something to enjoy here too. I give How To Save Us a four out of five stars.",1450569600,4,1300,4.331967213114754
7307064,1,B010CG2E4Q,"Hahahaha, so I just had to update my review... Almost immediately after this critique went live, everyone involved with this film (and the people that ""reviewed"" it on here) down-voted my review because it's the only honest one on here. Geez, they legitimately told each other to get on at one time and label it as""unhelpful"". I've never been so popular on here!

Be warned, most (if not all) of the positive reviews for this film on Amazon are from people related in some capacity to its production.

I found the idea for The FP humorous, All Superheroes Must Die appalling and this one... Well, it had zero reason to be feature-length.

99% of the movie is comprised of our hero walking around barren environments. Sometimes, he even treks back across the same shots and environments. Sometimes he has extremely drab monologues that are also terribly expository... Funny considering there's nearly no narrative that needs explaining...

It' simply about a quarantined ghost-area in Tazmania and the protagonist wanders into it to find his missing brother (a final request from their sister). Oh yeah, and their dad died during the outset of the film so there's that. Meanwhile, their are ghosts... Sometimes... And by sometimes I mean next to nil. And when the two that are in the film appear, they're just blurred out forms. Trost has some interesting ideas (well, sorta) regarding the ghosts and how you deal with them, but it's also very shoulder-shrugging. They don't come off as a threat because they're nearly non-existent and every aspect of the small ""cut-corners"" budget shows.

The only moment in which anything happens is when he modifies a Power Glove to magically be an EMP device (Wha--?) He then uses it like, twice. It's really just there to stroke the nerd vein.

Worse, a lot of the dialogue seems more dependent on improvisation than actual writing. This is especially clear during a rather embarrassing monologue akin to Blair Witch's ""cry-scene"". Trost gives it his all... In the most expository and gratuitous ""coming to God"" moment of the whole flick. Had anyone walked in on me while this scene played, I would have found it hard to explain that it was a serious film and not a backyard project.

When I finally got to the end, the only thing I could muster was an ""Oh... Okay.""

It's a ridiculous slog and inhabits the worst elements of indie-filmmaking. Had this been a 10 minute short, I can see it working slightly better. But, geez, there's nearly nothing here to warrant a stretched-out, hour-and-a-half long flick.

On a side note, I ""like"" that they took The Last of Us's font and tried to market off of that video game's popularity.

Trost has an obvious love for cinema, but I'd rather he save up and do a film properly than have aimless flick after aimless flick that feels as though it's shot on $20.",1450483200,4,2838,4.785276073619632
7307065,5,B010CG2E4Q,"Entering into this film, I was already a Trost fan.  I enjoyed his previous work on The FP, All Superheroes Must Die and #WetAndReckless.  This film is completely opposite from all those films in tone.  It's much lower budget with zero ""star power"", whereas all three of the aforementioned films had at least a recognizable name.  The film plays out almost like an old school video game and offers frights and chills instead of the shock and gore of most current horror style films.  And, he does it on roughly the same budget most studio films spend on one days worth of craft services.  For anyone wh complains about the unoriginality of many main stream films, keep supporting the indies and lead the charge to change.  Trost loves filmmaking and loves film",1449792000,2,760,4.712121212121212

7307068,4,B010CG2E4Q,"This is Jason's best filmed movie yet. The story has an original feel and is refreshing but it falls a bit short in the final act and the reveal was kind of lame. But the movie is worth a watch or two.

7307069,4,B010CG2E4Q,"Beautifully produced, with an admirable avoidance of cliches, even though it dances around a lot of classical horror themes.  There is a concise but still richly nebulous plot full of potentials.  This results in disquieting suspense as you try to foresee which potential path the story is going to end up following.  The contrast of the nearly silent scenic emptiness with the folky radio broadcast, interrupted by static and wind where danger lurks, also plays up the growing state of interior mental and emotional reality where past, present and future start to become convoluted and nonlinear.  Seeking the doorway through which these alien ghost like beings enter this world, it becomes unclear which dimension and time will reveal the answer.",1448755200,8,748,5.208333333333333
