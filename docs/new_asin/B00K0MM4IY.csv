6397724,5,B00K0MM4IY,"The Very Vegimal Christmas is my four year old son's favorite episode since he loves Tunip and the vegimals and the chicken egg timer.  He especially likes it when the vegimals sing their song to the tune of Jingle Bells at the end.

Does it bother anyone else that Tunip says turnip instead of Tunip during the creature report song?",1461888000,,333,4.533333333333333
