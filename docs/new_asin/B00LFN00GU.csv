6481908,4,B00LFN00GU,"A fantastic Italian horror slasher, but one of the more obscure ones. If you're a fan of Argento, Fulci, or Bava, this is definitely a film you need to check out.",1419984000,,162,4.258064516129032
6481909,5,B00LFN00GU,Michelle Soavi's Stagefright is one beautiful film. The colors and camera work are amazing and Simon Boswell's score is outstandingly beautiful. The characters are great and the whole concept is done well and is different. The killer is awesome too the owl head mask is creepy as hell. Awesome effects in this one. Highly recommended!!!,1417046400,5,336,5.127272727272727
6481910,4,B00LFN00GU,"The movie: Colorful slasher pic seemed a bit better back in 1987 but it's still entertaining for fans of the genre.  The set-up is simple but effective--a company of actors rehearsing a macabre musical get locked inside the theater with an escaped maniac, a former actor himself so he knows his way around a theater and has a definite sense for the dramatic.

Stagefright is surprisingly stylish when you consider that it was written and produced by Italian schlock-meister Joe D'Amato, but first-time director Michele Soavi had worked as an assistant under Dario Argento and was clearly trying for an Argento style film rather than a cheap-looking, shot quickly type of film associated with his writer/producer.  Stagefright is clearly the work of someone who composed his shots very carefully and it's enjoyable to watch even when the script is less than inspired.  One example?  The killer offs someone with a giant drill which he them leaves behind.  So why don't the characters use that giant drill to drill out the lock on the front door and escape from the theater?  Only because it would have been a very short film if they had.

None of the characters in the movie does anything smart or puts up much of a fight so Stagefright is never really very suspenseful until there is only one actress left alive, but at that point the movie improves dramatically.  Stagefright's standout sequence features the actress trying to retrieve the theater's front door key which is in plain sight of the killer without him noticing.  The last twenty minutes or so of Stagefright are tense and thrilling, except for the final scene which is completely ridiculous, even for a mindless slasher film.

The disc: There are two English language soundtracks but no Italian one--this seemed annoying but I hadn't seen the movie in at least 10 years--it looks like most of the actors spoke English anyway.  The transfer looked very nice but I've never seen a Blue Underground disc that didn't look excellent.  The extras are interviews with actors, the special effects man and the guy who did the soundtrack.  They are informative and amusing if you are a fan of Italian films and want to hear stories about Joe D'Amato, Michelle Soavi (and his days as a failing actor) and about the Italian exploitation industry which was still thriving when Stagefright was made.

I would say that the Stagefright Blu-ray is a must-own for fans of Italian horror by Dario Argento and Michele Soavi and and Lucio Fulci and the like.  Fans of slasher movies in general should also seriously consider purchasing.",1414886400,7,2579,4.8807339449541285

6481913,4,B00LFN00GU,"Stagefright aka Nightmares is an Italian slasher film from 1987 about a group of actors, etc that get trapped in a theater with a killer who wears a giant owl head, a part of a costume he finds backstage.

Directed by Michele Soavi is a former assistant director to such greats as Dario Arggento,Lamberto Bava and Joe D'Amato so of course there are bound to be some of that legendary flavor in the mix.

Its suspenseful,well paced and boasts great kills with pretty amazing effects. It's gory yet classy and stylish at the same time. The kills are creative and fun to watch. The transfer is good and I was thrilled to finally find this classic on blu ray.

If you're a slasher lover and especially Italian slashers you better jump on this.",1411516800,,739,4.541353383458647

8665603,4,B00LFN00GU,"I like this movie...  It is a little goofy at times...  But overall  a solid horror movie.  I think it is inferior to La Setta, but better than all of Soavi's other movies.
The blu Ray was also a worthwhile upgrade over my older DVD version.",1449878400,3,241,4.173913043478261

8665607,4,B00LFN00GU,"It's easy to see that Mr. Soavi learned his craft from no other than Dario Argento, which is just the right person to rely on, when it comes to visceral Horror. Nice gory scenes are captured by the roving camera of Renato Tafuri, a nice score and lighning makes you sometimes feel you are actually watching an Argento film.  The italian cast sometimes overplays (especially in the more dramatic scenes) but otherwise it is a nice try to break free from the influences that Mr. Soavi was under, but still after a short film and a documantery about Mr. Argento a very decent debut.",1427155200,,579,4.5673076923076925
