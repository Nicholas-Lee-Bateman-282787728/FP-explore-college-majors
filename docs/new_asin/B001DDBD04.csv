8292775,5,B001DDBD04,"I ordered this DVD on Learning Everyday German a couple of months before my trip to Germany.  I wish I had had more dicipline in playing it more often, as it was very helpful for what I did learn.  If I planned on returning to Germany I'd start using this DVD more often and carefully, as I found it very helpful.  It was well presented and informative.",1338768000,,353,4.2388059701492535
