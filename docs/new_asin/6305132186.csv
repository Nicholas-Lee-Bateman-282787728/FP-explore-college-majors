7884109,5,6305132186,"The sequel to Jack Higgins' ""Thunder Point"", hits the deck with a narrative to introduce us to the ""Windsor Protocol""; it is a last minute Nazi plot to revive the Third Reich or set up a fourth. Mostly it is billions of dollars in unmarked accounts. The plot may hit home in strange ways. We are introduces to several characters and are forced to learn of their backgrounds slowly through the movie. However it is more natural than the Agatha Christie introductions.

We start out with an economics summit in Montral between the haves. It is being protested by the have-nots. There is a hostage situation. Retired special agent Sean Dillon (Kyle MacLachlan) is forced to quell the situation. There he learns something that starts the whole story in motion.

We get introduce to what seems to be Sean's new side-kick Lenny (Lisa Bronwyn Moore); her weapons seem to be a towel, a computer, and an antiquated pistol, in that order. Lenny is enthusiastic and clumsy but is capable of pulling Sean's bacon out of the fire.

This is an action packed movie with TV props and feel.

Kyle MacLachlan played Paul Usul Muad'Dib Atreides in ""Dune"" (1984). Lisa Bronwyn Moore on the other hand seems to be a sort of mystery with very few pictures and a skimpy biography.",1505174400,,1257,4.7
