5552911,1,B00B2203V6,"Absolutely worthless attempt at a medical horror mixed in with zombie film.  There's nothing at all to sustain your interest, shaky camera effects get tedious, so does the constant self-loathing of the characters, who can't act.  You can't hear the dialogue, and the subtitles aren't in sync with the time the characters are speaking.

Don't get sucked in by the DVD cover, which is a forgery of the superb fun Italian horror film, Demons (1985) directed by Lamberto Bava.

5552912,5,B00B2203V6,As the movie began it was a bit slow then it began to pick up as the story revealed itself you begin to think you know whats going on until the very end when the suprize twist happens. Like us you will never see this ending coming...,1366416000,5,233,3.978723404255319
5552913,2,B00B2203V6,It's pretty bad when you watch a bad movie and are not sure if it's an intentional B-movie or a poor attempt at a genuine movie.  There is really nothing much to say about this movie as the movie itself really brings nothing of interest to the screen.  Save your time and money and take a pass.,1366156800,3,294,4.140350877192983
5552914,3,B00B2203V6,"A company called Gentek is doing experiments on people. 4 people sign up for the experiment. They are:

1) William Hunter (Brandon Auret) is an ex-policeman. We later find out he has alcohol and cigarette addictions. He provides for inner conflict.
2) Jake Butler (Ryan Macquet) has brain cancer.
3) Samantha Foxx (Ingeborg Riedmaier) is a waitress with asthma.
4) Dominic Black (Michael Thompson) is the brains in the group. He is in a wheel chair.

The four are administered a drug and wake up somewhat free from their disorders. They are in a multilevel abandoned hospital type building with no knowledge as to what is going on. They are B-15 test subjects.

The subplot consists of a B-14 test subject and an intruder running around with armed security attempting to grab them. It appears the one test subject has razor sharp teeth, a killer instinct, and some type of regenerative property.

Both you and the B-15 test subjects try to figure out what is going on from the clues. To be honest, I was fooled as I went down the direction they lead me, ignoring other factors which I wrote off.

The film was interesting, but the set was dull. Even though it was a horror/action/mystery/thriller I was bored during some of the middle action. The characters were a bit lame, but later I found out that was by design. Not a bad rental. More cerebral than some horror films.

5552915,5,B00B2203V6,Don't buy this film if you're expecting a high budget Hollywood film. This movie was made for very little and is a fine example of what can be done on a micro budget. Give it a shot with what can be done with very little.,1363824000,5,221,3.933333333333333

5552922,3,B00B2203V6,"Its a bit long.  I think the movie would have worked better at about a third the length with some of the side stuff cut out.  The bit with guards and maintenance seemed excessive and pretty much dumb.  The over all story is pretty old with a twist that I didn't see coming at the end.  Nothing special, but its an ok watch.",1411948800,,323,4.079365079365079
5552923,3,B00B2203V6,"This one has a great first half that really builds the tension and the mystery. The second falls back to the old horror cliches and finally a very bizarre ending. Great acting by the main actors and the buildup was great. Really had me guessing. Then ban the whole story falls apart and your like that makes no sense at all, why would they do that, wtf are they thinking.  So so overall but worth a view if your bored.",1411776000,,418,4.225
5552924,5,B00B2203V6,"I love the premise and the camera effects were cool, the only downside was the crappy gun effects... Other than that, I'm all for survival horror, but the twist is what really got me thinking at the end. Now a days they are doing the same thing and they call them micro-humans Orwellian news speak for ""Babies"" If people thought that babies were being grown and killed for experimentation, the public would go wild, but if they call these babies ""micro-humans"" they can slide it past the dumbed-down public's attention.

5552927,4,B00B2203V6,"Really well done movie. I think it should have a better overall rating because it was a good movie with lots of twists and turns. The video quality wasn't the best but if you can look past that and you actually enjoy scary zombie type movies then you'll really like this one. The plot was great and the acting was pretty well done. This movie was good enough to watch more than once.

If you're not a horror fan and you only want to see movies with perfect picture quality then you probably want to skip it.",1404777600,8,507,4.22680412371134

5552929,2,B00B2203V6,A corporation is signing up participants for purposes unknown to the subjects. Speculation as to the purpose of the experiment makes the film somewhat interesting. Some decent acting and the setting instils an atmosphere of dread.,1401753600,,230,5.416666666666667
5552930,4,B00B2203V6,"In the spirit of 24 Days later, the infection is like a rage/insanity style virus that spreads and changes people rapidly. The clever part was the setting and the ""test subject"" style plot. I thought it was a well done gritty movie that held my interest.
The only real negative for me was the explanation at the end which really is convoluted and does not make much sense. I really did not need them to try and explain the how and why...the movie was fine without it.
If you need non stop action, full throttle...then you will not like this as it is methodical in how much action it contains until it is ready for everything to implode and hell to break loose.
It's obviously not a huge budget movie but it does well with what it has and the acting was decent in my opinion.",1401494400,,774,4.308219178082192
5552931,4,B00B2203V6,"There are quite a few movies like this on Prime-they kind of look like student films. They don't have anybody I've ever heard of and most of them are very recent. (most of them really suck too!) Thsi one is pretty  cool, about a drug company doing (illegal) experimentation on people, with nasty zombie-like side effects. There is a fair amount of character developement, and even though the whole movie was shot in an abandoned hospital (I am guessing), you really get to care about the actors.  Take it for what it is-a really low budget, possibly student, film-sit back and enjoy it. One silly thing in the movie is that they didn't bother to fix the time codes on the video cameras that show theit POV throughout the movie...according to the time codes, the whole thing happened in less than 10 seconds! Ha ha! Anyway, I liked it and would recommend it.",1400889600,,857,4.594771241830065
5552932,2,B00B2203V6,"The premise of the story is not new, but did show some signs of promise. You know its the unauthorized type of medical/military/government/private industry experiments thats hushhush and under the radar.
The stories pacing reads like an EKG strip up down up down and finally flat line. When things finally start to happen they come to a screeching halt again and the test subject conflicts start up again like a broken record.
You will get the basic idea of what the story is about as you follow along, but there is so much left out that will leave you feeling cheated after watching the entire movie. At the end they summarize the story for the viewer however while they are doing that the background music is so loud that you can't hear(at least I couldn't hear them talking) what they are saying about the experimental  trials.
The acting ranged from decent to bad which coincided with the writing and the direction in this production. If you are a fan of shakey cam work, then you'll like this movie because it has a fair amount of it. The location setting(abandoned hospital) was probably the best part of the movie. The creatures(zombies/lab rats/guinea pigs) or whatever they were make up was ok, but nothing original. There was some low level gore (severed arm, teeth, blood and gun shot wounds) effects that were above amateur, but below professionally done. The attempted kill scenes (using firearms was so anemic that I wondered why they were even used as props with between 20 to 30 rounds fired at most) were weak and not as violent as is normally seen in the zombie? genre nor was there any nude/sex scenes in the movie. There was some foul language, but again not as intense nor used as often in this genre.
This is one of those movies that some may enjoy while others can't wait until its over. I was in the latter group. To sum it up, it was a whole lot of nothing! 2 generous stars for its location.",1396137600,4,1917,4.5726744186046515

8561233,4,B00B2203V6,"This film started out a little slow paced with a bit of discomfort in the commitment by the actor's to thier roles..  Once it started to pick up, it was very interesting.  It is rare that I find something that impresses me...  something where the plot isn't cookie cutter.  I am not going to say that there were not bumps in the presentation. I would say that they ended up just a step below excellence with this attempt. This is not a blockbuster film and I don't expect it to end up with a huge fan base.  I would however suggest that it may pick up a little bit of a cult fallowing.  I have recommended it to my friends for a night when they are just hanging at home with nothing to occupy the time.",1416700800,,702,4.125
