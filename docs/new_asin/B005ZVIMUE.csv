4911494,5,B005ZVIMUE,received season 5 in a very timely manner and in good condition. enjoyed watching the series. looking foward to collecting the rest of the seasons when they come out.,1327104000,,166,4.758620689655173
4911495,4,B005ZVIMUE,"I couldn't find this on Warner's site, and quite frankly, the treatment they are giving this extraordinary show is disgraceful. I got season 5 from Amazon. Pleased that the episode titles are on the disc itself (MUCH easier to handle). Clean if simple, not the best quality ever (remastering, anyone??), but it plays and I get to see Dan (""bombinmybriefcase!"") Fielding at his best-- or worst, depending on how you look at it, haha!

I truly wish that there were extras, that someone bothered to talk to the cast, that someone bothered to bring them back together (I did see Charles Robinson and John Larroquette together on ""McBride""-- with Charles as the judge!), that there were bloopers... why is this show treated so shoddily?? But I'll take what I can get, and this is when this show was at its prime. Thank you, whoever you are, for letting it come out in any format at ALL! (But I'll always accept BETTER!!)",1326412800,22,915,4.683229813664596
4911496,5,B005ZVIMUE,This is now available at warner bros. site.  Season 4 is available there as well.  hopefully the rest of the seasons will be coming soon.,1319760000,9,137,4.44
4911497,5,B005ZVIMUE,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,,1936,5.034375

4911523,5,B005ZVIMUE,"Season 5 of Night Court is arguably one of the two best seasons.  The cast is still happy, the faces are familiar and the zaniness continues.  Harry Stone (Harry Anderson), presides over Manhattan's Court de la Nuit.  With Dan Fielding and Christine Stone (the Yin and Yang of law), Bull, Roz and Mac in the wings, the one liners fly like lies from a politicians mouth.

Only Season 4, in my opinion, had as much going for it as does Season 5.  Roz having taken over for Selma (Selma Diamond who died during Night Court's second season), the courtroom is safe.  Roz' dry sense of humor added that jen ne se quoi to the antics of the others.  Again, I feel this was taken to aid Jasmine Guy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Like-Me/dp/B00GT2TEPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Like Me</a>&nbsp;as she played meter maid cum reaper Roxy Harvey.

There are a lot of comedies out there deserving of praise.  M*A*S*H, Cheers, Seinfield and Friends come to mind.  But as a sustainable comedy without 'jumping the shark', Night Court takes the honor of Fantastic Comedy hands down (even though IMDb shows Night Court's popularity in the 600s compared to Friend's in the 60s.)",1467763200,,1218,5.168367346938775

4911526,5,B005ZVIMUE,"Love the Night Court gang! Hate that I have to buy one season at a time when I have the extra money to do so, but it is worth it when I do buy them. The first season was not as great as the other seasons but that's only because the creators were still trying to find the right character formula. Once they found that, it was amazing from then on! From the unconventional judge, the sexist prosecuting attorney, the sometimes clueless giant bailiff, the goody two-shoes public defender, the sweater-loving court clerk to the tough-as-nails, bad-to-the-bone co-bailiff, this is what sitcoms is all about! Watching this show brings back memories for me! Not just of growing up in the 80's, but of how great the TV sitcoms really were back then. Today's sitcoms has way too much dry humor that frequently gets lost on some people. This show was well written and the character chemistry is very visible.

4911555,5,B005ZVIMUE,"Night Court season 5 starts where season 4 left off Judge Christine Sullivan has gotten Harry's job back but they can't find him while Harry gears up for the prank of the century he meets a sucidal inventor who convinces him to fight to get his job back. Harry gets his job back and becomes a judge again, Christine realizes she isn't judge material and goes back to being a defense lawyer. Other highlights include Bull getting struck by lightening and thinks he's talked to God, Roz learns she is a diabetic and goes into insulin shock while Harry has to save the original draft of the US Constitution from a man with a lighter in a great 2-parter. The Night Court is once again to race through over 200 cases. This season ends in a cliffhanger where Dan Fielding who is actual in Army Reverses is given a mission at first the cowardly Dan thinks it's to a warzone, but by the time he learns what his mission is his lacky Phil bungles it and Dan is sent to remote station in North Pole but his friends learn that his plane crashed and Dan is thought to be dead.

Overall Night Court Season 5 is pretty funny, in particular: ""Ladies' Night,Another Day in the Life, Dan: The Walking Time Bomb"" my personal favorite is ""The Constitution"" parts 1 and 2 it's a real showcase Marsha Warfield and John Larroquette for both their comdeic and dramatic ablities.",1423094400,,1354,4.481781376518219

Dan (John Larroquette)is given an unwanted overseas assignment, public defender Christine (Markie Post) comes to the rescue when Roz (Marsha Warfield) has trouble with her boyfriend.

Meanwhile, Bull (Richard Moll) gets struck by lightning and thinks God spoke to him and Mac (Charles Robinson) works on curing his technophobia.

Featuring guest stars Teri Hatcher from DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, Mel Torme and Don Cheadle, these 22 episodes on 3 discs are where non-stop laughter is the final ruling.

This 1987-1988 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school and used to watch NIGHT COURT every Thursday night right after THE COSBY SHOW & A DIFFERENT WORLD and when NBC's motto was ""Come on Home to NBC"" which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1987 thru the Summer of 1988.",1392940800,,1011,4.793103448275862

4911589,5,B005ZVIMUE,Night Court was a fantastic show that has nothing to compare to it today. This is the first season where they seemed to get the cast just right and no more people are temporary.,1362528000,,177,4.235294117647059
4911590,5,B005ZVIMUE,"each season is better than the previous one.  Some of these provoke an emotional reaction getting caught up in the cast members becoming your ""friends"".",1361318400,,152,5.08
4911591,5,B005ZVIMUE,This is the one with Johny Carson and the one we were at during the taping. We are very big Night Court fans. We still enjoy the sitcom. This has to be one of the best that aired.,1361145600,,179,3.736842105263158

4911593,5,B005ZVIMUE,"It's Night Court. What more is there to say. Very funny show, you can see why John Laraquette got all the Emmies. He truly deserved them.",1359590400,,137,4.3076923076923075
4911594,5,B005ZVIMUE,"I remember watching this show every Thursday night and laughing hysterically most of the time.  Even after all these years, these DVD's made me laugh all over again.  One thing that is great about these as opposed to seeing them on tv (even though they aren't rerunning this show right now), is that you get the entire show.  Some of the scenes are deleted for commercial purposes when they air.  Waiting for the final 2 seasons to complete my collection.",1359417600,,455,4.65
4911595,5,B005ZVIMUE,"Harry Anderson and the rest of the stars of this show are great, their characterizations are great. A very funny show.",1357689600,,118,4.666666666666667
4911596,5,B005ZVIMUE,"My favorite episodes were ""Girls Night Out"" in which Christine takes Roz to a male strip club to forget about Roz's troubles, and ""Heart of Stone"" in which Harry and Dan end up on a window ledge clad in their underwear. It didn't take long for Marsha Warfield to get comfortable in her role as Roz, and this show remains one of my all-time faves.",1354320000,,346,4.338461538461538
4911597,5,B005ZVIMUE,"NIGHT COURT has always been bizarre and off-the-wall, but that's been a large part of its charm.  Season 5 is no different in this respect.  There some totally crazy moments in it, and brilliant script-writing.  We can only wish that all legal situations were this light-hearted!  The cast is superb, and it's always terrific when Dan (John Larroquette) gets his put-down.",1339027200,2,372,5.049180327868853
4911598,5,B005ZVIMUE,This was a funny TV show with some very good actors. I look forward when the rest of the seasons come out to get. I don't remember how they ended the series.,1335312000,2,157,3.9375
4911599,5,B005ZVIMUE,Season five is full of laughs and fun. Exactly what you would expect from one of the funniest comedies of the 80's.,1335139200,8,115,4.2727272727272725
4911600,5,B005ZVIMUE,I haven't seen some of these shows since I was a kid. They are still funny to this day.  Dan Fielding is still one of the best characters every written.,1332979200,5,152,4.066666666666666
4911601,2,B005ZVIMUE,"Well we got them on time and in good shape but the media couldn't be read by our DVD player!

4911603,5,B005ZVIMUE,"I've been waiting for a long time to get more seasons of Night Court and finally found season 5 on Amazon.  In spite of rumors of poor quality in season 4 (not manifest when I got it from WBStore) season 5 was good.  All episodes were there, sound and picture quality was good.  I'm happy to have the first five seasons in my library.  Now I'm waiting for more seasons to complete my collection.",1329350400,2,395,4.297297297297297

8489999,4,B005ZVIMUE,Always loved this show growing up and to me it's still as funny today as it was back then. It's nostalgic and a throw back to Thursday Night Must See TV. I think only fans that can get past the sexism and other isms will enjoy this DVD because things are said and done that were semi ok to say and do in the 80s but would NEVER be allowed today. Ex: every word and action of Dan Fielding. He'd be the poster boy of the me too movement. Just a warning for anyone not familiar with the show,1526860800,,488,3.9393939393939394

8490002,5,B005ZVIMUE,"One of my all-time favorite shows, but when is it going to be sold as a complete series?  The show ended in the early 90's, I'm saying, come on now.  $35 dollars for one season of ""Night Court"" that's utterly ridiculous.  And I can't understand what would hold the series up.  There were no music copyright issues or anything. I'm just not getting it.  I mean, ""Taxi"" and ""Wings"" etc., are all available in complete box sets for reasonable prices. What is the deal with this show?  I need answers.  Enough time has passed and enough is enough.",1513123200,,543,4.479591836734694
