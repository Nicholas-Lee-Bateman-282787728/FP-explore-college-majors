3937257,5,B002IVLWDI,Mr Chen makes this very easy to learn and the movements are good for the mature generation.  I would buy it again if necessary.  Fast shipping and reasonable price.,1275609600,,164,4.620689655172414
3937258,1,B002IVLWDI,"This is not a DVD for beginners. There is no explanation of the movements. The narration says to ""turn foot in"" but never says which foot, or what part of the foot whether it's the heel or the toes. You're just supposed to mimic the movements shown on the screen, but it's very difficult at times to see what your feet are supposed to be doing because his pants and other leg block the view. There is absolutely no explanation as to what your hands and arms are doing. In one section all the instructions are given as  ""sleep"" and ""wake up"". It's very frustrating. It's a beautiful DVD, and it's obvious that Grand Master Chen loves what he is doing, there is just no instruction, and no explanation as to what is really going on.",1272153600,31,730,4.367647058823529
3937259,5,B002IVLWDI,"After practicing Tai Chi on and off for 40 years and I've found that this is the form I always turn back to.  Grandmaster Chen's instruction in person or on his dvd is superb.  The art of Tai Chi is practical and there's no mystery.  Tai Chi gives a person a lifetime of benefit, but it does not take a lifetime to learn.  All you need is the right teacher, the Tai Chi form can be learnt in matter of months.  There might be some criticism about the camera angles, but from my opinion, there are alot worse dvds out there.  This dvd is first rate.

I always appreciate Grandmaster Chen's honest approach and I am delighted to have his new dvd.",1265932800,5,644,4.229508196721311
3937260,4,B002IVLWDI,"For those who find the DVD hard to follow, I suggest getting the companion book, ""Tai Chi Chuan; Art of the 60 Movements,"" the newer 10th printing published in 2008.

If you want to learn the more subtle ""mechanics"" of Tai Chi, attend one of his workshops.
(For example, Master Chen has not yet published his explanations of tilting and untilting the kwa)
Don't wait too long though, Master Chen is 75.",1265414400,6,402,4.583333333333333
3937261,3,B002IVLWDI,Good in that the instruction goes through both the individual stages and the whole form -  but not easy to work with a mirror image of the movements.,1265414400,4,149,4.321428571428571
3937262,1,B002IVLWDI,"The instructions on this DVD consist of a droning monotone of shift left, shift right, push here, etc.  None of the individual movements of Tai Chi are described, just ongoing narration.  Following along would be very difficult even if you were looking at the demonstrator's back, but he mostly facing forward.  And if you happen to finally connect some words and actions, the camera will move and pan, making understanding impossible again.  Avoid this DVD.  It is not useful at all.",1264636800,4,484,4.925925925925926
3937263,5,B002IVLWDI,"There were a few things about this video that people could legitamitly complain about, like the panning of the camera angles at times can make it a little more difficult to follow, but the instruction by William C.C. Chen, and the explanations on breathing, the chi, and movements really make this video great for those who are learning this form. For those who have zero martial arts history, this video may be difficult, but to those who have some understanding of Tai Chi, or Kung Fu it definitely helps. There is a loop feature that makes this video a lot easier to learn from than any other, plus his daughter and son doing the form with him during the full form feature make the video a lot easier to follow. The variety of the three's movements, with the uniformity and almost exact timing allow the veiwer to see the importance of the focus on the destination of the hands and feet rather than the arms and legs; The ability to move with the breath rather than the body. I can't give it justice with my words. The only flaws this video may have are with the filming of it, not with the info, or instruction. The flaws in filming are minor (like at times in the full form mode the cameraman may zoom in to far and cut off the movement of the feet (I think it happened twice), but it doesn't happen in the segmented parts, or looping). I highly, HIGHLY recommend this video to those who want to learn William C.C. Chens version of the Yang form.",1261699200,47,1451,4.397769516728625
3937264,2,B002IVLWDI,"Bought this because I live a LONG way from anywhere available for ""live"" classes...I liked the preview that was made available and from the ""details"" portion of the description? I THOUGHT it would contain alot of technique for actually learning some of Tai Chi's basic moves...I was looking for something low impact, slow that would help keep me limber as I have RA pretty bad. Tai Chi was highly recommended and while I still believe it WILL eventually be a part of my exercise routine? This isn't the DVD to buy for learning HOW to DO basic Tai Chi moves. I don't know if it's Master Chen's language style or what, but I simply cannot understand him. There isn't much in the way of actual ""instruction"" more of a follow along as best you can approach. I would have enjoyed the DVD more if there was a separate section with actual step by step stance and movement instruction...call me ignorant...just would have been easier for me to see someone saying ""Stand like THIS"" move slowly to HERE ...and holding the positions so a person could check for proper ""form"".  Not a good DVD for the self learner, maybe as a compliment to something else...but not a stand alone easy to understand instructional DVD",1261699200,19,1203,4.647887323943662
3937265,2,B002IVLWDI,"If you want to learn tai chi from a video, don't spend your money on this.  The movements are not fully explained and the video doesn't make sure you're able to see the relevant movements.  The forms are not explained movement by movement, but just shown and poorly narrated. For example, the very first movement is an opening step to the right, getting your feet to be parallel and open under your shoulders.  The explanation given is ""50-50,"" meaning you end up with your weight equally on both feet.  The next movement involves a kind of lifting and rolling of the hands.  The explanation: ""same weight.""  One can follow those motions without explanation because they're slow, simple and shown face-on.  As soon as there is any real body movement, the video becomes impossible to learn from. Very quickly, there are instructions like ""turn foot in,"" but one can't quite see which foot is turning, or ""step"" and you can't see which foot is stepping. There's no explanation at all of the hand movements.
If you know the form and can't find a master to practice with, I'm sure Grandmaster Chen would be a wonderful video-substitute, but this is not a video for beginners to learn from.",1260057600,109,1185,4.723300970873787
3937266,5,B002IVLWDI,fantastic update from earlier VHS when CC Che was much younger.  outstanding.  learned something new the first time I watched the video.,1458172800,,136,5.136363636363637

3937273,1,B002IVLWDI,"As far as I can tell, the instructional section on the individual movements of this are mirrored, while the ""full form"" section is not mirrored. I don't really do a lot of this sort of thing (even though my wife is a yoga teacher) but it seems ridiculous. I spent time getting comfy following the instructional sections, then when to the full-form only to find everything flipped; I now had to re-work how I was processing the video.

This may be why you see some reviews saying it is mirrored and others saying it is not.",1446508800,,522,4.4375

3937275,5,B002IVLWDI,The presentation of the topic of Tai Chi has no one more qualified than Grandmaster William C.C. Chen to teach and discuss the nuances of this wonderful art form.

3937286,2,B002IVLWDI,"While I appreciate Chen Seifu's experience and dedication to the art, I did not find this video incredibly helpful from an instructional point of view. The repetitions and the ability to loop sectons does help, but he moves through the sequences so quickly it is quite difficult to follow. His movements are quite flowing, and he obviously is quite accomplished, but it might serve those trying to learn better if the sequences were shown with movements that are initially crisp and easy to follow and then as complete flowing movement.",1416355200,,536,4.966666666666667

3937288,2,B002IVLWDI,Grandmaster Chen's technique is pure; the camerwork is wrong because it cuts of the parts of the body that should be seen to understand the sublties of the movements.  The editing was not the best as it cut to angles in between movements.,1412640000,,238,4.534883720930233

3937293,4,B002IVLWDI,"It's unfortunate that this DVD is called ""Tai Chi for Beginners,"" giving the impression that one can learn this martial art from a video.  You can't.  However, it's a wonderful supplement to instruction for beginning and intermediate students.  Here's why I would recommend it:  (1) The user has a lot of control, whether you want to practice the entire form or focus on specific postures;  (2)  Showing three practitioners makes the movements clearer; and (3) It's the authentic 60-posture form, and not just a random combination of tai chi movements (as I've seen on other DVDs).  I find it very helpful.",1375833600,2,606,4.9405940594059405

3937301,1,B002IVLWDI,"It was recommended to me that I look into Tai Chi by my doctor because of health issues (i.e., high blood pressure, etc...).  I bought a couple of Tai Chi videos from the local chain store nearby.  This video, and another beginner video with Matthew Cohen.  This video was confusing.  I couldn't understand the instructor's speech, and the camera angles changed frequently.  He seemed to say ""left"", but show ""right"", even though I tried to account for ""mirroring"".

My mom has been doing Tai Chi for years and found it confusing as well.  I tried the other video with Matthew Cohen, and it was much easier.  I understood what he was saying, and the instruction was straightforward and the sections were well-laid out in the sections of the video.

I would recommend Matthew Cohen's Beginner Tai Chi video.  It improved my physical and mental state dramatically over time.  William C.C. Chen may know what he is doing, but trying to impart that information to another was another story...I would consider myself a quick learner, but this video would take more effort than necessary to learn the basics...

William C.C. Chen video - I would NOT recommend this for beginners
Matthew Cohen video - I would strongly recommend this video for beginners",1331856000,3,1246,4.8530805687203795
3937302,1,B002IVLWDI,"Difficult to follow. William Chen does not provide easy steps to follow, and the camera spins around him, making it difficult to understand what/where to move. There are bonus features at the end, with a short clip (5 minutes) from a different Tai Chi video by another leader. His video is much easier to follow. I ended up doing that 5 minute clip instead of Chen's. I plan on selling this or giving it to Goodwill.",1323302400,3,416,4.4868421052631575
3937303,1,B002IVLWDI,"I give this DVD one star for Chen's wisdom and explanation of Tai Chi, in the bonus section and introduction. As someone who has never done Tai Chi before, I was excited to try this, and the price was right. But the explanations are just flat out missing! What am I supposed to do with my hands, other than mimic the instructor? Which foot gets moved, from the ball or the heel? Disappointing. I like a DVD where enough instruction is given that I feel comfortable not watching the screen after a few practices, I just go off of the audio cues. But with this, I am never going to get there. I was considering the Scott Cole series, and I should have stuck with that.",1312588800,4,666,4.2936507936507935
3937304,5,B002IVLWDI,"I have been doing martial arts for over 48 years, the last 32 years of which I have been practicing Tai Chi also. In 1979 I decided to add Tai Chi to my martial arts training and started learning the Yang Long form from a friend who was an instructor of Tai Chi. Unfortunately, my instructor had moved away after 3 months. I then purchased Grandmaster's Chen VHS video tape and his book ""The Mechanics of Tai Chi."" It took me about two years to learn his entire system and I continue to practice it twice every day along with other Tai Chi forms that I learned years later. When I moved to a different state, I found Tai Chi classes at the local Community College. I took their entire course--the Tai Chi long form. The majority of the Tai Chi I had learned off of Grandmaster's Chen original book and video tape were correct as my second teacher was impressed by what I knew. Grandmaster's new DVD is 1000% better then his original video tape. I am very impressed with his instructions and glad to see his son and daughter have joined him in preserving his own system of Tai Chi to pass on to future generations. If you have no martial arts or Tai Chi instruction my advice would be to look for a local community college and take a semester of Tai Chi, before you learn from the DVD. If you are lucky enough to find his book ""the Mechanics of Tai Chi,"" you definitely could learn using the DVD and book if you have the dedication. Having a Teacher is always the best way, but it is possible to learn from this DVD. I consider William C.C. Chen one of the ""Great Grandmaster's"" of our time.

3937305,5,B002IVLWDI,"I am smiling because I just had a thought about the other reviews complaining about not being to work out the exact moves: right! You can learn those anywhere, and you cannot learn them from a DVD anyway (though I agree the Terry Dunn videos are wonderful, so get those, too). But do find a teacher for direct instruction, because the details are as subtle as they are important. And start also with William CC Chen. He takes us past the cold mechanics of the form to the flow or rhythm of the form. Fall asleep, wake up. No arms, no moves. The fingers talk to the palms. The three nails. This video is priceless because it captures Master Chen's spirit and style of teaching, especially in the extra sections at the end where he just chats with us about tai chi the way he spoke to his classes. Some schools say learn the whole form first, then the flow. Master Chen takes us straight to the heart of tai chi. The locale is beautiful as are his children doing the form with him. Even the production quality is excepional.",1308182400,3,1022,4.38421052631579

A few reviews stated that the master confused between left and right in his instructions. In fact, he did not. We are supposed to look at him as ourselves in a mirror so therefore his right is our left and vice versa. He is giving the instructions for us, not for himself.
Taichi is very difficult to perform. Movements are complex. I watch a segment over and over if it seems too difficult to me. Then I use the ""loop"" feature to repeat a segment over and over and practice it with the master on the screen until I get it.
I believe taichi is difficult and requires a lot of practice ultimately. I enjoy this DVD by Master Williams Chen very much. His lessons are very useful to me.",1304380800,,797,4.28476821192053

3937312,3,B002IVLWDI,"Master Chen's Tai Chi version is impressive and interesting.  He provides history and culture of Thai Chi, music/no music and voice/no voice options, and breaks the process down into segments of practice, recommending to learn each segment first before progressing to the next.  Personally, however, I need the further breakdown into separate movements like Paul Lam does in his Qi Gong series.  Also, Master Chen seems to say ""right"" and ""left"" backwards, so I have to listen with that understanding while learning complex movements.  It is possible, but adds to the challenge of the mind's agreement with the body.",1285372800,2,616,5.191919191919192

My learning style is such that I need a sequential presentation of movement and a clear explanation of what body part is supposed to go where, and where in the body I would feel the work. This contains none of what I need as a kinesthetic learner.  If you are able to watch and do, then this could work for you. If you need small bits of information at a time, then this will not be helpful.  I passed mine on to a friend who practices karate.",1284854400,2,652,4.336065573770492

3937316,2,B002IVLWDI,"When it comes to Taijiquan, a landmark name like William C C Chen tends to carry a lot of weight. For this reason, I had high expectation when I purchased this DVD. Having been a long time player in the Taiji community as well as a senior student of the late Professor Cheng Man Ching, Mr. Chen has had an impressive track record of being a competitor, accomplished author, and a scholar. Sadly, while the DVD may be useful for a complete beginner of advanced age with absolutely no prior experience in Taijiquan, I found myself somewhat disappointed by the content, and the manner in which it was presented, considering the source.

In my opinion, Taijiquan has become a mere performance art, being presented as a choreographed form. The majority of Taiji related products approach it as a moving meditation (never quite going beyond Qi Gong elements,) lacking for the most part any explanation of individual techniques, breathing, weight distribution, and applications. While Mr. Chen's DVD does explain balance and breathing to some extent, his approach is no different from the dozens of average products already on the market, and far better material is available on the subject.

For starters, the DVD menu is divided into several sections (instructions, step by step movements, somplete form, etc) but does not have a simple PLAY function which would play the entire DVD content sequentially. I know this is a minor nit-pick, but from the perspective of an elderly viewer (I gave this DVD as a gift to my Taiji teacher,) this would make the DVD far more difficult to navigate, requiring the use of a remote which people of advanced age may have difficulty operating.

In terms of the content, I found myself quite a bit surprised at the instructions for the step by step movements. On the plus side, each set of movements is repeated 3 times, slowly, and were quite easy to follow with weight shifting instructions following each movement. The video was mirrored (left and right sides reversed) so that an average viewer could directly mimic what they were seeing on the screen rather than have to flip the movements mentally. The weight shifting and distribution were explained very well in the STEP BY STEP section of the DVD, with the names of the movements listed in the beginning. Mr. Chen's analogy of Qi, his example of a toy frog and an inflatable rubber deer (worth seeing, IMO) is definitely unique, and helps provide better understanding without getting into mystical territory (one of the reasons I loved his book, Body Mechanics of Tai Chi Chuan.) On the down side, there was no indication which movements you were performing, no indication where one movement began and another ended, and the names of the movements were limited to the text format displayed in the beginning of the STEP BY STEP segment.

The camera angle is another serious issue that needs to be addressed. While it is helpful to see several angles of the same movement to get a better understanding of what is taking place, the camera focusing on Mr. Chen would suddenly switch angle mid-movement. This caused a lot of confusion in following what exactly he was doing. A better way to handle this would have been switching angles after each repetition (there were 3 for each segment.) This would have allowed the viewer to follow the movements each time without having to pause in confusion.
What surprised me the most, was seeing Mr. Chen seemingly struggle through some of the motions during the demonstration. I realize he is advanced in age, that he went through several repetitions of the movements, and that he might be tired. However, it was somewhat disconcerting to see him have some difficulty while demonstrating movements like Snake Creeps Down, Kicking Out, and Needle at the Bottom of the Sea. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Chen and his accomplishments, however, in my eyes this was something that diminished the quality of the product considerably.

Another problem, in my opinion, was lack of direction on the proper postures and breathing during the movements. This, in my opinion, is something that is an absolute must for every beginner product, and the lack of said instruction may lead to many bad habits that may later need to be un-learned in a formal class. The information presented in the BONUS section of the DVD should in reality have been a part of the introduction, which I found lacking and uninformative.

The BONUS section covered topics like why the Taiji Quan form is performed in slow motion, what the proper ways to move are (dealing with tension, hand movement, and rooting analogies.) Again, information that should have been part of the introduction, and may have been added as a mere afterthought. What I did not see covered anywhere, is the 13 postures, which again, I feel should be required material for any beginner product, since they are very much the core of Taiji Quan. However,  this DVD seems to approach Taiji simply as Qi Gong, so information on the postures may have been left out for that reason.

What finally cemented my opinion, was the COMPLETE DEMO section with the 3 levels of instruction. This segment went through the entire motion of the William C C Chen style Taiji Quan, giving the viewer a choice of either BASIC, COUNTING, or ENERGY audio directions. While the BASIC was excellent, offering breathing, movement, and direction in which to turn (the latter being a bit more vague for beginners,) the COUNTING instructions left me scratching my head. The gist of it was a voice counting anywhere from 1-3, 1-4, or 1-5 with no discernable rhythm or explanation for the count. The ENERGY directions were merely ""fall asleep"" and ""wake up,"" again with no explanation.

I see a lot of unique and new material on this DVD that could have been implemented differently given a bit of restructuring and editing. However, in it's current state, this finished product is not particularly clear in it's overall instruction, the camera angles need better direction, and the information provided needs far more restructuring and elaboration than is provided. While Mr. Chen does insert his unique humor and personality into the presentation, it is unfortunately not enough to save this DVD from vagueness and obscurity which haunt almost every section. As such, this product fails to stand above the average book or DVD on the subject, and as I mentioned earlier, far better instructions are available.",1280534400,17,6445,4.900091659028415
