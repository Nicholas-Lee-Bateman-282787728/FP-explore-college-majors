8384472,1,B002Z6D8M4,This has the quality of a poor home video. The audio is cut up and very hard to hear. Extremely disappointed!!!,1389657600,,111,4.333333333333333
8384473,1,B002Z6D8M4,"Horrible edition and very poor image quality.. Whoever did it was definitely an amateur on the job. Unacceptable! In general, I believe that product like that should be block from any commercial activity because is very disrespectful, not only with the costumer but also with the artist.
 Where is the quality stander?",1375747200,,318,5.115384615384615
8384474,1,B002Z6D8M4,"Sadly the quality of the video (DVD) I received was so poor that even my high end Bose DVD player could not make much difference to it. I turned off the DVD at the end extremely disappointed in both quality and content. Yes I understand it is a bootleg video of a rehearsal and as such I am not expecting ""Pulse"" but come on guys, be a little more honest about the quality please. There are parts that are barely audible and others where it is truly very distorted.

Maybe I set my expectations too high",1338768000,4,503,4.239583333333333
8384475,3,B002Z6D8M4,"I bought this thinking there would be more, more camera angles, behind the scenes takes, screw ups, interviews with the band members or some cross talk with the technicians manning the controls, but it's edited down to the songs which are not complete by the way.  It's good material, don't mistake me, I like what I have...I only wish there was more to this, I'm a Pink Floyd fan after all and can't get enough of stuff like this.

The sound is spotty at some points along the video, and the shots sometimes look like they were done with a handycam but it's good anyway.

Buy only if you're a hardcore fan of the band, the video's production is not stellar

Seems to me they wanted to make a quick buck out of the hardcore fans and those unsuspect fans who might think this is something else",1278806400,8,792,4.36734693877551

The video is heavily edited to remove any talking done during a rehearsal, so you only get partial songs. They must have stopped during parts of the songs make changes, suggestions and to tweak things. It might have been more interesting to see and hear a little of that, Instead you get video of the full band playing partial songs.
The setlist and times are as follows: Echoes 11:49, learning to fly 4:30, terminal frost 2:54, sorrow 3:42, the dogs of war 5:50, on the turning away 1:21, one of these days 0:57, time 1:49, wish you were here 3:21, welcome to the machine 1:25, us and them 2:30, money 2:25, another brick in the wall (part2) 1:48, comfortably numb 2:50, one slip 1:15, run like hell 1:17
The show starts with a good rendition of echoes (one of my favorite floyd songs) minus the part where he makes screaming and screeching noises with the guitar. It is, in my opinion, one of 2 highlights in the video. the first 5 or 6 songs are shot from 1 camera, about 150-200 feet from stage and zooms in on the guys occasionally (mainly the drummer) the circular light backdrop is there but not doing much and only a snippet of video is shown on it. Meanwhile the overzealous smoke machine operator is trying to obscure the whole band and see how much they can take breathing while trying to play and sing. The lighting is dim and video is not better than b quality (what you got with the camcorders of the day) after that the video person goes down to the stage and gets some decent close ups of the guys (fun to see them looking young in that 1987 way) spotlights occasionally give decent lighting and the backdrop does a few of its computerized movements.
Then comes the only other highlight, a real nice first part of wish you were here, its a shame they didn't do the complete song, but what they did capture brought back fond memories from that tour. The rest of the songs the video person moves to the right of the stage and gets a few shots of Richard Wright (R.I.P.) and then back to the original position. They only play snippets of the final songs but you can see a dozen or so people sitting on the floor out in front of the stage obviously enjoying the taste of the tour to come. Overall the sound was pretty good, although David Gilmour did not put his whole heart into it, as it was just a rehearsal. The video is B quality bootleg that would only be appreciated by collectors.
I saw this tour and was thrilled that Pink Floyd was not dead without Rodger Waters. I was impressed with the neon glowing drumsticks during Time, the giant unfolding mirrored ball, and the incredible computer controlled backdrop, laser banks and swiveling light clusters that were advertised to have shone a light on every seat in the arena at at least one point in the show. What I didn't like was they had to stay tight to play with the effects and only had a couple of moments to improvise, which in atlanta were totally wasted, no guitar solos, no spontinaity, they relied too much on the machines they brought to provide the wow factor in the show, and probably played the songs the same way in every city. I will have to go back and watch the video of the full show ""momentary lapse of reason"" and savor it once again.",1263340800,17,3313,4.432786885245902
