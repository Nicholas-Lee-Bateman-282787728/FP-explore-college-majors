8378110,5,B002QXJLHW,"I bought the combination Practitioner and Master Practitioner course.  I did not have any problems getting my student number and password to the members only site.  They did take 3 business days to respond to my first email.  It was a little longer to respond to the second one; but they apologized and said the delay would not happen again.  The DVD has the manual and bonus material from different NLP authors, and links to other writings on the web.  The member site has the videos for many of the procedures, audios, a list of other recommended resources, and a member forum.  I have just started my journey, although I have read a lot about NLP and have several books.  This course emphasizes the experiential nature of NLP.  You can't just learn it by reading and studying -- you have to do the exercises, the observations and experience it.  I think the journey will be fun!",1282608000,2,881,4.596153846153846
8378111,1,B002QXJLHW,"I ordered this hoping for an affordable alternative to the expensive online certification programs.
You get a pdf manual and that is it. It says you get access to online videos and mp3's BUT you have to email them to get your password to get on to the site. Once you email, it says to wait 72 hours for a response. I think 72 hours is outrageous enough BUT it is not 72 hours. I have emailed for my password daily for a week and a half. I got one response asking for my Amazon invoice as proof of purchase. I sent them a copy and I have not heard back from them in days...over one week now. Do not order from Infinity Academy for anything, including life coaching. I ordered that too and have not received anything from them.
STAY AWAY from Infinity Academy.",1274745600,13,758,4.23448275862069
8378112,5,B002QXJLHW,"I have been looking into learning NLP for years and the cost has always been crippling so when I saw this product I thought, for less than a 100 bucks, it was worth the risk. I'm sure glad I did, the course is amazing!
I have been on an introduction weekend that cost me double what this course did and it was really just a 2 day advert. This is a data DVD, you get a practitioner manual that teaches you the core NLP skills and then has exercises for you to run through. There are also a lot of other documents, all designed to help you understand the main manual. On top of that they give you access to some video and audio content through an online website. It is all designed to compliment the main learning material.

The tutors are great. The downside is they do not work weekends and they do advise a 3 day turn around on emails but hey, for less than the money of a decent pair of jeans I am not going to score the guys down. They know the subject and they are all qualified trainers. The course covers everything you need in an easy to understand way and I can honestly say, NLP is a really terrific skill....or set of skills and it can make an amazing difference.

You need to be able to study and commit to this, they won't chase you and they are there for when you need them. It is also vitally important that you actual do the exercises, this is what made the difference for me. When you try NLP rather than just reading the theory, it all starts to make more sense.

I read a lot of stuff on NLP and this course has meshed it all together. I don't know how they make any cash at the price they are offering this. All I know is that it is THE BEST investment I've made and cannot recommend the course and the team highly enough.

Thank you all so much - after summer, I think the masters will be the next step. or if you ever do a business practitioner then let me know!",1266710400,2,1883,4.094850948509485
8378113,2,B002QXJLHW,"I purchased this product three weeks ago, in January 2010. I emailed the producer of this DVD to register in order to recieve my 'Free Student Number' to access online video. The people at this site have not responded. All their information on the DVD leads one to links on the Internet to read articles. If you think that you are receiving video instruction - WARNING - it is not going to happen. If you believe that you will receive personal coaching - Warning - this does not happen. I stronly recommend that people not waste their time purchasing this product, because the owners apparently do not respond to their e-mails.",1264982400,17,627,4.657657657657658
