8471411,2,B005G88LCK,"The story, in and of itself is a good one... I was always fascinated by the Miracle of Fatima.  And I longed to hear more about the two children who did NOT continue past the great Spanish Flu epidemic of 1919-1920... Little Francisco, and his sister Jacinta are true saints; and what fascinated me most about Francisco is that of all the ""seers"" he did not EVER hear the Great Lady, though he did see her.  I expected this to be some sort of re-enactment.  Instead, it is a documentary (and short one at that) narrated by some woman with a series of stills that included precious few of the actual Francisco--rather showed the boy who is portrayed as Francisco (which is why I thought it was some sort of look into his life)... in different short clips of kneeling, praying or looking up... nothing more--as the narrator goes on and on... I was pleased with how quickly it arrived, they do honor that claim--but as a quality insight into this young man's life.... look elsewhere--this is just a retelling of what 99% of those who know anything about Fatima... already know.",1458950400,,1074,4.583333333333333
