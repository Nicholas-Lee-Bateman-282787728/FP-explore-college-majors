3985627,5,B002TQKL1Q,"Becker (played by Ted Danson) is a grumpy neighborhood doctor, but his patients, office assistants and friends at the coffee shop all love him anyway.

3985667,5,B002TQKL1Q,"Haven't seen all of the episodes yet, but Becker is me! They must have followed me, unseen, at work in my ambulance for years. Thoroughly loved very episode I've seen on cable and at home.",1406246400,,188,4.4

3985670,5,B002TQKL1Q,It was even better than the actual shows and/or recording and rewatching - no commercials.  We are enjoying them almost daily.,1396396800,,126,5.0

3985672,5,B002TQKL1Q,Great Movie,1394236800,,11,5.0
3985673,4,B002TQKL1Q,"I love becker. Bought these to start my collection of 1 of the greatest & probably 1 of the most underrated sitcom.

Love the simplicity of the DVD menu layout.  Wish we had some bonus features like outtakes, behind the scenes footage, cast lives & views about the show & it's writers (who were excellent).  I hate the air-brushed pics on the packaging; It just wasn't necessary. Sir brushing isn't always a good idea.",1394236800,,418,4.621621621621622
3985674,5,B002TQKL1Q,"Can't imagine anyone not feeling warm and fuzzy after watching Becker.  I watch him EVERY SINGLE day close to turning the lights out at night because I go to sleep with a smile on my face and laughter in my heart.  I have reruns of Becker on Direct TV (Reelz channel) but I think I will enjoy viewing Becker long after reruns on TV are gone.  This series takes me to another place where laughter takes over.  If you love Becker like I do, then buy the series.  I got what I wanted from this transaction thanks to Amazon.  Whoever casted the parts did an unbelievable job. Each character is perfect and that doesn't happen very often especially with this s--- that's supposed to be comedy now.",1393891200,,692,4.409448818897638
3985675,4,B002TQKL1Q,"My husband and I have enjoyed the Becker episodes and plan to order the final 2 seasons. As many mass-produced DVD packs, the quality is not always perfect - sound and picture don't match or the picture is pixelated in spots. This problem seems endemic to the industry and the process so we  don't hold Amazon responsible and just keep watching!",1390176000,,345,4.655737704918033
3985676,5,B002TQKL1Q,Wife loves them and can play them any time she wants to with out mew watching them. Thanks you very much.,1390176000,,105,4.0476190476190474
3985677,1,B002TQKL1Q,"I purchased Seasons One thru five.  Seasons 1&2 play fine.  Seasons 3,4&5 will not load or play.  All my other DVDs play fine.",1384732800,2,126,4.391304347826087
3985678,4,B002TQKL1Q,"Never saw the show originally butn enjoyed it greatly in re-runs.  Good writing, good acting and none of the smarmy innuendo that pervades today's 'comedies.""  Recommend to fans of BOSTON LEGAL, TAXI, BARNEY MILLER.",1382313600,,215,5.294117647058823
3985679,5,B002TQKL1Q,"The adventures of Dr. John Becker, and his 'friends' make for some fantastic entertainment.  I guess in some ways Becker is the hero of every man who things the 'system' is out to get him.",1374710400,,188,4.371428571428571
3985680,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I remember watching Becker when it first aired on TV. Seeing ""Linda"" appear on Anger Management reminded me of this classic. After watching a number of episodes, I am struck by just what a smart, funny, and engaging show this really was. Too bad it did not have a stronger and a bigger following. It deserves to be up there with the classics. If you like smart comedy, well acted and delivered in a rifle-fashion manner, give Becker a spin.",1372464000,,440,4.5125
3985681,5,B002TQKL1Q,I use to watch the re-runs of Becker when it use to come on and loved it. I was disappointed when it stop coming on. I ran across this 3 pack on Amazon and had to order it. It arrived and I have been enjoing Becker every since then. This show is so funny and I never tire of it. I loved all the actors on here. Their roles worked great together. This is a great purchase and I'm glad I found it on Amazon.,1371945600,,405,3.776470588235294
3985682,5,B002TQKL1Q,"Enjoyed watching the 6 season while it ran on TV and in re-runs. Seems like some of my DR's were from his style that he portrays. And now to watch Shawnee Smith in the Charlie Sheen ""Anger Management"" series renewed my interest in watching Becker. The only downfall with Season 1 through 4 is that Seasons 5 & 6 are not available.",1369872000,,330,4.338709677419355
3985683,5,B002TQKL1Q,". . . then, this set is for you.  This is a series that continues to entertain and make me laugh time and time again.",1366588800,,117,3.68
3985684,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I absolutely loved this show; it was one of the funniest on TV in many years. Even though it is now old, a surprisingly large amount of it holds up well.",1362873600,,153,3.967741935483871
3985685,5,B002TQKL1Q,"John Becker is my kind of doctor.  He gives the straight facts, whether you want it or not, and most of the time a person could care less, but it is fun to listen to him.",1362614400,,170,3.7222222222222223
3985686,5,B002TQKL1Q,This show taught me to laugh at complaints. This doctor complains about everything but the way the show is written it never leaves the viewer annoyed by the complaints. Becker and friends are gut-busting funny. I enjoy watching this show to unwind.,1362355200,,248,4.928571428571429
3985707,5,B002TQKL1Q,I really enjoyed this DVD set.  It was hillarious and a great DVD to whine down from a bustle and hustle day.  Thanks for having it available.,1359504000,,142,4.222222222222222
3985708,5,B002TQKL1Q,"This show is simply FANTASTIC, he really tells it like it is, I've learned to speak out my mind.... Thanks Becker!!!",1347148800,,116,4.571428571428571
3985709,5,B002TQKL1Q,If you enjoyed watching Becker on TV from years ago you will remember all the programing........funny how you can remember some of the episodes from years past......sometimes his humor is dark but that's him..........,1345248000,,217,5.411764705882353
3985710,5,B002TQKL1Q,"DVD's completely sealed and in great condition but they don't work because they are in the wrong region code?? What does this mean? I am in Melbourne, Australia. How do I get them to work?",1336867200,,188,4.4
3985711,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I have been a Hardcore fan of Becker ever since it started. Dr. John Becker's Surliness, his ""Ranting & Raving"" at everyone around him. Becker reminds me of me when i complain about the little things in life. Now, to the DVD series themselves... The $64,000 Question all us hardcore Becker fans want to know is... When is the entire series coming out on DVD...??? Come on powers that be, make all us Becker fans's dreams come true...!!!",1326067200,11,436,4.602564102564102
3985712,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I love love love this series. My father in law had the first season and couldn't find the rest, I didn't realize there were only 3 seasons, which really sucks because this is so good. I'm not finished with all of them yet, but I absolutely love these characters. I found seasons 2 and 3 and snatched them up for a christmas gift for my father-in-law, who doesn't use the internet and couldn't find them. I was his favorite kid for Christmas. He absolutely loved them, and now we just borrowed, so it's the gift that keeps on giving :) I would recomend this series to anyone who wants a fun comedy to watch. Its original and fun and I love every minute of it.",1325635200,3,658,4.272
3985713,5,B002TQKL1Q,We gave this as a gift to my dad for Christmas along with According to Jim and Home Improvement. He is very satisfied as Becker is one of his favorite shows and he watches these discs every day,1325548800,,193,4.105263157894737
3985714,5,B002TQKL1Q,One of the best sitcoms of all times with some memorable one liners. I had fun rewatching all the episodes again. I'm waiting for season 4 and 5.,1323734400,,145,4.214285714285714
3985715,5,B002TQKL1Q,"It was shipped to me on time, the price was excellent.  I love watching it.  I recommend Becker for anyone that wants a good laugh, really three seasons wasn't enough.  The deal was excellent buy through Amazon.com.",1323388800,,215,4.756756756756757
3985716,5,B002TQKL1Q,We have purchased these DVD's from another supplier in the past but the quality was not good.  The DVD's we obtained from Amazon are excellent and of the highest quality and of course the series was just brilliant with  Ted Danson absolutely nailing the role.,1314403200,,259,4.733333333333333
3985717,5,B002TQKL1Q,I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 9 dvd's. The quality of these dvd recordings is excellent. A must have for 'Becker' fans.,1313712000,,123,4.904761904761905
3985718,5,B002TQKL1Q,I just happen to be part of the medical profession and I find Dr Becker very entertaining. The dialogs contain intelligent jokes & clean fun. I am glad that I was able to get a hold of the three seasons. DP,1310688000,2,206,4.048780487804878
3985719,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I agree with the last reviewer. Where is the announcement for season 4? If CBS Paramount is preparing another multiple season set containing the last 3 seasons, that would really make my year. I doubt it but a guy can dream. Please release the remaining seasons!",1296777600,2,262,4.717391304347826
3985720,5,B002TQKL1Q,Why the wait on releasing the next 3 seasons of this series? Anyone know the details?? There seemed to be a season released once a year but now nothing on a release date for season four or any of the others.,1294876800,2,207,4.073170731707317
3985721,5,B002TQKL1Q,"This was a gift for our son-in-law. However, he was kind enough to let us watch it with him. The episodes were funny, of course, and the quality of the DVD's was excellent. He was thrilled with his gift.",1294790400,,203,4.230769230769231
3985722,5,B002TQKL1Q,"this has to be my favorite show of all time (not counting muppet babies and the smurfs, early years.)  ive looked for it elsewhere, and it's $120 PLUS shipping.  those places don't even give the option of people selling it used or new.  *sigh*  amazon is great.

this show is funny and at times really teaches moral/life lessons, but not in a cheezy 'ripping off charles dickens' kind of way.  it really is great, and not r rated or anything.",1292457600,3,442,4.4625
3985723,5,B002TQKL1Q,"When I need a laugh or a change from the ordinary I watch an episode of Becker. This series is possibly the best role ever played by Ted Danson in a Series. The main character is an MD by the name of John Becker who burned out on the intellectual Research scene and wanted to go back to the Basics so he opened his own practice in the Bronx and what hijinks this cast can get into! Becker is a Harvard Medical school grad who is long on smarts but short on patience and tact and can he ever get into a mess! Becker lives life on the lean side but he is generous with the cracks. It would be wonderful if the last few seasons would be put on DVD so I guess we will have to wait on that too, this set is a good buy as It was greatly awaited!",1292371200,4,739,3.8366013071895426
3985724,5,B002TQKL1Q,"When there is nothing on worth watching, which is frequently, it's Becker Time! This is one of those series where everything worked. Perfect cast. Perfect scripts. Everything. I wish they were still on but at least they are on dvd. I highly recomend Becker, the series. Good clean fun yet addressing issues that surround us everyday.",1289692800,21,333,4.964285714285714
3985725,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I have always loved the Becker show. It always makes me laugh. I was glad to find the series on DVD. I usually watch the old reruns on cable, but recently they have stopped showing them except about once a week, like at 2 A.M. I wish the other three season were on DVD. I highly recommend this to Ted Danson fans!",1287100800,9,313,4.064516129032258
3985726,5,B002TQKL1Q,"I have to admit I have not watched every epiosde of all three seasons yet but so far I am thrilled with the set. I wish the whole series was available as it would be nice, and probably more economical, to purchase the series as a set. The three season pack was nice though and I hope the rest of the series is offered in similar packs as I will purchase the remaining seasons as they become available. Some people may find the filming a little ""grainy"" but I don't think this is the video quality; I have watched it on the channels where it is in syndication and it looks the same so I think this is the way it was filmed originally-just not that crystal clarity that we are used to with most things now. Overall an excellent set.",1274400000,13,730,4.184397163120567
