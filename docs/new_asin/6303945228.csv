This VHS is obviously a copy of a copy.  It is recorded at the slowest (poorest quality) video speed.  The image is very contrasty, i.e. blacks and whites but most of the mid-tones are no longer there.  If, like me, you may have wanted a better copy than the VHS recording from an unknown broadcast many years ago, this product is not the answer.
