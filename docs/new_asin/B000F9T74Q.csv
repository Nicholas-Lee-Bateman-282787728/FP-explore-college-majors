8119662,2,B000F9T74Q,"Melissa (Shannah Betz, Shana Sosin) has been haunted by the demon Hellinger (Wayne Petrucelli) who is basically Pin Head without the pins. Don't want to get sued on their budget. Hellinger seems to have a things for eyes, apparently the only special effects props that were on sale. Melissa is involved with a cult group. Meanwhile there are some horrible killings going on in town. Her tattoo cousin Kendall (Artie Richard) is investigating them. The acting is fairly sad with some people playing caricatures of stereotypes with trite dialouge. About 2/3 way through the film Kendall gives us an explanation of Hellinger, or you can read Amazon's ""plot spoiler"" description of the film, which like rancid meat, is tough to spoil.

The film does have some camp value and an extended love/nude scene with Shannah Betz.
