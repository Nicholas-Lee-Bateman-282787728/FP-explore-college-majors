8036687,5,B00061Q8SG,"Vicious little spy B-movie. I first caught this on a Late-Late Show on Chicago's WGN Channel 9 in the mid-1980s, back when broadcast channels would run practically anything to take up time in the middle of the night. I was blown away by this flicker. What a nasty piece of work. Lee Van Cleef has never been more evil, Patrick McGoohan never more stoic and troubled. Small, claustrophobic, violent, and cynical, this is one of my favorite genres: a super-smart B-movie with a lot on its mind.

I'll never forget the mutual destruction at the end, and the final gunfight: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Really hair-raising and shocking. I've never minded the framing device of narration in the church; it seems appropriate.

I'm also totally convinced a certain James Bond movie completely ripped off the booby-trapped English Country House from this obscure, but super-smart little flicker.",1431216000,,877,5.041379310344827
