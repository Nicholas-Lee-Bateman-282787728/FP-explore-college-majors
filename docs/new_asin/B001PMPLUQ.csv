8333874,4,B001PMPLUQ,"this little opus was part of the commmitment bela lugosi had with sam katzman's unit over at monogram pictures. it's one the more rare monogram films that is not as seen like "" the corpse vanishes"" or ""bowery at midnight""and no it's not a sequel to bela's ""the ape man"" and not one of his classics, but don't let that rub you the wrong way, it's a fun filed ecursion into late night madness. for instance you have john carradine giving his all as the  good mad scientist, while bela gives his as the baddie.you have frank moran as the apeman (looking more like a ally oop caveman, sans his club) and as the story goes george zucco almost had the honors of playing the apeman (he still receives billing) but apparently decided to say that he was too ill to go through with the assingment and was replaced . there's some speculation that they might have used some still shots and breif footage of zucco in the film ,but that's in dispute.the caveman or apeman is freed from his icy tomb, thanks to bela and john, you see they're experimenting with thawing out long frozen beings to see if they can revive them, in order to walk the earth once more..ther's a great scene in which the apeman escapes from his labortory jail to check out the modern action in the big city. you see him going through the window and for a few seconds you can see that under his animal skin pullover he's wearing modern underpants while bela, wearing a tuxedo is chasing him with a blow torch. that' the kind of fun that you'll enjoy in owning this modest little gem. with all the sick and gory horror films that seem to saturate our market today, it' simply refreshing to have this one avaible to fufill our late night showings.......",1255478400,2,1710,4.445859872611465
8333875,3,B001PMPLUQ,"In 1953, at age 4, I watched ""Return of the Ape Man"" on television with my father, who at the time was a TV and Broadway actor. As we watched, my dad (perhaps to keep me from becoming too scared) explained to me how they did makeup, staged fights, and so on. Perhaps for that reason, I always had a warm spot in my heart for this admittedly horrible movie. However, though later I looked for it on TV, it never seemed to play, and I was disappointed that it never appeared on VHS (that I know of). I began to wonder whether a copy even existed.

So when I saw this DVD, I just had to get it. The print is hardly sharp and clear, but it does appear to have been given something of a restoration; there are no distracting artifacts. The sound is weak. The film itself is about as budget as you can get, even for a wartime Bela Lugosi flick that often makes no sense at all. When Bela and John Carradine revive a prehistoric man they find in the ice, instead of trying to communicate with him and just maybe make something like friends with him, they immediately hustle him into a jail cell. And when the Ape Man gets loose, he--oblivious to the automobiles and skyscrapers around him--seems to be drawn to molesting the good-looking ""dames"" he encounters on the street. But it's kind of fun in a crazy way.

My Dad is visiting next month. I plan to watch ""Return of the Ape Man"" with him and then put it away for another 55 years.

""The Invisible Ghost"" is not the worst movie in the world, which is saying something considering that many of Bela's wartime movies have been called just that. This mildly interesting if preposterous movie is also somewhat remarkable in that the black butler is fully competent, speaks standard English, and gives intelligent, straightforward answers that confound the wisecracking police detective who is questioning him. In fact, the butler seems the only normal person in the picture, very unusual in a time when black characters almost always played the comic relief.

One other thing: this DVD has bare-bones packaging and labeling, as if somebody had gotten ahold of a 16-mm print and sent it off to some DVD service to get copies made.",1239753600,5,2172,4.50507614213198
8333876,5,B001PMPLUQ,"This is a great double feature of classic Lugosi. -The Return of the Ape Man- has Bela acting out his mad scientist side as he tries to give a defrosted caveman a more modern brain by using his assistant's (John Carradine) brain. Bela's web of horror backfires on him sadly.
-The Invisible Ghost- has Bela as a sleep walking killer whenever he sees his wife's ghost. In a particularly creepy scene, Bela uses his jacket to kill a victim. Great stuff. A fun double feature to watch with the lights off!",1237680000,2,501,4.516483516483516
