1399292,3,B000056PPJ,"I remember seeing the original Experince movie when it first came out in 1968 and I'm sure it was much longer then. It seems to have been edited down by the Hendrix Estate which is a big pity. I'm not sure if any of the music has been cut but certainly some of the interviews are missing, particularly the unique Cynthia Caster Plaster interview. I wish I could find out the length of the original movie but unusually imdb.com does not have a lot of detail on this. Anyway, a unique record of how people saw Hendrix at the time in the Sixties. Better than Rainbow Bridge. But not as good as the Warner Bros Jimi Hendrix movie.",998265600,2,626,4.313559322033898
1399293,5,B000056PPJ,"I had to have this DVD.
I'd never seen any of the extra footage on this disc before. It's a shame the Popside guitar mix is a little quiet but it's a great performance.
The Swedish show is outstanding even if you only watch Jimi. I'm not sure why, maybe he forgot his guitar but Hendrix plays a white Gibson SG for two numbers, Red House and Sunshine of your Love. It's really interesting to watch Hendrix's face as he struggles with the new guitar. Constantly fiddling with volume and tone controls it's almost like he'd never played an SG before! Red House is a great version but it's blemished by Jimi's unfamiliarity with the instrument and his resulting frustration. But what an oppurtunity for fans! The look on his face! It's similar to Woodstock in many ways. A brilliant player who's having a bad day but occasionally shines.
Occasionally shines? Okay, occasionally doesn't shine.
The Dolly Dagger video is pretty cheesy. Some woman painted up like a hooker for some no-talent film makers. Watching Jimi step out of the ice is cool though.
When oh when will they do the Hendrix catalog justice?",985564800,8,1103,4.690721649484536
1399294,5,B000056PPJ,"All I can really say is I enjoy this DVD a ton.  I've watched it a few times already and I'm not bored of it. You know how it is with some music/concert DVDs, you watch it once (maybe twice) and just put on the shelf to be forgotten (at least until you sell it back or trade it). It's got really great footage (some stuff I've never seen before and looks amazing) and it has a nice menu that makes it easy to enjoy. I would put this title as a must own for a Hendrix fan (or just a fan of great music) and not just archive freaks.",984960000,4,530,3.8181818181818183
1399295,4,B000056PPJ,"EX-ARMY AIRBORNE, ELECTRONIC BLUES PLAYER THAT I'VE EVER MET."" (NR?)
Frankly, I was disappointed with the sound quality the most and also the picture quality of this DVD, however; I told myself to be THANKFUL for ANY Jimi I can get! He is GONE and I should CHERISH this--and I do! I wish he was still here with us today! Think how amazing that would be!
Included on this DVD is:
EXPERIENCE: [Color] Includes live performances and rare footage. It has ""Purple Haze"", ""Wild Thing"", a photo session with Jimi, Noel and Mitch, a short video of Indians with comments by Jimi, Jimi answering short questions of Mitch and Noel (particularly humorous is Jimi's pet peeve about gimmicks), ""Foxey Lady"" video, Jimi skydiving and Jimi describing his feelings of it, and it ends with ""Hear My Train A Comin'.""
POPSIDE: [Black & White] Stockholm, Sweden May 24, 1967. Jimi performs in studio for a Swedish Television Program. This section of the DVD has more closeups of his fingering, much better picture and somewhat better sound quality than EXPERIENCE (above.) He plays ""The Wind Cries Mary"" and ""Purple Haze."" POPSIDE is an awesome clip!
NUMBER NINE: [Black & White] Stockholm, Sweden January 9, 1969. ""Time for some electric church music..."" says the announcer. This is definitely my favorite section of the DVD. Jimi plays ""Red House""--it is an amazing performance of the song with much improved and diverse camera angles. The angles include closeups of each player, of all three, plus priceless closeups of Jimi's fingering and full body angles! Jimi goes straight into ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" and it is awesome too! This and the other Swedish performance, POPSIDE, are worth the purchase price of this DVD in my opinion! DIG!
OLYMPIA: [Color] Paris October 9, 1967. An incredible performance of ""Wild Thing."" What can I say? GROOVY!
""HEY JOE"": ORIGINAL PROMOTIONAL FILM [Color] January 1967. Not a lot of lighting on but this has a much better picture quality than some clips on this DVD. I have always loved this song.
""DOLLY DAGGER"" [Color] 1997 Music video with Fawn Reed and James Hong. I liked this but especially the ending! WOW! You have to see this!
All in all, I think you should enjoy this if you are a big fan as long as you are forewarned of the sound and picture quality which are no better than average (I am being generous here.)",984096000,13,2340,4.780246913580247
1399296,1,B000056PPJ,"This DVD was a big disappointment. The only good track is ""Hey Joe"". Everything else is very bad. There are other bad Hendrix DVDs but this is the worst. If you want Hendrix on DVD, buy ""Woodstock"", ""Monteray Pop"" or ""Band Of Gypsys"". I'm trading in my copy soon.",982627200,,263,4.387755102040816
1399297,4,B000056PPJ,"The Experience film is none too impressive, but certainly worth viewing for its live performances and amusing commentary. The sound is just weak and the image unclear. The extras featuring Jimi are marvelous--Stockholm, ""Hey Joe"" promo, ""Wild Thing"", and Popside are all worth your money and time. But the film that the DVD is really selling isn't nearly as good as the longer and better looking bonus features. Hendrix was probably the best guitar player in the world at this time, but it may take WOODSTOCK or JIMI HENDRIX to prove that to you.",1116633600,2,546,4.819148936170213
1399298,3,B000056PPJ,"Step Inside to a journey of well organized live performences, as well as rare interview footage. This DVD would be more appreciated by a hendrix collector since this is all rare footage, and interviews. This only runs forty minutes long of rare and previously unreleased bonus material. I was disapointed that the hendrix family coperation released this film in such poor manor expesically the Hey Joe(promotional film), and the music video featuring Fawn Reed, and James Hong's Dolly Dagger. Those two sections of the DVD are really bad just to mention. The good footage includes never before seen live performences including Popside, Stockholm's Wind Cries Mary, and Purple Haze.

Also the Stockholm, Sweden 1969 performence including a very long Red House, and Sunshine Of Your Love. Their is also a performence at Olympia, Paris titled Wild Thing. I think this is an average take your money DVD expesically from the company Experience Hendrix im sure many hendrix fans have this one but all the first time hendrix listner's probaley would never think about buying such a short DVD of unreleased material. I really had to push myself to buy this one since I thought it really was not worth buying. But since I love hendrix's music I had no problem with this Experience Hendrix DVD. If you really want a good Hendrix DVD look elsewhere!!!!",1094860800,5,1341,4.96
1399299,4,B000056PPJ,"EXPERIENCE HENDRIX,
  THIS IS AN OK DVD I DONT LIKE THE FACT THEY ADDED AN VIDEO OF HEY JOE AND DOLLY DAGGER THAT MADE THE DVD WORSEN. THE BEST HIGHLIGHTS FROM THIS DVD HAVE TO BE ALL THE CONCERT MATERIAL SOME OF IT IS RAW LIKE IN THE BEGGINING WHEN THEY PLAY PURPLE HAZE BUT IT GETS BETTER WHEN HENDRIX AND THE EXPERIENCE PLAY RED HOUSE IN SWEDEN AND SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE. THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED THE FULL CONCERT INSTEAD OF CLIPS FROM THE CONCERTS. I RATED THIS 4 STARS ITS OK FOR ME IT WAS NOT A MUST HAVE HENDRIX RELEASE BUY IT AND YOU SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT.",1067731200,2,560,3.9910714285714284
1399300,5,B000056PPJ,"Peter Neal in his late teens was quiet and prescient. As a guitarist with Dave Butcher: banjo and Charlie........:fiddle playing Old Time Country music in the pre rock years attracted more humour than appreciation at a time when there was no Lynard Skynard or Jackson Brown. Early films such as ""In the wake of the Parsley Tree"" pre-dated ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""
by some twenty years. The eclectic and patchy nature of this video set a marker for current TV realism. This piece is real history and should be examined as such.",1060473600,,535,4.702127659574468
1399301,4,B000056PPJ,"Don't get me wrong -- I loved the original ""Experience"" movie, back when it was available on VHS. But I expected great things with its move to DVD -- the quality of the sound of this release is clean, but the video quality of the first 25 minutes is somewhat grainy and disappointing.
My favorite section of this DVD is the ""Number 9"" Swedish performance. It's in stellar quality -- I really wish that more of this show (all of it?) could have made this disc...given that there was plenty of room to add more 'filler'.
The worst track  (for me) was Jimi miming 'Hey Joe'. Sure it's cool to see, but once was enough for me. The ""Dolly Dagger"" video is tolerable, but I'd have preferred another concert clipping instead.
The one positive note I should make, is that the version I purchased (through Bogus Buy) included two additional tracks from Jimi's forthcoming ""Blue Wild Angel"" DVD -- ""All Along the Watchtower"" and ""Spanish Castle Magic"".",1036972800,7,942,4.640718562874252
1399302,4,B000056PPJ,"I myself am a collector; I own over 85 videos from Beatles to The Who to... well, just about every band in the history of rock and roll.
As a fan of Hendrix, this video, a mere 69 minutes in length, was sloppy, disorganized, random bits of footage that seemed to come out of nowhere.
As a collector, I enjoyed very much of it.  The Dolly Dagger video alone was worth the price, plus to finally see the 1969 Sweeden concert was really cool.
I would suggest that they make a film documenting Hendrix' entire life, like ""The Definitive Elvis"" or ""Beatles Anthology.""  That way, we not only see the film clips, but we get a better understanding of how everything fits together.
All in all, I'd say it has a lot of material that a collector would enjoy, but as a fan, I enjoyed ""Jimi Plays Monterey"" more.",1036972800,13,800,4.3624161073825505

I wish that it were longer though. with all the unrealesed footage that Experience Hendrix has laying around, who knows what they're gonna come out with next? I wish that they would release the entire Berkeley concert on Dvd now that would be awesome! Berkeley to me was one of Jimi's best shows. But of course on Johhny B. Goode, They just had to edit it when Jimi was playing with his teeth and that to me is a NO NO!",1036627200,,534,4.144230769230769
1399304,2,B000056PPJ,"This DVD is carelessly shot, often focussing on Jimi's face rather than his entire being.  Show us his hands for crying out loud!  That's where the action is.  There is a really awkward version of Red House that the band performed at the height of the Jimi-Noel fights; the performance is capped by Jimi and the band walking off the stage in disgust.
There are definately more interesting and entertaining Hendrix performances available, so check those out.",1015113600,3,457,4.909090909090909
1399305,4,B000056PPJ,"This is a great video, and has excellent performances all around except for Noel.  Time and time again, Noel just doesn't work.  He isn't involved in the song the same way Jimi or Mitch are.  I mean, that is one ...bass solo during the seemingly 40 minute version of ""Sunshine Of Your Love.""  While doing his ""solo,"" Noel pauses and SCRATCHES HIS NOSE.  COME ON, WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!  Jimi should have thrown him off the stage, or gotten a bass player that puts his playing before a scratch he had on his nose.  Noel's backing vocals are also whinny and raspy.  Let Mitch take some of the vocals (if he's not scratching his nose).  So in short, Jimi and Mitch are spectacular, but Noel is enough to give this excellent collection four stars.",1000684800,3,740,4.503759398496241

Be forewarned: the ""Dolly Dagger"" video is revolting. Insipid. Pitiful. Why Hendrix Experience LLC authorized this is beyond my understanding.",1256947200,,333,5.166666666666667
7932525,5,B000056PPJ,"this dvd begins with the half-hour documentary ""Experience"" filmed in 1967 at the height of this new phenomenom everybody was talking about at the time, Jimi Hendrix and his band The Jimi Hendrix Experience. The film integrates live performances with interview segments and a promo clip for Foxy Lady(a foxy lady named Beth wrapped in a fox fur, a mini skirt and white go-go boots runs hither and thither...sort of like a fox being chased by the hounds, all to the tune of FOXY LADY)as well as Jimi by himself with just a 12-string acoustic guitar performing a very bluesy ""hear my train a-comin"". this last solo performance is also seen in the film ""Jimi Hendrix"".
it's great to hear Jimi reflect on what it was like as a paratrooper during his time in the service and his thoughts on native American indians. the two live performances from Blackpool England show just what a showman Jimi was as he plays his guitar behind his back, between his legs, rolling on the floor and playing his guitar with his teeth after which he teases the audience with ""what are you looking at!!??"".
This is Jimi just having a great time showing exactly what he can do with his guitar to stunned audiences. He introduces the song Wild Thing by asking everyone to all sing along and if they don't ""we're gonna put a curse on you and all your children that they be born completely naked"".
Following the ""Experience"" film are 2 black and white clips from Swedish  television with jimi and band lipsynching(i think) to Wind Cries Mary and Purple Haze. very nice.
Next up is the main course of this disc. After seeing this i went out and bought this DVD. It is a live performance from early 1969 with the Experience performing in Stockholm Sweden. Introducing the band, the emcee informs the audience that the band will be performing what they like to call 'electric church music'....and out they come. After a smattering of applause the room becomes very quiet as Jimi plugs in and begins a long exploratory improvisation on the song Red House. You can see instantly that this is no longer the flashy entertainer who a few years earlier would stun the audience with teeth picking and speaker cabinet humping. Instead, we see a Hendrix who looks like he just go out of bed and is all business as he acquaints himself with the Gibson SG he's using this night instead of his trademark Fender Strat. This is the most interesting performance i've seen of the man....watching him trawl through this set as if he were a scientist in his laboratory, first with Red House and then a long jam to a vocal-less Sunshine of your Love that includes a very unexpected Noel Redding bass solo. Buy this DVD for this live footage alone. Well, that's what i'm doing. but after the red house performance there is also the promo clip for the song Hey Joe and another live performance from Paris, 1967, with the band doing another take on Wild Thing. the program concludes with a posthumous video of the song Dolly Dagger that i notice a lot of reviewers seem to shun. I guess i can see why. it comes off as a marketing ploy but i got past that and enjoy the song and the choreography set to it. and the gal in the video, Fawn Reed ain't half bad either!
overall, i recommend this nice lil' disc. it's a really good sampler of a shooting star-Jimi Hendrix",1179532800,2,3311,4.555369127516778
