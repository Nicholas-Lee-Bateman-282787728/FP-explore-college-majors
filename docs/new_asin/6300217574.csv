7806412,5,6300217574,This is very early Howie Mandel but some of his best work. Absolutely hilarious. I've watched it many times and it's still funny.,1381795200,,129,4.6521739130434785
7806413,4,6300217574,"If your VCR still works, I highly recommend this Howie Mandel video.  It's from the 1980s when he was at his peak for stand-up and improv.  Most of the show is spent interacting with the audience, and you can see how quick Howis is on his feet.",1350345600,,244,4.170212765957447
7806414,5,6300217574,"The quality of the product was better than expected. I remember watching this as a kid and now that I have it, I feel I've gotten a piece of my childhood back. I have told EVERY member of my family about the great price and where to find it. They will be shopping soon!",1304380800,,269,4.0
7806415,5,6300217574,"If you enjoy zany, off the wall, non-stop hillarity, then purchase this video! Yes I did say video, unfortunately this special never made it to DVD. Still worth what you will pay for it!",1279497600,,186,4.5
