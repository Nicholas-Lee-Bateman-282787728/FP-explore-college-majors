8084916,5,B000BC8T4Q,Great. My friend Marius BECKERS were on that day 1969 November in Kopenhage and could be present at this concert. Fabulous ! Thanks a lot for your shipment,1463875200,,155,4.571428571428571
8084917,5,B000BC8T4Q,"Everything you would expect from a Duke Ellington with a band that headlines Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves, Harry Carney, Russell Procope, Cat Anderson, Cootie Williams, Lawrence Brown. Et al.",1446076800,,192,5.655172413793103
8084918,5,B000BC8T4Q,A live performance with a loving Danish audience. This goes by far too quickly but if you never saw Duke live then this is as close you will get. I saw him live many times and this is well worth having.,1432339200,,202,3.951219512195122
8084919,5,B000BC8T4Q,The Duke could play the NYC phonebook and be superb! ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING presentation! The total pro.,1428105600,,104,5.5625
8084920,5,B000BC8T4Q,"I have to admit I'm totally biased, I saw this band in Sydney Australia as part of the Duke's 70th BD tour (and again a few years later but not nearly so exiting, maybe cause as the stage was in the round, the old timers couldn't wonder off/on stage as they liked or fall asleep on stage!).  I have had the album for a long time, know it off by heart and Rufus Jones is one of my favorite drummers. I'm grateful and I think were lucky someone had the good sense to film this and make it public. The camera work is a bit frustrating early in the performance but it gets better.  Some beautiful piano playing and wonderful to see the band close up.  Legendary stuff which every pupil of good music should be aware of at least.  Interesting to see how much the 'arrangements' for each song changed from performance to performance, giving it a very loose but structured feel. If you like this genre, Duke, you won't waste your money.",1376956800,,929,4.32183908045977
8084921,4,B000BC8T4Q,"The Tivoli DVD from 1969 is not nearly as good as the one from the Jazz Icons series, Live in '58.  Duke himself is in great spirits, but the Tivoli concert was not a particularly memorable one.  The organ of Wild Bill Davis adds a fresh flavoring to several tunes, and the quartet encore of ""Black Swan"" with just Davis, Duke, Victor Gaskin, and Rufus Jones is a highlight.  Other high points are a drum solo feature by Jones,and an appealing performance of La Plus Belle Africaine.  The ""wailing interval"" of ""Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue"" is shared by Paul Gonsalves, Norris Turney,and Harold Ashby. Excellent camera work makes this an intimate viewing experience.  But buy Live in '58 before Tivoli.",1316131200,3,707,4.809917355371901
8084922,5,B000BC8T4Q,"For true Ellington fans this is the last ""authentic"" Ellington Band. Because Johnny Hodges is still sitting center-stage - playing the same pivotal role he immediately assumed when joining the Duke 50 years earlier as a 22-year old. It has another huge bonus, the unusual addition to the band of Wild Bill Davis, who of course was responsible for giving Hodges's Verve recording career a huge boost when they first joined forces in 1961.

The other pleasure to be gained from this DVD is one can SEE what can only be imagined listening to the recordings made 26 days later at concerts in Manchester. Issued by United Artists as ""Duke Ellington's 70th Birthday Concert"". These latter concerts were a lot more lively due to the enthusiastic Mancunian response to the faster numbers - especially Satin Doll - but in essence it's the same program with some minor omissions.  Notably no vocals from Tony Watkins, no Tootie for Cootie and no medley.

The big bonus is to SEE the legendary sax section in extreme close up.  Is there a more beautiful sight in music than a side view of 5 gleaming gold saxophones being played in unison?  The real force behind the  ""Ellington effect"".  Being short one trombone there were in fact 6 saxes. The sixth Rorris Turney, coming forward for a tenor-sax duel in In Triplicate (as it was later named) and seeming to win (where non-breathy sound is concerned).

Although the cameras do occasionally miss filming whoever is taking a short solo this DVD replicates exactly what one would see and hear if sitting on stage - as I did at the Royal Festival Hall in the late 50's - when the Musicians Union finally allowed Duke to tour Europe again.

The high point of every concert being when the magisterial Johnny Hodges performed his 3 number melodic magic. In this instance especially poignant as he was to die 6 months later.  But here he is clearly enjoying the camaradie of the greatest sax section in the history of jazz. Especially happy beside Russell Procope - who plays a great solo in 4:30 Blues.  Lastly, there is a wonderful low key encore with Wild Bill and the Duke enjoying a respectful low key duet on Black Swan.  Showcasing their mastery of the tonal possibilities of a Hammond organ and a grand piano

The thought occurs why would this band, half of whom were well over 60, spend a month criss-crossing Europe in chilly November?  Requiring long and short flights, being transported from cold exteriors to over-heated interiors (in this concert sweating under TV lights) etc.?

This DVD provides the obvious explantion.  As can be seen from their demeanour none of these musician/virtuosos would choose to remain relaxing at home when offered one more opportunity to be on the road ""doing their thing"" before appreciative audiences who fully understood the artistic and historic role Duke Ellington played in making jazz America's greatest contribution to world culture.",1252713600,3,2918,4.852822580645161
