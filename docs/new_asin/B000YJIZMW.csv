8233052,1,B000YJIZMW,"I watched this movie as I thought I would learn someting (like I did with so many other massage videos).
This one was absolutely terrible and is NOT worth the money at all.
I am not actually sure what this technique is but it is not Tui Na. I have done several semesters of study of Acupuncture and Acupressure but this is not useful at all, not even for a student.
The movie was very poorly presented by the massage therapist blocking the view on occasions when doing work on the head plus the moderator appears to have problems speaking. His voice is so forced and makes it an unpleasant experience overall.
Very disappointed and would not recommend this video to anyone.",1271376000,5,673,4.524590163934426
8233053,1,B000YJIZMW,"I purchased this video and watched it and thought...what the heck it that?
Then I went to China to study Tuina and there is no comparison to this Massage Nerd Tuina Video and the actual Chinese Tuina techniques.  Please do not buy this.  His techniques are not Tuina.",1227830400,6,267,4.541666666666667
8233054,5,B000YJIZMW,Wow! It looks like Virginia Chang is promoting her school through Amazon. I thought it was great and I learned so much.,1211241600,2,119,4.454545454545454
8233055,1,B000YJIZMW,"A better DVD could be made on tuina. The treatment method/technique for lower back pain is not accurate. The model/patient/client should be in the prone position, not with the massage therapist/acupuncturist standing behind the client while the client is sitting on the table. This could be perceived as harassment. This is not the way we do it. Unless you want to do the thing that the chiropractor in NJ who convinced himself that massaging his female patient's frontal areas would help her with her post-surgical lower back surgery and got arrested May 2008, then you go right ahead. This is just to let you know that in Brooklyn, if any so called "" massage therapist"" tried the same technique in treating a female client by standing in back of her while her Italian husband or boyfriend is in the room, the massage therapist will not be standing for much longer.  Oh, I forgot that some people with only a high school education would choose massage therapy as a "" profession"" so they can legally grope their clients. President -- Brooklyn Institute of Massage Therapy..( Brooklyn, New York .  USA) Oh, P.S.  did not learned anything from this DVD. P.S.S. Not one of the ""licensed massage therapists"" who got their licenses revoked in the great state of New York for misconduct ect. are "" my students"" or came from "" my school"". Freedom of speech. Ciao.",1209859200,2,1356,4.761702127659574
