7562559,2,B0193UZ2BE,"I saw a screening of this before a live performance and I have to say, it was really disappointing.  It was excruciatingly redundant and was almost painful to sit through.  You will not learn anything new about The Residents from watching this.  It's essentially an hour and a half of different people saying that the members of the Residents are anonymous, over, and over, and over again.  And again.  And again.  Thankfully they performed afterwards which made up for this yawnfest.",1461974400,10,484,4.91358024691358
7562560,4,B0193UZ2BE,"Maybe I was expecting more original footage and fewer cult celebrities (Matt Groening, Les Claypool, Jerry Harrison, Dean Ween, and so on) talking about what the Residents mean to them. By now their ""anonymous"" status is really beside the point. Pretending that members of the Cryptic Corporation are not or never were the Residents is like pretending that Clark Kent's glasses totally hide his true Superman identity. I can play along with the gimmick, but I would have liked a more comprehensive examination of the group's artistic progression, with some focus on more than a few of their landmark albums. Projects such as Eskimo, Duckstab, Wormwood, God in Three Persons, Demons Dance Alone, etc, are either barely referenced or passed over completely. It's particularly disappointing that a pivotal collaborator such as Snakefinger hardly rates but a few passing mentions. The film does delve into their formative years in the late sixties-early seventies deeply enough to offer the beginnings of a coherent biographical (or mythological) sketch, but then the narrative randomly jumps back and forth across various decades and lingers for too long on pieces of performances from the recent Wonder of Weird tour.

While the whole of the film is not really equal to the sum of the parts, well, there's still a lot of really cool parts - great snippets of archival footage, trivia such as how the iconic eyeball masks were first conceived and constructed, and some insightful personal reflections of Homer Flynn, Hardy Fox, Jay Clem, and John Kennedy. A further bonus is the extra features which include some classic videos, footage of their first performance, outtakes from Vileness Fats, and much more. If nothing else, Theory of Obscurity showcases elements of the freewheeling creative drive and master craft that have endured across countless permutations of this artistic collective for over forty years.",1457654400,49,1911,5.245098039215686

8743788,2,B0193UZ2BE,"...the subtitle is somewhat misleading: I suppose it is ""A Film About the Residents,"" but to put it more accurately, it is a tribute to the Residents. Most of the run time is spent ticking off the band's various accomplishments, with varying degrees of wit. If you are a fan of the band, there is very little here that will surprise you: The glimpses of their early years are tantalizing, but most of it has been seen before (either on DVDs or on YouTube), and what little genuine conflict and intrigue there is (namely the departures of Jay Clem and John Kennedy) is not explored.

...and that's the weakness of the film: A challenging band is dealt with in a very fawning way, and it seems like a betrayal of the Residents' maverick spirit. Of course, it's a crowd-funded film made with full cooperation of the band, so it's not shocking to find the end product to be basically a feature-length EPK. And having the film based around the World of Weird 40th Anniversary is disappointing, as the tour was a pretty pale shadow of previous outings (and god, Nolan Cook's shredder-dude guitar is just awful), the Residents' once grand, captivating concepts reduced to touring band/groupie cliches. It's depressing to see a band that was once so capable of provocative commentary on any number of cultural touchstones reduced to self-referential in-jokes.

That said, there is some neat stuff... the reminiscences from early associates are super cool, the section on the original design and creation of the eyeball masks is fascinating, and it's great to hear from supporting musicians like Molly Harvey and Laurie Amat (although Nolan Cook is as mannered and obnoxious an interviewee as he is a guitarist). It's strange (and insulting) that Snakefinger is glossed over almost entirely.

And, as other reviewers have pointed out, the whole anonymity shtick is so overplayed. I mean, at this point, it's pretty easy to figure out who the four Residents are (clue: they are all featured within the first 30 minutes of this film) (another clue: one of them came out and SAID he was a Resident after this film was completed). The anonymity gambit was a great device, and very liberating for a long time, until it wasn't.

All in all, a pleasant crash course for newcomers, but fans will find little to sink their teeth in here, and the relentlessly sycophantic tone grates pretty quickly...",1536105600,,2382,4.859605911330049
