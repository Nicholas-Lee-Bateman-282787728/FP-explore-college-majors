8528889,5,B008M2V0X4,"This is an excellent doc! It chronicles Lucas Torres rise to the top of the dope game in Camden, New Jersey but instead of glorifying it shows you the absolute hell he went through, this goes in depth with the political corruption in the city, and betrayal of Lucas by the people he trusted the most! This definitley shows that the ""Life"" is not as glamourous as it looks from the outside.  If you like the realistic portrayals of the street life,  purchase this one today!",1362873600,3,473,4.488372093023256
