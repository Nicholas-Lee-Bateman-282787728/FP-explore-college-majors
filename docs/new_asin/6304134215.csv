826847,4,6304134215,"In the tradition of full moon flavor we have here a  relentless, sarcastic , and fun sized storybook villain who fills the screen with well written dialog and antics. Rumplestiltskin is on a quest to usurp the infant he was promised from the old days of folklore to a now modern world. There are some whimsical scenes of him jerking a biker out of his bike and hitting the road bad to the bone style and getting behind the wheel of a big rig, with maneuvering abilities that would make evil knievel raise a brow to.
This movie is wildly entertaining for horror fans and general film watchers alike. Chock full of campy acting and a very linear storyline making this one to add to the library. The costume design on Rump is nothing shy of tight quality.
This one I recommend...4 out of 5 claw marks.",1466899200,2,798,4.428571428571429

Definitely not worthy of a full 2 stars, however, so it gets a 1 for everything: acting, directing, story, acting again, scariness, production quality, sound...

We almost understand his modern-day presence.  After this, there is nothing to see.  This production should be banned by the Geneva Conventions, although use on Guantanamo Bay detainees would probably produce enough results to end the war on terror.

If you remember the story, there was a simple way to get rid of ol' Rumpy.  Unfortunately, the characters, even after reading the story and learning this try other means.  I wish they hadn't, then I would not have wasted over an hour of my life hoping this would get better.

827506,4,6304134215,"I remember watching this movie when it came out when i was about 5 watching it with my mother. As a kid this movie creeped me out but now that i'm older i watched it again and i see it is more of a half a comedy but still tries to be gory. The kills take place off-screen for the most part but what you do see suggests what the outcome is. It is similar to the film Leprechaun but that shows alot more gore. The story starts with the 1600's early ages and the creature Rumplestiltskin takes a baby and tries to take it's soul. A witch puts a curse on him after saying his name 3 times,and banishes him and the curse can be lifted with a child tears and love. Fast forward to the 1990's and a wife is pregnant with a cop for a husband who gets killed while she hears it over the phone. She has a baby and names it after her husband John who died. The girl,her best friend & the baby John go to an old antique place where she sees the emerald statue of the creature. She thinks of her husband and a tear falls onto the statue then the curse is lifted,he has the power to get out of the spell. She wakes to find her dead husband alive but it is all an illusion then she sees the real creature who wants her baby in exchange. The mother runs and fights for her life and her babies life as she runs all over to get away from him. She meets up with this tv Jerry Springer wannabee and she forces him into helping her run away,but Rump is always right behind her. The lady who sold her the statue is the witch who banished him in the 1600's tries to help her out but Rump chokes her out,kills all the cops and they have a showdown in the graveyard. So the ending i will not give away but i suggest if your a fan of B grade horror flicks with a heavy dose of humor in vein of Leprechaun then get this. Like i said offscreen violence but it is still a good movie. It is rare to find but it is worth the time.",1427414400,4,1899,3.922279792746114

That it was made in 95 is just icing on the cake. Without going into the unnecessary back story the magical little gargoyle hunchback elf hunts babies. In the first scene the little guy is banished into a rock by a witch and thrown into the ocean. Then the witch sets him on fire. Watching this dwarf roll around on the ground on fire is one of the 10 funniest things ever. It has to be seen.

About 500 years after the rock was thrown into the ocean, Rump washes up on shore in LA where he is unleashed by a young widdow who of course has a kid. So the rest of the movie is him chasing her and the kid around. They're also helped out by a loud mouth TV host who happens to be standing on the side of the road when mom and baby are escaping Rump. Yeah this one was high on the made no sense scale if you couldn't tell by its 5 can rating. A cool wrinkle is that this little killing machine can't be killed. He was shot stabbed and set on fire and he didn't die. He's as tough as Myers so yeah he's pretty tough. The best part of the movie was when Rump kills a truck driver and starts chasing after the TV guy and a bundle of blankets he thinks is the kid who are in TV guy's dune buggy in an 18 wheeler. He's three feet tall but you know what? let's have him driving a truck anyway that'll be sweet. If you can't applaud the hell out of that, Sid doesn't know what to tell you. The him driving a truck thing lasted about 40 minutes by the way. And the TV guy was cracking one liners the whole time as he's being chased by a little killer creature. The whole thing was amazing really.

The bulk of this flick was Lincoln Hawk DeJesus all the way. The rest of the time it was Rump doing a Leprechaun impression. An hour and a half of pure b enjoyment. It's going to be a small sub-genre but Sid will without a doubt be on the hunt for more b elf-horror-action/comedies. This one was so great, especially under the right conditions so if you get the opportunity to see this one consider yourself lucky because there are still doubts that this movie actually exsists and wasn't some b induced hilucination.",1289520000,2,2388,4.155507559395248

827870,2,6304134215,"Rumpelstiltskin is a movie I recorded off of a paid channel years ago. I only recently sat down and rewatched it. This movie is from the same people that did Leprechaun, (no surprise there), since this movie is about a little deformed creature man.

The movie is about pregnant woman whose husband dies in the line of duty. Sometime has passed since his death and she's had the baby. Now she visits a pawn shop where she finds this unique looking jade and gold statue. She takes the statue home, and finds herself wishing her husband could see his baby. Well, Rumpelstiltskin ""grants"" her wish, and in return she must now give him her first child. He terrorizes her through the whole movie, and kills the people that gets in his way.

Watching the movie, I noticed there wasn't really any blood in it, and it wasn't all that scary. I found myself getting bored halfway through the movie. I must say that the make up effects on Rumpelstiltskin was pretty realistic looking and creepy. The movie seemed like more of an action movie with a deformed little man as the bad guy, instead of a horror movie.

It wasn't very original either, it reminded me too much of Leprechaun, with a little man terrorizing the characters of the movie untill he gets what he's after, and killing everyone that gets in his way. Same basic plot of Leprechaun, only worse with no blood. It wasn't the worse movie I've seen, but it wasn't all that great, and it didn't creep me out one bit for a horror movie.",1157587200,3,1483,4.5055762081784385

827876,3,6304134215,"""Rumpelstiltskin"" stands proudly as a representative example of a recent trend to scrape the bottom of the barrel in order to come up with something new in the horror genre. O.K., so it isn't that new, as the similarly themed ""Leprechaun"" appeared on the scene some three years before the arrival of this movie, but ""Rumpelstiltskin"" picks up the challenge laid down by Warwick Davis and gang and attempts to push the envelope even further. Instead of asking the diminutive Davis of ""Leprechaun"" fame to pull double duty here, the producers of ""Rumpelstiltskin"" employed some guy named Max Grodenchik to play the scary little man of fairy tale legend. He does an adequate job, too, although that's one of the few good things one can say about this picture. Ultimately, ""Rumpelstiltskin"" fails to win many compliments because it fails on too many levels. In fact, the main thing a viewer will probably come away with after watching this film is a question: What in the heck is Allyce Beasley doing in a film like this? That's right, that loveable waif who played the over talkative and slightly neurotic secretary Agnes DiPesto on the Cybill Shepherd/Bruce Willis sitcom ""Moonlighting"" appears in her full glory throughout the first half of ""Rumpelstiltskin."" Her presence here underscores how far people can fall in Hollywood.
The opening sequence of the film sets the stage for the Rumpelstiltskin legend. Somewhere in fourteenth century Europe, a group of villagers carrying the stereotypical torches chase good old Rump through a forest in search of the missing child of the local miller's daughter. Well, the evil little man has the baby because the child's mother promised to give up her first-born child in exchange for Rump's services. You know the rest of the legend. As the villagers chase Rumpelstiltskin to the edge of a cliff, he demands to have the child as per the arrangement. To accentuate his seriousness, he tears out some guy's eye and eats it, then throws him off a cliff. The village witch, fed up with this sickening behavior, casts a spell on the dwarf that turns him into a strange looking rock. Casting this stone into the ocean, and presumably to a place where it can do no more harm to anyone, the villagers rescue the baby and return to their pitiful lives slaving away for the lord of the manor. Obviously, since all of this happens within the first five minutes of the movie we know that some poor soul will find the rock and unleash the wicked genie within. This opening segue to the real meat of the film had me rolling on the floor with its corny dialogue, cheesy effects, and over the top performances. Too bad the rest of the film isn't nearly as funny.
The movie jumps ahead roughly 500 years, to present day Los Angeles, California. The recently widowed wife of a police officer, Shelley Stewart, conveniently discovers this rock at some weird witch's store. Attracted to the stone by a strange green light, she takes the object home and through a series of highly improbable circumstances promptly unleashes Rumpelstiltskin. What follows is often a plodding series of events wherein the evil dwarf attempts to secure the widow's child in exchange for services rendered (in this case, our heroine wished for her dead husband to return from the grave, which he did for one evening). Throw in the aforementioned Allyce Beasley as Shelley's man starved best friend named Hildy, an obnoxious local talk show host called Max Bergman who eventually takes part in the plot to eradicate Rumpelstiltskin, and you have the fundamentals of this bizarre film. Oddly enough, several scenes in the movie reminded me of the ""Terminator"" franchise, specifically a lengthy (way too lengthy) chase sequence with Rump driving a semi truck and a series of murders in a rural police station. The whole thing wraps up very predictably for this type of film. Too my knowledge, the producers of ""Rumpelstiltskin"" wisely passed on a sequel.
A few good things appear in this film. The actress who plays Shelley Stewart, Kim Johnston Ulrich, does a good job with the lackluster script. The same goes for Allyce Beasley, who easily slums her way through the Hildy role. Tommy Blaze as Max Bergman quickly becomes tiresome with his endless stream of babble and smart alecky lines. Grodenchik as Rumpelstiltskin irritates with his dialogue, too, but at least the make up job inspires some grotesque interest in his character. Personally, my favorite scene in the film involved actor Jay Pickett as Stewart's police officer husband. He isn't around long, but the slow motion shoot out with a street thug that claims his life is hilarious. Overall, the performances in this film aren't as bad as they could be. As an added bonus, Rumpelstiltskin catches on fire on two separate occasions. Lamentably, the negatives often overshadow the positives: uneven pacing results in a chase scene that runs on long after its effectiveness wears off. The lame conclusion to the movie irritates, especially when Rumpelstiltskin calls on the ""powers of darkness"" or some such nonsense to help him destroy Stewart's baby. The powers of darkness? You gotta be kidding me! How generic and tiresome is that line in a horror movie? ""Rumpelstiltskin"" is definitely more of a miss than a hit.
The DVD version of the film, distributed by low budget loving Artisan Entertainment, does not provide much in the way of extras: you do get a trailer for the film and that's about it. As for the picture quality, it's acceptable but nothing you would write home to mother about. ""Rumpelstiltskin,"" probably a film best reserved for die-hard fans of B movie horror, could provide a few laughs to a general audience looking for something slightly ridiculous.",1067212800,20,5732,4.928645294725957
