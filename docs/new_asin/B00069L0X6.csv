And who didn't like the Sinbad movies ... not me ... I LOVED THEM ALL, AND STILL DO!",1169078400,,274,4.5
2179391,5,B00069L0X6,"My family grew up watching these movies. I purchased this series right before the holidays and it was really fun watching the younger kids faces light up as they watched for the first time at our family Christmas party.  I'm sure we will get hours of enjoyment out of this ""fantastic"" collection.",1168819200,4,296,4.6923076923076925
2179392,5,B00069L0X6,"I was very pleased with my purchase.  I am a fan of ""Sinbad"" and was so

happy to get this. It's so nice to be able to watch any time I want.

Any ""Sinbad"" fans would do well to order this product.",1168387200,,197,3.642857142857143
2179393,4,B00069L0X6,I would strongly suggest this series for anyone that has a taste for the classics. All four films are great to watch and the quality of the films is nice.,1140912000,3,154,4.166666666666667
2179394,5,B00069L0X6,These 50's and 60's films I saw at the theatre with my brothers and never forgot them. I plan to give it brother a set to bring back those times!,1140912000,,145,3.8666666666666667
2179395,5,B00069L0X6,I was browsing dvd's and came across this collection. I had always enjoyed watching the Sinbad and Jason films years ago so I decided to buy this collection and watch them again. I must say that I am very happy with this purchase - the films are still exciting to watch and my grandaughter can't watch them often enough. She really enjoys the cyclop scenes. Definitely a good package!,1140652800,,384,4.579710144927536
2179396,4,B00069L0X6,"Overall, these are really fun films:  excellent older effects, good plots, timeless themes.  I particularly liked Jason, but Gulliver is very good as well, cherished memories from my viewing days as a child.  Of the Sinbad films, one Eye of the Tiger is bad (lousy acting, poorly directed, etc.) but the otehr two are great.

Recommended.  This is a good deal and my kids loved watching with me.",1138147200,11,395,4.75
2179397,5,B00069L0X6,"I remember seeing ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" in its original theatrical release. When the evil magician amuses the Caliph, Sinbad, and the court by combining a servant with a cobra was scary enough, but the climactic fight to the death between the dragon (fire-breathing as per expectations) and the Cyclops gave me the willies for a full week! ""Jason and the Argonauts"" had heros, gods, fantastic creatures, and a cameo by Hercules himself, so what's not to like? The other Sinbad films are here too, but none really match ""The 7th Voyage. . ."" Also included is the not as well known but, in my opinion, superb live-action ""The Three Worlds of Gulliver"" (which attempted to preserve some of Swift's satire far better than Max Fliescher's annimated ""Gulliver's Travels"").

But the real star of this collection, as it's title implies, is Ray Harryhausen. And Ray is clearly at his best in the realm of fantasy and mythic folklore. His creatures in this collection are far superior to any of his science-fiction work (with the possible exception of ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers""). Stop-action animation was state-of-the-art special effects when these films were made, and Harryhausen was the best of the best. All these films are in color, and the transfers to disc are exceptionally good! The sound is perfectly satisfactory. All in all, each film is preserved and presented in their original splendor.

This collection is an execellant example of movie making when the emphasis was on story and character rather than all the mayhem the director could cram into one or two hours of film. These films take us to lands off the map, lands marked only ""Here there be Dragons."" The action is plentiful, the heros are heroic, and every single film in this collection has a clear beginning, middle, and a satisfactory ending, quite unlike the movies of today that like to start nowhere, head anywhere aimlessly, and seem only to stop when the FX folks have run out of graphics or explosives (as their imagination had run dry long before the credits rolled).

So make some good hot popcorn with real butter, turn down the lights, and watch some real imaginative movie-making. It's well worth the time, and the price is splendid, and the payoff is enormous fun!",1137628800,30,2252,4.87467362924282
2179398,4,B00069L0X6,"Ray Harryhausen is responsible for two of the best fantasty films ever made:  Jason and the Argonauts and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.  The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is also a good film, though not up to the level of the first Sinbad film.

The 3 Worlds of Gulliver is minor and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger is a step down from the other two Sinbad films (though still with some good moments).

Missing from this collection is another interesting if flawed Harryhausen fantasy: Clash of the Titans.  It would have been nice to have had that as part of the set.",1129161600,43,562,4.365384615384615
2179399,4,B00069L0X6,"When Special Effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen received his lifetime acheivement Oscar, Tom Hanks said that anyone who was a boy of 10 in the 1960's will tell you that ""Jason and The Argonauts"" is one of the greatest movies ever made.

Jason is here, with the living giant bronze statue, the vicious harpies, and of course the many-headed Hydra and its ""children."" Terrific stop-motion fun for all ages. And without the aid of (yawn) computers, you just have to wonder, ""How did he do that?""

Also in this bundle is Gulliver (see if you can spot June Thorburn, the grandmother from Absolutely Fabulous, in an early role), 7th Voyage of Sinbad ('50's-era innocence with the first dueling skeleton on film, not to mention the future Mrs. Bing Crosby), and Golden Voyage of Sinbad (Dance of death with six-armed goddess Kali and Tom Baker of Dr. Who fame).

Eye of the Tiger, on the other hand, is of ""so bad its good""/MST3000 caliber--with the Duke's son, Patrick Wayne as So-bad--I mean, Sinbad--and chanteuse Margaret Whiting in her first (and last) dramatic role as the evil sorceress.  And yes, that's Dr. Quinn/Jane Seymour wondering how she'll ever live this one down as a buxom princess with a baboon for a brother.  I'm not kidding.

An extra treat with this set are the scores for Jason, 7th Voyage, and Gulliver by legendary screen composer Bernard Herrmann (Citizen Kane, Psycho). Juicy stuff.

Anybody who likes good old-fashioned matinee fantasy will want to own these treats.",1107302400,102,1485,4.892430278884462

If you are a younger generation, you might not like this movie. The visual effects would look ridiculous to you. You have to be from that age (in my opinion) to appreciate those movies. The story is nice and typical to Rays movies.",1399939200,,376,4.385714285714286
2179409,5,B00069L0X6,If you love Ray Harryhausen like I do this is a must have. I bought my collection used but I is in excellent condition and I am very pleased with the seller.

These three movies in particular that I went to see in the theatre and my community center. I can watch them over and over again.

Thank you amazon. Good job..",1364083200,,144,4.5
2179413,5,B00069L0X6,"my wife insisted I buy a replacement copy. So I did. From Amazon. We've been re-watching ever since. Its fascinating what Harryhausen pulled off in the days before CGI. But even CGI still requires some stop-action Harryhausen tricks to pre-test those ideas that don't render very well in the computer. Wire frames still don't always present a story idea in a way that 3D pose-able objects can. We love our Harryhaussen. See also, The Mysterious Island, not included in this set but available on Amazon.",1362182400,,502,4.91764705882353

2179416,5,B00069L0X6,I have the old standard TV and had no problems with any parts not being viewable on the screen.  It looked and played well on my dvd.  These movies were enjoyed when I was a child and I still enjoy them.,1359504000,,203,3.926829268292683

2179418,5,B00069L0X6,"Ray Harryhausen truly is a master, and a genius, whose imagination, to me, can't be equaled. These movies will capture your imagination, and stay with you, 'til the end of time...",1349049600,,179,4.806451612903226

2179420,5,B00069L0X6,"You can't beat the high adventure and awesome harryhausen effects present in these movies. 7th Voyage is classic cinema, with all the elements of a grand adventure, and it only goes uphill from there. Eye of the tiger is very, very 70's, but still great, and Golden Voyage may be one of the best fantasy films ever produced. Definitely check these out if you have any appreciation for effects genius Harryhausen, or if you're a fan of fantasy in general. Also appropriate for younger viewers, which is a plus.",1319760000,,509,4.730337078651686
2179421,5,B00069L0X6,"These films were great artistic and technical achievements. The animation in these films required a great investment in time and labor, taking a year or more to produce for each movie. Work like Ray Harryhausen's is the reason we have CGI. Stop motion would cost too much to produce and take much too long for studios today. Films like these laid the foundation for films like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Lord of the Rings.

These are also great, fun, adventure films. I never get tired of them.",1319760000,2,497,4.6477272727272725
2179422,5,B00069L0X6,"For me, these movies are a joy to watch.  They're not for everybody to be sure but to one who was a child prior to all the newest special effects, these flicks were the epitome of entertainment for SciFi buffs.  So I not only get to enjoy a good movie, but I also get to relive good memories.",1310515200,,292,4.017241379310345
2179423,5,B00069L0X6,"These are the films that modern science fiction has based itself on. Ray Harryhausen is a genius. The movies are as entertaining as anything available today. The acting was of the quality hard to find today. Patrick Wayne, Jane Seymour, Taryn Powers, Honor Blackman and many more. These films were revolutionary at the time of their making and their worth remains invaluable. Jason and the Argonauts, as well as Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, will forever be two of the finest adventure films ever created.",1304467200,,508,4.850574712643678

2179426,5,B00069L0X6,These are great movies and I love the claymation in them. GREAT! My son came unglued (he is 4) when the claymation skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts came out fighting. He loved the Cyclops. FUN! I loved these films when I was a child and I am enjoying watching them with my son. FUN FUN FUN!!,1298851200,,295,4.192982456140351
2179427,5,B00069L0X6,"Ray Harryhausen, what can you say, ground breaking, genius. These films are a foundation from my childhood's imagination and wonder. Well presented and the extras on the DVDs are fantastic. A great box set I will watch over and over again.",1295222400,,239,4.853658536585366
2179428,5,B00069L0X6,If you like the classics you will love the Harryhausen collections.  These brought back the childhood memories of watching these on the old Black and White TV we had in our humble home.  Simple pleasures for a rainy day and nicely packaged.  .,1294617600,,243,4.604651162790698
2179429,3,B00069L0X6,"I remember these movies as a young boy. I would pretend to travel with Sinbad to exotic lands, bravely fighting monsters and getting Gold and other treasures.  <Grinn> I'd let Sinbad have the girls but the other pirates and I would fight the British, Spain and other countries for the glory of Sinbad. Even though the claymation is a bit hokey by today standards, it was nice to journey to the past once again.",1294531200,,410,4.54054054054054
2179430,5,B00069L0X6,"Well, if you haven't seen these and you are looking for something modern and you like to be critical of movies then go elsewhere, these are great old movies for pure fun with the stop action animation. Ray HarryHausen was great.  It was great to be able to add them to my collection all at once.  My 12 year old grandson who is into Spiderman and Iron Man and X-Men and all the modern stuff absolutely loves them.",1283212800,,413,4.282051282051282

2179432,5,B00069L0X6,"Im Incredibly happy with this Pack, Im a Ray Harryhausen Fan I love all the movies he made, so i wanted to get every movie with his work. This Pack help my so much with my collection, Because of 2 things:

1-It has Jason And The Argonauts that is practically his best film.

2-If you buy this pack you will have the Sinbad trilogy.

So, Some people that just want to see the best films of Ray in just one pack were a little disappointed because this pack Have ""The 3 Worlds Of Gulliver""  and it doesn't  have ""Clash Of The Titans"" and that's something bad for some people that don't want the entire collection, but for me it was good not having to buy ""The 3 Worlds Of Gulliver"" separately.

Now I'm going to say the extras and the quality of sound and video:

-Jason and the Argonauts: The quality of this DVD is very, very Good Both in Sound And Video. The extras are the Theatrical Trailer and an Interview of Ray talking about this movie.

-The 7th Voyage: The quality of the video in this one its a little grainy but it still good. The sound it's not so good in this one and it's almost impossible to hear it in Spanish but in English it still good. I really like that all the Sinbad trilogy has a lot of trailers of Ray's movies.

-The Golden Voyage: The quality is very Good Both in Sound And Video, and it has all the trailers I Said before (Something i like about this DVD it's that it has side A and B for Fullscreen and Widescreen).

-Sinbad and The Eye of the Tiger: its exactly like ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"", except for the widescreen and fullscreen option.

-The 3  Worlds of Gulliver: The quality is very Good Both in Sound And Video. The Extras are the Theatrical Trailer, ""This Is Dynamation"", ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"" and ""The Making Of"".

2179433,5,B00069L0X6,"This collection of Ray Harryhausen movies includes ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"", ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"" and ""The 3 Worlds of Gulliver.""

The best of this collection is ""Jason and the Argonauts"". I first saw this movie in the early 90s and it got me interested in Greek mythology and I read two childrens books on Greek mythology. I then went on to read other books such as Edith Hamilton's ""Mythology"", ""The Odyssey"", ""The Illiad"", ""Antigone"", ""Medea"", ""Oedipus Rex"" and others. I also took two years of Latin for my language requirement in high school.

Jason and the Argonauts is an interesting movie to me. The fact that Jason worshipped and spoke to an idol of Hera boggled me when I first saw the film. I was raised a Christian and I was thinking, ""Isn't it against the Christian faith to worship a pagan idol."" The movie does have one scene though that fits in well with Christian morality in that it encourages belief in a higher form. When Jason first appears as an adult, he doesn't believe in the gods. He discovers that the man before him is Hermes and he is taken to Mount Olympus to meet Zeus and the others. Thus he gets to see for himself that the gods do indeed exist.

The movie is one grand adventure. He encounters a giant bronze man, a hydra, and walking skeletons and the stop motion animation effects are mainly what Ray Harryhausen's movies are famous for.

The second best movie in the collection is ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"". Like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" it also has a skeleton fight in it.

""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"" on the other hand was so bad that I couldn't make it through it. ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""The 3 Worlds of Gulliver"" are okay but not great.",1266019200,,1778,4.492260061919505

It's not an issue of cinematography, or even the crude sets.  The first few moments of trademark animation are interesting, but barely so.  The scripts, staging, and most of the acting are remarkably poor for a major release.

For all of the magic in the plotlines, the only real miracle is performed by Tom Baker as he somehow manages to keep at least one movie corpse from rotting away altogether.

Here's a suggestion to Amazon:  Please consider a requiring reviewers to declare if they have, or had, any financial interest in the product reviewed.

Buyer beware:  take the time to borrow or rent at least one before you consider buying the set.",1249344000,4,791,4.7226277372262775

I watched them for the Cyclops, for the human skeletons coming up out of the earth, grown from planted teeth, for the dragons and monsters thrashing about.  To see gigantic creatures pick up human beings and examine them for their possible tastiness--that was an amazing thing to be watching on celluloid!  It did not bother me that the motion was a bit jerky--I deduced at the time that these scary studio creations had been posed and shot a frame at a time, and my feeble little mind had thought this was terribly sophisticated, as FX go. I still get a kick out of seeing them and re-makes of the same stories just do not do it for me.",1221696000,,754,4.378571428571429
2179447,5,B00069L0X6,"With most boxed sets, the DVDs are linked by an actor (like Errol Flynn), director (like Sergio Leone) or genre (such as noir).  It is rare to see sets with something else in common, but this is the case with The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen.  While I suppose it could be argued that these are related because they are fantasy movies, in truth, it is Harryhausen who unites them:  there aren't many boxed sets which feature a special visual effects designer, but if there was to be one, it would naturally feature Harryhausen.

Sure, by today's standards, the effects in the movies in this set are rather crude, but in their era, they were pretty good.  This is especially the case when you consider the effects in other giant monster movies of the time which usually featured a man in a costume crushing miniatures or a regular animal made large through obvious camera tricks.  Of course, these effects were simpler to do than Harryhausen's stop-motion work, but the short cuts showed.

First in the set (chronologically) is The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, in which the hero must restore a beautiful princess to her proper size after she is shrunk to just a few inches.  From the start, there's little skimping when it comes to the monsters; this one includes a cyclops, a dragon, a roc and a sword-wielding skeleton.  This film (and the other two Sinbad movies in the set) are a reminder of a time when the stereotypical version of Arabian lands was one of romance and magic.  It's obviously legend, but at the same time, a more charming depiction of this region than we see in more recent movies.

The second - and really the only disappointing one in the bunch - movie in the set is 3 Worlds of Gulliver - which adapts the Swift tale to have the title character stranded in lands where the people are either tiny (Lilliput) or giant (Brobdingnag) (the third world is England).  There's little in the way of monsters in this one, other than a crocodile and a Brobdingagian squirrel.

Jason and the Argonauts is a loose depiction of the myth, with Jason assembling a group of heroes to steal the golden fleece and re-take the kingdom that was once his.  Like a later Harryhausen movie, Clash of the Titans (not included), this one also depicts the gods (including Bond girl Honor Blackman as Hera).  Besides the James Bond connection, there is also a Dr. Who one, with second Doctor Patrick Troughton in a small role.  Oh, and there monsters aplenty, including a hydra, a giant animated statue and more malevolent skeletons.  While this may be Harryhausen at his peak, it also is a problematic story, both because Jason's so-called heroism threatens to ruin another kingdom who has done him no evil, and because the story is left rather open-ended (was a sequel intended?).

A decade would pass before the next movie in this set, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, in which Sinbad battles an evil prince played by a future Dr. Who, Tom Baker.  There's a little less in the way of monsters here, but there is a centaur and a ship's figurehead come to life.  Baker is fun to watch as the prince who dabbles in the dark arts at great cost, as he attempts to obtain great power.

Finally, there is Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, which you might think featured an eye of the tiger (or some mystical gem with that name) but doesn't (although there is a saber-toothed tiger).  Monsters include a troglodyte, a giant walrus and a bronze minotaur (called the minotaun).  Similar to 7th Voyage, Sinbad is seeking to restore someone, in this case a prince transformed into a baboon.  And again, there is both a James Bond and Dr. Who connection:  Patrick Troughton returns in a bigger role, and Bond girl Jane Seymour plays the love interest.

The acting and writing in these movies are nothing special, but that doesn't make them any the less fun, plus if you're worried about what to show your kids, these are pretty harmless.  With a few extras, this is an enjoyable set that lets you see the special effects of the 1960s and `70s at their pre-Star Wars best.",1211673600,8,4049,4.610878661087866

Save for Tim Burton and the Wallace and Gromit folks, no one is doing it anymore and I think it's so much fun to watch. All of the movies in this Harryhausen set are worth watching. The best one is Jason and the Argonauts. It's also fun seeing that at the end of all the Sinbad movies, two creatures always duke it out while Sinbad and his crew are trying to get away.

8040705,3,B00069L0X6,"On the one hand, it's gratifying and exciting to see five works of such brilliant design and imagination packaged back to back in one box set. On the other, this is a somewhat misleading product. In 2004, Columbia basically took five of its individual Harryhausen DVDs with their original packaging, barcodes and no additional supplements or booklets, and threw them together into a simple cardboard case advertised as a ""collection."" If you just want the movies (all but one of which are widescreen), you probably be perfectly happy with this, but if you are looking for the Criterion, Anchor Bay or Artificial Eye treatment of these films with remastering and lots of delicious supplements, booklets and commentaries, you're going to be sorely disappointed and will probably feel cheated. The biggest downshot is the price, which retails for around $60; some used copies are sold online for up to $150! Frankly, if you're really interested in this I would suggest either buying the dvds individually or hunting around for an inexpensive used box set.",1468540800,2,1052,5.086705202312139
