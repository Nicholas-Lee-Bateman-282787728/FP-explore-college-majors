8310337,3,B001I1X1AQ,"Documentary was extremely superficial.  Mr Bodeker would have been better served with a broader range of interviewees.  He could have compared responses between urban and rural blacks or between age groups, or between democrats and republicans. As it was all the people he interviewed said the same thing, which was that they suffered from racism and on a daily basis.",1365033600,,368,5.116666666666666
8310338,1,B001I1X1AQ,"I would not call this documentary controversial. I would, however, call it ridiculous. As a White man in a constantly changing country, I can only imagine his discomfort with the implications of his past and how it informs the present. It's still not an excuse to waste your time making a movie about something you have not educated yourself on. Asking uneducated homeless people to define something that scholars argue about daily (because this ""stuff"" is alive and morphing as time passes) is unfair and pregnant with bias (and a need to shake off any personal responsibility for ensuring our society becomes a full on melting pot...instead of the heterogeneous salad of cultures sharing a bowl).

Furthermore, making people look silly then claiming it wasn't his intention when he is a director is preposterous. One, he insults the intelligence of his viewers. Two, if he has no control over the tone of his content, then what/why exactly is he DIRECTing?

I have a VERY open mind when it comes to sociology and social psychology, but the entire movie felt very give-me-a-breaky. It seemed like the director was desperate to discredit the notion of racism in this country, but didn't know enough about it do anything more than make Black people (and some White people) look silly. I wonder if I would have been interviewed for this joke show if my thoughts an explanations would have made the final cut. Considering his directional choices, I doubt it.

This movie is worse than a waste of resources. It's detrimental to the thinking of uneducated people looking for an excuse to cast aside the implications of how our national dynamic as built.

It's one of those movies that you have to take with a grain of salt.",1330732800,7,1718,4.833333333333333
8310339,2,B001I1X1AQ,"This documentary disappointed me.  It was a great idea poorly executed and I can only believe that either the filmmaker is inexperienced or more inclined to spin the topic of race and not really delve into what it really is.  He goes about taking a small pool of people and then pointing out to the biases and inaccuracies regarding the term racism and what it really means, which is a very interesting topic that really needs to be discussed, to simply deconstructing the term without telling you what racism really is.  Its meant to leave you believing that racism doesn't really exist and that its some social construct designed to hoodwink everyone that it exists in the world.  If he were serious he would research how the notion of race was constructed to begin with and then analyze the idea of what racism IS and then what it ISN'T. People are confused about what racism really is, this is true and there were some points he highlighted that really nailed this point to the wall but its as if he had one simple goal and that was to prove that white people are unfairly perceived as racist and because of this are now not allowed the privileges of minorities like having their own advocacy groups.  He's very intent to hone into this last point.  I did some research to see what other films Craig Boedeker had produced and some background information in general and couldn't find anything outside of the site for his film and a mention of him on St**m Fr**nt, the white racist organization inviting their members to go see a screening at a church called The Abundant Life fellowship, the same link showed a promotion for David Duke for President in 2010.  Go figure.

It was an interesting topic but a missed opportunity driven by an obvious bias, some of his points are incredibly valid and point to how political correctness can interfere with critical thinking, on the other hand his failure to broaden the topic to encompass what racism is as well as what it isn't and how PC tools inhibit discussion on race and how Caucasians are wrongly perceived as racist by nature (a notion he also fails to explore), or how other races depict racism to whom and why, he fails to really explore the topic or find any deeper layers on the subject.",1299542400,5,2246,4.5975
8310340,5,B001I1X1AQ,"I watched this film with my kids and they loved it. This is great for teaching kids about critical-thinking skills and how media (and school) propaganda is so one-sided. The kids kept mentioning points that were made and asked all sorts of great questions -- a great conversation-starter. Anyone from any race can watch this and benefit from it. It does not have the depth of say Nobel-prizewinner William Shockley's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shockley-on-Eugenics-and-Race-The-Application-of-Science-to-the-Solution-of-Human-Problems/dp/1878465031/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shockley on Eugenics and Race: The Application of Science to the Solution of Human Problems</a>&nbsp;articles and writings on race, but it is great to watch for anyone. I loved it. A real ""conversation about race"" has two sides and you will only find them both in film here. My favorite part is when they ask why blacks are over-represented in basketball, and then asked why whites are even more vastly over-represented in the field of physics. Two completely different answers and two completely different and illogical standards. The faces people made when they realized what they were automatically saying from their politically-correct training was classic! The visual media can teach so much more -- a picture is worth a thousand words, a moving picture so much more. A must-see film, and a great educational tool.",1257984000,22,1443,5.975845410628019
8310341,5,B001I1X1AQ,"In America, race is a topic that touches and affects all other topics, yet there is comparatively little produced in books or videos to address this central American topic. This producer has tried to do that, and I think, very well. The first reviewer has given a summary of the content, so I won't repeat that here. My only regret is that it is only an hour long. It should be expanded to a multi-part series. I notice, and wonder why amazon.com isn't stocking this item. You can buy it, as I did, from the producer. You should. I highly recommend it.",1231027200,8,552,4.421568627450981
8310342,5,B001I1X1AQ,"The video ""A Conversation about Race"" was made to ask people some disturbing questions about race.  It follows on the heels of another video, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-the-Darkness-Falls-The-Racially-Divided-States-of-America/dp/B000UU0UKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When the Darkness Falls: The Racially Divided States of America</a>,"" which deals with America's Founding Father's honest opinions on race, and where this nation may be headed if current trends remain unchecked.  Unlike that movie, however, the producer of ""A Conversation about Race,"" Craig Bodeker, set about to interview people from various races, which he told them was being done to end racism now.  During the course of numerous short interviews, Mr. Bodeker sought examples of ""racism,"" and how people defined the very word.  More importantly, Mr. Bodeker dared to ask some rather difficult questions, which made many of his guests a little tongue-tied.

Bodeker starts out by asking if it's fair to say that blacks excel at basketball.  Most the people interviewed agreed with this statement.  He then asked the interviewees if it was also fair to say that whites might excel at something--such as tests.  It seemed as if many of their jaws dropped--the very same people who had no disagreement with the concept that blacks may excel at something.

Bodeker also brings up the age-old argument of tests being ""culturally biased,"" an argument that was greeted with little resentment.  Actually, there was some resentment when Bodeker pointed out that Asians often score higher than whites, and asked the interviewees if whites were making tests that made them intentionally look bad.

When bringing up leaders of blacks, he mentioned Jesse Jackson.  A white woman remarked that Jackson was an ""advocate for black people.""  Bodeker asked who was an advocate for white people, a question that begged an answer.  No one seemed able to produce a name.

Other obvious perceptions were challenged: Bodeker pointed out the high rate of black on white rapes, according to the Department of Justice's crime statistics, with there being approximately 37,000 cases in 2005 (or, an average of approximately 100 per day); on the other hand, there were under 10 cases of whites raping blacks for all of 2005.  He then asks why is it acceptable for blacks to bring up alleged crimes of whites from last century (slavery being the typical case, though few whites actually owned slaves, and many whites emigrated to the U.S. after the Civil War), though it is unacceptable for whites to ask about the crimes of blacks in recent times?

What is particularly interesting is the immigration-question, which was posed to both blacks and whites.  The white interviewees seemed like they did not mind the illegal immigration invasion, whereas it bothered many blacks.  Such a difference in opinion may be because many blacks have to actively compete against illegal aliens for legitimate jobs, or they may be better-exposed to cultural differences, not to mention Mexican-gangs, in their immediate neighborhoods.

Bodeker also tells of an experience that he once had, where his teacher played a game to essentially indoctrinate his classmates and him to the liberal mindset by using a guilt-complex.  It was certainly an interesting case that Bodeker experienced.  Yet, even today, such antics are all too common in schools, essentially teaching children propaganda rather than the ability to think.  In fact, it seems all too common that children today at schools are not taught to think for themselves, but rather to follow a narrow propagandistic viewpoint, and any deviation from such may result in the suspension or expulsion from school for daring to be politically incorrect.

And what is the final conclusion of the video?  A dread-locked black, who is missing a few teeth, surmises: ""Scientists have proved that we're all the same.""  Yet, after watching this video, perhaps one might gather up enough courage to ask the question of the century: ""What proof really exists that we're all the same, and could it not be true that there are some inherent differences among the races beyond skin color and politically correct perceptions?""  The truth to the question is out there, but it must somehow be found among the tidal wave of propaganda saturating our ""educational"" facilities.",1223683200,16,4388,5.349344978165939
