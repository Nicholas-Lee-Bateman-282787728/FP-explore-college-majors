8539943,5,B009D4GRD8,My father got me a cd of this story when I was a child and it is wonderful to be able to share it especially with all of its cultural aspects with my own children. The dvd version has still pictures as though it is a book being read to you. Perhaps not as exciting  as a moving picture but just as entertaining and my kids are loving it :),1477180800,,339,3.842857142857143

8539945,5,B009D4GRD8,Not enough is shared of Irish mythology. This is a very well done telling of the Finn McCoul legend in a hilarious mode. Kudos to Catherine O'Hara and the other artists and writers involved.,1444003200,,190,4.617647058823529
8539946,5,B009D4GRD8,"This is a rare and hard to find story...and it is told with an authentic Irish accent, an excellent tale.  The best version we have found and in our opinion, the true story of Finn himself.  Great music too!",1369785600,2,207,4.282051282051282
8539947,5,B009D4GRD8,My two little ones loved this story and asked for more like it. It is nice to see something classic and simple that is enjoyable for all ages of children. Please bring more like it!,1366502400,2,181,4.2
