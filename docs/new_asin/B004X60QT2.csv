4492283,5,B004X60QT2,"The other reviewers did a good job summing up the features. So I  am just going to comment on the claim of this being a special limited release.

With the banner ""Limited Edition: No More Than 100,000 Copies Will Be Pressed"" on the bottom of the artwork, Code Red should have numbered the copies. Then they would have truly been ""Limited Edition"".

It would have been nice to see what number out of 100,000 I have.",1311897600,2,414,4.421052631578948
4492284,5,B004X60QT2,"Long derided by elitist and stately horror critics, but much loved by the Exploitation/Slasher/Gore crowd, the notorious Video Nasty ""NIGHTMARE"" has finally been bestowed upon us by the fine folks at Code Red! Grim, dark, and featuring the most shocking decapitation scene you will ever see, ""NIGHTMARE"" is perfect for fans of films such as ""MANIAC"", ""DON'T GO IN THE HOUSE"", and ""PIECES"". Lead actor Baird Stafford gives a sulking and menacing portrayal of a man overcome with mental illness, and there is a pervasively downbeat vibe to this film that is hard to shake.

This release is packaged beautifully! The original theatrical artwork with a strikingly lurid color scheme sets the tone before you even begin viewing. For extras we have a commentary track with Baird Stafford, and FX man Cleve Hall. This commentary track is very informative. Stafford has a razor sharp recollection of many facets of the shoot. I found this a very enjoyable listen. Then we have the ""MAKING OF A NIGHTMARE"" interview segment with Stafford, Hall, and Tom Ward. And, as an extra bonus, the ""NEW YORK NIGHTMARE"" interview segment with veteran makeup man Ed French! I was ecstatic to see him included as he also worked on another favorite of mine- ""BLOOD RAGE"". Sadly, this interview is rather short, and French seems far more interested in pointing out his extensive resume of Emmy nominations, blah, blah. Still a nice little extra, regardless. There is also a 95 minute interview with director Romano Scavolini, but it is in Italian with no subtitles. I am hoping that if this DVD release sells well enough, perhaps one day we might get a BluRay release with the interview subtitled.

Oh, and so there is no confusion, all copies are 2 DISC sets with three separate transfers. I personally prefer the 2008 HD master on disc one, but I also recommend checking out the brand new 2011 telecine on disc 2 if you are watching the film without the commentary track. The matte line on the disc 2 transfer is lowered, thus giving some more detail at the bottom of the screen. This was a nice touch, especially in the porn palace scene, but overall after comparison, I just really prefer the colors and saturation of the 2008 master.

I am thrilled to finally have this gem on DVD. The wait is finally over!",1311638400,21,2287,4.784810126582278
4492285,4,B004X60QT2,"Code Red has done a spectacular job with this sleazy horror film. First off it is a two disc set. This release contains THREE versions of the film
Disc one has a HiDef Master 1:78 16 x 9 cut (this was a good print)  and a full frame color corrected cut of the movie (this isn't too good)
while disc 2 has a brand new 2011 telecine 1:78:1 16 x 9 transfer which is the best of the bunch. Disc 2 is labeled DVDr - but rest assured it is not..it's a little Code Red joke..
Bonus features include Audio Commentary with make up artist Cleve Hall and Baird Stafford, an uncensored 95min Italian interview from Romano Scavolini in Italian Language ( no subtitles ) , ""Making of a Nightmare"" interview with Baird Stafford, Cleve Hall and Tom Ward, ""New York Nightmare"" interview with Edward French ( special effects artist) 2 different Nightmare trailers, Code Red trailers...
The movie itself is about an adult who keeps having Nightmares about his childhood,his past, leading to his murderous self in the present. It's gory, perverse, sleazy , just the way gore lovers like it..
I will not say too much about scenes and spoil any characters it other than there is a gratuitous amount of splatter gore, nudity, an unforgettable scene with a lady and her *toy*. To answer some questions, their is a head chopping blood spurting scene, a stabbing scene, a woman tied up being eaten by rats, gunfire gore, foaming at the mouth. A ladies' head surrounded by bloody insides, liver, stomach...
At times the film's plot is a little incoherent, hard to follow but if you stick with it like I did,as a first time viewer, you will be rewarded with a sleazy horror gem that is highly compelling.
None of the actors will win academy awards but it was at least credible for a film such as this..
This film isn't for everyone , but if you like movies like Maniac, Rituals, gore, fans of independent genre films this is highly recommended
Good show Code Red !",1311379200,41,1936,4.531428571428571
4492286,2,B004X60QT2,"I guess there's important information to be gained from seeing all of those sex workers being phony as all get out like sex workers often are, albeit in late '70's/early 80's fashion, since the main character was present and his facial expressions and memories were also displayed, but the idea that someone would pay to see someone very obviously pretending to enjoy sex and then seeing that idea acted out as a reality, albeit a fictionalized one, is just infuriating.  Also, the aesthetic of late 70's/early 80's legalized prostitution (strip clubs, porn etc.) is very off putting, to me anyway.  The rest of the film, the first 10 minutes roughly, were interesting and creepy at times, somewhat stylish, grim... the opening scene was almost had me shoot out of my chair, and I didn't see past the first 15 minutes due to the cavemanic pre-internet attitudes about sex/porn on wide and prolonged display.....and then with the increasing sense that a murder was (possibly) going to take place...but...NOT Yet!, wait....just wait...keep waiting....seriously, bad acting and suspense?

I am content with all the prints and at least we get three. Especially after having to view all the crap throughout the years. The bad grain usually occurs through change of scenes. Its not that bad in my opinion. The only BAD thing is the smack in the face interview with Romano Scavolini with NO SUBS.And they put an exclamation point after it as to say ha,ha!

Tom Savini worked on it, but he didnt.

This had a lotta hype when it was rare, so I was excited to get it on DVD.

I was disappointed by the film overall because it could have been better in many aspects.

I understand they had a ""dollar menu"" budget, IF that, but still....

If you saw it many years ago and it has some nostalgic value to you, and you're happy it ""was"" released on DVD

then I understand.  However, if you just stumbled upon this film and had never seen it before

you will probably agree with me.

It is definately not worth the 50 bucks it goes for as of right now ill tell you that.

There are other ways to see this and I suggest you do so before spendin your hard worked 50 on it.

As a rare horror DVD collector (like me) then it is worth it.

Looking at other reviews here, I can understand some of the frustration with the film transfers...but come on people...there are THREE transfers here! How many deluxe DVDs even give you two? And aside from the untranslated or subtitled interview, the extras are fine, especially the interview with FX man Cleve Hall.

If you've never seen this, it's worth the extra loot (now that it's out of print) as few slasher films ever reached this level of mayhem, especially the finale that still manages to shock and raise goosebumps.

4492303,3,B004X60QT2,I remember when this movie first came out and then got banned and was removed from practically every movie theatre back in the early 1980's. Watching it again today showed me how things have changed. What was horrific back then is nothing compared to what is out there today. Nightmare still has some good scenes but modern technology (special effects) has left this movie in the dust.

He decides to head to Florida as he wants to slaughter a family that he is familar with.

One of the most screwed up films of all time and most notorious horror movies of the 80's. This 1981 psychological horror thriller shocked audiences that year while still making a fortune in the grindhouse theaters and drive-ins as it was played uncut and without a rating, the film is kind of a slasher movie but more of a character study on a troubled man on the childhood he has been through. There are some horrific scenes of violence mainly with that unforgettable climax which remains memorable, the acting is typical low budget and there's lots of sleaze abound. Over the years the film has became a cult fave with a following of fans including Quentin Tarantino to Eli Roth, this movie has been requested on DVD for years has finally arrived.

This 2-Disc edition contains all three versions such as 2008 high def master 1.78.:81 (16x9) version, 2005 full frame color corrected telecine and new 2011 telecine version from a better 35mm print as it is the best of the versions. The film is uncut and uncensored with extras including behind the scenes footage, interviews, audio commentary and trailers.

4492307,3,B004X60QT2,"Most people aren't even aware that this movie exists. However, I'm not most people, and sleazy exploitation splatter films are kind of my thing. When I found out that the wait was over, that there was indeed a DVD release date set for ""Nightmare"", I felt like a kid on Christmas eve. I had first seen this movie twenty-five years ago, and I remembered it well. This was not your run of the mill splatterfest. Most offerings from this genre are a dime a dozen, but THIS... This one had a way of crawling underneath your skin to fester. Very creepy stuff.

When it arrived in the mail, I looked over the packaging. Yep. Original theatrical poster art just as I remembered it. A small warning bell went off when I read the promotional blurb on the back. It seemed to focus on talking about how many copies this DVD was likely to sell. Whatever. I watched the first five minutes of all transfers, and realized just how spoiled I've become in regards to picture clarity.

These transfers are a mess. The amount of debris, scratches, pops and everything else make darkened scenes resemble a colorful snowstorm. Given that the project was in the works for roughly ten years, this surprised me. I would think that in that amount of time, a team could have digitally cleaned the film up on a frame by frame basis. Or maybe not. I'm not an expert in film restoration. Maybe they did the best with what they had. Still, I kept thinking ""Wow. Ten years and this is the best they could come up with?""

But you know what? Ultimately, it doesn't matter. The degraded quality of the film actually contributes to its overall effect. The makers of ""Grindhouse"" understood this perfectly, took a crystal clear print, and added a lot of scratches and sloppy splices into the mix. What matters is that ""Nightmare"" is finally here in all its uncensored glory, leaving a trail of slime wherever it goes. Prepare to be disturbed.",1318896000,12,1905,4.580645161290323

A VHS title, ""Terror on Tape"" ruined much of the, ""Scares"" for me early on. So, avoid that.

Anyway, when I first viewed this, years ago, I expected a lot of action, something that at least kept pace with ""Maniac"". Well, I was disappointed. This movie has a bit of a slow pace, and you'll realize that when you watch it, since it reminds you which day it is as the movie strolls along.

With this more recent viewing, I was older, and, I kept very low expectations. I remembered I thought the movie was below, ""so-so"" when I saw it years ago. That helped, as I really enjoyed it the second time. It has a bit more to it than a normal slasher film.

Give it a go, just don't expect the type of energy, ""Maniac"" and such have, and you may have a decent time. I kept that in mind years later, and I had a much better time with the film than I did 10+ years ago. It also helped, that the picture was much better, even with the hisses and scratches on the print (I viewed the, ""Open Matte"" version on this release).

4492310,5,B004X60QT2,"I find the footage of 42nd street in all its dangerous and lurid detail really appeals to my sense of long gone seedy N.Y.C aestheticism, a neon labyrinth of temptation and vice. Lead actor Baird Stafford recants his photographic memory for this production on his commentary track ""that shooting these scenes after dark was asking for a mugging"" Thankfully the camera sticking out of the car following him allowed his safe passage.

Stafford is the star here, in a performance so committed that it transcends the regular suspension of disbelief required for general film viewing and not least in horror cinema. Unlike in the similarly comparable film: Maniac where titular actor Joe Spinell breaks his believability of playing a disturbed psychopath to enact dialogue scenes with Caroline Munro, so the film could gain financial completion, in Nightmare Baird Stafford remains true to his character. When we see George Tatum foaming at the mouth and the effluvia running into his nose and eyes as he writhes and contorts his body in seizure is one of many seemingly convincing portraits of physical and emotional psychosis.

What sets this apart from so many slasher / gore movies of this period is the fusion of graphic sexual suggestion and gore, I can't think of another picture I've seen quite like this one. The special effects makeup may not be the most convincing ever put on screen, although they look suitably horrible enough for this viewer, but the inclusion of child actors involved is genuinely disturbing and some may argue morally dubious, but hey it's only a movie. The child playing the disturbed George as a boy is another credible performance and if you listen to the commentary track you will hear how the boy's mother on seeing her son emerge from the shooting of the recurrent ""Nightmare"" was that of being horrified.

Here in Blighty this film is widely known by fans as being one of the most notorious video nasties on the banned list, not least in part due to the fact that the UK distributor was jailed here for six months, not surprisingly then that the movie is unlikely to ever get released here in this the full and uncut edition.

As an older viewer returning to this film after many years I can see now that Nightmare does steal from Italy's grandfather of horror cinema Mario Bava. Anyone familiar with the reveal shot in: Shock 1977 used twice in Nightmare and the bouncing white ball signifying madness in: Kill Baby, Kill 1966, but if you're going to steal then stealing from a master is the way to go.

Special mention must go to this film's score which perfectly complements the theme of mental psychosis. This synthesizer based composition sounds something like trapped birds crying, very creepy and one of the more original early 1980's horror scores.",1316217600,12,2791,4.867368421052632
4492311,2,B004X60QT2,"Mental patient suffering from horrific nightmares due to a grisly childhood memory skips out on treatment and embarks on a killing spree from New York to Florida.

After years of waiting for Code Red to deliver, fans finally have ""Nightmare"" available on DVD. This disc is a nightmare all right--for all the wrong reasons.

It has been stated that the original print has been lost/destroyed but since this 2-disc release contains THREE different versions of the film, you'd think at least they could manage to restore one to acceptable standard. Not so! The best of the three is on the second disc (16x9) but even it suffers terribly from dust, debris, skips and scratches. The night scenes are especially terrible. Honestly, the print quality is what you'd expect from a public domain release DVD found at the Dollar Store. I own several Drive-In Cult Classics budget sets that include 10 movies for 5 bucks and they were in twice as good condition as this, and twice as obscure.

The new interview footage with lead actor Baird Stafford really fares no better. It looks as though it was shot with a vaseline-covered lens and transferred at the wrong frame rate--it is so fuzzy and murky and does not look professional at all.

Of course, the film itself is no prize, only gaining notoriety as part of the Video Nasties list. The script is tedious and the acting bad. There are only two scenes that are worthwhile: when Stafford goes lurking about scuzzy 42nd Street and visits a peep show, and the climactic flashback sequence (though it was hinted at so often by the time it was shown in full, it lost some of its power). In fact, the flashback is so expertly scored and edited, is makes one wonder what went wrong with the rest of the film. Every attempt to generate some basic suspense fails miserably, thanks to the script (as when Sharon Smith spots a figure in the window of the Polaroid her boyfriend just snapped of the house). The kills are routine for an early '80s slasher and the kids are all annoying.

There is a commentary with special effects co-ordinator Cleve Hall and some droll, dry comments from Stafford.

The cover art boasts ""30th Anniversary Edition"" and ""No More Than 100,000 will be pressed"". Take my advice, if you wait awhile you should be able to find this thing for under five bucks. If you really want it get it, otherwise borrow a copy or wait for them to start clearing these out.

What a missed opportunity especially the interview with scavolini. I have the old british pre cert of this film and while it is cut the print is a damn sight better than this print and the old video for pleasure dutch uncut version is about the same riddled with marks and lines which prooves they did no cleaning up of the prnt at all. Code red have gone about the same way as MYA communications have, there first few releases are good then they have just gone down hill from there on in, putting out poor releases of some good films.",1313020800,8,1543,4.287671232876712
4492314,3,B004X60QT2,"Was expecting more from this Code Red release after reading all the great reviews on this DVD.
For starters, this movie induces headaches....will I ever wake up from this nightmare!?
Second ALL three versions of this film looked terrible. I expected the 2011 print to look amazing by today's standards. Not so. There was sooo much trash, specks, debris, slices, ect. to distract from your viewing pleasure (or displeasure). I realize this is a ""older"" film shot on cheap film, but come on! Clean the prints up at least.
I admit, the color and clarity was good for DVD, but the other ""junk"" wasn't removed.
And don't even get me started about the interview in Itailian with NO subtitles!! Come on, Code Red...this disc is being sold mainly to an English speaking market. What were they thinking?
Really, do we need THREE versions of the same movie? At least show us the cut version, so we can laugh at the differences. Maybe I am being over dramatic, but there are better movies Code Red could be releasing (The Farmer, for instance) and they waste their time and money on this release. Maybe its just me, but Nightmare is not the great horror movie I thought it was going to be. To each, his own.",1312416000,5,1196,4.593457943925234
4492315,5,B004X60QT2,"I'm one of those who has been waiting for this film to see a proper DVD release ever since the defunct Program Power label announced they were working on it over 10 years ago.  Sure, there has been a cut UK DVD release (from a poor quality master) as well as a bootleg VCD release, but after years of waiting, Code Red finally gives us the real deal.

NIGHTMARE, aka NIGHTMARES IN A DAMAGED BRAIN, is perhaps the most artistic and affecting slasher film of the 1980s.  It's also seriously sleazy and inappropriate for youngsters, going way beyond the R-rating that 21st Century Distribution tried to claim it earned upon its initial release.  Though it has its share of blatant faults (some as a result of interference by the film's producers), it packs a bigger punch than any other slasher film from the era that I can think of.  Sure, flicks like THE PROWLER were nasty in terms of gore, but NIGHTMARE goes a step beyond that and actually manages to be a truly emotional experience.  I have watched this movie maybe 20 to 30 times since I first saw it on video back in the '80s, and believe it or not, I get a bit teary eyed at key scenes even still.

The film's pluses include above average acting from the leads (specifically Baird Stafford, Sharon Smith and Mik Cribben), exceptionally gory violence (let's face it, why else would you watch a slasher film?), an overall vibe of unpleasantness, an obvious love for the material by the director, and a truly exceptional and emotional score by the elusive Jack Eric Williams (why hasn't his name popped up since?).  Minuses include some serious lapses in logic and a few blatantly phony special effects.

As for the DVD, the release had its share of setbacks, and knowing this, it's amazing that we have what we do have here.  There is not one but THREE different transfers of the film, and as others have said, the one you'll come back to is the 16x9 one on the second disc.  All prints used for the transfers have significant damage at the reel changes, but this is by far the best this film has ever looked on home video.  Unfortunately the lengthy interview with Romano Scavolini is not subtitled, but to my surprise, I felt that the other interviews and commentary clarified enough that I didn't feel as if I was missing too much as a result of this.  While the comments from Cleve Hall and Baird Stafford are especially insightful (as is the brief interview with Ed French), it is a shame that Tom Ward's piece (21st Century distributor) as he is interviewed by the film's editor, is essentially worthless.  It is obvious that Ward remembers little about the film's problems getting played, as he states there were no problems whatsoever when in fact the film was cut by many theater owners or projectionists due to complaints or anticipated complaints due to the excessive gore and/or sex.  Having the film's editor's voice on the interview without hearing him comment on the film is a missed opportunity as well.  If you know about the film, you probably know that it went out with the credit that Tom Savini was the Special Effects Director.  The various interviews clarify exactly what roles each effects technician played and how Savini's name got on the credits.

All said, I can strongly recommend this DVD to any fan of '80s slasher films.  I am well aware that for some reason this film polarizes horror film fans -- I have met a few who absolutely hate this movie -- but it really deserves to be revisited, and Code Red's efforts to finally bring it to us should be recognized.",1311984000,10,3546,4.608903020667727

Nightmare follows with over the top gore and splatter in the ranks of The Burning Moon and Blood Rage. The ending leaves you puzzled but you really have to pay attention to every little dialogue and detail I can understand why this was banned and I commend the video distributors sticking to their guns and refusing to edit the footage. 5 stars without a doubt.,1515196800,,462,4.578313253012048

""Nightmare"" or ""Nightmare in a Damaged MInd"" as it was originally known, tells a good story and there's a twist tword the end that's not that surprising but is still satisfying.  The special make-up effects are kind of fake looking but still kind of cool.  If you're an 80's slasher movie fan you should definitely watch ""Nightmare"".",1509148800,,549,4.697916666666667

8446284,4,B004X60QT2,"NIGHTMARE (1981) opens in New York, w/ a man waking up to find a woman in his bed. At least, it used to be a woman, as now it's more like lasagna w/ a head! Ah, yes, we're definitely in Tom Savini country! We quickly realize that it's all a nightmare, being had by a man in a straight-jacket. His name is George Tatum (Baird Stafford), and he's in a mental hospital. Tatum is a schizophrenic, suffering from severe psychotic episodes, possibly brought on by childhood trauma. He's also a multiple murderer. We are shown glimpses of his dark, perverse life. There are some priceless shots of the seedier Times Square of the era. Family friendly? Umm, well... no! We're also shown George's gruesome, red-splattering, homicidal tendencies. Yecch! Savini's very good at this stuff! It seems that George has slipped away from the hospital. Boy, George sure sweats a lot! It's like someone poured a ten gallon fish-tank over his head! Anyway, he's certainly haunted by lasagna woman! He's soon stalking a boy named CJ, while CJ's crabby mom is out on a boat w/ a Tommy Chong lookalike! Several questions jump to mind: What is Tatum's connection to / obsession with this family? Why is CJ so interested in blood, and scaring the $#!t out of people? Where is Cheech Marin? Can Tatum's doctors track him down before he kills again? Umm, well... no! Do not miss the impossibly long, bloody, sweaty ""shock"" conclusion! Gorehundts will love it, even though they'll see it coming from light years away!... P.S.- Tom Savini is indeed THE MAN!...",1503705600,3,1531,4.7593984962406015
