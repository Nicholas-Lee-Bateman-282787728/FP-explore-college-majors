8299349,4,B001ER4COS,"Don't even recall ""You Light Up My Life"". Bought to obtain DVD copy of ""Princess Caraboo"" which is a very delightful classic. Pheobe Cates shows quite unexpected depth in title role. Sheena is okay.",1391126400,,198,4.852941176470588

8299352,2,B001ER4COS,"I was excited to see ""Sheena"" once again presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Although the box clearly states ""Sheena"" is anamorphic widescreen, the disc is pan and scan. When will Sony stop this insanity? Will they issue a new, corrected version? By the way, the two stars in this review apply only to Phoebe Cates.",1231372800,4,326,4.7368421052631575
