8714646,4,B00WZQ0P5M,"Was Eddie Peng the best choice for a portrayal of the venerable protagonist Wong Fei Hung? While at least Eddie trained for 6 months prior to the role, I found myself yearning for someone with an honest background in martial arts. The right man or no, the subtitles kept me busy enough that it was easy to overlook Rise of the Legend's minor flaws. It's clear that some elements of the film are intended for 3D, but these indulgences are not too extraneous for the 2D viewer.

PROs
+ Remarkable cinematography combined with convincing sets/ locations
+ The plot added depth without being cumbersome; more engaging than wuxia plots
+ Sammo Hung brings old skool cred to Rise of the Legend
+ Steeped in Chinese history and culture of the late 19th century
+ CGI was used, but not abused
+ Somewhat reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle/dp/B000F9RB8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle</a>, without the overbearing humor
+ Diverse film score that was usually appropriate (the song during the closing credits is unpleasant, however)
+ Speaking of the end credits, the artwork/ photographs during them makes the film worth watching til the very end

CONs
- While flashbacks were useful in building the plot, they give Rise of the Legend a choppy, muddled feeling, especially for those of us who need to read subtitles as events unfold.
- The first half had the feel of an epic film, but the second half didn't live up to it (almost anticlimactic).
- To hide Eddie Peng's limited skills as a martial artist, ""wire fu"" was added to already over-edited fight scenes.
- If you only are watching for the fight scenes, then you may be disappointed by the long stints between them.",1430438400,,1743,5.090909090909091
