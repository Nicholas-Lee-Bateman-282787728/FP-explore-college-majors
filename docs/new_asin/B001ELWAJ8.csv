8298761,5,B001ELWAJ8,"Amazing video of one of the earlier All-Star groups. Every second of this film is crackling with energy. These people are having fun!! The film is shot with several hand-held cameras and much attention is payed to the rhythm section. With little to no screen time for the horn players or audience.

My DVD has no extras and no choice of audio (I think it's 5.1?)

Celia is only on the first two songs:

With Celia Cruz:
Kimbala
Guantanamera

Without Celia:
En Orbita
El Raton
Me Gente
Guantanamera
Ponte Duro
Fania Theme/Closing credits

I found this text elsewhere on the 'net:

In 1974 Celia Cruz & The Fania All Stars were invited to take part in a 3-day festival in celebration of black sports and entertainment in Kinshasa, Zaire. Their original performance on the first day caused such a hysterical response from the audience that they were invited back two days later for an encore performance. The concert was part of the famous Rumble in the Jungle title fight between the reigning champion George Foreman and the greatest, Muhammad Ali. Their phenomenal performance to an audience of 80,000 people at the Stadu du Hai was shot in 35mm on sic camaras by director Leon Gast (who won an Academy Award for When We Were Kings.) Featuring Johnny Pacheco, Cheo Felicano, Hector Lavoe and Roberto Roena.",1258675200,3,1835,4.694704049844237
