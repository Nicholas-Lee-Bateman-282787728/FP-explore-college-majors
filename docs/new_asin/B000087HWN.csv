1828994,5,B000087HWN,"If you are looking for a refreshing change to classical music based videos, this is it!  I received Country Baby as a gift for my 13 month-old daughter.  Before playing the video, I was expecting the same reaction that we get from the videos in Baby Einstein Series (which my daughter used to love but has kind of grown out of).
Boy was I wrong.  She laughs, dances and talks to the screen throughout the video.  I don't consider myself a true country music fan, but I really enjoy the music.  It's upbeat and driven by the piano and guitar.  What a clever idea to use country versions of kids classics like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and Old MacDonald.  There are some original songs that are really nice to listen to as well.
My 2 1/2 year-old son also loves identifying the farm animals and clever segments that teach the colors of the rainbow.  He asks for ""Country Baby"" at least once a day.  If you have young kids, I would highly recommend this video.",1045699200,3,959,4.434285714285714
7979858,5,B000087HWN,"Wonderful!!!  My son learned his colors by the time he was a year old.  He watched this video in an infants' seat when he was only 3 and 4 months old, and he still loved it when he was 2 years old.  He loves his Baby Einstein collection, but this and Star Spangled Baby are definitely his all time favorites.",1141776000,,308,4.1
7979859,4,B000087HWN,"My 22-month-old was enthralled with this video from the first time she saw it.  As in the Baby Einstein series, adorable toys are featured throughout, and there are also a few babies, the occasional puppet, and some live farm animals (horses, cows, chickens, ducks, lambs) shown.  Emphasis is on colors - there are segments for red, blue, yellow, orange, purple and green.  The background music (no lyrics) consists of Old McDonald, Camptown Races, She'll Be Comin Round the Mountain, On Top of Old Smokey, and Dixie, interspersed with less energetic pieces.  Parts of the music can be a little twangy but not overly so.  All in all, a cute video, with upbeat music and sharp graphics that really appeal to my little girl.",1121126400,,722,4.837398373983739
7979860,5,B000087HWN,My 1 year old loves this video.  He entertains himself by dancing in front of the tv and playing on his own.  I can put this video on and do things around the house with out him ever complaining about it.  I love the way it teaches about the colors and animals.  This is definintely a must have.,1066003200,,295,4.0344827586206895
7979861,4,B000087HWN,"I had to write a review after reading a recent review that says the music is not ""real country"".  We are talking about kids here The video has done a great job bringing the sounds of country music to kids songs.  Introducing our children to ""adult"" country would not be appropriate.
I read about the video in Country Weekly, they seemed to think it was all about Country.  Go figure.
Take it from the kids. My household has 2 and they love it.",1054598400,2,443,4.313253012048193
7979862,5,B000087HWN,"My little girl (19 months)has recently started to talk.  She knows her colors thanks to the Country Baby video.  The music is really nice to listen to and she likes when I sing along with the songs.
It's rare that I don't get sick of watching (and hearing)her videos, but this one's a treat!",1054598400,,291,4.37037037037037
7979863,5,B000087HWN,"I have to say, I was not sure what to expect when I bought Country Baby.  I played it for the first time while watching after my son, my niece and nephew and some neighborhood kids.
The children ranged from  7 months to 4 years old.  From start to finish, the kids were glued to the screen.  I even found myself singing along to the music, which is impossible with our classical music videos, including Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby.
The music is fun.  The kids love watching the puppets and animals.  I have seen a ton of great articles about the video and I agree with the magazines, this one is so unique, interactive and fun.
Try it, your kids will have a ball.",1052265600,2,665,4.28
7979864,5,B000087HWN,"Our family has Barney, Elmo and the whole bit. Country Baby captured my daughter's attention not becasue of one character, but a constant flow of movement and stimulation. She is just learning her colors so this tape has been instrumental in reinforcing them. The farm animals are equisite and the music is relaxing for me too. A buy this as a gift for all new babies since you can't find it it Target or Walmart so its really unique!",1050364800,2,434,4.506329113924051
7979865,5,B000087HWN,"Where do I begin?  This video was awesome!  I was looking for an educational, yet fun learning tool for my two nephews.  Boy, did I find it! I ordered the Country Baby video and I brought it over to watch with them.  Yahooo!, the two little guys were lassoed (sorry, just trying to be cute) into this fun and entertaining video.  Leaving the house that evening and seeing those precious smiles were priceless.  I came to tell all my family and friends with small children, to get their hands on this video.  To no surprise, they purchased Country Baby, and are also raving about it!!  This video is put together in a simple to follow format (Even for Uncle Frankie).",1050019200,,666,4.491666666666666
7979866,5,B000087HWN,"We are guilty. We have almost every video made for our twins. I thought this was going to be another Einstein, but it is much better. The music is wonderful and I sing with my boys who are just mesmerized by it. They are not quite one years old and tehy have really taken a liking to the puppets, animals and clever scenes here. I read about it in American Baby and could not resist - and I cam glad I bought it. ...",1049155200,4,416,3.9642857142857144
