5993627,5,B00FJWM04S,"Times are changing and this show is making it happen. No more fear of who we love just satisfaction as to how we love. This muscle we call a heart can not be persuaded to leave what it feels. Nature is a funny thing. I love how they met, two different era's intertwine here and the generation gap is closing when it comes to luv.",1395619200,2,329,4.076923076923077
5993628,5,B00FJWM04S,Loved the second series and hoping for a third season.  The actors fit the parts and the story is so funny yet serious.  If you loved season one this is a must.  It is even better the story just gets deeper than ever.  A must watch.,1395532800,19,232,3.9782608695652173

Hurry and make it available here!",1395446400,,117,4.363636363636363
5993630,5,B00FJWM04S,"Possibly the most esoteric comedy about life north of the Trent, but absolutely compelling viewing, with superb acting.

5993631,5,B00FJWM04S,Being from another country originally i know all about regions. In other countries people have multizone players. They are hard to get here. British TV is so good. What annoys me is that zoning was never necessary it is all about a profit margin,1394928000,,245,4.590909090909091
5993632,1,B00FJWM04S,"Honestly, I never saw the ""Region 2"" caveat listed with this DVD.  When I ordered it I learned the hard way that not all DVDs are the same.

5993637,5,B00FJWM04S,"I really like this series although one character in particular needs a good smack.  I started watching it on public television but since I'd missed some episodes, I bought the whole season.  It's worth it.",1486252800,,205,4.828571428571428

5993641,5,B00FJWM04S,"Binge alert!  Book some vacation days and begin with Season 1; move directly into Season 2.  Then, order Season 3, being released early 2017.

Drama, comedy, tragedy, family, love, diversity, adversity, secrets, alcoholism, marriage, cougars, murder, lesbians, mistresses, babies born to a teenage mum making a 32 year old Grandmother!

Reed knocks my socks off with her acting skills, her expressions, her presence.  Jacobi is a doll baby of a guy.  We women all want one just like him for our last tango before we cross the rainbow bridge.  This season brings in more stories of the next two generations and draws even younger fans in to cheer for head mistress, the farmer, and their lovers and friends.",1456617600,,563,4.41747572815534

It was a good story about a young boy and girl, who were interested in each other but when one moved away before revealing how they felt; well they didn't meet again for 60 years. Season 1 ended on a good note so I thought that was it, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw season 2, which I enjoyed watching, there was always something happening. Last Tango deals with different types of relationships which as I have gotten older and more mature in my thinking I can appreciate more then I could when I was younger.  I have watched seasons 1, 2 and 3 and am looking forward to season 4.",1441152000,,654,4.266129032258065

5993708,5,B00FJWM04S,Such a fast moving unpredictable plot! You don't have to wait long for numerous plot points to develop and change. The actors and actresses are well cast and the story line is engaging. It's just as quirky and dysfunctional as my own family and friends. I feel like a voyeur who can't look away. I don't want to get caught gawking but I take the chance anyway. I can't wait for the next episode and then the next season. I'm hooked. I hate when that happens.,1439510400,,458,4.337209302325581

5993721,2,B00FJWM04S,"What an enticing 1st Season to be utterly ruined by abnormal gutter filth in the first episode of Season Two - I quit.  By-racial lesbians vividly in romantic poses who want to have a baby and even get married; a daughter who sleeps with the brother of the husband she murdered; a drunk loser academic husband who trashes his own home impregnating a dizzy coworker, the widower who discovers a son from some fling decades earlier;  the daughter who wants money from her widowed mother that believes everything is her dead wandering husband's fault; the child who gets his girlfriend pregnant that everyone else is now responsible for its care.

5993741,4,B00FJWM04S,"This is one of the best TV series I have seen. Season one was superb, I couldn't fault it, but the second didn't quite live up to the very high standards of the first. Disappointingly Alan's character changes from loving and very accepting about Gillian's dalliances to un-accepting and cruel,... very out of character! I like the earlier Alan better! The story of Eddie and the log slitter becomes more and more unbelievable...,and the drama between the various characters has been pushed a little too far... less is better.... but the final scene was magnificent although the resulting comments and reactions show there is still a way to go, series three is definitely needed.",1424217600,,678,4.956140350877193

The characters are very real and engaging, the plots and subplots are not at all predictable and the pace is quick and the action never lags.  This really is the best television series I have seen since EVENING SHADE in the early 1990s. Bully for Britain! and now I'm happy to hear that we may expect a FOURTH SEASON!

The actors are all wonderful (I'd watch Derek Jacobi and Sarah Lancashire in anything) and the filming locations beautiful.  I'd agree with some reviewers that there is almost too much going on in the show to be realistic, but that's part of the fun for me.  It's a real roller coaster of a show and never boring.

For those unused to Brit TV shows, there are some heavy accents and use of dialect that may cause issues for you.  If captions are available I would recommend them.  There is mild sexuality and violence.

I highly recommend both seasons and I am hoping the rumors of a third season are true.",1416528000,,727,4.333333333333333

5993778,3,B00FJWM04S,"I was skeptical they could keep up the fascinating and engaging premise carried in the first three episodes of season 1. Sorry to say the skepticism was justified. Season two quickly turned in to the regular moderate"" fair offered on much English TV.

Part of the disappointment was that the production and writing crew had come up with a great original idea with two first-rate and compelling actors to carry the main characters through their various existential situations. Yes, old people have feelings and needs and wants just as much as their teenage grandchildren.  And a boat load of unresolved issues with their own grownup children. Plenty of material to develop on the strength of good actors. But no, very soon it turns into ""The Archers"" a daily soap opera about ""oop north coontry folk"" - hackneyed situations dragged out of the old room where such scripts go to die. What a shame and a waste of a golden opportunity!

5993798,5,B00FJWM04S,"I absolutely LOVE this series. It is excellently written, fabulously and realistically acted, and beautifully filmed. I love everything about it. Watching Alan and Celia together is so heartwarming and reaffirming. Watching the rest of the family/ies rise and fall with the tides does seem at times to be over the top, but I think many families have more than their share of secrets and dysfunctional qualities. These are no different.

The one thing that does bother me, however, is how Kate treats Caroline at times. I mean, I understand that she is a bit younger, and has been out and comfortable with herself for some time, apparently. But really, if she truly loves Caroline, then she should be a bit more patient with her. Yes, I think I would be wholly upset at being invited to a romantic weekend at a lovely, upscale inn and finding out upon arrival that my girlfriend had booked separate rooms. But really, it's understandable. Look at her family! Look at her mother's initial reaction! And hey, I've been there. You may be comfortable with yourself and where you are personally, but that doesn't mean that you will jut suddenly feel like strutting around proclaiming yourself to the world so quickly. And as I said, honestly, if you truly love someone, and as Kate says herself, are willing to do just about anything for that person, then why can't you be a bit more understanding about your partner's reticence to be public so fast? Some people just need a bit more time to adjust. And hey, that combined with the whole, ""I want a baby right now"" thing would be an awful lot to handle. Aw, I know that they're just fictional characters on a tv show. But it just kind of bothers me that they seem to be trying to make Caroline seem the unreasonable one, when really, I think it's Kate who is being unreasonable, and impatient. But then, that's just my opinion. And even though I do feel this way, I really love the show. All of it. I do really wish that we had television like this in the US. I'm a bit discouraged with our lot as of late.

So, bottom line, if you like really good television and high production values mixed with excellent writing and acting, watch this show. It's fabulous! And though Alan and Celia may be the star characters, in my opinion, it's Sarah Lancashire's Caroline that steals each and every episode. And it does seem to be written with her as the lead character, not her mother and Alan. And, well, it is written by the woman with the daughter's perspective, isn't it. Glad she won the BAFTA last spring, but believe it should be for a lead actress, not supporting.",1413504000,,2607,4.580299785867238

The characters are vibrant and believable, the dialogue is spot on...her rhythm in the story is just perfect.  first time i saw an episode from the first season i rolled my eyes thinking it was just another british soap.  i was wrong.  i gave it another shot by watching the first episode and was hooked.  three generations, all represented fairly and equally with humor as well as drama.  it has everything...and the suspense is perfectly pitched.  please give it a go.  i know if you love the first season you'll love this one.  WELL, except i have a friend who liked first season best, i think i might like second season best.  the fifth episode is my favorite.  my mom's favorite is the last episode. the whole show has even been deemed ""better than downton abbey"" and i must confess i LOVED the first season of downton abbey but i've become disenchanted with each season...but last tango is quite special!  i am looking forward to season 3!!!  and hoping Sally doesn't become unhinged to have to write crap believing that will keep it on the air.

5993859,5,B00FJWM04S,"Alan and Celia were teenage sweethearts sixty years ago, but a move by Celia kept them apart (we learn later what happened).  Both are widowed and their respective grandsons decide to put them on Facebook.  Alan has never gotten over Celia, finds and writes to her and they fall back in love.

The story continues as both their families try to come together.  They both have daughters, born on the same day, who could not be more different.  Alan's daughter, Gillian, owns a farm, is happiest in dirty jeans herding the sheep.  Celia's daughter, caroline is an Oxford graduate, with a PhD, who is the head mistress of a very posh school.  Because of their parents, they try to tolerate each other and see if they can become friends.

Every character in this story is weel written and nuanced. The acting across the broad is exceptional, but Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid are stand outs.  The only thing wrong is that it is only six episodes long.  I loved every minute of this show and have been recommending it to every one I know.",1409788800,,1029,4.543478260869565
5993860,4,B00FJWM04S,"I really enjoyed Season 1 of Last Tango in Halifax, and Season 2 was very good, as well, but not as good as Season 1 since it focused more on the lives of Caroline and Gillian, which were interesting, but to the exclusion of strong storylines for the two main characters: Celia and Alan.  Fine acting from the entire cast.  British accents and colloquialisms are sometimes a challenge when watching, but the Last Tango in Halifax is too good a production to pass up on because of that.",1409788800,,485,4.5

I also have season 1 and never tire of watching them both and look forward to season 3 becoming available as soon as possible!

5993864,5,B00FJWM04S,"It just keeps getting better.  Sally Wainwright (the creater and writer of LTIH) does, indeed, expose the underbelly of family relationships and the secrets that are sometimes kept.

It's long overdue that a television series brings to light the beautiful fact that women do fall in love with one another.  They even have babies together.",1409788800,,338,5.109090909090909

Every line of dialogue, every scene and set, pulls you in, insists that you care for these three dimensional characters. Sarah Lancashire delivers a deep and subtle performance as the school headmistress. It plays perfectly off Nicola Walker's offbeat, strangely sexy, portrayal of the bed-hopping farmer lady. And Anne Reid as the late life lover? As the Brits are won't to say (way to often, by the way, but in this case perfectly justified), brilliant! Hated to see it end.

I'm currently particularly smitten with Sarah Lancashire (Caroline), who I was not aware of until Happy Valley.  But I'm also taken with Nicola Walker, who plays Gillian.

The story of Alan and Celia is inspiring and touching, but the best part may be their delightfully dysfunctional families.  It has a similar flavor to Doc Martin, but the families are more complex and wacky.  I would suggest giving this quirky series it a try:  After two episodes my husband and I were hooked.

From only seeing the title I would probably never have thought to give it a chance.... but a friend of mine asked if I had ever seen it and told me how good it was. Season one was on Netflix and so I gave it a go and OMG! The next day I kept thinking about this program and wondering what would happen next... I finished the first season the next night. I simply could not stop watching it until there was nothing left to watch... I thought that was the end and that I'd have to wait for season two - but then I checked on Amazon and sure enough season two was there! It was even better than season one!  I can't wait for season three, which is in the works as of July of this year.  This British comedy/drama with excellent unforgettable characters is just too good to pass up. Just try it.... you too will be waiting for season three.",1407888000,,855,4.083333333333333

5993965,5,B00FJWM04S,I am a huge fan of British television and have for years watched As Time Goes By over and over. I have finally found a British series that I am equally fond of and have already watched Season 1 twice. The acting is enjoyable and the storyline keeps you watching and wondering what will happen next. I think what appeals to me most is the show makes me feel like I have made new friends and I want to have that cup of tea and find myself being taken aback by their latest antics.,1407888000,,478,4.095744680851064

5993969,5,B00FJWM04S,"This has become a ""do not miss"" series for me. The filming, the script, the characters all make the viewer feel part of either - or both - families.

The reason:  at the end of the last episode at the wedding when the two women were reunited, I think it should have ended there.  The dance and the passionate kissing were disgusting.  Disgusting because it was flaunted in front of parents and children.  I'm as liberal as the next person but I do not like public displays of passion; affection, yes, but keep the rest for private moments.",1407456000,,501,4.522222222222222

5993995,3,B00FJWM04S,"All of the actors are likable, and the scripts are breezy and conversational, and there are family secrets and lesbian affairs and old loves rekindled.  But for all of that, somehow the characters don't connect on any kind of deeper level.  The writing is chatty and engaging, but largely superficial.  The chemistry between Derek Jacobi and his beloved Celia (Anne Reid) seems largely manufactured.  Anne Reid carries most of the weight of the relationship, and she is endearing, but the script simply does not give her enough depth and resonance.  She and Mr. Jacobi seem perpetually distracted by their children, and the scandals that surround them.  (I agree with one of the other reviewers -- could any two families have this many bizarre skeletons?)  It's nice to see Nicola Walker back on the boards.  She does the best she can and invests a largely unhappy character with nuance and depth, at least as much as the script allows.  But she deserves better.  And the lesbian affair between Caroline and Kate strains credulity and comes across as an obvious attempt to seem controversial and hip.",1407283200,4,1100,4.929347826086956

5993998,3,B00FJWM04S,"The 2nd season is entertaining, especially for the acting and the craft of its making, and, we think, worth watching. But it does not meet the standard it set for itself with its first season. The use of dramatic complications to thicken the narrative has become clumsily conceived and rather predictable. The complications come 'fast and furious' and are blatantly conventional cliches. We tried counting them while watching each episode and then had a guessing contest as to which conventionally cliche dramatic complication would come up next. These basic elements of drama, theater, film, television can't be avoided most of the time, easily found throughout this genre's history. But they can be fresh and be so without having to be original. I'm sure that was the intention of the makers of this series. But for us, this season's episodes turned out to be a somewhat rushly forced soap opera, with the bones of its skeleton in full view. Still, having said all that, we enjoyed the circus and look forward to the third season. It's still much better than most of what else there is to choose from on television. Watch it!",1407196800,5,1127,4.875
5993999,5,B00FJWM04S,"The splendid quality that ""Last Tango"" sustained through Season 2 springs once again from the talents of writer/creator, Sally Wainwright.  She richly deserved her BAFTA (Best Writer: Drama) for Season 1, which also took home the prize for Best Drama Series that evening. Ms. Wainwright's writing is nothing short of exquisite - delicate, intricate, intensely human and personal.  It has the feel of being crafted from real-life. It's worth noting that the germ of Wainwright's idea is based on the experiences of her mom, who reunited with and married her childhood sweetheart after being widowed at the age of 75.

Though ostensibly about newlyweds Alan (Derek Jacobi) and Celia (Anne Reid), the powerhouses of the series are their respective daughters, Gillian (Nicola Walker) and Caroline (Sarah Lancashire).  I'm not the only one to think that: these two were the ones nominated for Season 2 BAFTAs, with Ms. Lancashire taking home a nice mantelpiece.",1407196800,,956,5.228758169934641

5994001,4,B00FJWM04S,"This is an addicting TV series.  It starts out simply, with the romantic reconnection of two seniors.  Slowly, we are introduced to their dysfunctional families, who realistically start interacting with one another.  In almost every episode, a new and horrifyingly tragicomic situation is revealed.  Complications and new characters expand the family and siuations each week.  I am enjoying this very much, and can 't wait to see where they go next.",1407024000,29,449,5.267605633802817

5994019,4,B00FJWM04S,"Season Two returned with a pleasing episode, and then, things got a bit sticky. If you have not followed this series, Alan played by Derek Jacobi and Celia played by Anne Reid, in their 70's, were teenage crushes who drifted apart, and then met again 50 years later. They plan to marry when Alan has a heart attack and almost dies. Season Two

This is a lovely story, however, their families become a big part of the story, and, each person has one mess after another befall them. Celia's daughter Caroline, played by Sarah Lancashire, is leaving her adulterous husband, played by Tony Gardner, and in love with another woman, played by Nina Sosanya. Alan's daughter, Gillian played by Nicola Walker, has many secrets, one of which is lovers coming out of the woodwork with their own stories. And, then, the children of the children have quite a few surprises up their sleeves.

However, the main story has to do with Celia and Alan and their plans to get married. Nothing, absolutely nothing is simple for this couple, and, that us what I found annoying this season. Very complicated problems and issues arise for each person. Nothing remains the same, and, yet, things do go 'round in circles. It is a very entertaining show, but exasperating in some measure. Surely, these kind of issues do not descend upon one family in one year. If so, a real family would have been admitted to a state institution for therapy.

If there is a season three, I do hope some realm of stability descends.

5994020,2,B00FJWM04S,"Admittedly, this series hooks the viewer.  The acting is terrific.  The relationship between Celia and Alan is charming.  However, there is a major problem with the writing.  The series veers on melodrama too often.  How much dysfunction could possibly exist in two families?  Well, certainly not this much.  And how stupid are we supposed to believe these characters to be that they tell secrets one to the other again and again after being again and again burned by doing so.  NO ONE HERE KEEPS SECRETS.  And in no world I live in are there so many secrets, so many skeletons in closets in any family as are placed on our plates here.
  And what do we have here?  Well, we have a lesbian couple, a philandering husband, a dead husband who may or may not have committed suicide, a woman who flits from bed to bed with little rhyme or reason, a character allergic to nuts, characters locked up in a haunted house, a man whose next heart attack will be his last, a woman who sleeps with her sister in law's estranged husband and  throw in teenage pregnancy and what you have is a mulligan stew that the writers of soap operas would envy - oh yes, and of course the two families do not share the same social standing.  It can't help but remind me of that godawful MTV series in which the producers gathered the most horribly ill-suited people together to ensure one crisis after another.  One might argue that drama is all about crisis - but the crises should not seem so ""manufactured"" so outlandish.  And if one were to argue that, well, this isn't reality, it's a telly show so one mustn't expect the writers to stick to believable situations.  Well, yes, if it were a slapstick comedy or a work of fantasy that might be true - but it is not.  It passes itself off as a true-to-life drama when it is anything but.  It is not true and it is not life.  Every character is in need of psychiatric care.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  You know the character in Monty Python who, when the skit gets wooly says ""Okay.  That's enough""?  Well, I half expected Caroline's eldest to come marching down the steps on one episode and wonder aloud ""Isn't this all getting a bit silly, a bit over the top?""

 It seems too often that the writers, realizing they must keep it ""interesting"" come up with one silly (because unbelievable) crisis after another.  Out of nowhere, with no preparatory notice, one character has impregnated another and has managed to keep it a secret (REALLY?  In this family?) until the girl's about to deliver the baby. Of course they're only just now filming series three, but I cannot help thinking it is going to turn out that Celia, when a mere girl, went on a murder spree while in an alcoholic stupor and cannot rest until she confides in her son in law John who, it turns out was the illegitimate son of one of those Celia gunned down!!!  And on it will go.  I think if the initial idea of having two elderly people finding one another after years of separation were kept to, if the series had been limited to one two hour show they would have had a winner.  But, if you read this review and think I'm laying it on thick, don't blame me if, while you are watching the show you hear yourself screaming aloud, ""Oh, come on!!! This really is too much""
  Is this all worth watching?  Yes.  Although I stopped after the third installment of series two and will not be watching anymore of it.  With Jacobi, you can put up with a lot.  Is it, with all its faults, better than most of the schlock on television?  Yes it is, but only just barely.  Is it a work of genius simply because they have British accents?  Unfortunately, no.  You want a good, well-written play about a dysfunctional family that does not insult the intelligence reach for ""August: Osage County"". or, better yet, ""The Homecoming"" by Pinter.",1406419200,5,3811,4.465217391304348

5994044,5,B00FJWM04S,"I absolutely love this show! I kept seeing it in lists of BBC series that were available to watch. I'm not sure why it took me a while to decide to view it, but I'm glad I finally did. The acting is, of course, superb. (I mean, look at the primary cast: Derek Jacobi, Anne Reid, Nicola Walker, Sarah Lancashire.) The characters are complex: they all have good qualities to recommend them, but they each commit acts of cruelty and then redeem themselves with kindness. The ones that seem a hot mess are, in some ways, much more together than the ones that appear to have their lives figured out.

The scenery adds further appeal. The story takes place between Halifax and Harrogate. Viewers are treated to country views - complete with sheep bouncing about along the sides of the road - as well as scenes in town. (It's not actually filmed in Harrogate; Altrincham stands in as a substitute.) Trips back and forth between the two locations are not merely incidental to the plot, and I find myself looking forward to the regular road trips.

One downside is that it does get a bit ""soapy"" at times. I think it's hard to avoid this when the plot is centered around the colliding relationships among very different people who are thrust together suddenly. I think it's forgivable. In the end, the overall charm trumps the occasional over-the-top moments.

I highly recommend ""Last Tango."" This isn't one of those shows you have to warm up to. Most people will know whether they're hooked after the first episode. So, if you're at all drawn to it, it's worth giving it an hour. But be forewarned: you probably won't be able to stop.",1405382400,33,1627,4.603448275862069

It's an excellent story about unexpected love and a new definition of what family is.  Esteemed actors Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid  play an elderly widowed couple who find each other again after a missed opportunity as teenagers.
