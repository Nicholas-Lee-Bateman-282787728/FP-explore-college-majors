8756666,5,B01DR3ZUBK,My seven year old is fascinated with Odd Squad but the premier week of the newest movie played and replayed while he was in school so we purchased this DVD as a temporary substitute. We were very happy with the speed of delivery and excellent condition of the DVD. The movie itself is not bad - I actually prefer the show but I am not seven so I still give it five stars.,1474934400,,371,4.095890410958904
