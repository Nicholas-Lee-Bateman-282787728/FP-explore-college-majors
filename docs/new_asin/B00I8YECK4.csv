6254199,4,B00I8YECK4,I don't believe in ghosts. I like the little nooks and crannies of history that this program takes us to.,1431993600,,105,4.3

6254202,4,B00I8YECK4,"Quite entertaining, I wish they had a second season.",1431475200,,52,4.888888888888889
6254203,3,B00I8YECK4,I really enjoyed this but could not figure out why the last 8 minutes or so of each episode were broken snippets of what I'd already seen.  Hum....,1431302400,2,147,4.25
6254204,5,B00I8YECK4,great product,1425945600,,13,6.0
6254205,5,B00I8YECK4,Very entertaining if you enjoy ghost legends and british history! Michaela Strachan is a charming host and her enthusiasm is infectious! Recommended!!!,1420416000,4,151,5.909090909090909
6254206,5,B00I8YECK4,It was very interesting to hear about ghosts in other countries.  I gave the DVD to my friend who has been to England.,1465430400,,118,4.130434782608695
6254207,4,B00I8YECK4,Very interesting.,1460764800,,17,8.0
6254208,4,B00I8YECK4,"Not too scary, leaves more to the imagination, rather than trying to embellish with visual/audio special effects.  The video quality is somewhat poor, and playback skips regularly.",1454198400,,180,5.666666666666667
6254209,5,B00I8YECK4,I truly enjoyed the program.,1453593600,,28,4.8
6254210,5,B00I8YECK4,Given as a gift.  Recipient is happy!,1452556800,,37,4.285714285714286
6254211,3,B00I8YECK4,"Overall a relatively fun series, from what I saw.  I watched two episodes.  Liked the settings a lot, particularly the old buildings.  There was much of the usual cheesy nonsense one would expect in ghost shows, but that was leavened with enough history that it wasn't TOO annoying.  One thing that DID annoy me was in Episode 2, however, when they showed some of the period photographs of the New Inn, with captions like ""C.1800"" and twice, ""C.1809"".  Really?  PHOTOGRAPHS from circa 1800 and 1809?  A full generation before the invention of photography?  That was stupid.  (If you believed the dates on those photo captions, you'll believe me when I say I watched the show on my vintage TV set from 1912.  Duh?)  Weighing the interesting settings against some of the dumber content, I'd average it out at three stars.  Oh, OK... three and a half stars, maybe.",1452124800,4,861,4.743243243243243
6254212,4,B00I8YECK4,"A little chezzy, but the stories have a lot of historical value! Which I enjoy a great deal!",1449014400,,92,4.166666666666667
6254213,4,B00I8YECK4,"A solid documentary, but the host is very chipper. No cheesy re-enactments. A nice vacation planner.",1446940800,,100,5.3125
6254214,5,B00I8YECK4,Very haunting,1446249600,,13,6.0
6254215,1,B00I8YECK4,"This DVD is narrated by a fresh faced, lovely, perky young woman who sounds & seems like she should be narrating a Disney Channel movie for children.  I like my ghost stories narrated by a sinister sounding person.  Couldn't get into it.  I kept waiting for the cartoons to start.",1445040000,2,280,4.56
6254216,5,B00I8YECK4,Love the stories and just the chance it could be true.,1444867200,,54,4.0
6254217,3,B00I8YECK4,Was hoping for something with a bit more 'meat'..... something which did a little more investigation perhaps?,1444176000,,109,5.470588235294118
6254218,4,B00I8YECK4,"Old ghost stories mixed with a bit of British history mixed in. No ghost hunting to bore the viewer as an added plus.
Strange narration with a male voice saying ""I"" and a very obviously female presenter, a strange production choice!",1443225600,2,232,4.682926829268292
6254219,5,B00I8YECK4,Very good series,1443139200,,16,4.666666666666667
6254220,4,B00I8YECK4,Caught my interest immediately.  These were places I had not read or heard of before.  The shows really kept my interest.  I enjoyed!,1442361600,,133,4.695652173913044
6254221,4,B00I8YECK4,"Good series, but a little slow.",1441584000,,31,4.333333333333333

6254223,4,B00I8YECK4,Good movie,1441152000,,10,4.5
6254224,4,B00I8YECK4,Fun show! None of those annoying ghost hunters or goofy music. Just stories about haunted locations.,1440979200,,100,5.3125
6254225,4,B00I8YECK4,a nice haunted  travelogue of Britain,1440633600,,37,5.166666666666667
6254226,5,B00I8YECK4,Very good. But like when  the show actually hunts ghost,1440633600,,55,4.5
6254227,1,B00I8YECK4,"It's always an embarrassment to watch so-called 'ghost hunters' that act like high school boys and girls getting spooked at the slightest sound.  ""Oh my God, did you hear that?  Holy s---, I'm freaking out!  I have to get out of here.""  These are not the reactions expected of a professional investigator of the paranormal.  In addition, the icing on this particular cake was the lead investigator in a hat and sun glasses in almost every scene.  Is he working incognito so the ghosts don't recognize his celebrity status?  (I'm being wildly facetious about this sophomoric looser.)",1440374400,2,582,4.938144329896907
6254228,4,B00I8YECK4,"Being a Brit I enjoyed seeing places that I had either heard of or been to. I was somewhat confused by the fact that a man speaks at the beginning of each episode but in the first person so unless Michaela can speak in a very deep voice and then a normal female voice I have no idea why they did this. Each segment starts with an introduction and ends with ' I was invited inside by .... ' and then Michaela takes over talking to the said person, come on pick one, male or female!  weird .",1440288000,4,489,3.989795918367347
6254229,5,B00I8YECK4,I enjoyed this,1440201600,,14,4.0
6254230,3,B00I8YECK4,"It was okay. The show's concept has been done before in the series ""Most Haunted"". Though this show is far less scarey.",1440028800,,119,4.454545454545454
6254231,4,B00I8YECK4,"Pretty cool unknown show. Not very scary, more historical in nature but still really awesome!",1439510400,,93,5.266666666666667
6254232,4,B00I8YECK4,OK,1438732800,,2,2.0
6254233,5,B00I8YECK4,Love the show! Very interesting and the host is a gem of a commentator. Light on the scary but interesting on the spookie. Very enjoyable to watch and learn history as well.,1438214400,,173,4.4375
6254234,3,B00I8YECK4,"This is a typical  travel type show that shows you where ghosts have been seen. It is not like Ghost Hunters or any show that tries to record real ghosts. I have only watched one episode so my review is based on the first show, which you would think would be one of the best to get you to watch more.

It's interesting if you have nothing else to do and are just wasting time.",1438214400,,376,4.0
6254235,5,B00I8YECK4,"Way cool and fun little series, more than a ""boo-fest!""",1437868800,,55,4.6
6254236,4,B00I8YECK4,Interesting. Fun. Enjoyable.,1436832000,,28,8.666666666666666
6254237,5,B00I8YECK4,If you fascinated by ghosts and history this the show for you. I thoroughly enjoyed the series.,1436745600,,95,4.647058823529412
6254238,5,B00I8YECK4,"Something British this way comes!! Um Yeah, good ambiance and absorbing content!! Love all ghosts of British descent!",1436400000,,117,5.555555555555555
6254239,5,B00I8YECK4,"A note to those who are considering watching this: it is not the usual scary re-enactment type ghost docu-drama. Instead it is a documentary that features the most haunted pubs, hotels, and private residences in the UK with a lot of historical background provided. If you enjoy watching a documentary that features interviews with local historians and provides perspectives that might help explain ghostly sightings and poltergeist activity in these places, then this show is for you. There are no reenactments, instead the format is basically this: a female host goes from place to place, covering the various regions in the UK, and focuses on the most haunted places; she then enlists the help of local experts (historians, owners of the residences in question, paranormal investigators) to help provide tours of the place as they explain the possible causes of the hauntings and point out places where people have experienced supernatural encounters.

I enjoyed this show very much because I'm a self-confessed Anglophile who can only dream of visiting these historic, haunted places some day. The historical background provided on each property as well as the wonderful cinematography makes this a compelling watch. I also loved seeing archival photographs from days long gone by featured in each episode. All in all, I found this show educational and interesting.",1435622400,22,1368,5.275229357798165
6254240,4,B00I8YECK4,enjoyed this show quite a bit. good transfer and good production values,1435363200,,71,5.0
6254241,5,B00I8YECK4,Not ghost hunterish; more like a ghost tour/walk. Funny how a lot of the hauntings take place in pubs/taverns.,1434758400,,110,4.842105263157895
6254242,4,B00I8YECK4,Parnormal short stories if British ghost stories.  I enjoyed the series.,1433808000,,72,5.545454545454546

6254244,4,B00I8YECK4,Great historically based tales,1432944000,,30,6.75
6254245,4,B00I8YECK4,"What I like is the Historical information and the legends mixed together.  It's not a like ""Ghost Hunters.""  It's not a hunt, it's laying it out before you and letting you decide what you believe.  If you like History, you'll like this show!",1432771200,5,241,4.558139534883721
8639976,4,B00I8YECK4,"I really enjoyed this series.  The hostess is personable and very articulate, with a welcoming friendly attitude.  It was a chance to see small town and village UK, not just the usual London or Dublin pubs, etc.  Loved that they had local people telling the stories \ and greatly enjoyed the scenery as well as the interiors of these ""ghosted places.""",1528675200,,351,4.721311475409836

8639980,4,B00I8YECK4,"As a longtime fan of a good ghost story - especially a good British ghost story - I'm enjoying this series a lot. It's fascinating to tour 14th-century inns and unique places like the Hell-Fire Caves and hear ghost tales from people who've had the experiences themselves or know others who've had them - one of the things I like most about the series is that it doesn't exaggerate the stories, they're a lot more believable (and therefore, more creepy) than the ones you hear on a lot of other shows about the paranormal. Michaela Strachan is a good host - she walks that fine line between credulity and skepticism really well, and she's a good interviewer who never talks down to the sometimes-eccentric people she's interviewing. The only things I'd criticize the series on are its sometimes careless use of old photos to illustrate stories - labeling a photo as ""c. 1800"" when photography wasn't invented until the 1830s, for instance - and also very odd quirk it has of having a male narrator doing the voiceover to introduce segments, who speaks as if he's the host who'll be going on the tour when it's actually Michaela who's the host - he'll say ""so-and-so agreed to show me around,"" but then it's Michaela who's being shown around. Overall, though, this show is a real treat for ghost story fans.",1484524800,,1305,4.678260869565217

8639983,5,B00I8YECK4,"It is a straight Ghost Story telling. Unlike the Ghosts Hunters International
and Scariest Places with a lot of screamings and not to mention a taint of
cheating.

Highly recommended!",1475712000,,183,5.1
8639984,2,B00I8YECK4,"Interesting history but terrible cheesy fake ""ghosts"" The lady who narrates is too chipper.",1470009600,,91,5.571428571428571
