8041828,4,B0006J28F0,"This film is great I liked it a lot.
The cinematography is interesting in that there is very little camera movement.
I only recall a few seconds of movement which was either steadicam or dolly following the actors moving.
The director and cinematographer relied on fantastic framing of characters in scene.
The actress is beautiful as well.  What else could you ask for ?
Not sure why people think it is boring.  To note, I enjoy French movies and am a filmmakers, so biased, yes I'm sure ?

8041829,4,B0006J28F0,"At the outset I'd have to state that there appear to be a lot of differently 'rated' versions of this movie available - some of which may have some nudity featured - but I'm reporting on 2 versions I purchased - that didn't.

I bought the flick 'Franck Spadone' as part of my quest for movies featuring the gorgeous Italian actress Monica Bellucci - thus my 'review' is part based on my perception of the overall filmic experience, and part how it stacks up as a Bellucci 'vehicle'. This is a French film (in French w/ English sub-titles) and features a sort of typically quirky European plotline dealing with criminal syndicate action. A young guy ( the titular Franck Spadone) working with a small independent pick-pocketing crew steals a purse belonging to Bellucci's character that contains a diamond she is apparently transporting for her gangster boyfriend, and he becomes infatuated with her - attempting to form a relationship and running afoul of the organized crime group that she is associated with. In general terms all of this action is handled very nicely and the story evolves smoothly with good performances and production values. As a Bellucci vehicle I would give it about a 6 out of 10. Monica plays the, enigmatic, part of a girl caught up in the sleazy crime world and, as always, she looks great. This is, however, not one of her more steamy roles - which may come as a bit of a surprise as much is made of her scene as a stripper. In fact, this film is also released under the title of 'Striptease' in an obvious attempt to cash in on Bellucci's sexy status. Sadly, I have to report that the 'stripper' scene features about the least sexy strip act ever committed to film! The fact that Monica performs such a limp act may be 'forgiven', as part of her 'character' as she is portrayed as being rather disenchanted with her degraded lot in life in the crime scene. There is no nudity in this film - even at the 'climax' of the strip scene the camera 'artfully' pans up as Bellucci drops her bra cheating the viewer out of what they likely bought the movie to see. Monica does appear in a few interesting bits of lingerie, and there's a titillating image of her crouching on the floor at some guys feet that actually turns out to be she's adjusting his pants cuff! SO this flick doesn't really 'deliver' if you're looking for some 'hot' Bellucci action or skin - still she looks great, regardless. As an end note - I actually bought a Euro Region 2 copy of the film under its' ""Striptease' title as well (which often has a higher price tag!) - thinking, maybe, it was a different 'Euro' version with more skin - but, NO - it was exactly the same as 'Franck Spadone' - so don't get sucked into that one! Taken as a whole, this was an engaging little film and I'd recommend it. If you're looking specifically for more naked Monica - the best bets I've found so far are: 'La Riffa', 'Malena' and ""How Much Do You Love Me"". Enjoy!",1306368000,6,2947,4.498134328358209
8041830,2,B0006J28F0,"I bought the Unrated Edition from an e-seller and unfortunately did not view it until well past 90 days.  What I received is actually a so-called Special Edition that is an edited version, down to 1:22 from 1:30, apparently for TV, as there is no nudity in it, and nothing else to warrant an R Rating.  I liked the movie well enough to re-order the actual version I paid for (at my expense) so I have to disagree with the reviews that trashed the movie. As much as I hate the French in general, they do make excellent movies, and this is one, although I want to see the whole movie, not an edited version!  Foreign films are often better than Hollywood films, as they are not predictable in their outcome, they are generally not according to a formula, characters are not all good or all bad, and the good guys do not always win and the ""right"" couples do not always end up together.  See for instance The Apartment, also with Monica Bellucci and Romane Bohringer.  The two stars are only because of the editing.",1303344000,4,1012,4.419354838709677
8041831,4,B0006J28F0,"I shall hope that that in  future transfers of widescreen foreign movies, studios will remember
the placing of English subtitles must be such that we the viewers MUST be able to read subtitles
on widescreen TV sets. IF not, such as the case with FRANCK SPADONE (an otherwise superior neo-noir film),
then we shall forced to watch with bars on all 4 sides of the screen image. Without a big screen,
which fortunately Ido have, then the visible image will be too small. Oh yes, Monica Bellucci is always a sight

8041833,5,B0006J28F0,"A setting in brilliant scene, out of the stereotypes of black film, one finds some environments of films of the new wave. Richard Bean has an elegant cinema.",1186012800,2,157,4.642857142857143
8041834,4,B0006J28F0,"Aaide from Monica Belucci, the cast of this little-known French noir film is unknowns, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Actor Richard Bean--also mostly unknown--steps behind the camera to direct, and the results are surprisingly good.

The title character, along with two cronies, is a pickpocket who finds marks on the Metro (the French subway system in Paris) as well as in hotels, airports, etc. One of the first people he lifts a purse from, in the film, is stripper Laura (Belucci), with whom he is instantly smitten. As it turns out, the club where she works is a hangout for a group of gangsters who plan on taking over the turf of a rival.

One of the best things about this film is the director's judicious use of understatement, cinematically, to develop the story. Rather than the typical overt approach used in American films, he makes use of suggestion very frequently. This makes the film a lot of fun to watch; the viewer has to connect the dots a lot of the time, but because they're not difficult dots to connect, this tends to keep your attention hooked on the film as it takes you deeper into noir territory.

Of course it also helps to have the ravishing Monica Belucci on board as well as the unwitting femme fatale. Obsession, one of the trusted noir standard emotions, is the focus here and Franck's obsession with Laura relentlessly drives this movie, no question.

All the actors turn in fine performances, which, admittedly, is not that tough because Bean (the writer as well as the director) thankfully uses minimal dialogue. This is a great device, contributing to the above-mentioned understated approach to the story development.

A top-notch addition to contemporary foreign noir films, Franck Spadone is definitely worth seeing.",1178928000,18,1773,4.877076411960133
8041835,1,B0006J28F0,I would agree with the previous reviewer. This was very disappointing and boring. This movie is going way back into the cupboard! I don't think I will see it again. A waste of money.,1126310400,8,182,4.382352941176471
8041836,2,B0006J28F0,"this movie is incredibly boring with long scenes that you are supposed to be building intrigue but instead put you to sleep.  the previous reviews are what I based my purchase on and thanks for nothing people.  I only suffered through the whole movie because I thought it had to get better, but no it does not it just stays boring.  If you decide to take the other people opinions and buy this movie, then you think it sucks and is extremely boring half way through, take my advice and don't even finish it.  Also take into account how long my review is compared to theirs.  The whole movie is kind of like an uneventful boring soap opera.  (...)",1112140800,20,646,4.38655462184874
