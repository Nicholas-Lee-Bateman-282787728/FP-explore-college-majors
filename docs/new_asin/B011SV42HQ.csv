8725037,1,B011SV42HQ,"Like several previous reviewers, I bought this and after about 15', it quit.  Refused to play on multiple DVD players and computers.  DVD looked in good condition, just think it was crap production.  Have several other dvds from X Sport that have been great but all I got was 15' of where to line players up and then 30' of nothing.  Don't waste your money.",1503964800,,357,4.446153846153846
