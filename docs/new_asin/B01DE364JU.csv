7711759,4,B01DE364JU,"Hi folks,

I picked this up at a local store today.... and I want to confirm the Trailer for the movie is 4x3 but the film itself is a terrific looking 16x9 anamorphic widescreen.

Aside from how good the film looks....its just plain fun for a western fan who grew up watching this sort.  Many familiar faces from Dean Martin and Brian Keith to the supporting list. Venerable western star Ben Johnson brings authenticity and humor, Honor (Pussy Galore in Goldfinger) Blackman is appropriately cast ...and Denver Pyle is fun in his short appearance. Merlin Olsen (former LA RAM football great) is hysterically funny and quite endearing in his part as the Sargent who is sensitive. The director , Andrew V McLaglen is a true master of the genre of good action westerns as well as humorous ones like this and of course McLintock&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McLintock/dp/B000ITF86E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McLintock</a>
The title song was written by Burt Bacharach and the score by Marvin Hamlish. It almost sounds like Hamlish was trying to copy a Bacharach score (maybe they could only afford a single Bacharach tune) but the score is very much of its time and tips its hand to Bacharachs score from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000EXDS5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;The theme song is sung by Mark Lindsay (Paul Revere and the Raiders fame). Near the end Martins character meets the biggest outlaw in the history of Mexico and HIS name had me hitting the remote to be sure I heard right...its kind of rare and interesting....I should add that while this movie is truly a comedy/western there is a Ramboesque body count at the end ...which is of course bloodless.

I may  be rating this a tad high at a 4.... but I certainly enjoyed it and am pleased to have it in my library for repeat viewing.",1350172800,8,2065,5.563694267515924

So Baker kidnaps a woman off of the stagecoach, only to find that she is the wife of the commandant of the local Cavalry detachment. Things get further complicated when a girl named Dover McBride shows up. She has come to force Baker to marry her and return east, as he promised to do four years earlier. When you have Dean martin, Brian Keith, Albert Salmi, Denver Pyle, Joyce Van Patten, Merlin Olsen how can you go wrong in this very funny western. I don't want to say too much a bout the story because it takes some wonderful twists and the comic lines just keep coming.

7711795,4,B01DE364JU,"The strong cast is the main attraction of this fairly obscure western. Dean Martin is his usual charming self, equally at home in comedy and action. Brian Keith is outstanding as the dedicated Col. Morgan as is Honor Blackman as the wife he sees for a month out of each year. The supporting cast is also quite good, even a clean shaven Merlin Olsen in an early role. The well acted interactions between the various characters keep the viewer's interest up throughout.

The movie is fairly short at 108 minutes but even so there does not seem to be enough plot to fill it. The whole story is set in stone rather early on and there is little development as the movie approaches its climax. I was anticipating several plot twists but nothing ever developed. I finished the movie thinking that surely more story could have been worked in - maybe the Colonel's wife changing hands or some fleshing out of the Mexican bandit leader in his hacienda.

Despite this, the movie is worthwhile and can be recommended if for no other reason than to show how a strong cast can prop up a less than stellar script.",1383004800,,1098,4.540404040404041

7711798,3,B01DE364JU,A movie I remembered vaguely from childhood that viewed later did not stand the test of time or criticism.

7711804,5,B01DE364JU,"This film got a bad rap when it came out  - for suggestiveness and some crude scenes. By today's standards it gets a PG rating - well, maybe PG-13. For years I waited for it to be available on DVD and have already watched it more than once.
My favorite aspect of ""something big . . ."" (that was the original formatting of the title) is the wonderful in-jokes for fans of the Westerns of John Wayne, John Ford and other prominent creators of Westerns of the heyday of the A-Western. Watch for tributes to She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, McLintock! and others of that scope and era.
Dean Martin wants to do ""something big"" out West before returning East to marry his fiancee but he has a dreadful time finding out what to do. Now, if he can find a woman to trade for the big gun, he has a plan. And we all know about the best laid plans.
This film may not satisfy traditionalists but it is pure entertainment. Tongue in cheek humor, Western scenery, a great cast. What more could you want?",1366761600,4,981,4.274193548387097

Might not be a movie for the real yung-uns because of the adult humor,but there is no nudity or cussing. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the theme song and singer. Didnt fit for me. Oh well....... support your favorite artists.",1360972800,3,532,4.793478260869565
7711807,1,B01DE364JU,"I borrowed this from the local library - it had been on my Amazon wish list because of the cast and positive reviews, but I'm deeply grateful I didn't waste money on it.  It's a mess, and can't decide whether it's a comedy or an action film. I assume that the positive reviews are based on having enjoyed it when about ten years old, which would be understandable.

Other people have written about the plot, so I won't, but there are no real laughs, although few scenes are somewhat amusing. It has some embarrassingly bad ones, though, including the usual pointless barroom brawl (it's a McLaglen film, so there'd have to be at least one).  This takes place in a saloon on an army post!  That's ludicrous even in a comedy western (as is Brian Keith's synthetic fitted uniform shirt).

After all the tiresome shenanigans are done, there's a horrible shoot-'em-up scene in which dozens of faceless Mexicans are slaughtered with a Gatling gun (one which fires endlessly without reloading; in fact, more than one man was required if reloading was to be carried out).  This murderous scene is entirely out of keeping with the preceding ""humorous"" material.  Perhaps McLaglen wanted to emulate ""The Wild Bunch"" finale, or thought he was poking fun at it.  If so, he failed miserably on both counts.  If his intention was to parody the Ford cavalry westerns, as one person here suggests - I think it's very dubious - he failed horribly there, too.  ""F Troop"" did it better.

Oh, and I mustn't forget the title song, which one person here calls ""terrific"" - it's awful, and plays over a boring, drawn out shot of galloping horses.  The editing of this film is even worse than the direction - and that's poor.

It's sad to see Dean Martin, Brian Keith, and Ben Johnson wasted in this dross - though they must've been glad of the cash.  Martin is likeable, as usual, until he starts killing people, but the best male performances are by Albert Salmi and Robert Donner.  The female female characters - Honor Blackman and Carol White (yes, she of ""Up the Junction"" and ""Poor Cow""!) - manage to raise the tone a bit.

It seems the Gatling gun was the kiss of death for several movies (at least two horrible western films bear that title), as well as for the Mexican corpses in this film. The concluding scenes of ""The Wild Bunch"" must be an exception.  For laughs, stick to ""Blazing Saddles"" or, at a pinch, the James Garner vehicle, ""Support Your Local Sheriff"".  For action - take your pick.

Having said all that, I'll have to agree with others that the transfer is surprisingly good, on the whole, apart from one scene towards the end that has so many flaws in the film it looks as if there's a snowstorm.  If it weren't, the thing would be unwatchable - as the trailer on the disc bears out.",1358812800,,2784,4.574596774193548
7711808,4,B01DE364JU,"I hav always thought Dean Martin was the essence of cool, he has made other westerns and this one is pretty good, I recall when it came out in the 70's I bought the tie -in paperback and was never able to see the moie.  So after 35 years or so I got it it is a 70's action/comedy/western and is pretty good in that respect.  It won't win any oscars but is a good lazy sunday afternoon movie.

7711810,5,B01DE364JU,"AT LAST! My wife and I saw ""Something Big"" on TV about 30 years ago and we never forgot it. Finally, FINALLY we can see it again!

Dean Martin's time as a wild west bachelor is coming to an end. He has been looking to do ""something big"" for years and his betrothed is sick of waiting. He has one week to make his mark. Meanwhile, Brain Keith almost steals the show with his hysterical low-key role as the retiring commander of a local cavalry  troop. His wife, too, is coming to take him back east. And Albert Salmi puts it all together as a desperate desperado in search of a ""woman"" in exchange for a Gatling gun. What could possibly go wrong?

A unique and almost surreal Western that still stays true to that old-school Western motif. Funny a heck, it is hard to tell who is the outlaw. Some side-splitting moments that will make you fall out of your chair. A wonderful mix of A, B and C-level actors.

Favorite line: ""You going to bury your friend?"" ""Um, maybe something will come down from the hills tonight and drag him off.""

Looks great on my 50"" plasma; fills the screen, NOT cropped to old-fashioned TV format. A fun and under-appreciated gem. You'll be glad you bought it.",1352419200,11,1184,4.3881278538812785
7711811,4,B01DE364JU,"I saw this movie when it was first released and the reviews were mixed to downright savage. What reviewers seemed not to realise was that Andrew McGlaglen was an afficianado of John Ford. His father, Victor, acted in many of his films. Something Big was an affectionate parody of Ford's cavalry films, mostly with John Wayne and most of the supporting cast of Something Big. Not meant to be taken too seriously, the film was a vehicle for Dino who was huge on American TV and most other media at the time. It was lambasted for poor taste but compared to what has been released onto the public in recent times it is almost Disneyesque by comparison. 3/4 stars for entertainment value. The one jarring note of the movie was Carol White's Scottish accent but it was no worse than Dick Van Dyke's Cockney accent in Mary Poppins and I enjoyed both films in spite of dodgy accents!",1351209600,12,875,4.544303797468355
7711812,4,B01DE364JU,"An outlaw (Dean Martin) and his gang need a Gatling gun in order to rob the treasure of an infamous Mexican bandit (Jose Angel Espinosa). To this end, he makes a deal with a grungy and lonely bandit (Albert Salmi) to get him a woman (women are scarce in the territory) in exchange for the gun. Martin holds up a stagecoach and kidnaps a woman (Honor Blackman, GOLDFINGER) for the lonely outlaw. The problem is ... she's the wife of a Colonel (Brian Keith) in command of the regional cavalry. Comedy westerns are hard to pull off unless they are of the satire/parody kind like THE PALEFACE and BLAZING SADDLES so it's a pleasant surprise to discover this engaging sleeper. It manages to balance its subtle humor without making a shambles of the genre. I don't want to overpraise it, it's rather modest in its aims and execution but I can't deny I was quite taken with it. Martin, playing it fairly straight, is at his most appealing and Keith brings his own brand of solid magnetism while the leading ladies (Blackman, Carol White) are charming. There's a terrific title song by Burt Bacharach and Hal David that the film's composer Marvin Hamlisch incorporates generously into his underscore. With Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Denver Pyle, Paul Fix and Joyce Van Patten and Judi Meredith are hilarious as a pair of dangerous, man hungry sisters.

8755631,3,B01DE364JU,"RELEASED IN 1971 and directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, ""Something Big"" is a tongue-in-cheek Western starring Dean Martin as aging outlaw, Joe Baker, who unknowingly kidnaps the wife (Honor Blackman) of a cavalry commander (Brian Keith) in order to obtain a Gatling gun from a scumbag gunrunner (Albert Salmi). Ben Johnson plays a scout while Carol White appears as the wannabe fianc of Baker.

The title refers to something big that Joe Baker is supposed to do before retiring from outlawry with several of the characters citing the line; a quaint idea, but its not funny and gets old after a while. The opening act is a dud with nothing stimulating happening to draw the viewer into the story. There are several curious props (a skeleton, a dog, bagpipes and a peg leg), but they fail to stir much interest. Things finally perk up in the second half, but not enough to save the movie.

One huge problem is the idea that this antihero were supposed to like is engaged in something way too unsavory (kidnaping the innocent wife to offer to the odious gunrunner, which amounts to slavery). Martin was able to get away with this type of character in the excellent Bandolero! (1968) because his crimes weren't so abhorrent; not so here.

There are some good bits, however, like the two man-hungry women living in the remote wilderness (Joyce Van Patten & Judi Meredith). Nevertheless, its obvious why Something Big has been condemned to cinematic obscurity, never being released to VHS and barely making it to DVD in 2012.

As a kid, I couldn't accept him as a gunman in ""Rio Bravo,"" let alone a brother to John Wayne in ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" or Jimmy Stewart in ""Bandolero.""

travels with a dog"" struck me funny. Ben could nail drama (""Shane,""!""One-Eyed Jacks""), but he has me chuckling throughout this movie like the so-called sidekicks were supposed to but seldom did. Martin, Keith and Johnson are just highly entertains to watch.",1497830400,,1024,4.688888888888889

8755637,5,B01DE364JU,I was at the priemer of this movie in Las Vegas when I was 18 yrs old and in the USAF. Some of the actors was there also. I spent many years looking for this movie.,1475020800,,164,3.5833333333333335
8755638,5,B01DE364JU,"So far,no reviews for the blu-ray version of this movie - so,here goes. If you have a soft spot for well crafted western's in the '60's and '70's,(when there was a proliferation of the genre),this will be a well deserved addition to your western blu-ray library. Did not know what to expect,as I never caught up with this,when I was younger - so,what a pleasant surprise to view it for the first time. No need to go into the story details,as others have covered that already,but Dino was just delightful in this role,and it was tailor-made for him. The cinematography,(from Harry Stradling Jr.) was superb,and ideally suited if you have a large screen TV - in addition the blu-ray transfer is just stunning. Normally,I am not such a big fan of comedy/western,but this just works,and seems as fresh today,as when it was first shot in 1971. If you enjoyed,""Bandolero!"",where Dino starred alongside James Stewart,and Raquel Welch in 1968,(also available in blu-ray),then you will really appreciate this.",1475020800,,1000,5.030120481927711
