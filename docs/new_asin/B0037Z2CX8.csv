8390907,5,B0037Z2CX8,"This video is a well researched doccumetary about a wonderful man who I was proud to call my friend.  Michael Bavaro went to great lengths chasing down well known people whose lives were forever changed by their exposure to Rex Trailer, as well as rare photos, video clips and more.

You'll enjoy comments from the likes of Jay Leno, Jimmy Tingle, Mike O'Malley, Boston Mayor Tom Menino, Tom Bergeron, Channel 5 WCVB's Heather Kahn and many more, all sharing their fondest memories of Rex.  Some were on Boomtown as children, others had the opportunity to work with him, still others were his students at Emerson in Boston, but everyone shared the utmost respect and admiration for the man who brought a little bit of the old west into our living rooms as kids back in the mid fifties and beyond.

Rex left us earlier this month at the age of 84.  I was privilaged to have attended his 84th birthday last fall, which was a standing room only crowd at the town hall in Ayer Massachusetts.  If you're a Rex Trailer fan, I suggest you get a copy of this while they're still available.  It will bring you back to a place in time guaranteed to put a smile on your face.  Who knows...perhaps you or someone you know is in the video!  Trust me when I tell you...it's worth EVERY PENNY of the asking price.

Rest in peace Rex...you won't be forgotten.  Your memory will live on in all of us who were touched by your kindness and wonderful personality.",1358553600,3,1443,4.490421455938697
