8516202,5,B007G8SE9S,Loved this show. Glad I found the DVDs. Wish Amazon would make other cancelled shows available.,1406332800,,95,5.0
8516203,4,B007G8SE9S,"I was very skeptical at first about watching a half-hour sitcom starring a major NFL icon such as Michael Strahan but I was definitely impressed by the comedic timing that he shares with the rest of the cast (including TV/film veteran Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell). Like most recent new shows was cancelled abruptly. This was very disfortunate since the show was actually very funny.",1363219200,2,377,5.0
8516204,5,B007G8SE9S,"I'm a big fan of Chill Mitchell, but an even bigger fan of CCH Pounder (since the 80's). Really cute show-- cleverly creative and funny-- great cast! Too bad it was only on for one season. Glad I purchased.",1355184000,2,206,4.3076923076923075
