8301366,1,B000ESTUZY,"Well, as the title reads, Basic Blue Screen And Green Screen PHOTOGRAPHY simply had absolutely nothing to do with PHOTOGRAPHY but everything to do with videoing I truly hated this purchase and would like a refund to be perfectly honest!",1367884800,,236,4.925
8301367,5,B000ESTUZY,Having bought this instructional DVD when it was sold from the publisher I have to comment that this DVD packed with info and is more deserving of positive feedback than what the earlier reviewer might indicate.  The DVD is about video or motion picture chromakeying concepts and has some very good real world examples which I found extremely helpful.  Now that everyone has some kind of movie camera on their celphone or digital still camera I believe this still would be very helpful to anyone who wanted to learn some basic keying techniques.,1320624000,2,545,4.849462365591398
8301368,1,B000ESTUZY,"I purchased this DVD with the assumption it would pertain to digital STILL photography, however it is specific to motion photography (videography).  The product description ""Whether you want to shoot your own Blue and Green Screen to composite or just familiarize yourself with the terms and techniques"" also leads to an inaccurate depiction of this product.  If you're looking for information on compositing still photography, this is not the resource for you.

If you're looking at working with MOTION photography, this might be a decent and fairly cheap primer which also includes PDF's of lighting diagrams, a glossary, and a resources file, although, most (if not all) of this information could probably be found with an online search.",1288137600,2,740,5.254237288135593
