8251126,1,B0013IZL48,"I too purchased this because it stars Ben Silverstone who was incredible in GET REAL, but Im sorry to say, this is a stinker of a film.
The acting is about as bad as you can get  probably due mostly to the incredibly poor script.  The sets and designs are Disney-like antiseptic and lack all sense of reality.  And whats up with the American accents?  Why not leave the Brit actors with their Brit accents??  I had to purchase this film from Europe since it was never released in America.  Now I know why.  Patrick Swayze probably did everything in his power to make sure this film was never shown in the States.  As much as I like Ben Silverstone (who left acting after this film), I have to say, this film is bad  very, very bad.",1407196800,,731,4.2773722627737225

8251128,5,B0013IZL48,A true story drama about a young Jew male accused of his father's murder while they were on a hiking trip and the corrupt trial he received which was normal for Jews at that time.  Patrick Swayze was awesome in the role of his attorney who defends the young male and has the jail term pardoned.  Is an excellant movie and Patrick at his best.,1282003200,2,342,4.246153846153846
8251129,5,B0013IZL48,"This movie is incredible on so many levels. It is a powerful true story that brings to the forefront many issues that are timeless--prejudice and the fight against prejudice, and hope and the fight to follow that hope. I think that this is one of Patrick Swayze's finest performances. I thank Joshua Sinclair for this amazing movie.",1264896000,3,332,4.842105263157895
8251130,4,B0013IZL48,"I purchased this film because Ben Silverstone was in the cast. Ever since his amazing performance in GET REAL I've been a major fan. How pleased I was to see him give yet another fully dedicated, intelligent performance. He's one of the best actors Britain has given us in the past 10 years - why is he not working more often? There should be two dozen Ben Silvestone movies by now. Thanks to him I got to know more about this fascinating true story.",1244073600,4,450,4.369047619047619
8251131,5,B0013IZL48,"Luckily rich of family contacts having him established and secured a job in New York, a twenty-something photographer is blessed with a daddy, abusive, egocentric, sex driven eating-liking egoist complicating lives of wife and kids to an unspeakable degree with his arrogance and demands (say: mishigases) not special for Jewish husbands and fathers at all.

A movie stands apart from a range of the wrong-accused stories and simply court dramas both conceptually, and artistically: although anti-Semitism of early-twentieth-century Nazi-flirting Austria is a weak excuse for a way juries sometimes worked and work, it is a significant realistic work of Philippe Halsman the most famous later for making the pictures of celebrities jumping.

Even avoiding this sort of family dramas on historical landscapes (see: Three Colours, or Twelve Angry Men, or Philadelphia for instance) is hardly immune to highly recommend this professional work for viewing.",1235606400,3,952,5.604166666666667
