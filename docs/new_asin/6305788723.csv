7894990,5,6305788723,"This new video consists of Renata Tebaldi's three appearances on the BELL TELEPHONE HOUR. Contains Tebaldi at the VERY height of her powers in FIVE of her most memorable roles. First, Madama Butterfly, two arias in costume,  and in color. For 1959 this is a VERY rare thing. Tebaldi's beauty, both  physical and vocal come through magnificently!  It's no wonder that some  people consider her the greatest Butterfly! And you will see her perform  these arias up close, and live. You will ALSO be treated to COLOR TOSCA and  ADRIANA excerpts. These are VERY rare, and have only appeared on several  foreign ""compilation"" tapes. It's wonderful to see them in  glorious color and sound. Again, it's like you are in the front row of the  Met! The other two are GIOCONDA, which Tebaldi had enormous success with at  the Met, as well as Naples. She is shocking here, as the role calls for. A  brief interview is included, and contains ""Voi lo sapete"" from  Cavalleria Rusticana, a role she never performed on the stage. However her  recording with Bjoerling and Bastianini ranks up there with the MOST  classic recordings of an opera -- EVER. Don't let this terrific video pass  you by, as it will bring you many, many hours of pure enchantment.",953078400,10,1239,4.751173708920188
