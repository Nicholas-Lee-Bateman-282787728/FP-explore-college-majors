The video extras (old concerts were good) a 3 cause I don't care for videos. The concert production and mixing 3. My personal taste for the band a 5. This averages to a 3.5 star. That being said, I listen to this more then others. Im bumping this to a 4.",1519776000,,362,3.9726027397260273

Great DVD Emil, well deserved.",1242864000,2,301,3.870967741935484
