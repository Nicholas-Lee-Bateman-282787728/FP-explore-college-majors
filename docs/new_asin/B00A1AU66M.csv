5375019,1,B00A1AU66M,"Its a Great movie for its time of the turn of the century.
David Wayne is excellent..
However the visual quality stinks because of its ""On Demand"" DVR-R
system of recording.
I think these recordings are done on a computer system resulting in extremely high contrast.
The picture is terrible resulting in no enjoyment of the movie.

5375020,4,B00A1AU66M,"I remember first seeing this movie when I was very young, probably about 9 or 10 (in other words, over 45 years ago).  Now, to watch a movie at that age and to have it stick in your mind for this long as being a good movie, there has to be something special about it. While my memory was a bit fuzzy on just what it was precisely about this movie that causes me, even all these years later, to still remember the title and to remember it was a movie I liked, I bought it anyway, just to watch it once again and perhaps spark those memories back to life.  I am very glad I did.  I still love watching the progression of the town, and the people along with it, some for the better, some not so much, but all done with a certain nostalgia without the usual schmalz that can so often ruin these travels back down memory lane.  This story is more hard edged, with its share of petty hatred, manipulations, and yet also close caring relationships as well.  These are all played out against the progress of our great society, with glimpses of our greatness, while not bothering to hide some of the warts as well.  This is a movie that young and old can still appreciate and is well worth the price of admission into a small glimpse of America's great past including some of the accompanying growing pains.",1359763200,6,1298,4.277551020408163
5375021,1,B00A1AU66M,"I saw that movie at the French Cinematheque 20 years ago. It was a splendid bright Technicolor movie. Leon Shamroy (the photographer) should be quite broken-hearted if he could see that slaughter !
My advice : don't buy it. It's a real deep sadness.
All the copy seems to have been shot in a ""day for night"" version. Even when the sun shines bright...
So, wait till the sun shines , Nellie!...  and may be we'll be seeing you in a better shape!",1358985600,6,444,4.349397590361446
5375022,2,B00A1AU66M,looked forward to see this movie for many years.see being the key word here.extremely dark picture.fox are you kidding me?,1358640000,7,122,5.15
5375023,3,B00A1AU66M,"I first saw this film in 1997 in a film class and fell in love with it. It's a very sad and depressing film, just like I like 'em. The transfer to DVD has made the film very dark and it's hard to see the actors. Having said that, I would still buy it. What a great commentary on living a simple life.",1358035200,10,300,3.7777777777777777
5375024,2,B00A1AU66M,"Film arrived in perfect condition, however, THE ENTIRE BEGINNING OF THE FILM WAS BADLY TRANSFERRED COLORWISE.  THE TV WAS ADJUSTED AS TO COLOR, BRIGHTNESS and EVERYTHING ELSE WHILE THE FILM NEVER COULD BE CORRECTED COMPLETELY.  THE COLOR RED WAS ALMOST NON-EXISTANT, YET HEAVILY USED IN THE CREDITS AT BEGINNING.  BAD TRANSFER, otherwise, ok story.  Both Jean Peters & David Wayne always rose to the occation no matter the film.",1357948800,6,428,5.159420289855072
5375025,5,B00A1AU66M,"This is the story of a young ladies ability to deal with survival in an up and coming town in Illinois.  She is tricked by her new husband into agreeing to live there, until they can save enough money to go to Chicago.  Her husband played brilliantly by David Wayne, is secretly planting roots in this small, off the beaten bath community. Nellie discovers her husband's secrets and runs away.  This is the turning point in the film which is essential to the lives of the family and striving community she leaves behind.  Definitely worth watching.",1357084800,6,548,4.677083333333333
5375026,4,B00A1AU66M,"This one is strange. It is full of wonderful nostalgia with a winning Jean Peters and David Wayne, but in the middle, it gets sad and sometimes depressing. Yet, on the whole, it is a very good movie. Despite the title song, which is sung often, it is not a musical.",1355529600,6,265,4.215686274509804
5375027,5,B00A1AU66M,"This is one of those films that practically never plays on TV -- the last time it was on TV that I know of was back when American Movie Classics (AMC) was still a non-commercial films-only channel....that long. And to the best of my knowledge, it was never released on videocassette. So, I had little or no hope of ever seeing it on DVD. It's a delightful film -- if you ever saw it years ago and are asking, ""Is it as good as I remember?""....yes, it is.

I've got a whole list of old movies that haven't been out on DVD yet....this one coming out gives me hope for the others.",1354060800,16,577,4.151785714285714
5375038,5,B00A1AU66M,Movie was filmed near my home.  I know many of the extras that are in the movie.  For that reason I love it.  As a film-maybe a c-.,1415577600,,131,3.607142857142857

5375040,4,B00A1AU66M,This movie stuck in my mind ever since seeing it back-in-the-day.  Watching it again was a real treat in how the whole was perceived then versus now.,1405900800,,149,4.518518518518518
5375041,5,B00A1AU66M,great movie.  excellent condition.  arrived on time.  a slice of Americana with good acting ad an entertaining story.,1404777600,,117,5.388888888888889
5375042,5,B00A1AU66M,I love this movie and did not find it too dark as some viewers did.  I will be watching this at least once a year and I'm so happy that I was able to find it.,1387929600,,158,3.388888888888889
5375043,3,B00A1AU66M,This film is exactly the best in its quality of color. The Fox Studios need to contact Warner Bros to get instructions. It is a shame that Fox sells in their Cinema Archive line the widescreen movies not in widescreen. Anyone knows that Fox actually helped to invent CinemaScope and now they can issue these movies in the lousy full screen versions? Is that what they think of us collectors?,1379721600,4,391,4.6
5375044,1,B00A1AU66M,"This is a wonderful film and Fox has ruined it with this horrible DVD-R presentation. It is hard to see, especially night scenes or in rooms. What is wrong with Fox?",1377388800,6,165,4.354838709677419
5375045,2,B00A1AU66M,"The story is excellent but the quality of the dvd is very poor - those who did the transfer from film to dvd should be re-trained
on how to make an acceptable copy.  This dvd is so dark that most of the scenes have little clarity.  When I first saw this film
on tv many years ago it was in black and white and very clear to view. The current dvd needs to be redone.  Hopefully this dvd
will be redone and made more viewer friendly.  In its present state I wouldn't recommend this dvd to anyone !  Jim Mathes",1365465600,9,507,4.03
5375046,5,B00A1AU66M,Movie story was good.  Dissapointed in the quality of the movie when they transformed it from black and white to color.  Not too clear in color.  Some of the movie is too dark to see.  Not as clearly as it should be.  Had seen this movie on tv a long time ago and the movie was clear all the way thru.  Would like to have a more corrected copy sent to me. at no charge since I already paid quit a bit for it the first time.,1363564800,3,423,3.8045977011494254
5375047,1,B00A1AU66M,"This is one of my all time favorite films and I have a 30 year old copy from tv that is better than this disc. 20th Century Fox better get on the ball if they ever want me to purchase another one of their dvds. This one is pathetic (dark and murky).
Give it a wide berth",1362182400,6,270,3.754385964912281
8546059,5,B00A1AU66M,"I had watched 'Wait 'till the Sun Shines, Nellie' over 25 years ago and was so excited to have found it after all of this time. The movie is a wonderful presentation of life from the beginning of a marriage through the challenges, situations and effects of life events on a family during the early half of the 1900's. It is a favorite of mine and I am sure it will be of yours as well.",1506556800,,385,4.078947368421052

8546061,4,B00A1AU66M,I remember seeing this movie on late night TV back in the mid 60's and for some reason it always stayed with me.  The reproduction quality as stated by others does leave something to be desired but it doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the film.  I really enjoyed the story line and the acting although no big name Hollywood stars are featured.  It was fun to see this movie again.,1488844800,,394,4.36986301369863

8546065,5,B00A1AU66M,"Fantastic Movie!  The only problem is you need a flashlight to see it.  I've always been a big fan of the movies that 20th Century Fox made in the forties and the fifties.  It is a crying shame that 20th Century Fox does such a poor job of transferring their Cinema Classics to DVD.  Hopefully , some day in the near future 20th Century Fox will get their act together and reissue a better transfer to chumps like us who purchased this DVD.",1454284800,,440,4.265060240963855
