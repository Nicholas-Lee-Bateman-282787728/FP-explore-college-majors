I can't find that fact anywhere in the description, but in retrospect it makes sense. Since this is my fault, I can't give it a bad review.
It's too bad, because I have a fan for years and if it's anywhere near as good as the CD set Zeitgeist @ RAH, then it's easily 5 stars.",1408752000,2,306,3.9516129032258065

 Outstanding recording, outstanding performance. The 3 hour song selection is good with a few boring tracks in between. The track 'Halloween Cast' is impressive watching this lovely babe banging away on the drums. Yes, this women can play drums.

 A Must Have, for Tangerine Dream fans. A excellent sampling of electronic new age music for those new to Tangerine Dream.",1315612800,2,394,4.924242424242424
