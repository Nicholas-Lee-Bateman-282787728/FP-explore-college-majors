8110878,5,B000ELJ3FI,"I bought this DVD/CD combo about 4 months ago.  The instructions state that you should watch the DVD EVERY DAY FOR 30 DAYS!  If you miss even one day, you have to start all over.  The first month I had it, I would miss watching the DVD a day here or there.  I finally stopped trying, because I felt that it wasn't working.  But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I was NOT FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS!  So the question was, do I REALLY WANT to quit, or am I not watching it now & then and using that as an excuse, saying it doesn't work?
So I tried it again, watching faithfully EVERY DAY.  I even loaded the CD onto my MP3 player & I would turn it on repeat before I went to sleep every night & listen to it all night long.  I've smoked for over 35 years, at least a pack a day, most times more.  I've been smoke free for 2 months now.  This does work, if you REALLY WANT TO QUIT SMOKING!  If you already have preconcieved notions about subliminal messages & don't really want to quit smoking, this isn't going to work for you.  You need to approach this with an open mind & you will have WONDERFUL results.  I can't even honestly tell you what the specific date was I quit, because it was such a subtle shift for me!  I only know that it was the in the first week of June sometime, because of something that had happened after I noticed that I had even quit!  I think that is truly amazing.  I DID NOT REALIZE RIGHT AWAY THAT I HAD STOPPED SMOKING, because the powerful suggestions in this DVD/CD are so powerful!  If you are really rigid & refuse to believe that if you can't touch it & capture it, it's not real, I feel bad for you.  With all of Steve Murray's DVD's, Books & CD's (which I ESPECIALLY LIKE!) all these things are possible.  It's just like believing in God.  You have to take some things on Faith, and this DVD & ALL of Reiki are some of those things.  There is much more to our world that we have the capacities to understand or realize!",1311724800,,1973,4.099216710182768
8110879,5,B000ELJ3FI,It worked.  What else can I say.  If you want to quit smoking watch this video for 30 days.,1275264000,,91,3.736842105263158
8110880,1,B000ELJ3FI,"Subliminal messages don't work, period. It's all a myth. I saw this video  and let me tell you, I've gotten better results by simply watching short anti smoking clips from YouTube than this DVD. Even a quick reading from any anti-smoking website will be 10 time more helpful. I started trying to quit for real about 2 weeks ago and it's been a week now since my last cigarette, and I can honestly say this DVD didn't help at all.",1232236800,,429,4.3625
8110881,5,B000ELJ3FI,"I used the subliminal program along with the prescription drug Chantix, and I can happily report I haven't smoked for one month.  The best part, quitting was pain and stress free.  I highly recommend this product!",1189036800,3,213,4.888888888888889
8110882,5,B000ELJ3FI,"This worked for me. The second day I lit the cigarette but I couldn't pull, I felt as if the smoke is killing me. Immediate reaction was to throw the cigarette and now I don't feel like smoking anymore, touchwood

update 05/11/07-  Its been more than 7 months now since i watched this DVd and quit smoking. I haven't had the urge to smoke again and i am a non smoker now. Thanks Steve",1160352000,10,384,4.175675675675675
