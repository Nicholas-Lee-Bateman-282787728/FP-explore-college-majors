7596255,5,B01A9QY5TG,The musical with Robin Williams remains funny and enchanting . Great for kids and whimsical adults. Disney often stops production of their films so get it now if you want it.,1521849600,,174,4.645161290322581
7596256,4,B01A9QY5TG,"Great movie but don't like the format.  With other DVDs and Blu Rays you are prompted to start the movie where you left off or start from the beginning - this one doesn't allow for that.  If this is a feature you need, like our family does, then skip this format.",1518393600,3,263,4.137254901960785

8746781,5,B01A9QY5TG,"Works just fine, North America EST zone. I did notice some coloring off... one of the street vendors, towards the beginning,  when Jasmine gives a kid an apple... the vendor's hat (part of the hat) appears to be colored the same as his skin... Not sure if original defect or this version... Regardless, movie plays, works great, my kid's happy and its not priced at a ridiculous amount like many of the other classics.",1535328000,,418,4.648648648648648
