805895,5,6304202377,I LOVED THE MOVIE PADDLE TO THE SEA AS A CHILD IN THE 1960'S.  I AM LOOKING FOR THE OLD MOVIE VERSION FOR MY OWN CHILDREN AND CANNOT FIND IT.  I HAVE NOT SEEN THE 1996 ANIMATED VERSION.,944179200,18,185,3.8421052631578947
805896,5,6304202377,"I was first inspired by Paddle to the Sea as a young lad in kindergarden.  To this day paddle fosters warm memories and reinforces philosophical images of life.  Think about it, paddle to the sea. . .",911260800,7,200,4.378378378378378

806047,5,6304202377,As an early '70's grade school kid I saw this movie several times and loved it (noisy projector with genuine reel-to-reel 16mm film!) What a pleasant surprise to find it on DVD!!! Thanks.,1422144000,,187,4.696969696969697
806048,5,6304202377,"Only one of the best movies of all time for kids that went to elementary school in the 80s.  I remember this movie as it was played on the original 16 mm film.  Also, the book is a great addition to this and is fun to read with your kids.  I recommend picking that up.",1417737600,2,268,3.8363636363636364
806049,4,6304202377,"I first read the book ""Paddle to the Sea"" as a small child of 7 (actually my mother read it to me).

806053,5,6304202377,"The entire collective reality of life in the universe is summarized in this epic film. After watching this, I probably do not need to watch anything else really. A true masterpiece.",1403049600,,181,4.870967741935484
806054,5,6304202377,"went to a school where we were forced to watch this movie, 20 years later I bought it for my sister as a present, its still the same movie.  What was priceless was making her and the whole family watch it together this Christmas.... A Holiday treat for the whole family",1390435200,,269,4.2745098039215685
806055,5,6304202377,I grew up watching this in school and it was a pleasurable trip. Cool to see an era where kids were allowed to card with a knife and smelt metal for weighing their crafts. A bygone era to be sure.,1389744000,,196,3.925
806156,5,6304202377,"I loved this movie as a child, and now my kids love it as well!  It is a great story of the journey of a boy's carved Indian in a canoe from Canada to the ocean.  My girls love watching this movie.",1388534400,,197,3.6666666666666665
806157,5,6304202377,"This continue to be a favorite.  My sons grew up with the book and the movie keeps true to it.  Beautiful scenery, simple story telling.  So nice to have something without all the cartoon animation!  I read the book, then shared the movie with students in my class.  It's now a favorite of theirs!",1386374400,,297,4.425925925925926
806158,5,6304202377,Enjoyed the simplicity of the narrative and creative film work to capture wildlife and human interaction in a realistic manner.,1381017600,,127,5.4
806159,4,6304202377,Paddle to The Sea is a good kids movie.  The little carved Indian travels through the Great Lakes on an adventure to the Sea.,1380672000,,125,4.208333333333333
806160,5,6304202377,"""Where did he come from? How did he get here? This little creature called Paddle to the Sea."" Those words begin one of the best films I've ever seen. This film makes me happy every time I view it.",1373500800,,196,4.051282051282051
806161,5,6304202377,"Outstanding film! Simplicity at its best, yet, had my grandkids ages 5 through 10 captivated with the journey.  Thought provoking for children and introduces a mild yet real moral delima for kids ;Should I put it back into the sea?; The film generated wonderful conversation throughout the film. Other must have childrens films: Portrait of Grandpa Doc, Little Fugitive; The Red Balloon; and White Mane. All about children, family and imagination... Enjoy!",1370390400,,456,5.333333333333333
806162,5,6304202377,I saw this movie when it first came on television.  It was a wonder how this little wooden canoe could make this long trip from the mountain to the ocean.  the carving of the canoe and Indian is very good.  To have some one with a dream that this little object to make it.  The idea of the carving on the bottom to make sure it gets all the way to the end.  This is a good movie to keep the children fascinated with the story to see it go.,1367971200,,439,3.8333333333333335
806163,4,6304202377,this  story on dvd paddle to the sea is from 1960's  there is a narrater through the story  as you view the dvd they capture the little wooden boat  as it travels along. it also shows  the passage of time like when the ice from the winter comes into play. safe for kids,1349481600,,269,4.0
806164,4,6304202377,"My wife would reminisce about the wonderful book PADDLE TO THE SEA that she remembers reading as a young girl growing up in Michigan. She thought the story of adventure and perseverance was one she wanted to share with our grandchildren. While this video is rather basic by today's cg standards, the essence of the book and story remain. While the 14 year old was kind of fidgety, the 12 and 10 year old were engrossed and appreciated seeing the book come to life. No movie can ever replicate the details in books and letting your imagination fill in the blanks. This video is the same in that there are many blanks. However, the heart of the story is there and if you first read the book, you should have an enjoyable experience.",1346112000,,730,4.496240601503759
806165,5,6304202377,"This is a wonderful movie, in the same league as The Red Balloon. Follow Paddle to the sea as he travels through the great lakes. Defying bears and fires, a child and Niagara Falls! This is a fun movie that young and old will love. It's nicely narrated and the visuals and great!",1325116800,,279,4.283018867924528
806246,5,6304202377,"Excellent film for adults and school kids.  Extremely well done, photography is perfect, and story keeps one interested and flows at a good pace.  I really enjoyed the film and so did my Native American church folk.",1317513600,,215,4.783783783783784
806247,4,6304202377,"I appreciate this vidio as it will give me something to show to my grandchildren.
It doesn't however follow the book by Holling Clancy Holling exactly and especially missing is the final episode where the indian boy now grown hears about his little boat making it all the way to France.  Otherwise the pictures were great and I am sure my grandchildren will love it.  Ol' Hegs",1301529600,,376,4.597014925373134
806248,5,6304202377,I purchased this short film for my great nephew.  He loved it just as much as I did!,1254700800,,84,3.6666666666666665
806249,2,6304202377,"My 6 yr. old son and I read this book and loved it. He is Inupiat Eskimo. I am from Michigan. We had a lot to talk about while reading the superb book - from following along the map to the different reactions of those that saw Paddle. In the book, people carve on the bottom wherever he stops so you can see right where he's been. He has really cool  and exciting adventures. This made it real. I thought the movie would be a no-brainer, it was nominated for an Oscar, right ? I know the movie was done in 1966, and I know all about ""artistic license"" and so forth, but...the movie SKIPPED the saw mill scene, the sled dog ride to the Sault, the trip to Chicago, virtually all of Lake Michigan...and had Paddle going from Superior to Detroit in five minutes or less and then out to sea! No wonder it didn't win an Oscar.  The only part we all liked was the first ten minutes - where the boy is carving and then places Paddle on the snowy hill...and then he goes downhill. Unfortunately, so does the movie. Literally and figuratively. Nothing more than a Reader's Digest condensed version. This DVD is going in the next yard sale. Even my 6 year old was visably ""bummed out"". Don't be thinking ""oh kids gotta have blood and guts these days"" like one reviewer wrote when she read other bad reviews - but they do need a STORY and the movie omitted the real story and instead made it out to be some sort of 60s evironmental ""message"", while ignoring the Native message which was in the original story. In the book, the news of Paddle making it to sea comes back to the boy, who is now older. He listens to white men take credit for putting it in the sea but it matters not to him because the knowledge that Paddle made it was enough. In the movie, by contrast, Paddle's journey never ends nor is there a tie back to the Native boy who made Paddle. Yuk. It was so bad it made me angry.",1240099200,26,1880,4.204986149584488
806250,5,6304202377,"I remember watching this film on the old reel to reel projectors 40 years ago in elementary school. Each year,as students, we all gathered in the school gym to watch this story. From my standpoint it seems like a simple classic short film from a simpler time when special effects and graphics were not the focus, but rather the story of the boy and his travels of his carved wooden boat. I would hope today's school children would accept this film as a classic and anticipate watching from year to year. ""Paddle to the Sea"" brings back a more innocent time when technolgy and ""all the hustle and bustle"" was not America's focal point. I really wish-and hope-that this film could be viewed by all of our elementary children!",1237334400,2,723,4.612403100775194
806251,5,6304202377,"It was a trip down memory lane to finally see and own this classic film that I remembered seeing as a young child.  The film left such an impact on me when I was yonger, opening my eyes to environmental awareness.  It was wonderful to finally be able to own a classic film (and classic story book) that I had only been briefly exposed to in the classroom so many years ago, but that left a such a lasting impression.",1231718400,2,416,4.1875
806252,4,6304202377,"Unfortunately the print is not as clean as what I've been used to seeing from a Criterion DVD, but it's highly enjoyable nonetheless.",1231718400,,133,4.826086956521739
806253,5,6304202377,"Growing up as a young boy in Michigan in 1960s, spending time on Lake Saint Clair/Lake Erie fishing for pike, muskee and perch with my father, watching the cargo freighters and hearing Indian stories fueled my love of nature and my curiosity about the world. It was the start of my wanderlust. ""Paddle to the Sea"" reminded me of that innocent time.

The story starts on a cold winter day, besides the warmth of a fireplace, a young Canadian boy is carving a wooden model of an Indian in a canoe out of a cedar log. He sets his toy boat free to travel through the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Seaway to the Atlantic ocean. We become part of that journey.",1229644800,2,648,4.4
806254,4,6304202377,"This is a classic short film I remember seeing in elementary school in the late 1970s. It presents the simple adventure story of a carved indian raft's journey to the sea with subtle (mostly) moral and environmental overtones. Kids will thoroughly enjoy this, especially if they're remotely into the outdoors.

My caveat is that the actual disc release is completely unexceptional. Image quality: claimed to be a newly restored high-definition master is sorely lacking. It exhibits poor image contrast and sharpness, with lots of inconsistent film grain and even some hairs occasionally clogging the frame. In 2008, correcting those sorts of technical flaws is something you can now easily do with a home computer. So I expected a lot more from the Criterion Collection.

Extras: none. I'd love to know a tiny bit more about the film and the filmmakers but there's nothing here other than the short and chapter stops. Love this movie, just wish it had gotten the first class treatment it deserves.",1224460800,3,997,5.036363636363636
806255,5,6304202377,"This little film is just really fun to watch.  I love the idea behind it, and teachers using it in the classroom will want to either read the book to their students first, or explain the premise, as the narration in the film is quite subtle regarding the boy's illness and why he himself cannot 'paddle to the sea.'  Very young kids will appreciate all the animals that interact with the canoe, and the film presents the opportunity to segue into science or history or geography lessons.",1218153600,6,487,4.586206896551724
806359,5,6304202377,"Having first met Paddle to the Sea in print as a child, and having been fascinated by it, I felt this was a true interpretation and faithful to the book. I would introduce the child first to the book and then to the DVD.",1217548800,5,220,4.0227272727272725
806360,5,6304202377,"This is the kind of film that works its way into your subconscious.  A boy carves a small wooden canoe with one wooden passenger...an all-watchful Native American...and sends the small craft into a frozen lake so that it can journey thousands of miles to the ocean. To keep the canoe afloat, the boy pours a bar of lead into the bottom of the canoe. ""I am Paddle to the Sea"" the boat tells us.  The film tracks its journey past frogs, deer, and snakes, past ice and storm, even past the rushing currents of Niagara Falls.  A few individuals fish it out of the water but on seeing the instructions (carved on the bottom of the boat) they wisely return the craft back into the lake or stream from whence it came.  Thus, the canoe returns to its mysterious source.  This is a fine contemplative film that makes us meditate on our own personal journeys, our own attachments, and our own connection to the living world  (After all, the canoe started out as part of a tree).  In a 21st century world where too many children's films are violent or meaningless, this is a perfect gift for youngsters five and upwards.",1214870400,11,1109,4.487562189054726
806361,5,6304202377,Great little story. Just as I remembered it from my childhood. Great DVD to share with your kids.,1214524800,,97,4.444444444444445
806362,4,6304202377,"This 1966 children's documentary from Canada -- concerning a child's toy canoe that slowly wends its way to the sea -- was shot in grainy 16mm with a mono soundtrack.  Most likely it will never look or sound better than it does in this spiffy new Janus Film/Criterion DVD.  Viewers who expect a Dolby stereo track on this disc will be disappointed; Criterion views unauthorized stereo remixes as a violation of authorial intent.

PADDLE TO THE SEA offers plenty of jaw-dropping nature footage that will leave you wondering just how director Bill Mason did it.  But the narration may be too pedantic and the pace too deliberate for today's youngsters.  No extras here, except for some well-written liner notes.",1212278400,6,709,4.92436974789916
806363,4,6304202377,"This beautiful little film is a miracle of photography and imagination.  I bought it for grandchildren and I hope they will enjoy it in years to come.  Criterian and Janus films seem to be promoting Paddle, The Red Baloon, and White Mane as children's films but I wonder how many will find the time in between the Shreks, Ants, Cars, and Incredibles, etc.  Nevertheless I congratulate Criterian for making these little gems available and recommend them highly.",1211241600,4,460,4.9480519480519485
806364,5,6304202377,"I grew up attending elementary school in Milan, Michigan in the early 1970s. Once a year, our class would pack into our tiny cafeteria to see a classic filmstrip: Paddle-to-the-Sea. This short film has been restored way better than I ever got to experience it back then. An excellent teaching primer, and just enjoyable to reminisce to. I've shared it with my daughter, who is now in first grade, and she really enjoyed it.",1210204800,7,423,4.72972972972973
806365,5,6304202377,"""Paddle to the Sea"" is the story of a carving of an Indian in a canoe that is placed in the snows of upper Lake Superior, and which has as its goal reaching the Atlantic ocean.  A legend written on the carving asks that anyone who finds him please put him back in the water.  His passage through lakes, locks, and rivers is depicted in scenes of great beauty alternating with scenes of industrialization and pollution.  Whether or not Paddle to the Sea will make it keeps arising as an issue, and the original beauty of the carving degrades as it traverses seemingly insurmountable barriers.  This is a movie that MOVES you... an emotional experience as gripping as any, done with simplicity and without dialogue.  It should not be missed.",1202774400,34,739,4.653846153846154
806366,4,6304202377,I remember being shown this movie back in the 70's when I was in about 6th grade. I always found it a magical story and I'm glad it's available on DVD. Every child of about 10-12 shouls see this movie.,1199491200,,201,4.05
806367,5,6304202377,"As an English teacher, I am so sorry to read the negative reviews of the two  young people.  I am in awe of Hollingsworth's ability to tell a good story for students. I own his books, albeit worn and well-read, and I am buying this film for my grandson, so I hope it is the one I saw when I was doing my PHD in children's literature in the early 1970.  I have never forgotten the story.  Perhaps our young people today are used to blood and guts, and fail to understand there is sweetness in life, too. I love Paddle to the Sea.",1006387200,70,528,4.048076923076923

7864497,5,6304202377,"I remembered this short film from nearly 50 years ago when my 4th grade teacher showed it in the classroom. Based on the classic children's book, I can see why it had been so memorable for so many years: simple, but powerful imagery, historical aspects, the film inspired empathy based on creativity, danger, humor, humanity, and hope. I was astounded by the actual footage of pollution being dumped into Lake Superior all those years ago! Surprisingy, my young grandsons were not as enthralled by the movie as I had hoped, at 5 and 7 years, they may be just a tad bit young yet.",1514592000,,579,4.576923076923077

The story of the boy and the topography and history of the Great Lakes captivated me starting a lifelong interest in that region. As an adult, I read it to all my kids. It is a family treasure.

Growing up around the Great Lakes in southern Ontario, Canada and spending much time vacationing in Northern Ontario around Lake Huron and later Lake Superior, this movie and the book absolutely fascinated me and piqued my interest in physical geography and the interrelationships of land and water where I lived. I now live in the dry US west in Utah but have a romantic and spiritual connection to the waters of the Great Lakes.
