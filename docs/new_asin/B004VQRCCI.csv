Wonderful/artistic cinematography including of aging, dying, and death. Exceptional performances by Paul Giamatti, Rosamund Pike and the many supporting actors including Minnie Driver doing a fantastic job as an overbearing wife and Dustin Hoffman as the doting father (awesome!). If you like Paul Giamatti, you will love this film.

4483816,1,B004VQRCCI,"This film was very slow, remarkably depressing, and didn't have a point as far as I can tell. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.",1309305600,7,135,4.44
4483817,5,B004VQRCCI,"""Is she the one, is she the mother of your children?""  After receiving a book about him Barney (Giamatti) begins to reflect on his life.  Set between when he was young and got married to his first wife and present day we are treated to ""Barney's Version"" of his life.  This is a movie I can just not say enough about.  The best movie of the year, and one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is impossible to talk about this movie without giving away the ending so I have a hard review to write.  When you do see this movie please make sure you don't give away the ending, so that others may experience it the way you did.  The one big problem I have with this movie is that not only was this movie totally snubbed by the ""Oscars"" with a total of 0 nominations, but that Paul Giammati won the ""Golden Globe"" for best actor in a comedy!!!  Anyone who watches this will tell you that this is about as much of a comedy as ""Schindler's List"".  Giammati gives one of the best performances I have ever seen and to not get noticed by the ""Oscars"" and told that it was comedic is a slap in the face.  I will spare you my usual rant on how the best movies don't get seen because of no use of CGI, but this is another one of them.  Watch this movie, tell everyone you know to watch this movie.  Incredible, incredible film.  Overall, best picture of the year, and top ten of all time.  I give it an A+.

Would I watch again? - Absolutely, I will tell as many people to watch this as I can.

4483818,5,B004VQRCCI,"I have been hearing the grumblings from customers that this title is not obtainable unless you buy the entire package (BD/DVD), but I have to admit for the quality of movie and entire package - it is a worthy purchase; it is good enough that I feel you can share the disc you don't want with friends as a recommendation.

Barney's Version follows thirty years of a man's life as he traverses through three marriages and a questionable quality of life at the end of his journey. The performances, writing and locations are all worthy to watch, and even though this is a low impact film, the needed picture clarity and sound yearned to be preserved in Blu. The colors and lens tints in all of the locations shine, especially the Roman streets and New York/Montreal countryside. The DTS sound had only a few surround moments, but the dialogue volume is done well. The supplements include:

* Making of, 10:23 minutes. In lodef, very clip heavy, and is almost the least helpful of the supplements.
* Mordecai Richler Interview, 3:18 minutes. I suppose big fans of his will have already seen this from a few years back, but a worthy addition to the film here. He talks while shooting pool and reads from his book.
* Red carpet, 4:15 minutes. Standard interviews from the carpet at the AFI Fest. Always nice to see everyone all dressed up and sincerely enjoying their art.
* 92nd St Q&A, 35:09 minutes. Big fans of Giamatti will love this one as he gets interviewed in length about a great deal of topics. He does well and provides some honest input (always with a little self loathe and candor).
* Crew commentary, honestly I got more from the interviews.
* Disc 2 is the DVD version of the film.

Region coded A, with audio and subs in English only. The ratio says 2.35:1 but I did not check to see what the DVD is (as nothing is even listed on the outside case/on the disc for that part of the product). It has played very well in the store as Giamatti has a big following and the R rating is not too gratuitous so even the older teens appear to have gotten something out of it. Even though there are gripes out there about pacing, the non-lineal effect pays off and the award nods for acting and make-up were well deserved.",1308960000,2,2221,4.4655172413793105
4483819,3,B004VQRCCI,"Giamatti plays his usual exasperated and morose self in this movie.  Oh man, it's nearly painful watching him dump his beautiful, wealthy, just-married wife over some girl he falls in ""love-at-first-sight"" with at his wedding.  But that turns out to be a good thing later on, as these things will in Hollywood land.  Hoffman, as his father, brings a nice balancing element - he's as bright and effervescent as Barney is gloomy and self-absorbed.  Alright, the movie winds up kind of unexpectedly.. I'm not sure what it said exactly.. I guess it was kind of touching. Overall I found it a bit on the slow side, not terribly slow, it was half-interesting, but had nothing of the fun genius of movie like ""Sideways"".  That was because of Giamatti's co-star in that movie - the contrast of the two characters was what made it great. Perhaps its unfair to compare the two movies, being of slightly different genres.  Suffice to say, if you're in the mood for a few weepy moments, and if you enjoy Giamatti's typical character, Barney's Version is worth a watch.  I'd rent before buying though.",1308787200,4,1088,4.75531914893617
4483820,5,B004VQRCCI,"I just loved this movie. My heart really went out to Barney Panofsky, the Paul Giamatti character. He seems like a creepy TV executive who may have murdered his wife at first, but the more you see of it the more sympathetic his much maligned character becomes. An ex-cop with an axe to grind has written a hatefilled biography of him, full of lies. But this is ""Barney's Version"" of his life.

I think this is Gaimatti's most involving role since his classic ""Sideways"", a similar rascal character. The amazing thing here is makeup for which the movie was nominated for an Academy Award! It is easy to make an young guy old, but practically impossible to make an older guy look young and that's what the makeup people do here, in the beginning Barney is maybe in his twenties and Giamatti, I'm guessing, is in his forties! In the beginning he is a bohemian in Italy, living with his hippie, druggy buddies. His girlfriend (Rachelle Lefevre) is pregnant and convinces him he is the dad and he should marry her. Despite her ambiguous morality, he does the ""right thing"", only to find her love child is black and he's been tricked. Then the girl dies in childbirth!

He marries again but at his wedding, he meets the love of his life, Miriam, played by the beautiful and luminous Rosamund Pike. And she isn't the woman he is marrying, (Minnie Driver)(!) I won't tell more. All this happens early in the movie. The movie takes Giammatti from his twenties to his sixties, maybe. Amazing makeup, as I've said.

Sad, funny, heartrending. A little known, but heartfelt movie, wonderful acting and much more interesting than Gaimatti's more famous ""Win/Win"". Based on the last novel by Mordecai Richler.

Highly Recommended.

""Barneys' Version"" should have been a nominee for ""Best Actor"", and would have been any other year except this one, 2010, with so many other great performances!",1305504000,4,1877,4.763076923076923
4483821,5,B004VQRCCI,"I initially saw ""Barney's Version,"" having never heard of it, at its New York premiere, expecting Dustin Hoffman to be there. He wasn't, but, that night, I experienced something I never had before (I'm 60). Yes, I had never cried so much from a film after laughing so much from the same film. Paul Giamatti wuz robbed, as he shoulda won the Oscar. Sure, Colin Firth was excellent, but Paul's acting was on a level that we experience perhaps once in a decade. Dustin is as terrific as he was in ""Midnight Cowboy"" & ""Rain Man""--only subtler. Rosamund Pike, wearing auburn wigs throughout the film, is wonderful--a former Bond girl and Oxford graduate from England (in real life) as the most desirable woman one could ever imagine--brains, beauty, body, & wit to boot--the very essence of tranquility. I think that, for example, Jack Nicholson, Bette Davis, and Katharine Hepburn is/were great. However, there is/was always a bit of Jack, Bette & Kate in all their films and in real life. Rosamund transcends that trio, because she has created, with amazing intensity and with an American accent, someone who could never exist, except in our hearts and minds. And in every one of her scenes, it is virtually impossible to look at anyone else. There is a scene, immediately after the protagonist's second wedding, that I found to be the most exciting of my life. Too bad I can't give it away. Well, I can, but that wouldn't be nice. Minnie Driver, as wife # 2 (of 3), is simply marvelous--acting at its peak. Many supporting players are superb as well. I'll single out Harvey Atkin, as Barney's second father-in-law, Thomas Trabacchi, as Barney's close friend from Italy, and Scott Speedman, as Barney's heroin & cocaine-using & opium & hashish-smoking best friend. This film is Barney's version of what occurred in order to refute a retired detective's memoir that accused Barney of murder. But the possible murder is far from the focal point of the film. Much more important is Barney's romance with the love of his life. Luckily, we get to observe, mostly through flashbacks, the final 36 years of his amazing life (beginning at age 30) and the ending ranks as one of the greatest ever--right up there with that of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" By the way, I've read the novel & the screenplay, but I prefer the finished product of the film most of all. As of October 30, 2011, I've seen it 31 times, but I'm sure that number will change.",1299628800,57,2432,4.724705882352941

After marrying his wife he falls in love with another woman at his wedding. He pursues her for years, and they end up together. This film is really engrossing. The lead character is easy to relate to, and I found myself rooting for him throughout. It seems a little long at times, and his relentless pursuit of the woman he loves is basically stalking, but the movie's strong performances and likeable characters make it an intriguing film to watch.",1298246400,6,592,4.647619047619048
4483823,4,B004VQRCCI,"Barney's Version is the film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Canadian author Mordecai Richler.

Barney's Version is at its heart the life of Barney Panofsky, a Jewish man from Montreal who seems at once blessed by fate with opportunities but cursed by flaws that ultimately undo him. Irascible and impulsive, he has a charm that endears even as his behavior often appalls. He has the gift of recognizing the spark of creative genius in others but is seemingly incapable of producing it himself, spending most of his adult life as a producer of a long-running (and painfully banal) Canadian TV soap opera - Constable O'Malley of the North - through his company, the sardonically-named Totally Unnecessary Productions.

The film begins with Barney, on the eve of celebrating his soap opera's 30th year of production, having to contend with the publication of a book by an ex-cop purporting to reveal how Barney is guilty of murder. What follows is Barney's Version of the events of his life, starting with his semi-hedonistic hanging about with friends in Europe when he was in his 20's, quickly careening through two disastrous marriages until he meets the one true love of his life, Miriam, who's a guest at his second wedding.

As a film, Barney's Version suffers from the choices made for the adaptation by the scriptwriter Michael Konyves, both in terms of the framing, which reduces the overall impact that came across in the novel, and in the reductions and compressions which make some of the characters come across as two-dimensional and others at times baffling in terms of their actions and decisions.

But all that said, it is still a movie well worth seeing for the great cast that manage for the most part to overcome the shortcomings of the script and for particularly fine performances by Paul Giamatti as Barney; Rosamund Pike as his third ex-wife (and only real love), Miriam; Dustin Hoffman as his loving but embarrassingly coarse father, Izzy; and Scott Speedman as his friend Boogie, a gifted but spectacularly self-destructive writer whom Barney is suspected of murdering.

It is worth noting that for his performance in Barney's Version, Giamatti won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical. His performance is truly what makes the film work as he manages to bring out all of the qualities that make Barney at once sympathetic - his impulsiveness, his capacity for grand gestures, his ability to love - and yet annoyingly pathetic - his passive-aggressiveness, his insecurities, and his inability to realize when he's screwing up. Giamatti seems to slip effortlessly from one to the other, putting Barney Panofsky with all of his human gifts and frailties on full display.  And the film itself was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup as it had to show Giamatti as Barney aging from his 20's through his 60's.  It's subtle but well-done, making you feel that you're really seeing his life as it happened.

On a side-note, Canadian film buffs may spot cameos by a number of Canadian directors: Atom Egoyan (as an early director of Barney's soap opera), David Cronenberg (as a later director of the soap), Paul Gross (as a star in the soap), and Denys Arcand (as the Matre'D at Barney & Miriam's last luncheon). And if you notice a surprisingly strong resemblance between Barney's father, Izzy, and his son, Michael (as an adult), it's because Michael is played by Jake Hoffman, who is Dustin Hoffman's real-life son.  And Barney's daughter as a young girl is played by Simone Richler.

Definitely recommended as an entertaining and engaging film.",1297814400,22,3609,4.921052631578948
4483824,4,B004VQRCCI,"Paul Giamatti has made a career of playing reprobates who are lovable largely because he plays them. In ""Sideways,"" Giamatti played a man who steals money from his mother to finance a weekend getaway; in Richard J. Lewis' ""Barney's Version,"" based on Mordecai Richler's last novel, Giamatti plays a man who deserts his new bride at their wedding to chase a woman he just met.

""Barney's Version"" gives us the panorama of the life of Barney Panofsky (Giamatti), a Montreal soap opera producer, as he careens through three marriages (to Rachelle Lefevre, Minnie Driver, and Rosamund Pike, in that order) and countless other scrapes including a murder rap. Barney is a thoroughgoing rogue--when we first meet, he's crank-calling his ex-wife's new husband at 3 a.m.--but Giamatti gives him an impish twinkle, a bold love of life and a tinge of melancholy that make you want to hug him despite yourself.

""Barney's Version"" is obviously a movie made from a novel; it has a firm structure but feels flabby and uncinematic in places. Nevertheless, Giamatti--who won a deserved Golden Globe for his performance and was robbed of an Oscar nomination--will keep you watching happily all the way to the film's poignant end. The other performances are excellent too, including all of Barney's aforementioned wives and also Dustin Hoffman as Barney's low-life cop father, Bruce Greenwood as a pompous radio producer and Scott Speedman as the freeloading, failed-writer buddy Barney may or may not have killed. (Fans of Canadian film will enjoy seeing a roll call of famous Canadian directors in cameo roles, including Atom Egoyan, Ted Kotcheff, Denys Arcand and--goofing on his ""Due South"" persona--Paul Gross.)  Featuring gorgeous photography of Rome and the Quebec countryside, ""Barney's Version"" is a fine tragicomic romp.",1297296000,7,1812,5.219931271477663

How does everyman land beautiful wives like Minnie Driver and Rosamund Pike?  Let's hope it's more than fantasy.

4483839,5,B004VQRCCI,"Barney's Version film is one of the few to be a life-touching films and somewhat of a self-development film to young men through its devotion to pursuing the woman you hold close to heart. In addition, teaches men to treat the woman that you love dearly as your treasure. There were sad moments in the film that seem to teach more of a lesson on the woman you choose, the friends you allow into your home (giving the life-lesson that some would try fornication), and their was much to smile and laugh about in the film. I personally don't understand why this film wasn't as popular as it should have been. Honestly, I love this film, for its like a voice to men in a agape sense! Language was explicit as a demonstration to a life unfiltered (meaning their is filthy language that people like to construct). Paul Giamatti chose a great film to be the main actor and the acting was superb. I won't lie and say it was full of drama because certain parts of the film you'll laugh and certain parts you'll gain wisdom, and certain parts you'll feel sad and disappointed things turned out that way but in a mesmerizing type of sense. Personally thought his second wife was a decent wife (Minnie Driver) whom made efforts but her sexual drive became suppressed because of Barney not giving daily sex so she cheated. But the Third wife was a very good choice but Barney cheated because of sexual suppression when Miriam Grant-Panofsky (third wife) left on vocation with the company of their son and Blair (who was courting his wife in secret), there was Karma in this!

In my opinion realistic conversations and reactions plus you get to consider some what ifs and what maybe the actors should have done different in the decisions they made regarding the plot.

4483853,2,B004VQRCCI,"So once again, Paul Giametti plays an unlovable loser whom beautiful women inexplicably fall in love with--and this time, he's reverse-aged in bizarre ways and has an accent that sometimes veers towards the Canadian, sometimes towards the Bronx.  After he ignores the pleas and orders of Miriam to just leave her alone--in other words, he stalks her--she spends part of a day with him and is ready to start bearing his children.  Why?  I have no idea; Barney lacks charm, attractiveness, wit, but he does have persistence, I guess--and it fits the plot to have Miriam fall in love with him.  Really, do we need another movie in which a self-centered, unlikable man receives the love of a good woman and then deeply hurts her--and he's the hero? (Anti-hero, I know, but still,  it's his story that's meant to keep our attention.)

And what is the story here? The murder mystery?  That only fitfully captures the film's interest, and its resolution happens so fast that one might miss it.  Barney's story?  Of what?  He's not bad enough to be truly interesting, and the movie vilifies so many of the women around him that he's often made out to be the victim of the harpies he's (for some reason) married.  The plot is just a series of events that happen because the writers want them to happen, not because we believe these characters would do any of these things.  Why did Barney's first wife marry him?  No idea.  Why did he marry his second wife?  Again, no idea.  And why did Barney's life end the way it did?  No idea--except perhaps to elicit some pathos, some sympathy, for this banal, nasty little man.

There are two small glimmers of light in this train wreck:  Dustin Hoffman as Izzy fully embodies his character; he's over the top and so situationally unaware as to be unrealistic (Rain Man joins the police force!), but he was a person with motivation and some depth.  And while I didn't believe for a minute that beautiful, intelligent Miriam would marry the schlub who stalked her, I thought her character brought some maturity and insight to their relationship.  When she finally left, all I could feel was relief for her.

I like movies with dark humor and complicated, flawed characters.  But this movie had no narrative or thematic coherence; it was  a collection of tics and flaws and things that happen.  And a long damned 2 hours and 15 minutes.",1408233600,3,2366,4.684466019417476
4483854,4,B004VQRCCI,"Barney Panofsky (played by Paul Giamatti) lead a wild and hedonistic life style during his youth when living in Rome and collected an electic assortment of friends, and one short-lived wife. He was later swept off his feet by his second wife, played perfectly by Minnie Driver, but it soon became apparent that she wasn't the love of his life. During a weekend away at the family cabin in the woods, his best friend died in a suspicious accident, and the local constable was convinced that Barney murdered him, though there was no body and insufficient evidence to pursue a case. The wild life, 2 wives, and murder are depicted in the previews, but if you selected the movie based on the previews alone, you would be quite surprised at the way the plot developed, as I was.

Barney met his third wife, Miriam (played by the lovely Rosamund Pike) when she was a guest at his wedding to Minnie Driver. It was love at first sight, and he was infatuated with her, but she wouldn't have anything to do with him while he was married. When the second marriage ended, he was free to court her, and they married and lived happily ever after ---- well not quite, but they had a long and very happy marriage. The movie is ultimately about love and commitment and the true connection between these two characters. There are many poignant moments, both happy and sad.

Casting in Barney's Version was excellent - no one plays the misguided, slightly narcissistic schlub quite like Giamatti. His father was played charmingly by Dustin Hoffman, and I just can't say enough about Rosamund Pike. She played Miriam so beautifully - lovely, witty, charming, no-nonsense, and intelligent. She was too good for Barney, and he probably knew it - but she was the love of his life until the end.",1408233600,,1771,4.654952076677317

This was probably one of the worst movies ever to take up my very valuable time, and I wish I had never bought it.  I cannot understand why other reviewers loved it, or how it won so many awards.

The story starts in Italy with young Barneys very brief marriage (more like an escapade) to a woman who soon kills herself.  From there, once back in the States, he owns a small movie production company (soft porn, it would appear), and sets his sights on the well-endowed, well-bred, well-educated woman he marries for only those reasons.

He has no deep love for his wife, only for Miriam Grant, a guest he meets AT THEIR WEDDING!  Can you imagine?  He eventually divorces, then pursues and marries Miriam  but he cheats and loses her.

Was the story entertaining, enlightening, heartwarming, amusing, or uplifting?  Have I been enriched by watching it?  Definitely not!  Its just the story of a man who is motivated by nothing more meaningful in life than his own lust and self-interests.  Barney reaches an end befitting his transgressions -- totally demented, unable to even figure out how to use a fork.

With an array of highly acclaimed actors, performances  were indeed high-quality, but the story itself was a dismal disappointment.  My copy will be donated to a local thrift store; it certainly won't remain in my home collection.",1399852800,2,1392,4.785714285714286

I don't want to give away too much but I can say that it is a man's version of how he sees life. Very existential. I use that word alot in my reviews but this movie really follows that philosophy.

Despite society's taboos, Barney 's life spins out of control from smoking and drinking while he gets and marries his ideal princess, Miriam, while recently being married. He should have gotten an annulment from his second wife. While pursuing Miriam she has flaws, playing moral lecturing cat and mouse, ie taking his obsessive calls from a married man, and not pursuing other men. After a decade of marital bliss, Miriam explains to Barney, that she is going back to work as a TV host.  He gives his machissimo control freak speech, that he is the bread winner. He, out of vicious neglect, failed to attend her first TV interviews, watching hockey games habitually at a pub and getting drunk. He did the same abandonment trick at his second wedding. After some snide jealous remark over a colleague's sexuality, Miriam leaves him for space, taking her son along. After Barney has a one night stand despite his begging for forgiveness, she moves in with  her work colleague waiting in the wings.  Princesses don't tolerate mistakes. His main concern after the cheating mistake was if he caught an STD and was devastated by Miriam's final total rejection. There is no slap or profanity as his 3rd wife called him an animal in the end because Miriam is too fragile incapable of expressing emotion and she is a princess. As for relationships, it reminds me of Annie Hall.",1377648000,,1391,4.811715481171548

Oh, Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, with his plump, appealing, roly-poly demeanor.  But scene after scene of him pouring himself another glass of liquor or puffing on a cigar or arguing with someone in a superficial manner as he bounces from marriage to marriage doesn't add up to much of a character portrait.  He seems to find the true love of his life in wife No. 3 -- Miriam.  And lovely she is.  Although how one could so blithely kick the appealing Minnie Driver out of bed seems unlikely at best.  But even the marriage to Miriam doesn't quite catch fire.  All of the actors are good, including a likable Dustin Hoffman as Barney's retired cop father.  But the screenplay is dramatically thin, despite much blustering, lacking in character depth.  None of Barney's relationships come across as anything more than superficial.  Or maybe I'm missing the point of the film, but do you really want to come away from a movie feeling nothing more than ambivalence toward its characters?",1369612800,3,1282,4.8657407407407405

4483868,5,B004VQRCCI,"There's an old axiom that seldom are individuals all good or all bad.  But if people are generally a little of both, how do we know if they are one or the other?  Mordecai Richler introduces us to a protagonist with a big heart as well as equally big warts and poses this question: Is he a good man or not?  Though most people have good intentions, we don't live with people deep down in their souls where their good intentions lie.  We live with them in the real world, with the choices they make, and the consequences of those choices--generally approaching another's character by way of his choices and actions.  Barney's Version is, foremost, a beautiful piece of art but also a film that presents us with a dilemma to just that approach.  In the first instance, it's a gorgeous film--visually sumptuous, luminous characters, rich in story and emotional authenticity, and laden with golden performances, especially from Giamatti, who's established himself as a dean of American performing arts.  No explosions, no hardware, no ILM special effects--just a movie so sensuously textured you feel as though it reaches out from the screen and wraps you in a sheet of silk.  In the second instance, we see people suffer the choices Barney Panofsky makes.  But Barney is far too multi-dimensional for us, or the people in his life, to write off his moral character so easily.  The elements of his story--the vicissitudes of an ordinary man's life; his delicate relationships with wife, father, and friends; his pleasures and pains; his desires and dreads--might have come to be seen as too ordinary, too unremarkable.  The triumph of this film is that if deftly assembles all the components of remarkable cinema to compel us to see the extraordinary in an ordinary man's--even a flawed man's--life.  And it is with this imperfect and complex individual that Richler and Konyves put forth their question and partially answer it.  Sometimes--and it's not quite clear when--the character of someone with seemingly insurmountable personal defects can't be completely defined by the sum total of his bad choices.  It's not a finite answer, and each viewer is left to reach his own conclusion.  But in presenting us with that challenge and this wonder-filled story, Barney's Version is masterful and, like all great art, rises well above the question it originally poses.",1360281600,8,2362,4.989795918367347

While most men would get over it and move on, Barney does not. The inanity of the situation is what makes the story mildly humorous, but lacks full comedy credentials.

Spoiler synopsis. Don't read until after you've seen the movie.

Who shall say I am not the happy genius of my household?  William Carlos Williams

Barney's life trajectory is seen in flashbacks from 1974 to 2010, from Rome to Montreal, his three marriages, to a painter, to a religious socioeconomic match, then love which just happens. Barney is a mensch (Yiddish for an ethical kindly gentle good hearted man) a rescuer of family, friends, writers, artists, a loyal, supportive, encouraging enabler.

Barney's caregiving and protection begin with his widowed policeman father Izzy Israel Panofsky (Dustin Hoffman): Don't ever tell my father what he will or will not do. He's my father and he will have your respect.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emotional-Intelligence-10th-Anniversary-Edition-Why-It-Can-Matter-More-Than-IQ/dp/055380491X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emotional Intelligence: 10th Anniversary Edition; Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</a>&nbsp;Barney's intuition for human suffering and pain guides his choices imperfectly but compassionately; nonjudging caretaking of others matched with denial of how his behavior harms.

Barney is the sole buyer of painter Leo Fasoli's works in Rome 1974. Bernard ""Boogie"" is a gifted novelist. Boogie likens Barney to philosopher Heine (Thought precedes action as lightening precedes thunder 1834 compare with DVD Iron Lady: thought becomes action, actions become habits, habits become character, character is destiny. Our thoughts are our destiny). Barney practices tikkun olam (Hebrew repairing the world) persistent in trying to control others, make things better, borrowing money to support insolvent Boogie. Friendship means caretaking without autonomy to Barney without requiring accountability or responsibility in return.

Painter Clara cuckholds Barney with best friends Boogie and Anonymous (unimportant characters lack names). Barney's attempt to rescue Clara from artistic emotional instability is thwarted by adultery, a stillborn infant, Boogie's alcoholic forgetfulness heralding incipient dementia. [Last weekend we participated in an eight stage Survivor competition between 18 year olds and parent teams, which affirmed that we live unaware of declining mental dexterity (Trivia competition) never even heard of TV shows or bands]

Clara's father's insensitivity to psychiatrist's molestation of Clara and her suicide attempt at age 12 offends Barney, even though Clara spits grief as aggression: you wear your heart on your sleeve, put it away, it is disgusting.

Barney moves to Montreal to produce TV soap opera with his uncle, hiring Bulgarian Solange. Fake tabloids faxed from Bulgaria support Solange's self image as sex symbol TV star. Barney intuits other's needs and supports cherished denial and fantasies.

At Barney's wedding to his second nameless wife (Minnie Driver), he is entranced by guest Miriam. Miriam is intelligent, curious, reads, is abreast of current events, and cares enough about other people to be interested in what interests them. Miriam sustains dignity and integrity in the face of Barney's adulterous pursuit: sobriety and regret await you.

Izzy's wedding present of his first gun becomes an unexpected liability when Boogie disappears in 1980.

Firefighting plane hum ties the entire movie together. Ominous whirring brackets Barney's lifeline from 1980 when Boogie disappears to 2010 when 66 year old Barney watches a child swimming with an inflated ball explaining Boogie's skeletal ""skydiving"" fractures.

Barney's divorce, then marriage to Miriam is a lovely second act with children Michael and Kate granting him a blessed contented life. Izzy: you did good boychick. Izzy's death ends loving mutual support and encouragement between father and son as Barney drifts between drinking and sports, neglecting Miriam.

The honesty in Barney and Miriam's marriage is admirable for dignified communication: I just wanted to be clear what happened here. The one unacceptable for Miriam whose own mother died of cancer and a broken heart from her father's indiscretions is adultery.

4483879,4,B004VQRCCI,"Paul Giamatti gives another powerful performance as Barney Panofsky, a Jewish Canadian TV producer.  Slipping into dementia he reflects back on his life, primarily by referencing his failed 3 marriages.  We get to go along for the ride.  Living in Italy as a young man in 1974, he hangs with a small cadre of friends including Clara (Rachelle Lefevre).  When she becomes pregnant, Barney believing the child was his agrees to marry her.  The baby is stillborn but isn't his, so Barney understandably bolts but with tragic consequences.

His second wife is the stereotypical Jewish princess played by Minnie Driver.  Her family is wealthy, but she is every bit as annoying to Barney as she is to us.  But then so is Barney.  He wants a divorce and finds his opportunity when he catches his wife banging his best friend, Boogie (Scott Speedman).  In a subplot, Boogie disappears after falling into a lake after he and Barney get drunk (a common theme throughout) and argue over the fidelity issue.  The police believe Barney killed Boogie but have no evidence or body.

Back to the wives.  On Barney's wedding night with wife number 2, he meets future wife number 3, Miriam (Rosamund Pike).  She is surprised by Barney's interest in her, dismissing his actions, yet secretly appreciates his determination.  After his divorce is final with number 2, his vigilance is finally rewarded.  Giamatti's performance is justifiably acknowledged but Rosamund Pike has been overlooked for years.  Her take on the beautiful, smart and charming 3rd Mrs. Panofsky equals her co-star.  Both age over 30 years in the film and I must say that for a small production, it is really well done.

Dustin Hoffman has a nice turn as well as Barney's dad, an ex-cop.  The film isn't without flaws however.  While Barney finally has happiness with Miriam and raises 2 children to adulthood, you have to question the attraction she ever had.  Barney is not likeable.  He's loud and obnoxious and a social pariah.  Miriam is just the opposite, and well...just look at the two of them.  The film also pushes the boundaries just being excessive.  The conclusion, while contextually important, goes on too long.  Still this is a very good film directed by Richard J. Lewis.  The Blu ray disc looks great.

4483889,4,B004VQRCCI,"Sounding not unlike a child's software program - ""Barney's Version"" is a terrible name for a film and nearly put me off renting this 'journey' movie - I'm glad it didn't.

Produced by Robert Lantos and Directed by Richard Lewis, the screenplay by Michael Konyves is adapted from Mordecai Richler's 1997 book of the same name. Across 30 eventful years, it tells the story of Barney Panofsky - a Monte Cristo smoking, whiskey guzzling chubby man living in Montreal. Barney is the TV Producing equivalent of ""Gregory House"" - irascible and loveable at the same time. Like his Dad Izzy Panofsky (a scene-stealing Dustin Hoffman) Barney tells it as it is - loves women impulsively - is headstrong in everything he does but has his heart in the right place. But he has a fatal flaw. It isn't that Barney is deliberately cruel or mean, he just keeps on making terrible mistakes over and over again (most of which are of his own making) and learns rather painfully as the years pass and happiness fades that the enemy is not others but 'himself'.

It begins in Rome in 1974 when we're introduced to his motley crew of dead-beat friends - there's Thomas Trabacchi as Leo Fasoli - an Italian artistic genius who has yet to find an appreciative audience, a black friend who does a terrible deed on Barney (he later forgives this) and his best-friend - Boogie. Young, cocky, handsome and fancy-free - Boogie is a full-on babe magnet (played beautifully by Scott Speedman) who can't seem to finish his brilliant first novel as he systematically hoovers up every narcotic he can get his sweaty hands on. You sense Barney admires his balls and vicariously lives out his fantasies through Bookie's wanton bohemian lifestyle - but as life and the years go on - Bookie's drug addiction and stupid waste of a God-given talent stop being funny and even lead to a drunken catastrophe by a lake house.

We are then introducing to Barney's three women - Clara, Bonnie and Miriam. Each of the actresses get real meat to work with and you can really sense they are relishing good parts in a good film. 1st up is Rachelle LeFevre playing Clara Chambers - a family dysfunctional who is beautiful but bordering on mental illness at every moment. Her performance is short but so astutely done. Barney then meets the equally gorgeous Miriam - a well-connected Jewish lady who can talk to beat the band (has a `Master's Degree') - dryly played by Minnie Driver to maximum effect. But then his eyes meet with the real deal - Miriam - played by the ethereally beautiful British actress Rosamund Pike. Barney is lost from the moment he sees her and pursues Miriam with the relentlessness of a Tomahawk missile. Their relationship's up and downs make up the bulk of the movie and Pike is fabulous in the part. More top moments are provided by the rest of the cast...

Hoffman gets some great dialogue which he delivers in that soft understated way of his - regaling a table of elderly po-faced ladies at Barney's 2nd wedding about his 'cop-on-the-beat' past he tells them ""...he came at me with a hard-on the size of a can of hairspray..."" Or when he's giving his son ludicrously inept parental advice about his feelingless marriage to Bonnie ""...you're married to a well-bred woman who is loaded, makes a nice Flaky Kugel and has a beautiful rack - many successful marriages have been built on far less...""

Nice supporting roles also go Kate Hopkins and Jake Hoffman who play Kate and Michael (Miriam and Barney's grown-up children) - Jake Hoffman showing more than a passing vocal and visual resemblance to his famous Dad - and glimpses of his acting chops. Bruce Greenwood is Blair - a handsome vegan who tempts Miriam both mentally and spiritually in the later stages of her rocky marriage to Barney - while Macha Grenon is superb as Solange - an aging TV star in the 30th season of Barney's daytime soap ""Malley Of The North"" - a woman who constantly harks back to her looks in the past (her clinging neediness is both protected and derided by Barney in equal measure). England's Mark Addy is excellent as Detective Sean O'Hearne - a bull-headed cop who is convinced that Barney has literally gotten away with murdering one his friends and has published a book to that effect called ""With Friends Like These"" (the mystery is brilliantly resolved at the end of the movie). There's even a great cameo by Saul Rubinek as Clara's Jewish father who tries to guilt away Clara's self-destructive past - but not in a way that shows compassion - but embarrassment for what it brought to their family (Barney makes short shift of him).

But the film belongs to Giamatti - who gives his bumbling motormouth of a creation a beating heart - you laugh at Barney's life-grabbing impulsiveness (a particularly nice scene where he chases after Miriam in a train) up to his heart-breaking remorse at doing what he said he would never do to Miriam (crying into her chest on the side of the bed). With the aid of wigs and make-up, Giamatti flits from one time period to the next - and in each his character is wholly believable. In rolls on to 2010 where Barney is now balding and forgetting where he parked his car - but gets one final meet with his beloved Miriam. They talk openly and honestly and despite differences and irreparable harm - express their true feelings (title above). Paul Giamatti is magnificent in the role and fully deserved of his Golden Globes Award for Best Actor.

To sum up - while it's a couple of shades short of being a masterpiece - ""Barney's Version"" is that rarity - a really good film that you've neither seen nor heard of - a little filmic gem that deserves a viewing and will reward you for doing so.

4483893,1,B004VQRCCI,"There is no question that the actors all offered superb and nuanced performances. Great!

However, even on the surface, this is a story about the life of a flawed and damaged individual, and ends with him dying of a terrible disease. In common parlance, the story is a ""downer"" with no real redeeming social value in terms of moral education, wholesome entertainment, or artistry. Not great!

What I found most disturbing is the story at a deeper level. Here was a very decent guy with a couple of bad habits who was ""taken apart"" by: (1) a self-destructive first wife; (2) his uncontrollable, mis-timed passion for the woman who eventually became his third wife; (3) his third wife's decision to punish him by leaving for a week; and (4) his weakness during a chance encounter under worst-case circumstances during that week. Then he dies... slowly and tragically. REALLY NOT GREAT!

This is VERY similar to everyman's life in the Baby-Boom generation (including my own)... perhaps everyman's life in the history of the world. No forgiveness when it is needed most, and no Divine Grace when it could have done the most good. This wasn't tragedy, and it wasn't artistry in any elevating sense of the word.

4483894,5,B004VQRCCI,"If I could recommend one film, it would be ""Barney's Version'. A film that creeps up on you- at first laughing and then silently weeping. A marvel of a film with much to say, one of those films you think about long afterr the viewing.

'Barney's Version' tells the story of a man not particularly talented or good looking or very rich, but a man who is greatly loved by a beautiful woman and that is a puzzle to many. Barney drinks much too much, smokes cigars, has a paunch, isn't there when she really needs him, but he has something that is palpable. Paul Giamatti plays Barney, and this is a wonder of his acting. He has picked roles of men who are not particularly distinguised, but he makes these men something to behold. Barney was married three times, once to a young woman who killed herself, the second time because the woman loved him, and on his wedding day he met the love of his life and pursued her until they were married. Two children and a wonderful life and then it falls apart. Barney never recovers, and as he ponders his life in flashbacks, we come to understand where he has been but not where he is going. Many lessons in this film, and it is sad that Barney never really gets to understand these lessons.

Paul Giamatti's performance is remarkable, a performance that deserved the Oscar. The nuance of his acting is so beautiful. He reminded me of a friend.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-12-11

4483895,4,B004VQRCCI,"Barney's Version is one of my favorite books.  The movie/DVD passes muster in many respects.  It is reasonably faithful to the story and the production is good but its one downfall is casting.

Dustin Hoffman was not actually my idea of Barney's detective dad but is, nevertheless, excellent. Blair was OK but needed to be more satirized.  Similarly,  Minnie Driver takes the role of Barney's obnoxious, but well-meaning, second wife quite delightfully beyond the reader's imagination.

The appearance of the main character, Barney, is far too reminiscent of the presenter in ""Mythbusters"" even down to the short ginger, curly hair and is borderline OK despite Gaimatti's reasonable acting. To have taken the prototype of the unruly haired Mordecai Richler himself (who appears in the ""Special Features"" on the DVD) would have been far more convincing.

The druggsy, Buggsy is just too over-the-top Hollywood to be believable. The way directors allow alcoholic characters, schizophrenics and the like such free reign is getting pretty tedious.

Despite what others have said, my one real disappointment was my favorite character, Miriam. The quiet dignity and depth of Miriam's character in the book just didn't fit with the bright-eyed face and slender figure of someone more fitted to modeling women's underwear in a Sears' catalogue. That's not to say that Rosamund Pike didn't do a valiant job but she just wasn't Miriam to begin with.  The frilly icing on top of this was, not only did Miriam not age over the span of 40 years, or so, but she actually appeared younger. Maybe it was vanity. The absence of aging make-up could have been a condition of the contract if Rosamund wished to remain so bright-eyed and bushy tailed in the public's mind - for future occasions.  Good luck to her I say, she would actually be excellent and well worth watching if cast in a  more suitable part.

Overall, the movie is well worth watching but, as is often the case, slightly disappointing if you've identified too closely with the real characters in Mordecai Richler`s  book.",1312588800,,2069,5.014619883040936

4483897,4,B004VQRCCI,"Based on a novel by Mordecai Richer.  The film was 12 years in the making and when finally finished several Canadian actors made cameo appearances.  Tales focuses on a man in the twilight of his years looking back on his life, most notably those of his three wives with a slight subplot of whether he murdered his best friend or not.  The acting is high end and I can see why Giamatti got best comedy actor by the Golden Globe.  Rosamund Pike plays his third soulmate wife who isn't able to forgive him (even though one could argue the husband's drunken action was related to her time spent with an associate she later ends up marrying in the tale) but still remains in his life.  Dustin Hoffman plays his crass blue collar style father and Minnie Driver is the main character's overbearing second wife.

Barney's Promise starts a little slow but quickly finds its footing and soon becomes one of the most intelligent and honestly emotional new films I've seen in the past few years. Richler's book gets a crisp script treatment, and one is reminded of what a very funny writer that gentleman was. His work is all about people being human, and Giamatti gets right to the heart of Barney, a very sweet and sour fellow.

Pike is the other lynchpin here, and her scenes with PG are often revelatory. THIS is what acting looks like! And feels like. There's a lot of feel in this film, and you can tell by the way it keeps getting better that the whole crew knew as it was being made that they were creating something special.

Hoffman takes an over the top part and plays it just below the hilt, and makes it work. His scenes with PG are also gems. Which is of course due, as with Pike, to Giamatti as much as to Hoffman. PG was waiting for a role this juicy, and as with his perfect Miles in Sideways, you can't begin to imagine any one else in this role.

This is not a kids' movie; it's for adults who've loved and lost and seen the cycles of life played out a few times, and can laugh and cry at all that comes with that. I did plenty of both, and I haven't cried at a movie in a while. This is a very honest family movie, as in how screwed up most families tend to be, but also how much love there is under the surface. And hate. And so much else.

The laughs are often killers, as in the wedding, the best movie nuptials I've seen since Diner...and that was a while back! There are some viciously funny skewers here, most straight from Richler's wonderfully acid pen. He would have loved this version of Barney, above all the truly Oscar-worthy performance by Paul Giamatti.",1310342400,3,1782,4.275964391691395

4483900,4,B004VQRCCI,"Can't say as I know where this came from. I don't remember hearing about it and when it popped up it looked well worth giving a try. It was.

This is a slice of life flick. Quiet, medium paced with no frou frou, but it has a subtle build.

Here's the scoop. Paul Giamotti plays a schlock TV producer Barney. A detective writes a book implicating Barney in a murder. Barney subsequently takes some time to reflect upon his life, his three wives and his general approach to things.

The director, Richard J. Lewis, is a TV director so this comes as a surprise. This has a certain elegance one doesn't usually find in TV productions, and it isn't paced for commercial breaks. It is as smooth as silk and, at 2 hours 14 min. I wasn't looking at my watch, which is a good thing. It's Giamotti's movie plain and simple. Dustin Hoffman does a great job as his retired, beat cop father. Some complained that the womens' rolls weren't written that well and I can't argue. You really don't get to meet the first wife before she offs herself so she's little more than a sketch. Minnie Driver is good enough as the second wife but it's too much of a J.A.P. stereotype so there isn't much for her to chew on. Rosamund Pike gets the best of the wives' roll as Miriam. It's still a bit shy but not bad.

This is simply a good drama. Barney is not a great guy but you still get to like him, warts and all. And when things go south for him in the third act you truly care for him and how the loose ends in his life will work out. The way the murder was resolved was both clever and satisfying for me.

4483903,4,B004VQRCCI,"BARNEY'S VERSION is one of those movies that critics love. They talk about the depth of the story, the fantastic acting, the way the movie felt and looked. And for once those who would discuss these and others items of the film have it right. This is one fine movie.

Paul Giamatti stars as Barney Panofsky, a studio producer looking back at his life. When it opens we see him doing his best to disrupt the life of his ex-wife by calling her husband at 3AM. From there we see him stopping at his favorite bar only to be hassled by an ex-police detective who's just released a book about the murder of Barney's best friend Boogie (Scott Speedman), a murder that the detective still believes Barney committed. But the body was never found. This confrontation leads to Barney's reflecting on his life.

We're taken back to the early 70s when Barney was living in Europe surrounding himself with bohemian friends all interested in art. But this isn't a world Barney can be a part of, just an observer of. He marries a free spirit believing he is the father of her child only to part ways with her once the baby is lost and he discovers there was no way he was the father. On a binge with his friend Boogie, he misses a message and goes to his wife only to find she's committed suicide.

Barney returns to Canada where he gets work with his uncle and eventually becomes a studio head. Along the way he is introduced to a young woman who catches his eye played by Minnie Driver. This woman is a non-stop talker whose father is a wealthy man. He also possesses the attitudes of such a man, greatly displayed when a dinner for the two prior to their marrying is held. Barney's father Izzy (Dustin Hoffman), an ex-cop, is invited to dinner only to have Driver's father offer him angry glances and demeaning comments.

At the wedding things are going as planned. Barney's friends are there, the party is in full swing and much heavy drinking follows. While watching the hockey game at the reception, and after far too many drinks, Barney is told that his father in law has made comments about his own father. Heading to have it out with the man, he gets a glimpse of a woman that he finds amazing. After the confrontation with his father in law finishes, he meets this woman, Miriam (Rosamund Pike). Enamored with her, he follows her to the train station and asks her to run off with him. She turns him down but remains in his heart.

The story continues involving all of these characters but to attempting to describe the story without giving away too much is just ridiculous. Suffice to say that Barney does lead and interesting life. And he eventually finds an amazing love that stays with him forever. But with each step he takes, Barney seems destined to screw things up. He doesn't want to, it just seems that he always takes the wrong turn.

The film won an Oscar for make up and it was well deserved. The progression in age for Giamatti is amazing to watch. In one of the extras he discusses how much it helped his performance, giving him a reference point with which to grab hold of his character at that time in his life. Giamatti also won the Golden Globe for his performance here and he deserved that as well. This is one of the best things he's ever done.

The film may be a bit long for some, may take a while to unwind that today's fast paced movie goers might not want to sit for. But in doing so you'll find a full, rich story that is better than most told these days. And in the end you'll discover a few truly touching moments and that at the heart of it all is a love story that's as sweet as they come.",1309392000,8,3613,4.375558867362146
