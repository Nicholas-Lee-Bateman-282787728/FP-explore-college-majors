2911193,5,B000TXY2DY,"Giacomo Puccini is very well served in this production of Il Trittico.  I've never had the luxury of seeing all three operas together.  I saw Suor Angelica in San Francisco around 1990 with Leona Mitchell (paired with I Pagliacci) and Gianni Schicchi in Los Angeles a couple of years ago with Samuel Ramey (paired with Bartok's Blubeard's Castle).  When I watched this video, I was not expecting Renata Scotto or any of the others.  Amarilli Nizza more than holds her own vocally and dramatically, as well as the uniformly good cast.  The singing, conducting, staging & video quality are all excellent.  I had never heard of any of the cast members, but the first couple of 5 star reviews encouraged me to order this DVD.  And I am so glad to have seen it and to add my own 5 stars.  I for one am not pining for that elusive past golden age, but rather grateful for the high quality of what is available today.  However, I must confess that I hope the Met will release the Scotto Trittico on DVD one of these days.  ""Madonna salvami.""",1195344000,26,1034,4.481283422459893
2911194,4,B000TXY2DY,"You had two reviews - one long and very good (with one minor error) and a short one that was written by someone who did not watch the video and credited another conductor.  Mr. Birman got it right in general.  I would disagree with the assessment of the soprano.  I think she is in way over her head.  If you love O Mio Babbino Caro and Senza Mamma, listen elsewhere.  If she was so good, where was the applause?  She got none.  The baritone got bravos.  I have heard Hai ben Raggione sung much better also.  Overall, a good, fresh approach and appreciated here.",1193184000,14,562,4.326923076923077
2911195,5,B000TXY2DY,"Puccini was a crowd pleaser but even he couldn't ignore the currents of musical change following in the wake of Debussy, Schoenberg and Stravinsky. Debussy's influence is obvious in his score for La fanciulla del west, produced at the Met Dec. 10, 1910. The advent of the First World War caused musical downsizing between 1914-1918 for everyone, so Puccini produced three one act operas with slighly smaller orchestral forces which also premiered at the Met Dec. 14, 1918. The score is masterful, pointing towards a future Puccini only partially fulfilled with the unfinished Turandot of 1926. Puccini died before creating the modernist work he might have produced following Berg's Wozzeck and Lulu.

This production of Il Trittico, recorded live at the Teatro Comunale di Modena, 8 February 2007 is fresh, insightful and entertaining. Both Il tabarro and Suor Angelica are spared dirge-like productions in director Cristina Pezzoli's clean, crisp versions of the first two operas of Puccini's triptych. She removes everything superfluous, leaving behind the essence of the two harrowing plays. Both the Verismo in Il tabarro and the religious ecstasy of Suor Angelica are not over emphasized. The drama is naturalistic, the sets and costumes spare and stylized, so we are never forced into a downward spiral of bathos. The female lead in all three operas is Amarilli Nizza and she is splendid, obviously the singing and acting star of this production. The rest of the cast is equally as good.

The final opera is, as always, the most entertaining, the most fun of the three. This Gianni Schicchi, a tale of rampant greed and fraudulent wills that is based on a story from Dante, now updated to the era of it's composition, is wonderful. With imaginatively designed and beautifully realized comic costumes, and a simple but effective set, the performers shine. Surrounded by all of this artfully done comic freedom, they sing and act with natural comedic grace. It is very refreshing to see such creative excellence. This is my favorite Gianni Schicchi thus far on DVD. Alberto Mastromarino, the rotund, treacherous but hilarious Schicchi, is a hoot! It's a performance that will remain with you a long time. The Orchestra della Fondazione Arturo Toscanini and the Coro Lirico Amadeus, conducted by Julian Reynolds (not Nello Santi), play and sing splendidly. The entire large cast is excellent. Sound is exemplary in Dolby Digital 5.1, with an effect that is beautifully natural. Voices are wrapped in a spacious soundfield: airy and surrounded by/enfolded within their natural stage distances. Costumes are abstract, beautiful, funny and colorful. I adored their comic book wit. Sets are simply designed and very effective. There was creative intelligence involved in this production and it shows.

Modern and stylized, serious in the first two operas, very funny in the last, this is a splendid Il Trittico. Most strongly recommended.

2911196,5,B000TXY2DY,"this is the best trittico ever on DVD - soprana Amarilli Nizza is amazing, as good as, or better than Renata Scotto's performance.  Nello Santi conducts beautifully.  This is a must have DVD",1191024000,16,190,4.7272727272727275
2911197,5,B000TXY2DY,"Edit 11/26/2012:
This is for the Amarilli Nizza/Alberto Mastromarino version. Amazon has suddenly lumped this together with the Teatro Alla Scala production, which I have not seen and my review does not apply to that version.

Edit 2/5/12:
I have listened to Il tabarro (the first opera of the three) again after some change in my set-up with better bass management and at a 3 db louder level.
Soundstage is 160 degrees, with the harp and the double basses coming right out of the left surround, triangle out of the right sourround. You close your eyes and the voices move in front of you across the stage in a diagonal way as the boat is diagonally on the stage. Excellent depth. You can't create that any better. Audiowise, it is really on par with Mahler's 9th and La Gazetta (see my reviews). Reference recording that gets better as it gets louder. End of edit.

Picture quality is excellent.
I listened to the DTS - MA 7.1 surround track and found the recording quality somewhere between very good and excellent. The sound stage is quite wide and very deep. A tad more use of the surround channels to widen the stage a bit more and bring the applause more from the back and I would have called it excellent.
The principal singers carry microphones on their bodies, but well hidden. There are only a handful of shots where you see a hint of a microphone. The voices move along as the singers move, so they don't come out only through the center speaker. The orchestra and chorus are well balanced and hardly ever drown the principals. The benefit of carrying microphones. Overall, very enjoyable to listen to and one of the better sound recordings.
Much to my surprise, the sound engineer isn't even mentioned in the booklet, let alone on the cover. You have to wait for the final credits to find out it's Elfride Foroni. Please give the woman some credit in the booklet!",1293840000,3,1875,4.610778443113772
2911198,5,B000TXY2DY,"I bought this DVD some time ago, and never watched it.  However, today, it took the challenge.  I enjoyed it very much.  Basically I am completely unfamiliar with the singers, but they were excellent.  The orchestra was good. The productions were interesting, and the religiosity of Angelica, was respected with taste, not ignored ala the Met.  I'm glad I have this in my collection.",1279411200,,383,4.921875
2911199,5,B000TXY2DY,"IMPORTANT NOTE: The review below is for the TDK issue featuring Amarilli Nizza and should not be showing for the La Scala production with Barbar Frittoli.  It was originally posted correctly for the TDK production but for some reason is also appearing incorrectly as a review of the La Scala production. Deleting or editing it at either place changes it both places - hence this note.

Each of these three short operas (thankfully in traditional settings) are different and that adds to the enjoyment of this disc.

The first ""The Cloak"" starts off slowly and sets an atmosphere of boredom which slowly reveals an affair between the young wife of the barge owner and a casual employee. The tension rises to finish with inevitable tragedy. The acting and singing is first class with the lovely Amarilli Nizza particularly impressive.

The second opera ""Sister Angelica"" using music and acting very effectively sets the stultifying atmosphere of the convent but this slowly and effectively changes to one of pathos as the past life of Angela is revealed. Again, the singing and acting are engrossing and a tribute to the artistic genius of Puccini, a man not immune to scandal in his own love life.

The third opera ""Gianni Schicchi"" is also on another BD disc and, on balance, I prefer the Glynedebourne production. But that is not to condemn this comic production which again highlights the avarice and hypocracy of relatives greedy to have a share of the inheritance of their ""beloved"" Buoso Donati. The roles are deliberately and effectively over acted and accompanied by good singing. However some effort could have been made to have the dead Donati to be as corpulant as the imposter Schicchi for that substitution to have been a little more believable. But that is nit picking.

Audio and video are up to the usual high BD standards and I came away very impressed with the talents of Amarilla Nizza in three completely different and challenging roles and also impressed with the three different styles of composition by Puccini. Recommended.

[[I wanted to buy this opera because I was going to see ""Sour Angelica"" in the theater and I like to get familiar with the music. I had seen one of the metropolitan versions on TV and at that time I didn't like it so much, maybe because I was expecting something else or I wasn't in the mood, which means that I bought this DVD with a lot of misgiving but I am glad to have done it. I decided for this version because all the reviewers were very good.
Even though the scenery was very plain, like some paintings of the beginning of the XX century, it was very effective, representing the hard life and frustrations of its characters.
In ""Il Tabarro"" the acting was very good in spite of the abrupt ending.
Then ""Sour Angelica"" the submission of the nuns who take a vow for one or another reason and shut themselves away in a convent and the main character isolated and abandoned by her relatives for having a son out of wedlock were very well captured.
The last opera is completely different, treated like a buffo theater, with ridiculous  costumes and acting, that express the greed of all Bouso's relatives waiting for his will after his death which Gianni Schicchi changed at there request .In a way he punished these people and is able to help his daughter with the change he makes in Buoso's will.
Alberto Mastromarino,Amarilli Nizza and Annamaria Chiuri were very convincing in their acting and singing in the different roles they performed.
The sound , scenery and most important the cast are very good.",1263686400,4,1551,4.595667870036101
2911202,5,B000TXY2DY,"From the first moment of this DVD, I felt I had something special coming...and I was correct.  This is a treat from start to finish, an amazing performance all around with great sound.  My sense of the performance echoes most of the other reviews.

I would say to one of the 4-star reviewers that having an aversion to ""sad"" is a major impediment to being an opera fan.  I don't envy you (I love the sad). And I would say to the 1-star reviewer, please don't sully performances with a terrible review when your complaint is merely administrative -- and your error at that.

A very very satisfying performance, one I will go back to again and again.",1261353600,5,648,4.4576271186440675
2911203,5,B000TXY2DY,"I just finished watching the gorgeous production from Teatro Comunale di Modena and can only say if you love Trittico as I do, you must have this set - and priced as it is it's a steal!

First, all three, distinctive sets by Giacomo Andrico, costumes by Gianluca Fataschi and lighting by Cesare Accetta are nothing short of marvelous, each setting the mood of the piece as soon as the curtain rises.

For Il Tabarro we're plunged into dismal, watery world under the large arch of a Parisian bridge, the barge a depressing and effective playing area, where shadows loom everywhere. The colors and light effects are sensational.

For Suor Angelica, we're in an enormous vaulted room of shifting columns, with set pieces unobtrusively moved into place to change the settings throughout in a way I've not seen done before - even an enormous fountain glides into place for several spectacular effects in the first and final scenes. The miracle is beautifully staged, with a child Madonna leading Angelica's son toward his mother, the son racing to and falling onto and embracing his mother for a touching reunion of smiles before both expire, the little Madonna smiling down on them. Talk about lump in your throat moments!

Schicchi makes me wonder why any director would want to update it, the massive period set evoking the era, but the over-the-top costumes, elaborate wigs, ridiculous hats all like a renaissance painting come to life - save for Schicchi who first appears in a pinstriped suit.

Christina Pezzoli's direction in all three operas brings real theatre into the proceedings, all of the characters richly detailed, stripped (mostly) of old-fashioned cliches and rich with life.

Alberto Mastromarino shines both as Michele and Schicchi, even when his voice sometimes (rarely) threatens to break under pressure. For the most part he sings beautifully and he shows that even a corpulent singer/actor can learn to move and act with grace, style and be a physically thrilling performer. He is that and more - and his curtsey (still in Buoso's gown) at the end is charm itself. Dark, violently threatening as Michele, his Schicchi is fleet and light as a feather. I want to see more of this guy!

Amarilli Nizza pulls off the operatic equivalent of a hat trick nailing all three of the heroines. She is a wildly physical Giorgietta in her flapper get up, complete with garters, stockings and head band. She is both hope and sorrow personified as Angelica, and pulls off a shrewd, if slightly long in the tooth Lauretta, all winks and knowing nods. In one delicious bit of irony, ""O mio babbino caro,"" is sung while daddy pulls her into his coat. It's little touches like this that Ms. Pezzoli injects throughout all three operas that give them a wonderful sense of theatricality. Nizza's voice is an exciting one, not always beautiful of sound, especially when pushing it in the mid range, but she has the most secure and thrilling top I've heard in a soprano in ANY of these roles in a very, very long time. Her high c at the end of the ""Lodiam"" sequence is thrilling and goes on forever.

Also in Schicchi, the movement from all of the singers is choreographed to the music in an almost comedic balletic fashion that brings it vividly to life. (Though I must say, I've rarely, if ever, seen this particular opera not done well).

The rest of the casts are all marvelous actors and (mostly) good singers, particularly Rubens Pelizzari as Luigi, who several times resembles the young, handsome Pavarotti. His murder at Michele's hands is terrifying, Michele plunging his head into the river, Luigi coming up gasping for air, soaking wet it's positively lugubrious!

The Orchestra della Fondazione Arturo Toscanini and the Coro Lirico Amadeus led by Julian Reynolds is in top form and the entire thing flew by so beautifully and quickly I couldn't believe 3+ hours had come and gone.

I (obviously) can't say enough good things about this one!",1244937600,6,3949,4.852897473997028
2911204,5,B000TXY2DY,"This is a beautiful production of Puccini's Il trittico. Il Tabarro has a beautiful convincing cast. Luigi's singing is beautiful and his love duet with Giorgetta will bring tears to your eyes. I found it very erotic when Luigi is lying on top of Giorgetta. The only complaint about il tabarro is puccini's fault to leave us at the end of the opera speechless and cold. If only he would have extended it a little bit longer. I think that last chord ends really fast, when Giorgetta looks what her husband is hiding under his long coat....ups!!! is her strangled lover - she sings out a loud cry in disbelief and boom the opera is over. Personally Suor Angelica is full of new theatrical tricks. I love how the nuns at the end bring crosses that will attach to the ground. Very Theatrical and beatifuly done. Suor Angelica is an opera that only with the music it tells me a lot so the production even though is bad, the music still emotionally moves me. The only complaint is - what the hell was the producer thinking about the black crow on Suor Angelicas Aunt's hat?. She is supposed to be a Princess you know? I don't get it. A black crow is ugly. I should be a white dove. I know that the princess is bringing bad news. Is that why she has a black crow on her hat? Please explain. Gianni Schicchi my most favorite of the three is funny but I would love to see Gianni Schicchi a little bit more funny. At some points I think he looked nervous but, the rest of the cast were pretty funny. I loved the conga line when Gianni Schicchi was reading the testament. Overall my praise goes to the diva who sang; Giorgetta, Suor Angelica and Lauretta.  (Amarilli Nizza) Her characterizations where very convincing.",1242432000,12,1707,4.436305732484076

The singers are very good indeed and they have been given superb recorded sound and video quality.",1225152000,3,412,4.774647887323944
2911206,5,B000TXY2DY,"To the aim an audio-visual assembly that does justice to this lyrical monument. Surpassing to by the other commendable version of the Scala of Milan, star flood (Sass, Cappuccilli, Plowright, Pons, among others); this version of the theater Comunale de Modena impeccably displays the three pieces that separately, as lamentably it appears sometimes in the scenes, are worthy in their own merit, but that together in the order wanted by Puccini, they obtain a powerful, stirring effect and that grows implacably in the development of the day. Indeed, at the outset we have the history of the Tabarro, perfect in dramatic and full progression of the details so wanted by the author (songs outside the scene, parallel actions, lovely secondary personages, smallness), until arriving at the atrocious crime in the middle of our compassion to all the protagonists. We continue with the history of Suor Angelica, exquisite music with a gallery of adorable secondary feminine voices and the doublet: Love of Mother - Divinity, that affects until the tears with the final miracle (deplored sometimes, laboriously omitted as in the case of the version of La Scala) inevitable with the progression of the text and the supernatural music of sensitivity never before written by the author. Already won, we attended the gift of Gianni Schicchi with its healthy humor, of vertiginous action and a robust affection that cheers until the wonderful end with the greeting to the Master Dante and the ""extenuating one to us"" of the adorable loafer.

In this version there are no recognized stars internationally and less divos, and nevertheless everything works very well, emphasizing the Amarilli Nize that dispatches the three protagonists without problems and with characterizations very adapted without problems with the tesietura (unlike the Stratas in version of the MET), although in the Suor Angelica it does not arrive at the implicancia level that the Plowright (version the Scala). In as much, the baritone Alberto Mastromarino assumes without complexes the Michelle (with the terrible competition of Cappuccilli-Scala and Pons-Met), with the suitable identification with the stormy protagonist of the Tabarro and an outstanding action, whereas with the Gianni and his look of Capo of the Mafia, develops authoritarian as his personage surpassing to Pons must (this one time in version of La Scala). Mezzo soprano Amarilli Nice is overwhelming in its three interventions: The Frugola, the Zia Principessa, and the Zita. The tenors have great competition, and although nobody can with Placido Domingo in the Tabarro (version MET) the Luigi de Rubens Pelizzari fulfills and convinces in its erotic implicancia with Giorgetta-Nice, whereas Andrea Giovannini is simply perfect like Rinuccio.

It emphasizes the stage scenes, clothes (particularly inspired the one of Gianni with his references it seems me that the personages of the Commedia Of the Art), and the particularly suitable televising handling to the action (some seen unpublished of the romance and crime of the Tabarro and additions the architecture and stairs of the monastery of Suor Angelica).

That we waited for a labor of this height for one of the majors works of Puccini and, it long ago yes tenth, of the history of the musical theater.",1217635200,2,3296,5.274285714285714
8211353,1,B000TXY2DY,"Not as good aspects:
- Absolutely boring stage direction. I fell asleep during Il tabarro, which never took advantage of the built-in tension included in the opera. Suor Angelica was similarly lackluster and picked up steam way too late. Stopped watching before I could see what I assume would have been an extremely underwhelming Gianni Schicchi (one of my favorite operas).
- Amarilli Nizza is the opposite of a compelling actress. She clearly is focused on sound production that the drama suffers.
- Many of the comprimario in Il tabarro didn't belong on the stage, or a recording for that matter. Tabarro's secondary characters make a bad production unwatchable at times.

Good aspects:
- Underutilized sets by Giacomo Andrico are massive and beautiful. With more changes in lighting and active direction, they could have lived up to their potential.
- Very fine performances by the secondary characters in Suor Angelica. Annamaria Chiuri was great in her scene dispite the odd crow's hat.",1516406400,,993,5.12962962962963
8211354,5,B000TXY2DY,"I am very impressed with this DVD of Il Trittico.  The productions are new and very refreshing.
The singing is all around excellent, but it especially shines in Il Tabarro.  Alberto Mastromarino is terrific as Michele, as are the Giorgetta and Luigi.
Because the sets for Suor Angelica are so austere, the donkey doesn't appear, but two nuns enter with the baskets on their backs, tied together by a rope (?).  Puccini wrote into the score a wonderful brief reference to a braying donkey, so, unless you know what that's all about, it might be a little confusing.  The ending is the best idea I have seen so far.  It should satisfy the realists or the viewers who want to see the miracle --- very clever.  Amarilli Nizza is outstanding as Suor Angelica.
The deviation from 13th century costumes for Gianni Schicchi are a surprise, and when Schicchi enters in his three piece suit, I didn't know quite what to make of it and had to refer to the booklet to understand.
While I prefer Juan Pons' interpretation of Gianni Schicchi, Mastromarino does a very good job with the role.

Puccini conceived of the idea of a trilogy some years before he was able to find the material. One of the attractions of the idea was that he would be freed from the restraints of the longer 3 act format and be able to create a more concentrated `verismo' drama with one concentrated dramatic statement per opera.

The first to be written was Il Tabarro. Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi followed some time later when time was more pressured and both were written at the same time. All three operas deal with contrasting events surrounding death. Il Tabarro is a dark drama where infidelity leads to a crime of passion whereby the adulterer is finally killed by the husband. Suor Angelica is a harrowing tale whereby a young girl, sent to a convent by her vindictive aunt to atone for having an illegitimate child, finally commits suicide in order to join her now dead child in Heaven. In Gianni Schicchi the death of a rich relative leads to a Dickensian comedy whereby the relatives attempt to change the terms of the will. Puccini's idea was to have all three performed as a complete evening's drama but frequently the outer two are performed in tandem with other short operas and Suor Angelica is performed rarely although it was Puccini's own favourite.

These operas are staged very much as Puccini intended in this production. Il Tabarro is set on a barge underneath a bridge archway in the 1920 period. Suor Angelica is set in a nunnery of an indeterminate early period, cleverly making use of sliding units of scenery to vary the locations. Gianni Schicchi is set in Florence in medieval times with entertainingly extravagant costumes and hairstyles which add nicely to the comedic narrative.

Two singers are common to all three operas. Amarilli Nizza takes the lead soprano role and delivers fine and differentiated performances with total vocal and dramatic mastery. She explores the roles of the disenchanted and adulterous wife, the victimised but not weak Sister Angelica and the humorous side of Lauretta in Schicchi with complete conviction. Her identification with the fate of Sister Angelica clearly causes her distress at the curtain calls and is a mark of her committed performance.  Annamaria Chiuri takes on the supporting roles of a caring impoverished wife to one of the barge workers in Il Tabarro, as the unpleasant princess in Suor Angelica and as the miserly and grasping older relative in Schicchi. Like Amarilli Nizza she is completely successful in all three contrasting roles.

Alberto Mastromarino takes the leading male role as the wronged husband and eventual murderer in Il Tabarro and as the highly humorous and wiley Schicchi in the last opera. That he is able to deliver such fine and gripping performances of these two very contrasting roles is no mean tribute to both his acting and vocal skills.

The various supporting parts in all three operas are equally well delivered. In particular, Rubens Pelizzari is a convincing adulterer with a strong and ringing tenor in Il Tabarro and Andrea Giovannini as the young Rinuccio sings his role strongly with a nice sense of good humoured loyalty to both Schicchi and his intended Lauretta. There are too many other supporting roles to be listed in all three casts but one can summarise by stating that there is not one weak point to be heard or seen anywhere.

The orchestra plays with vigour and sensitivity under Julian Reynolds and the sound is realistically presented in both DTS 7.1 and stereo. Everything on stage and in the orchestra is clearly audible but some may find the audience applause rather distantly balanced but I did not find this a serious detraction given the overall excellence of the sound. The camera work is fully involving with crisp imaging and a full range of colour.

I have found this to be a very satisfying production and performance of this trilogy and it is well able to stand comparison with the best alternatives that are available, being superior to most. The `traditional' settings will be an additional attractive bonus for many purchasers. In my opinion this should give considerable satisfaction to future purchasers and well deserves a 5 star rating on that basis.",1347321600,2,4335,4.912568306010929

Review relating to Teatro Comunale de Modena / Reynolds

This trilogy by Puccini is a very powerful dramatic and operatic experience when experienced as a whole and in as good a performance as here.

That he is able to deliver such fine and gripping performances of these two very contrasting roles is no mean tribute to both his acting and vocal skills.

The various supporting parts in all three operas are equally well delivered. In particular, Rubens Pelizzari is a convincing adulterer with a strong and ringing tenor in Il Tabarro and Andrea Giovannini as the young Rinuccio sings his role strongly with a nice sense of good humoured loyalty to both Schicchi and his intended Lauretta. There are too many other supporting roles to be listed in all three casts but one can summarise by stating that there is not one weak point to be heard or seen anywhere.

The orchestra plays with vigour and sensitivity under Julian Reynolds and the sound is realistically presented in both DTS 7.1 and stereo. Everything on stage and in the orchestra is clearly audible but some may find the audience applause rather distantly balanced but I did not find this a serious detraction given the overall excellence of the sound. The camera work is fully involving with crisp imaging and a full range of colour.

I have found this to be a very satisfying production and performance of this trilogy and it is well able to stand comparison with the best alternatives that are available, being superior to most. The `traditional' settings will be an additional attractive bonus for many purchasers. In my opinion this should give considerable satisfaction to future purchasers and well deserves a 5 star rating on that basis.",1347321600,2,4882,4.985257985257985
8211359,4,B000TXY2DY,"Three different one act operas. Adultery, tragedy of a non-married mother, and comic trickery sum up the three acts. Puccini succeeded in giving each one of the operas its character.
The production of Il tabarro is beautiful. In addition to the music the video shots are masterly done. Interesting to note, that the audience may be at a disadvantage as the different angles the video is shot is not available to the life audience. BlueRay technology excels here.
After Il tabarro, Sour Angelica disappoints a little. The moving columns are somehow confusing, at least in the video production. It is possible that for the life audience it is less of a problem. In addition, the appearance of the boy with an angel is not climatic enough.
Gianni Schicchi is funny and entertaining. The costumes seemed to me as an exaggeration and distraction from the music. Puccini created, with the libretto and the music, enough character for the greed of the Donati family. There is still some controversy if the ""O mio babbino caro""aria's character fits the rest of the opera, but there is no doubt it is a beautiful aria. For some reason, it lacks enough Umpff.
The three operas are produced in the ""traditional"" way. The music and the singers are very good. The overall human expressions are there as Puccini probably wanted. The sound is great and the filming is good.  Recommended for an enjoyable evening and, Gianni Schicchi in particular, a good show to introduce someone to the world of opera",1316131200,3,1487,4.854330708661418

8211361,5,B000TXY2DY,"From the Teatro Communale di Modena, the birthplace of opera legends Pavarotti and Freni, comes this fantastic production of ""Il Trittico"".
Although the singers are not well known,do not hesitate to add this DVD to your collection.
Production values are far superior to any other production on DVD or VHS tape, and even to the productions that I've seen on the stage.  I cann't count the times that I have watched this DVD.
The three operas are great, although my favorite is SOUR ANGELICA, ironically, of the three operas it has been the least successful of the set, being Gianni Schicchi the most popular.
When Il Trittico had its world premiere in 1918 at The Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the newspapers praised Schicchi but were very unkind to Sour Angelica.
Before it opened at the MET, Puccini himself played it at the convent where his own sister was a nun, and they loved it!
I was very impressed with Amarilli Nizza, the soprano,she did a great job in the three operas, not a small feat; just getting through Angelica it's quite something.
Beverly Sills wrote in one of her books that she sang Sour Angelica only once, because when she finished it, she was so drained that she couldn't put herself through it again!
What is interesting is that each opera is so different from each other,one a tale of adultery and murder, the other a miracle at a convent, and the third one a very fine comedy!! And all highly enjoyable on their own.
But if you buy only one version of Il Trittico, make  it this one. You'll go back to it, over and over.",1314057600,3,1555,4.56989247311828
8211362,5,B000TXY2DY,"I just discovered these three short operas because I wanted everything by Puccini; and it is so rare to find them together or to have them performed together.....what a shame. I view them as wonderful short stories. We don't always want to read and hear a War and Peace or Les Miserables length opera. So one hour operas are refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable. I have nothing to compare this performance to other than that famous aria from Gianni Schicchi; I first became aware of this incredible aria in the movie a Room with a View starring the then VERY young Helena Bonham Carter. I have no complaint with these gems and delighted to have them in my library; Nizza is not Kiri Te Kenawa, few are.....but she is definitely not over her head.",1298937600,2,745,4.609022556390977
