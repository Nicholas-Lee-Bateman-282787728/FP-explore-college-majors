8698314,5,B00SGSILSQ,"Ok this picks up where the Star Force left Iscandar and is on the way back to Earth just as you think it's over guess who they run into?

Yes the Comet Empire/Gatlantis......

That's all I am going to tell you, don't want to spoil the rest.........",1450569600,2,248,4.25531914893617
8698315,3,B00SGSILSQ,its say it  has english subtitles but it dosent,1448150400,2,47,4.222222222222222
8698316,4,B00SGSILSQ,"Very good - animation is quite good, although the character animation at times is not quite as crisp as the series. The CGI is of course excellent. Decent story and a more thorough introduction to the Comet Empire/Gatlantis race that is sure to be the protagonist in the upcoming Season 2. Really enjoyed it overall.",1446422400,2,316,4.763636363636364
8698317,5,B00SGSILSQ,the long awaited release of this was well worth the wait picks up shortly after the crew leaves earth which was episode 3  with the ship that was waiting to send the yamato off went to the moon to pick up the space marines. The main part is that it takes place just after they leave iscandar episode 25 Lots of action including the final battle which pits the comet empire against the yamato and the gamilons. This is a must for any yamato fans it's worth the money.,1438128000,3,466,4.235955056179775
8698318,5,B00SGSILSQ,If you are a fan of Star Blazers or watched the modernized Yamato 2199 then this is the perfect cap to the series! This side story closes the retelling cycle of the Iscandar series and lays the groundwork for the inevitable confrontation with the White Comet Empire! Cutting edge animation and top notch storytelling collide to add another rich layer to the saga of the Space Battleship Yamato!,1437264000,5,394,4.8088235294117645
