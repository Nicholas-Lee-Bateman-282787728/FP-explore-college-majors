6404160,5,B00K7IPH5I,"X-Men Days of Future Past was a fantastic, phenomenal, well written masterpiece....the best in the series! 10/10

Loved the movie!",1400889600,3,130,5.5
6404161,5,B00K7IPH5I,"There are 3 major Comic Books/Graphic novels  That Changed the landscape of the Comic book Medium
1)Watchman
2)The Dark Knight Returns
3) X-men Days of Future Past

That being said a Studio doing a Story like Days of future Past is Totally ambitious more so then anything Marvel has done thus far!
Don't be fooled by there PR Marvel Phase nonsense
Both Marvel & DC Needs to STOP Jerking-off the moviegoers  (way to many bloody Comic Book Movies this will snap back at them mark my words)
My Review is simple see this film it's so worth the wait and see it in 3-D

Everything comes together to make a solid story driven ""Dark"" Film.
It helps if you seen all the films (This story bridges the gap to link up the Original Films and X-men First Class)
The set pieces are amazing epically the 1973 era  they pulled no punches to created one of the best 1970's Look... And lets be honest to do that I'm sure is must harder then doing a film set now in 2014
The F/X Effects are slick and most look close to perfect
at first I didn't like or Understand why the Future Sentinels  look the way they did but, the story explains that very quick
The 1973 version of the Sentinels looked pretty cool (who ever came up with the design did a good job!)
The Score/Licensed Music used  through-out very cool
The Casting Director Deserves a Huge amount of credit
The Cast is flat out awesome getting live action versions of
Bishop, Warpath, Sunspot, Blink, and Quicksilver is just very cool each actor looked awesome I hope these 5 actors are brought back In Age of Apocalypse
Peter Dinklage delivers another 5 star performance as always!
Jennifer Lawrence was born to play Raven/Mystique her performance carries the film and it keeps everything ""grounded""
Nicholas Hoult,  Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, & Michael Fassbender all deliver too
In fact I really like  James McAvoy  as Charles Xavier  this time around he's just so damaged and broken and it makes sense after the events of X-men First Class
The dude who plays Nixon also really does a good job he really brings out a humanity to the former President
The Story is a bit different from the ""original"" books but, everything they changed did work much better then i thought
The less you know about the story the more you'll Appreciate & Love it Trust Me!
Very cool lil easter eggs like Quicksilver saying my Mom used to date a guy who could bend spoons!!!! wink wink
 you later see Quicksilver with his sister who later becomes The Scarlet Witch  (But, I thought the two were twins?!?! Oh no b! g deal)
I'm sure there are other lil inside gags it's very easy to miss stuff

Spend the Extra few Dollars and see it in 3-D
The 3D Scene with Quicksilver breaking out Eric is just simply stunning  (Best 3D I've seen since Dredd 3D) Keep in mind I'm not in any way a fanboy of the whole 3D Gimmick

My small gripes with the film are simple
This Film should've been a Two Part Movie (Much like The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit)
To put so much  Story into 2hrs and 5min is kind of insane It Deserves more time to go down the rabbit hole and flush out the Future and the Past....  Hopefully we get  a Ultimate Director's Cut on blu ray
I wish during the scene with the Military in the East (It wasn't Vietnam forgot what it was over around there) I wish you either seen Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth)  or Frank Castle (aka The Punisher) serving in the Military That would've been a very cool lil Easter egg
Also when Logan returns to the future there is no mention to where is he (time wise) It's very misleading My guess after the events of X-Men and before X-Men 2  (But, that's just a wild guess)
This is without a doubt the Best Film Marvel has put out 9.8/10
I will try my best to go see it at the cinema for a second time
P.S. Make sure you stay for after the credits there is a Easter egg ending hinting at  Age of Apocalypse (don't blink or you'll miss the four horseman in the background)",1400803200,6,3928,4.359396433470508

6404168,5,B00K7IPH5I,"This is not a review of the movie itself since there are countless reviews out there, but instead a review of the collector's edition Magneto Helmet.  There seems to be a great deal of confusion over the size of the helmet, so I photographed mine next to a standard 12-ounce (355 mL) soda can, which is something that everyone can relate to.

The helmet seems to be made out of a dense resin material, and is relatively heavy for its size.  Mine weighed in at 1.67 pounds on the scale (helmet and stand).  As you can see from the photos, it comes as a two-piece item and the helmet sits freely on the stand.  I like it.  It looks nice for what it is, it's not cheap plastic, and it doesn't take up a lot of space on the shelf.",1437696000,14,726,4.15

6404205,1,B00K7IPH5I,"First off, I saw this film in the theaters and thoroughly enjoyed it. My 1 star is the for this Amazon exclusive set. First off, the helmet is a really cheap bonus. It lacks the quality of a ""real"" collectors statue. But what drives me to leave the one star review is the fact that when I finally sat down with the wife to watch the Blu-Ray, the disc was unreadable by my blu-ray player. First I thought maybe they mixed up the 3D and non-3D labeling and tried the 3D disc too... still unreadable. Alas, a third option to watch with the wife... Digital Copy. I go to activate it, ""Cannot activate in your country."" What?! So, apparently the region A disc set does not work in the US. Rant over... bottom line -- Very Disappointing disc set.",1415491200,4,740,4.330935251798561

6404212,3,B00K7IPH5I,I preordered this when it first came out and was very excited that this was going to be a limited edition version but when it arrived I did not recieve what I thought it would be. It was never put in the description during the preorder process that this was only a mini sized replica helmet. I expected to receive a life size version of the helmet and it was not. It is a nice replica but the fact that it was not described until after it was released is what disappoints me.,1414108800,2,475,4.118279569892473
6404213,5,B00K7IPH5I,"Perhaps one of the best X-men movies to date. Knowing full well the story from the comics, I had My reservations when the movie was announced. But Bryan Singer has kept almost all of the X-Men lure close to the comic book. When I saw the movie, I knew it was going to rock, and it did! I couldn't wait for it to come out on Blue-Ray. The storyline is almost identical to the source material, the special effects and acting are top notch. The Blue-Ray transfer is excellent, crisp, very detailed. The sound is awesome, with a 7.1 HD audio, you hear everything crystal clear. The Amazon exclusive comes with Magneto Helmet, a plus for every fan! good for putting it on a desk or a trophy room, next to Wolverine claws! Highest possible recommendation, pick it up!",1414108800,,761,4.482014388489208

6404215,4,B00K7IPH5I,"alas, no, you can't wear the helmet so there goes my Halloween 2014 costume idea.

but as a display piece pretty impressive.

unfortunately had I known when I preordered this item that there is a ""rogue cut"" of the film that will insert the rogue subplot that was cut out of the theatrical release (http://screenrant.com/x-men-days-future-past-rogue-scenes-explained/) scheduled for a 2015 release I would have waited for that instead.

shame on 20th century fox for not going ahead and including the rogue cut on the release knowing this is going to be one of the top holiday season sellers this year!",1414022400,31,602,5.0606060606060606

6404222,1,B00K7IPH5I,"I preordered this box set primarily due to, what was expected to be, the original beautiful packaging of the deluxe edition 3D Blu-Ray combo pack. The price was higher than I usually am willing to spend, but since it was accompanied by a replica helmet and I had previous success with preordering items in the past; I followed suit.

The item was promptly delivered on time upon release, however, the packaging design of the 3D Blu-Ray combo was markedly different from the initial picture.

Needless to say, I am disappointed and dissatisfied. I do not believe Amazon to be the reason for the cover change, but given that a purchase was made with the reasonable assumption that one is buying what is pictured; I hold Amazon responsible for displaying it. As it turned out, the old picture was updated to what it is today.

I would hope that in the future, a disclaimer is posted, letting customers know that what is displayed is a ""tentative"" or ""unofficial"" picture that may not reflect the final, actual product.",1413590400,2,1015,4.755681818181818

The Box is beautifully cased, and once I pulled the helmet out I found it to be actually quite heavy, with heavy detail making it look as if it was battleworn. I initially thought this was going to be plastic and cheap, but is made of steel/metal and looks great. The price online is justified by the realism and quality of the helmet. It is smaller of course than the actual helmet from the movie, but it was definitely larger than expected....very awesome looking helmet based on price...I recommend this highly!!!",1413504000,10,833,4.698630136986301

Bryan Singer returns to the X-Men franchise and brings it back to some classic glory. This time around you have both The older and younger actors in this movie working together. It's a lot of fun and by the time it ends you just want more to happen.

This movie takes place in not only the future but in the 1970's. Wolverine go back into the past and tries help change the future from becoming a place where mutants are no longer welcome. It's not only a fun action movie but also a great mystery of how does the future turn out the way it is and can it be changed.

Bryan Singer brings back the fun and style of the original X-Men movies but makes it feel fresh, fun & new.  I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of the X-Men movies.",1410220800,5,852,4.059523809523809

6404236,5,B00K7IPH5I,"Wow, here is a surprise! A superhero film that does away with flying aliens, big things falling, and cheesy one-liners. Here is a superhero film driven by characters, where the action is tasteful but thrilling, the characters are real, and the stakes are high. Here is a movie where a scene of dialogue contains just as much suspense and drama as an action scene. All this talk of ""dialogue"" and ""character"" is not to say that you will not have an awesome time at the movies! DAYS OF FUTURE PAST rises above the rocky history of the X-Movies to deliver a fast-paced and hugely exciting superhero tour-de-force. Ladies and gents, this is the blockbuster of the year!

Heading this colossal vessel is Bryan Singer (X2, The Usual Suspects), steering with a steady hand and a flair for action. His right-hand man is Simon Kinberg, an uber-smart writer with a deep love of the X-Men. What makes this movie so good is the fact that both Singer and Kinberg are ACTUAL comic book nerds, and their joy and passion for the subject is so infectious you can't help but become swept along. The movie's awesome cast certainly helps. Hugh Jackman is having an absolute blast (look out for the most Wolverine-ish fight-scene since he buried his claws in a SWAT team twelve years ago), once more bringing that great combination of charisma, world-weariness, and animal rage. Back in the game are old hands Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, and it is oh-so-good to have them back! Their respective younger selves, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, bring so much intensity and drama to their roles it's almost criminal. Jennifer Lawrence finally gets to play the wild, dangerous Mystique we've been waiting for, and the rest of the cast gives awesome roles, and each are given their moment to shine.

That's another great thing. If you've always wanted to see the full scope of mutant powers, but felt that the previous films were too focused on Wolverine...this is your day (of future past)! Right from the opening battle scene, Days of Future Past establishes itself with diverse mutant action that will knock your socks off! The stakes are high, the dangers are real, and the music is epic. In particular, Quicksilver's scene in the Pentagon is going to blow you away. This is a man who can give nasty wedgies, get trained guards to punch themselves, and rearrange bullets, in a thousandth of the time it takes a you to say ""Woah"". And this focus on character certainly comes in useful in raising the stakes - and let me tell you, the stakes are HIGH in this movie. Put your hand above your head. Yes, it's higher even than THAT.

To conclude, let me rattle off some adjectives: smart, thrilling, fast, funny, moving, dramatic, and very rubbery. (One of those doesn't belong in there). Bryan Singer has crafted the superhero film of the year: a movie that manages to move with sharp acting and subtle characters, and thrill with ferociously good action. If you like the X-Men, superhero movies, or Hugh Jackman's abs...X-Men: Days of Future Past is a great movie. No, scratch that. This movie is X-cellent!",1401926400,11,3093,4.777570093457944
6404237,5,B00K7IPH5I,"While this is obviously not a direct transfer of comic media to film, X-Men: Days of Future Past DOES manage to make the X-Men prominent silver-screen figures once more.

Wolverine is too tall. I think that is the only real objection that comic nerds might have with this film. The basis of the comic story was Kitty Pryde's consciousness is sent to her younger self to warn the X-Men of an assassination that will enable the government to enlist the aid of giant robot soldiers who will eventually bring about the destructions of mutant and human alike. In the film, the role of Kitty Pryde is played by Wolverine who pulls himself out of his 1973 funk to stop the assassination of Bolivar Trask (played brilliantly by Peter Dinklage).

A lot has happened since X-Men: First Class. Charles Xavier and Hank McCoy live alone in the broken shell of what was once a school for the gifted. Magneto is imprisoned deep underneath the Pentagon. Angel, Banshee and Emma Frost are dead, and Mystique is hunting down the diminutive man responsible. Trask is one step away from giving the Sentinels their bite, and that step is Mystique's DNA. The plot between these two films could have easily made a blockbuster of their own, and given us a chance to see January Jones, Zoe Kravitz and Kaleb Landry Jones once again, but alas. Instead we hear these snippets of dialog exchanged between the younger versions of Xavier and Magneto, at war with each other for most of the movie.

In the dystopian present, Kitty Pryde is on the run from highly advanced adaptive Sentinel robots, along with the mutants Bishop, Warpath, Blink, Sunspot and Colossus. Kitty Pryde has developed the amazing(ly convenient) ability to transport a person's consciousness through time, which gives them the edge against these new hunters and also enables this movie to happen.

Alex Summers makes a brief cameo, along with Spyke, Ink and Toad, and Wolverine has several confrontations and near misses with William Stryker, which makes for a pretty tense scene in Washington.

In spite of convenient placing of super powers and finding another excuse for Wolverine to save the day, this movie turned out to be excellent, and proves beyond any rational doubt that Brian Singer still knows how to make X-Men movies good!",1401840000,2,2280,4.865979381443299
6404238,5,B00K7IPH5I,"There are very few, if any, summer blockbusters that require you to watch six other films just to understand every single detail of what's going on. But when it comes to the array of complex characters, immense action, and constant jumps through time that come with the X-Men series, that will barely touch the surface. You may think that an enormous comic-book franchise like this one only promises amazing special effects and a good deal of one-liners but it's much more than that, and the newest addition ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" proves that with the utmost intensity. Fusing the lead cast of 2011's ""X-Men: First Class"" with the key actors like Hugh Jackman that we all know and love, it's one of the best uses of time-travel we've ever seen on the big-screen.

Set in the near future, we pick up with our characters at the height of a war between mutants and sentinels (robots created for the purpose to hunt down mutants and the people who aid them). Their only hope to prevent an inevitable doom between both races is to send Wolverine back in time to 1973 in order to stop the sentinels from ever being created. But in order to do so, he must enlist the help of young Charles Xavier and Magneto who will help him change history and avert the horrible things to come.

Managing to dive into the heart of the characters like no other film in the series has done, it blew me away in more ways than one. The acting is stupendous all-around with the stand-out being James McAvoy, who pens young Professor X fantastically. Rated PG-13 for action, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is wickedly smart and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.",1401667200,,1654,4.565656565656566

6404240,4,B00K7IPH5I,"Director Bryan Singer (Superman Returns, Usual Suspects), now defending his honor which is why he is not at any of the press junkets, has brought more life into the Marvel X-Men franchise and its called X-Men: Days of Future Past. Muche better than the third installment of the franchise and with the somewhat decent screenplay by Simon Kinberg (Sherlock Holms, Jumper) from a story by Jane Goldman (Stardust, Kick Ass), Mathew Vaughn (The Debt, X-Men: First Class) and Kinberg (Mr. & Mrs. Smith, This Means War), the movie is an adventure in time and space as well as an optimistic view of what the war between mutants and humans could or could not be.

Hugh Jackman (Les Miserable, Real Steele) is back as Logan/Wolverine and he is sent on a mission to go back in time and stop the events that Mystique, played by Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Silver Linings Playbook), is about to do which cause the humans to practically eliminate the entire Mutant race. Having been the only actor to having been in all the six X-Men movies, Hugh has a lot of heart and soul invested into Wolverine and it truly comes across on screen.

Under the guidance and concern of Charles Xavier who is once again brilliantly performed by Patrick Stewart (Legends of Oz: Dorothys Return, Family Guy) and Magneto, again performed masterfully by Ian McKellen (The Hobbit, Doctor Who), who make it clear that Wolverine has to convince their younger selves to make very different and much better choices for everyones future. The on screen chemistry of Hugh, Patrick and Ian is very sharp and you can tell they really love these characters and play them with such sharp intelligence and conviction.

The young Charles Xavier is again reprised by James McAvoy (Wanted, Arthur Christmas) and the young Magneto is again reprised by Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards, Prometheus) and the two have an amazing chemistry of hatred that really creates great electricity for angst and adds to the overall adventures. Later its play for and against Mystique that makes the movie very interesting.

Ellen Page (Inception, Juno) is back as Kitty Pryde and along with Shawn Ashmore (The Following, Fringe) as Iceman/Bobby they defender what is a very gloomy and dark future for mankind and especially the Mutants who are sought out and destroyed by a sentinel-type machines that can defend against any Mutant power. Its Kittys power that allows Wolverine to time travel back into the past.

Some of the new characters include Evan Peters (Kick Ass, Never Back Down) as Quicksilver who has the amazing ability to move very fast (The Flash-like) but has some very funny and wonderfully executed sequence using his speed ability very well. Now the villain in this movie is Dr. Bolivar Trask who is coyly played by Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones, Death At A Funeral) who is responsible for creating these destructive machines that kill the Mutants.

Yes, you get to see some of our favorite and familiar faces again like Storm, Halle Berry (Cloud Atlas, Extant), Beast, Nicholas Hoult (About A Boy, Jack the Giant Slayer), Bishop, Omar Sy (Mood Indigo, Jurassic World) and even some great witty cameos by Rogue, Anna Paquin (The Piano, True Blood), Daniel Cudmore (Twilight: New Moon, The Killing Machine) as Colossus, Framke Janssen (The Wolverine, A Fighting Man) as Jean Grey/Pheonix, Kelsey Grammer (Fraiser, Boss)as the older Hank/Beast and James Marsden (Hairspray, Enchanted) as Cyclops/Scott Summers.

Overall the movie is rich in character and story, although a little thick in the detailed part, but still very enjoyable to watch the team really fights a practically unbeatable enemy. John Ottman (Superman Returns, Fantastic Four) and his score are right in sync with heroism of the movie and he even tweaked the 20th Century Fox opening fanfare  something the entire audience caught and cheered for. Certainly not a disappointment as far as sequels go, X-Men: Days of Future Past is thoroughly entertaining and character driven  with a slight story confusion only holding its pace, the whole family should have fun with this.

6404241,5,B00K7IPH5I,"X-traordinarily perfect! Ive been waiting for this movie for a while and what a payoff.
The future, as we know it, is a wasteland for mutants: hunted and eliminated by the Sentinels. To stop this from ever happening, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent into the past to prevent this dark outcome.

I adore the X-Men series and to see it again is beyond fantastic. Bringing back the original iconic actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto) makes me overjoyed! Even the younger versions of them - Micheal Fassbender and James McAvory are their own 3-dimensional characters because they're not trying to be replicas of their older selves. Their interaction and relationships are strong and, just as in X-Men First Class, I love seeing Eric and Xavier just talking. These two started as friends and the film shows that perfectly. They have different pathways and ways to fix events but they never give up on each other.

The action and special effects in this film are grand. Showing different mutant powers is what made X-Men unique to begin with. Its not entirely combat action, like Avengers, its more letting their powers do the work. Magneto slowly lifts an entire baseball stadium, which allows us to marvel at how powerful mutants can be.

The story is astounding! This film has to pick-up from the previous films and tie-up loose ends. Not only do they succeed but, they also remember little details. Example: the young Wolverine doesnt have metal claws. Theyre bone because he doesnt get the metal ones until sometime in the future. Specifics like that add to how incredible this film is.
It can also confuse people who haven't seen the other films. There are inside jokes and character connections that could be lost.

My favorite character is Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant who has incredible speed.
This is by far the best representation of a comic-book character. Evan shows the mischievous and cocky side of Silver that is always a kick to watch.

My favorite scene is Quicksilvers super speed sequence. This is when the team breaks Eric/Magneto out of a Pentagon prison and the group is cornered by security. Quicksilver, without a care in the world, pranks the guards by poking the bullets in mid-air, pulling their guns out of their hands and more. This is such an incredible ride that it just needs to be experienced.

The message of this film is, Choices you make in the present, affect your future. The whole reason for this story is that one careless act has changed the world forever. We need to think through the choices we make to have a bright future.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 13- to 18 year-olds. This film shows dark images and language that is not intended for younger audiences.

6404242,4,B00K7IPH5I,"The X-Men as a franchise halted itself with the hasty X-MEN: THE LAST STAND for a number of reasons. Firstly and most importantly, it's just a god-awful film. Second, if Fox hadn't been so fiercely competitive with Bryan Singer in 2006 with the Warner Bros. release of SUPERMAN RETURNS, they might have kept Singer for the third chapter, allowing him to complete (or continue) his vision rather than allowing the hackery of Brett Ratner to invade the franchise. And a few susbsequent releases didn't help matters much either. With an extremely tepid pair of films like X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (it's a well-intentioned reboot, but it has none of the flavor of the Singer films), it seemed like the franchise was done for, like Fox does with just about everything it has (See: ALIEN, PREDATOR, DIE HARD, etc.). But then came THE WOLVERINE, which gave the franchise a much-needed shot in the arm, and announced that not only would they be bringing the beloved ""Days of Future Past"" storyline to the big screen, but that Singer was going to return to direct this outing; it was everything they needed to move back in the direction that the series was going in before THE LAST STAND. The good news is that it does. The not-so-good news is that the result doesn't reach the level of hype it's received.

In a dystopic present, a surviving group of X-Men, led by Professor X (reprised again by the great Patrick Stewart) as well as a ""reformed"" Magneto (reprised again by the great Ian McKellen) are fighting power-adaptive robotic mutant hunters called Sentinels. Returning also to the fray, with actors reprising their respective roles, are Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Storm (Halle Berry) and, naturally, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The Sentinels were brought to bear because of an incident at the Paris Peace Accord of 1973, when a young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence, reprised from FIRST CLASS) assassinated the Sentinel's creator, Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who believes that mutants represent a threat to homo sapiens in the same way homo sapiens eliminated the neaderthals and designed the Sentinels to be humanity's last resort. With new-found (and unexplained powers), Kitty is able to send Wolverine back to his younger body in the past, at the urging of Xavier and Magneto, to find and stop Mystique, but he must also enlist their younger selves as well. Wolverine wakes up in the weeks leading up to the Peace Accord to find the younger Xavier (James McAvoy, also reprising from XM:FC) as an alcohol-addled self-centered jerk who has depowered his psychic abilities in order to have the ability to walk, thanks to a serum Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult, also reprising from XM:FC) created, that also allows him to maintain his less ""beastly"" appearance. But Erik (Michael Fassbender, ALSO reprising from XM:FC) has been in a prison several stories below the Pentagon since 1963, where he's believed to be the assassin of JFK, and they need to get him out, leading them to enlist young speedster Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters). Meanwhile, Mystique is still on her mission, gathering what she needs to kill Trask, and the clock is ticking on that, as well as the present, where Kitty is struggling to maintain Wolverine's link to his past self. If he doesn't succeed, the mutant population will effectively end, and if he does, who knows what will happen?

Again, Singer gives this film the energy and excitement and humor and the drama that was lost when he left (and if you're looking for evidence of energy, excitement and humor in one scene, look no further than the absolutely bravura prison break scene, which is easily the centerpiece of this film). Writer Simon Kinberg, whose career runs hot and cold and was at least partially responsible for the abysmal failure that was X-MEN 3, gets his mojo back here, and gives the audience some good dialogue and smart storytelling. From a performance angle, pretty much everyone is aces in this gigantic cast, even if they're somewhat hamstrung by not having a lot to do. As always, even in the worst films, Jackman shines and proudly wears the character of Logan, reminding me again of the idiocy of all the nay-sayer fanboys that originally attacked his casting. McAvoy is much better here than in FIRST CLASS, but has most of the dramatic heavy lifting. Lawrence continues a string of really excellent performances as Raven/Mystique, who digs deep for more than just surface in a role that could have easily been just that. Fassbender has far less screentime here than in FC, but he REALLY makes it count. Evan Peters as Peter/Quicksilver really shines here with his first major big-screen outing after his terrific work in the three seasons on AMERICAN HORROR STORY. Dinklage doesn't get to get to do too much here, and isn't really the villain of the piece, but more of a plot point that he manages to still give three-dimensional life to. The rest of the returning cast with only really one exception is pretty much on-point with what they've done in the past films, and sadly, that exception is McKellen as the elder Magneto. He seems... just kind of sleepy, which is sad for a performer who has given so much over the course of these films.

My main problem with DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is that it lacks the gravity of Singer's previous outings because, frankly, the film is extremely cluttered. There are so many different characters the film introduces that very few of them, other than the obvious stars, are really shafted. Sure there's Toad, Havok, Bishop, Blink, Warpath, Sunspot and even a few I didn't recognize, but most of them are relegated to one line or less and maybe about three to four minutes of screentime if they're lucky. This is where X2 succeeded, was by giving each of the returning cast members, as well as the new ones, the time to develop, whereas here, they're little more than easter eggs for X-Men fans, which also brings me to the post-credits sequence, which I won't spoil, but if you're not a fan of the comics or the cartoons, you won't have any clue what's happening. I know that post-credits sequences are the new gimmick, particularly for comic-book and superhero films, but this is one thing that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gotten right for the most part: Don't make it just for the fans, because the rest of the audience has nothing to get excited about without getting several minutes of explanation.

Possibly the most lasting thing to come out of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, without spoiling anything, is that it does completely erase the events of X3, which is a pretty awesome thing.

Ultimately, DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is a very good piece of summer blockbuster entertainment that might improve on subsequent viewings, and it hits all the notes it needs to, even if it might leave you longing for more.",1401321600,5,6872,4.855072463768116
6404243,5,B00K7IPH5I,"Finally, they figured out how to make one of these. The movie thankfully forgoes the endless origins and expositions that plague so many comic book movies, and the movie simply jumps right into a wild ride of a story. There is a superb balance of crazy action, gritty characters and suspenseful scenes with a plot that really moves along nicely. A wide cast of mutants all get fair shares of screen time in this epic war across time. The evil robots are wonderfully designed killers that stalk the mutants with vicious intensity.

There are some noticeable defects: The beginning half is far better than the back end, another dearth of mutant vs mutant action, some strange plot points that don't make sense upon deeper review. But the good parts easily overwhelm the bad ones with several unforgettable scenes.

Most importantly, the time-travel plot wipes away all the stupid continuity of the previous films. Like the plot of this film, the franchise has hopefully fixed the future for the better this time.",1401321600,35,1010,4.900584795321637

personally I think Mystique just got WAYYYYYYYY too much screen time.just cause the actress is very right popular now.

Logan & Magneto & Xavier were just on the sidelines.

yes this clears up some continuity from previous X movies but as in any franchise, it creates entire new plot holes & unexplained things.

Magneto. BEST ACTING IN THE MOVIE.
Xavier was really good.
Logan was HUGE idk what he eats fffffff but what a beast...with nothing to fight.
I liked Mystique despite having too much screen time.
that one new mutant *i won't say name* STOLE THE MOVIE* in his 10 minutes & then you don't see him again like that.
what a waste

the music was ok. nothing memorable

Nolan (Batman Trilogy) & Whedon (Avengers) & Snyder (Watchmen) are still the BEST in superhero movies.
Singer isn't on their level. he seems confused about Xmen comics.

i think there was just too much talking & espionage going on.
lot of repeated lines. like 10x you will hear same thing back & forth.

movie wasn't written well.
 I give it a 7. watchable but a letdown cause it could've been great.",1401235200,11,1235,4.433628318584071
6404245,3,B00K7IPH5I,"How harsh I am on this movie depends on how I approach it.
It's as good as 'X2:X-Men United', which until now has been the 2nd best in the series....so there's that.
If the series were its own thing, and not based on X-Men, I'd say it was a fairly good sci-fi/actiony type movie. Not great. just decent.
BUT, knowing the X-Men, and knowing what Marvel Studios has proven can be done with a Marvel movie 9 times now....Fox's X-Men series falls waaaaaaaaaaaay short of the mark, and this movie is no different.
The entire X-Men movie series makes me kinda depressed knowing the VAST potential for what X-Men movies COULD be, and knowing that that potential is totally wasted.

-

- X-M:DoFP is competent as a story.
- X-M:DoFP, like the movies that started the series, is muted and hasn't learned to embrace the energy and liveliness of its comicbook source. It's still the same overly sullen/dour thing as the originals...with two exceptions*.
- X-M:DoFP had ONE scene that was truly fantastic*.
- X-M:DoFP has a LOT of plot holes (although nowhere near as bad as The Amazing Spider-Man 2's) -
--- Magneto is INSANELY powerful, and the amount of metal within his range at any given time is more than enough for him to rampage, even when they claim it's not.
--- The entire plot of the movie happens only because the X-Men of the future are apparently SUPER uncreative in their approach to solving the problem.
--- Kitty can suddenly make peoples' minds time travel. What? When did that happen? Why? How? Can we maybe address that? Lampshade it at least?
--- There are a great many other plot holes.

But they are fairly ""minor"" plot holes, in the sense that many are essentially mandatory for the movie to happen at all, and some you only notice if you pay real attention to the timelines between all the movies. Nothing like the incoherent mess of plot holes that is The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

-

*The two exceptions to the sullen/dour, energy/vibrance-lacking-ness of X-M:DoFP are Quicksilver and Blink.
- Quicksilver is hilarious. Quicksilver is awesome. Quicksilver is the best thing about this movie. Quicksilver is barely in the movie. The movie needs about 1000% more Quicksilver. And, to his credit, his costume looks completely idiotic, but he absolutely makes it work....somehow.
He also gets the movie's ONE fantastic scene, which is the best thing in the movie....and then they send him home. Probably because he's completely OP (just like his dad), and they didn't know how to write a plot around both Magneto AND Quicksilver.
I truly DID NOT expect Fox's version of Quicksilver to turn out well AT ALL, given the terrible costume they gave him. Very pleasantly surprised.
- Blink is colorful, clever, and a complete badass. She's actually flashy and creative enough to come off as a comic book character(and I mean that in the best way possible).
A team of ice guy (Ice Man), metal guy(Colossus), and fire guy(Sun Spot) is kinda boring when they're all wearing the same bland black leather and not talking.
But the anime girl with purple hair, crazy green eyes, anime face markings, and the ability to fling bright purple energy portals around like an anthropomorphic ASHPD?....she's awesome, even if she doesn't really get any lines. She makes her whole team fight like badasses and constantly saves their asses. This movie also needs about 1000% more Blink.

-

In the end, this movie actually had a specific job it had to do - reboot the series. It had to mostly wipe out the canon of all the movies that came before it (except First Class), and reset the X-Men universe to a fresh slate.
To that end, mission clumsily mostly accomplished....if you don't think about it very long.

-

Sooooo......it's.....okay.
It's been like 13 years, or whatever since the first X-Men movie came out, and there have been HUGE evolutions in this genre of movies, but this series is still stuck in 2001 mode.
Kinda ironic that this series about mutants and evolution refuses to evolve...but that means if you like First Class and X1/X2, you'll like this.

-

Notes:
- They managed to make Bishop not really matter...at all....in Days Of Future Past.
Bishop's whole shtick was that he was traveling through time to save the future. This movie is all about time traveling to save the future. His entire role could've been glossed over and the movie would've been totally unphased.
WTF? Why bother including him at all then?
- Mystique is utterly central to the plot....but Jennifer Lawrence the actress is utterly irrelevant to the movie.
Her part could've almost been played by any girl who can pull off the Mystique body paint - despite her showing up all over the place, that's how little time she gets to actually speak and act. HUGE step down from her actually being a significant character in First Class.
Weirdly kinda seems almost like a waste of her being part of the cast...
- There are a weird number of major characters in this movie who are just props. They just show up to stand around and fight stuff, and rarely say a thing. In fact, that's basically all of the ""future"" characters, aside from Xavier, Magneto and Wolverine.
- For as terrible as X-Men 3 was, it and First Class are the two movies in the series that did the most to bring energy, crazy spectacle, and levity to the series. They do deserve credit for that, because those are things that Brian Singer's X-Men movies are miserably devoid of.
- The Wolverine is still the best ""X-Men"" movie - mostly because it's not an X-Men movie (insofar as it's free of most of the series' tropes and baggage), because it embraces being all about Wolverine (which is what all these movies naturally seem to be best at anyways), and because it lets a single established(no need for an origin story) character be explored in a new and interesting setting(can we have more Japan?).

I used to be a HUGE fan of the X-Men, but these movies have sucked all the joy out of them, and nowadays it's really hard to care.

6404250,4,B00K7IPH5I,"There are times when a movie fails to work for me because it's an adaptation that fails to actually adapt the source material. However, the source material for this movie has become so broad that you can't accuse it of not being faithful to it because you just can't tell what it's trying to be faithful to in regards to said source material. No, my problem with the movie is that it fails to be faithful just to the Fox X-Men franchise and, really, there's not so much there that it's impossible to do.
But more on that in a minute.

Yes, there will be spoilers. Consider yourselves warned.

As a movie, X-Men: Days of Future Past is fine if somewhat (a lot) predictable. The opening fight against the sentinels is fantastic. Well, except for the part where Kitty Pryde can send people into the past. What the heck? The powers of Kitty have long been established, not just within the comics but within the Fox X-Men universe, so giving Kitty the ability to send people consciously back in time seems a bit gratuitous. If they wanted a mutant to do that, why not just put in a mutant to do that rather than give that power to someone who shouldn't have it? Or, you know, include Forge in the lineup, because he would have made a nice addition to the movie.

The other main issue I had with the movie was Xavier's struggle with what amounted to drug addiction. That whole thing felt easy and contrived and, while I get that they needed to present Wolverine with some obstacles to overcome to complete his mission, that one felt gratuitous. The idea that Xavier would sacrifice his mutant ability so that he could walk again and pretend to forget his pain was too far outside of the character we know to really be believable. At least, that's true coming at it from the standpoint of the comics. Maybe, it's plausible looking at it from just the movies, but I'm not feeling it that way, either.

But, really, the movie is fine. Well, except for the appearance of Quicksilver, which was completely out of context. We get Quicksilver but not the Scarlet Witch nor even any mention of her. Also, there was no acknowledgement that Quicksilver is Magneto's son and only even a very vague possibility of that even being true in the movie. So why use the character if you're not actually going to use the character? Just make that some other character that only exists in the movie universe. Honestly, it felt more like a jab at Disney and Marvel Studios who have Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch lined up for the next Avengers movie.

However, the scene where he saves everyone in the kitchen is fantastic.

But, really, the movie is fine. It is. It's enjoyable. The cast is great. Of course, Jackman carries the film. His performance of Wolverine continues to be flawless. And Jennifer Lawrence was so much better in this one than she was in First Class. I continue to like Shawn Ashmore as Bobby Drake, and I really wanted to see more of Bishop and Blink, and I don't mean more of them in combat. It would have been nice to see them as characters, too.

All of that said, the thing that disturbed my enjoyment the most was the feeling that the whole movie was an excuse for Bryan Singer to fix all the problems he caused when he dropped out of X-Men 3 to go off and make that horrible Superman movie. So let's look at that a moment:
Singer had a plan for X-Men at the time. No one really knows what that plan was because he didn't share much of it and I kind of doubt he even knows, now, what he was doing then. But, in the middle of pre-production for X-Men 3, not only does he go off to make Superman, but he convinces James Marsden (Cyclops) to go with him (and some of his writers from the previous X-Men movies). Understandably, Fox gets pissed at both of them and vows that neither will ever work with them again and, just to prove their point, kills Cyclops off during the opening sequence of The Last Stand.

From there, a bunch of stuff happened in X3 and the other X-Men related movies that Singer wouldn't have done but, you know, he wasn't there. Fox and Singer make up; Singer returns to X-Men; Singer wants his characters back, those characters being Cyclops and Jean Grey. Basically, Days of Future Past is a story that creates a brand new X-Men world and allows Singer to ignore all previous X-Men continuity. He gets to bring back Cyclops and Jean and do whatever he wants from this point on. Until he decides to, again, abandon Fox's X-Men and leave someone else to try to figure out what he was doing. The whole thing lessens my enjoyment of Days of Future Past, which may not be fair to the actual movie, but Singer bothers me enough that I can't just ignore it.

In the final analysis, if you've liked the X-Men movies, there's no good reason that you won't like this one. Probably, it's one of the top three out of the, what?, seven movies. I think my count there is correct. As a series of movies, the X-Men movies still fail to approach what Marvel has been doing over at Disney but, as a single movie, this one is probably on par with the Iron Man sequels. It's good; it's just not awesome.",1401062400,2,5110,4.427659574468085
6404251,4,B00K7IPH5I,"When Bryan Singer left the X-Men franchise behind to tackle Superman in 2006, Brett Ratner stepped in for X-Men: Last Stand and delivered a shot to the gut of the franchise. Not only did he crowd the movie with numerous 'who the heck is that' mutants, finished the movie off with a silly, restrained and hokey battle and rushed through the X-Men comic book story-lines in two hours, but he delivered a real knockout blow by killing off characters that left fans stunned; and not in a good way.

Following Last Stand, the X-Men franchise came with three more movies; two Wolverine solo movies and X-Men: First Class, which meant to go back to the beginning and somehow get things back in line. All the other superhero franchises were thriving at the box office, why not X-Men? Singer, with Days of Future Past, has completed the task with some skillful writing, some head scratcher moments, some coincidental moments and a large dose of 'bare with us folks'.

As is the case with many superhero movies these days, in order to get somewhere, you have to endure much of that 'bare with us folks' and Days of Future Past is no exception. Not only is the entire movie obviously a setup for future films and a successful attempt to right the wrongs of previous films, but the opening sequence is so delicious, it leaves you hungry for what could be coming and never does. There is much to be corrected in the X-Men universe and after a slam-bam beginning that had me hungrily on the edge of my seat, the movie slowed to a series of talking head scenes. Sure they are talking heads with interesting powers, but the action became sparse; not non-existent, just sparse.

Fortunately the writing for Days of Future Past is extremely interesting and the story moves with a lot of creativity. The dialogue is frequently witty and the drama is effective. Wolverine's mind is sent back in time in order to prevent a catastrophe. He's the only one that can survive the trip. You would think that Wolverine was the only X-Men character that anybody actually cared about. Nobody else has received solo movies and he's received two; three if you count that he's the main star of this one as well. Personally, I was always a Cyclops fan, but they killed him off in the aforementioned Last Stand.

Despite being teased into thinking we would be watching a movie like the first five minutes and not, Days of Future Past is a well crafted and successful juggling of many elements. Thanks to this 'bare with us' film, the X-Men universe should live to see another day. It certainly wasn't the movie I thought it was going to be and some of the character decisions and plot motivations were a little sketchy, but sometimes you have to wade through thick mud to restore order, even in the fictional world.",1401062400,3,2780,4.632860040567952
6404252,4,B00K7IPH5I,"Fourteen years have gone by since Bryan Singer brought Marvel's most socially aware comic, X-men, to the big screen. In that time the franchise has had its meteoric ups, such as the brilliant X2: X-men United, and disastrous lows when Singer handed the reins over to Brett Ratner for X-men: The Last Stand. A terrible Wolverine solo film followed, but basically the X-men weren't reborn until X-men: First Class injected a little bit of Cold War-era espionage into what was a remarkable prequel. The genius of that film was how different it was from the comic book norm, in terms of style and scope, and the challenge of Singer's X-men: Days of Future Past is maintaining that while makings things even bigger.

Well, it's actually one of many challenges Singer faced. Chris Claremont's seminal comics story serves as the basis for the film which combines the super-sized casts of 'First Class' and the original trilogy. Normally a roster that size would get jumbled and unwieldy but Singer, along with screenwriter Simon Kinberg, deftly split the narrative between time periods. In the not-so far flung future, Xavier (a returning Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) are fighting a losing battle in a war against the robotic Sentinels, mutant hunters who have wiped out practically all life on Earth. Fans will geek at the presence of popular X-men like Blink (Fan Bingbing), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Warpath (Boo Boo Stewart), along with a couple of other familiar faces like Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). The impressive opening battle, anchored by Blink's brilliantly executed teleportation powers, takes a dire turn for the X-men and they are forced to make a bold decision.

""So many battles waged over the years, and yet none of them like this, are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change who we are, and unite, is the future truly set?""

Xavier's question is at the heart of everything this film sets out to be. Can Xavier and his mutant colleagues change the course of history and save the world from this terrible fate? Their plan may seem convoluted on the surface, but Kinberg explains it with simplistic ease. Hugh Jackman, looking more ripped than ever, returns as the loner X-man, Wolverine. The ideological war between Xavier and Magneto may give the film its brains, but Wolverine is the heart and soul. He's chosen to send his consciousness back in time to the 1973, when he'll find the younger Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) at odds after the events of the last movie. Only the two of them can stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from committing an act of violence that will trigger the dystopian future, but of course it proves to be easier than done.

The Charles Xavier Wolverine knows in the future is a far cry from the man he was before; a broken down shell addicted to a drug perfected by his lone remaining friend, Hank ""Beast"" McCoy (Nicholas Hoult). The drug lets Charles walk again, but it also has sapped away his telepathic powers. Those abilities are what gave Charles his ability to understand others, to feel their pain and use it as motivation, and without them he is lost. On the other end of the spectrum is Magneto, locked away in a specially-made cell cleverly tucked inside the Pentagon. After some fisticuffs, a little soul searching, and Wolverine's friendly urging ""You and I are going to be great friends someday"", Charles and Hank are convinced to join in on a prison break.

Singer, whose last two movies were the wretched Jack the Giant Slayer and mediocre Superman Returns, is clearly rejuvenated by his return to the X-men. And so we see him glorifying in the visual effects more than he ever has before. The best example comes with the introduction of Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the speedster mutant who will also be seen in Joss Whedon's Avengers: Age of Ultron played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. What was once perceived as a throwaway character written in as a slight to Whedon's use of him turns out to be the film's great showstopper, zipping past bullets with ease while everybody around him is perceived as standing still. It's as good a use of the character as one could have hoped for and puts a real burden on Whedon to find a way to top it. Frankly, I'm not so sure he can.

What's most impressive is how Singer keeps things personal while relishing in the spectacle. The love triangle between the angry Magneto, confused Mystique, and wounded Charles is very much in place and moves forward without a hitch. The plight of mutants has always been an allegory for minority rights and that has been taken even more to the forefront with these last two movies, along with a nifty anti-war statement thrown in for good measure. The X-men have some of the best villains in comics and Peter Dinklage is phenomenal as the Mengele-esque Bolivar Trask, the creator of the dangerous Sentinel program. While he doesn't say much, his impassive nature shows just how cruel he truly is as he sets out on a course of mutant capture and experimentation. Other important characters are introduced, written off, and teased in ways that deepen the franchise's past and future. Trust me in that you'll want to walk into it as cold as possible, but by the time the credits roll you'll be dying to see what comes next and to relive what came before.

With an eye towards revising the past, the '70s elements are wildly unpredictable yet authentic where it counts. The period aesthetic is perhaps even more refined than before, necessary as the time period becomes such an integral facet of the story. Everything from the Vietnam War to the JFK assassination are given a revisionist slant, with the only thing sticking out like a sore thumb is Singer's version of Richard Nixon who looks oddly like New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. Coincidence? Probably not. In that spirit of revision, X-men: Days of Future Past plays fast and loose with the franchise's continuity in a brilliant deck-clearing move that will have fans howling with joy.  Between this and 'First Class', 20th Century Fox are providing the most thoughtful and exciting comic book movies we've seen since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy. X-men: Days of Future Past deserves to be mentioned as one of the best superhero movies films ever made, and if you're a fan of Marvel's merry mutants, it may just be THE best.",1400976000,2,6392,4.820419325432999
6404253,5,B00K7IPH5I,"(Note: I will eventually update/replace this with a Blu-ray review when I eventually acquire the product).

So I might have mentioned this in past reviews, but I spent a good deal of my childhood pretty much worshiping the X-Men franchise: I read a few of the comics (till I got tired of the issues piling up), I watched the animated series religiously, practically bought every action figure I could find, and played any and all video games they ever came out with. Of course, that was purely from an amazement of the art and concept of ""cool-looking characters with superpowers."" But by the time I was older and a little more mentally mature, Bryan Singer would, then, start a film franchise that would change my perspective on the world of X-Men forever. It wasn't just about ""powers,"" anymore, but also philosophy.

And who better an actor to represent a philosopher than the great Patrick Stewart, playing an older Charles Xavier (basically a telepathic Capt. Pichard in a wheelchair), with another powerhouse actor opposite him via Ian McKellen (long before most people came to know him as Gandalf). Long story short: although the story and character elements weren't quite as close to the canon as they could've been, the big draw for me, personally, were the ideologies. In a world where humans are evolving through genetic mutation, how would this effect co-existence between humans and mutants, or could it even be achieved at all? What of all the questions, fear, and possible intent of wrong-doing based on this revelation?

The result of Singer's first 2 films really brought those quandaries into light and built up some great concepts.. until he left the 3rd one, and the whole franchise turned to crap. Like I said, I've always found Hollywood X-Men to be more about the contrasting views of Xavier and Lensherr than anything else: X1 established that world and set a tone for ""war,"" while X2 escalated things to an even grander, more epic scale. Unfortunately, I feel X3 lost that philosophical edge and basically turned the franchise into something completely superficial (that ""cool-looking characters with superpowers"" thing I mentioned, only sprinkled with some really bad/cheesy one-liners; eff you for that, Brett Ratner).

Thankfully, though, after that debacle and a less-than-stellar ""Wolverine Origins"" movie, Singer came back as writer with Matthew Vaughn directing to give us ""First Class."" And while it was a prequel that only added to the chagrin of hardcore fans and their continuity problems; for me, it was a fascinating re-introduction to the building blocks that were Charles' and Erik's philosophies. In addition, I also feel it added a lot of character depth giving a great glimpse of what makes each of them tick. One, driven by a calm, explorative, almost naive, sense of hope; the other, indoctrinated through fear, hatred, and misfortune; but both with similar goals: peace/freedom for mutant-kind.

When I heard Singer was returning to direct ""Days of Future Past"" and including the plot element of time travel to fix things (mainly X3), I was excited, to say the least. And with that said, boy did he fix 'em! DoFP essentially resets everything prior to this film, except FC, creating a new continuity and setting up all kinds of possible scenarios for future films. Not only that, though, but the balancing act between its past and present timelines do wonders for even more character-building, particularly in re-establishing Charles' faith in the prospect of humans and mutants someday co-existing with one another. I won't say much else as to not spoil things, but that was my main take and most enjoyable aspect from the film, by far.

On another note, I also wanted to make a few technical comments. I know most people rant that 3D is merely a ""gimmick,"" but I personally believe it can be well-utilized as a sort of aesthetic in and of itself. DoFP was shot in 3D, so I went and saw it as such. In terms of presentation, I would say it's not the most overt 3D (like ""Avatar""-level), but it's subtle and still pretty immersive, overall (more like ""Prometheus""), with a few action sequences that *really* take advantage of 3D's depth perception (the biggest and best one involving Quicksilver). If you can and have appreciated 3D and its general applicability, I would ""make it so.""

I wish I could say so much more, but I don't believe in spoiling things, and I don't think most people have the patience for large bodies of text, so let me simply say that I absolutely love the direction these films have gone in (aside from X3 and Origins, but none of that matters, anymore, thanks to good ole time traveling!). This shouldn't be too big a spoiler since it's already been announced as the next film, but get ready for Apocalypse, the greatest, grandest, and most powerful of all villains the X-Men have faced, akin to the likes of Thanos, Darkseid, and whatever other uber-powerful comic book villain you can think of. And yes, stay after the credits to get a quick sneak peek.

Overall rating: an obvious 10/10.",1400976000,30,5063,4.906542056074766
6404254,5,B00K7IPH5I,"X-Men movies have always been divisive.  There's people who, as fans of the source material, consider the changes they do bad.  There's fans of the source material who consider the things they correctly adapt to be the most important ones.  And, of course, between non comic readers there's a bunch of people who find the movies too unrealistic, and there are those who think they're very good fantasy/sci-fi films.  Consider me a member of the second of those four groups.  I am a fan of the source material, and I think the movies (mostly) follow the spirit of the comic books very well, so I don't care if some characters meet in different order, or if the suits they wear are not accurate.

The previous film in the franchise, X-Men: First Class seemed to be the film that made most people agree in its quality, the most appreciated along them until now.  This, Days of Future Past, is the film set out to join most of those groups.  Most, you can't just change the minds of those who care about a film being unrealistic.  Suffice to say, if you are unable to have some suspension of disbelief, you're going to miss a lot of great stories.

X-Men DOFP finally manages to perfectly unite both previous continuities (ignoring X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which has been set out of canon), getting rid of plot holes and correcting mistakes made in the previous films (particularly, X-Men 3), and ends the franchise with beautiful closure while still leaving things open for several more stories.

In the 80's, Marvel published a to-be classic two-issue X-Men comic titled ""Days of Future Past"".  Its basic story was that in a dystopian future, giant robots called Sentinels built to contain mutants reached the peak of their programming and decided the only way to control the mutant population would be to destroy or enslave what's left of humankind (the film Terminator would be released a few years later, probably inspired by this comic).  Desperate, the few X-Men left send Kitty Pryde's conscience into her own body in the past, so she can avoid the one murder that precipitates the mutant hate and kickstarts the building of sentinels.  Kitty was chosen because at that point in the past she's the only one in the group who didn't have training to avoid psychic attacks.

This films loosely adapts that story.  The basics and spirit are the same, but the events are different for two reasons: one, the story in the comics is too short to be adapted into a film without making several changes and two, the murder occurring in the comics is that of Senator Kelly, and that part was adapted into the first X-Men film.  The person murdered changes to Bolivar Trask (the creator of the Sentinels), and the person whose conscience is sent into the past is Wolverine, due to being the only one who can physically resist the trip.  Both changes are well thought and make sense.

Once Wolverine reaches the past, though, things are not so simple.  Professor Xavier has sunk into depression, many of the mutants of the previous film were captured and killed by Trask and Magneto ended up in prison for assassinating the president.  Luckily, Wolverine has a few aces in the hole.

The story is wonderfully written, but the plot is character driven, which makes the film more appealing, since these are great characters.  The relationships between Xavier, Magneto and Mystique take central place and are masterfully written.  And except for a couple of mutants who are basically glorified cameos, most of the other characters get their own fair share of characterization and screen time.

The action scenes are fantastic.  The survival battles in the dark future are desperate, fast and frightening.  The fights in the past are stylish and huge.  But the best scene in the film is probably Magneto's breakout from jail, courtesy of Quicksilver.  Quicksilver got a lot of hate from fans before the film's release due to his kinda ridiculous looks, but not only it works perfectly fine on film, his entire screen time, specially the part where he helps Magneto and the gang escape from the Pentagon is wonderfully done.  Take note, Flash writers: THIS is how you do a speedster.  It's the first time on live action in which filmmakers portray perfectly a speedster's powers.

This is one film everyone should find attractive, though I have to mention, there are a couple of scenes that I think children might find more than a little scary.  In fights set in the bleak future, you see a bunch of X-Men killed, impaled, decapitated and torn apart.  There's no blood or gore, because they have this happen to characters that are not in human mode (like Iceman), but it still involves characters being killed in very graphical fashion.  This will not traumatize anyone, but if you have a child who's a little sensitive, you might consider this.

Anyway, this movie is wonderful, bringing to light everything that's loved about X-Men and sci-fi, while setting the future for great things to come.  Stand all the way after the credits for a scene that sets up the sequel, Age of Apocalypse.  And go instructing yourself on this character, because he will play a major role in that film (considering his name is on the title, it should be obvious).  I will update this review once the film is released on Blu Ray, to consider the extras and such.",1400976000,8,5330,4.777292576419214
6404255,3,B00K7IPH5I,"Nine Things about the Movie ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (USA, 2014)

1. This is the most ambitious X-Men movie so far. And and while I liked it, it has the most problems of any X-Men movie so far.

2. It starts in the future, where all the mutants are being killed by giant robots called Sentinels. As a desperate last attempt at survival, they decide to send Wolverine's mind back in time 50 years to his younger self in order to stop Mystique from assassinating a scientist, which results in the creation of the Sentinels.

3. In order to stop the assassination, Wolverine (who, for some reason, does not look 50 years younger) must bring together Professor X and Magneto so they can find Mystique and do an intervention. They pick up a few other young mutants along the way.

4. The plot of the movie is basically a science fiction soap opera. While it fleshes out some of the X-Men universe nicely, the characters make nonsense decisions in order to needlessly stretch out the drama. And I can think of about a dozen other ways they could have stopped the creation of the Sentinels other than their half-baked ""talk Mystique out of it"" plan..

5. The action scenes are well-done and exciting, as are the special effects. While the X-Men characters are impossible and wildly unbalanced (I feel bad for the guy with the frog tongue), it's fun to watch them.

6. One problem with movie is that it's inconsistent - it breaks some of the rules that it sets up for itself, and mutants apparently develop new powers when they need to.

7. But the biggest problem with the movie is that it falls into the same trap that most time-travel movies do, especially when they are part of a series. Some scenes here should have happened in earlier movies, but they didn't. Some scenes in other movies shouldn't have happened, but they did. It's a continuity disaster.

8. The climax of the movie was so over-the-top and absurd that I just couldn't stop myself from rolling my eyes a few times.

9. This is not my favorite X-Men movie, but if you're a fan, it's worth seeing.",1400976000,5,2063,4.539083557951482
6404256,5,B00K7IPH5I,"Simply put, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie to date, and a strong contender for best comic book movie as well. DOFP tackles an iconic comic book and handles it exceedingly well. It's a daunting storyline, complicated with time travel, multiple casts and exceedingly high expectations, but director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg manage it fantastically.

MINOR SPOILERS BELOW

Days of Future Past begins in a desolate and dark future New York City. Some members of the cast from the original X-Men Trilogy are on the run from giant robot Sentinels. They meet up and decide to send Wolverine back in time 50 years to stop this war before it begins. A story like this could become convoluted and verbose quickly, but Kinberg manages to walk that fine line and deliver only a bit of exposition to quickly set the tone and plot.

The time travel aspect of the film does a few great things to the story and franchise. It creates tension, real purpose and ""corrects"" some mistakes from previous installments in the X-Men film franchise that until recently has been poorly managed. Ultimately, DOFP is packed full of excellent acting (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender shine yet again) and for once, an X-Men movie doesn't over use Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. As charismatic as Jackman is, it's easy to make him the focus of the film, and in a way he is, but really he's just the guy that moves the story along, giving way to focus on the supporting cast.

It is an ensemble movie and wouldn't work without sharing the screen. The relationships and interactions are what drive this movie along and make it so much fun. There's the right amount of humor and the best action in any X-Men movie to date. (The scenes with Quicksilver will be talked about for years and his spotlight scene is a demonstration of visual effects mastery.) Singer frames the fights in the future as if they're jumping right off the page. Kinberg and Singer realize that what makes X-Men fights so great is watching the mutants work as a team. This dynamic is very evident as all the fights in the past are one-on-one, the mutants haven't learned yet. It's a small detail, but one that makes it clear that over the course of those next 50 years, these characters are going to learn a lot.

The supporting elements of the film are top notch as well. The set design, costumes, visual and special effects; all combine to really offer a complete experience to the audience. It's clear that the vision of this film (and budget $200 million+) is grand. It's meant to be epic and succeeds in hitting all of it's goals. DOFP is ambitious, gutsy and fun. However, the most impressive element is the pacing. In a complicated story like this, with a huge budget and demand for impressive action scenes, Kinberg and Singer take the time for these characters to talk. There are slower moments that establish motivation, desire and understanding for the character's actions. We understand why Magneto feels the way he does, we know why Mystique is waking a dangerous path, why Bolivar Trask (the creator of the Sentinels and played perfectly by Peter Dinklage) is motivated by the ""mutant threat"" and why Xavier has lost his way.

In the end, Days of Future Past really stands out as a story driven movie that also happens to be about comic book characters. While you could argue that the past decade has been overwhelmed by the comic book movie genre, there are examples like this that demonstrate that while the comic book may be the source material, the end result is far better than just another comic book movie.",1400976000,7,3596,4.709062003179651

I think this movie is just as good as any of the Marvel/Disney movies that have come out. It was definitely better than Iron Man 3, The Thor movies, and just as good as Avengers.

Great acting from all the male leads; well executed story albeit not original. There are some good scenes like the ones with the flash guy and those between McAvoy and Fasbender.

The bad:
I can't remember a single spectacular action scene from this movie on par with the hanging missiles scene in the First Class.
McAvoy spent 2/3 of the movie weeping.
Every scene with Jennifer Lawrence or Halle Berry is completely, totally, lifeless.",1400889600,6,447,4.881578947368421
6404261,4,B00K7IPH5I,"If you're a X-Men movie fan, you want to see this one. This one has a nice mix of past and future events like the title suggests. You will see how bad the future got for mutants and what they need to do to save their future. You will see many new old and new mutants from the series. I liked how they did a very created way of sending a person back to the past to try to save their future. It's very different way of sending a person back then what I saw in the cartoon.

There's a quite of bit of action in this movie, but also mixed well with the dialogue. I loved how the movie did a good mix of putting action with dialogue. Many movies will try to do action scenes and then do their dialogues before or after that, but this movie will do it at the sometime. That way the audience won't be bored out of their mind hearing what just happened, and just continue the story from it.

I won't mind seeing this movie again, because there was a lot to absorb from it. I'll probably see something I missed, when I see it again. There is an extra bonus scene at the very end. You have to stay to till the very end of the credits to watch it. It's pretty good. It sets up the story for the next movie. It's not a very important scene to set up the next movie though, so you don't have to stay to watch it. But if you're a fan of these movies, you probably stay anyways.",1400889600,3,1363,3.9527272727272726
