7452104,5,B015TDBRSQ,Great blu-Ray set for any Royals fan!,1453507200,,37,4.428571428571429
7452105,4,B015TDBRSQ,"The quality of the video and sound is fine.  My only complaint is that they didn't include any of the pre-game and some post-game interviews were cut off in the middle.  I thought the ""Collectors Edition"" would have everything.  I wanted the complete experience...",1452211200,,264,4.954545454545454
7452106,4,B015TDBRSQ,"If your a Royals fan this is well worth the purchase. It is fun to watch this talented, cohesive,  and resilient group bring the championship back to Kansas City. The production quality left a lot to be desired. The transition time between innings was far too long. Some of the editing within the innings was noticeable. The whole production value seemed far more sloppy than in other recent World Series collections. The Fox announcers, per usual, are like a pack of amateurs living for the big glossy moment. Thankfully you can switch audio to the Royals or the Mets announcers for some real baseball knowledge and perspective. Overall, the set is a nice addition to my collection. It would have received 5 stars if not for the sloppy production. Look past it and buy it anyhow.",1451174400,7,780,4.735294117647059
7452107,5,B015TDBRSQ,"I don't know what the other poster was watching 9 (hes probably a Mets fan), but I got the Blu Ray's of this and the picture is WONDERFUL.  Better than it looked on tv to me.  I bypass Joe Buck and his gang and listen to Denny and Ryan from the radio broadcasts and the sound on it can't be beat.  With this Blu Ray, you'll get all 5 games of the Royals Magical march to their first World Series Championship in 30 years!  You'll also get ALDS game 5 against the Astros and ALCS Game 6 against the Blue Jays (I havn't re-watched this game yet but I remember when it was first on, it was so nerve wracking that I almost had a heart attack!  lol);

If you are a fan of the Kansas City Royals and were thrilled to watch them FINALLY win the World Series again, then this is the Blu-Ray/DVD set for you!  it was worth every penny I paid for it and much more.  It will get watched many many times in this household, just like my 1985 set!",1450656000,19,933,4.005405405405406
7452108,1,B015TDBRSQ,Terrible video's. If you expect to get narrative best of videos of the Royals march to a World Series victory you won't get it with this set. It's like some amateur at home taped the games and then ripped some specific plays. It's about as interesting as watching grass grow. The sound goes up and down during the video and the brightness goes light and dark. Save your money.,1450569600,4,376,4.463768115942029
7452109,5,B015TDBRSQ,"Video quality is exceptional! I am so glad I purchased this set. In addition to all 5 games in their entirety, you also get the f
complete final games of the Divisional Championship and the A.L. Championship. Bonus disc of season and post season highlights was very enjoyable to watch!
Those that complained about video quality obviously have something wrong with their systems.",1489017600,2,378,5.015873015873016

7452117,5,B015TDBRSQ,This is a wonderful recap of the 2015 World Series - what a wonderful last two years for KC Royals fans!  It was such a disappointed for the plaguing injuries in 2016 but at least we were able to win the All Star Game for the rest of the AL  :-)  Bring on 2017 and Go Royals!,1477612800,,275,3.789473684210526

7452119,5,B015TDBRSQ,"I absolutely loved this DVD set. If you can't see or make it too all of the games, this is a great way to catch up on everything you missed. Plus there are a lot of highlights and other things you might have missed.
Got it really fast and quality is great. Forever Royal!",1470873600,,271,4.037037037037037
7452120,1,B015TDBRSQ,Horrible quality. Im not 100 percent sure this is just not a knock off. Im so disappointed with the how the picture looks. My Dvr of the world series looks a lot better then this does. This is by no means true HD. I want a full refund!!!!!,1468713600,,239,4.0
7452121,5,B015TDBRSQ,Been a Royals fan since 1971 so I couldn't wait to hop on this.  Has every minute of the World Series and one disc has that exciting 8th inning of the 4th game of the divisional series down in Houston.,1467504000,,201,4.025

7452125,5,B015TDBRSQ,Delivered earlier than expected & in time for son's 8th birthday. You would've thought we bought him a new car as he opened it up!!! Excellent set - Go Royals!,1462147200,,159,4.333333333333333

7452128,5,B015TDBRSQ,"I was 7 years old when the Royals won in 1985 and remember watching the last few outs, never knew it would take so long to see it again. This dvd set really is an all inclusive  look into the 2015 world series, and a lot of other moments throughout the season. Perfect for a long tortured Royals fan.",1460678400,,300,4.084745762711864

7452132,5,B015TDBRSQ,"This is actually perfect for a true Royals fan! A lot of other videos only shows highlights & overviews. But this dvd collection shows EVERYTHING!
If you want to relive the moments - it's worth the money!! You won't regret it.",1458950400,3,226,4.536585365853658
7452133,5,B015TDBRSQ,"Great, great",1458691200,,12,5.5
7452134,5,B015TDBRSQ,"I wanted to wait to see if the definitive DVD of the Royals' amazing post-season run would come out.  The reviews I read didn't convince me that this was the right set, but having been a die hard Royals fan since 1975, I decided that I could survive blowing less than a $100 bucks.

Fortunately, this DVD set was exactly what I wanted.

You already know that you get the five World Series games, plus Game 5 of the ALDS and Game 6 of the ALCS.  The key game changer is the Bonus DVD, that includes important moments from the regular season, such as every walkoff win, Paulo Orlando's first ML hit (and Salvy faking like he's going to throw the ball in the stands), and Kendrys Morales' 15-base day (3 HR and a 3B).  It also includes -- and this was really important for me -- the highlights from the OTHER ALDS and ALCS wins.

The picture is great -- some people don't know how to adjust their displays.

Having Denny Mathews for PBP was a real treat, instead of the FOX crew (but you can listen to them if you want).  I haven't listened to the Mets radio crew getting their souls crushed, but I assume that's pretty satisfying.

This is the definitive DVD for my money.  I'm really psyched that I took the plunge.",1458691200,30,1214,4.308370044052864
7452135,5,B015TDBRSQ,"I've read some of the reviews here complaining about video quality and long pauses between inning. I can't figure these reviews out. There are a couple breaks between innings in game 1 of the WS, but I believe it is from when the broadcast went out. As far as video quality, it looks close to, if not the same as, when I watched it live in HD. Obviously, this is a must-have for any of us Royals fan that have been through all the struggles over the years. This is a piece of Kansas City history I will enjoy watching over and over again as the years go by. Hopefully it won't be so many years before I can buy another WS Championship DVD set.",1458000000,,643,4.152
7452136,3,B015TDBRSQ,Low quality transfer to disc with some odd cuts here and there. Not sure why they didn't include game 4 in Houston as well since that was probably the single most important game. But overall well worth it to see Alex hit that homerun in the 9th inning of Game 1.,1457913600,,262,4.1568627450980395
7452137,5,B015TDBRSQ,"Fantastic! All of the games, with the ability to listen to home and away radio broadcasts over the games as well. Royals fans can enjoy these glorious blu rays of the WS forever without hearing Joe Buck!",1457740800,,203,4.513513513513513
7452138,3,B015TDBRSQ,"Right away I got my copy to find large pieces of the case were broken, including parts of the hinge that holds all of the discs. Closing the case was fairly hard when I had to shift things inside around just right (since the hinge was broken). So I returned it and got a replacement. The replacement came and was also broken but not as badly as the last one so I'm not even going to bother with replacing it again. As long as the discs all work and the case doesn't crumble I'm happy.

The video, on the other hand, looks okay, and the audio has plenty of options. I personally like having the audience audio levels up quite high as I use the crowd to judge the reactions to plays and whatnot. The main Fox audio has the crowd audio just right but the Royals announcer audio seems too quiet, so much that it's like you are listening to a couple of people talking in a room with a tv playing in the background. So if you don't want to listen to Joe Buck and gang you might not like your other options.

Overall, great World Series run! Not the best executed Blu Ray release though.",1457568000,,1080,4.1875
7452139,5,B015TDBRSQ,I actually really do Love it! The Season highlight bonus was a GREAT plus!,1457049600,,74,4.357142857142857

7452142,5,B015TDBRSQ,"It took 30 years to happen again, but man were the last two years quite a fun ride. While the sum of the features and etc are not as good as previous years or with the 85 World Series I have on DVD, this is still a great catch for any Royals fan.",1456963200,,246,3.660377358490566

8734599,3,B015TDBRSQ,"I'm a huge Royals fan, but this collection is not very professionally edited. I was hoping that they'd include some of the pre-game show, the lineup introductions, etc but the videos of the games actually seem to start arbitrarily, game 1 starts with the announcer mid-sentence after the teams have already taken the field. The transition between innings is sometimes cut off as well.

They do include the ""post-game show"" by MLB Network but it too gets cut off about 3-4 mins in, while the broadcaster was mid-sentence. Why even include that option if you're only going to show the intro of the post game?

Additionally, the blu-ray is only in 720p - we should be well into 1080p territory at this point.

They do include radio broadcasts, which is great because Joe Buck is pretty awful.",1500163200,,789,4.744525547445256
