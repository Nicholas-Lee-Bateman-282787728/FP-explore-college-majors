6201170,2,B00HRUQ8YS,"I liked both Shout! and Barney Miller.
However, these discs have difficulty being read at all, with me needing to open and restart the DVD player or computer multiple times before the discs will play.
And telling my DVD player to [ALL REPEAT] plays the same [CHAPTER/Episode] over and over again.
I am guessing this is some bizarre form of copy protection, but it makes these discs less than ideal for watching.
i will have to rethink buying any more Shout! products.",1417132800,5,467,4.7073170731707314
