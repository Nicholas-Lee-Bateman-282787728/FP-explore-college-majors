6787672,4,B00P69WWOW,"I chose to buy this one primarily because all of the films in the set were ones I had previously enjoyed. They all have that 'spark' that is needed that moves us and interests enough to want to watch again.  For me, the biggest value is having a second chance to watch these movies on discs that have not been environmentally challenged:)  They are new discs without physical flaws and the prices for the ability to re-watch great actors is great.",1427846400,7,447,4.506172839506172
