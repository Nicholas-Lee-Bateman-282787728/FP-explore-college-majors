Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all.",1120694400,,466,4.131868131868132
