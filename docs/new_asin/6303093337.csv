7837025,5,6303093337,"The video opens up with the music video for Estranged, followed by interviews and documentary interspersed with music video clips and music. It really provides a look into Axl, his thought process and emotions, the band, the making of the videos (including Don't Cry and November Rain, the others in the trilogy), interviews with band members, crew members and others (including Del James). All in all, this provides an insightful, meaningful look into the band and gives you an appreciation for the songs (Estranged in particular) and their music videos.",1262304000,,555,5.177777777777778
7837026,5,6303093337,"I was able to locate 1 copy of video IV in the trilogy.  I must say that though I purchased this video over seas and had to have it transfered to DVD so that I could watch the video (the entire lot came out to about $110) I would do it agian. Without this video, there is no understanding the band, the songs, the albums or, and for me most importantly, Axl. With his description of what this song means to him and why exactly it is not the ""ending"" of Del James short story ""Without You"" I came to realize that it is part IV of a trilogy because though it is the third video in a set of three, it actually is part IV...Del James short story ""Without you"" is part III. The word fan does not do justice to the person who propelled by something else locate this video and watch it to understand the entire picture, then go one step further and begin looking for the book ""The Language of Fear"" by Del James (which is no longer in print) to read the story of Mayne and Elizabeth which inspired Axl Rose to write November Rain and Estranged...as well as inspired his soul to be who he is now. In short, money well spent.",1102118400,4,1116,4.1192660550458715
7837027,5,6303093337,"AXL writes another amazing song, and another Video with this Song. SLASH also puts his 2 cents with his incredible guitar solos, and the solo scenes in the Video. This Video has amazing special effects, and great scenes, and all come from the best band ever GUNS N ... ROSES!!!",1048723200,2,277,4.56
7837028,5,6303093337,"This is a great video into the making of Estranged.
I've had mine and adored it for about... 6 years now.
Contains the actual estranged video at the start, then it goes into 1 hour of the making.",1033084800,4,195,4.157894736842105
7837029,5,6303093337,"This is my favorite of the three ""Making Videos"" videos (But that probably has something to do with Estranged being my favorite GNR song). I think one of the best things about watching the videos is that you can get a good idea of what the band is like in real life (in person and not on stage). I liked what Gilby Clark had to say, and I found out for myself why Duff is called Duff!
The unusual thing about all these three videos is that they play GNR songs quietly in the background, sometimes they're demos or songs that you might not have heard before.
I had to buy a special NTSC compatible VCR to watch this video, because where I live the format is PAL. I still think it was worth it. The bottom line is that if you love the song, then you'll have to buy the video.",1023235200,5,773,4.092105263157895
7837030,5,6303093337,"This video is EXCELLENT!!!
Axl is Down-to-Earth, REAL and Honest & just totally amazing through out the entire video!  You can really see the sincerity
in his face when talking about his past relationships and family and how hurt he truely was, especially at the hands of Stephanie & how baddly he hurt and felt over her son Dylan!
Thanks Axl!

7837031,5,6303093337,"I've had a chance to see, ""Making, part IV"". I think this video was the hardest for GNR to make, as there were scenes in the ocean.  I enjoyed seeing the band work with the dolphins and I was amazed that the  part where Axl swims with the dolphins took place in a wave pool! If you  enjoy learning how a video is made, then you will enjoy this one.  I also  liked that GNR closed off one of Hollywood's busiest streets to make this  video!",953769600,6,439,4.046511627906977
