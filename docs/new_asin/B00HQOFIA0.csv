6197846,5,B00HQOFIA0,"I am reader of the Vampire Academy series (but its been awhile). I saw the movie with some friends who never read about the books. My two friends were skeptical about enjoying the movie, but willing to go. Personally, I was anxious about how well it was done. At the end of the movie, my friends' opinions changed. My friends loved the movie. I was more than happy that I chose to go on the release night.

Don't expect my review to be perfect, but I am trying:  I believe the movie was a good adaption of the book. For book readers, remember it is an adaption from book to movie, which are not the exact same types of media. Some scenes or the plot line order (such as ""explaining"" the character types/powers) are slightly different on the movie screen vs in the book. Like all book-to-movies, some things were cut out the film that are in the book, but a movie shouldn't be 3+ hours long. I think they made good choices on the actors/actresses and they match the character descriptions. The movie definitely maintained the Vampire Academy portrayal. Overall, the movie has kept up with the reputation of the book- great and/or excellent!!!

For people who have NOT read the series:  The beginning of the movie may be confusing, but it gets clarified. Don't walk out of the movie within the first 15 minutes. The first few opening scenes will seem strange, and misguide you into thinking it's some kind of YA thriller movie. Buts its how the author wrote the book. After that, it keeps to the environment/style that its trying to portray.

As for categorizing the movie: Its definitely a young adult movie. It has action, comedy, sci-fi/fantasy, and drama ALL in one. Many people think any YA vampire movie is ""just another Twilight movie"" [Twilight= YA fantasy drama movie]. No, the Vampire Academy is NOT another Twilight. The movie feels more down to earth- its easier to relate to. For the most part, the vampires are not your stereotypical vampire, especially in references the vampires who are the main characters. There is 2 types of vampires, plus half human/half vampires. I'm not going any further into vampire descriptions because that may be spoiler for some people.

The Vampire Academy actually puts the characters into a high school environment (fantasy style), but with some parts you wouldn't put in a high school, such as a temporary-hold prison and combat training. It deals friendships/bonding, and high school clichs, yet still includes rule breaking, rivalry, and comedy. The plot line deals with the more advanced good/evil plot that also includes adults, some comedy, action and certain issues/problems (which is the basis of books). Both the HS setting and good/evil plot have some drama, but as said, comedy is included too! [Once again, I'd go into detail, but then I'd be revealing the story with many movie spoilers.] Overall, I think the movie is great mix.",1391817600,94,2888,4.800804828973843
6197847,4,B00HQOFIA0,"Last week I went to see the latest Jack Ryan movie and one of the previews was...Vampire Academy! While my sister and I were doing this ridiculous fist bump routine a man down the aisle said (loudly), ""I have no interest in seeing that."" Ha! You missed out cranky old man because I loved it!

Right off the bat we're hit with background on Richelle Mead's world of vampires. There's no way around a big info dump, so that's fine. Rose and Lissa have a bond beyond the mystical, they're best friends and that comes across in the movie. Dimitri comes across too. Seriously, he has a huge presence in every scene he's in. Lissa's accent took a couple minutes to adjust to and there were a few curious casting choices like fire starter Christian. My version of him is a tad less hot, or at least much angstier. And my version of Christian does not have an accent unless you consider hostility an accent.

The mystery isn't so mysterious since I read the books. There's a bully lurking around campus writing threatening messages in blood. And there's an awful classmate. She's more on the pipsqueak side of things. I really hated her in the books, but I just wanted to put her in a time-out in the movie. Rose has some terrific lines and delivers them perfectly. I loved the self-deprecating humor, that was spot on with the books.

If you're a die hard VA fan, I'm not sure what your take on the movie will be. There are a couple change ups and like always some of the best parts are either cut or abbreviated, but Rose rocks and she is the star. Dimitri makes you swoon. Lissa can be annoying, but she annoyed me in the books too. Christian needs a shirtless scene in the next movie. I think the action and storyline will only get better over the span of the movie franchise if there will be a movie franchise. There is no lurking scene after the credits roll, but I wanted one because I wanted more. That says a lot right there. I hope you enjoy the movie too!",1391731200,66,1958,4.373626373626373

6197896,5,B00HQOFIA0,"Ok, I know this movie has mixed reviews.... but guys, its the MOVIE, not the book. Of course there are some things that are going to be different, or things that they left out, but I kinda think that is what the movie is for... to get you curious enough to go and buy the book and read it... and it being VA ... you won't be able to stop at the first book. I think we forget why movies are made.... they're made to entertain, and I have to admit, this was extremely entertaining. The books are hours, and hours long and there's no way you could fit all of that into a movie, especially because 85% of it is all in Rose's head. From the many, many times I have watched this movie it gets me excited to read the books again, I wish there were more of these book-to-movies, especially the ones that I read. But I digress (i'm getting off topic, I know) WATCH THE MOVIE! but then go back and read the book. There's tons more insight that you get from the book (don't be lazy, do the reading). Kinda like Trailers are to movies.. I feel movies are to books. Countless hours of writing, hundreds of pages from the book get put into a script as they try to compact it all into less than two hours of movie. I think they did a great job and can't wait to see more (hint, hint.)",1480723200,,1269,4.08

Watched the movie with skepticism at first, then found myself surprised that I really liked it. Not for everyone, but if you give it a chance, you may find you actually like it. Went on to read the series after this. Movie a little different than the book, but then most movies are. Can't fit everything in the book into the movie.",1480032000,,499,4.4945054945054945

The movie isn't much like the books - a lot of the characters are nothing like I pictured in my head - BUT I do think that they nailed the main character and the overall spicy, spunky feel of the series. It's a fun-to-watch teen vampire movie that even my husband sat down to enjoy, and I could see us pulling this out for a teen movie night.",1471651200,,453,3.989010989010989

It's not as good as the book (but movies rarely are) but it was very entertaining.  Great cast, especially the 2 main characters Rose and Lissa.  The budget was low for the movie but not so low that you noticed all the time.  The movie was funny, witty, fantasy and a fun fluffy watch. I highly recommend.",1471651200,,424,4.185185185185185

6197926,4,B00HQOFIA0,i like this movie but i was disappointed that they left out the depression and self harm element from the book i thought it could have been a valuable measure for promoting how to help someone with depression and self harm issues. however it was cool that the cuts on Lissas arms were a side effect of her powers.,1469577600,,313,4.322033898305085

6197932,2,B00HQOFIA0,Horrible! Really awful! I guess it's difficult when characters communicate without speaking - how do you bring that to the screen? They couldn't do it with Dune - not that Vampire Academy is on the same level. It's too bad because I liked the books but it was obvious after seeing this movie why they didn't continue with more movies for the series.,1466726400,,349,4.555555555555555

The man who plaid him was not heart throby or God like. He kind looked dumpy to me and could have been taller.

In reading the novel, it was pretty faithful to the material - not entirely of course - but way better than Twilight. It kind of sucks how they won't be doing any additional sequels because I'd like to see the other novels made into films, oh well.

I understand that it probably isn't everyone's cup of tea and that many book readers have pointed out differences from the source material. I decided to read the book series after watching this because it piqued my interest. I love vampires and this is definitely a fresh take on the genre. This movie is for anyone who enjoys sassy and witty protagonists, vampires, teenage angst, and a bit of ass kicking. Also, I know know opinions are mixed about the casting of Dimitri. Personally, I like the fact that Danila was cast. A Russian playing a Russian. What a novel idea.

Since posting this review I have read the book (and am reading the rest of the series, too) and I stand by my review. This movie is NOT the book but it is enjoyable and fun.",1462406400,,818,4.527027027027027

6197950,3,B00HQOFIA0,"This movie makes me so sad. I first read the book that this movie is based off of as a young teen, and I grew with the series. I still enjoy going back to read them. But even as a book fan, I try to go into book-based movies without much in expectations. For this particular movie, I went in with extremely low expectations. Even then, just a few minutes into the movie, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into?"" The movie explains the fantasy world poorly, rushing a whole voice-over explanation into the first few minutes. It does slowly get better - the action-packed ending is pretty much the same as any action scene, but nothing can make up for the silly bulk of the movie.

I can't tell who this was aimed at. Vampire Academy has some darker themes going for it, but the humor in the movie seems aimed at young children. It's beyond ridiculous. It lacks the wit and heart of the books, and the whole thing screams condescension (I'm assuming from the producers). The actors all did a fine job, though Zoey Deutch is the only one who stands out to me. She embodies Rose, adds life and character to the otherwise strange and inconsistent film. She's the shining star here. I have no idea who would enjoy the movie - probably young kids? But it seems aimed at teen girls, and even they would be able to tell what a mess it is.

I hesitated to even give 3 stars, but I decided to give them because of the general storyline, Zoey Deutch, and my love of the books.",1459728000,,1478,4.31294964028777
6197951,2,B00HQOFIA0,"I'm really sorry I watched this movie.  First of all, let me say that I just started reading the first book a day or so ago and am nearing the end.  Is it the best young adult/fantasy/horror/etc., book I've ever read.. No.... but it is entertaining.  So I thought, 'What the heck...I'll see how close the movie comes to capturing the mood, characters and story'.  I'm usually able to accept that things have to be changed and altered for a Movie, so I was prepared for that.  Here's the scoop, from someone who isn't a VA Super-fan (yet) who just wants to hate on the is movie because it isn't exactly like the books.
The movie seems superficial, and most of the time it has more of a 'Made for TV movie' vibe than an actual 'Cinematic Experience'... at times, it is downright 'Sit-com-y', and a few times it almost enters 'After-School Special' territory (am I dating myself here?...sorry);  The scenes are VERY rushed (it seems as if some of them only last about 10-15 seconds before we are thrown into the next one); it relies quite a bit on exposition rather than good storytelling (telling rather than showing), and most of the characters are way more annoying than they are in the books. A few minor changes could've added depth to the story and characters (in my opinion...which all of this is, of course).
I'll agree with several others' comments, however.  If you don't plan on reading the books, this might be a fun movie.  But don't expect, or accept, that it accurately represents the book...it doesn't.  Read the book.",1459468800,,1531,4.619926199261992
6197952,3,B00HQOFIA0,I like the movie a great deal.  Had I not read the books previously I would have liked it a lot more.  I think this was cast well based off of the descriptions within the books.  I do feel they strayed a bit too much for my liking from the book.  However I did enjoy it.  A lot of action and while some actors were better than others it was an enjoyable movie and I'll watch it again.,1457481600,,384,3.871794871794872
6197953,2,B00HQOFIA0,"I read the VA series and the books were great! I also understand that books need to be slightly altered to make for a good movie and fit the format. I should have known the movie would be dumbed-down when I saw the marketing posters 'They Suck at School'..... Really!? The movie was so panned that they cancelled a sequel! Shame on the marketing department and scriptwriter for turning their backs on the novels' fans!

The movie takes the books down to a tween level. So if you're a tween you may love this movie. If you're older- regardless of whether you read the book or not- it may/will seem very silly.
I thought the dialogue was awful and the new scenes are just embarrassing. (Blood spray??... Hmm)

The actors were ok- everyone envisions the characters differently so casting is always tricky. They did make the lead Rose more of a Juno-esque character which was annoying. And I do agree with others that her 'tan skin and curvy body' are missing-lol.

I love tween films, teen films, chick flicks, vampire stuff-- all that-- but this movie is just awful-- especially once you read the novels.

I really wish this movie would have been made differently and then we'd have 5 more VA movies to look forward to!",1457395200,2,1217,4.594470046082949

6197955,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I was always taught that Hate is a strong word and should never be used but I hate this movie. These books were something special to me and this director took their perfection and ruined every little thing about them. Nothing about this whole movie was even remotely perfect or similar to the books.

If you want a lighthearted movie and never intend to read the books then have at it. But if you have actually read the books and loved them as much as I have, do not watch this movie. It is absolutely horrible.

The characters are nothing like those in the books, the tone of the movie is completely different, they portrayed Maori like cheesy vampires with obviously fake fangs and hissing noises and they tried to make it overly funny and that's not what it is. Rose is hilarious. She is witty and sarcastic and alluring. She has an extremely guarded heart yet at the same time is so vulnerable it's shocking. Lissa is a beautiful and shy girl who has this darkness in her that threatens to overcome her with every second that passes. Also, she is not Australian. She's from Montana for God's sake. The acting in this movie feels as though the actors never even read the books. The characters do not look anything like their characters (Don't even get me STARTED with Natalie). Also, should I even mention the creepy Rose Dimitri love thing? The actor (although attractive) is NOT Dimitri. He's like 40 years old. This makes things verrrry awkward. Dimitri is only supposed to be 7 years older than Rose. This guy looked like her Uncle or something...

Also, the actors themselves have no respect for the readers of this story. In multiple interviews they have said how ridiculous we were for getting so angry at how much they changed. People have to realize that unlike movies where you invest 2-3 hours in a movie and then forget about it, people invest hours upon hours in the books. They are able to go deeper in to the characters than a movie ever could allow them. So yes, these books mean more than anyone can understand to fans.

I literally could go on for hours about how terrible this movie is. Not that I expected much from the director of Mean Girls (A fantastic movie). It feels like he took everything he tried from Mean Girls and put it towards this movie. The books (although many say that they aren't) are seriously dark books. Yes they have a light air about them at times with Rose's humor but over all, book after book the story just gets darker and darker. This movie is more like a parody of the books. I pray to God they do not make another movie because frankly it would be an even grater insult to the books.  It was so inappropriate to do this to this story.

And for everyone who might reply with ""Well the author loved the movie and was there helping them make it"" She has said multiple times that she sold the rights to this story and in return had no control over what they did with it. Yes she went along and tried to help them get it right but she could not change anything they decided to do.

I understand the argument ""if you didn't like it, don't watch it"" and I don't plan on investing anymore time in this horrid, terrible movie but I want everyone to understand just how bad it is. This is the perfect example of ""THE BOOKS ARE BETTER"" because they are.

If you want to know about the story, go read the books. They are absolutely amazing. I have literally read them 10+ times because I love the story so much. They are not too complicated to understand, they are captivating from the very beginning and hold you to the very end.",1456272000,,3572,4.4179331306990886

6197957,1,B00HQOFIA0,"Vampire Academy had huge potential to be an AWESOME franchise. Richelle Mead's books are well written with compelling storylines for days. However, the script missed the boat, lacking the dramatic appeal of the book it was based on.

It was full of action with some drama and some touching stuff, but not too much. If you're looking for a feel-good movie that's not going to make you too emotional then you should watch it.",1452988800,,365,4.228571428571429
6197967,4,B00HQOFIA0,"I really, REALLY liked this movie. For a book to movie adaptation, it was very well done. The book, of course, is going to have more time to set the scene and go into detail about the plot. They kept the ""bones"" of the book and only made minor adjustments to make it work in a movie. If you have read the first book then watch this film, you will be able to notice the parts they changed, left out, and added to make it work for the screen. But truly and honestly, you can tell they kept it to the book, which I love. The first time I saw this, I had never read the books. I watched the movie, loved it, and was hoping (and expecting) a second film. The ending of the film leaves you wanting more, to find out what is going to happen. This is a great movie if you have read the books and if you haven't read the books, it is still a great movie to watch.
I'm not going to go through the entire plot in my review. All I am going to say is that the plot of the movie is interesting (To me, after reading the books, the plot in the first book {which is this movie} is more juvenile then the other books. I was hoping they would continue making these movies because I liked the rest of the series more and more as it went on. The first book was just the beginning, they get more and more interesting. **now back to the movie review)  The beginning of the movie gives a lot of important information about the different kinds of vampires. It may not be the most interesting part but it is important. And I am also going to say that this movie shows a story about a unique friendship that is quite amazing.
 I gave this movie a 4 out of 5 mainly because I didn't love how the movie was filmed in some scenes (not a ton of the scenes, but enough to lose a star). That may sound weird- but in my opinion, some scenes (like the punch that Rose gives Mia, when Rose has one of her ""visions"", and the initial fight scene between Rose and Dimitri) shot the way they were, made me almost laugh because it was like reading a Jane Austen novel with a Dr. Seuss line in it here and there. This is just my opinion though.
I love the cast of the movie. I think they did an exceptional job at who they had play the main characters. Rose has many funny one-liners, and Zoey Deutch really did them justice and, honestly, she just did her character, Rose, justice. The cast makes this movie funny (in a good way), interesting, and overall a fun movie to watch. There is mystery, dramatic scenes, friendships, crushes, fight scenes. There is really something in here for everyone.
After watching this movie, I went right into the second Vampire Academy book. Then the third book, then the fourth book, and THEN I decided to read the first book. I read it in half a day because it was truly like the movie. (Then I finished off the series with book five and six). If you liked this movie, I suggest reading the books.
 I was hoping they were going to make a second movie. They really left it open to one. But, now after almost 2 years from the release date, it will probably not happen. But I still wish they would. The second book is one of my favorites. The plot is more interesting in my opinion, you get to see Rose become more of who she is, and you end up just loving all the characters even more.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in it. It is one of the best vampire movies out there. The vampires aren't silly and the acting is pretty decent. There are funny one-liners, cool fight scenes, romances, and friendships in the movie. It really is for anyone.",1452902400,5,3561,4.1729651162790695

6197977,4,B00HQOFIA0,"As a huge Vampire Academy fan I was absolutely thrilled when I heard they were making a movie and bought it the first chance I got. And  I was not disappointed. Great acting choices. The story had me hooked from the very first scene up until the ending credits. Zoey did a great job at bringing the amazing Rose Hathaway to life on screen. And Danila, loved him. He pulled off the strong, stoic, fierce exterior that is Dimitri.  But above all else, who I found most impressive was Sarah as Natalie. She was quirky, spastic and obnoxious and yet so sweet. I don't think anyone else could pull off the role better.
  The reason that I only gave four stars was that I do agree with some people in that the Water brothers did give the movie the feel of Mean Girls, where Vampire Academy should have a darker more serious edge to it in my opinion. Then again, ass kicking guardians or not they still are in high school... and the Mean Girls vibe did pull of the general student body pretty well... at least in my experience.
  Overall almost five stars and a great movie and I sincerely hope they make a sequel.

First, I couldn't make head nor tales of the class system here. There are bad and crazy vampires, middle of the road vampires, and their protectors (half vampires). Ok, why would a vampire need a protector ?  The middle of the road vampires apparently have royalty of which one of the main characters is one. Got that? The two main characters are Lissa and her protector, Rose.  They used to go to a vampire school but left it now they are back because the school went and got them. They are under some vague threat that the bad vampires want to use Lissa for her powers or some such. Rose is tasked with protecting her. Lissa has a hunky part bad vampire (of course) love interest. Rose has a much older and larger vampire protector, the humorless Dimetri. Oh boy is this actor wrong for the part. He was very good looking but he looks much older than Rose, can't act too well and worse, can hardly speak english. He whisper's every line. But the movie implies that Rose and he are semi equals.. which is laughable because Rose is so tiny and thin next to him.

I believe the best of the twilight saga was the first movie, it was low budget with good actors and special affects. It wasn't bad bad but it was decent.

The filmmakers clearly tried to stay very true to the book. By doing this the pace of the movie was a little rushed and fast but I understand why. Zooey Deutch was a wonderful Rose in my opinion. She is a great actress and really did great zinging those one liners like Rose and playing a dedicated best friend/guardian. Actually, I think most of the actors cast did a good job.  My one problem with the movie was with Rose and Dimitri's attraction.  While the actor who played Dimitri was quite handsome, I don't think he is a very talented thespian. I don't know if it was the language barrier or what but it was quite painful to watch. That bad acting definitely took away from any real romantic connection they were trying to portray on screen. It is too bad they did not find a better actor to play such a strong and complex character because the romantic bond that blossoms between Dimitri and Rose in the book is a huge part of the story. Besides that I think it was a pretty darn good movie!",1436659200,7,1314,4.2730923694779115

6198039,2,B00HQOFIA0,"I have read every Vampire Academy book as well as the Bloodline series more than once. I was so excited when I heard they were making a movie of it. I finally got a chance to watch the movie and I was pretty let down. First off, why does Lissa have an accent like that? She's supposed to be from Montana. No one else at the school had an accent... Overall, the characters are nothing like I had pictured from the descriptions in the book. I could have dealt with that though, but how each scene was performed was not good. They just kept flitting around and if you hadn't read the books, you probably would have been lost. I think the flow of the movie could have been better. More details from the books should have been added into the movie also. Since we were already running with hearing Rose's thoughts, they could have added a little more feeling. Everyone basically just looked like they were running around from place to place. So, in my opinion, this movie was a major letdown.

This series has so much potential though. I mean, it could literally make a whole series (just like Harry Potter) and then it even conveniently comes with a spinoff! I would like to see the movie remade and it would be great if the public could get a say in who is cast. We have a certain image in our heads and I know its not up to us, but it would be nice if they would at least go by the exact description in the books. Please don't just cast this aside.

Yes, the story does deviate slightly in some places, but that always happens.  I was very disappointed with how poorly this did in the theaters, but I have to imagine that was due to general audiences being OD'd on all things Twilight, and therefore not interested in a teen vampire flick.

I might not have liked it so much if I had read the books first as I am usually disappointed by the movies when I see them after reading the book(s), but I'm glad I watched the movie first in this instance. The one thing I will say, however, is that by not reading the book first I found myself very confused in the beginning of the movie because they jumped right in with no explanation.

In particular, she is attached to Lissa, a princess in the vampire world who has yet to declare her magical power (earth, air, fire or water) and who is clearly in danger, both without and within the school, the Vampire Academy.

Everyone, generally, is young and pretty in this movie and its a combo of high school issues (like who likes who and who hates who) mixed up with a hint of more adult politics, but barely.  I liked the relationship between Rose and Lissa, but everything really was pretty predictible.

 We learn of a new race of people in Vampire Academy, sort of.  The half-human, half-vampire Dhampir are the protectors of the nice vampires, the Moroi and enemies of the bad vampires, the Strigoi.  If this is a bit beyond your usual vampire lore, read the books.  Author Richelle Mead penned a total of six books aimed at teens in the Vampire Academy series, selling some 8 million copies.  That should give her a nice fan base to entice into the darkened theaters.  But that isn't the end of her work.  Another half dozen books have followed from her busy computer in the spin off Blood Line series.  Her work has attracted several book awards, including the wonderfully named Quick Picks for Young Reluctant Readers award for 2008.
 Daniel Waters (Batman Returns, Heathers) wrote the screenplay from the original novel by Mead.  The incredible success of the Twilight and Hunger Games films spawns another movie based on a book for romantic young girls.
 Mark Waters directs using his experience with such successes as Mean Girls and Freaky
Friday to guide him.  Director Mark Waters and screenwriter Daniel Waters are brothers.
 This low budget teen/vampire flick saved plenty of money by using attractive young people for the stars, many of whom come from the TV world.  Zoey Deutch (TV and recently on film in Beautiful Creatures) stars as Rose Hathaway, the Dhampir who protects Lucy Fry (also TV) who plays Princess Lissa Dragomir, her BFF.  In his first English speaking role we have new to us Russian actor Danila Kozlovsky as the exotically handsome Victor Dashkov.",1427414400,,1658,5.044117647058823

Humor via Zoey Deutch is precisely what keeps Vampire Academy from being a terrible movie, but alas, VA was a box office bomb and the idea for a sequel is officially nixed (Budget: $30 million, Box office: $15.4 million. Ouch!)

Dimitri, rose, and Lissa are cast perfectly, but the writing and directing is what needed some work. It seemed to keep trying to be something it wasn't, like a cross between twilight and mean girls.

In Harry Potter: Camber Of Secrets, some mysterious person goes around killing small animals and hanging them up then writing threats on the wall in blood. Hey, guess what? The same freaking thing happens in Vampire Academy. REALLY? Exactly the same. Then to add insult to injury, some of the vampire castes can do ""magic."" They have ""powers."" I really am NOT making this up. Its Potter and Twilight, seriously. Skip this movie...please.",1421280000,,1080,4.630208333333333

6198108,5,B00HQOFIA0,"I got this movie shortly after I started to read the series and I decided on to watch the movie after a little bit. Since I didn't want to watch the movie before I finished the book.

Everyone always think that when a book turns into a movie that the movie would suck and not work very well. For me I was a little bit worried about watching it since I had read some reviews about the movie sucked but after I started to watch it I decided that I did like it.

 The reason for that is because it is really good. The only point of view we got from the Vampire Academy book series is Rose Hathaway's view and in the movie we have a bunch of other views. It's a really good movie and I actually love what they did to it. Everything about the movie reminds me a lot of the book and even more so since they added their own twists and stuff to it that the author Richelle Mead said that she would have liked to added it to the books.

This movie is really good and I recommend anyone that has read the books and liked them to watch the Vampire Academy and not fall in love with this movie. I mean even my mother liked the movie and she didn't even read the book series at all.",1420588800,7,1169,3.9617021276595743

They stayed with the story we have read but the acting felt forced and the movie low budget. I was so excited to see this as both my daughter and I loved the books and we felt it was not as good as it should have been. I understand it did not have the twilight budget but you can clearly see that more effort needed to be put into the story and the acting. I bought and will watch again but if you have never read the books please do so before watching this movie the books are amazing and the move is just ok.,1419724800,,674,3.8214285714285716

I've been a fan of the books for so many years and was undecided on how I felt about them making a film. They showed trailers that did not go with the film at all. It might be why many people avoided it when it was released in theaters. I didn't have a problem with the casting or scene changes, which always happens anyway but depends on how much they change for certain scenes. I felt like I was watching a movie on fast forward the entire time. Each scene was over in seconds and if you didn't read the book it wouldn't be easy to fill in the blanks. It could have been a great film but with how quick it went and the delivery of each quip, it didn't work out in the end. I would still like to see a sequel but I don't think it will reach theaters any time soon. Oh and the cgi was horrible.",1419206400,,873,3.965909090909091

 I was so surprised and delighted by this movie and the young actresses who play the two main characters. One of them I recognize from a television show based in Australia about young mermaids. It was a very cute television show and I was happy to see the actors in this movie.

Because this movie was geared towards the young adult moviegoers,  I did not think we would relate to the characters.  But the casting was excellent and I was able to totally enjoy the interactions of the characters.  Anything having to do with vampires is right up my alley and I recommend this movie to anyone who is drawn towards this type of movie.  This story revolves around a 'princess' and her protector and an unknown enemy, who turns out to be a friend.

6198150,4,B00HQOFIA0,Suspend your sense of reality and don't expect too much you should enjoy this movie.

6198165,5,B00HQOFIA0,"Adaptations tend to either be extremely good or extremely bad. Very rarely do they ever fall in the middle. This adaptation of the Vampire Academy book falls into that middle ground, up so close to good that I have to go ahead and give it five stars.

Is it word for word? NO. There's no way it could be. But, the changes were either very subtle or at least very plausible and gave it a very ""current"" feel. In some cases, the added dialogue actually made it better, in my opinion.

The actors... I give those choices a 99% positive. I did find the change to a much younger headmistress to be a less than wise choice. Not that the actress playing the part didn't do a good job. She did. It just made no sense to me to make that change. It didn't better the story.

Truly sorry to see that they've put production of the second book, Frostbite, on indefinite hold. I was really looking forward to seeing these actors resume their rolls.",1415923200,,934,4.325714285714286

The acting, dialog and effects were pretty awful with sort of a home made or college project feel to it.  I wish I had waited until it was on Prime but at least I rented it SD (so cheapest option other than Prime).

My biggest complaint was with Dimitri.  With Dimitri more was better as in the more clothes the better he looked.  When he wore the sleeveless top it was obvious he did not work out regularly but when they had the scene of him in his underwear it made me wonder if he ever worked out at all (flabby).

6198210,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I love the books. I re-read them all the time. So it's safe to say that I was really excited to see the first book turned into a movie. However, the movie isn't anything like the book. The names are the same, there are some of the same scenes in the movie but that's about where the similarities end. The characters do not act the same in the movie, there are a bunch or random scenes added into the story that were not in the book, and a lot of parts that were in the book are taken out of movie. It was a very teeny bopper over dramatized vampire edition of Mean Girls, which shouldn't be overly surprising since the director is the same person for both movies.
When the movie wasn't boring me to death, I was cringing as I watched one of my favorite books being slowly butchered apart. My husband kept looking over at me throughout the movie asking me questions about what was going on and I just kept responding with ""I don't know, this wasn't in the book. I don't know what is going on."" It was worse than watching the Twilight saga. If they come out with another movie I will pass.

One of Richelle's primary weaknesses in the books actually is the mention of humor but no actual humorous dialog! Or very, very little. The movie rectifies this nicely. Zoey has great comedic ability.  Some of the other actors seemed to really stuggle in their roles. I'm not sure who played Kirova, but she was one of the worst.

Also, and I HATE to say this, but the gentleman playing Dimitri was just not hot enough. Dimitri is described endlessly as a god and this guy just wasn't even close. I could have rolled with a ruggedly handsome Dimitri if I felt the chemistry was there between the 2 of them, but even that was lacking. Looking on Imdb...this actor did look better at some point, so I don't know what happened?  Generally I don't harp on the appearance of actors, preferring to focus on, oh I don't know, their ACTING. But in this role, I think his appearance was pretty crucial. ok OK...rant over!

I have to admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of the book by Richelle Mead, the series got better afterwards but Im not one to rave about it. Thats why I decided that for once I would not go into a book to movie adaptation judging it by the book. A fresh start. And boy did it need it!

To put it simply it wasn't a great film and definitely not one of my favourites. Everything felt a bit flat from the acting to the pace of the story. There was a lot of information dumping at the start which was necessary (especially for people who haven't read the book) but to make sure it wasn't boring they chucked it at you really fast so then it didn't then serve the purpose because you didn't properly understand.

The action scenes were also pretty pathetic to be honest. You had the fights with the strigoi where it was one person after the other chucking themselves at the vampire, but it made it seem like they were all lined up shuffling along saying yep, hes dead off you go George. Then the training fighting was just as bad because they were trying to showcase vampire strength/speed without making it so fast you couldn't see anything. Add that to the fact that it was unbelievably staged (it is obviously, but they could try to make it less forced) and it felt unrealistic.

Zoey Dutch, who plays Rose was the only good part. I know I tried to go into this movie without comparing to the book but in this case it worked out well because she was the embodiment of the Rose I pictured. She was kick-ass and funny and protective and portrayed so well compared to some of the others. For example Lisa who just didn't do much for me and then of course Dimirti. Dimirti was played by Danila Kozlovsky, and I have to be completely honest. I didn't like him. He looked for too old for Rose and there wasn't any chemistry between them anyways. Maybe it was because you didn't see many scenes with them together so it didn't feel like they knew each other as well as they were portrayed to at the end.

Oh and I couldn't forget Christian! Played by Dominic Sherwood he was very mysterious (again just like he is in the book; you can see I failed with my resolution to forget the book in the end) and I loved that about him. The scene near the end when he said he couldn't use his fire outside the classroom, only to kill the wolves was among my favourites.

By the end I felt like a lot of the individual scenes weren't that necessary and maybe if they cut some out the movie in general would be better paced, and so the remaining scenes could have more of an impact. They also could have chucked in a couple montages, and that may have contributed better than a whole load of quick-edited scenes like they did.

6198272,1,B00HQOFIA0,"Nestled in the wilderness of rural Montana, St. Vladimir's is like a Hogwarts Academy for fledgling bloodsuckers. The main vampire-in- training is Lissa (Lucy Fry), who, after a number of years living on the ""outside,"" is back at school to finish up her education. She's accompanied by Rose (Zoey Deutch), a sassy, feisty human who serves as Lissa's 24/7 ""guardian"" and with whom she shares a psychic connection.

While St. Vladimir's curriculum may run to such unconventional subjects as magic, compulsion, martial arts and Romanian history, the school itself plays host to all the cliques, backbiting and teenage hanky panky that exist in even the least supernatural of high schools.

There are ""good"" vampires and ""bad"" vampires and all sorts of in-between vampires, but ""The Vampire Academy,"" which is based on a 2007 novel by Richelle Mead, is just a pale imitation of ""Twilight"" and ""The Vampire Diaries."" What's different is the flippant, sarcastic tone that's supposed to make it hipper and more self-aware than those straighter takes on the subject. But the effort falls flat simply because kitsch that doesn't take itself seriously is always far worse than kitsch that does, mainly because it demonstrates a lack of respect for its fan base. All this is true of ""Vampire Academy,"" despite the best efforts of Deutch and ""Modern Family""'s Sarah Hyland, who plays the nerdy chatterbox of the undead set. Somehow, top-tier actor Gabriel Byrne has also wandered - inadvertently, one presumes - onto the set, but even a performer of his caliber can't manage to breathe life into this toothless take on the already over-saturated teen-vampire genre.

Though the movie wraps things up with a tidy moral message at the end, there's the ominous suggestion that there may indeed be a sequel in the offing (there are many more books in the series from which to cull further material, which already doesn't look promising). Let's hope someone drives a stake through this particular movie's heart before it rises from its coffin to do any further damage.",1407888000,3,2051,5.062130177514793

6198284,4,B00HQOFIA0,"I didn't know what to expect with this one, I haven't read the books and was dreading another Twilight, but it's definitely not that.  More resembles Harry Potter but with older characters and bit more humour thrown in if you had to compare it to something.  It is a formulaic piece, so a lot of scenes and the outcome of the movie is predictable.  I really liked one of the two main characters, Rose played by Zoey Deutch.  I didn't expect this type of movie to have a wisecracking character in it, sort of reminded of the dark haired girl in that TV show Two Broke Girls but Rose seemed a lot more intelligent and her comments less like set ups.  The other main character who her character is a bodyguard for I thought lacked a bit of substance. She was a bit boring, you could see what they were trying to do with that character and perhaps with the time you have with the pages on a book you could achieve a better result.  She does the job she's there for but honestly you could make a sequel without her and the movie wouldn't be that lesser an experience without her.  You couldn't have a sequel without Rose though as her character drives the plot.

Also not knowing anything about it I was pleasantly surprised when a nerdy version of Sarah Hyland appeared (Natalie), the actress who plays Haley from Modern Family. Everything else I've seen her in she pretty much just plays a similar character to Haley so I quite enjoyed the different character.  Although you could see where her character was going with the plot, she was still fun to watch.  Actually she's the only actress in the whole film I recognised from somewhere else, which I think helps to make the other characters more believable in their roles.

Vampire Academy isn't the greatest film you'll ever see, but it's a fun way to pass the time and I enjoyed it enough that I'd check out a sequel if they ever make one.",1407628800,,1889,4.430635838150289

6198289,3,B00HQOFIA0,It was entertaining. The main actors did a good job portraying the characters in the book. Kirova could have been casted much better. Olga's performance was lacking.

6198292,1,B00HQOFIA0,I agree with a past reviewer when he/she said that it was an insult to the writer the way that they portrayed her characters. I didn't recognize a single actor and all of the acting was horrible except the girl that played Rose who did a decent job in conveying the character with the script that she was given. Don't even get me started on Lissa or Dimitri. Lissa was even more of a whiney mess in the movie than the book and the casting of DImitri was atrocious. It didn't look right that they picked someone that looked that much older than Rose to play him. It was like watching a thirty something year old man hitting on a seventeen. I've read the books but even if I hadn't I would still rate this movie the same. I could only watch like thirty minutes but sadly I bought it without renting first.,1407369600,3,803,4.254901960784314

6198295,3,B00HQOFIA0,"If you have read the entire VA series, chances are you are tempted to watch this movie and would end up loving it. Although Rose/Dimitri may not be what you imagined when you watch the movie, you will eventually learn to love the characters.. simply because you loved the book series and no matter how much you complain, let's face it - you can never get enough of it!

Character selection wise, I was ok with the choices and I think they did a good job as actors. Scenes are mostly true to what's described in the book and I was particularly impressed with the psi-hounds scene. However, I sincerely wish the script writer cut down on the cheesy lines. Although Richelle Mead's VA series was geared toward pre-teens, if you carefully notice her fan base, it's mostly women of all ages and that's rather impressive. I wish they kept this in  mind while making the movie. Mead's writing definitely surpasses the poor script.

Also, I was thinking that from the perspective of someone who had never read the book, the movie could be pretty confusing as it doesn't do a good job of explaining certain things - such as the bond between Rose/Lisa and why it's unique and important. Felt like they tried to cram a lot of information in a short time. BUT the ending definitely got me excited for the new movie to come.

If you haven't read the book and liked the movie or the trailer, read the book. It's worth it.",1407283200,2,1407,4.484375

The movie characters were such a buzz kill. The person playing Rose Hathaway was by far annoying, trying too hard to play the role when she should've been eased into it. The guy who is supposed to play Dimitri sucked very badly that I was very disappointed because he doesn't even sound Russian. The girl who was supposed to play as Lissa was too tall, to big lipped and did not act like how she does in the book.

The book characters are so much better, that I'm very greatly disappointed in the movie and recommend everyone to read the book series first, then the movie. Not the other way around.",1407110400,,835,4.2125

Every single character was annoying. The acting was horrific. The movie sped you along at break neck speed with no character development.

The only actor I think they got right was Gabriel Byrne playing Victor. Other than that, I was not happy with the choices especially Rose, Lissa and Dimitri. Rose was supposed to be more meaty and full-figured; Lissa was supposed to be beautiful; and Dimitri was supposed to be a gorgeous God. The acting was subpar, at best. There are some things that I don't remember from the book that got thrown in there, I guess for laughs, but totally ruined the movie for me. Rose seemed too full of humor in the movie instead of showing her serious side that is portrayed in the books. I really don't care to see anymore of these movies, because they have somewhat ruined the books for me.

I dislike the beginning of a movie that has been adapted from a book. There is always the inevitable info dump that sets up the world that the story takes place in. What is told by the book through the events of the story are just unceremoniously dumped at the beginning the movie. The quicker to get to the good part, I guess. But, that is my only real complaint.

I've read every book at least 6 times. This movie though wasn't exactly what I wanted but it did have the main plot. I think the producers added more info about Rose and Lissa's bond than necessary. Granted, that was to entrance viewers who didn't have a clue about the books until they saw the movie. And maybe they added the unnecessary info in hopes that vampire academy would get many more viewers.
That being said, my opinion is, This movie should have left you in suspense where in reality it left you satisfied.
Mia was hilarious though. Prissy B****. Mmhmm just like in the book. Yay. Hooray for you. It was enjoyable. Therefore it deserves 4 stars.",1403913600,,810,4.47972972972973

Of course the movie did have it's flaws, such as any book to movie, it felt rushed and too short for my liking and a certain speech that I was not that fond of. But apart from those small flaws, the movie was great! Great adaption of the book, everyone on the cast were chosen perfectly and i loved them and can't wait for the rest of the books to be made into movies! But of course, since overall movie sales weren't that great they haven't confirmed the next book, which is sad but if anyone who DOES want the movie to be made, y'all should get a twitter (if you don't already) and follow @officialvamovie (or you can go to facebook and like his page which has the same name as his twitter acct), who was the producer of Vampire Academy movie and is saying to get Frostbite, the VA Family need to gather together and do some steps to show to them that we do want a sequel and we did love the first movie. But first we need to help promote the movie to get as many new fans for the series and just plain talk about it, so the big guys have the confidence to continue. Because the fans did love it and we want more. Which then WILL lead to FROSTBITE and EDDIE and ADRIAN! SO im gonna do my part and look forward to getting more of Rose and everyone because this really is a good series that NEEDS to get made!

UPDATE: So Producers of this movie have literally heard our cry and are going through lots of lengths to have the Sequel Frostbite made, now as i said in my review earlier VA had its flaws and didn't do so well in the box office the producers still want to attempt at another go but this time for Frostbite! But in order for the movie to happen they have started a crowd funding! This is basically a fundraiser (like kickstarter, but on another site, where its INTERNATIONAL! YAY)
They started Aug 6. 2014 and we have already raised over 100,000! All the information on the cause as well as the perks for donating is on the link below!

Check it out!
I personally have donated and will be receiving my Signed Script if (pssh! I mean WHEN) we meet the goal!
CHECK IT OUT! They have pretty good things and will be adding many more perks do to demand from the VA Family, cause we rock!

I have not read the books on which this film was based, but feel that perhaps they might actually be worth reading. The protagonist had an interesting role, but the actress who played her came across as more silly than jaded. Overall the cast was underdeveloped and just generally boring, although I am not mad at the martial trainer's rather needless presence throughout the film (Danila Kozlovsky, who by all appearances seems to be a fully formed person attracted to strong, intelligent, beautiful women?).

In a nutshell, this flick seems to fall into the category of broody tween sci-fi that it actively tries to mock. Two stars because I am fascinated by the story, but not impressed with the overall film itself. Plus one and ""spasibo"" for introducing me to my new heartbreak.",1403740800,,895,4.811688311688312

6198446,5,B00HQOFIA0,"I am a huge fan of Richelle Mead's book series ""Vampire Academy."" That being said, I was nervous about the movie because of the way it was marketed. I thought they wouldn't have grasped the essence of the characters and the world that Ms. Mead created and that I fell in love with.

But marketing can be deceiving and, thankfully, that's the case with the film adaptation of the first ""Vampire Academy"" book.

First of all, the casting could not have been more perfect. Victor, Natalie, Christian, Lissa (whom I was not super fond of in the books, but adored in the movie), Dimitri, and, especially, Rose, were brought to life by the best actors possible. I cannot say enough about Zoey Deutch as Rose. She embodied the perfect amount of sass, snark, toughness, and vulnerability, plus she looked exactly how I pictured. Danila Kozlovsky was the ultimate Dimitri- the accent, the body, the hair, the beautiful eyes, and his ability to bring those rare unguarded moments out of Dimitri so seamlessly was amazing. The other characters I mentioned, their real life counterparts were also incredible and I could rave about each of them for days.

As a huge Dimitri and Rose fan, I was shocked with how much I loved the film version of them as well. Danila and Zoey have scorching hot chemistry and seem to work so effortlessly with one another. I loved the balance of serious and fun scenes between Dimitri and Rose, just as in the books. The only thing I wish the writers would have touched on was Dimitri offering to mentor Rose to help her catch up, but that's a miniscule detail.

The comedy and action blend perfectly in the film (as it was in the books) and I loved how fast it moved, but how they took the time to touch on all of the important elements.

Were some things left out or slightly changed? Yes, but you will find that with every adaptation. Personally, I absolutely LOVED this and I sincerely hope that there will be a sequel.",1403568000,,1941,4.582132564841499

They left out huge, important parts, and threw in made up stuff that didn't do anything for the plot. The chemistry flbetween Dimitri and Rose was nonexistent, and was the character development for Rose. She underwent major character trials in the book, and matured a lot, but the movie was lacking that. After watching it, it seems to be something that could be a parody, rather than a legitimate adaption. It didn't capture the essence of the book whatsoever, and iwas extremely disappointed.",1403481600,4,640,5.047169811320755

About the movie: Certainly not as bad as 90% of this year movie or TV batch.
This is teen girl romantic fantasy, not at its best, but still building its universe, telling a story that didn't felt strictly copy-pasted. The production and the acting felt a little bit low budget, unfocused and amateurish (bad CGIs wolf or hell dogs) but if you're in this kind of story, this won't be a complete waste of your time.

Story stayed true to the book mostly with a bit of artistic licence here & there obviously to keep the unintitiated involved & up to date with the story line.

6198459,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I never read the books, I understand they were very much lauded, but this movie seem to be a total yak fest. The Guardian Rose is forever talking and talking and not saying much other then how worried she is about her trust. She is a guardian to a Vampire teen of Royal blood. But the movie never really explains what the hell the school is all about other then seeming to be a Hogsworth for vampires. Their are apparently several families of royal blood but it only focuses on the one girl Ilse or something like that.
  Everything is just there and it has no context so is is more or less a gab fest because their is nothing deeper then the monotonous soliloquy by Rose about a bunch of subjects that are never fully developed.
  Thank God film makers haven't forgotten that Vampires aren't pleasant creatures who just happen to suck blood. Vampirism has always been considered a curse on a wicked or sinfull person who then by attacking others draws them into the same living hell.
  The Vampires of 30 days of night just appeared. But they didn't talk. They were obviously attracted by a place where the sun i gone for a long period and they can feast and fill their bellies with blood like it was Christmas. Because they are true Vampires in every sense of the word, the film dosent explain where they come from or how they are organized. But being true to the myth They are not prissy preening brats but animals, hunters in every sense of the word, thats what they are, thats who they are.
  Senseless and often irritating, Vampire Academy seems more like a film school students attempts to make a fairy tale with the good Vampires and the Villain Vampires. Oh and nice job ripping the familiar concept from Blade and converting it into the Vampire Guardian aspect of this film. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!",1403395200,2,1803,4.54320987654321

As every other book to movie adaptation it obviously had its differences and some things were changed, but it never changed the plot or the point of the story. I'm giving a very high rating because I'd give it a second watch and it was funny, mysterious and obviously action packed.

I thought the movie was fun and captured quite a bit of the flavor of the first book in the series. My husband (a scifi fan) felt the movies was incomprehensible and could barely follow the plot.

We both agreed that Lucy Fry as Lissa had an accent that was very difficult for us to understand. I needed to watch with the caption on to grasp what she was saying. The casting of Christian, Rose and Dimitri was good. I felt like Gabriel Byrne was phoning it in and too hammy for the part.

Overall, I enjoyed it as it layered on top of my already fond feelings for the series. I'm not sure if anyone who has not read the books would feel the same way. Given the poor box office I guess we do not need to wait for a sequel.",1403222400,2,834,3.9880239520958085

As someone familiar with the books, I felt the casting was appropriate. Zoey Deutch was fun as Rose, if not a tad grating at times. If you didn't know Rose going into the movie, I would imagine she'd be hard to take. Lucy Fry as Lissa, was fine, but not a standout. By far my favorite character and best casting was Danila Kozslovsky as Dimitri. He fit the bill physically and hit the mark as Rose's trainer who was falling for her. My favorite parts of the movie were when Rose and Dimitri were onscreen. They frequently made me smile as they tried to one-up the other and the actors had good chemistry.

I have not read this book series but I have now started to. I knew the movie was on a teen book series and so it was more like Twilight as that too is teenaged. I liked this movie more than I thought I would. Rose Hathaway has such a snarky, quirky, bad ass personality and I love that about her!

I have become fan of the movies Warm Bodies and Beautiful Creatures and this movie I think is better than those, while I still love them this is certainly a new movie I want to own! Do yourselves a favor, understand before you rent, buy or watch that this is on a level of teenage heard as Twilight but its not as girly, its more action and kick butt personalities. Also watch the trailers they have on youtube because its just rude to be incompetent and rate this low because you didn't pay any attention to what this movie is.

For one thing, the actors in this movie can actually act and have more than one facial expression, and the movie did have a lot of laughs.

This movie was definitely meant for the tween and young adult audience as it attempts to aim for the Twilight crowd. For me though, I had hoped it had the best of what Twilight and others in the vampire genre had but unfortunately for me (not in the age range the movie was intended) missed completely. I will agree with another reviewer here that said that the movie was campy, disjointed, overacted and rushed. The movie really didn't bother with giving us some background, instead choosing to quickly explain the dynamics of the vampires in a quick short narrative at the beginning of the movie. I am not familiar with the books but it seems to me that it didn't translate well to the big screen. It is unfortunate as the movie premise seemed to be promising but it got into too much teen angst for me to like it very much.",1402185600,,1097,4.625641025641026

All I can really say is that I hope the books are better, (I haven't read them) than the movie is. Except for some blood and mild swearing I'd call this one ""Disney does the vampire story"". I don't think it was a matter of budget or writing/direction I just couldn't make myself really enjoy this movie.
If you're expecting another ""Twilight"" (which gets a couple of references in the dialog) forget it- you won't find that here on any level. You get some interesting battle scenes (some better than others) and some other bits but I have a feeling that Vampire Academy sank at the box office because it was missing something- even though author Richelle Mead spoke highly of it during her DVD interview.
I wouldn't mind buying the books (I see they're cheaper 1 at a time than in the box set) but I'm hesitant to do that now. Perhaps the potential viewer should borrow at least the first book in the series before seeing the movie?",1401926400,,1154,4.44811320754717

I finally got a chance to see it (when I went to see it in theatres in my area it was already taken out, that should have been a sign). What did I watch??!?!

I brought it while on impulse, which I normally don't if I haven't seen the movie, and given the fact that it was out in DVD so quickly, I was a bit nervous. I am not one that was a big fan of twight, the 2nd book and film sucked, in my opinion (pun intended) and the I kind of felt cheated in the last, although it was alright and I did buy the films, all but the 2nd.  Anyway, back on track, I hadn't read the books and wasn't sure if this was a good buy but I kept the receipt. I really loved the movie, I'm not sure if it was just the different take on the vampire thing or the great acting or the story lines, but I really enjoyed the film. I loved Rose, the main character (one of ) she was witty and kick ass. She reminded me of faith on Buffy and Angel but less crazy.

Her friendship with Lissa a vampire princess is great and the icing on the cake is that the mentor that Rose likes is named Dimitri, which is my son's name, spelled the same way...I am conflicted since this guy is absolutely a ""god"", this is referenced in the movie a lot. It is funny, witty, action-packed and at times really goes for the heart ( again pun intended). I like vampires and this is a good vampire story. I enjoyed it so much I started reading the books and I have to say, this woman can really write. Way better thatn trying to labor through Twilight....There isn't much blood or bad words and there is one hot scene but there is no nudity, my son enjoyed the movie and I didn't have to make him close his eyes.

It really is a good fun movie, I do hope they will make a sequel, it plays up to one, so if they don't I will be a bit disappointed. Well I hope this helps...oh remember this is not Oscar worthy or meant to win any awards, but it is worth the 1 hour and half to watch and I have to admit, I have now watched it several times, mainly because of the humor and there were things I didn't catch before and it stills lives up to a 2nd or 3rd viewing, if you know what I mean. some movies you buy but there are great movies but to watch again you really have to be in the mood, this one is not so, maybe because it is so much fun. The casting was right on and the chick from ""Hit man"" is in it, funny role, she is good also, many of the actors are Russian due to setting (or they have Russian accents - Gabriel Byrnes is in it and he has a great part with a n accent).

And let me be very clear, Zoe Deutch is so fantastic in this awful, super campy film that you wish the film was better so that she'd have a series of films to follow like Jennifer Lawrence does with the Hunger Games. Unfortunately, the campiness just goes way too far. I think we're supposed to laugh with it but you will end up cringing. The actor who plays the love interest takes a bit to warm up to but his look is a joke that just keeps on getting worse.

6198550,2,B00HQOFIA0,"I enjoyed the VA books, but once I saw the preview for this, I knew I didn't want to see it in the theater. I'm amazed, after the success of YA books turned movies (Twilight, Hunger Games, Divergent) that the filmmakers thought it necessary to market this as such a campy film. Why anyone over the age of 16 would have wanted to see it after seeing the preview is beyond me (I suspect this is why it didn't do well in theaters).

But when it came out on DVD, I was willing to watch it. For such a detailed, interesting book this film is a flop. Aside from the over-acted/completely campy aspects of this (really, Mia? I know you're supposed to be a complete wench, but this was just so over the top), it was so rushed. If I hadn't read the books, I doubt I'd have been able to follow much of the plot. And after watching the deleted scenes, the ones with Mrs. Karp would have been very helpful. Considering this movie isn't all that long, it seems weird to me that the filmmakers wouldn't have slowed down the pace a little, in order to make sure the audience got the plot.

For example, after discovering Lissa's ""spirit"" power, the headmaster and Rose want to keep her locked away in a bunker for her safety (because it's obvious someone is after her). But as soon as Natalie brings up shopping, they decide to go and then to go to the dance (without any concern for Lissa's safety).

Casting wise, most of the actors were really good. Rose was especially well cast. But Dimitri? So disappointing. Dimitri is one of my favorite YA characters. He's supposed to be the greatest guardian of all time. Completely built, gorgeous and just deadly. In the film, Dimitri looks like someone's 30-something/slightly out of shape/gone to seed uncle.

6198551,5,B00HQOFIA0,"I saw it in the theatre twice and just bought it and watched it again. It's a fun movie, but it has serious elements in it that should be talked about. It addresses bullying, mental illness and self harm, and is an excellent example of strong women.

There are little differences here and there and some things are a little out of order, but it follows the first book's storyline really well overall. People who have read the books have said the books are more serious than this was. To this I say, it must have been a while since you read the first book, because Rose is VERY witty and sarcastic. Zoey really captured Rose in my opinion. There was also plenty of high school drama in that first book. People who haven't read the books have said the twist was too predictable. To them I say, that's how the book went down. If the movie makers didn't follow the book, hoards of fans would have been very disappointed.

Go in with an open mind. This isn't Twilight or Harry Potter or The Hunger Games. It's its own story and I think it's worth telling. I wish this would have been made at a time where people would have given it a chance. There is such a hate for vampires right now since the vampire craze is dying down.

I know that it's a young adult audience, but surely even they deserve a better film than this. I couldn't like the main character in the movie, she just didn't do it for me, and the main male lead....I found him creepy, not intriguing. I think they tried to cast him too old. I know he's old than her but this guy looks like he is 35, and he has no character development in the movie. He's a background character that all of a sudden she's in love with. If they weren't going to develop the relationship, they should have just found a way to cut that part out.",1401408000,,901,4.183908045977011
6198570,4,B00HQOFIA0,"So I got this movie because I had read Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy series along with the Bloodline series (which is a spin off of Vampire Academy). Although it was entertaining I felt they were rushing through the movie. They go with the book really well, but they skipped past things that I thought should have been a part of the movie. I am sticking by loving the books more than the movie. I feel I got more out of the books than this movie. It was too rushed for me. I understand they probably had to do that due to the size of the book. It is entertaining, but if you really like the books you may want to brace yourself for how fast the movie goes.",1401408000,,658,4.1484375
6198571,5,B00HQOFIA0,I thought the movie was very entertaining and they did well keeping to the events of the book. I hope Frostbite hits theaters next year!,1401321600,,136,4.48
6198572,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I'm so disappointed. I'm a fan of the series and I was looking forward to this movie from early on. The casting is terrible too. I didn't find any of the males in this movie to be attractive. Especially Dimitri, compared to the series. I could barely finish this movie. It skipped around everywhere. Zoey Deutchs voice was very annoying to me, but I don't mind her as an actress. I heard the director is the same director in Mean Girls. I think this is really where some of the problem comes it. Mean Girls is kind of a funny movie, with overly expressive characters. But, that is what makes that movie good. This movie isn't ment too be funny. Sarcastic, sure that's what keeps you hooked on Rose/Dimitri, Lisa/Christian pairing. But the over extent of being bitten, the music (right from the start), crappy fight sences doesn't really fit into how he book was laid out. It's ment to be a heroic, romance novel...not some joke, which this was. I hope that if you haven't read the book and you hates this movie, you should give the series a try, it really is worth it if you like young adult fiction. If you loved the movie, give the series a try, It'll blow your mind. And if you read the series and liked the movie, then we have completely different ideals of what this book could have really lived up too. This series is well know. Not as hot as Twilight of course, but the potential to get people more interested in the series was lost in the first 5 minutes of the movie. I'm a little heartbroken about how they handled this movie and all the opportunities they missed.",1401321600,,1574,4.412371134020619
6198573,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I haven't read the ""Vampire Academy"" series.  Maybe it would have helped to understand what exactly is going on this world.  I'm definitely someone who likes world building.  I want to know the rules, boundaries, and overall history of what's going on in a fantasy world.  The film, Vampire Academy, felt like it was written by two different people.  One wanted to tell a story about vampires, half-vampire body guards, etc and the other wanted a profoundly typical teen movie.  The end result is this mess.  Rose, is a Dhampir, a half-vampire half-human hyrid.  Dhampirs are sworn to protect vampires... for some reason.  I'm not even sure why they need to exist in this world.  They have no supernatural powers.  What exactly makes them especially good at being body guards?  Are all Dhampirs bodyguards?  Do they have a choice?  They movie never explains it.
The vampires in the movie (Rose's voice over makes a point that they don't sparkle) have the ability to,-sort of- bend of the elements.  It's not terribly impressive.  I'm also not sure if each vampire can bend only one element or all elements.  At some point, each vampire has to declare an element.  I don't know why.  Instead of explaining anything, the movie wastes a lot of time introducing pointless side character after pointless side character.  There are also evil vampires, who do evil things, and apparently have some reason to be evil.
The movie doesn't care about explaining any of these things.  It just randomly throws out a minimal amount of information.  They school is named after (was it founded?) by vampire Jesus.  Seriously.  I don't know if Vampire Jesus is the first vampire or the first one to establish rules for their kind.  Either why, we have vampire Jesus.  His name is Vladmir but he's holy and can bring people back from the dead and is the foundation of their religion (I guess he is the foundation as their religion as it is never actually explained).
Aside from confused I was also annoyed at the incredibly fast pace of the character development.  Characters go from friendly to romantic to angry to romantic again.  Lissa (my god was there ever a character/actress with less emotion or personality) flips on a dime.  At times it felt like I was missing entire scenes from the movie, because storylines would abruptly end.
The movie desperately tries to turn Rose into Buffy.  She does okay.  It was distracting trying to understand what reason or motive any of the other characters had.  What was up with the headmistress?  The Queen was weirdly catty and childish?  Seriously, why is the Vampire Queen popping up at a high school?  In full Disney princess costume.  Why is Gabriel Brynes in this movie?
So many questions...",1401321600,,2723,4.818181818181818

6198586,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I doubt that there will be a sequel. According to Wikipedia, this film barely made half of its money back. Budget = $30 million. Box office = $15.39 million. I LOVED the VA books! The Twilight books were fun and I wanted more. This series was IT! Great characters and the plot was different enough from other vampire books, that I read this series in a few days.

On to the film - I wasn't a fan of the casting. The exception being Sarah Hyland as the adorable little sidekick Natalie Dashkov. Awarding winning performance, especially at the end!

I saw this through streaming on Amazon. I don't know if it was an Amazon thing, but I had to adjust the brightness on my laptop to see the darker scenes, and sometimes that didn't work, so I only could tune into voices.

Loving all things Britain and European, I found the accents cringeworthy. Most of the time, they seemed forced, fake and not geographically correct. Needless to say, I was rather disappointed with this offering.

As popular as the books were, I'm surprised that I didn't see more marketing for the film, but I rarely watch ""regular"" TV. Had it been mass marketed, sadly this film still would have sucked (pun intended).",1401235200,,1188,4.589622641509434

It's an adaptation from a book, but the entire premise doesn't make sense.

It doesn't explain anything very good my husband was watching it with me and I basically had to tell him everything. They didn't take the time to do this movie or they didn't really care to.

Vampire Academy, the movie, keeps the great adventure and action, and has great, fast pacing, but at the expense of any kind of character development. Rose's deep sense of loyalty and disdain for the rules when they get in the way of what is really important is bleached into a few witty quips and general rebellion. The other characters - Lissa, Christian, Natalie and Mia -  are relegated to shallow pretty puppets with few apparent thoughts.

Any the chemistry between the actors playing Rose and Dimitri is simply - nonexistant.

It's fun seeing the books come to life, and the casting for Rose and Lissa is spot-on, but I would have preferred a 1/2 hour longer movie for some character development, to this castrated version of a great story.",1401062400,3,870,4.8979591836734695
6198614,3,B00HQOFIA0,"Vampire Academy is based on Richelle Meads bestselling series. The film relates the legend of Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry), two 17-year-old girls who attend St. Vladamirs Academy, a hidden boarding school for Moroi (mortal, peaceful vampires) and Dhampirs (half-vampire/half-human guardians). Rose, a rebellious guardian-in-training, and her best friend, Lissa, a royal vampire princess, escape from the school but are captured and returned to the very place where they believe their lives may be in jeopardy.

Thrust back into the perils of Moroi society and high school, Lissa struggles to reclaim her status while Rose trains with her mentor and love interest, Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky), to guarantee her place as Lissas guardian. Rose will go to any extreme to protect Lissa from those within the Academy walls who intend to exploit her and from the Strigoi (immortal, evil vampires) who hunt her kind from outside its sanctuary.

This is another picture based on young adult fiction that combines teenage angst, romance, and supernatural creatures. Since the Twilight series hit screens, the vampire of legend has been reduced from evil, nocturnal predator to pale-faced fashion-model types. Vampire Academy unimaginatively continues with that portrayal. The acting is mediocre at best and the entire film exudes a profound sense of deja vu.

I wasn't crazy about her at first, simply because Rose is one of my favorite female protagonists ever & that comes with high expectations, but she won me over. She wasn't as badass as the Rose of the books, but her snarky/comedic attitude made up for it. She was the only one out of the cast, besides Victor, that I felt truly connected and represented her character well. It has plenty of action, but was lacking in the romance department. None of the relationships to me felt convincing. Overall, I enjoyed it but didn't love it. As a fan of the books I felt I simply had to watch it, and I'm not too disappointed.

The trailers made the whole concept into a bit of a joke and to be honest, as a fan I was actually a little offended at that. Now I loved the books, but I'm not one of the hard core fans (Just FYI - If you are a hard core fan, I can tell you right now, this movie IS NOT FOR YOU). I liked that the plot line stuck to the book for the most part, and even though the movie changed a few things it was still true to Mead's writing. I personally wouldn't be opposed to a sequel at this point and I plan on purchasing the movie because it was actually decent. I thought some of the writing could have been a bit better (seems as though they changed things to try to keep it current but that just made it a little weird)...it was still a decent movie that was on par with other popular movies of this genre.",1400889600,3,912,3.989071038251366

6198645,1,B00HQOFIA0,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with cntrydaze. I was so excited to see this movie because I loved the book series, but after watching it, I felt extremely disappointing. The book was everything the movie was not.

The Movie:
I know many of you may give me a hard time over the differences between writing a novel and writing a movie, however, even if I had not read the Vampire Academy series, I still would have hated the movie. I like a quality action movie (action, as believable as possible, with a good story plot), but cntrydaze hit the nail on the head when he/she said that the writers and directors turned the book into a huge, pathetic joke of a movie. I was worried the movie would be just that when I first watched the trailer, but several people who had seen the movie, assured potential viewers that it was indeed good, and that it was not going to be one huge joke of a movie. It wasn't. I could not believe how much skipping around Daniel Waters did when he wrote the movie. Of course, in movies, you only have a certain amount of time, so there has to be SOME skipping around, but Waters could not focus on a single aspect of the movie! We were constantly bouncing between scenes, which made it extremely hard to connect with the characters, and would Rose (Zoey Deutch) really be making smarta** remarks while facing down strigoi? Not at all! It was as if I was watching a spoof.

The Actors:
I thought they got the casting down pretty well. Dimitri is not at all what I pictured, but hey, we all come up with different images in our heads. I wish Waters had really focused in on Rose and Dimitri, since they had a great connection together in the books, and it would have been amazing to see it come to life on the big screen.
I felt like Rose could have been a little tougher. Also, I wish she had refrained from making so many smarta** comments, especially during fight scenes, since it jerked me out of the movie as I thought, ""Why would Rose be making a funny comment while fighting? She would be terrified, not snarky."" From what I recall in the books, she was snarky, but it was inside her head. I found the constant narrating extremely irritating, but maybe that is just because I had read the books, and knew most of what they were talking about.
Lissa was okay; not great, not terrible. Christian was good; he was a lot of what I had anticipated, and Mason and Mia were fine. The movie Natalie was great. She was a lot of what I had pictured personality-wise from the books, with her rambling and geeky/awkward personality.
Victor worked for me. He played his part pretty well, and I didn't feel like there was much missing from him.
Kirova, like Dimitri, was not at all what I had pictured. I didn't feel like she was intimidating enough. Richelle Mead had described her as a strict headmistress, but it did not come through much at all in the movie. She was younger and prettier than I had expected, and I think it was her age that made her less intimidating. With a younger headmistress, she will not have as much experience as an older headmistress, and will not have as much practice with giving lectures. I really wished we had been able to hear her lecture to Lissa and Rose upon their return; according to the book, it was one of her best.

Conclusion:
I feel as if the movie did not do the books a single bit of justice. In fact, if I had seen the movie first, I would have never picked up the books. I kept wanting to bang my head against the wall and cry. If I were Richelle Mead, I would be extremely upset, but apparently she--along with many other fans--enjoyed it. In my opinion, this movie was not worth the $13.74 it cost me for the DVD version. I hate to give such a negative review for a movie based on such a good book, but this is how I felt after watching it. My advise is to skip the movie, but buy the books. Hopefully the next movie (if there is another one--fingers crossed it will be written by someone else--) is better.",1400803200,15,3976,4.341397849462366

6198647,3,B00HQOFIA0,"First off I've never read the books, do not intend to.  That said I do enjoy movies.  It was not a bad movie and did a good job of narration to explain everything for those who had not read the books.  It was well acted, well directed and edited well.  The film was geared towards teen girls and is good enough that they would watch it several times.  The story deals with the friendship of two girls at the St. Vladimir Academy.  One is a dhampir ( half-human, half-vampire) who is trained to be a protector of her friend, a full vampire Princess and last of her family lineage.  Together they must find out who is out to get the Princess at the Vampire Academy.",1400803200,,663,4.256
6198648,1,B00HQOFIA0,the previews were better than the actual movie. Only watched 1/2 of it before turning it off. The sarcastic jokes were horrible ...but what was worse was the acting. What a waste of time and money.,1400803200,2,197,4.5
6198649,3,B00HQOFIA0,"In Short: Lyssa, a Moroi (vamp) is the last of the Dragomir family. Her brother and parents died in an earlier car wreck. Rose, Dhampir and Lyssa's bestie, is a stubborn and sometimes reckless guardian. Well, guardian in training. A bond between the two makes her the ideal choice. Rose's near constant chaos makes it hard for others to align her with Lyssa. After a brief escape into the regular world, a few guardians return the duo to Vampire Academy.

So. One of my biggest beefs with the film was Dimitri. Danila Kozlovsky, who played him, was not at all what I had pictured for the character. Not even close. I did read the entire book series in which he is described as being very formidable, calculating and breathtaking. The Kozlovsky version just didn't portray that.

Rose, played by Zoey Deutch, wasn't a very good bad ass either. Rose is head strong, stubborn and opinionated and she herself is a weapon. Zoey lacked conveying these trade mark attributes. She was much more mature in the book too.

Vampire Academy, the movie, was ""meh"" entertainment. Without the actors giving a performance that aligns the characters closer to their true selves, it made the movie another whiny teen vamp film. It could have been much better.",1400803200,,1240,4.785046728971962

6198661,2,B00HQOFIA0,"Perhaps it's due to my age but I honestly am tiring of the teen movies coming out these days. Even in my twenties I enjoyed the films about that age group better than what's coming out now. Movies like THE BREAKFAST CLUB and even SIXTEEN CANDLES told us more about the teens of the day and their problems than this new crop has done. Today it seems that teens can't face normal problems so we place them in danger via vampires or twisted tales of the future. Of the lot only the HUNGER GAMES films have proven worthwhile. Now we have VAMPIRE ACADEMY, based on the best selling series meant for teens. Even that bothers me knowing that teens would rather read this than things more worthwhile.

The story revolves around two friends involved at the Vladamir Academy, the titular location referred to in the title. They live in a world where there is a certain order to vampires. First off is the Moroi, the good vampires, nobles who feed off of willing donors but do not turn them. The Moroi are practitioners of magic involving the elements. They also age and die eventually and aren't as apt to suffer at things like the sun or other folk legends.

Those that do suffer from those maladies are known as the Strigoi. These are ex-Moroi who have drained a human being completely thus turning themselves into savage blood draining killers. These are the vampires that we have come to fear. They do avoid the sun and can only be killed with a silver stake through the heart.

Lastly there are the Dhampir. These are the offspring of a unification of human and Moroi. The Damphir are raised to protect the Moroi from any evil that might befall them, especially attacks from the Strigoi who seem determined to wipe out all traces of the civilized vampire sect.

Now you have the history of the cast of characters in this movie. It's told via narration through Rose (Zoey Deutch), a Dhampir whose best friend also happens to be the next in line for the crown, Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry). Not only are the best friends but the two start the movie on the run, having escaped from the Academy. Somewhere along the line they've become bonded and Rose has the ability at times to see through the eyes of Lissa. They're caught and brought home by Dimitri, the best Dhampir, and his crew. Before entering the Academy they are attacked but survive.

Once they are home the headmistress of the school chastises them for leaving and placing Lissa in great danger. But she's not the worst problem they face. They now have to return to high school and all that entails, including a young Moroi named Mia who has stolen Lissa's old boyfriend and has now set out to destroy Lissa and Rose's reputations. It's cat fight time at school!

As all of this unfolds Rose goes into heavy duty training as a Dhampir. At present she's only a novice, now the time has come for serious training. Between her psychic connection to Lissa and seeing things going on in her life and her attraction to her teacher Dimitri, this isn't going to be easy. It becomes more difficult when strange things begin happening at the school to Lissa including finding dead animals hanging from her door. Someone seems to have their eye set on something dreadful happening to Lissa and now it's up to Rose to find out who.

There were too many things I didn't like about this movie to single one out as the worst. The acting was so-so at best. Even Gabriel Byrne as an aging Moroi doesn't come off well. The sets of the film feel fake at every moment. It's as if any blade of grass was astro turf and all the walls look like stage sets from a high school production.

Perhaps the worst part of this for me was the story itself. It feels so borrowed, so un-fresh as to be spoiled.  The entire story feels as if a number of other teen centered concepts were placed into a blender and turned on high. From TWILIGHT we have vampires, from HARRY POTTER we have a school and from CLUELESS we have the teen girls banding together to take on a common enemy. To think that this has yielded not one but several books frightens me.

The movie ends with a set up for a sequel but I found myself hoping that they didn't make the attempt. I wouldn't want to watch this movie again let alone a sequel. That's saying something because I've always felt that while a first film set up a universe the second always expanded on it. I have no desire to see this one expanded. I don't even think I'll watch this one a second time.

Perhaps, as I said at the start, it has something to do with my age. Maybe if I were a teenage girl this movie would hold some sort of attraction for me. Then again the box office numbers for this movie were so distant from that of TWILIGHT that maybe we're in luck and this will be the one and only film those few fans will have.",1400630400,,4788,4.417233560090703
6198662,3,B00HQOFIA0,"This could have been awesome! But it's average. I liked who was cast (despite the nay-sayers) and the special effects were pretty good for a middle budget film. The editing helped with the story. The lead teen girls had a connection that felt natural. Lots of action, some comedy.

My issue with this film is that it follows the book too closely. How can this be an issue? The key plot & world-building points are introduced by pieces/flashbacks and not in a chronological order. This can be very confusing if someone has not read the book. (Thank goodness I've read the series).

While the production kept many lines from author Rachel Mead (props for that), they did a poor job with explaining her world until after you're about 15 minutes in.  It would have been better if the entire film was done in chronological order of events. Even if they made up a few scenes--introducing the school life first (maybe introduce key characters), explaining how the ""good"" vampires control the elements (but the co-star is unsure of herself & wonders why she's failing to have a single element), why the girl running away (needs to break from book and show the reason so audience understands a huge plot point instead of waiting half-way through the film) and  about what life was outside of the academy (they did some of that).

ALL OF THAT would have been smoother for an explanation for an uninitiated audience. Another example--a random cursed item is introduced as a gift. Even though the editing is well done to hint that it's the item causing behavior, what could have been better is actually hinting that someone is cursing the item and thus the audience gets a hint that the item is what's causing the characters to behave strangely.

This whole film has a very modern TV quality and I am not surprised if many of the tech come from that cinematography background. What do I mean? Deep & mid-focuses everywhere. However, color choices are right-on, and eventually you get used to the style.

Personally, I think Vampire Academy could have been better served by using one of the later books as the plot, however, this film does set the stage for later conflicts.

A good start.",1400630400,2,2176,4.722955145118734
6198663,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I loved these books. Vampire Academy is my second favorite book series, and so I had to give the movie a chance, even though the casting, the trailers, and all of the posters, screamed B-Movie. I saw it anyway. BAD move. Not only was it very far from the book and the acting was catastrophic, but the pacing of the movie was horrible and fast and there was a nonstop flow of dialogue throughout the entire movie! There was never a moment were they weren't talking! I was confused most of the time and I read the books! The casting AWFUL! The Dialogue CRINGE-WORTHY! They changed things, took out things, and added stuff that didn't even happen in the book, (the cave full of Turok-Han *cough cough* uhh I mean strigoi at the end.) plus there was no chemistry what so ever between Rose and Dimitri. In the book they were intense, in the movie they turned them into a joke. Rose went through so much character development in the book, they skipped all of that in the movie, they skipped over half the book in the movie! The Writer and Directer did not understand the book at all. Not to mention Rose Hathaway was described as having tanned skin and ""Semi-exotic desert princess features."" Zoey Deutch didn't remotely fit that description in the slightest! Vampire Academy deserved more than a B-Movie. There is so much more I can say but this is getting kind of long so i'll stop.",1400630400,10,1378,4.516

The actresses and actors overdo it in every scene. By the way, since when do vampires need HUMANS to protect them? WEAK!!! This movie is just soo bad in so many ways, I cannot even give it cool points on any level. For the sake of your time and money. Do NOT watch the movie!

This story is far more than a tween romance, fantasy book about a silly love triangle (no offense Stephanie Meyer). No this story is about a bond between two friends and the trials that they face together growing up whether it be mean girls, love interests or scary principals, the fact that their all vampires and or part vampires is just icing on the cake really.

The themes of social injustice, class wars, and prejudice run deep. If you look at this story separate from the other vampire flicks that have been made in recent years, I think you will enjoy it. People need to stop comparing it to the twilight books and movies because although they are good, this is nothing like them.

A lot of people think this is a movie centered around teenagers, but I'm in my 30s and so is my friend and we both loved it

I read the book years before this movie was released so I was a little nervous as there is good and bad book to movie adaptations, but this one stuck so close to the book I was pleasantry surprised, the actors chosen for this movie were spot on and exactly how I imagined in my head and it was good to not have to put up with a fake russian accent by casting a Russian actor to play Dimitri Belikov.

Most of these actors/actresses were not known to me at all before I saw this movie but because of the fantastic performances in this movie I used IMDB to find all the movies / tv series which they have appeared in.

I pre ordered the did because I loved it! The actors/actresses were greatly chosen and have great chemistry.  I would love for them to make a sequel!

The Vampire Academy BOOK Series: 5 Stars
Vampire Academy MOVIE: 2 1/2 Stars

I don't normally bother with negative reviews but don't waste your money on the movie. Buy the books. I'm not saying this just because changes were made between paper and screen - I'm serious, the movie just pretty much bit the big one. How are all these people giving it so many stars? Is this the beginnings of the Zombie Apocalypse or something? Creepy.

(Honestly, I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I guess that I just kept hoping it would straighten out and get better at some point - no such luck.)

CAST (looks/acting):
Rose - Sort of / okay
Lissa - I can live with it / not impressed
Christian - Pretty close to how I pictured him / I think he could have done more with a better part
Dimitri - (WTF) No Way. Ruins everything that wasn't already wrecked by the crappy Directing and Editing in this movie. Dimitri was WAY HOTTER in my mind and had a much thicker accent. This guy is like a young Jean Claude Van Damme meets Richard Tyson / Not even remotely close.
All supporting cast - Bad acting, terrible.

SPECIAL EFFECTS:
Were there special effects? A few nice kicks. The fight scenes (especially the opening fight) are laughable, at best. Way off target. No guy would appreciate this. No girl over 15 should appreciate this either.
Make-up was terrible. Bad Fangs.
Nothing good to say on this.

SET:
Set was tolerable.

STORY:
RUSHED
The plot suffered, blow after blow. It was so packed with the action scenes that there was no time for any real character development to shine through. It I hadn't read the books I would have been really confused. Instead I'm just disgusted.

BOTTOM LINE:
2 1/2 Stars is generous. If you are determined to watch it, wait until it's a cheap rental. (Like, free with prime or something.)

Now I'm going to go brush my teeth and then stuff myself with chocolate. Hopefully that will get the bad taste out of my mouth.",1400544000,2,1983,4.504178272980502

I am so bummed because it had so much potential to be a fabulous movie! I don't know if they didn't have enough money or what, but it just tanked. Rose was cast perfectly, but Dimitri and Lissa were disappointing. In the books, Dimitri is a tall, manly god, and in the movie, he just looked frumpy.

6198698,3,B00HQOFIA0,"If you can keep the characters and their roles straight - the Moroi are the royalty (mortal vampires who don't kill, but feed only off willing donors), the Dhampir (half human-half vampire) are their guardians, and the Strigoi are those who've actually killed a human and turned insane/evil, intent on turning or killing off the Moroi - and 'Vampire Academy' is a good, light, action comedy-drama that has no problem sucking you in (pun intended) about Dhampir Rose (Zoey Deutsch) and Moroi princess Lissa (Lucy Fry) who are dragged back to St. Vladimir's School, after spending a year on the run, to face an even bigger threat when it looks like someone is stalking Lissa.  Based on a series of YA novels, the film knows when - and, more importantly, when NOT - to take itself seriously, which definitely makes the film more enjoyable (even with a few undeveloped characters in the mix).  Nice job, enough so I'd even watch the sequel the end of this films so wickedly sets you up for ...

Though it didn't follow traditional vamp stories I believe it is one of the best I've ever seen.  It topped Twilight and I really liked that series.  I do hope that the makers of this film continues creating more films in this line; as there is depth in this story that contributes to the overall effect of the film/story.  So as not to be a windbag I'll close with just saying great job as this is a stellar accomplishment in overpowering the same old, same old vamp story line which made for an entertaining event for me.  I guess that this just shows that our imaginations can produce more instead of remaking the same old story with only better cg effects to try and make for better entertainment.
Have fun and do please make more future films in this story line.

Rose steals Lissa, who is also a princess, from the academy as they hide out, only to be discovered and returned to St. Vladimir, the Hogwarts for vampires.

Like the Harry Potter series, in addition to dealing with serious life and death issues, our girls must cope with being a teen and all the puns that go with being a vampire. Yes, the stakes are high. Zoey Deutch gives us a refreshing performance and I haven't been so much in love since Jordana Brewster in D.E.B.S. The plot has some good unveiling.

I wish they could have a do-over or something, because I would pay to go see all five movies if they ever get to come out. My friend and I both wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over. Rose was as sassy as ever, Dimitri was better than expected, and the whole thing was just put to shame with those advertisements...

6198729,1,B00HQOFIA0,"This is one of the most talkative movies I have ever watched. Even during fighting scenes, the fighters talked back and forth non-stop! Because the characters talked too much, I did not have time to think about the movie. There is no time for character development, just talking and talking.

The fighting scenes are acceptable.

There are a couple of scenes with good humor that made me laugh.

The special effects are mixed. In some scenes, they are interesting. In others, they look fake especially the scene with the dead cat.

The film is predictable.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:

Release Date: February 7, 2014
Production Budget: N/A

Domestic:  $7,750,214
+ Foreign:  $1,200,000
= Worldwide:  $8,950,214

So, it is a big flop worldwide. That  faithfully reflects how bad the picture is.

In short, it is not worth it.",1394409600,6,880,4.945205479452055
6198730,4,B00HQOFIA0,"Vampire Academy is my favorite young adult series. This movie adaptation was spot-on. One of the best book-to-screen adaptations I've seen. Way ahead of Twilight, imo. I also was impressed by the casting. The actors ARE their characters. I had a chance to meet Zoey, Lucy, and Dominic at a book signing, and was amazed by how perfect the casting was.
I've also never seen a movie get such divergent views from critics vs. audience. In general, the critics don't get it and hate it, but the audience loves it. I thought they did an excellent job. Read the book first. Then, see the movie. We're all hoping that numerous marketing errors by the producers of the film do not result in not making the next film. Great book series, and has the potential to become a great movie series, as well. So, read it, then see it. You'll want Frostbite, too!",1394409600,5,843,4.552631578947368

I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment and seriously think that the studios are insane if they don't continue this! it's getting RAVE reviews from NORMAL PEOPLE! forget professional critics! forget rotten tomatoes. they NEVER say anything good! i think they get paid to get bad reviews, a reason this movie might is critics can be cruel and petty, and THIS MOVIE REFUSED CRITICS FIRST ACCESS. THEY PREFERRED TO FIRST RELEASE TO GENERAL PUBLIC AND LET THE REVIEWS COME THAT WAY. Critics don't like it. i wonder why?

This movie is by far the BEST book to film adaption i've seen in a VERY LONG TIME. it would be a shame to leave this movie as a stand alone with such rave audience reviews! I can't wait till it comes out on DVD",1394150400,7,1042,4.289340101522843

It was humorous, sassy, sexy, and action-packed, somewhat like the books. I only have two complaints: one, I wish they had taken the time to really clarify some things here and there. Two, and the most important, the development of Rose. Zoey Deuch doesn't physically resemble her all that much (though, now that I think about it, I really have no problem with that), but Rose in the book, is much more protective, head-strong, no BS kind of girl. I didn't really like how she was portrayed in the movie, but I hope that changes if there is a sequel. I think I'm being too critical of Zoey, but since Rose is not only the main character, but she is my personal favorite, I'm not surprised that I have high expectations of her portrayal. Overall, this didn't sway my rating of it. 5 stars, for a reason!",1393977600,5,956,4.406779661016949
6198734,5,B00HQOFIA0,"Vampire Academy came out in theaters February 7th for my State and I went to the earliest possible showing of the movie. Now, before anyone wonders - I HAVE ready the entire VA series and the Bloodlines spin-off series; Vampire Academy was one of those book series that I literally read at least ten times, no joke.

To start off, I think the film turned out wonderful! The major book scenes were present along with fresh new scenes that came together to put Vampire Academy into motion. Now, I'm not say the film was perfect. but I am saying: I think most, if not all, VA fans should give the film a chance. Despite the clips in the movie trailers and other various clips, they cannot do the film any justice. Personally, the trailers seemed to degrade the quality of what the film could have been - along with the green/pink promotional posters. Another thing I believe the film did well was explaining Moroi, Dhampir, and Strigoi. To those new to the series, they have no clue what these different races are so the explanations were a terrific idea.

In Vampire Academy, many of the major scenes made it into the movie: the guardians repossessing Lissa and Rose, the chapel scenes, the lust charm, Jesse and Rose's ""special"" meeting, Strigoi Natalie, Victor's betrays, etc. Those are just a few of the many book- based scenes appearing in the film; yeah, some of Rose's commentary did get a little awkward in parts - but it IS Rose Hathaway we are talking about, she speaks and acts upon impulse. Like all book-to-movie adaptations, there were changes that seemed odd when they are apart of the book series you love. Don't let these new scenes scare you or stop you from seeing the film - they DO go along with the story line.

The few complaints I had were based off technical issues, some scenes felt rushed or out of order which definitely upsets me. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the film and plan to see it again. Why? Because I would love to see Frostbite come to life as well - we get to see Adrian and Eddie for the first time then!!!

I have received questions from friends and other people about my review of the film. Especially when it cam to wondering about ""Why are there Strigoi in the academy and what is all the Strigoi fighting scenes about?"" My simple explanation is that there are NO Strigoi within school boundaries; the guardians encounter them when returning Rose and Lissa back to the academy in the beginning of the film. HOWEVER, there is ONE scene with Strigoi ""attacking"" the academy with Christian Ozera - it is not a real fight, it is a dream.

Please, at least give the film one chance. If you don't like it, then at least you gave it a shot - the actors DID put a lot into making Vampire Academy into what it is, even if we don't like it. But, if you do like it, you have graciously supported the film and will help aid towards Frostbite! Seriously, don't we all what to see the picks for Adrain Ivashkov and Eddie Castile?",1393977600,7,2957,4.488847583643123
6198735,5,B00HQOFIA0,"LOVED the film! I had never read the books prior to watching the movie but understoodwhat was going on. I don't understand why so many moviegoers were confused, it really wasn't a complicated plot. The best part of the film was the AMAZING chemistry between Zoey and Danila (Rose and Dimitri)!!! They're the reason I loved the film so much and after reading the books I love their casting. Zoey is snarky and awesome and Danila is stoic and beautiful as the god Dimitri Belikov.

It's mindbogglingly what a horrible job this film did in theatres especially since it's a lot better of a film then the Twilight series which went on to break records. What's more mind boggling is the studios attempts to destroy any profits or sequels by cancelling screenings in other countries and seemingly purposely destroying this films chances to do better than it's two week showing in the US. I've never seen a movie studio blatantly hurt their own movie and not even try to make a profit or show the film to fans around the world! Here's to hoping that the huge VA fanbase in Australia can make it number one at the box office so maybe there's a chance for sequels which seems more and more unlikely everyday :( I adore the books and would love to see sequels!",1393891200,5,1249,4.551111111111111
6198736,5,B00HQOFIA0,"Critics may have rated this movie low, but I never trusted critics in the first place!! I love the VA books and devoured all six in 3 days, and I am happy to say that the movie follows very closely with the book, which is the telling sign of any good book movie. It had just the right of comedy mixed in with the dramatic moment here and there. Not to mention I LOVE the actors they chose for Rose, Lissa, and Dimitri; Rose was the sarcastic witty kick ass girl I remembered from the books, Lissa was the sweet, kind, yet strong princess, and Dimitri was the super sexy, strong, and noble guardian. They all played their role to perfection. I have already seen this movie three times in theaters, because I just can't get enough of it, I hope they make the rest of the books into movies as well!! :)

6198738,5,B00HQOFIA0,"I am a big fan of Rochelle Mead's writing especially the Vampire Academy series. I know that many people are thinking that this is a Twilight Knock off but trust me it's not. The only similarities between the two are that they are from the  young adult vampire genre. In the world of Vampire Academy there are three different breeds of vampire. The first is the moroi; They are a peace loving mortal people who wield magic in one of the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water and only drink blood from willing donors. They are weakened by sunlight but it will not kill them. There are twelve royal families among the moroi from whom they elect a king or queen. The second breed is called Dhampir: this breed is a hybrid of human and moroi. They are strong and rarely get sick and do not drink blood. The majority of them act as guardians to the moroi against the final breed strigoi. The strigoi are soulless bloodthirsty monsters that drink anyone's blood willing or not. They are extremely strong and while they can drink anyone's blood they prefer the taste of moroi blood and the power it gives them. The moroi and dhampirs go to special schools where moroi learn about magic and dhampirs learn to fight.

  The books and the movie follow the lives of Rose Hathaway a guardian novice and her royal best friend Lissa who is the last in her line. The girls face many obstacles in addition to the normal teenage issues of gossiping and bullying there is something more sinister going on. Someone is after Lissa. As if she doesn't have enough to worry about with her strange powers. Then there is the issue of romance. Lissa falls for a royal outcast and Rose has a thing for her mentor Dimitri and he falls for her too. That's a problem not only because of their age difference but also because they are likely to be Lissa's guardians when the two girls graduate since Rose has a special bond that allows her to see and feel what Lissa does. The movie stuck very close to the book making only minor changes. If you're a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Mortal Instruments, or anything with a kick but female lead see this movie you won't be disappointed.",1392854400,4,2161,4.477157360406092

I know when movies don't do well in theaters, usually means no additional movies, but hopefully I will get lucky and they will continue the series onto film.

6198740,4,B00HQOFIA0,"I haven't read the books.  I watched this because it looked like a good Vampire Movie.  It was, and more.  This story is part supernatural, part coming of age, part political treachery, and part social warfare.  I loved the 3 different types of vampires.

1) The Moroi are the good ones.  They're vampires, but not the undead.  They need blood, but don't kill.  They can endure limited amounts of Sunlight. They're the noble class of Vampires.  I liked how they have powerful magic - over Earth, Air, Fire or Water.

2) The Damphirs are half breeds.  Half Vampire and Half Human.  They're the Guardians of Moroi.  They're sworn to protect the Moroi from the Stregoi.

3) The Strigoi are the Evil Vampires.  They're the undead - No guilt or Pain and Sunlight is lethal.  It was intriguing that not only can the Strigoi turn both Damphirs and Moroi into Strigio, but also that the Moroi can choose to become Strigoi willingly.

The main characters are Rose Hathaway and Lissa Dragomir.  Rose is a Damphir.  Lissa is a Moroi.  They attend the academy together, though their training is quite different.  Lissa is a princess, and has the potential to be more powerful than most Moroi.  Though Rose is still in training she's already Lissa's guardian. They share a special bond.  Emotionally and magically Rose and Lissa are a part of each other.

Vampire fans will enjoy  this.  Metaphorically and literally this movie has Teeth.",1392854400,,1425,4.761316872427984

6198743,4,B00HQOFIA0,"""Vampire Academy"" was a pleasant surprise for this reviewer, who had not read the books or have any idea of what to expect from the movie. It opens with two teenage girls, Rose and Lissa, on the run somewhere in Oregon. In a snappy opening action sequence, we learn several things: the two girls are vampires with a unique bond; they are absent without leave from a vampire academy hidden somewhere in Montana; and there are three types of vampires, each with their own particular place in the world...

Fortunately, the movie takes the first half hour to introduce the characters and the premise to new viewers, before the real story gets underway. The students at Vampire Academy suffer the usual teenage angst, cliques, rivalries, hopes and fears. Their lives are made more complicated by their special powers. Behind that is a dimly seen struggle for power in the vampire realm, a struggle whose dimensions become clear only much later in the story.

The spunky, determined Rose (Zoey Deutch) and princess in waiting Lissa (Lucy Fry) are an excellent pairing, backed by a well-cast group of young actors and adults; it would be hard not to get caught up in their story. The action, suspense and humor are good to excellent. The ending is wide open for sequels. Recommended to fans of the book series and those willing to take the movie on its own merits.",1392422400,,1358,4.75
6198744,5,B00HQOFIA0,"When I first saw the trailer to this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. So when I was watching this movie at my local theater and not being sure whether I would like it or not, I was happy to be pleasantly surprised on how much I really, really liked it. I owned the first 3 books of the Vampire Academy series, but never got around to reading them. But after watching this movie, it really made me want to read them, so I went out and bought the remaining 3 books and decided I was going to read the entire Vampire Academy Series.
  I think the movie was very well done. As I mentioned I never read the book series, but the movie was made so you didn't have to. So I believe fans of the book series and those that have never read them will really enjoy it. I think the actors and the actresses they got to play each of these roles did a superb job. And I enjoyed watching them make their parts their own. I really liked watching the relationship between Rose and Dimitri throughout the movie and seeing it develop from the beginning to the end (I am definitely rooting for Rose and Dimitri as a couple). I also liked seeing the deep friendship between Rose and Lissa, and thinking it was awesome that they had that deep friendship that they were more like sisters. And it really helped that the plot of the story was done really well.
  I really hope the movie did well enough that they do the remaining books in the series, because I would really love to see the characters grow and how each chain of events occur in the series. And though I am reading the series, I would still love to see them all on the big screen.",1392422400,3,1622,4.189102564102564
6198745,5,B00HQOFIA0,"This movie was fantastic. I am a die hard fan of the VA series and can say pretty easily that Richelle Mead is a favorite author of mine. She is an incredible writer, and even though her newest series has a male main character, Mead knows how to write one kick ass female lead and/or heroine. In the YA series Vampire Academy, Rose is that heroine as well as Lissa and other female characters along the way. This was portrayed in the movie, as well as the friendship between Rose and Lissa and the bond (literally and otherwise) they share with one another.

We are given information in the different races within the vampiric world. The Moroi, the Strigoi, and the Moroi's protectors, the Damphir. There are changes in the story that accommodate this information in order to make it more accessible to newcomers and even those who are familiar with the content. The changes that were made were not drastic ones and did not change the story in any way, shape, or form. The only thing that I thought was most imposing was that Natalie was there more than I imagined her in the books. I also remember her being more of a nagging presence and irritating to Rose. But that doesn't mean I don't appreciate the movie portrayal ...I think it opens doorways and previously unthought of direction and ideas to the author and filmmaker alike.

The only thing that can be said about this movie that wasn't done well was the marketing aspect. Not what they showed us, but that they didn't give us enough. You can take any other YA movie that is coming out (Hunger games, Divergent) and just gawk at their promotion in comparison to VA. As well, TWC does not screen for critics (One review I read was actually based around this. He was pissed because he had to pay, ergo, deduct three stars.), not do they have early screenings. You know, those fun Thursday night movies you go to? Also, they scrunched the film to a mere 1 hr 45 min. I loved this movie, but when I read that there was so much more content that was cut down for time that TWC would not budge on, it was kind of heartbreaking.

Really, despite this being an Amazon review, if you have your doubts, don't. Go and support the franchise and give them another chance to make us proud. This movie was great and made me want to go home and open up the books again. To me, if a movie adaptation can get me wanting to go back and re-read its book counterpart because I enjoyed it onscreen that much, it is a success.

So go see it at the movies, ore-order it. And if you haven't for some reason, the books are incredible, too. If you haven't read them, you get to meet Adrian soon. There is a reason he's a favorite amongst the gals of this series.",1392336000,5,2693,4.390781563126253
6198746,5,B00HQOFIA0,I've read all the books and was very happy the book was pretty true to the book. I think both readers and not readers of the v.a. series would like this movie. This is also the only vampire movie I know of that my husband actually liked.,1392163200,,237,4.0638297872340425
6198747,1,B00HQOFIA0,"I saw the film yesterday. I was one of three people in the movie theatre. I never read the books and I am not a fan of the genre. But my main draw for seeing it was due to seeing Zoey Deutch in the trailer. She really reminded me of one of my favourite superhero's X-23.  I found the start of the film to be confusing. It reminded me of a cross between Underworld and Harry Potter.

Ostensibly the film was about three clans of vampires and their protectors, residing at a boarding school that trains vampires. As expected there is a lot of in-fighting and turf wars between the characters. For both real and perceived power. Lissa is a vampire princess with royal blood who is in line to be head of the Vampire world. Rose is her friend and protector.  That being said, I found the film to be boring. The last 20 minutes was fun, but beyond that I was pretty bored.

I did like the two heroines Rose and Lissa. Played by Zoey Deutch and Lucy Fry. I especially liked Fry. I was impressed by her graciousness and kindness. It was nice to see a teenage girl behave like a lady for a change.

In all it was a boring film and I can't recommend it to anyone.",1392163200,7,1153,4.175675675675675
6198748,5,B00HQOFIA0,"This was a really great movie adaptation, obviously no adaptation is perfect but it really captured Lissa and Rose's friendship.

6198749,5,B00HQOFIA0,"Considering that the Vampire Academy Series is definitely a top contender for my favorite YA series ever, I had high expectations going into this movie-that is not to say, however, that I thought it needed to be identical in every detail to the book. Sometimes you go to see a movie because it is groundbreaking or monumentous....and other times you just want a chance to see the characters you love come to life on screen. It is impossible to create a perfect adaption of a book because literature and film are completely different mediums-they tell a story in completely different ways.

I found the movie to be a great representation of the book. That doesn't mean it doesn't have its problems, it does. But for those willing to sit back and just enjoy it for what it is....I think you will find that it just might surprise you after all. Not every movie needs to be an Oscar contender to be valued and not every movie has to be ""great"" to be Great.",1392163200,2,952,4.502890173410405

I was pleasantly surprised at how well they captured what Richelle Mead was trying to do in her story.  It has mystery, drama, suspense, comedy, and action just like the books.  It cannot be pigeon-holed into one category.  This movie truly has everything.  That being said, it is at its essence a story about friendship and loyalty and the Waters brothers did not lose focus of that.  Deutch really delivers as Rose with her wit and bravado underscored by inner turmoil and Fry captures the princess instability perfectly.  Danila Kozlovsky as Dimitri makes you want to swoon in every scene hes in and Sarah Hyland does an amazing performance as Natalie.  Truly, the entire cast made the movie from the smallest part to the leads.  They captured all of the drama that the first book delivers as the characters are beginning to come to terms with their bond and the consequences of it.  But it isn't all teenage angst.  It has humor, budding romance, and plenty of action.  For fans of the book, they won't be disappointed in how faithful the movie is not only to the essence of the story but also in the inclusion of many familiar scenes.  Though some parts were changed around a bit and a few new scenes added, it was done to the benefit of the viewer and in no way lessened the experience. I was especially excited with the ending because of a surprise scene that Romitri fans should enjoy and also because they left open a possibility for future movies.  They alluded to what is to come and made me look forward to seeing the rest of the story unfold onscreen.

6198754,5,B00HQOFIA0,"With the trailers hitting the airwaves for this movie I had very little interest in going to see that movie. To be brutally honest if I were going by the trailers I would have waited till it hit T.V. before seeing the movie, had I done that it would have been a huge mistake. But I had to show my support for Richelle Meade, I have been entranced by her books since I first read them four years ago. Every time I would get my desperate claws into one of the Vampire Academy books I physically couldn't put the book down till I read the whole book. Bloodline series is also incredibly well written. Vampire Academy is one of those movies that gets better with every viewing. The cast is perfect for the roles they were cast in. Zoey Deutch (Rose Hathaway) is perfect, she looks the part and she certainly acts it. She looks perfect with Danila Kozlovsky (Dimitri Belikov) who brought to life Dimitri perfectly. Though I would have liked. To see more dialogue with him. Lucy Fry (Lissa Dragomir) embodies her character beautifully, she acts like a queen while still being relatable. Make no mistake this movie could not have in anyway be mistaken for Twilight, Mean Girls, Buffy or any other vampire movie. The true purpose of the movie is friendship and the length your willing to go to protect those you care about. Vampire Academy has not been given a chance from the word go. The trailers made it look like a cheesy Twilight Mean Girls mess. The release in the US and Canada was wrong, making it compete with The Legos Movie really hurt this movies success in the box office. Really people give this movie a chance you will be glad you did.",1392076800,4,1642,4.476666666666667
6198755,5,B00HQOFIA0,"I read the series by Richelle Mead several years ago and absolutely fell in love. I don't remember every last detail of the series, but I must say I really enjoyed this movie based on its own merits. It was sassy, funny, badass, and never had a slow moment. It wasn't confusing at all, everything made sense to me and this is from someone who doesn't really remember everything about the first book. I wasn't sure about the casting before I saw the movie, but after seeing the movie I truly believe they got as close as I've ever seen a book to film adaptation get to having actors who excelled at capturing the spirit of the characters. People have to realize that a book series doesn't reveal all in the first book, nor will it reveal all in the first movie. Adapting a book into a movie is never perfect, but this movie was not only a good movie but was a good representation of the book series. Vampire Academy deserves to have a second movie and people will agree if they go see it!",1392076800,3,987,4.311827956989247
6198756,5,B00HQOFIA0,The movie was amazing I have never seen a movie so close to the book.  Fans of the books won't be disappointed even people who have never read the books will enjoy this movie.  It's nothing like twilight.  This movie has a bad ass female not an omg save me please one.  Rose is not your typical leading lady!  So please go out and see it the next books are even better and we want them in movie format too!!!,1392076800,,408,4.05
6198757,5,B00HQOFIA0,"From the preview of this movie it may just seem like silly teen vampire movie, but its not. Vampire academy based off of rochelle mead's 2007 book after the same name was a great movie. there is a little something for everyone. Action for the boys, romance for the girls and humor for everyone!! I absolutely loved it and think they did a great job adapting the book to fit the movie. I would encourage everyone to at least give it a try because its worth it!",1392076800,2,459,4.287356321839081
6198758,5,B00HQOFIA0,I am a huge fan of this book series and I thought that the film stayed pretty true to the book. I loved the film!,1392076800,,113,3.56
6198759,5,B00HQOFIA0,"Vampire Academy is NOT a twilight knockoff. It was actually out before Twilight was written. Vampire Academy, in my opinion as a Twilight fan, is a million times better than Twilight. There are vampires, there is magic, there is a school. So yes, I can see how people compare it to Harry Potter and Twilight, but it's nothing like them.

The movie is AMAZING. One of the best book to movie adaptations I have ever seen. I know many fans were scared to see the movie because of the trailers that were put out. But I can promise you, the movie was nothing like the trailers. Way better than the trailers. Zoey as Rose was perfection. Danila as Dimitri was amazing. The chemistry? Perfection. I almost died when he said Roza. Especially in that ONE scene.. I won't say EXACTLY what he said, because I didn't expect those words to come out of his mouth, but they did! And they made my heart skip a beat. My breath caught and I thought I was gonna die. It was magic.

You must go see the movie! It was amazing and I can't wait to buy the movie!",1392076800,2,1039,4.295918367346939
6198760,5,B00HQOFIA0,"My Dad and I saw this movie on opening day and it was terrific!  Even my Dad enjoyed it.  I've read the book and I thought that the movie was right on track with it.  This movie has action, humor, sexiness, smarts, an excellent soundtrack, and (of course) some blood sucking.  What more could you ask for?
I can't believe that Amazon already has this movie available for pre-order.  I will be ordering my own copy very soon.  I definitely recommend this movie.",1391904000,3,460,4.481927710843373
6198761,5,B00HQOFIA0,"A friend introduced me to the VA book series a few years ago.  I've read the books several times since then, and consider it one of my favorite book series.  Needless to say, I was very excited when I heard they were making a movie.

I don't agree with all of the marketing decisions made by the distributers, but kept an open mind and decided as a true VA fan, I definitely had to give it a chance.  What I loved about the books is there is there is action, suspense, romance and it is all wrapped with a sarcastic witty humor of the main character, Rose.

I went on opening night with another book lover, and three additional friends who had not read the books.  All five of us loved the movie!!

Pros:
The casting was surprisingly well done.  Zoey Deutch delivered a perfect performance of Rose Hathaway, with well timed lines and emotion. Danila Kozlovsky was a smart choice - his authentic Russian accent and subtle command of over scenes was great.  Though as small part, Claire Foy as Karp was a loveable and believable nut. I could go into each cast member, but I'll save that.  There may not be any Oscar performances in this movie, but each person was a believable character, which was all that I asked. They ""felt"" right.

While the official trailer made it look like comedy was the main focus of this movie, thankfully it was not!  Don't get me wrong, this movie does not take itself too seriously and there were added jokes, but it was balanced well with action, friendship, drama and even some romance.  However, unlike most YA stories, the romance in this book/movie is not running the show.  And that is alright.  I found myself laughing out loud several times, gripping my seat on occasion and genuinely smiling as the chemistry played between the lead couples.

For those that are book fans, they really did stay true to the book.  Most of the main scenes were there (see cons below). There was some re-ordering and a few added scenes, but I feel they enhanced the movie keeping it flowing and helping new comers get a grasp on background information. This was probably the closest adaptation of a book I have seen.

Cons:
The pacing of the movie was a bit fast for my taste.  They did make an effort to keep all book lovers favorite scenes, and while appreciated, they jumped from scene to scene pretty quickly to accomplish this. I would have loved the movie to be 15 minutes longer and let some parts marinade a little more.

I want more... Con for me, Pro for the movie! :)

As I mentioned above, the marketing for this movie left something to be desired.  With all the pink and green, tag line of ""They Suck at School"" and toting that it was a Vampire 'Mean Girls', it's a no wonder it did not draw a big audience the first day.  While I may think it could work on pre-teens, that is a very small demographic.  There is a lot in this story to appeal to a much bigger audience - and does! (I'm not in the target demographic) I can only hope this series goes on to be successful, as the books get dramatically better after the first.  I would love to see further adaptions.

Honestly, give it a try!",1391904000,3,3120,4.410839160839161
6198762,5,B00HQOFIA0,"After seeing the first few trailers, I honestly expected the movie to be cheesy and not stay true to the books. After seeing the movie twice now (in two days), I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with how well the adaption stayed true to the books. Parts of it were funny, other parts were a bit odd, but overall, it felt like the novel. If you liked the books, you should enjoy the movie. There were a few things added to the movie, which added surprise and intrigue for those who have read the books, as well as a few things they left out that I really WISH had been in there (like more Rometri). Again, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie! I want to see it again! I really hope they continue on with the series and make Frostbite. Looking forward to owning it so I can watch it many more times! :)",1391904000,,808,4.1528662420382165

6198764,4,B00HQOFIA0,"Yesterday I went to see vampire academy. And yes I am a boy ( not ashamed ). It was a very good movie. And to throw in the girl from ""Modern Family"" was genius. She was very funny including her licking blood of a wall. Since it ended with a cliffhanger I would think it would have a sequel because of all the books but I don't know I guess well have to wait and see what the future holds. People buy this movie off of amazon you couldn't get a better deal.",1391817600,14,456,3.913978494623656
6198765,1,B00HQOFIA0,"Based on the novels by Richelle Mead and directed by Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, Mean Girls), Vampire Academy stars Zoey Deutch as Rose Hathaway a half human/half vampire guardian in training that has bonded and been entrusted to protect her best friend and vampire princess, Lissa (Lucy Fry).  After being on the run, the girls are eventually found and returned to the academy by one of the schools guardians, Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky).

Back on school grounds, the girls face dirty looks and ridicule from their peers.  Almost immediately, the girls are faced with numerous threats and are uneasy about certain individuals  including a secretive vampire, Christian (Dominic Sherwood), a fellow classmate with a grudge, Mia (Sami Gayle)  not to mention the unpredictable headmaster, Ellen (Olga Kurylenko).  Fortunately, Rose also has the ability to see through the eyes of Lissas eyes and has the ability to be at her side in a moments notice.

Theres no hiding the fact that someone is out to get Lissa  but nobody seems to be able to figure out the particular reason.  At the same time, there is a threat looming from outside the gate from a different group of vampires  who are notoriously bloodthirsty.  A mystery shrouds the academy and Rose must do all she can to train and prepare herself  with the help of her new instructor, Dimitri  to protect Lissa from any and all impending threats.

Please (and Im begging when I say this)  someone explain to me why every time a new supernatural teenager flick gets released, it feels like Ive already seen it five times before.  Seriously, this is getting pretty ridiculous.  Is it beyond the ability of authors to come up with fresh ideas?  Is this seriously the future of entertainment?  Twilight is apparently ancient history now  even though the final film of the franchise was released in late 2012 and Harry Potter a year before that  so here we are with essentially the same old thing again.  How would I best describe the newest attempt at stealing peoples money using other peoples ideas?  Well, Id describe Vampire Academy as what would happen if you took Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Twilight and put them all in a blender.

Since 1997, there has been 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 5 seasons of Angel, going on 7 seasons of True Blood, and currently 5 seasons of Vampire Diaries.  With that being said  anyone that makes the claim that Vampire Academy isn't a knock-off of any one of those TV shows (and we haven't even gotten to the movies yet) is correct.  Instead, its a collaborative take on washed-up story thats been told several times before, told some more, and then told a bunch more times after that.  The characters in Vampire Academy are no more fresh or authentic than a stinky pair of 17-year-old gym shoes.

Even though the plot of this film is horribly predictable and about as mysterious as a dog playing fetch, the acting of Zoey Deutch is undeniably commendable.  At first, she comes off a bit overbearing with the amount of chatter she rattles off in the opening scenes, but she will quickly win you over.  Not unlike Kat Dennings from the comedy 2 Broke Girls, Deutch possesses an endless amount of charisma  not to mention her ability to nail sarcasm is utterly perfect.  Unfortunately, outside of Deutchs ambitious performance (and Id say her choreography/fighting skills could use some work), the rest of her cast-mates fall completely flat and fail to garner any interest whatsoever.  Apparently, vampires are mostly Russian, though.

If you're like me and you don't wonder into the young adult section of the book store very often (or ever), the Vampire Academy series is comprised of six novels that author Richelle Mead cranked out in roughly three years.  While thats all fine and dandy for Mead (who no doubt cashed in after selling 8 million copies), if this first film doesnt translate well to moviegoers (and theres no indication it will), this will be yet another novel-to-film series that crashes and burns.  It would join recent disappoints that include the film adaptations of Beautiful Creatures, The Host, I Am Number Four and Enders Game  and to some degree Percy Jackson.

Overall, Vampire Academys title basically tells you all you need to know about the film.  Its literally a bunch of young adults that go to school (no, its not Hogworts  although if this group of ""Scoobies"" ran into the Harry Potter clan, nobody would complain) for mystical training  which is messed in with a business-as-usual love subplot.  For whatever reason, books of this nature fly of the shelves, even despite the fact that they recycle the same old storyline.  While the star of the film, Zoey Deutch, could potentially have a bright future, its highly unlikely shell have to worry about doing very many more Vampire Academy films.  There is simply not enough here to warrant more, mostly because of the indisputable resemblance of Harry Potter and Twilight.  Fans of the book franchise will likely come to the films defense, but everyone else should feel free to move along to something far less generic and unimaginative.
