2663894,1,B000ION780,"""The Mad"" has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The editing was so bad that I truly expected to hear the director yelling directions before the actors began moving. The premise was idiotic, the acting was not even passable for a high school improvisational team and the complete lack of caring that seemed to go into the entire production even further diminished any potential there may have been.

2663902,1,B000ION780,The movie was ridiculously stupid. I didn't even finish watching it.

2663914,2,B000ION780,"Monsters of another sort, the result of bad beef that has been tampered with by a desperate farmer who does receive his just deserts later rather than sooner.  The Mad isn't a zombie movie, however much it tries to take advantage of the confusion.  ""The Mad"" are people who have eaten tainted beef and as a result, they automatically turn into blood thirsty killers and partakers of human flesh.  The gore is substantial.  It is, however, played entirely for laughs.  This is less a horror film, more a messy comedy about a doctor (Billy Zane) who spends the bulk of the film muttering his lines and purposely adding uncertainty about whether he's a real doctor or a former musician in an 80's rock band.  The joke wears thin immediately, yet is endlessly repeated in the hope that it may prove funny through sheer repetition alone.  The plot takes its good natured time getting to the point as we're first forced to watch endless bickering between dad and daughter, daughter and faux stepmom, dad and daughter's dopey boyfriend.  They stop for lunch in the middle of nowhere at a fair of some sort.  They plan to spend the night at the ""Backwoods Bed & Breakfast.""  The endless yapping between these four people concerns sex, music, and ""don't call me cupcake.""  They try to deliver all their lines deadpan, as though mass murder happening around them was just an annoying inconvenience.  They will not be deterred from their bickering.  If you enjoy this type of humor, eureka, there's a lot of it.  And this is before they meet ""the quiet inbred farmer type.""",1427328000,2,1562,4.715867158671586

  This quirky movie is a little known gem with Billy Zane in it.  I generally go ""eh"" when I hear a movie with him in it.  But Zane really has a great thing when it comes to playing qurky type characters.  And this movie he plays it to the hilt.
  When Zane's character takes his girlfriend and his daughter & her boyfriend on a trip to get to know his daughter better, hillarity results.  They stop at a small town diner to eat, when a ""Zombie Outbreak"" happens.  From there comedy happens.
  I love watching this film & just having a good laugh.  And what horror monster is better than a Zombie to put in a comedy?  I can't think of one that works well",1393804800,,880,4.18562874251497

After recently watching a string of zombie movies that cannot be easily squeezed into the standard zombie-movie mold (""Undead,"" ""Last of the Living,"" ""Days of Darkness,"" ""Dead Meat""), I can now add to it a zombie/comedy that also sits outside the box.  ""The Mad"" is surreal in its execution - from the infra-red look of the scenery to the consumerism of the zombies to the off-the-wall characters and on up to the exquisite absent-mindedness of Billy Zane's character.  And, best of all, it works.  Together, these elements produce a tapestry as funny, as scary and as creepy as any zombie movie I've ever seen.  The only let-down is that the mad cows do not rampage; they merely push one another aside to get to the special feed the farmer has given them; but, to make up for it, the meat patties they produce do rampage.  Truly, this movie acts out The Smiths' signature song ""Meat Is Murder"" (of course, that song is nowhere to be found in the film, but it's there in spirit).",1306627200,,1012,4.594444444444444

This is a fun, silly zombie film, along the lines of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but not quite as good.  It's definitely not for those who take horror movies seriously.  In fact, I think this is a spoof on serious zombie films.
  Zane is OK, but I think he was miscast - anyway, I wasn't convinced he was a doctor. Fortunately, he doesn't ruin the fun.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, they're perfect.  This is not the kind of movie that would benefit from Academy Award winning performances and all these actors understand exactly what the film needs from them, and they deliver.
  Not extremely scary or gory, but still, probably not for the squeamish.  The cover art is scarier than the movie itself.
  I would have given this movie 3 and a half stars, if I could have, but couldn't go the full 4 stars.  If you enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead,"" cut this one a little slack and have a ""bloody"" good time.",1289606400,2,1033,4.295336787564767
2663926,4,B000ION780,"Billy Zane played one of those dads who trys to be cool and hip around their kids so they can stay close as the kids get older. But he didn't expect to encounter zombies, this movie was cool, a lot of directors should go this route when making a zombie movie.  When in doubt, make a ""ZOMEDY"" the drawn out dialogue was pretty funny.  Only down side for me, was that when the movie ended I kinda wanted more.",1284768000,,407,4.139240506329114
2663927,2,B000ION780,The Mad is a bad film. No question about it. I had heard it was bad because it included man eating hamburger patties. That isn't the half of it. It isn't the half of it either that Billy Zane plays the part as if he is sneering at the production. The acting by adults is even OK; and I would label the idea of zombies produced by a mad cow-like disease as pretty good. What makes the movie truly bad is a stream of consciousness script that often disconnects totally from the plot. I remember one scene in particular where Billy Zane and his daughter alternated between talking about their relationship and fighting zombies. There are a number of scenes like that. So see The Mad but be forwarned.,1282435200,,697,4.410852713178294

2663931,1,B000ION780,"I believe Billy Zane either knew someone involved with this movie, or he was very desperate for money. This movie was not entertaining in the least.. I don't see where anyone found this funny. If your sense of humor is all about people wading through zombies holding monotone conversation and cracking flat jokes, then your ready to split a rib here. But I for one felt like the script was written in about two hours by someone with very, very, very poor writing skills. Billy Zane and company stroll through the story babbling and mumbling, while they split zombie heads and even tango with them. Meanwhile, growth hormones bring beef patties to life and they attack people like the blob. I hope the person who wrote this script never works in Hollywood again.. It is really that bad. Any idiot with a quarter of a brain could probably write something better than this. I actually dozed during this DVD.. and never in my life have I fell asleep during a movie.

2663935,4,B000ION780,"Maybe I'm being about a half star too generous with the flick, but then again maybe I'm not because after all it does have Billy Zane in it and I do love me some Billy Zane. Here he's the absolute antithesis of the amped up character he played in DEMON KNIGHT but it still works. Zane plays a rather quite, restrained medical doctor who is vacationing with his daughter Amy (Maggie Castle), her boyfried, and his own prospective second wife Monica (Shauna MacDonald) who is very much at odds with teenage Amy. Against his better judgment they stop at a small town where some sort of country fair seems to be taking place, his girlfriend read an article about the town in which it was referred to as ""hillbilly nouveau""--very chic apparently, so there's no getting out of it.

What none of them know however, is that the $16.95 hamburger special made from local ""free range"" cattle is not what it seems and before long everybody who has eaten one is foaming at the mouth and attacking all those who haven't. Naturally this brings up the discussion of whether or not they are really zombies or not--a subject they decide to leave for another time.  Ultimately they learn that all the tainted meat came from one area farm and they decide that some course of action should be taken, and all sorts of bloody comic mayhem ensues. There is one especially funny scene involving father/daughter bonding as they casually fight for their lives in a field of zombies that can justifiably be called classic.

Written by Kevin Hennelly and directed by John Kalagis, THE MAD has a few new twists to offer the genre if only in the form of characterization. Haven't you always wanted to see at least ONE person keep their head on straight and think rationally during a zombie attack? Well Zane's your boy. He's virtually unflappable, even going so far as to discuss with  Monica what dress she should be buried in as he performs an autopsy on her to see if he can learn more about the disease that's infecting everyone! Sure this flick isn't perfect but when you have scenes like that you have to love it.",1254096000,5,2088,4.589812332439679
2663936,4,B000ION780,"THE MAD concerns a family vacation interupted by a hamburger-induced zombie invasion. Billy Zane (Critters, Dead Calm, Memory) plays the dad who must face the hideous horde w/ the help of his daughter, her boyfriend, and a few other survivors. The first half is my favorite, as Zane and company are hilarious. Things drag a bit in the mid-section, but there are enough funny parts to keep things rolling. Besides, how often do you get a chance to see a hamburger patty crawl around, bubble green goo, and fly onto someone's face?...",1241740800,2,532,4.793478260869565

2663939,5,B000ION780,"THE MAD

I have to say that this ranks way up there with any zombie movie I have ever seen, particularly the comedy ones. I don't think it would be my favorite but it is up there with them for sure, more of a tongue n check type film. There is a lot of intellectual humor in this film and the performances feel real, which usually does not happen.  This is the type of film that you would watch with some close friends on a weekend night expecting something really bad, but to your surprise you would actually end up liking. If that has happened to you lately chances are you were watching this movie. This is a campy, fun, and humorous film that really should have caught on better, I think it will eventually become something of a cult classic.

Writer/director/producer John Kalangis and co-writers Kevin Hennelly have written a very funny yet intellectual piece, well as far as a zombie movie goes. The film moves at a nice pace and has a lot of good moments through out, good gore scenes as well. While there is a lot of good laughs to be had with just words and facial expressions there are some good laughs based off of some of the gory zombie moments.  One headless moment in particular is a personal favorite of mine I am sure you will like it as well, of course there are other great moments. But the film makers balance things out nicely with a mix of horror and humor although I thought this film was straight hilarious, so maybe more so on the humor side of things. A scene involving Billy Zane were he tells his daughters boyfriend to watch his mouth about his now dead girl friend is probably one of the funniest scenes in the film.

Acting wise this film is top notch and I can't really complain about anybody that was in front of the camera on this flick. Billy Zane was absolutely perfect in his role of the dad that is with a new woman that his daughter disapproves of and feels is trying to change her father. I have always been a big fan of Billy Zane and he was always one of my favorite actors ever [his performance in ""Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight"" is still far and above excellent]. His dry wit and delivery of the character is perfect and I can't wait to see him in this genre again. Maggie Castle is real good as his daughter although her character may drive you crazy at first, and every other actor in this film is just as good as the ones mentioned above. It seems every person involved really came onto this film to create a great movie.

Over all this is an excellent film that I would recommend to every one that reads this, I found it really entertaining. This is a really funny movie and if you enjoyed other zombie comedies I am sure you will like this one as well. Of course any time a guy [who is a doctor] straps on some gloves to cut up his dead girl friend [who was just killed by screwdriver or knife to the head and munched on by some zombies] and examine her and says ""She always supported my career"" will always be a classic in my eyes.",1225756800,3,2987,4.268551236749117
2663940,5,B000ION780,"Billy Zane is hilarious in this funny horror feast. Okay its simple, Billy zane, zombies (or mad cow people)and a pretty funny script gets you an enjoyable movie.",1224720000,,162,4.821428571428571
2663941,4,B000ION780,"The Mad (John Kalangis, 2007)

It seems a lot of people hated Kalangis' third feature film (following Jack and Jill and Love Is Work); I can kind of understand why, but I'm certainly not one of them. I found The Mad to be a brilliant send-up of the current zombie-movie craze, delivering as many stupid laughs per minute as Kalangis, Kevin Hennelly, and Christopher Smets could jam into their screenplay. Yeah, it's dumb-- that's the whole point.

The Mad is about a family-to-be-- father Jason Hunt (Billy Zane), daughter Amy Hunt (Maggie Castle), Jason's fiancee Monica Tepper (Shauna McDonald), and Amy's somewhat slow boyfriend Blake (Evan Charles Flock). At Monica's insistence, they stop at a ""nouveau hillbilly"" resort near a farm whose ""organic"" meat is anything but. Needless to say, the burger special at the resort's diner is the cause of all the anarchy to come; after some wonderful parodies of Lifetime Original Movie-style stepmother-attempting-to-bond-with-teen-who-doesn't-like-her and the like, those who ate the burgers go insane (Note that, like such recent ""zombie"" movies as 28 Days Later..., the ""zombies"" here are not actual zombies.), leaving our family unit, the diner owner (Rothaford Gray), and his daughter Steve (Jordan Madley) to figure out what's going on and get to the bottom of things.

I've read a few reviews that get all up in arms about Billy Zane's character's lack of reaction to the events that go on around him. But, you see, that's what it's all about; a horde of zombies attacking him isn't nearly as important to him as is bonding with his daughter. The zombies are just a problem to be solved pragmatically. I've been dying for a movie to have a protagonist like that for years. You don't really think that in an age when everyone and his mother has seen dozens of zombie films, we're all going to be running around like chickens with our heads cut off when the dead rise from their graves, do you? Of course not, we're going to go out and stock up on guns, ammo, and machetes, and put the wandering [censored for Amazon consumption] back in their graves, that's what we're going to do. Just think of Jason Hunt as an advance wave of zombie fighters-- the new guard, as it were.

Of course, that doesn't mean the dichotomy can't be squeezed for its humor value; there's still a cognitive dissonance in ""oh, yeah, a zombie. Now, you know Blake's just not your type, right?"". The screenwriters milked it for all it's worth, and I thought they did a fantastic job of it. Don't take it seriously and you'll have a fabulous time with this overlooked gem. ****",1212105600,,2601,4.8120805369127515

I gave this a try mainly because of Billy Zane, and because i like Zombie movies, but this movie was a real let down and it kept me wondering why would Zane agree to act in a movie like this.
The plot was stupid, about Mad cow disease truning people into zombies, and as one reviewer before mentioned that one of the silliest things is when the actual beef patties and the uncoocked beef starts attacking humans, that was really stupid.
The script was also bad, it was meant to be funny, but it felt more silly than funny, and characters in the movie acted in a very unrealistic way,
I know this movie was meant to be funny and a parody of zombie movies, but it failed at that and ended up being a Mad, i mean a Bad movie..just save your money for something better..",1195344000,2,877,4.226190476190476
2663944,3,B000ION780,"1) ACTING--No problems here. Everyone here can act and there were no big stand outs when it came to bad actors. Billy Zane seemed to really have fun doing this movie, and it makes ya wonder how much of his character was scripted and how much of it was him, ""hamming"" it up. A lot of character development in this movie and the actors all seemed to enjoy doing the ""slapstick"" in this movie.

2) MAKE UP & SPECIAL EFFECTS--No issues here. A good amount of blood and gore is thrown around and the zombies look pretty good. Speaking of zombies...

3) THE ZOMBIES--Nothing new to see here. Good makeup, minimal use of the ""white faced, raccoon eyed zombie make up that seems to be in abundance nowadays. The zombies aren't runners, but they are very aggresive when attempting to chow on various peoples.

4) THE CAUSE--This is our little morality lesson for the day. The farmer that provides the beef to the town is using some very un-organic chemicals to fatten the livestock so he gets more money for his produce and gets away with it, due to some loophole in the USDA's guidelines. Anyone who eats any of his tainted meat begins their transformation into a blood-thirsty zombie. Usually, it's the big corporation taking advantage of the little business guy trying to hold his own, but this time, it's just one guy (and his son) out to make a quick buck at the expense of others. The survivors feel they need to make this situation ""right"" and head off to the farm where it all began to stop it all, instead of just hightailing it out of town.

5) SOUNDTRACK--Done by a Canadian group named Half Past Four. The movie ends up with a fun 1980's sound, but when the bass begins, it's turned up so obnoxiously loud and forces you to grab the remote control to try and balance out the music in between the talking and regular chomp fests. No heavy metal thrash, though.

6) CONTINUITY--Only one real thing stood out. Near the end, when Jason turns the lights on at the farm, the plaster on Johnny's forehead is gone, leaving his wound visable. A little bit later, it has reappeared covering up the wound again.

Overall, a fun little entry in the ""zomedy"" genre, in the same vein as Shaun of the Dead. (SofD was Much better) It's not incredible, but at least worthy of a rental.

2663945,4,B000ION780,"A doctor (Billy Zane) and his family stop in a small town during a festival.  This was a mistake.  Underneath the charm of small-town living a strange horror is about to burst forth.  Tainted meat is going to affect the locals and turn them into zombies (or are they zombies?).  Whatever they are, the crazed killers very quickly outnumber the unaffected.  Zane quickly becomes the leader of the survivors.  As they are besieged by the mad killers they work up a plan of escape and how to stop the menace from spreading.  Will they succeed?  Who will survive?

This is a tongue-in-cheek movie that works well on the absurd and comedy levels but is not really scary.  But then scary was not really the goal of this film.  Billy Zane is excellent and at his deadpan best as a doctor trying to deal with family, vacation, zombies, and killer hamburgers.  If you thought a killer dessert topping was wild (The Stuff) then you will get a real kick out of marauding cuts of meat.  Creative cinematography really helps drive the movie while blood and guts take only a minor role.  If you are looking for a horror spoof then check this one out.",1193616000,18,1136,4.532019704433497

It's not taking itself to seriously with good results. I thought Billy Zane was especially entertaining, clever dialog overall.  I actually laughed out loud a few times, not a common occurrence. It's probably going to be panned by most serious horror enthusiast, which I consider myself to be one of but I enjoyed it and would recommend.",1507852800,,483,4.865853658536586
