Our young daughter had an imaginary wolf who ran with her for years afterward.  Sadly, the tape went the way of all  homemade tapes, and I find I can't replace it today.  This is an excellent  movie with a fine moral:  don't stop loving your family and never give up  on them.  There is adventure, danger and pathos enough to keep even the  adults in the family satisfied.  It is an excellent movie and I'd buy four  copies if I could find it.",950572800,5,551,4.10377358490566

714990,3,6303675387,"Let me clarify the three stars-- it'd be five stars-- loved, loved, loved it as a kid-- but wow. It's so, so political.  It's amazing to re-watch old films I loved as a kid and to see the propaganda the Michael Eisner Disney machine decided to throw in.  It's a great film about self determination, but they just couldn't resist throwing in stuff about socialism, communism, and the ""Main Streeters"" who pretend to be good but are really actually amoral bad people who burn out shanty towns.  As a history major and lover, I know that there was some of this-- but to see it so blatantly propagandized in a Disney film from my youth kinda makes me turn green.  So... love the film, wish it presented several sides of the times and not just the commie version.  That said, wondering whether to show it to my kids or not.  I can wade through it, but can they?",1503187200,,856,4.386075949367089
714991,5,6303675387,". . . and I was entranced. I wanted to see this movie but as a little boy I was too shy to admit that I wanted to see a movie that was about a girl.

Years passed as they do and the film slipped from my memory before resurfacing last week. I borrowed THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN (1985) along with a host of other movies that I had never gotten around to seeing, movies such as BAMBI (1942).

That was a tear drenched afternoon!

The DVD transfer is grainy and perfectly so. The film flickers like films did when they were projected back in those cozy days. The young protagonist is irresistibly innocent and rugged. John Cusack makes an unwelcome appearance that overcrowds our relationship with the young heroine then, as if aware of his intrusion, has the courtesy to disappear until later. There is an awesome animal sidekick and the everpresent threats of a hostile, untamed world around every corner. There is also at least one scene of mesmerizing cinematic greatness.

I was glad that I saved this one for an afternoon when I had planned to go through the boxes of my childhood possessions in the attic of my parents' house. Any attempt to hold back emotions was obliterated by this film, a film which I now consider to be one of my best friends.",1501632000,,1251,4.449781659388647

715018,4,6303675387,"Sure there's fighting in Newsies. There's dog fights and freaky corpse in White Fang. There's some crude humor in the new Beauty and The Beast. But this movie is a whole different level of dark for Disney while still keeping in the family film genre.

For starters this film is set in the Great Depression. The title character is a girl who acts more like a boy and doesn't have a problem with stealing, fighting, being disrespectful to adults, and basically doing whatever she has to in order to be herself and survive. And the stuff that happens to her is not nice (imprisonment, attempted sexual assault, and pretty much a constant threat of being hauled off somewhere horrible due to her status as a vagrant minor). Then again...

Meredith Salenger gives an incredible performance as Natty. She owns the role, and just becomes the character. You get caught up in her story, her quest to reunite with her father. Anyone who has affection for a family member can relate to her determination to reunite with the only family she has.  John Cusack's character makes the cover due to star power, but he's not in most of the film. He does, however, add some dramatic weight as Natty's friend and love interest (no, nothing wrong with that, this is Depression Era realism folks). I really appreciated the small sincere touches he adds to the film, and the relationship with Natty just adds another layer of complexity to the film.

As far as the Disney historic dramas go this is one of the most realistic. There's no glamorizing of the time period, and it's clearly a dark and scary world (not to mention a cold, wet, dismal one). The world-building is actually one of the best things about the film, as you get a real feel of how huge distances between cities felt, how hard jobs were to come by, and the danger of being on the side of unions/labor force at the time (early in the film Natty's father is called a Communist for his efforts).

Add to all that a side-plot of a wolf that keeps following Natty around, the dangerous work her father is doing to try to survive, and you have quite the compelling drama. I'm not a fan of the music or camera-work here, but as far as films that tell a story go, this is one of the best, if you can wrap your head around that unhappy world that makes up the setting and the tomboyish girl who is the main character (who does a lot of things you wouldn't want your kids to imitate).",1497916800,,2420,4.478458049886621

715282,5,6303675387,"This was an absolutely beautiful film, the sort that Disney will probably never make again. It's unfortunately easy to forget it ever existed because, for one reason or another, it's never broadcast on TV anymore. It's scarcely mentioned in any capacity. When I rediscovered this film, I was overcome with emotions that had been deeply embedded in me from seeing this back in preschool days. If one were to summarize what makes it different from most 21st century children's movies, it would be the sparse dialogue and powerful performances. It allows the audience to think, to be drawn into the time period rather than bombarded with fart jokes and loud-mouthed flat characters.

Why is this film so rarely known today? Is it because Natalie's father is a hard-working, humanized, sympathetic man who also happens to be a union leader?  Is it because she and John Cusack's character have a questionable age difference in their tacit (unconsummated) love?
In any case, it's a gritty story about innocence, with beautiful photography and an unforgettable soundtrack by James Horner.

715491,4,6303675387,"Natty Gann is a movie that had great potential. After all Disney has perfected the art of telling stories of of kids doing amazing things. Natty Gann came to theaters in 1985(a strange time in Disney movie making...look it up).  The movie came with great actors, a great story, setting, it should have been awesome, BUT for whatever reason it just missed the mark.

First, the story. It was good. There could have been better build up in some of the more intense situations.  There are characters that come and go quickly in the story that I wish I knew more about. I thought the movie had a great beginning, and just ok ending.

Second, the setting. Taking place in the depression, I really enjoyed the costuming, and set design of Chicago during the period. I also liked the outdoor setting. The Pacific Northwest was stunning.

Then,  there's the wolf. He's great, with an ol yeller quality about him. No one uses animals better in movies than Disney.

I need to mention the language, because no one else has. There is some profanity in this movie, which surprised me. So if you watch this with your little kids thinking oh this is Disney so no surprises. Well, you will be surprised",1453939200,,1186,4.592417061611374

Its the kind of movie that they don't make anymore.  Clean, unapologetically sentimental.  But leaves you entertained and with a good feeling.  I was a bit shocked at them showing young people smoking, I had forgotten about that. Although it is accurate to the period, it goes to show how much sensibilities have changed in the last 30 years.

I was disappointed with the transfer... looks like this was mastered in pre-anomorphic 4x3.  This really deserves an HD widescreen re-master.

THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN: Chicago, 1935: Sol Gann (Wise) gets himself a steady joba real coup in the Great Depression. Theres one catch, however: Its in Washington State, 2,000 miles away. Hes got to take itand when he gets some money hell send for his adolescent daughter Natty (Salenger). But shes impatient, independentand in trouble. She hops a westbound freight train, and in a whistle stop town rescues a wolf from a savage dog-fighting ring. Following a train wreck that leaves her lost and alone in the Colorado wilderness, the wolf repays the debt by protecting her against the elements. They form a fond bond of mutual protection that sees them through numerous misadventures and life-threatening events, as she searches for a father who believes shes deadbecause she refuses to believe he abandoned her.

Discussion: The English language and the march of time has retired a number of words descriptive of character traits, like pluck, grit and scrap. Natty Gann has all these traits, in spades. Her cross-country pilgrimage is as much a journey of maturity as geography, and she eventually graduates as a resourceful and triumphant roads scholar, finding treachery everywhere and love in the least likely places.

Were taught in college that anthropomorphism is a Bad Thing, but this film is not afraid of the big bad Wolf: an unusual traveling companion, surelybut one on a search ironically similar to Nattys. Their affectionate connection is not just a high point of this film, but the one that sets it apart from similar films. Another such element is the gorgeous photography, whether of excellent recreations of the threadbare Depression-era city, or of the exquisite forest landscapes of the American West. Never maudlin or manipulative, this period adventure of a girl and her wolf, living by their grit and wits, is a heartwarming charmer.",1423094400,,2115,4.952112676056338

The approach to storytelling and character is strong, the performances are understated.  It's not just a solid Disney movie, it's a solid movie, period.  One they should be proud of.

So, for the life of me, I can't understand why this film only exists in North America as a pan & scan copy.  It's a poor transfer, and the screen ratio HURTS the film, which is full of many wide shots.

Do like I did, use the 'contact us' link at Disneystudioshelp dot com page and send them an email telling them you want a widescreen release, a blu-ray, a full restoration!

The central character is a strong, independent girl who sets out to find her father and succeeds with the help of a dog-wolf companion and a young man who is wise in the ways of the hobo existance.  If you wonder that a young man could be so helpful, I can tell you that I knew young men of the same caliber when I was young and my family was in economic difficulties during a previous recession.

I was curious to know if it ""held up"" over the years and was still relevant, so I watched it again in its entirety. I was completely engaged by the story, found Meredeth Salenger to be a very convincing actress in her role of runaway teen girl in the depression searching for her father, and was again moved by her courage and determination.

Movies made for children these days are either cartoons or, I find, overly sappy. Some made-for-kids movies are actually quite violent and I believe inappropriate for young children. Natty Gann is none of these things, and tells a universal story of a gutsy girl on a dangerous journey to be reunited with her father.

Then as now, I often look for movies and books with real female heroines, which are more difficult to find in media then heroes.  Natty Gann is a young teen in the midst of the American great depression. She is separated from her father in Chicago when he goes west for work as a lumberman. Surviving on faith, courage, and the inner strength she learned from her father, Natty journeys by rail to find him.

The research for this film is excellent! All ages will appreciate the background history of the depression era. Meredith Salenger gives us a very tough and touching personal experience of the determination necessary to survive such hardship. She is accompanied by a wolf, who becomes her guardian, and meets up with another teen, played ""tough guy with tender heart"" by John Cusack. Thanks to Jeremy Kagen's direction, the acting and the story are very real. The portrayals (along the rail journey) of city life, rural life and shanty towns amid stunning natural wilderness is classic Disney. Inspiring adventure!

Meredith Salanger gives a star-making performance as a teenage girl growing up with her father during the depression. A young John Cusack has a nice turn as well, already showing the kind of quiet and surprising talent he would become known for in coming years.

Natty's father (Ray Wise) finds the only work he can during the depression and reluctantly leaves Natty with someone who turns out to have no love or compassion in her heart for anyone but herself. He has gone to Washington to cut trees and leaves a letter promising to send for her, along with a locket containing a picture of her dead mother. But when no word arrives she runs away to find him, riding the rails. Ray Wise gives a fine performance as a loving father forced by the depression to leave the daughter he adores in order to support them both and survive.

The great beauty of the Pacific Nortwest is the backdrop for a beautifully filmed and realistic journey of a time and place long gone. It is not the rose-colored journey one might expect from a Disney film, however. The people and places are real and she is met with both kindness and cruelty, including a brief scene when she hitches a ride with a pervert who tries to molest her.

She meets Cusak early on in this film and later when their paths cross again they tramp together, feelings for each other beginning to form. Meanwhile, due to a chain of events which causes her father to believe Natty dead, he is devastated and takes a very dangerous job. A wolf becomes Natty's friend and they travel together, looking out for one another. Though this may sound corny, it is handled in a realistic and believable way.

When Cusak finds work in California she must continue on to find her father. But there are sweet moments when she writes to him and we hope that somewhere down the line they will be together. There are some truly touching scenes which make this memorable, and an excellent film for parents to enjoy with young adults. Sort of forgotten today, this is a really special film I highly recommend.",1270166400,2,2145,4.578125
716515,5,6303675387,"I haven't seen the DVD version, but I have seen the VHS original many many times. I agree with everything that's been said about the cinematography, score, storyline, realism and acting. This is a minor Disney masterpiece. Episodic? Not in the least. The characters grow and change along the way as the result of their adventures. It will make you cry and laugh and wonder a bit at the lives of children in Depression, so many of whom were actually abandoned by their desperate parents, unlike Natty.

One thing no reviewer seems to have mentioned so far is the outstanding cameo performances by musicians Lainie Kazan and Scatman Crothers. Although each appear in the film only briefly their character acting is unexpectedly creative and convincing.

There is also Jed, the dog. As a result of Natty, I followed Jed's career through a few other movies, including White Fang. This intelligent wolf-dog makes Lassie look like a trained circus performer! He poignantly adds to the emotional feel of the movie. His love for Natty and equally strong love for freedom is palpable. His snarls in the boxcar scene are terrifying in the extreme.

There is not a single mediocre performance in this movie. Each actor adds something of substance to the film -- the child actors playing small parts no less so than Salenger and Cusack themselves.

This is one Disney movie that is not to be missed, either by young or old viewers.",1258243200,,1419,4.827160493827161

716572,5,6303675387,"Set in 1935, the Depression is the main villain in this emotional, coming-of-age adventure tale of a young girl's journey from Chicago to Washington in search of her father. When Natty Gann's father is offered a job as a logger in Washington, he must leave his tomboyish daughter with a friend until he can afford to send for her. Natty's habit of getting into trouble immediately lands her on the road, however, forced to become a rail-rider and having to avoid the law and adults in general, most of whom want to lock her up or worse. Along the way, she teams up with an intelligent and protective wolf that she helps escape from a dogfighting den and a more experienced young drifter seeking work wherever he can find it. Together, the three give each other the support they need to stay the course. Meanwhile, when Natty's father is informed of her wallet being found at the scene of a train wreck, he sinks into despair believing she has been killed and takes on the most dangerous jobs at the logging camp. If Natty doesn't find him in time, he's sure to be the next accidental death.

""The Journey of Natty Gann"" is a gem of a film coming from the Disney Studios at a time when their live-action features were thoughtful and low on glitter and plastic. Released in 1985, this was the era of Disney films like ""One Magic Christmas,"" ""Never Cry Wolf,"" and ""Flight of the Navigator."" Introducing 80's cutie Meredith Salenger in the title role and John Cusack as the fellow drifter she befriends, ""The Journey of Natty Gann"" does a marvelous job of recreating the world of the Great Depression and truly makes its presence felt throughout the film. The story is touching, beautifully shot, and frequently unpredictable, and the performances are wonderful. You may not like Natty much at the very beginning, but by the end you'll adore her.

The DVD release is another matter. Unfortunately, there's nothing really positive I can say about the release, and forget what I said about this film being beautifully shot when you sit down to watch it. It's got bad picture quality, horrible pan and scan, bad audio, zero extras... For something like that to happen to a movie like this is nothing short of a crime! All I can say is, this is a film everyone should have in their video library, but don't pay too much for this edition of it. It really is just like watching a VHS tape. Let's hope a better edition comes along someday, but I picked this one up just in case. Poor quality is better than not having this charming Disney classic at all.

Oh, and if you like this Disney film, please seek out other Disney live-action classics. Try the ones I mentioned in this review, and also checkout ""White Fang,"" ""Iron Will,"" and ""Napoleon and Samantha"" among others.",1188259200,2,2761,4.619144602851324

Set during the Depression, Meredith Salenger plays a tomboy who runs away from her caretaker in Chicago to find her father (played by Ray Wise) who's gone off to the Pacific Northwest to cut lumber - the only job he could find. Salenger, along with a wolf she befriends, has all kinds of adventures as she rides the rails west in boxcars, the most interesting being meeting up with John Cusack, who is also hoboing on the trains, and who gives her pointers and helps her out. It's sentimental but never corny, and the ending has just the right amount of suspense and good fortune the viewer expects. The photography is stunning. This Disney movie is a winner all around.",1162339200,4,855,4.594771241830065
716575,4,6303675387,"This movie is the tale of a young girl separated from her father by need, and how she tries to find him again.  The story will take young Natty Gann into the clutches of the worst of people and the best of people.

Natty Gann (Meredith Salenger, in her first movie role) lives with her father in Chicago.  Unfortunately, her father does not have steady employment.  Natty tends to run with a group of kids, and is on the verge of getting into trouble.  One day Natty's father Sol (nicely played by Ray Wise) gets an opportunity for employment in Washington.  Sol tries to find Natty before he leaves, but she is out with her friends.  Sol asks Connie (Lainie Kazan) to watch out for Natty until he can send money for a ticket to Washington.  Connie soon decides that Natty is too much trouble, and she calls the authorities.  Before the authorities can show up, Natty is off to find her father.

The rest of the movie is devoted primarily to Natty's travels.  She soon encounters Harry, played by John Cusack.  I am usually lukewarm about John Cusack, but I liked him in this movie.  Cusack convinced me that he was worldly in spite of being very young.  He managed to care without seeming to, which is a difficult trick for any actor.  Natty encounters Harry a couple of times on her journey, and the pair begins a budding romance.

Natty also encounters a dog that looks a lot like a wolf.  Natty calls him Wolf.  Jed, the dog that played Wolf, also played the title role in the movie ""White Fang.""  Wolf is Natty's companion almost to the end of the movie.  Wolf manages to get Natty out of trouble several times, and Natty does her best to return the favor.

Natty and Wolf make their way from Chicago to Washington, though Natty is not sure where her father is.  Along the way, Natty is placed in a girls' home, a pervert molests her, she rides the rails, gets burned out of a shanty town, resorts to eating garbage, and much more.  Natty's journey is a realistic trip through the depression-era United States.  Of course the journey is scary, but this movie is a Disney movie so the movie is held to a PG level.

I missed this movie when it was in the theaters in 1985.  It seems like I was one of many who missed the movie, because it did poorly.  However, this movie has done well on video and DVD because it is a good family movie.  While Natty seems plagued by poor judgment and the ability to encounter shady characters, her goal of reuniting with her father is a perfect central theme for a Disney movie.  It helps that Meredith Salenger, who was about 15-years-old when she portrayed 12-year-old Natty, had the face and character to fill the role of Natty.

Though this movie has a PG rating, I think it is suitable family fare for all but the littlest of children, who would likely be bored by the movie, unless beautiful Wolf excites them.  I have seen this movie several times, and consider it one of my favorites when I am looking for an interesting, uplifting story.  I hope you will find it to be a movie that you like too.

John Cusack was appalling (thank god he got better because I actually think he's a great actor...now...but here he was terrible)  The young girl that played Natty (Salenger) was by far the best performer in the bunch, and her father (Wise) was just rediculous.  He always had this face on him that was a mix of nausea and constipation...he just looked rediculouis.  The film could have been so much better because it had so much promise in the story line but the poor acting mixed with bad quality (the picture is grainy and the sound is poor) made for a forgettable experience.  ALSO, I agree with some that this isn't the best choice for family film.  I agree with the age difference between Natty and Harry being kinda creepy..I mean, she's 12 and he was at least 17-18...And the fact that Natty utters cuss words throughout the film is another dissapointment.  The film is a PG Walt Disney film...that should stand for something.  Anyways...like I said...it's not the worst film I've seen, and judging by all the favorable reviews I must be the only person who feels this way but...It's far from a great film and it's not one I'll ever see again.",1144627200,5,1324,4.672413793103448
716578,5,6303675387,"In the mid-1980s, the Walt Disney Company wanted to break out into a market in which they could target more than just the family audience and have some mature themes. Thus, Touchstone Pictures was born- their first film being Splash!

THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN was produced under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, but it quite easily could have been produced by Touchstone Pictures since it goes slightly beyond the regular Disney family fare. Set during the Depression, it tells the story of a teenage girl called Natty Gann (played by Meredith Salenger who would go on to guest star in the second season of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and the fifth season of ""Dawson's Creek""), who travels across America to be reunited with her father, who due to necessary circumstances has had to take a job on the other side of the country. Along the way, Natty is befriended by a Wolf and a fellow traveller (John Cusack of ""Serendipity"".)

This movie is what it is. It's not particularly action-oriented, or overly-romantic (a fake kiss between John Cusack and a much younger Meredith Salenger - probably due to various child laws - is towards the end of the picture). The cinematography is excellent and looks natural and beautiful, and the film travels at a nice pace. Being that this movie is what it is, it does a beautiful job at being just that.

The DVD has no special features at all, and the film is only broadcast in Dolby (2.0) Surround, but there probably wasn't much extra material made at the time. This film is quite possibly the best of Disney's live action movies and it has a special place in my heart. Maybe it'll find a special place in your heart too.",1122940800,7,1661,4.642857142857143

The story takes place in the midst of the Great Depression and starts out in Chicago. Natty and her father are struggling to make ends meet, but still manage to love each other and survive. Trouble comes when Natty's father finally gets a job - in Washington. Unable to find Natty to tell her, he leaves her a note and leaves her in the charge of an overbearing boardinghouse owner. Fed up with bad treatment and not wanting to believe that her father abandoned her, Natty sets out to meet up with her father, hopping on trains and hitching rides west. Along the way, she helps free a wolf who is being used in dog fights. She and the wolf meet up later and become companions. Natty also joins up with John Cusack, another drifter looking for work.
The movie includes beautiful scenery and an interesting portrayal of Depression-era America. The relationships are also fascinating. For instance, Natty only calls the wolf ""wolf,"" and still recognizes that he is a wild animal. In other words, she doesn't attempt to make him into a pet. Additionally, her relationship with John Cusack's character is not silly, self-conscious, or filled with expectation.
Another reviewer noted that the DVD version of this movie is disappointing. I found the quality of my DVD to be absolutely fine. There are no special features, but the film itself is of decent quality.

TjoNG is one of the reasons I fell in love with wolves & learned to overcome my American cultural ignorance of them.

During her trip, we have a first hand look at the desparation many people suffered through during the depression.  The scenery is gorgeous, and the score is terrific.  This should be a Disney classic and it's too bad the people at Disney don't realize it, which brings me to the bad part of this review.
Apperently there isn't anyone at Disney who ever thought this movie would be or could be this great.  It was released on VHS, but was out of print and unavailable for a long time, unless of course you wanted to spend mega-bucks for it on Ebay.  I would have hoped that with this re-release, it would have gained some measure of respect, but Disney only saw fit to slap a quick pan and scan version on DVD and sell it at a low price to make a few bucks.  The transfer is horrible, the picture is grainy much of the time, the characters out of frame, and most of the scenery is completely lost.  The audio is ordinary, much of the sounds when they are in the forest inaudible,  and the beautiful score is completely wasted.  It's too bad that the people at Disney don't know what a gem they have.  In other words, the movie gets five stars, the DVD transfer gets one star....which averages out to a three.

Scribbled on them were words such as ""Never Ending Story"", ""The Secret of Nimh"", ""Muppets take Manhatten"", ""Old Yeller"", ""The Princess Bride"", ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Star Wars"", ""Karate Kid"", and ""Pinnocchio"". Now, on the same tape, written beneath pinnocchio, and that soap we accidentally recorded once, was this movie, Nattie Gann.
When I pulled it from the others, I knew that I was going to cry. I was a soft hearted little bugger back then. (That one Benji with the couger cubs nearly put me in the hospital). Even as a kid I knew what a good movie was. Those were the days when Marty was racing through time, trying to hook up his parents; when your best pals were a couple of Goonies.

Nattie is a tough bird, fighting any boy that crosses her, and puffing cigs in the guy's bathroom. Her dad gets a job when work was hard to come by. The only catch is that it's far away. When he leaves her with the sinister ""Connie"", Nattie ventures out into the world of the great depression. On her way she befriends the wolf, endures a train crash, and falls for a young John Cusack.

Set in the Depression, Natty Gann runs away from the woman her father had left her with when he got a job in the Pacific Northwest.  Her journey is truly exciting as she dodges Child Welfare, befriends a wolf and meets up with John Cusack.  In the meantime, her father has to search for her when he finds she's missing.  Definitely an overlooked gem of a film.  I will definitely buy this when Disney chooses to release the entire movie.",1023235200,28,622,4.201680672268908
716675,3,6303675387,"This is one of those rare movies where the story, cinematography and musical score come together in magnificient form to transplant the viewer into another time and space. Why the musical score had such an impact on me, that I found myself cassette taping (Yep, used cassettes back in the 80's) parts of the movie from a VHS tape so that I could enjoy it later. There was so much emotion in those notes. It wasn't until recently that I learned that credit goes to James Horner... I guess I shouldn't be surprised. His work is just as moving in films such as ""Field of Dreams"" or ""Titanic""
So, when I saw that the DVD would be released I carefully clicked the ""technical specs"" only to learn my worst fear... Pan and Scan. Such a visual treat as this movie shouldn't be seen this way, and I really hope that Disney decides to give us a widescreen version. Why even my 10 year old wants widescreen versions of movies (and is also a little miffed over ""Snow Dogs"" P/S only version)
Disney can do awesome DVDs... They did it with the widescreen Swiss Family Robinson. Now, let's see them do it for ""Natty Gann "".  Let us all view the movie as we did in the theatres back in '85.",1023148800,14,1174,4.336363636363636
716676,1,6303675387,"Disney Studios has done it again! They finally release a gem of a wonderful 5 star movie on DVD but selfishly release it in the fullscreen format of the 1.33:1 aspect ratio instead of the original 2.35:1 widescreen format. Missing is beautiful verdant cinematography of the Pacific northwest.

Newer home theater systems and DVD players are meant to exploit new technology and not sent it back to the days of top load VHS players. Disney's arrogant approach shows they have no respect for the consumer and the buying public should not tolerate this attitude! - - A note to Roy Disney: I'm so sorry for the shoddy treatment given to this film; I believe your Uncle Walt would want this movie to be viewed the way it was filmed.

**And why is this wonderful DVD available in its OAR of 2.35:1 in Region 2 Europe?  Are we here in Region 1 North America not worthy of seeing our own films the way they were meant to be seen?",1022976000,4,920,4.464285714285714
716677,5,6303675387,"I don't know what to say about ""The Journey of Natty Gann"" that hasn't already been said. This is a riveting film that never ceases to entertain. The outstanding and auspicious debut of Meredith Salenger belies her later career, most recently seen in the campy horror flick ""Lake Placid"" in a small role. This is also one of John Cusack's first roles, and he's perfect, as is Ray Wise as Natty's father. The Oscar nominated costumes are period-perfect, as are the sets, convincingly portraying Depression era America. A Widescreen version is sorely missing from the recently released DVD; a lot of period detail was lost. Let's hope someone comes along to correct this gross over-sight. The magnificent vistas of the Pacific northwest, captured by photographer Dick Bush, would also be enhanced by a Widescreen format. The music of James Horner is symphonic at times (reminiscent of the best of Aaron Copland), as it also incoporates folk music and grand,sweeping passages to compliment the adventure that is taking place. The director, Jeremy Kagan, brilliantly kept a flow and consistant feeling of excitement (he won the Golden Prize at the Moscow Film Festival). Episodic as some might think, each episode is woven into the next with care and a fine feel for the narrative at large...a fine example of great editing. This is, quite simply, and all-around excellent film. Tears are bound to flow, but they won't be manipulated; there's genuine pathos in the final development of events, and not sappy, either. As I said, except for the Pan & Scan treatment, the DVD is well presented, though there are no extras. It's OK, though, because the price is more than reasonable. SEE THIS FILM! And show it to the whole family.",1022716800,34,1723,4.944827586206896
716678,5,6303675387,"Well, this film came and went in the 1980s without much hoopla.  But I was one of the few who saw it, and I must say, it was one of my favorite films back then and remains to this day one of my favorite films.  Like ""Never Cry Wolf,"" it represents one of the few films made by Disney in the 1980s which is family-oriented yet doesn't insult the intelligence.  Meredith Salenger, as Natty, plays the daughter of a Depression-era dad who must go cross country for work; consequently, the film is about her journey to find him and re-unite the family.  There is nothing stupid or silly about the film, as is often the case with Disney family films.  The film doesn't shy away either from showing the grimy, dirty conditions in which these people must etch out a living, and the characters are not cookie-cutter good/bad but are realistic in their feelings and actions.  Not to mention, the imagery is the film, from the inner city dirt to the mid-west open fields, is quite lovely and haunting at times.  Almost reminds me of ""Days of Heaven,"" another masterpiece (from the 1970s).
Anyways, the film is FINALLY coming out on DVD, which I'm been waiting forever for.  I'm quite eager to add this film to my collection, as I do not think there are many live-action Disney films which are its equal.  I cannot even begin to recommend this film enough, it belongs in everyone's DVD collection!  A strong 5 stars all the way; I just hope Disney does the film justice on the transfer. :)",1016064000,4,1478,4.50187265917603
716679,5,6303675387,"During the Summer of 1985 my adopted daughter, Keri, approached me in my den and said, ""Dad, I'm taking you to a movie tomorrow so don't plan anything, okay?""
""Do I need to get some cash,"" I  asked?
""Nope.  It's my treat.  Anyway, if I take you, you don't have  to pay.""  Noticing my questioning look she added, ""Daddys go free  with their daughters.""
""Will I like the movie,"" I  asked?
""You'd better!""
""Like"" was an  understatement. I loved the movie.  Perhaps because I could relate it to  Keri who, at 12 was still looking for her real father. In any case, the  Journey of Natty Gann was one of the best daddy-daughter memories in my  life.
My daughter's grown up and now I have granddaughters, who, I  thought, might like to see the motion picture their mommy took me to see  when she was a little girl.  But, alas, it is nowhere to be found.  I  bought a copy when Disney released it some years later but I loaned it to  my twins who loaned it to a friend who loaned it to ?  So it's lost and  now not even Amazon has a copy.
So, if you ever get an opportunity to see  Natty Gann on a TV movie channel, clear your slate and watch this  magnificient film of daddy-daughter love and conquest over adversity.",964569600,11,1210,4.237885462555066

7853664,4,6303675387,"This story starts with the caption - Chicago - 1935. This is the misery of the depression - hunger, desperation, anger, frustration presented within the first minutes.

Natty and dad alone in a ratty, rundown apartment. Father leading labor agitator. Proclaims in angry meeting - You have a right to a job!

Nattys friends accuse - Hes a commie and will travel to Russia! (He denies it). Natty defends her dad with her fists.

This social, political, economic, cultural chaos provides the foundation, the backdrop for the drama. Only jobs provided are by government (photograph of Roosevelt on wall). Implies that the business world never has, and never will employ anyone.

This heartbreaking situation leads to her father leaving her in Chicago with an acquaintance. Disaster. Now we begin the drama. Natty rides the rails traveling to Washington State.

Befriending a wolf, surviving train wreck, running from abusive orphanage, starving in forest, etc., etc., all are here. Only two positive encounters, a young hobo, and a horribly disfigured blacksmith.

Every other person is either selfish, corrupt, abusive, mean, cruel or arrogant.

She does find her dad, and film ends with the message that sheer desire, heartfelt feelings will always triumph. They conquered the horrible people!

This film presents (to me) more as a social, political (philosophical) commentary, than a survival drama. The depression is much more of a character than any of the actors. The assumption driving this story is that American society is awful.

The plot just doesnt hold water. The explanations of each crises and Nattys solutions just aren't believable.

For example, a viscous fighting wolf changes into a loyal, kind, protector after one biscuit? No, I don't think so. The wolf kills a rabbit and brings it to her! What! So on. . .on. . .

Maybe the philosophical basis here is the idea, the conviction that human motives, human will, human emotion are the key to reality.

You have a right to a job! (Only selfish people prevent employment).

A eighty pound teenage girl can overcome obstacles that her intelligent, capable father cannot! Where does that come from?

Strikes me that the message becomes - if we, society, employers, officials, parents, children or anyone else - want (feel) something deeply enough - it will always happen!

Ergo, if we have any unresolved suffering, it is because we (or someone) doesnt care!

Not a bad movie.

The analytical old man (me) was not impressed.

The romantic old woman (wife) enjoyed it.",1516579200,,2529,5.067632850241546
