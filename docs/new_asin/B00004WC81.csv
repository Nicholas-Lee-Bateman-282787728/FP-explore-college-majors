7924982,5,B00004WC81,"Such sophisticated, well-done tasteful comedy such as this delightful series is rare.  I couldn't wait to add this collection.
Here in the 225 minutes on three videos are my three favorites: Burial at Sea, Beddings and Weddings and Fire and Brimstone.
Lowe as the irreplaceable Duddleswell and Abineri as curate Boyd and Daye as Mrs. Pring as such a treat.  They are such well done characters that one wants to be around them.
I get equally into it with each re-viewing.  Anyone who appreciates really good comedy will be treated to what is a special series, documenting good natured life at its best at St. Judes, 1951.",1016582400,3,620,4.775700934579439
