The show is supposed to be streamed in 4K but there are only a few (and I mean a just a few) instances where that proposition seems actually to be a true statement. The picture on NetFlix's Murdoch Mysteries is much more like 4K and is only streamed in 1080p!

This is a perfect video to enjoy while exercising, as I do on my stationary bike machine. The episodes cover a wide variety of aviation topics. The video is produced in Canada with a focus on Canadian aviation, but aviation is aviation everywhere, so U.S. viewers would enjoy it as well. I particularly have enjoyed segments filmed in flight simulators and those dealing with air traffic control. The Canadian air traffic control system is very similar to that existing in the U.S., thus U.S. viewers would gain insight into how our system works, as well. As inferred from the title, most of the information presented is done directlly through interviews and demonstrations with participant 'aviators'.

4436339,1,B004NMFWNQ,"After reading the summary of an episode I expected the entire 30 minutes would be dedicated to that topic. Turns out, in the first episode at least, 3-4 topics were covered, and none in too much detail.
Perhaps subsequent episodes are better but I had no interest in checking them out.",1396656000,,285,4.607843137254902
4436340,5,B004NMFWNQ,Delightful variety of subjects. Each segment is just long enough too cover the subject and then you go on to another subject. Each subject is different from the preceding one so the level of interest is high.,1395964800,,208,4.648648648648648

4436350,5,B004NMFWNQ,"This television show is excellent! It's like Top Gear (the UK version) for all things aviation, perhaps without the humor. The bite-sized features are accessible and really yield a lot of information on products and information sources that you can access on your own time. It may not be of interest to those without a lot of interest in aviation, but you certainly don't have to be a pilot to fall in love the show.",1388361600,,416,4.56
4436351,3,B004NMFWNQ,"Usually interesting but hardly ""heart stopping"". The episode I just watch rates 2 stars; the last half was nothing more than a commercial for AOPA (a worthwhile organization, but still). Glad this program is free with Amazon Prime.",1386720000,,231,5.105263157894737

4436353,5,B004NMFWNQ,"Fairly short episodes but surprisingly entertaining. The topics are interesting, the interviewers ask good questions. Great show - one of the best aviation-related shows around. The synopsis of each episode leads you to believe it's a show on a single topic but it's really several topics in each show. Very well done series.",1385078400,,325,5.150943396226415

4436362,4,B004NMFWNQ,I have enjoyed airplanes since I was very young. My dad would take me to the international airport in our city in Colombia and we would watch planes together and he would tell me all about the airplanes.

Take some time and check this out!,1380672000,,371,4.314285714285714
4436363,5,B004NMFWNQ,"The series is written for those interested in aviation, and explains more about general aviation than the general public usually has available.  Those involved in aviation first hand might want to delve a little deeper, but the stories are paced quickly, usually touching 3 topics or story-lines per episode.  If you are used to the typical reality slog of 40 minutes of hype and 3 minutes of content, you will not find that here.  If you walk away from this show in progress, then you miss actual content.

They just kept talking about how much fun they were having and how awesome it was, but as a viewer I didn't feel like I had been there or even learned much.

The series gets a lot better with later seasons, although still suffers from the feeling that its being made by whom -- local TV station film-school wannabes?",1369440000,,261,4.574468085106383
4436396,5,B004NMFWNQ,"i truly enjoy this series.  it has a lot of interesting facts and in general is quite well made,  love it",1369440000,,105,3.9523809523809526
4436397,4,B004NMFWNQ,If you love airplanes this is an informative show. It shows many different aspects of flying from acrobat to airlines.,1369180800,,118,4.95

4436399,4,B004NMFWNQ,Great introduction to anyone interested in General Aviation. I liked the episode that included LSA and the one flying the Goodyear Blimp.,1368576000,,137,5.2727272727272725
4436400,5,B004NMFWNQ,"For most of us flying is fighting our way through large busy airports on to overcrowded and cramped airliners.  The Aviators takes one to the small general aviation air[orts and focuses on people who fly be cause it is fun and exciting.  You will see wonderful flying machines that you will see nowhere else.  Forget about putting your tray table and seat in an upright position, just settle in and have a good time.",1368489600,3,416,4.594594594594595
4436401,5,B004NMFWNQ,WOW what can I say. This show is fantastic. Can't wait to see season 2. A must see of aviators and even non-aviators are interested in flight like I am.,1368230400,,152,4.1
4436402,5,B004NMFWNQ,"From someone who is not yet, but hoping to certified as a private pilot, these episodes are exciting and encouraging",1368230400,,116,4.85
4436403,4,B004NMFWNQ,"On my iPad, I can watch movies through my TV, but NOT if I use an HDMI cable. What's up with that?

I travel a lot, and I routinely watch my Netflix movies by streaming them off my iPad. But I can't do the same with the Amazon Instant Video app.

If you don't want to lose more and more business, PLEASE fix the app.",1367798400,,316,3.8461538461538463
4436404,5,B004NMFWNQ,A well documented series well written and gives an exclusive look at aviation up close. A must for a beginning or seasoned pilot.,1367625600,,129,4.6521739130434785
4436405,5,B004NMFWNQ,"If you are a pilot or just a fan of aviation, then you will love this series. The only complaint is that the episodes are only 25 min or so.",1367107200,,140,3.7
4436406,5,B004NMFWNQ,I liked this show because I am going to go to Oshkosh this year and this episode covers a lot of the show up there.,1366329600,,115,3.64
4436407,5,B004NMFWNQ,"I'm a pilot but do not get to fly as much as I'd like.  This show scratches that itch (or makes it worse - I haven't figured it out yet).  While it is geared towards pilots, I think non-pilots would enjoy it too.  The camerawork is done very well and being in HD it feels like you are right there in the cockpit.

One slight critisism is that once in a while there is a segment on a particular product that feels a little like a 5-minute infomercial but I'm not really bothered by it to be honest.  I hope this show never goes away!",1366070400,,532,4.0285714285714285
4436408,5,B004NMFWNQ,"As a pilot I've learned a lot from this series, and gone places I've never been before....but now, may go.  These folks know their stuff and obviously are determined to share as much as possible with their public.  They've chosen great things to cover and each episode has enough different topics that there will be something you'll enjoy.",1365811200,2,339,4.827586206896552
4436409,4,B004NMFWNQ,"Put wings on it and I am a fan. This was a good introduction to the series and anchored with a rather lightweight story about the biggest airshow in the world, EAA's Airventure in Oshkosh, WI.",1365120000,,192,4.361111111111111
4436410,5,B004NMFWNQ,"If you love flight and wish you were a pilot, you should take the plunge! But, while you are slogging through the training this show can help keep you motivated. Learning to fly is easy, doing it right and safely is hard. This is a real look into aviation from real pilots so there is very little ""fluff"".",1364601600,2,305,4.275862068965517
4436411,3,B004NMFWNQ,Not enough flying.  Those who like flying look at Flying Wild Alaska and then 16 Right.  Someone missed a great opportunity to document a lot of flying.,1364083200,,152,4.592592592592593
4436412,5,B004NMFWNQ,"What a great overview of the aviation world - from ultralights all the way up to the big iron! We need more programs like this to instill the excitement of aviation into the non-flying public! This is a great series because they have topics that are of interest to all levels of the flying (and non-flying) community.

My only negative about the series would be the repetition of the same video clips throughout the different segments. Hopefully, in Seasons 2 & 3 they'll get more video so they won't have to duplicate as much :-)",1363824000,7,530,4.578947368421052
4436413,5,B004NMFWNQ,"A random find that I've really come to enjoy.  This series is out of Canda and provides a vast array of aircraft, people, history and excellent video.  If you like flying, planes or anything to do with aircraft, you'll enjoy this series.",1363737600,,237,4.619047619047619
4436414,5,B004NMFWNQ,"The series is fantastic. But what was that huge fireball in the background? I'm talking about Season 1, episode 1, at about 1:45 into the show. There's a scene of a parachutist, then they cut back to the interview with 2 people on camera. Right in between them, far behind, we see a huge fireball followed by thick black smoke. If you listen carefully you can hear the explosion. But the talking heads on camera did not react to this, and the show makes no mention of it.",1363305600,,471,4.363636363636363
4436415,3,B004NMFWNQ,"I really enjoyed this series, except for duration of each episode.  Each series should last at least 55 minutes.

Some scenes are repeated in different episodes

8436757,3,B004NMFWNQ,"If you like aerobatics and war planes, this is the the show for you.  Personally, I feel those topics have already been beaten to death in every video series made.  Also, they try to stuff three different topics in a 24 minute episode with opening and closing credits, music and talking in between.  There's no main course here, just appetizers.
