8225629,5,B000WTZ6G2,"Love this tape.  The aerobic section takes me back to the 90s.  Hits the entire body.  I like to do the entire tape, so it's a bit lengthy.  Allow 1.5 hours for the workout minus the face and nutrition section.",1393459200,,210,4.175
8225630,5,B000WTZ6G2,"Video is divided into various areas of concentration: cardio, legs, arms, etc
Admittedly, I am out of shape:  I can do all the exercises with some modification so as I improve, I can still use the DVD and still  get a good workout.  Most of the selections are 20 minutes, (some are shorter) so I can get in a workout without needing a huge chunk of time.  I borrowed this and other DVDs from my public library to see which I wanted to purchase and this one made the cut.",1374624000,,470,4.188888888888889

Seems like a scenery at a Spa.  Delightful!",1276646400,,85,4.0
8225632,5,B000WTZ6G2,"This has a little of everything.  Yoga, aerobics, stretching.  The main thing I like, and I only recently started doing, is the face and neck stretching at the end of the DVD, it has really helped with the tension headaches.  The instructor, Lucy, has a very soothing, Australian accent, its very  relaxing .  The scenery is breathtaking.  The only down side is the price.  It's a bit pricy for what you get, but I'm glad I purchased it.",1229817600,3,437,4.5256410256410255
