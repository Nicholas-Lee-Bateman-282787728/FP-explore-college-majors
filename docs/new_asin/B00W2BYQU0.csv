7118505,3,B00W2BYQU0,"High points:  Blackberry Smoke ""Workin' for MCA"";  Jason Isbell ""I Know a Little""
Low points:  Cheap Trick ""Gimme Back My Bullets""  (EPIC fail...one of my favorite bands, but why were they even on the program?)
  Peter Frampton's attempt at a guitar solo ""Call Me the Breeze""
  Charlie Daniels attempt at a guitar solo ""Down South Jukin""
  Alabama's lead player's attempt at a guitar solo ""Gimme Three Steps""

Props to the ""house band"" especially Michael Bearden on keyboards and Sonny Emory on drums who were excellent.  I expected a little more fire from guitarist Audley Freed given the reputation he's developed since his days with Cry of Love, but he was merely OK.",1440633600,3,670,4.883928571428571

7118510,4,B00W2BYQU0,"I enjoyed this ""blast from the past"". I am 58 yrs old and went to many, many concerts in my time.  Lynyrd skynrd was and is still one of my favorites. My complaint is, with all the music legends that were there for the tribute, why did most of them change the lyrics? No one sang their tribute without changing the words. That was a disappointment. I still enjoyed it and will always, just let down.",1443830400,,399,4.25

8711885,5,B00W2BYQU0,"I love this DVD!  I went to the show and immediately bought this when it was available!  LS deserved to be honored and this concert did them justice, Charlie Daniels, Gregg Allman, Jason Isbell, Blackberry Smoke, Donny Van Zant, Peter Frampton, John Hiatt, Jamey Johnson - just to name a few.  Tuesday's Gone , Four Walls of Raiford, Working for the MCA are three of my favorites.  I would recommend anyone to get this DVD.  It is great entertainment to honor the best band there is.",1446422400,,483,4.569767441860465
