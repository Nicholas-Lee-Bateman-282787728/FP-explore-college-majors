THE LAST EMPEROR is a 1987 biopic about the life of Puyi, the last Emperor of the China dynasty (1644  1912), whose autobiography was the basis for the screenplay written by Mark Peploe and Bernardo Bertolucci. Independently produced by Jeremy Thomas, it was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1987 by Columbia Pictures. Puyi's life is depicted from his ascent to the throne as a small boy to his imprisonment and political rehabilitation by the Chinese Communists.

FILM FACT No. 2: Bernardo Bertolucci proposed the film to the Chinese government as one of two possible projects; the other was an adaptation of La Condition Humaine (Man's Fate) by Andr Malraux. The Chinese preferred THE LAST EMPEROR film. Producer Jeremy Thomas managed to raise the $25 million budget for his ambitious independent production single-handedly and at one stage, he scoured the phone book for potential financiers. Bernardo Bertolucci was given complete freedom by the authorities to shoot in The Forbidden City, which had never before been opened up for use in a Western film. For the first ninety minutes of the film, Bernardo Bertolucci and Vittorio Storaro made full use of its visual splendour. 19,000 extras were needed over the course of the film. The Chinese army was drafted in to accommodate.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE LAST EMPEROR [LULTIOM IMPERATORE] [1987] is a film that is totally unique and quite unsurpassed visual splendour, and makes for a fascinating trip to another world, but for the most part also proves as remote and untouchable as its subject, the last imperial ruler of China. The prodigious production values stand out in every respect, and Bernardo Bertoluccis film is an exquisitely painted mural of 20th century Chinese history as seen from the point of view of a hereditary leader who never knew his people and when viewed in the cinema, audiences were seduced by its exotic qualities, and spectacular image qualities.

Bernardo Bertolucci's visually ravishing spectacle THE LAST EMPEROR [1987] is about the life of Pu Yi (1905  1967) and is a genuine rarity, meaning it is a blockbuster that manages to be not only historically instructive, but also intensely personal at the same time. Pu Yi, who of course is played by three children at ages 3, 8, and 15, and by John Lone as an adult and remained an outsider to contemporary Chinese history for most of his life, and Bernardo Bertolucci uses his remoteness from China as an objective correlative of our own cultural distance as Westerners and virtually all of the dialogue is spoken in English. Working with visual and thematic rhymes, Bernardo Bertolucci is interested in charting the gradual substitution of the state for the family, though two key agents in this process are the father figures of his Scottish tutor Reginald Johnson [Peter O'Toole] and a governor at a Chinese prison.

The life story recounted here is an utterly singular one without possible equal. In 1908, the 3-year-old Pu Yi is installed as Lord of Ten Thousand Years, master of the most populous nation on earth. Shortly, he is forced to abdicate, but is kept on as a symbolic figure, educated by his English tutor and tended to by a court that includes 1,500 eunuchs and countless other manipulative advisers.

Technically considered a god by everyone, and of course little Pu Yi can do anything he wishes except leave the great Forbidden City in Peking. Except for hearsay and what he learns in magazines, and is ignorant of the convulsions being experienced by his people in China; and of course he is a prisoner in the most glorious gilded cage ever created.

Eventually is expelled out by the new government, Pu Yi, by now in his late 20s, moves with his two wives to Tientsin and lives like a Western playboy, wearing tuxedos at elegant dances while gradually coming under the influence of the Japanese, who eventually install him as puppet emperor of Manchuria, home of his ancestors. After World War II, he is imprisoned for 10 years by the communists, during which time he writes his memoirs, and ends his life as a gardener and simple citizen in Maos China.

The shooting of THE LAST EMPEROR was an epic event in itself and perhaps the ultimate international coproduction, it was characterized as ""a film about China produced by an Englishman and directed by an Italian in English with many American actors."" The $25,000,000 production, by far the most extensive usage of Chinese locations by Western filmmakers up to that time, required 16 weeks of shooting at places such as the Liaodong peninsula, Manchuria, Beijing and, of course, The Forbidden City. Some 19,000 extras, which many of them were loaned from the Chinese army and 9,000 costumes, were used for the film, figures unthinkable in a Western production with a similar budget. Interiors and the re-education camp scenes were shot at sound stages at Cinecitta in Italy. Finally, acknowledgement must be made of the enormously impressive job pulled off by Jeremy Thomas in organizing such an ambitious production. It was a great adventure to revisit this visually stunning film, with its superb production design from Ferdinando Scarfiotti and costumes by James Acheson. I feel the films richness has been highlighted in a totally magical way. But above all, the 3D process has reaffirmed Bernardo Bertoluccis epic vision and especially Vittorio Storaro award winning cinematography. This 3D conversion could hopefully reach new audiences and find new markets for a cinema classic. Its important for us to keep films alive, so I am hoping that this won't be an isolated experiment. Like the recent The Wizard of Oz 3D conversion, Bernardo Bertoluccis THE LAST EMPEROR 3D is well worth checking out.

Blu-ray 3D Image Quality  THE LAST EMPEROR has had full restoration of the 25-year old film was done at Technicolor in Rome, Italy, which was scanned from the original negative to 4K, and colour corrected under cinematographer Storaro's supervision. The conversion was led by Prime Focus in London, where Matthew Bristowe is Senior VP, Production, View-D and Richard Baker is Creative Director/Senior Stereographer. But as to the visual aspect of the film, here you are presented with an absolutely stunning 3D dimensional 1080p image presentation and is enhanced with an outstanding 2.20:1 [Technovision] (Anamorphic) aspect ratio, which is again helped by the 4K restoration. The awesome colours are rich and natural looking, especially with all the orange red, green, and blue are all totally spectacular with its high definition transfer certainly is very effective overall. What are also very effective are the blacks that look very convincing in every scene, and the delicate grain structure of the film is also excellently presented. But overall I was most definitely pleased with the look of the whole film and the 3D image presentation really enhances the overall look of the film and of course looks even more spectacular than the 2D image presentation, but the 3D image presentation provides more depth to the image and is never intrusive and really adds great depth and really comes to play in the Forbidden City. But of course the whole package on the image presentation is given a boost by the professional approach of the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, A.S.C., A.I.C. (Director of Photography). But overall is the 3D is a brilliant addition to the Blu-ray disc. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  With the film THE LAST EMPEROR it has of course two languages in Italian and English 5.1 DTS-HD High Resolution Surround Sound really stands out with an enhanced audio presentation, especially with the scene where you hear the large horns in the Forbidden City when the Emperor captures the cricket. As to the dialogue presentation and the musical score by composers Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Byrne and Cong Su are faithfully reproduced integrating well with the visuals, and comes through crystal clear and gives a superb beautiful ambience towards this beautiful classic film and especially gives sufficient dynamics to offer an engaging experience and good separation of sound effects and the films music score is nicely balanced into the good audio mix.
, this was also very crisp, clear and very easy to follow and much appreciated and the sound engineers deserved their awards and nominations for the professional job they really achieved.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Sadly there are no Extras or even a Theatrical Trailer, because you only get one Blu-ray disc, why couldn't they have given us a 2D Blu-ray with the film and then they could of added special features, still despite this, the film looks totally spectacular in 3D and really makes the film even more impressive.

BONUS: The slip cover has a stunning 3D image that is quite spectacular and well worth the purchase.

Finally, THE LAST EMPEROR film is a unique, and quite unsurpassed visual splendour, and for a fascinating trip to another world, but for the most part also proves as remote and untouchable as its subject, the last imperial ruler of China. A prodigious production in every respect, Bernardo Bertoluccis first film in six years since his last film and is an exquisitely painted mural of 20th century Chinese history as seen from the point of view of a hereditary leader who never knew his people. Shown in its world premiere as the closing night attraction at the Tokyo International Film Festival, and the film should deservedly receive serious attention any chance you can to view it. Performance in debut engagements should be strong, but can the key component to recoupment of its $25 million cost, will of course domestic audiences are seduced by its exotic qualities, or put off by its cold virtuosity, and here is your chance to find out. Highly Recommended!
