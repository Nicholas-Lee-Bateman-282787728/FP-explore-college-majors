7794751,5,0976731053,"Oh my gosh - this is just so awesome!! We do neighborhood campfires all summer and really miss them during the Wisconsin winters. We had everyone over for New Years Eve and I surprised them with this DVD. It was a hit. This truly is a gorgeous DVD. I highly recommend it. It is just the sound of the fire, birds, nature. LOVE IT",1483747200,,328,4.140625
7794752,1,0976731053,I bought this DVD to have a campfire only on my TV screen.instead I got a beautiful stream running over rocks with a campfire on the edge. I also got just a beautiful stream running over rocks and no campfire. What I ordered what's the fire to fill my TV screen.,1483142400,2,262,4.1568627450980395
7794753,4,0976731053,"It's not quite what I had in mind, but I like it. I somehow didn't realize that it would have music, and I really just want to hear fire. Also, I find the view of the riverbank and the river a little distancing. I prefer the campfire in the dark segment because it seems more immediate. It adds a nice ambiance to my room. The rushing river segment is nice, but I probably won't use or watch it. I think for me, I might have been better off with a fireplace dvd, and I will look for that next.",1476835200,6,493,3.98989898989899

7794755,5,0976731053,"Great realistic picture. We feel warm, while watching, just like we are there. Great for rv camping & those with allergies to smoke. Perfect way to enjoy a campfire inside, when you don't have a fireplace.",1453939200,3,205,4.722222222222222
7794756,5,0976731053,"There are quite a few fireplace videos out now, but this one is different and as far as I can tell, completely unique.

This is for the person who loves camping and the outdoors, and misses the peaceful feeling of sitting outside watching and listening to a campfire. (It was made and edited so skillfully that I swear I can smell it, too.)

The disk actually contains 5 different videos: a daytime campfire, a daytime campfire with music, a nighttime campfire, a nighttime campfire with music, and a lovely bonus track, Mountain Stream.

The daytime campfire was shot along a rocky riverbank with lush greenery on the far bank. You can hear the sound of the river and the crackling of the fire equally well, along with the occasional bird song you'd expect to hear in this setting, and can even see the smoke and the heat rising from the fire as it burns down over the course of an hour.

I was afraid that once the music was added to this scene, it would drown out the sounds of the fire and the river, but somehow it doesn't. Instead, it now feels like you're sitting around a campfire when your buddies break out the acoustic guitars: You can hear the music, and also the campfire, and the river and the birds. (These aren't identifiable tunes, but they're pleasant.)

The nighttime campfire begins after dusk, while it's still just barely light enough to make out that the fire is on a sandy beach with a river or creek in the background, which you can hear. Besides the fire, there are occasional sounds of a bullfrog, crickets, an owl, and a wolf or coyote howling (which totally faked out my cat). Just like when you're camping, it gets darker and darker as the fire burns down.

When you choose to add the music, it's once again acoustic strings, but different music than the track that goes with the daytime campfire; appropriately mellow and low-key for nighttime. It's my favorite music so far from the DVDs George Ford has made.

This disk is going to be getting a lot of playtime. It's perfect for when you want to get some work done and want some ""company"", but nothing that you have to pay attention to. The music and/or the sounds of the river and the fire make a nice background without distracting from the task at hand. If I had trouble sleeping, I think I'd copy just the audio and play that at night, which I'm guessing would be better than the white noise machines because it sounds absolutely realistic -- because it's the real thing.",1389830400,10,2458,4.5225225225225225
