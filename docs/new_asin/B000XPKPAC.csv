8228903,1,B000XPKPAC,"Every time I attempt to watch these videos I'm utterly amazed they ever got published, as mentioned by another reviewer, clearly `Wayne Robson' is capable of producing good work using zBrush in his own time, but when it comes to communication and professionally making and presenting video tutorials he is utterly hopeless.  For example, he clearly makes no attempt at preparing what-so-ever so essentially has utterly no idea what he is really talking about which is painful to listen to, he just makes it up as he goes along, through which he frequently forgets technically how you use zbrush to do something he is trying to describe, at which point he makes up some stupid pointless anecdote to try and lead you away from the fact that he doesn't really know what he's talking about.  As a lecturer in digital media (i.e. having spent years communicating technical processes to students) I feel embarrassed for him and Kurv studios for that matter putting their name to this.  It is true though that the earlier zBrush release by 'Glen Southern' is of a completely different calibre (i.e. he knows what he's talking about and is very clear and professional in his execution). So basically if you want to spend a silly amount of money being told by some 'caveman' that the brushes in zbrush, do what their name suggests they do, then go ahead, but honestly this video is absolutely terrible! There really is so much better material out there for free online, so if you want some quality tuition I would recommend you head over to `Gnomon' which is taught by professionals who know what they are talking about (i.e. no comment)so the moral of this story is: AVOID ANYTHING FEATURING `Wayne Robson' LIKE THE PLAGUE - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",1267142400,,1740,4.793333333333333
8228904,1,B000XPKPAC,"This video is for a program that he lost his license to use.
Now he only uses Mudbox because of it.

He has since been kicked off of the Zbrush/Pixologic Server after posting my 3D assets without permission.
He also enjoys talking down to you instead of taking pride in teaching you.

DO NOT SUPPORT HIM.",1251158400,,304,4.410714285714286
8228905,3,B000XPKPAC,"This DVD was of much more value after reviewing the Pixologic Introduction Videos and the Glen Southern Video which both do an excellent job explaining functionality and beginning concepts of ZBrush. The Glen Southern Video is dated to ZBrush 2 but the basic similarities to 3.1 are close enough that it is worth buying. Similarly I would also suggest purchasing the Introducing ZBrush book by Eric Keller. It has become a life line for me when I get stuck on a specific task I want to implement.

 The author of this DVD assumes that you have basic knowledge of the interface terminology and discusses much more from a workflow rather than functionality perspective how to use the application. If you are used to applications such as Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel Draw, Vue, TrueSpace or 3ds Max then it is wise to learn the ZBrush definitions, for the creators of ZBrush in some cases ignore industry standards. An example which I found to be a common source of puzzlement is the term ""layer"" which has the equivalent definition of ""subtool"" in ZBrush. Unfortunately, the makers of the ZBrush product tend to make it that much harder for those of us used to using more mature packages to quickly pick up their nomenclature. I suspect that someone over at Pixologic has figured this is a major stumbling block for new ZBrush users or they wouldn't give away so many tutorials for free. The free Pixologic tutorials are excellent to understand the basic concepts but are too disjointed to show how to produce a complete piece of work. This DVD and its Second Part do a much better job at that.

Once you understand the basic lingo this particular DVD becomes of much more use in actually how to use the product and produce work. Using both this Part1 and Part 2 I have gotten some astonishing results in a very short period of time but found that I needed to get the lingo and basic functionality down first before this DVD was of much value.

I would have rated the DVD higher but felt that some of the narration contained personal irrelevancies to the tutorial topics which could have been substituted for more informational content. Although I can appreciate the attempt to personalize the presentation my purchase was for the technique information.",1214697600,,2258,4.782051282051282
8228906,1,B000XPKPAC,"The instructor definitely knows Zbrush......but his teaching method is lacking. He's not focused, and has a tendency to bounce around the interface while chatting away. You're not always aware of what he's clicking, which is quite frustrating. His mouse is moving all about but you have no clue as to why. This is more of a ""watch me do this"", rather than a ""here's how we do this"" video. I've got both Vol. 1 and 2 of 'Get Into Zbrush' and would not recommend either. His `Intro to the interface' portion is basically a ""Click here to do this, and click this to do that......and to do this other thing? I'll touch on that later."" It would've been wiser to start with a simple object and work up, explaining each function by example. Again, he knows the app, but his teaching method is counter-productive.",1204675200,6,805,4.597222222222222
8228907,1,B000XPKPAC,Don't expect to pop this in and autoplay.  It's not a true DVD with chapters.  It's a series of Quicktime files.  The sound does not work on a MAC BOOK with the latest version of quicktime and leopard installed.  For this price - I expect a lot more.,1200268800,,250,4.145833333333333
