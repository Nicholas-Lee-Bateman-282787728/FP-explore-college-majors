1358773,4,B00004VVOJ,"Bubble Gum Crisis 2040 is a show about 3 women who can put on hardsuits (body armor) and fight against a type of android that has the chance of going crazy called Boomers. These boomers are all over the city because  they were created to help clean up after a major earth quake. After the  quake people bought these boomers for labor and such, but they flip out  sometimes and can change forms to become vicious monsters and wreak havoc  on the city. That's where the girls of bubble gum crisis come in and do  their thing. The animation is incredible and it actually carries a descent  story line. I would recommend it for those who like the sci-fi and fun of  the robotic battles.",964569600,,682,4.408
1358774,3,B00004VVOJ,"Well, The Knight Sabers are back, but I don't know if I can say better than ever... Actually, a 3 star rating is possibly a bit unfair of me-- plots, characters, art, and animation for BGC 2040 are first rate, BUT I have the misfortune of being too much of a BGC 2032 fan, perhaps. Out of five stars, subtract one for character design (no, I don't mean art). All the names are the same, but the personalities seem much more shallow in the remake, especially Sylia and the Genom folks. Also, the boomers have been dumbed down signifigantly. Subtract another star for plot and ambiance; the new series lacks the depth of the old. MegaTokyo itself has lost a lot of its personality-- it's not nearly as ""dark."" I think that many of the differences can be attributed to the design of BGC 2040 as a TV series; the target audience is different than that of the direct-to-video BGC 2032, and thus the creators couldn't get away with some of the things done in the original.
If you are just getting into BGC, I would recommend watching the 2040 series first, then going back to the original 2032 stuff; moving the other direction makes adjustment difficult. Without exposure to BGC 2032, 2040 becomes excellent anime. I wish though that JVC had put their money into assembling the original writers / artists / cast to finish off the last 5 episodes of BGC 2032, as Crash! was a pathetic effort, and the original series had more promise than the new. One caveat; this review comes 12 episodes into the new series; maybe something will happen that will change my mind, or the new series will grow on me, we'll see. It's nice to see continuation of the BGC concept, which was cast adrift way too early... Overall, worth watching, your mileage may vary.",984355200,6,1741,4.565495207667731
1358775,4,B00004VVOJ,"The animation is pure eye candy and well worth the admission price.  The story was fun, and I really got into it after the first episode(the DVD has 4 episodes).  Watch out for the english translation of the lead character's singing... its a painful experience.  Overall, this dvd is a keeper.",982368000,,293,4.705882352941177
1358776,5,B00004VVOJ,This is an awesome continuation of the classic series. The animation is emmaculate and you are never out of the action. Priss is the 'best' as usual. This is a must buy for BGC fans.,981244800,,182,4.228571428571429
1358777,4,B00004VVOJ,"First of all, let me say that everything I'm about to write is based on nothing more than the first four episodes of Bubblegum Crisis 2040 contained on this DVD.  A lot of my opinions might very well have to be changed if I see more of it.
If I am to judge this series by itself - it's very good anime.  One of the strongest aspects of this series, I believe, is the animation.  Incredibly sharp images - aided by tons of computer animation I'm sure - tell of the genesis of the vigilante/mercenary group Knight Sabers.  In this incarnation, Linna plays a central role (under the ""profiles"" section in extras, she is labeled as - believe it or not - the ""wild card of the group"").  Four characters - Sylia, Linna, Priss, and Nene - are all sharply drawn, not only visually, but in terms of personality as well.  The fighting is sharp and violent - visually highly exciting and enjoyable, if regrettably tend to be somewhat short in duration.  Overall, the atmosphere of the series comes quite close to AD Police - a vision of the future that is very dark and painful.  The suffering, the inner turmoil of the characters is almost an tangible thing - it gives them great depth that far surpasses most TV show characters, live or animated.  The story is shaping up to be good as well: somewhat Batman-esque (what with the secret hideout and aging loyal servant and all), fighting against the ominous looking ""Tower"" that is Genom.  The opening and closing animation are probably the best I've ever seen.  Especially the closing animation - which shows random images on a TV screen that sometimes go blank - inexplicably evokes the memory of the movie ""Strange Days"" and William Gibson's famous opening line in ""Neuromancer"" in me.
If - and I'm sure this is what 90% of you are interested in hearing - I'm to judge this series relative to the original BGC 2032, I'll still say this is a very good anime.  But no more than quite a few other ""very good"" animes out there.  No, it's not GREAT, like the original.  I still remember the first time the stage lights came on in ""Hot Legs"" and Priss opened the greatest anime series ever with a exhilarating performance of ""Tonight Hurricane.""  You can just feel it - there's something magical in the air.  This time?  It's like discovering a favorite childhood toy that you had thought you lost years ago: it looks familiar, feels familiar, even sounds familiar - but the feeling, the joy, the magic that enveloped you all those years ago when you first received it, is gone forever.
Many other reviewers have commented on how the characters have changed.  I completely agree.  Linna is a much better character now: lively, forceful, somewhat insecure but never shy to let her thoughts be known.  However, as far as I'm concerned, Priss and Sylia - the two most importantly and beloved Sabers in 2032 - have just been uttered ruined.  The Priss we have come to love - passionate, emotional, somewhat of a loose-cannon, a ""shoot-first-ask-question-later"" but very caring in a ""I-don't-want-to-admit-it-unless-forced-to"" kinda gal - has just vanished.  The new Priss has a face cold as her hardsuit and hardly ever utters a word.  Sylia in 2032 is one of most sublime characters ever in anime.  She is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere, pulling strings behind the scene while providing a much-needed psychological anchor for the other three.  Her beauty emanates from an almost unshakable sense of control, confidence, and subtle strength.  The new Sylia not only couldn't serve as a quiet anchor to others, she could hardly get a firm grasp on herself.  Seemingly suffering from some form of bipolar disorder, one moment she is cheerful like Nene, another she explodes in inexplicable rage. The only Saber who hasn't changed much is Nene.  But this really is a bad thing, since her ""comic relief"" role here just seems horribly out of place in this world so full of pain and anger.  Leon, the happy-go-lucky policeman in 2032, now for some reason constantly displays positively frightening anger.  Even the Tower is different now: the old Tower reeks of arrogance, but its color and lights blends in with the rest of the city very well, especially during night; the new Tower seems to have no sense of subtlety.  It's practically screaming at the viewers: ""I'm incredibly evil!""
One could go on and on about such things.  But please don't get the impression that all these add up to be a bad anime.  It's just not THE Bubblegum Crisis anymore.  I doubt if anything can be THE BGC again.  Sometimes when the magic is gone, I guess there is just nothing one can do.",980553600,9,4605,4.70661672908864
1358778,4,B00004VVOJ,"I really loved the original of the series, but I was a little disappointed with the re-make.  If you are a true fan of the original, then you may cringe at the changes made to the characters.  Especially, the fact that they made Linna so wimpy and that Mackie, (Sylia's perverted brother) was nowhere to be seen.  The music on the re-make was pumpin', but I thought that the music on the original was better.  Priss also had a better personality on the original series. Other than that, if you haven't seen the original, then I would recommend this DVD, for the animation quality is great, but if you truly loved the original, then be warned that this is not a sequel (although it would have made a good prequel) and that you may be in for a surprise.",977961600,,751,4.381294964028777
1358779,4,B00004VVOJ,"A short description of Bubblegum Crisis 2040 is armored female vigilantes called the Knight Sabers battling humanoid robots gone bad.  This DVD contains the first 4 episodes (out of 26 or so).  It is an interesting introduction to this series, and sets out the differences between it and the original Bubblegum Crisis.  (This and the original are two entirely different stories.)  There is some good action, the acting is fair to good in the English dub (although Nene's voice actress has an unappealing voice), and the story starts to move fairly quickly.  The animation is fluid for a television show, and the hard suits (the Knight Sabers' armor) looks great.  The best description of the character designs I can think of is that they're sterile--they really lack life, especially Priss.  They aren't ugly, but there is something missing; it's hard to describe.
In addition to the character designs, the characters themselves are not terribly appealing in these first 4 episodes.  Nene is childish and silly; the little we see of Sylia suggests she is flighty; and Priss is all but autistic in how far she is detached from the people around her.  Linna is the only appealing character of the main four, mostly for her determination.  For these first four episodes, the characters aren't a problem--we're just meeting them and we don't know that much about them, so the problems may resolve themselves.  But this isn't a disc you're likely to walk away from dying to know what happens to these characters.  It gets 4 stars overall because basically everything except the characters is 5 star quality.",974246400,3,1602,4.9588014981273405
1358780,5,B00004VVOJ,"I haven't been an anime fan too long, but since I have, the Bubblegum Crisis series has been my favorite. I thought the original 8 OVA's were great, but this new series is much better. The characters have been changed a little bit in design but their personalities are pretty similar. The story is a different, in that it's more of a retelling of the OVA's story from even before the original series began, despite the year's differences from 2032 to 2040. The animation is well done, and the music is also great, I'd recommend buying the soundtrack.
The DVD contains the main languages, English, Spanish and Japanese with English Subtitles. The main menu screen contains a list of the episodes, and a  section with a brief description of each of the characters with a short running of animated sequences of the character in the episodes and music, unfortunately they're not the complete songs. Also, since these are episodes there's a few seconds where a small screen comes up before and after where commercials would be shown.
These are only minor details, and I would definitely not let it stand in the way of you buying this DVD, even if it did not have previews, or character info. The animation and story is good enough to buy. This is a must have for any anime fan, no matter what else you're seen.",973900800,3,1305,4.625
1358781,4,B00004VVOJ,The animation of this BGC is the same (if not better) than the previous one.  How ever the characters are not the same.  Possibly diferent people were at the helm of the story.  None the less the animation is good.,970617600,,214,4.3
1358782,4,B00004VVOJ,"this is still a striking series, with beautiful animation, and the same punk feeling of BGC2032 and bubblegum crash...but it's different.
the big  difference is character development. priss is much more severe than in  2032, and is almost mean to everyone concerned. nene is at times the same  old nene, but seems to have lost a lot of her trademark incompetence. She's  also a bit more assertive, playing a little give and take game with leon at  AD police. linna isn't even a member when the series starts, but she ends  up being much stronger than she ever was in 2032, and finally, sylia is a  little bit of an airhead, and much more of an emotional woman.
still  great, with a terrific opening theme (called ""y'know""), this is  worth the money.
one other big bother...nene taunts leon with the name  ""leon-poo,"" which ends up just being an incredibly bad  translation of ""leon-chan."" that's real annoying, especially  since i like to have subtitles on.
only reason this didn't get four stars  is becuase of the character differences, which i don't think mesh quite  right with BGC2032.",969408000,6,1090,4.790322580645161
1358783,5,B00004VVOJ,"Bubblegum crisis 2040
what to say, its gosh darnit brilliant, its  probably the best anime series and most perfect viewing you can have this  year (so far of course).
Its like the original series, only better,  better animation, better characters, better story, better music, unless you  hold particular afffection for songs that sound uncannily like 'i need a  hero' homages.
The 3 main characters, linna, priss and nene are the  wearers of the 'hard-suits' which make them serious fighting machines to  save the country for rogure boomers, robots gone out of control. The plot  is starts of about linna joining the knight sabers and movs swiftly onto  the problems with the boomers, and who is making them go crazy.
Theres  something for everyone here, a character everyone can relate to. Bubblegum  2040 is anime at its best, watch it, or you'll never know what your  missing.",968630400,7,879,4.945205479452055
7924205,5,B00004VVOJ,Bought this a long time ago. I liked it.,1495756800,,40,3.5555555555555554
7924206,5,B00004VVOJ,"First a word about the seller. They contacted me a while after the package arrived with an automated e-mail, asking if everything was OK, and soliciting seller feedback. The email contained a link for customer care, and a link for seller feedback. This is a nice touch, and a timesaver.

About the items: If you are buying this in 2017 (or later) you already know all there is to know about BCG2040. I'll be a nice addition to your collection, or to scratch your nostalgia itch.

This collection is inconsistent in the DVD menu, and the chapter divisions may be better, but otherwise, is ok, on par with (or slightly better than) the BGC2040 you remember watching on a CRT TV in the late '90s

*** Two words of advice. ***

1.) There is a newer version of this collection, with slightly improved graphics, and massively improved sound (from 2.1 to 5.1). Unless you are a Packrat, the new collection is the safer bet.

2.) BUT, the new collection DOES NOT HAVE a Spanish dub. If you want/need the SPANISH dub, this is the collection you want!!!!.

I'll repeat in spanish:
Hay una nueva coleccion de BCG2040 con mejores graficos y muchisimo mejor audio, pero sin el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol. Si quieres o necesitas el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol, esta es la coleccion que debes comprar.",1493251200,,1283,4.68
7924207,5,B00004VVOJ,"In the year 2040, Tokyo is booming again after the great earthquake. Humanoid machines called boomers have rebuilt the city and it's better than ever. Except for 1 little detail. Some of the boomers go out of control and attack people. Along with the A.D. Police, the Knight Sabers are a vigilante group that destroy the rogue boomers. What these 5 women are doing is noble, but the police don't like having their toes stepped on. Despite that, the Knight Sabers are the best equipped to deal with the problem. They don't have any idea that a sinister plot is in the works. A plot so devious, that maybe even they won't be able to save the planet.

Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 300 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it.

7924208,2,B00004VVOJ,"Bubblegum Crisis was one of the giants of 80s anime and for many American fans one of the first to win their hearts.  This 1999 reboot redesigns some of the characters, alters some details but is not really an improvement on the original.

It really doesn't do anything new with the idea or the characters and feels like a rerun with lazier animation and story-telling.  I'd recommend checking out the original and skipping this retread.",1298851200,,437,4.8
7924209,1,B00004VVOJ,"The orginal 8 episode Bubblegum Crisis is a masterpiece of great futuristic anime and one of my all time favorites. The art in this new version 2040 is a total insult to the franchise and looks worse than the Flintstones or Scooby-Doo. I mean you have these monsters that look like a paper cut out with a couple of holes and bolt, and none of the great writing that came with the original. I almost never bash anime but in this case the art is so bad it deserves it. It is like someone just picked up the title to make a quick yen and spent no time, money, or thought on it because they were counting on the fame of the original to sell it. I am sure they made their money because of that but this is truly the worst quality anime I have ever seen, yes, the worst. Don't reward these makers of junk who insult the awesome original Bubblegum Crisis.",1268352000,,848,4.176829268292683
7924210,5,B00004VVOJ,"Bubblegum Crisis: Toyko 2040 Vol. 1 has the first four episodes of this modern remake of the original OVA.  The episodes are:

1. Can't Buy a Thrill

2. Fragile

3. Keep Me Hanging On

4. Machine Head

Bubblegum Crisis 2040 is an action-packed, futuristic, techno, cyber-punk, female-centered anime, with some additional elements of mystery and family.  The hard-driving, pulse-pounding music blends seamlessly with the breathtaking action scenes.

Volume One centers mainly on the changes Linna goes through as she wants to become one of the Knight Sabres.  The Knight Sabres are a group of female vigilantes in high-powered robotic suits.  Viewers can really relate to and root for Linna. The pretty young woman is beginning a tedious desk job at a mega-corporation in Tokyo.  Linna is from the country and unused to the big-city life. A highly unpleasant chance encounter during lunch break on her first day of work leads to an adventure she never dreamed of.

This first volume is a little slow moving as it is mostly character development.  Many other characters are introduced, including Priss, Sylia, and Nene, the other members of the Knight Sabre team.  Priss is the hard-boiled, street-smart punk singer who gives Linna the hardest time.  Nene is the bubbly computer whiz whose day job is with the Police Department.  Nene is an inside spy, as the police hate and want to capture the Knight Sabres.  And Sylia is the beautiful, wealthy, and mysterious power and purse of the vigilante team.

The Knight Sabres fight rougue Boomers, that is, robots who have mysteriously gone haywire and are wreaking havoc.  Sylia has a deep-seated hatred of robots.  More about that will be revealed in volume two.",1094083200,,1708,5.01067615658363
7924211,4,B00004VVOJ,"I've always been curious about this show, so when I finally took the plunge and bought it, I was pleased to find myself not disappointed.
We are introduced to this series through Linna, who has come to Tokyo under the pretense of getting a job, but who is actually looking for the Night Sabers. Why? She wants to join, of course! These early episodes are a little slow, but still good, as we learn about Tokyo and the Night Sabers through Linna's eyes. It almost feels as if the viewer is trying to join the Night Sabers, too.
Things pick up when Linna goes into battle with her hardsuit for the first time, but of course it's never that easy as her newly-built suit malfunctions, leaving her at the mercy of a rogue boomer.
So far, things are looking interesting, as we are introduced to characters and get subtle hints at future mysteries. I was looking forward to the next volume after this, but the slowness of this volume might turn some people off. If you don't like it, at least give volume 2 a chance - that's where things get more interesting. Recommended.",1069027200,,1065,4.494845360824742
7924212,4,B00004VVOJ,"The year is 2040 (as if you couldn't tell) and the Knight Sabers are back in their very own 26 episode TV series! Nene is still a lovable hacker ditz, Sylia's still the mysterious leader, and Priss is still the kind of girl you really don't want to take home to mother. In this new reincarnation of the golden age classic, one character, Linna is pretty different from her late 1980's early 1990's counterpart. Considering how Linna's personality from the original series wasn't really all that memorable, that's not a problem.
The plotline starts to unfold along similar lines. The 'rogue boomers' are the centerpiece of the early episodes, the characters make friends and fight crime, and Genom lurks in the background. About half way through the series, however, the climax approaches, simplicity begins to give way to a much deeper story, and mysteries about the entire team are revealed. And really, some of them are truly Evangelion worthy revelations.
While this new Bubblegum Crisis boosts great J-Rock music, good character designs, and excellent color and animation, 2040 is a successful series because it combines the better elements of the late 80's anime, with the more challenging plotlines of the post Evangelion era. While some critics will point that it panders to the audience, a little pandering now and then is healthy. Yet more critics will be befuddled that a series could be in one episode described as ""cute, trashy fun"" can turn into something closer to ""cerebral thrill ride"".
All in all, what fandom has on its hands here is a very good series, with a little of everything. ""Tokyo 2040"" is not a fine wine, like a studio Ghlibi film might be, but maybe it can be a tall, refreshing mug of beer. Or, if you prefer, a sweet glass of Coca-Cola.

7924214,3,B00004VVOJ,"Most of the reviews I have read have made at least some comparison to the original Bubblegum Crisis series, which I haven't seen.  From that point of view, here's what I have to say about this DVD:
This is good anime.  Not great, but good.  If you are a recent anime convert, this wouldn't be the first disc to buy, but if you're a hardcore fan you'll probably want it eventually.
The story (at least so far) struck me as Power Ranger-esque, but infinitely cooler, and with a lot more estrogen.  The characters seem to be a bit too cliche; including the childish ""comic relief"" Nene and the brooding loner Priss.  I felt that (at least on the first disc) they devoted a lot more time to Linna than the other characters.  I also felt that they didn't leave much room for depth in the characters, but perhaps that will change as the series progresses.
The characters' appearance is what you expect from anime, namely, the female characters are tall, buxom, and long legged, and the male characters have impossibly large chests.
The DVD's video quality is exceptional, and the audio is quite good as well.  The English dub is (for the most part) accurate, although the voices aren't as good as the Japanese.  I would recommend (as usual) that you first watch it in Japanese with subtitles first to get the full effect.
Overall, I am pleased with this disc, but the rest of this series will likely wait until I have finished off some of the other series I am collecting.",993427200,2,1466,4.547528517110266
