Dan Terry loved Jesus with his whole heart and loved the people of Afghanistan.  Tragically, that is where he lost his life.  A real life martyr ~ hero.  A story that needs to be heard.",1511827200,,315,4.271186440677966
7793059,5,0836196546,"I just watched this dvd on ABC this morning.  It is a wonderful moving story.  Dan sets a high mark for mankind and he  proves his worth by his actions.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves life, has a religious belief of the world united (probably never gonna happen), and follows his heart.  He lived what he believed and passed on to the Afghan culture that not all men are different.  We can be united in our spirit and love of our country..wherever we may be. But the most moving part was his gift of adventure, joy and kindness.",1351382400,4,545,4.294117647058823
