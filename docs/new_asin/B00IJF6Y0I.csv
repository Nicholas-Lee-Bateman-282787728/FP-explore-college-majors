8642544,5,B00IJF6Y0I,"Released in 1961 this is a beautifully made and artfully shot piece of cinema. The plot is pretty simple in that playboy Nello (Marcello Mastroianni) is arrested at home and asked to go to the police station. Once there they are slow to reveal why he is being questioned. It soon transpires that his former, older lover has been murdered. Bad news for him is that he is suspect number one and they ain't looking too hard for a number two.

Then we start to get the back story told in flashback and soon the past is getting closer to the present day. That is when clever and imaginative camera work starts to blend the past with the now in some brilliant ways. This was cameraman Carlo di Palma who was a favourite of Woody Allen.

The question throughout is did he or didn't he - is he just a bit of a cad or a manipulative killer. And I have to say that the balance is done just right making your loyalties ebb and flow with the turning of the scenes. Superbly directed by Elio Petri and with music from Henri Salvador - who has a style that seems to have influenced Henri Mancini. For the time it was made it is a technical and artful marvel. Time has been fairly kind too in that it still has a universal theme of where the good ends and the bad takes off and I have to say I really enjoyed it. This is the fully restored edition and it has been done lovingly - bringing the whole film to life with an immediate vibrancy. In Italian with very good sub titles, this is one for Euro cinephiles and those who love cinema history.",1446249600,4,1529,4.215017064846417
