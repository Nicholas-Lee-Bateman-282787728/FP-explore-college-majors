8097105,4,B000CCD256,"Well let me start off by saying...high art it ain't! Firstly ..I do not know why this film was made. I don't know if it was to promote Dr. Wollman's practice, bring general awareness to the publuc about Transgender people, or just blatantly exploit them like sideshow freaks.

Leslie, the main Trans woman in the film is fabulous. She's beautiful, determined and profound. She came basically from nothing in Puerto Rico, and explains in detail what it was like growing up with her feelings, and even about her contemplation of suicide. I had to admire the tenacity of the woman, because she accomplished what she set out to do.

Other parts of the film are quite gross and graphic. Stock footage of vaginas being constructed, the doctor examing Transgender vaginas, simulated sex scenes, and a whole lot more lol.

The one thing positive I can say about this film is that it may assist someone should they be struggling with this. They can see all the ups and downs in transitioning. It may be overdramatic at times and even camp, but I think their intentions were in the right place even though they exploited these women.

You know what they say...You can't be exploited unless YOU allow it. I mean no one is forcing any of those women to be on The Real Housewivess shows.

Just be warned...this film can be quite graphic at times. I do not recommend it for ANYONE under 18.",1455235200,3,1376,4.622950819672131
8097106,3,B000CCD256,"This is nothing but an exploitation movie about transsexuals narrated by a ""specialist in the field"" (Dr Leo Wollman) with a large portion of dialoge coming from a very passable and pretty transsexual named  (Leslie). Most of the other people under going (sex change therapy) ""as it was called back then"" are unconvincing as the opposite sex save a couple.

It's almost a porno film ,even porn star (Harry Reems) of Deep Throat fame is in it ,as they reinact how a trans woman has sex too soon and he leaves her in a small pool of blood after intercourse. They actually show a full sex change surgery blow by blow. Then show the results weeks after with her spread eagle! I must say they have certainly come along way in the surgery department! Now with the new technology the vagina is  aesthetically pleasing and one would never know it was created and not genetic.

But this film is just for shock value although most of the information as to the mindset of transgender individuals is accurate. Not for the squeamish or closed minded.",1435017600,6,1037,4.619565217391305
8097107,1,B000CCD256,I have yet to receive this movie item.  What is the delay? It was ordered back in December before Christmas!,1358121600,2,108,4.4
8097108,4,B000CCD256,This movie was interesting. It's not what I thought it would be but it was interesting none the less. The movie was a little older than I would have liked but it was very indepth in changing from one gender to the othere. If you want to know about going from man to woman this is for you and wanted to see how a man penis is removed and a new vagina is made this is for you also.,1302307200,6,379,3.810126582278481
8097109,5,B000CCD256,It was an intresting docu/movie I never seen this before it is too shocking to gore it will scare any men it crazy ..,1297555200,3,117,3.9166666666666665
8097110,3,B000CCD256,Let Me Die a Woman is pure grindhouse trash about transexuality.  It pretends to be a documentary but is really just exploitative like Mondo Cane.  It is also hilarious trash!  Not for everyone though and quite gross at times.,1254700800,5,226,4.743589743589744
