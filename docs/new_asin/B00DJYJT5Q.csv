Damages: The Complete Series is maybe the cheapest complete series I've ever owned. All of the DVDs are stacked on top of one another and they give you a cardboard insert to keep them in. I was very disappointed in them for putting this together and expecting fans to enjoy it. You'd be better off buying the seasons separately.",1386892800,49,503,4.538461538461538

5820692,5,B00DJYJT5Q,Best written and acted show ever.  Glenn Close is amazing.  I'll never understand why this show wasn't the most watched show on TV.  I can't say enough about the quality of this show.  Watch and learn.,1384992000,9,201,4.5
5820693,4,B00DJYJT5Q,the show is fantastic - which is why i bought the box set--the show gets five stars--the way the dvds are packaged is TERRIBLE !!!!!  fifteen disks all stacked on top of each other--why do they make box sets like this---CHEAP !!--actually i almost gave this three stars just because of how the disks are stacked on top each other--but i  did not want to take away from how great the show is--i will be keeping the 15 disks in other jewel cases while i watch the shows---,1383004800,52,470,4.329545454545454

5820729,1,B00DJYJT5Q,"This is a one star review, for now, for only the incredibly stupid DVD packaging from the owner of the title series. I will amend the review for content soon enough. The set came today, purchased for my wife and I to binge with, heard it was a really good show. I diligently open things up when they arrive to make sure all is as it should be. What I can't believe is that all 15 discs are on one spindle in a book type box. This is a new low in cheapness. As far as I am concerned, Sony's name is on the box and the fault with this absurd marketing decision lies strictly with Sony, not the vendor or Amazon. Its stupefying to me to think I am expected to remove 10, 11, 12 (pick a number) loose discs EACH TIME as we get near the final discs of this series, like I am a clown juggler or a plate spinner on the Ed Sullivan show. Hard to believe this isn't a bootleg import. Dont know yet if all the discs even play correctly. I can only hope the brain trusts who thought of this have long since been guided to new careers, hopefully not in the food service industry.",1486944000,5,1067,4.037735849056604

No protection for any of the discs or anything. Includes no booklet or anything on the case explaining if there are any special features or anything. I would have thought the packaging would have been more like an HBO or Showtime release who offer great packaging. If you can score all individual seasons cheap, do that instead.

5820835,5,B00DJYJT5Q,"5 perfect seasons of a singular, human, hyper-realistic depiction of the duality inherent to power: jealousy and paranoia.

Glenn Close is absurdly amazing as an absurdly powerful and nearly untouchable lawyer who decides to demolish bad people getting away with their bad deeds. If she has to do some badness to make the world at large a better place, she can't become so bothered as to stop now. It's too late.

Rose Byrne is the likewise no-bulls***-taking young lawyer seeking to become and have everything that Glenn Close has, but of course on her own terms. With her college sweetheart med-school super-in-debt fianc, she's struggling with the questions of life paths: do you have to sacrifice power and wealth for family, and do you have to sacrifice family for true power and wealth?

The entire series becomes the embodiment of that duality in power: the jealousy of those who want power vs. the paranoia of losing it for those who already have it.

What this show does better than most is that it takes a high-stakes dramatic concept and firmly grounds it in reality. Deaths are real, and rare, but deeply shocking and disturbing. Most, if not all, of this show is based around 2 deaths, that's it. 5 seasons dedicated to pain and paranoia and hate and revenge and deceit and misdirection and manipulation, because of two deaths.

Whereas a show like CSI or Law and Order, or even something sillier like the heavenly slices of Shondaland, will have multiple deaths per episode, ""Damages"" reins it all in to a kind of simple earnestness that really can grip you with the question of what would you actually do if _____ was murdered because you were trying to win a high-stakes case?

Something that Kerry Washington might deal with inbetween wine bottles in a single episode, becomes something that defines Rose Byrne's entire life's purpose for 5 seasons.

I know it can sound like that might be boring, but it actually affords a strangely deep kind of philosophical approach to drama. Yes, it's a contrived show and the scenarios are convenient for each episode, but there really is a weighty realism that they face in all their choices and decisions. There's no magical murder guy like Huck to send sneaking in to extort the evidence from someone, if they wanna win a case, it takes them months and months.

They dedicate entire episodes to preparing for on-tape interviews and then entire episodes to actually having those interviews. It becomes all about catching someone in a lie, even if it comes down to a single word. And if they happen to be going through a divorce, or custody battle, or dealing with a death of loved one in the background, that certainly pervades their day to day life. You don't just stop existing because you're at work, you can try and hide your feelings but we all crack.

And while it sadly all comes to an end, it has a very poignant and intense resolution.

Plus, now we have ""Bloodlines"" on Netflix to carry the torch and rebrand the realism into the odd swamps and family values of Florida -- and with a whole cast of amazingly amazing actors!

If you want epic acting, intense drama, and thoughtful realism, this is something you should not miss .... even though Glenn Close's son Michael is like an even more annoying and s***ty Patrick Bateman. But it's all so real !!!",1457136000,,3320,4.726643598615917

The first 2 seasons are fine and get you hooked,  but the language in the last seasons ruined the whole series.  I don't understand why the directors would ruin a good series with such distasteful language.  They didn't use it for the first two seasons so why change on the last three.

5820954,5,B00DJYJT5Q,"This is one of the top drama thriller series ever. Each episode kept me fully engaged, and continually surprised.
With these amazing writers story lines,  and riveting suspense , this series is amazing to binge watch.
Glenn Close is superb in her roll of Patty Hewes, a brilliant lawyer who continually struggles with integrity,
crossing lines, and planing the unthinkable.

Rose Byrne plays Ellen Parsons who gets hired by Patty Hewes her first job out of law school.
The work relationship of boss/protegee is seen evolving in every episode, until eventually each
is trying to out smart the other, and become deadly adversaries.

Hewes is full of clever angles that outwit or stun not only her associates but her clients and competition.
Ellen, who's actions are more limited by her ethics and integrity, finally realizes Patty is capable of anything.

Each guest star added solid grounding and brilliance throughout the series.

Martin Short, John Goodman, Jenna Elfman and Ryan Phillippe",1434153600,,1047,5.177514792899408

5821044,3,B00DJYJT5Q,"Really well acted drama but too much copying from season to season; it was much like watching the same show over and over with different actors playing the same roles. Using flash backs too much made for difficult following of the plot. Glenn Close is terrific and saved the series for me. If you like simple screenplays easy to follow, skip this one - way too much flash backs in all of the seasons.",1414195200,7,400,4.418918918918919

5821096,1,B00DJYJT5Q,"First of all let me say that the series is awsome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of suspense thriller. But out side of the show itself most of the discs (approximately 15 discs) were in some way dammaged: part of seasons two three and five and incredibly ever disc in season four.  The distributor, Warehouse Deals 4 Less clearly has no quality control checks in place!

You might wonder why I have not asked for my money back: Well,  I am so disgusted with the quality that I would not trust any replacement provided by the same distributor, Warehouse Deals 4 Less.  Plain and simple:  I learned a lesson and am not willing to review all of the discs again for quality.

5821098,3,B00DJYJT5Q,Like several of the reviewers I was very disappointed in the packaging of this boxed set. Looked good on the outside but DVD's stacked on top of each other with no protection in between are difficult to keep unscratched once in use. I will probably have to put them into individual packets or find some alternative while we are watching them. I am guessing you get what you pay for...The series is fantastic though and well recommended.,1400716800,3,436,4.675324675324675

It's the perfect blend of greed, control, hearbreak, violence, and backstabbing.  Who could ask for more.  The collection was perfectly packaged and all of the CD's pristine.  I'd highly recommend the entire series.  You could never stop at just one season.  The plotting, editing, and even the music is top-of-the-line.  It's a MUST HAVE.",1398556800,10,440,5.013888888888889
5821124,3,B00DJYJT5Q,"My wife has a mild hearing problem and finds watching movies on DVD much more enjoyable if there are subtitles.  While we're enjoying this series very much, the only subtitles available on the DVDs are in French.  If you stream the same series over Amazon Video there are English subtitles available.

Like another reviewer, I feel that the packaging of the 15 DVDs is notably cheap (15 DVDs stacked together with nothing to separate them).  Together with the lack of English subtitles, the package suggests a desperate attempt to cut costs.  My rating reflects an average of the good series and the poor packaging.",1398297600,3,615,4.875

5821127,5,B00DJYJT5Q,"For those of us who have suffered through long delays between seasons of DAMAGES, having the complete series available in one format is a wonderful thing. I found the plots and characters fascinating. The packaging on this set does leave alot to be desired--all the disks are stacked one on top of the other so every other reviewer that criticized that is absolutely right. But I bought it anyway for the opportunity to someday sit down and finally watch the whole series in order without the handicap of losing track of the plot between seasons or trying to track it down on yet another cable station/platform that it had moved to. Worth the wait.",1396742400,9,648,4.692982456140351

5821129,5,B00DJYJT5Q,"Off the top I have to say that four of the DVD's had freeze frame problems.  After watching the complete series we sent it back.  Two days later we had the new one.  Had I checked the return specifics I would have sent it back right away in order to make sure the second set didn't have the same issue.  That said, kudos to Amazon for its unbelievably fast mailing of our new DVD's.

As for the series itself I could not stop watching one episode after another.  My husband and I blew through it in less than two weeks.  It made having one of the coldest, snowiest winters in Minnesota history bearable.  :)  Glenn Close never disappoints and the rest of the cast was no different.

I loved the way you knew the ending of each episode at the beginning, then watched as they served you the details bit by bit, taking you this way and that, letting you wonder how it would all turn out while never revealing the season end until the actual last hour.  The storylines were intriguing and kept me coming back for more.

I very much appreciated that the first three seasons were clean - no use of the f-word, gratuitous sex or nudity, etc.  Then in the fourth and fifth seasons there was all of that.  Sooooo unnecessary.  I also wonder why Christians are almost always portrayed as hypocritical, hateful human beings.  That has not been my experience at all.

All in all it was a great series.  I now understand what all the accolades and awards were about.  I'll be passing it along to my friends and relatives for sure.",1394496000,8,1517,4.392086330935252

5821132,5,B00DJYJT5Q,"This is even better than Mad Men or Breaking Bad which are great too. It's just that Damages is so good I dream about it and it had an emotional  component that looms far after the episodes are over. No other TV show has had that impact on me. From the great theme song to Patti and Ellen's tense conversations , its perfect as a show gets. It has set the bar very high! I miss it immensely!",1393804800,2,391,4.012820512820513

5821138,4,B00DJYJT5Q,I won't put any spoilers in here. Let it just be said that the series is great television. It is flawed in spots by unnecessary inconsistencies and continuity problems. But it is well worth watching.,1391212800,,199,4.714285714285714
5821139,3,B00DJYJT5Q,"Great actors in the series, but a little slow paced for my liking. I get bored after a disk or 2. This complete set comes in a container that has all the disks packed onto a post of sorts rather than the usual fold out 'leafs.  That's ok for me as I have my own 'filing' system putting DVDs in crystal cases to save space, but if you want to view the final series in this item, you have to lift out all the earlier disks of earlier series first.
