5669675,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Jimmy will warm your heart, make you think and entertain you.  Will share with all my friends.  Robert Whitlow is an amazing writer and producer.  I am grateful to have known him and his family.",1375315200,,194,4.485714285714286
5669676,5,B00BRKYZVM,It was an excellent showing as to what someone with a handicap can do so much more when someone is willing to put confidence in them and show them love. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone. In fact it would strengthen our human race if we had more  compassion.,1374969600,12,272,4.333333333333333
5669677,4,B00BRKYZVM,This was a very good family movie. I hope you will enjoy it as much as our family did. Carl Tucker,1373932800,,98,3.7142857142857144
5669678,5,B00BRKYZVM,Wonderful story and great acting skill from a young man. Its a show for the whole family and great discussion points for our young people.,1373673600,,138,4.56
5669679,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Very highly recommended - one of the best dramas I have seen in a long time. (It would be ideal family viewing except for a few intense scenes -- for that reason, recommended for older children and up.)

The title character is played by Ian Colletti, who does a truly exceptional job playing a boy with special needs. The storyline involves family relationships (especially between a boy and his grandpa) and elements of faith (with no hint of moralism or preachiness). Special mention needs to be made of the cinematography, but all around this is a quality film: story, cast, sound/music - Loved it.",1373241600,18,601,4.778846153846154
5669680,4,B00BRKYZVM,"I would recommend reading the book, Jimmy by Robert Whitlow, before watching the movie.  The book (as all books are) is better than the movie, much more detail and character development.  But this was a really good movie made from a book.  The acting was excellent and I truly enjoyed it.",1372291200,12,288,4.607843137254902
5669681,5,B00BRKYZVM,"We watched this as a family last night and we just sat in silence when it was finished.  All I can say is WOW!  Fantastic cinematography, sound track, and acting.  The casting is over the top superb.  The screenwriting is well done - believable and draws you in immediately.  It is intense, yet fun; full of conflict, yet loving.  The use of irony throughout is extremely effective - just when you think you have it figured out, they flip you upside down and take you with them.  The most important thing I appreciate about this film is that it is wholesome and honors what is right.  There are no language or modesty issues or inappropriate scenes.  Those things aren't needed to make a top-notch film - and Jimmy is a prime example of that.  I highly recommend this film.",1370563200,43,773,4.496402877697841
5669682,1,B00BRKYZVM,"You will guess what's going to happen very early on in this slow film about a young boy who sees beings. Problem with Jimmy is that these beings don't play a significant part in the film til the very last moments and by that time it's SO expected as to be a big bore. Acting is OK, seeing a film that depicts the east coast of the US actually filmed on the east coast is a pleasure. (Filmmakers must think we're stupid, when they film in California where trees and mountains look NOTHING like North Carolina or Virginia). If you can see this free then go for it, otherwise don't consider paying money for this slight film",1520035200,,621,4.316239316239316
5669683,5,B00BRKYZVM,Well done!,1519862400,,10,4.5

5669688,4,B00BRKYZVM,Nice family film.,1519257600,,17,5.0
5669689,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Very good. I read the book a few years ago but did not know there was a movie until today. When I've read the book I go into watching a movie made from it with some trepidation. This time was no exception. However I was happily shown that this movie did not fall short of the novel. There is a strong cast, a strong story line and I highly recommend it.",1518912000,,353,3.9859154929577465
5669690,5,B00BRKYZVM,I must confess I'm at a loss in regards to the bad reviews some have given this film.  I find absolutely nothing wrong with this wonderful story of a special needs boy that has close communion with angels (watchers).  Having had encounters with angels myself I found this story not only touching but very believable.  .,1518912000,,319,4.660714285714286
5669691,1,B00BRKYZVM,I wish Amazon's description included the fact that this movie is full of religious BS.  It's a sophomoric waste of time.,1518480000,,120,4.714285714285714
5669692,5,B00BRKYZVM,Certainly worth your time to watch this.,1518393600,,40,4.857142857142857
5669693,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Excellent movie.  You seldom see a movie with distinctly Christian values that is neither preachy nor B rated.  This is top-notch entertainment with first-rate acting, directing, and script.  The only caveat is that it would be too intense for young children, but acceptable for teens and adults.",1518393600,4,296,5.25531914893617
5669694,5,B00BRKYZVM,"It's a very inspirational movie. In a time where violence and sexual immorality is promoted in movies like never before, this film is a breath of fresh air.",1518307200,,156,4.607142857142857
5669695,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Wonderful! Great acting, with action and a great plot. This is by far one of the best family friendly movies I've ever seen.",1518220800,,124,4.434782608695652
5669696,5,B00BRKYZVM,If everyone had a heart like Jimmy's the world would be a better place,1517616000,,70,4.071428571428571

5669702,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Absolutely loved this dramatic, touching movie. Good storyline, although predictable at times. A good, clean Family Movie!!",1515196800,,123,6.294117647058823

5669708,5,B00BRKYZVM,Very creative and enjoyable! Loved the actor playing Jimmy.,1512777600,,59,5.666666666666667
5669709,3,B00BRKYZVM,"Maybe I think too much.  I was prepared to enjoy this film, but it fell just a little flat for me. I'm assuming part of its intent was  to deliver some sort of message, but the ambiguities were muddy, rather than thought-provoking. Some of the scenes went on just a little too long, making it drag at times. However, if you have some free time, it is still an enjoyable movie, and it's great to see a young(er) Ian Colletti in this challenging role. Also, I always enjoy seeing Ted Levine!",1512518400,,489,4.362637362637362
5669710,3,B00BRKYZVM,I would have preferred if they actually hired a true mentally challenged actor.,1512172800,3,79,5.153846153846154

5669714,5,B00BRKYZVM,"This movie is excellent and my husband and I are pretty picky about Christian movies. You get so tired of the same old watered down predictable gloppy stuff.

5669719,5,B00BRKYZVM,"A wonderfully done film with fine acting, beautiful scenery, and a faithful message of hope, love, and kindness which endures even through the darkest of times. All of this comes through a mentally challenged teenaged boy who sees the unseen angels, he calls ""the watchers,"" as they help guide and direct his path. A well made Christian film for the whole family.",1495929600,2,363,4.870967741935484
5669720,5,B00BRKYZVM,Positive message. Engaging to watch.,1492819200,3,36,6.4
5669721,5,B00BRKYZVM,"I watched this on amazon video - I hadn't heard of it before. Jimmy is a mentally challenged (14 year old) boy, but because he sees ""watchers"" people think he's somewhat delusional. (Just because other people aren't sensitive enough to see ""watchers"" doesn't mean they aren't there.)  The movie is not fast paced, so if you're looking for a lot of action, look someplace else. This is a nice, sweet uplifting movie. I must say, the climax of the movie had me a bit on the edge of my seat.  Highly recommend. A nice, clean wholesome movie.",1492473600,5,538,4.536082474226804

5669724,5,B00BRKYZVM,Jimmy is a highly recommended film. Amazing inspirational film for the entire family. The acting was so spot on. The actor that plays Jimmy gave such an brilliant performance. Everyone should watch this movie.,1484179200,,209,5.176470588235294
5669725,5,B00BRKYZVM,Loved the book and loved the movie.  The endings are different but it was okay by me.  All of Robert Whitlow books are well-plotted and entertaining.  This one was especially good.,1479772800,,180,4.741935483870968
5669726,5,B00BRKYZVM,Maybe the best story that Robert Whitlow has written - - and he has written some great ones.,1479254400,,92,4.166666666666667

5669739,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Having been a teacher of special needs children and adults, and a cousin of one, I found this movie surprisingly well done. I am privy of many serious battles facing a diverse special needs population. ""Jimmy the movie"" encompasses many real and sometimes hateful circumstances often hidden from those outside the the context of our many Jimmys. Although I am not familiar with any of the related books, I have no hesitation to recommend the movie to anyone who has a heart for visual realistic dilemmas, a screenplay that has been purposefully designed to bring hope and encouragement to the audience.",1428192000,,602,4.97029702970297

5669741,4,B00BRKYZVM,"Good family movie. Kelly Carlson from Nip/Tuck is gorgeous, and does a fine job in a role that doesn't have her taking off her clothes. Lot of other fine performances from many television character actors. One intense (intimidation) scene may be a little much for younger viewers.

5669752,5,B00BRKYZVM,"My wife and I watched this movie.......and I must say I was biased because I like the work of Ted Levine and I had heard much good about the young boy who played Jimmy - an actor named Ian. He was tremendous - and the movie, like so many have written in this review section, was heart warming, suspenseful and tear jerking. I give much credit to the director, Mark Freiburger, for his use of the small rural town backdrop to portray this story and for helping me to really feel/know the characters. I have not read the book by Robert Whitlow, but plan on doing so. This is a great movie for people who love family movies with Spiritual/Faith in God storylines and a lack of drugs, cursing and violence. It is too bad the movie distributors keep forgetting this fact and keep bringing out the violent shock schlock. Even in 2014 this movie is welcome and apprciated by those who discover it. Well worth your time and money - (you'd have spent more going to the theater - and here you can cry in your own home !!) -- enjoy",1404691200,5,1020,4.317708333333333

5669759,5,B00BRKYZVM,I bought this movie recently at a christian bookstore in north carolina. It has been on the shelf for several months and today with it being a wintery snowy kind of day I took it down and decided to watch it. This movie pierced my heart.for its story line and it is now one of my favorite christian movies. I actually thought the young man portraying the main character was developmentally challenged until I started reading about the actors. What a tremendous acting job Ian did as Jimmy. It will cause you to reflect on your walk with Christ...it will be a good conversation starter if you have people over to watch it...it is great for almost all ages although children under 6 or 7 might not understand it. I was especially moved by the Watchers in the story line and how God had those special angel beings looking after this young 14 year old boy throughout the storyline. Did I week while watching it? Yes. But I was also rejoicing too over the fact it is a movie that Hollywood or other people need to take note that this is the kind of movie we want for our families. No cursing. No sex. No drugs although there was a slight mention in it concerning two teens who were drug into the possibility of selling drugs by the character who was bad in the movie but not for long was this used. I love movies that cause me to be happy while watching a story and not so downcast by the negatives that Hollywood keeps making. I love a story that could be true and I love a movie that you do not have to be afraid who watches it because of its content. There were a few negative comments here but I did not understand them. The whole story was beautiful and I will watch it again and again and look for others like it that I do not have to be embarrassed while watching a movie with even my grandkids. I will not watch the filth that is out there anymore and when I find christian movies on line or in christian bookstores I usually buy them to have on hand for company. Oh watch it and be blessed by this movie Jimmy with a beautiful story of how a 14 year old boy loves the Lord Jesus in his simplicity of life and how it can speak to anyone who needs touched in this way.,1392422400,6,2170,4.19377990430622
5669760,5,B00BRKYZVM,"Many times, Christian movies just aren't very well done. But this had a great story, the acting was good and it had a great message.

5669764,2,B00BRKYZVM,"I checked this out from our local library, because it is a Dove Family Approved movie.  I will say, it is refreshing, encouraging and wonderful that this movie is biblically based...well done!  But that is where the Family Approved ends in my book.  From the opening scene, the dramatic action, is too much for me.  I would not allow kids to watch this until at least H.S., but personally, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, sadly.  I know I am ""sensitive"" and it didn't bother my husband as much, but he was even surprised that this was Family Approved (probably only because it is clean, moral and good message overall).  There are many things I did not like, but I'll just point out the main thing - Jimmy is put through too much mental as well as physical torment, that it is a very uncomfortable watch.

8573143,4,B00BRKYZVM,"Five stars for Ian Colletti; one for the movie itself. His portrayal of a mentally challenged teenage boy is outstanding. If it were not for this talented young actor, I would have quit watching this movie within the first ten minutes.  But I found Colletti's performance striking, and his character portrayal believable. Because of him, I found myself watching this film until the end. The other actors are mediocre, the plot is predictable, even the score is bland. Script has heavy emphasis on a religious/Christian theme. Movie is a real snoozer.",1520726400,,550,5.043956043956044
8573144,1,B00BRKYZVM,"Okay story, but really unbelievable. Christian fantasy, which may be fine if you subscribe to this belief system, but annoying in its assumption that only Christians have value systems worth surbscribing to, especially since so many people with this belief system also believe in racism, lying, cheating, ect. and other activites that are the antithesis of Christianity as presented by Jesus. Please say up front when the movie is basically used as a vehicle attempting to proselytize. I also felt that the main character inaccurately portrays the capabilities of someone who is brain damaged. The synopsis has little to do with the actual content.",1520294400,,648,5.240384615384615
8573145,5,B00BRKYZVM,"This was such a heart-warming movie, a refreshing change of pace from the challenges we face today in our nation. Jimmy is an example of what I would strive to be--honest and from-the-heart. I really enjoyed this, and think that you will too.",1520121600,,242,4.651162790697675
