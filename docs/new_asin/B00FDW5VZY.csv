8614571,1,B00FDW5VZY,"I ordered this DVD twice, but both times, I got a DVD with the movie ""Sweet Baby Love"" recorded on the DVD. The first time I returned the DVD and Amazon sent a replacement DVD that also had the ""Sweet Baby Love"" on it. Both times, the DVD and the DVD cover art has the correct ""Mountains and Bodyscapes featuring Elena Cali Laci and Petra - a Nude-Art Film"" but the DVD has the ""Sweet Baby Love"" as the video recorded on it. This is a DVD written on demand video. Both DVD came in sealed packages, so something must be going work when the DVD is being produced.",1382572800,,561,4.155963302752293
