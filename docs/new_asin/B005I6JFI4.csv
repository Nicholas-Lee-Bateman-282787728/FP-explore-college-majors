8474317,1,B005I6JFI4,This is just another DVD that did not work. It seems that the discs are very cheaply made. This is unfortunate because of the historical value. The other thing that bothered me was that a lot of the pictures that are shown are croped going through the heads. In my opinion this is a great idea gone bad.,1393632000,,303,4.241379310344827
