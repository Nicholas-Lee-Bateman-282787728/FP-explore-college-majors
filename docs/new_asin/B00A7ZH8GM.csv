5395946,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"This is a bad film in almost every respect. I would guess it got made, as with a couple other recent films, based on the moderate success of ""the expendables"". Its pure cynical explotation. Its only 97 minutes long and mostly just a bunch of bits from the earlier films mixed up and reassembled. I get the impression that nobody associated with the film even tried. From lazy camera work, to badly acted scenes, to bad music, to a script full of unfunny attempts at humor and badly planned action scenes....the film has it all.

Most of the key people are ""B"" movie types. Many of them seem to have either A-Team or Max Payne on their resumes which would not usually seem to be a recommendation.

The director really likes ""shaky cam"" shots from handheld cameras. I've never thought that those effects worked in action films and they don't seem to work here. They make a really big deal out of a silly, impractical weapon through most of the film. The villians are all evil Russians seemingly leftover from a 1990s film. They didn't even bother hiring good actors for the villians. Bruce Willis plays the character almost as a parody of itself. Its all just a lazy mess. Its a very bad action movie.

----
Afterword:

A couple notes on the history of the film based on things I heard and read after the review. This film was originally going to be a die hard/""24"" crossover. The character that became the son in the final version was supposed to be Jack Bauer. Watching the film, that makes lots of sense to me in terms of the story. The film is a case study of why its bad to recycle scripts. There were also two directors on the project. The original director was Noam Murrow whose only credits were one indy romantic comedy and lots of TV commericals. But he left the film when he was offered the 300 sequel to direct. So in some sense, the film was a project that went on when it probably should have been stopped pre-production.

The original idea of the crossover suggests that the reason the script doesn't quite feel like ""die hard"" is that it wasn't supposed to be ""die hard"". It was a platform to use the fame of die hard to launch a potential series of ""24"" films.

With this in mind, the team on the film deserves credit for salvaging the project and turning out something while not great, was not a total joke or a disaster. Its still a bad action flim, but in my opinion the fault is with whoever decided to keep most of the old script after the ""24"" crossover idea was dropped.",1360886400,8,2492,4.4183006535947715
5395947,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"I love the Die Hard franchise. I liked this one, but this is one of the weakest in the series, along with Die Hard 2. The movie was too short and felt rushed. Bruce Willis's John McClane character didn't seem like the main star this time. It felt more like Jack's story, but John was just there to help him out, and to try to make this feel like a Die Hard movie. His classic infamous 'Yipee Ki-Yay' scene wasn't done too well. There were some funny one-liners and decent action scenes.

Jack McClane is a CIA agent in an undercover operation in Russia. When John hears that he's in trouble, he travels to Russia to help him out. Jack's mission is to protect a political prisoner named Yuri Komarov from Alik and his henchmen. The McClanes must stop them from stealing billions of dollars worth of weapons-grade uranium in Chernobyl. This isn't a horrible movie. I'll be adding it to my Die Hard collection, but it feels very different and unlike the originals. If you're a fan, you might like A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD!!!

P.S. Happy Valentine's Day",1360800000,,1047,4.476439790575916
5395948,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"If you don't like ""Die Hard,"" then you may want to get yourself checked out. The original film from 1988 is held in extremely high regard even to this day. It's often labeled as one of the greatest action films of all time and some even consider it to be their favorite Christmas themed film, as well. ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" are entertaining sequels while ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was okay; not great and hardly worth the 12 year wait between films, but passable. Something really terrible happened with ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" though. Maybe it's because director John Moore is saying that it was Bruce Willis who came up with the idea of John McClane being reunited with his son, but ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" feels like the one movie Nicolas Cage rejected in the past millennium that Bruce Willis decided to scoop up. That's an enormous feat considering this is the fifth film in an ongoing franchise.

Get ready for a big, heaping portion of thick and extremely stiff acting from both Sebastian Koch and Radivoje Bukvic. Are you trying to portray Russians who can't act? If so, you're doing a good job. Bad acting and stiff dialogue rear their ugly head in the opening scene and just douse the movie in their thick juices repeatedly until it ends. The score sounds like this generic rip-off blend of Thomas Newman's ""Skyfall"" soundtrack and Hans Zimmer's and James Newton Howard's ""The Dark Knight"" soundtrack. If none of that gets to you, then the lousy camera work will. There is this lengthy car chase that is completely held back by disoriented cinematography and reprehensible dialogue (more on that later). Everything is so blurry and shaky. Meanwhile what you can make out is so sloppy, shots aren't steady, and the camera seems to zoom-in suddenly for no reason at all and is jiggled around like someone is holding a camcorder while drunk and trying to balance on a trampoline.

Bruce Willis turns 58 this year. While middle age usually means slowing down for possible retirement or at least investing in some chewy vitamins or laxatives, it apparently means that John McClane has become indestructible. In this film alone he flips a truck and then gets up and runs away without a scratch, rolls two cars, jumps out of a building twice, and is thrown through a window by a helicopter. There's also the ridiculous amount of one-liners you have to put up with that are just so corny and feel so forced that you almost forget about that weird gun-knife thing John's son Jack (Jai Courtney) has on him for half the movie that always has to be pointed out for some reason. We get it; it's a knife that shoots bullets.

Golden examples of John's lame dialogue includes yelling ""Guess who?"" at a truck, calling Komarov (Koch) ""Papa Gepetto,"" the McClanes offering each other hugs and then bringing up that they're not a hugging family, John asking Jack ""You're not gonna cry again, are you?"" before giving him a hard time about it for five minutes, jumping and falling out of a building and then asking if Jack wants to go again, and John saying he deserves the father of the year award. The phrases, ""Shut up!"" and ""I'm on vacation!"" are also only said about a dozen times each. It's the gift that keeps on giving.

In between all of these daddy issues between Jack and John, Komarov is in possession of a file that could assist in incriminating corrupt Russian official Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov). An all out war breaks out between the CIA, which Jack works for, and the men who work under Chagarin and his lackey Alik (Radivoje Bukvic). A good portion of the film is devoted to Jack trying to get Komarov to a safe place with John in tow. Jack keeps talking about how John screwed him and continuously brings up how there's no time for this or that, but then makes time to stand around and listen to daddy's emotional breakdown. Alik decides to do his best Bugs Bunny impression in front of his hostages before doing a little jig and pointing out that he could have been a dancer. The sad thing is that bullet piercing your brain would hurt a lot less than witnessing him dance or try to act again, but it does make you wonder why they didn't try to squeeze in Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" during the end credits.

Without giving away too much, someone is shot in the head and then the gunman shoots this same individual five times in the chest. The body lingers around and is shown on camera for the next few scenes. Once you see the body lying on the ground, you see that this individual was wearing a bullet proof vest and where the bullets hit completely rendering those extra shots pointless. Maybe it was a new gun that was just being tested out or maybe it's some unusual Russian custom. The real culprit probably lies within the writer trying to write this movie blindfolded with a potato bag over his head while being hogtied, skewered, and slowly rotated over a roaring campfire like some sort of weird hillbilly approved rotisserie.

There's one scene in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" where John and Jack jump out of a building and fall through its layers in slow motion. It lasts maybe 60 seconds and is the only enjoyable aspect of what is otherwise a waste of 97 minutes. Its cinematography is a mess, the acting is painful, the dialogue seems like it will cause permanent brain damage if exposed to it for too long (kind of like the radiation in Chernobyl), and the entire story gives you fatigue as soon as it starts because it's been done so many times. Those laxatives are sounding pretty good right about now, aren't they John?",1360800000,9,5569,4.56956956956957
5395949,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Yippee-ki-yay! (If you know the rest, you may be part of the audience for whom this R-rated action-packed demolition derby was made...smile...)

He's baaaack.... John McClane is our favorite Energizer Bunny. Bruce Willis's dependable ""Die Hard"" action franchise (1988, 1990, 1995, 2007) continues to print money, so why not? I'm sure the DVD will sell for Amazon, too.

This time Mr. McC. is off to Russia because his grown son seems to be off the grid, and his daughter asks him to find him and bring him home. This prompts an unending series of vehicular smashes, gunfire, rocket fire, helicopter crashes, fist fights, suicidal leaps off roofs and down fire escapes, plus other violent action that I have forgotten. I have NEVER seen so many thugs shot, vehicles smashed and interiors destroyed.

We see:
  * Bruce Willis (""Looper"") is John, he tries in vain to speak Russian but the cabbie just laughs at him and treats him to a Frank Sinatra song.
  * Jai Courtney (""Jack Reacher"") is Jack, who seems to be in a tight spot, but does NOT want Dad to get involved.
  * Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Live Free or Die Hard"") is Lucy, she doesn't know who she should worry most about, her dad or her brother.
  * Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") is Komorov, a former gangster worth the price of your ticket.
  * Yuliya Snigir (""Kokoko"") is Irina, the gangster's resourceful (and beautiful) daughter.

5396018,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Ironically, although this was the first movie to be intentionally written as a DH flick, it is the least DH of them all. Here are my problems with the movie, both small and large.

BIG PROBLEMS

-John went to his son's trial and was somewhat prepared. This movie barely uses the wrong place, wrong time theme. The first two are Christmas vacations that go wrong, 3rd is him having to reluctantly work while suspended, 4th he is about to go home after a long day and has to do one last pick-up. In the 5th film, he specifically takes time off to go see his son's trial and suspects that something may go wrong. He is at the right place at the right time in this movie.

-He is a side kick in his son's adventure. Right from the start we jump into a situation that his son started and is in the middle of. Unlike the other films, if John had not been at the trial, nothing much would have changed. John helps fight and inspires his son to trudge on in the 3rd act, but aside from that everything would have gone basically the same. In the first 4 films he is a key figure to the development of the plot, in this one he is Sam Jackson and Justin Long, and even they served more of a purpose.

-John is still sparkling clean at the end. For me, one of the most iconic things about DH is seeing John get slowly more and more beat up and bloody, to the point where he is barely moving at the end. This not only reflects his character, but reflects reality as well (even if the jet chase doesn't). In this movie, he not only sustains some of the most brutal injuries, but he has almost no blood or bruise makeup through the whole thing! But guess what? His son does... Maybe Bruce wanted to look good till the end? I don't know but it drives me frickin' nuts.

-John is having way too much fun, and not in the right way. He is usually the reluctant hero who does what is right but wants it to end as soon as possible. Joking along the way just to get by. He is like a teenager playing a video game in this movie. He doesn't seem truly concerned about the danger, is overly cocky and casual. He very much has the pigheaded ""I am American and I can do whatever I want to in your dumb country"" attitude. He annoyingly screams ""I'm on vacation"" a million times in anger, but something tells me that there is nothing else he would rather be doing than shooting Russians with his son. It is much less honorable and more psychotic. Maybe John has finally cracked and is having PTSD like symptoms? If they take the next movie in this direction I can forgive it, but for now it is an inconsistent characterization, and one that makes him unlikable.

NITPICKS

-Too short. All other DH are a little over two hours, this one barely has an hour and a half's worth of material.

-1.85 aspect ratio. All other DH movies are 2.35. I personally like consistency of aspect ratios in franchises. I understand this is because of IMAX, but still, it's yet another thing that is different from the others.

-Cheesy slow-mo happy ending. Luckily they took this out of the ""extended"" cut, but the original ending where they get off the plane is vomit inducing. All other DH movies end overlooking the final carnage and destruction. Thankfully the director realized this, even if it was too late.

-Lucky's characterization. They sanitized her from the plucky bad-ass daughter of John McClane to a woman who does nothing but wait for the boys to get back home while she sits quietly. Many are confused as to why Lucy was later cut from the film, but I wholeheartedly support it. This way Lucy is still the same headstrong person we grew to love. Plus that stupid scene where John talks to her on the phone during a car chase to say that he can't talk right now is gone.

-The inclusion of an overly sexualized woman. The daughter of the one guy they rescue is the first female DH character who's main purpose is to be eye candy. Yes she has purpose for the plot, but clearly her looks are why they cast her/wrote her in. This is not only a tired cliche but broke a longstanding streak of well written female side characters in the franchise.

Just to be positive...

SOME THINGS I LIKED

-The cinematography (aside from the ratio) and the use of film with a hard grain. I honestly think it is one of the best looking DH films, even if it is the worst.

-That car chase. No CGI, great camera work and when you have seen a lot of dash cam videos, it makes this much more plausible than your average car chase. Basically the only reason to watch this movie.

-It takes place over one day, one of the few aspects of a DH movie they stuck to.

-The title. I am glad they kept on with the DH puns instead of calling it something like ""Son of John McClane"", ""The McClanes"" or ""McClane and Son"". Now that the title for the next movie ""John McClane"" has been revealed, I respect this movie for at least not doing a desperate title change.",1486512000,,4898,4.300760043431053

5396075,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"A Good Day to Die Hard
 A couple of years ago someone wanted to know who would step into the shoes of action hero actors Sly Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger now that they are getting to a certain age.  The answer for a while was Sly, Bruce and Arnold.  After Sly and Arnold have starred in major bombs already this year, it is up to Bruce Willis and A Good Day to Die Hard to save the day.  The film may not be up to the task.  The charm of the Die Hard franchise is the personality of John McClane, the tough, wise cracking character that Willis plays.  It this last episode of the franchise we get a lot less of our hero and a lot more fantastic destruction, lavishly applied.
 The screen time that Willis gets is well used.  He unites with his son in Moscow.  The estranged father and son have a chance to work through their issues while fighting bad guys and blowing stuff up.  The father-son slant gives Willis a small chance to actually act in between the action shots.  His son is played by 27 year old Australian actor Jai Courtney.  Courtney may be able to act but in this one he is only asked to be buff and move around while shooting, which is plenty for some of us.  But this version of Die Hard is not nearly as interesting as a movie as the first one.  It is loud however and has the virtue of having the largest helicopter in the world wrecked for you entertainment.
 To save money there isn't a girl in the movie at all or much of a script.  My movie buddy said This plot has more holes than my garden fence. Skip Woods, who also scripted the entertaining X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the very engaging Swordfish gives us a script that serves mostly as a way to paste together elaborate action sequences.  Thats fine as far as it goes but I think it is a dis-service to the franchise.  We expect more story in a Die Hard film. We don't expect a more expensive, more polished version of such films as The Expendables II but that is exactly what we got.  The producers (including Willis himself) spent $92 million to make this action packed splosion fest and will sweat to get their money back.  It brought in only $26 million in the 3 day opening weekend.  We will see if it has legs.  Films like this often make up the domestic shortages in places like Bombay where audiences do not appreciate fine shades of texture.
 Director John Moore also over saw Max Payne, a less than stellar hit at the box office.  This one hour 37 minute R rated action mega movie might very well finish off the Die hard line and Willis long career as an action hero with it.  A subpar two and a half saw blades for this big budget disappointment.",1469836800,,2657,4.28714859437751
5396076,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"If you have followed Bruce Willis throughout the ""Die Hard"" series of movies, it's action packed from start to finish.

5396128,5,B00A7ZH8GM,Good if you are in the mood for a shoot 'em up and blow 'em up kind of movie.  I am a Bruce Willis fan... and I also like having background noise when I'm cleaning or whatever; this movie is great for that.,1452643200,,206,3.7906976744186047

5396130,2,B00A7ZH8GM,This movie lost me at the beginning with John McLain standing in front of a van yelling at his son and blowing his cover when he could have made a clean escape...then acts stupid and old throughout. Frequently whining about being on vacation and arguing with his son. This character used to be much better solo; his son only highlights his age and the writers have scripted him to be weak and in the early stages of dementia. Wasted money on this one.,1451779200,,451,4.445783132530121

5396133,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"The movie is what it is.  Not exactly the best in the Die Hard Series and a fairly shallow plot with little character development.  But it's not a bad way to watch explosions, crashes and other forms of violence.

On a side note:  I purchased the Amazon digital copy.  Amazon has this annoying habit of changing what you purchased to something slightly different.  The first 4 times I watched the movie it had the standard appearances by Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy.  The ""new"" version it has currently reverted to has some alternate scenes inserted and all references to Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character have been removed (although she is still listed in the credits)  Personally I think the movie is better without her BUT...  I don't like what i paid for being switched out for something else at Amazon's whim.",1450569600,,820,4.8

It was a lot better than Die Hard 4: Comic Con or whatever it's called! The story does not get too deep and does not drag. This movie knows that we know who everyone is and just takes off without looking back. It's humorous enough but not often. Nobody gets naked or does something gross. Thankfully. The action is wild, but 90% of it is believable. A lot people get shot AND stay dead once shot. One death in particular was way over the top, but hey. I think a lot of people gave this movie a bad rating because everyone wants a ton of fan service--go watch DH4 again, if so. This movie, alone, is a 4 star action flick. It might not be a summer blockbuster but close enough; and, it's well worth renting. It's a shame that the reviews convinced me not to see until now.",1443398400,,887,4.192982456140351

Yeah, so my disc told me that I needed to update the software of my Blu-Ray player in order to play this movie. Of course, my player is a few years old, that version is no longer made and they don't have any firmware to download! So I have a coaster!  Which pretty much SUCKS!!!

When the main villains died I was like wow, it's going to be a real twist on this one, but it turned out to be the end.  I thought they were still building up and going somewhere.  It was like, who is the bad guy now?  Oh, credits... lame.  I did like the plot twists, they seem to have done all they could to prevent you from guessing what was going to happen based on the other ones.  I do wish there was another forty minutes though... the third one was a solid forty minutes longer and was really surprising.  Like the other reviews said, it didn't make sense that John was wandering around acting lost, he should have just gone with his son instead of yelling on the streets.  Maybe he thought his son was breaking out of jail... but isn't that why he came?  The wit is terrible, yes, they tried too hard and did not succeed.  I think they were trying to be cute with the vacation things but it really didn't make sense, maybe they did change the plot-line before the movie came out.  I suggest they fix the terrible lines and add another forty minutes of plot to the end, what they were after should have gotten away and really been part of something even bigger.",1433548800,2,1301,4.261224489795918

5396262,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Now, really.  You decided that the fifth entry in the Die Hard franchise should come out on Valentine's Day?  I've heard of counter programming, but this is a bit ridiculous.  Of course, it did give my roommate and I something to do.  And I found A Good Day to Die Hard to be a fun addition.

John McClane (Bruce Willis) is worried about his son Jack (Jai Courtney).  That's especially true when he finds out that Jack is in prison on a long string of charges - in Russia.  So he heads over there, arriving on the day Jack is brought into court.

But Jack is actually in prison and in court to help break Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) out of jail.  Yuri is a political prisoner, and Jack is working with the CIA.  His father suddenly showing up on the scene turns his mission into chaos.  But as things spiral further out of control, will the two be able to work together to save the day?

So let's start with the bad.  First, there's shaky camera work.  It feels like it belongs in a Bourne movie and at times makes it hard to follow the action.  I really hate that style, so that was a turn off to me from the start.

Secondly, the fact that John is estranged from yet another family member.  Not only has the plot been done to death, but there is so little time for it here that it feels underdeveloped.

Finally, maybe it's just me, but some of the dialogue felt looped and added much later.  It put me out of the film a little bit.  This happened in several of the quieter scenes.

Outside of those scenes, the acting was good.  Okay, so depth of character and acting isn't really required here, but I bought the performances no matter whether the characters were fighting for their lives or trying to figure out their next move.

Really, these films are about the action, and here the film delivers.  Yes, it's over the top, so not all of it is believable.  But it is fun.  I was sitting there glued to the screen during all the scenes trying to see how they'd come out of it alive, much less in one piece.

And the story holds together fairly well.  I don't want to say too much about it, but like the rest of the film, it makes sense and does a good job of connecting the action sequences.

This film earns its R rating from the language and violence.  There's plenty of both.  And yes, that includes the famous catch phrase of the series.

Throughou, McClane and son exchange barbs as they cooperate in escaping from, then turning the tables on the bad guys.

So much time had elapsed between the last Die Hard film and this one, I was certain it couldn't be pulled off but would be a flop. I'm glad to say I was wrong.  It's as good as any of the others, even with a little age on the star.  Gettingolder hasn't done anything to the character of John McClane except make him better.",1428105600,,800,4.355704697986577
5396272,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"A Good Day to Die Hard(Jan/13) stars,among others,Bruce Willis,Jai Courtney, and Sebastian Koch. This film will stand as the benchmark for how low a franchise film can go. It's total lack of credibility,believability and over all sensibility, leaves ones mind boggled to the max.
The story finds papa bear John McLane going to Moscow to visit his estranged son that he hasn't seen in years. It seems his son is in a bit of  a pickle with the authorities over there. He has assassinated a Russian gangster and sits behind bars awaiting trial. In exchange for a light sentence he agrees to cooperate with a corrupt Russian politician. A Russian billionaire is also on trial, and he will say HE is the one who gave the order to kill his target. The politician wants a ""file"" the billionaire has,but which he will not relinquish.
Willis arrives just in time to see his son being transported into the court building. Soon after the trail starts a row of cars outside,filled with explosives,detonates,shattering the court room. Immediately John jr.is escorting the Russian billionaire away from the area. He grabs a truck and is bombing along until Willis stops it. This pause enables other gangsters,the ones who set the explosives and are after the billionaire also,to catch up. A wild chase ensues throughout Moscow and Willis decides to steal a large truck and follow his son,helping him with the bad guys in pursuit.
After a lengthy chase and a LOT of crashes,Willis and his son manage to get their prisoner to safety...in a  safe house,run by the CIA.Yes,Willis' son is a CIA operative sent to rescue the billionaire. The ""safe""house is set upon by those after them and the trio have to flee for their lives. The billionaire arranges to meet his daughter later but it is a set up. The daughter it seems is working independently of her father and she too wants the file for her own purposes. She gets what she came for and takes her father with her,while she orders her henchmen to kill Willis and his boy. Of course we know that cannot go down as planned and the two end up out of a tight situation.
The two follow their noses and drive to a building at Pripyat(sound familiar?It's the town just outside the Chernobyl nuclear plant).The gangsters have already arrived ahead of them and have discovered a vault full of weapons grade uranium. There never was a file. The billionaire's daughter again pulls an about face and kills her head henchman. It seems it was all a ruse to get her father out safely. As they begin to extract the booty Willis and son arrive on the scene and begin to wreak havoc on them. They manage to get alone with the billionaire who feigns sickness. Of course the two don't know what has happened between daughter and father, but they soon become suspicious. Then they are fighting for their lives in no time. Between all the foes that confront them and a huge menacing helicopter,the two have their work cut out for them. But was the end ever in doubt? The billionaire is killed while Willis rescues his son and the helicopter comes crashing down with the daughter inside. The film ends as Willis and his boy fly back to NYC,courtesy of the the CIA,and reunite with Willis' daughter.
Firstly,from the moment Willis grabs a truck to follow his son throughout Moscow(was that a Pittsburgh sign I saw on the freeway?),the movie's believability goes right down the tubes. There is no build up to make us think that what he is doing is anywhere near reality and probable. He is not in NYC ,but in Moscow. And the longer the movie goes on(from this point there's about 85 minutes worth!) the worse and less credible his actions become.
Secondly, the main thrust of this picture,unlike all the others in this successful franchise,have been Willis-centric. We follow him,we root for him and his actions are ""logical""(for John McLane) and follow the prescribed formula. This story is completely different. The story here centers mainly around his son's activities and problems. This film puts Willis' character in a secondary role,a tag along part. What in the world would ever make the writers,the director,et al,of this film think for one minute think that the folks out there in the vast wasteland( who have supported this series all along) would go for such a premise?
Lastly, the final set of the vault building. It was much more evident in the theatres but still it is there none the less on DVD.It looked totally phony/fake from the outset. You cannot suspend your disbelief for one second because you KNOW you are looking at a set piece. The helicopter is a miniature,as is the building and it just becomes another weak link in a sad looking chain. The nail in the proverbial coffin,if you will.
Needless to say,but I will anyways,this whole Willis papa bear reconciling with his son thingy,and the resulting interaction between father and son throughout the film, turns into a bowl of sour milk VERY quickly. It's DOA,as is the film itself.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary and deleted scenes.
All in all the biggest turkey of the franchise and a big clucker of a picture on its own. There just isn't enough believability in this film to last a bathroom break, let alone a full 98 minutes. Mr. Willis,I believe,should be more careful in the future when he signs on to do another in this franchise(if there ever is another one after this debacle);not just putting his John Henry on the line for the big bucks involved. That is assuming he even CARES about it in any way,shape or form.",1428019200,,5593,4.723643807574207

This fifth...no sixth movie? I don't know. I don't care. This movie was just a really bad thrill ride. It lacked the panache and inventiveness as the first movie had. The script to this film presents you with a very tired looking John McClane who thinks he is still the badass underdog in Russia and even seems tired in the movie. The action is even tiring to watch since it does nothing new but repeat typical things that's been done before.

This would have made a great father-son movie in an entirely different script without having to rely on the success of the first movie over shadowing it.",1424304000,,652,4.425
5396321,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"After the daughter endangered in the previous and fourth installment of Die Hard, now in the fifth installment we get the son, John McLane Jr., who is the partner of his own father as a CIA agent in Moscow. We had to fall, sooner or later, in the anti-Russian cold war atmosphere. I am afraid though Bourne and Taken do that type of action film a little bit better. Here it is too gross, too thick, too much deconstruction and not enough subtlety.

The two McLanes find themselves on the same mission but from two different agencies, one CIA and the other NYPD, or is it FBI? They have to recuperate a political prisoner who is going to be tried in Moscow for some unclear reason. We all know Russia is a dictatorship. That type of clich is slightly too schematic to be believable. But it is a lot worse than that. The two American agencies were completely fooled if not bamboozled. The political prisoner is a personal friend of the president of Russia, follow my eyes and read my lips. But he is using both the Americans and the Russian security services to have the president assassinated and to take over.

His daughter is the main in-between triple agent and she succeeds perfectly well. The two McLanes are just following the trend and get completely ridiculed and nearly killed. But they manage to get to the secret abandoned nuclear facility, probably Chernobyl which is not in Russia but in Ukraine, but who cares about the place and name. From Moscow to that place anyway it takes about thirty seconds on the screen, in real time about a couple of hours. Distances are not exactly correct.

There they find the dear father who is pretending to be very sick though he has killed with his daughter quite a few of the Russian secret agents. The supposed report hidden in this place does not exist and then the mission is reduced to killing the triple agents, destroying a helicopter, etc. They do this is in a jiffy and they survive all the mayhem with hardly a scratch. They get out of Russia with no problem whatsoever and they arrive in some American airport where the daughter McLane is waiting for them. We just wonder why they bothered to get involved in what was a purely Russian domestic political game. I guess American security agencies are no longer what they used to be.

Lets hope there will not be a sequel to that. We have reached the third underground level under well devised action films. Lets say they were part of the anti-Russian campaign for the Olympic Games. Viva la new era Cold War! I am sure Ron L. Hubbard must be turning in his tomb in total clarity.

John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help out his seemingly wayward son, Jack, only to discover that Jack is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist, causing the father and son to team up against underworld forces.

What did I think?

The opening seconds lift our spirits and hopes with a haunting bass version of Ode To Joy but then the black screen gives way to vision and its mostly downhill from there (impressive car chase aside).

Jack McClane is the Jar Jar of the Die Hard universe. Hes irritating, unnecessary and a walking cliche.

The third and fourth in the series were daft, harmless, entertaining romps but this, McClanes hopefully final escapade, is a bit of a stinker to say the least.

Despite the half-hearted efforts of the esteemed Mr. Willis, there was no way he could defeat the evil triumvirate of terrible scripting, laughable plotting and sloppy direction. Trying to make a Die Hard into a buddy movie was yet another mistake as was the dullest, longest, most pointless car chase in movie history. Ah, yes to the plot. CIA deep-cover agent tries to get close to corrupt Russian politician in oligarchs employ trying to steal nuclear material. Or something like that. It makes no sense at all, lots of stuff blows up, people get shot, stuff crashes and the English subtitles for the Russian dialogue aren't on screen long enough to be read. Not that it really matters, you're so busy drowning in a pool of drivel with your brains dribbling out of your ears that no amount of corny, trite dialogue could haul you to safety.

The 4th Die Hard wasn't anything special which basically gave me no motivation to run out and see this movie.  Finally purchased a Blu-Ray digital copy for $4.  I cannot believe how horrible this movie is.  There was a few special effects that looked decent and also some that looked terrible.  I probably made it through about 30 minutes until I walked away from the TV and I just have no reason to finish it.  Normally I don't get into writing reviews for movies, but this thing was so bad I just had to.  I cannot even bring myself to give this 2 stars.

It has a truly frenetic pace and the action seems non-stop to the point that it never takes a breath long enough for the plot to catch up with the on-screen heroics and mayhem. Yet, it all seems to work and Bruce Willis just seems to keep getting better with age in this role. I really find the negative reaction to this film perplexing.

5396464,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Over the years I have seen numerous Bruce Willis movies, including all of his Die Hard series (playing John McClane, Ex-New York cop) with the exception of this one. I did not see this one at the theater (A good Day to Die Hard) but when I saw it at a bargain price I immediately purchased it. It did not receive great ratings when it first came out, but I enjoyed watching this DVD.  I felt it has some good chase and action scenes.  It is also what I expected from a Bruce Willis Die Hard movie.

This one has John McClane in Russia searching for his son (played by Jai Courtney) who has been imprisoned in Moscow. There is plenty of action as father and son join forces to combat the evil forces in the world.

 If you like the Bruce Willis Die Hard movie series you may want to check this one out.  You can pick this up for a very reasonable price.

5396479,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"... and one actually touching moment in the movie (can you believe it?), where John Sr. and Jr. patch things up in McClane kinda way.  Other than that, the action sequences are prolific and the highway chase is really quite quite good.  Lots of mayhem and crunching.  Plot twists are pretty predictable, but I don't think anyone's trying to watch the movie to think too hard about what's going to happen next.  We know the odds are stacked way above their heads, and we know that the McClane's will steamroll right through them.

Just action, lots of crunched up cars, even a helicopter or two...",1414022400,,596,4.6380952380952385

5396486,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"Let me start this by saying it certainly could have been a better film, but I still liked it a lot anyway! The action may have been a lot more over the top compared to the last Die Hard movies, making it a bit different, but it still had an okay story and the father and son thing was played well enough I thought. In my opinion it still felt like it had some of that Die Hard blood in it, even though it had more of a spy theme to it (like Bourne) due to his son being in the CIA. The action was not only the best part, but was full of excitement and really heart-stopping moments. It was done really well. There are also little things that you might notice along the way, if you are paying enough attention, that I didn't notice until I had repeated watching it. It is more of an action film than the other films, but it helps freshen things up and does extremely well during the action. I can understand people not liking it, because while the other Die Hard films were focused more on telling a good story, this one is focused more on having good action. I forgave it for that, because I still thought it was a very solid effort. I loved it!",1412640000,,1145,4.093333333333334

the screenplay is very silly and ridiculous and the movie is filmed in Russia, very pathetic
John McClane is an American Hero/icon the story should still be set in the U.S.A
i think 20th century fox was trying too hard to keep the franchise going with this film
and cause they did, the plot and acting is very ridiculous it's an insult

the first 3 are the best of course, the 4th sequel is still Pretty Good
excellent written screenplay and Great Directing from Len wisemen so the 4th sequel probably just makes it
with the first 3 films
but this 5th sequel is pretty bad, wrong Decision for 20th century fox to give the Go ahead for this film
the screenplay is set in Russia, very silly and ridiculous
they were probably just desperate at the time to keep the franchise going for the fans
and didn't examine the screenplay properly
Bruce willis was under contract with 20th century fox regardless so he had to do the film anyway
and for that this 5th sequel turned out very pathetic

any Die Hard fan will have their own opinion of this 5th sequel, that's fine
so you either Like it or Hate it
for me the franchise ended at the 4th sequel LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD

this blu-ray release has both Theatrical and longer cut of the film
the Extended cut is just some extra mins of more action/violence really, just about 2mins of extra footage
there's lots of extras about 1 hour of behind the scenes making of footage
footage of them filming in russia etc

I don't like the film at all, it was hard for me to watch, no suspense , no excellent written storyline
as a big fan of the DIE HARD films this 5th sequel was insulting to me
i just gave it 1 star",1406160000,,1946,4.220430107526882

The so-called story line left me early in the movie when John showing up screwed up his sons
operation because somehow an RPV was going to miraculously do something to whisk away a
a Russian political prisoner.
Hey guys..........RPV's don't whisk anything away, I know, as I used to build them!
I won't go any farther into the movie, as once you realize this is nothing more than a set up

After that, I think a second peak was the film LIve Free or Die Hard, with Justin Long as Bruce Willis's unwilling side-kick.  That movie played off both the difference in ages and in attitudes [Willis representing a fairly ruthless patriotism and Long a more pacifist and anti-government young adult].  This time, the story places Willis in Moscow trying to stop the use of some super-weapon based on ""red plutonium"".  Of course, there is a basis in the real world for the plot, and this time, the main dramatic element seems to be between Willis's character and a son who is in Moscow working for the CIA.  Willis and his son, who have never really ""bonded"", dislike each other because they each see too much of themselves in each other....but I digress.  I digress from the mandatory explosions, gunfire and what-not.  Actually if you want to see a better recent action film with Bruce Willis, you should see Red 2, with Willis, Malkovich, Freeman and others.  Much more fun!",1404518400,,1052,4.673913043478261

I love this series so much that i was pretty excited when i heard they were making another one. The day before it came out i heard it got bad reviews which i could really care less about but i also heard it was only 90 minutes. Which really don't mean much either but still all the other Die Hard movies were well over 2 hrs. Kinda made me think they either rushed it or threw it together. Regardless i went to see it. For the first time i experienced being disappointed at a Die Hard movie. The complaint is way too short,not enough time to develop a proper story,and too much focus on his son. John Mcclane is the hero of these movies,I didn't even really know who the bad guy was he was not nearly as memorable as even Timothy Olyphant from Live Free or Jeremy Irons from With a Vengeance. Theres a lot of action in it but no good fight scenes really nothing to brag about. I don't hate it but its without a doubt the lowest entry of the series.
If i had to rate best to least fav it would be
1,2,3,4 then 5 in that order

5396672,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"This is not a Die Hard movie.  Oh, it says ""Die Hard"" in the title and there's a guy named John McClane in it, but this is most definitely not the John McClane that made Die Hard a successful franchise.

First off, this McClane is stupid.  I mean DUMB.  What made the other Die Hards a hit (especially the first three) was McClane's brain.  He was always one step ahead of the audience.  He could see something going on when we couldn't.  We had to catch up to him.  We like smart heroes.  We admire them.  We want to follow them because they know what they're doing and they can do it better than we ever could.

But in this ""Die Hard"", the audience is ahead of McClane--by a mile.  It takes him forever to realize that his son is a CIA agent.  And about that--his son joins the CIA and he doesn't know?  Even an estranged father would hear about this important news.  When McClane FINALLY learns the truth, he just laughs it off.  ""Spy s--t?  I thought you were dealing drugs!""  Smirk-laugh-smirk.  (Yeah.  In addition to being stupid, this John McClane is also an annoying a-hole.)  Why would he think so little of his own son?  Or of this significant accomplishment in his life?  No explanation is ever given.  That happens a lot in this movie.

Second, the plot--what we can understand of it--is totally ridiculous.  No spoilers, but it centers on a key that opens a vault.  Clearly, the bad guys have access to all kinds of weaponry and explosives,  and they have no problem blowing the borscht out of the rest of Russia looking for this key ...  But couldn't they spare a little explosives to just blow open the vault door?  Or just cut through the door?  Wouldn't that be a lot easier?  They could empty the vault quietly and no one would ever know.  But that would require logic though.

Third, the movie is just a mess.  It's like they had one movie, then ripped it apart and slapped it together again, hoping to turn it into something presentable.  There's evidence of this.  1) The opening scene with John Jr. in Russia feels like a different movie--in fact, if the filmmakers had just focused on that story, left Bruce Willis out, and not tried to shoehorn it into a ""Die Hard"", they could have had something.  2) The gun range scene with Bruce Willis and Amaury Nolasco (Prison Break) is clearly a reshoot.  Willis looks (and acts) completely differently here than he does in the rest of the story.  In fact I wish THIS was the John McClane that was in the movie.  This is a human McClane.  Quiet.  Thoughtful.  Maybe a bit worn out, but still ready to fight if he has to.  He's worried about his son.  We could relate to this McClane.  Not to the loudmouthed idiot McClane is in Die Hard 5, who apparently, is more indestructible than Wolverine.

There's so much more stupidity (you can't spray away radiation!), plot holes and tired clichs we could get into, but really, there's no point.  The movie is so  forgettable you won't remember any of it after it ends.",1404345600,2,2978,4.454376163873371

5396700,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Will this Die Hard franchise please just go away?  The original was, and is, a classic; each succeeding Die Hard film merely ratchets up the suspension of disbelief with outrageous stories, unbelievable villains, and protagonist John McClane becoming a virtual cartoon character as he overcomes impossible, death-defying predicaments.

Enter the latest burnt toast offering:  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.  Here we have Bruce Willis's McClane heading for Russia to supposedly go to the aid of his estranged son, Jack (a bored looking Jai Courtney), who is on Death Row.  But there's a twist:  Jack is actually an undercover CIA operative, and he's feverishly working to get a political prisoner (Sebastian Koch) out of the country--a prisoner who can finger the head of the Russian mob.  Predictably there are sudden twists and turns as to whom the actual villain is, and as this turkey limps to its Herculean over-the-top ending (here's a hint:  a bobtail truck taking down a military helicopter), John and Jack are put through the paces by director John Moore, who has them plunging out of windows and through scaffolding and into dumpsters and most-convenient pools of murky water.  We even have our heroes journey to Chernobyl and endure that stifling radioactive environment sans protective gear.  Obviously the McClanes are invincible to serious injury; but they are susceptible to making silly movies.

Bruce Willis looks old and tired, and has nada chemistry with Courtney.  The plot, the pacing, are lame pizza supreme, with a contrived, sappy ending thrown in allegedly to make us feel good.  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is a tedious, 98-minute mental exercise to force the viewer to conclude it is really a good day to end the Die Hard franchise.

Bruce Willis doesn't do anything by half measures but he does everything with sly glee in his eye and with that wily delivery of his.  It's a really fun show to watch because of him and this new situation he's in with his ne'er do well son arrested and facing the death penalty or life in a Russian Prison!!.  Cut em some slack guys.

Dad riding to the rescue and getting himself smack dab in the middle of a mess of international proportions not to mention having Dad spoil his son's big mission in Moscow is grist for the Die Hard mill and boy do they grind that grain down.  The opening action sequence alone is worth the price of admission with a car chase that has to be seen to be believed! The one liners firing back and forth between Dad and Junior are rapid fire entertainment at its best! The plot also cleverly mirrors their own angst with it's set up of Father and Daughter and makes the goings on even more pointed in the end.

You must be a Die Hard Movie Franchise Fan.
You must be a Bruce Willis Fan.
You must have a sense of humor.
You must accept the premise that the story line is meaningless and is simply there to support violence and more violence.
You must have reasonable expectations that John McClane Sr. and Jr. Should have died 57 times in this movie but it is OK that they didn't.
If you can accept the above terms and conditions you should watch this movie and you can expect to be reasonably entertained. The destruction of $11M in exotic automobiles is amazing and almost worth watching the movie just for that, and it leaves you wondering how they did that.

This movie does indeed make John McClane die hard and is like watching Alzheimer's disease destroy a beloved family member. It remembers some of it's old glory clearly and can still spout a few very tired and cliche lines, but the real soul is gone. This movie is not even worth watching. It just makes you a bit wistful, makes you long for the glory days of the past, and makes you sad as you watch a once vital and dynamic series crawl through the final time left to it.

I've never been a fan of ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"", but this film makes that one look a whole lot better.

This movie is a ""Die Hard"" film in name only.  Our ""always in the wrong place at the wrong time"" McClane hero mostly just stands around watching events unfold around him.  He's not outsmarting anyone or throwing a monkey wrench into anyone's plans.  He's just chasing after a bad guy he knows nothing about and stopping several times to have the same conversation with his estranged son over and over again.

I can't recommend this film to anyone.",1390780800,,820,4.5

5396808,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"The original Diehard was a shocking and imaginative action romp that virtually created the high tension never-say-die action hero role. Bruce Willis made a surprising transition from his light comedy fame in Moonlighting to everyone's favorite tough, wise-cracking off duty cop. It was a huge hit and is still popular today.

Sadly no movie in the series has matched the ingenuity or the heart of the original, and each has seemed a step down from the last. The plots have deteriorated to the point where this latest one is almost unintelligible. What does make it through is trite and uninvolving. The bad guy isn't a bad guy long enough to really learn to hate him. The bad guy that we did sort of hate isn't dealt with by the hero. The possible fun of a buddy movie involving McClane and his son can never bear fruit since all they do for most of the movie is spit childish and antagonizing venom at each other.

Worst of all, Willis simply looks old and tired in the role. For those of us introduced to him in Moonlighting, who thrilled to Die Hard, seeing the balding gray stubble and constantly pained expression only served to rip apart any effort at nostalgia and replace it with sadness for what has been lost ... both through years and translation.

In this plot the bad guys have an evil enough plan ... they want to recover long hidden nuclear material and sell it for millions. But this evil plot is never really sold to the viewer. Instead we get seemingly endless whining by the son about how McClane has ruined a long planned operation. Sorry writers, there is just no viewer investment in that whining. We get one long chase and gun battle scene after another ... none of which have any plausibility whatsoever. People fall dozens of feet with no further injury than cuts and getting dirty. Mere gunshot wounds are quickly forgotten. What they thought were stunning plot reversals are presented weakly with no drama and less forethought.

All I can say about this movie is that it was better than the ""Total Recall"" remake, and that isn't any recommendation whatsoever. LOL",1389744000,2,2090,4.671195652173913

5396812,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"A dreadfully tired mess of a terrible and banal action flick. When reviews first surfaced for the film I read one critic saying ""...even Bruce Willis looks bored"", this is truthfully the case. There is absolutely nothing in this film to keep you hooked, impassive acting, a weary old plot and more of the same. To boot there is more subtitles in this movie than a foreign film, which is generally not the best recipe for a successful action movie.",1389571200,,447,4.6
5396813,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"In 1988, we were first introduced to John McClane, and the ""Die Hard"" series. It was exhilarating and explosive, and McClane, as we would see in the next couple of sequels, was just a regular joe. Someone who was always at the wrong place at the wrong time. He was a blue collar guy who did what he could with what he had. He felt like he could possibly even be us. Sadly, that man is gone.

So, what is it about? I'm still not even sure. But really, at this point, does it even matter? It's all about the fun of seeing Bruce and the action. And there is action. There's no plot. John travels to Russia to help his son Jack, who is in a Russian prison, and before you know it, the two are protecting and traveling with a political prisoner with the usual bad guys hot on their heels.

Where to start? ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" was a much better movie, but it already started to show the signs that the franchise is not what it was. AGDTDH takes that and completely obliterates any sense of familiarity. If there hadn't been few mentions of ""McClane"", or Bruce uttering his famous line at the end, you wouldn't of known this was a 'Die Hard' movie. It was just a Bruce Willis shoot 'em up that could of been any other number of his movies. McClane has become an indestructible, supernatural creature who is no longer 'one of us'. Not only that, but he seems to care very little for human life, as you can see in the first big chase scene when he is driving over cars and smashing down the tops. He even said ""Sorry"" or something to one lady in a car, but is that good enough? There is a lot of action in the movie, and while some of it is good, most of it is way too over the top for a normal human being. Shoddy CGI in some scenes doesn't help either. In some movies, I may not care as much as this, but this just isn't 'Die Hard'.

Now, we come to McClane, Jr. Why was he needed? Why must filmmakers add a partner, or a kid, who is always annoying and more unlikable than the villain? Bruce does it just fine on his own. He doesn't need a sidekick. We don't need daddy issues amongst the action. It may of been okay if it were handled in another, different kind of 'Die Hard' movie, but it felt like padding here. As for Bruce, he may be getting older, but he still has it as an action star. He seemed a little lost in some scenes, but he has enough juice for a few more of these.

In the end, there were signs right from the beginning that this was going to be bad. The abbreviated running time was a sign. No big, important action film that is part of a big series is that short. John McClane has hair. Otherwise, it's just Bruce Willis. And, of course, there was the dumping of the movie in February. A month usually reserved for movies the studios just want to drop. ""Die Hard"" is a big summer movie. There were just things wrong from the start that you knew was going to spell bad things about the movie. This isn't John McClane. This isn't Die Hard. I don't know what this movie was. There is another one in the pipeline I hear. I hope they have learned from the mistakes of this movie and send the series out in style, as a valentine to the fans. But this movie? The party truly seems to be over.",1389484800,,3202,4.126602564102564
5396814,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"I really wasn't expecting much, especially after the last film, although I was hoping that it would at least be an entertaining, if silly action film. While it doesn't exactly fail on that score it's far from great. It's a shame because it actually starts quite well. The initial set up had promise, there's some Russian political skullduggery followed by John McClane finding out that his son is in trouble with the law in Moscow.

Things get going  pretty quickly and father and son encounter each other by chance at the start of a crazy chase across Moscow. They don't get on, which seems fair enough, the chase sequence is substantial, silly, but reasonably entertaining and it has an excellent truck.

Unfortunately things go down hill from that point, father and son discover that they both have a knack for killing people and that provides an instant bond and off they go. The plot gets sillier with each twist and comes to a conclusion in Chernobyl - although it manages to fail at using the inherent creepiness of the location.

As a Die Hard film it's pretty poor, it has Bruce WIllis against the bad guys, but it lacks a decent bad guy and more importantly it lacks the tension of him being alone against a superior force and the feeling that he's managing by the skin of his teeth to make an impact. Here he's just a gun wielding hero with no real sense of peril. On the bright side there's a few half decent wisecracks and of course the infamous line.

As an over the top action film it's not terrible, but there's better films out there to get your action fix, like the original Die Hard perhaps.",1389398400,,1610,4.537931034482758

5396895,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Let me just start by saying I don't hate the film. It was not a Die Hard movie but it was a fun, dumb watch. This review is about the actual Blu-ray itself.

I bought this version of the film because I had read in online articles that Director John Moore was forced by Fox to cut out many scenes from the film to get it under the 90 minutes that the studio wanted; I mean there was scenes in the trailer that were not even in the movie. Well long story short, I was incredibly disappointed with this cut of the film as it seemed nearly identical to the theatrical release with few changes (some arguably for the worse).
Some of the minor additions include a slightly extended scene of John target shooting (exciting stuff!) and a fairly comical scene of John and Jack going through different car trunks looking for guns and finding some dead bodies. The weird part about the trunk scene is that the deleted scenes of the Blu-Ray actually have the full extended scene of this were John and company are confronted by the cars owner and must fight a couple of thugs. It is not a great scene, but it was entertaining and I have no clue why it was not in the EXTENDED CUT of the film. Other than that the additions are almost not noticeable with a slightly longer car chase seen at the beginning and some other minor dialog changes.

In fact, the extended cut of the film is nearly the same length as the theatrical version; but how is this? Well this brings me to my biggest complaint about the Blu-ray, which is that they actually cut a couple of scenes from the film. The 'extended cut' of the film actually completely cuts all of the scenes featuring John's daughter, Lucy. Now look, its not that the scenes were very important to begin with, but I bought the extended cut to get all of the (unnecessary) scenes from the film and to have actually less scenes is ridiculous.

Other than that there is some other lack luster behind the scenes stuff and a hand full of deleted scenes, a few of which were pretty funny and should have been put in the extended edition cut!

I can only assume that they plan to milk me for more money when they release the ultra-unrated-directors cut 5 disc blu-ray box set of all the films just to have a sixth movie come out a year later like what usually happens.

The extended cut was not for the purchase on an already lack luster Die Hard film. Let's hold our breath for 6 and maybe a real directors cut.",1386979200,,2437,4.3355263157894735

Even though this movie was not as good as the previous ""Die Hard"" movies, it was fun to see Bruce Willis back in the character of ""McClane"" that we like and Jai Courtney made a new action hero actor to look out for.

Yes, if they made a sixth ""Die Hard"" movie, I would be interested. Bruce Willis still has the testosterone.

5396939,4,B00A7ZH8GM,Automobiles and trucks careen.  Metal crunches.  Glass shatters.  Fire engulfs.  Bullets fly.  Blood spills. To paraphrase Billy Sol Hurok and Big Jim McBob things blow up real good .  Most touching of all is in between all the orchestrated mayhem formerly estranged father(Bruce Willis) and son(Jai Courtney) bond while dispatching bad guys.  There is a negligible plot about weapons grade uranium stashed in the ruins of Chernobyl but that's a mere distraction from watching things go BOOM. Willis still has that sly wily charm to make this a decent time filler.  That said it probably should be happy trails to this once formidable franchise.,1385510400,,645,5.134615384615385

By this point he had outed his son as a spy, torpedoed his operation and done more damage to the Russian capitol than the Germans did to Stalingrad in 1942.  If you feel compelled to watch this, try Gigli or Battlefield Earth instead.

I have been well entertained by most of the previous chapters of this film saga but clearly A Good Day to Die Hard is the weakest of this very entertaining series.  Storyline was weak and Bruce didn't seem to have the same motivation he displayed in the previous films.  Using the angle of helping his son as a means to attract a younger audience was a good idea that was not done properly.  The story was barely believable and lacked the vitality of the prior ones.

Bruce Willis broke out in that movie and became the surly bald guy we know and love today.  Each Die hard movie after the first was good or interested in its own way but never as good as the original.  Now, Die Hard 5 was interesting.  The action was pretty great.  The dialog and story were so-so.  It honestly felt like a ""well I'm under contract so let's get this over with"" was how the movie was approached, filmed, and released.

All that being said, some I enjoy a good mindless movie from time to time.  Let's pretend this isn't a Die Hard movie and it's definitely a fun action romp with no point and some cool...well...action.  Other than that it's very very far from the Die Hard root and only makes me want to go back and watch the original.

5397000,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"I have enjoyed all the Die Hard movies, understanding that they are over the top and ridiculous.  However, this movie was just awfully ridiculous.  The acting grade F. Its as if Bruce woke up hungover one day and got a call from a producer and this is what happened:
Producer- ""Bruce! Whats up...wanna make some money today?""
BRUCE - ""argh, sure, why not, will it take long?""
Producer - ""Naw, I have another Die Hard movie in the works, the name alone should draw millions, Ill write the plot before you get here...but I am thinking Russian spy stuff sounds good""
BRUCE - ""Sure, why not, I could use a new house in Malibu""

After Bruce gets to the studio he meets the horrible actors and the hot Russian Chick and says, ""Lets do this!""

So they shoot for one day and then Brucey goes home.  That's all he needed for this trash.  No retakes, or anything because most the action scenes are CGI and the acting so bad, its beyond Grade B movie.  The plot is silly and Bruce's son just seems to be thrown in there.

My friend and I kepy watching and hoping it would be worthy of something.  But the reality is, its awful. DONT waste your time on this movie.  It does not do any of the Die Hard movies justice and for God's sake if you do watching it, DONT WATCH IT on an LCD in HD or you will see just how freaking tired and old Bruce actually is.",1381708800,,1342,4.20703125

5397049,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"Back in 1989 when I worked at the Director's Guild in Hollywood, I walked into the lounge one day and several directors were sitting around discussing what film deserved an Academy award.  They asked me my choice, and I told them I'd vote for Die Hard (The original).  They were not impressed.  Nevertheless, any fan of action films would have enjoyed my choice far more than the films they were discussing.

The Die Hard series is the only film mentioned that day that is still around after all these years.  A Good Day to Die Hard is a first-rate action film because of the action, the humor, and the characters.

The action is full throttle from beginning to end.  Plus, the scenes are fresh.  Willis and Courtney both did a great job.  The humor was subtle, which is what made it good.  Willis had many good lines related to his dysfunctional relationship with his son.  Good dialogue.  Finally, the characters were winners.  Willis' character was almost as good as the original.  Jai Courtney (who played the bitter son) did a great job.  Yuliya Snigir impressed me as well.  She had few lines, but turned out to be a competent villain.  If you like action and humor, I recommend A Good Day to Die Hard. --Roger Weston, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Recruiter-A-Thriller/dp/B007DQ4B6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Recruiter: A Thriller</a>",1380931200,,1405,5.200892857142857

5397109,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"In every film outing of John McClane, the archetypal everyman hero, he has been a man set against impossible odds against enemies that are far more intelligent, more clever, and much better armed... at least on the surface. But because of Bruce Willis's portrayal of McClane's heart and soul, his wit and humor, and his never-say-die attitude, he has prevailed against these odds and these evil people, initially threatening a building, then an airport, then a whole city, and then a nation. But now it's time for John McClane to go on vacation. Unfortunately for him, it's to Russia to bail out his ""criminal"" son (Jai Courtney of SPARTACUS and JACK REACHER, and was quite good in both, but not so much here).

And unfortunately for us, this little vacation abroad proves that the DIE HARD franchise has outlived its usefulness as both a successful franchise in both a monetary and artistic sense as director John Moore (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, the 2006 OMEN remake, MAX PAYNE) creates easily one of the worst films of the year and certainly the worst film (and stupidest title) of this once-revered franchise with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.

The shark was somewhat jumped when John McClane and his slacker/hacker sidekick had to save the US of A from super-cyberterrorism in the Len Wiseman-helmed LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, but it's still an effective and entertaining film (with the exception of the McClane vs. Jet Fighter sequence). But with GOOD DAY, the film is a series of one ridiculous action sequence after another that effectively destroys EVERYTHING lovable and relatable about John McClane. Sure, McClane has a few decent quips and still is his weary self, but he is now elevated to a status of God-like proportions, plowing through cars and blowing away bad guys in a foreign country without consequences and falling from great heights through wooden catwalks with barely a scratch. This was once a man who, before jumping off the roof of a 40-story building with only a fire hose tied around him to support him, took a moment for a prayer (""Oh, God, please don't let me die!""). He knew he was human. He knew he was fallible. And these are faults and weaknesses that have stayed with him for most of the films, but now, he's willing to jump through windows, assured he will land and still live because he has become invincible. This is NOT John McClane.

This is not just the fault of Willis, who is clearly just cashing a check here as he sleepwalks through this film, and it's not just the fault of the writer Skip Woods (whose previous credits include a slew of sub-par actioners like SWORDFISH, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, THE A-TEAM and HITMAN), and it's not just the fault of director Moore, who has shown throughout his career that he's very satisfied with creating films that more closely resemble open-air video games than films that have any hint of decent plotting or style or understanding of character. This is a failure on an institutional level. Fox Studios has a very proud history of taking once-great genre franchises and turning them to intolerable garbage (see ALIEN, PREDATOR, STAR WARS, etc.), and this is only the latest. And as long as we keep giving them money for these films, they will continue to release them.

The rest is up to the audience now. Do yourself a favor and don't buy into the positive reviews here. I can certainly understand and appreciate seeing and loving a film that has almost as many negative reviews as positive, because certain films are meant to be polarizing. But here with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, this is supposed to be mass entertainment that appeals to everyone. It's not meant to challenge your ideology or to shake up the status quo of the industry. It's supposed to be an entertaining night out at the movies. Sadly, it's anything but mass entertainment.

5397113,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"John McClane is back.  Well, actually, a 2 dimensional version of him is, somehow devoid of any of those appealing characteristics of humanity and ""guy-next-door-ness"".  This time, we are led to believe he has a son we have not yet heard about, whom he travels to Moscow to find and restore the family connection he lost some time ago.  His son has taken a career path that astonishingly his pop was unaware of, and McClane Senior and McClane Junior soon bond through killing umpteen anonymous bad guys, plus causing untold injuries and deaths in the populace around them.  To be fair, there are some breathtaking scenes in the car chase through Moscow, with an incredible amount of mayhem, smashing cars and explosions.. which is, let's be truthful, part of why we watch a movie with `Die Hard' in the title.  It's exciting, even though the camera tends to shake around so much you often have just a sense that something exciting is happening, while not being fully aware of what it actually is.  But the buzz isn't sustainable, and as the impressive stuntwork gives way to cgi McClanes flying through the air in the latter half of the movie, our brains are simply unable to hold that disbelief in suspension any more and the movie becomes at best a partial snoozefest.  The latter half of the movie suffers also from the absence of Moscow, which turns out to be quite an inspired choice for a movie like this, which gets replaced with somewhere suitably abandoned and lacking in energy (no pun intended, in case you know the story already).  This might have held together if there was a suitably charismatic villain.. but there isn't one.  The US taking sides with one half of a Moscow oligarch feud seems unlikely and  neither of the the two seem.. well, interesting.  Oh and did I forget to mention Jai Courtney plays McClane's son?  Mmmhh - probably because my brain is already forgetting about it.  Not so much because of the performance, just that the script never really lets him come into his own.
Maybe I am being a bit harsh.. after all, this is quite a routine and acceptable action flick.  But the thing is, I loved Die Hard.  I maybe wasn't quite sure why at the time, but unfortunately I have movies such as this to clarify it to me. Die Hard allowed our action heroes to be more human and vulnerable while still delivering thrills and action.  The action was precise and thrilling not because it was unbelievable, but because we were amazed to find it happening to this guy we accepted as belonging in the real world.  With this movie, we are firmly back into the 80's territory we were rescued from in the first place, of supermen we can't believe in and abundant action that loses its thrill pretty quickly.

5397154,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Despite the bad reviews, I figured I should probably see A Good Day to Die Hard since I've seen all of the other Die Hard movies and liked at least one of them. Okay, maybe two of them. However, I went in with low expectations. This is the series in which the protagonist survives the explosion of a boat by jumping into the water next to the boat. Because, you know, being in the water totally protects you from explosions in the water. So, not only do we have that, but this one, the 5th (and I'd totally lost track, at this point, that this was the 5th one), was actually getting pretty horrible reviews.

It seems I did not lower my expectations far enough. Good Day fails at pretty much every level of story telling and movie making. Well, except for the explosions. It has plenty of those, which, in the Michael Bay theory of movie making, is all you need to make a good movie. I have to suppose John Moore and Skip Woods (the director and writer, respectively) are Bay disciples.

The first real mistake the movie makes is having the movie open with McClane's son instead of with McClane himself. It's Die Hard; we're here to see John McClane, not junior. To make it worse, they just throw the audience into the middle of a situation for which there is no context. This is one of the reasons I hate that whole ""start in the middle of the action"" ""rule."" They definitely did that with this movie. However, not knowing anything about the characters or the situation, there is no way real way to know whom we should be caring about, so we don't really care about anyone. Of course, this all ends, as we come to find out, with John Jr. (Jack) in a Russian prison. And, as my wife said, ""What? I didn't even know he had a son.""

The issue here is that there is an expectation that we will care about Jack because John cares about Jack. Except we don't have any context, really, for John caring about Jack since he's barely mentioned or seen in the other movies. Conveniently enough, John has suddenly chosen this moment to care about Jack, whom he has not spoken to in years, and has had one of his old cop buddies track Jack down for him just at the time that Jack is arrested and thrown into a Russian prison. Of course, there is no good reason why McClane's cop friend should be able to find out that undercover CIA agent Jack McClane has been thrown into a top Russian prison. Especially within what seems to be hours of it happening. Not that McClane even knows that his son is CIA.

Being John McClane, he just jumps on a plane to Russia with some vague expectation that he will be able to connect with his son when he gets there. His son that is in a top, possibly top secret, Russian prison. And, of course, without planning it, he happens to arrive on the day that his son is going to appear in Russian court as a witness against the guy that Jack is supposed to be saving. And, also of course, he stumbles into the middle of a prison break/abduction of the guy that Jack is supposed to be saving (and also testifying against).

This is where we expect, I guess, John McClane to become ""yippee-ki-yay"" John instead of old, tired John that we find at the beginning of the movie. But we don't get that. No, what we get is John chasing his son around during the middle of a fire fight trying to talk to him about how sorry he is that he wasn't there for him when he was a kid. I think it was supposed to be funny. I think. But it didn't even rise to the level of ludicrous as John meanders through the bullets and explosions and, eventually, when his son takes off in a vehicle without him, steals a truck to follow his son while yelling, ""I'm not through talking to you!""

And through all of this we have been given no real reason as to why this guy Jack needs to save is so important other than that the CIA want him and that some muckety-muck Russian wants him dead. Or abducted. And the guy's daughter is involved, except we're not supposed to know that, but as soon as the dude tells McClane that he has a daughter, I knew it was his daughter that was the woman in the group trying to capture and/or kill the dude. And also of course no one turns out to be on the sides they're presented to be on except McClane, the sadist bad guy, and the dead people.

Possibly the worst bit, which is saying a lot considering how terribly the movie began, is when Jack overhears John telling the Russian dude about how bad a parent he was and how bad he feels about it and how all he wants to do is make everything right with Jack. But, since, Jack hears John saying this, we are spared any action or work on the part of John to repair his relationship with his son, because his son, now, understands that his dad worked all the time because of how much he loved Jack. And, then, of course, they bond over killing the bad guys and everything is okay.

I'm not making it out to be as bad as it really is. It was bad enough that, before the hour mark, my wife decided that she was through with the movie. I'm not actually sure why I finished watching it other than the fact that I have a hard time stopping something once I've started it no matter how bad it is. That this movie was bad wasn't even the worst part about it. It just felt completely inauthentic. McClane's actions didn't feel authentic (Who, really, just jumps in a plane and flies to Russia with the vague plan of getting in to see someone in a Russian prison? John was a cop; he, theoretically, knows how this stuff works and it's beyond far-fetched that he, even being John McClane, would just hop in a plane without contacting the State Department or something). The fact that Jack refers to his father as ""McClane"" didn't feel authentic (Seriously? ""Damn you, McClane"" is the best they could come up with for Jack to say? I buy him calling his father ""John"" but the whole ""McClane was a stretch the rubber band couldn't take). The whole conflict of the movie involving Russia and nukes didn't feel authentic. It's not the 80s anymore.

So, yeah, give me more of escaping explosions by jumping into the water next to the boat that's exploding. At least that was just a brief moment of stupidity unlike the stupidity that was this movie from beginning to end. And that doesn't even cover how dumb the title is, because, if you're going to use the phrase ""a good day to die,"" you need to actually have it be relevant to the movie, but no... no relation at all. Just a cool title. But, then, a cool title doesn't make a cool movie.",1378339200,2,6495,4.295510204081633

5397180,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"I must add a few criteria here:  First off, I am quite fond of the Die Hard films--I still consider the original to be the best and a genuinely great bit of fun from beginning to end.  And while Die Hard 2 is essentially more of the same thing, the further sequels always added something new and entertaining to the table.

And then we get to A Good Day to Die Hard, and it doesn't please me to tell you guys this, but not only is this by far the worst entry in the Die Hard series, it's also one of the worst action movies I've ever seen.  I will not dare attempt to sum of what passes here for a plot here because frankly, the movie doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  No attempt to make any sense is ever made.  Ever.  It's a film filled with explosive setpieces and heavy expository dialogue trying desperately to explain to us what is going on, and doesn't give us any straight answers.  It's pretentiously vague, and at 98 minutes, feels closer to 2 hours (thankfully, it doesn't feel much longer than that).  And it comes off rather like the people who were putting the film together were just making it up as they went.

The script was written by Skip Woods, who also wrote the scripts for Swordfish, Hitman, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and The A-Team, which more than explains why nothing about this film makes any sense and feels made up as it went on.  Director John Moore was also the director of Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix, Max Payne, and the remake of The Omen, which in turn explains why the film is humorless, witless, and pretentious to the enth degree.  Combining the talents of two such hacks, it's a miracle that Bruce Willis's John McClane is still left in tact and in respect to the character at large.  The only other actor worth mentioning is Jai Courtney as John ''Jack'' McClane Jr., who is a CIA secret agent stationed in Moscow, and is an arrogant little baffoon, who tries and fails miserably at giving out one-liners.  Everyone else is forgettable.

One would be more than willing to throw suspension of disbelief out the window with these action set pieces if they were entertaining, but they are not.  The worst part about this film--and indeed, the worst trait of any real action film, especially a Die Hard film?  It's boring.  Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring!  One's ethusiasm for the franchise dampens somewhat after hearing from Bruce Willis himself that there is still one more movie to go before the franchise comes to a close.  With any luck, it will more than make up for the sins of this entry, so there still exists a small sliver of hope.

There's very little of merit in this film.  But given that--while defanged and not as witty or engaging as in past installments--John McClane still remains faithful to who he was, and Bruce Willis still gives a good, but aged performance, this film is more than spared a rare 0 out of 10--John McClane here is an 8, and as such, one of the most important characteristics of this series remains in good condition.

""A Good Day"" has  good story line between the two lead characters, unfortunately the car chases and explosions didn't allow the characters to have enough of the interactions that characterized the first movie.

5397209,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"I read no reviews of this movie prior to watching it, so I had few preconceived notions about it. Having viewed and enjoyed all of the other Die Hard movies, I expected this movie to be another fun outing in the series. While quite a bit different from some of the other Die Hard movies, this movie succeeds on most every level. It had plenty of the stuff I was expecting and wanting to see: loads of action, exotic locations, witty tough-guy banter, some despicable bad guys and some father-son conflict. Highlights of the movie include one of THE BEST car chases I've ever seen in a movie and a David-versus-Goliath battle between the main characters and a military attack helicopter. If you want more plot synopsis, I'm sure you can find plenty of other reviews to fill you in on those details. I'll just leave you to them and give you this recommendation: If what you're looking for is a fun, low-brow action movie to waste away an evening or afternoon with, this movie will definitely fit the bill and leave you entertained.",1377648000,,1029,4.5978260869565215

However it is time to bury John McClaine if this movie is any indication of the story-line quality we can expect in the future.

CONTINUAL trite plot tactic - bad guys, all special forces-type soldiers CAN'T hit anyone with machine guns. Good guys, handguns, one shot kills.

We knew from the reviews that this was going to be an 'over the top' action film, but the action sequences are so long, with so few breaks they actually get pretty tedious.  I found myself going to the kitchen to gt a drink while things were blowing up, because things just kept blowing up.

There are a few pretty original action sequences that were really cool - the side of a building rigged to blow as part of an escape route, driving OVER cars sideways in a traffic jam - and Willis and his 'son' both do  great job delivering fully developed characters you believe in, but since they're so busy blowing things up and avoiding getting killed, you don't get hang out with them at all - which is too bad.

So, if you love Bruce Willis, watch Fifth Element (Willis & Mila J) and 13 Monkeys (Willis & Brad Pitt), or Die Hard 1 and 2 which are truly great movies...  and you can watch this too.. if you want.",1377302400,,984,4.207446808510638

Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed.  While the action sequences are good, the poorly developed plot and atrocious dialogue absolutely crippled the pace of the film.  When you see many people in the audience checking their watches (or phones) to look at the time 2/3rds of the way through the movie, you know it's not a good sign. IMO, the third movie, 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' was the weakest of the series... until now.

I enjoyed the Die Hard Movies when the characters were what drove the movies.  While ""Live Free and Die Hard"", relied heavily upon their special effects it was the characters, both the ones I rooted for and the ones I hated that kept me interested.

In this, the latest of the series, I was beginning to wish everyone would just die and get it over with.  It felt like a series of action sequences that were stapled together with a quip.

I could list each of my issues out, scene by scene, but they would go on and on.

I would have thought that my dislike would come from Bruce Willis' age, that is not an issue.  The issue is the character interactions, whomever wrote the script was paid too much for too little substance.

Since day one of it's release in 1988, I have been a huge fan of the original Die Hard - a brilliantly paced thriller with truly witty dialogue and engaging characters, both bad and good - and have bought it on VHS, then DVD, and finally Blu-Ray. This movie consists of nothing but mindless destruction, crashes, shooting, fighting and stilted forced dialogue.

Turns out, unbeknownst to the elder McClane, Junior (Jai Courtney), who's apparently more of a chip off the old block than dad ever imagined, is actually an undercover agent for the C.I.A., foiling terrorist plots seemingly on a daily basis.

Papa McClane isn't there five minutes before he's turned the streets of Moscow into a veritable demolition derby - honestly, Godzilla didn't wreak this kind of havoc on Tokyo even on his worst day - and the movie itself into a smoldering ruin.

In the screenplay by Skip Woods, nothing less than the fate of the free world hangs in the balance, while Junior works out his daddy issues amid a hail of bullets and a fusillade of explosions.  The quips and wisecracks and ""you weren't there for me when I was growing up"" whining pall early on, and all we're left with in the final analysis is a bunch of scowling Russians and the wholesale destruction of everything animate and inanimate unfortunate enough to wind up in the McClanes' path.

This was not the best of the set, but it was satisfyingly similar enough, and true enough to the storyline to make it worthwhile. What was glaringly wrong? John would never have behaved like he did when first confronting his son. The cool thing about John, in every preceeding movie, is that he is saavy and aware -- even if he's hungover, or beaten down -- of what's really going down, before anyone else is. He wouldn't have blocked traffic and scolded his son, screaming in the street. That's not our John; it made him look ridiculous, and I fault the director for that -- this character is too well known and understood to make him act that stupid. The actor playing the son was believable as ""Jack"" in looks and manner. The story was plausible enough, and the setting was unique. As always, Willis delivered the rough-and-tumble, loveable tough guy we adore and love to root for, as only he can do. I hope he knows he's brought joy and entertainment to us all with this saga of John's attempt to always protect his family with all of his strength and cunning in the harshest-ever, most-extreme circumstances imaginable -- wherever that may be.",1376006400,,1257,4.566371681415929

5397411,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"""SO YOUR SON is a Psycho"" makes a better subtitle for this fifth outing in the ""Die Hard"" series. We met John McClane's (Bruce Willis) daughter in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007), an over the top production with as many laughs as action sequences. Can you forget McClane surfing into the city on the wing of a crashing plane? Featuring Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and Justin Long as a young hacker, it is the series' highest grossing film to date.

We only see Lucy in the theater edition of ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" No. 5 is all about McClane's reunion with his homicidally intense son, Jack (Jai Courtney, ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Spartacus"") and, while the movie is full of complicated action and fight scenes, it is a much darker outing. In fact, it's hard to recognize as a ""Die Hard"" story. Director John Moore, of ""Max Payne"" (2008), and unnecessary remakes such as ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" (2004) and ""The Omen"" (2006), went on record before filming that he felt viewers were done with the humor.

Seriously - who put this guy in charge?

McClane has always been the good guy in the bad place, dropping one-liners as fast as he drops villains. Here he must be as wary with his son as he is with the bad guys. Son Jack is a member of the CIA; his mission to save a Russian politician finds him on the path to a Russian prison. Dad drops into Moscow to keep Jack out of jail. They haven't spoken in years, so he only learns of his son's career choice while guns are blazing and buildings are exploding. ""We only kill the bad guys,"" McClane says repeatedly. It could be an attempt to keep Jack on the straight and narrow.

Whoo - we have stepped into an alt-world Die Hard under this director. Jack is bad, bad news, and we've got to wonder how he got this way. This can't be our hero's son. But there are no explanation except, like Lucy, Jack complains that Dad wasn't around enough.

We don't see or hear anything from Willis in the high-def extras, which feature a highly technical, multi-part making-of and a special feature, ""The Anatomy of a Car Chase."" The movie opens with a long and complicated action sequence that, despite all the non-CG thrills, takes up too much time. I wish - along with critics and other ""Die Hard"" fans - they'd spent more time on story and character. We can see from the extras that director Moore and assistant director Mark Cotone's interests lie in pyrotechnics and stunts. Moore and Cotone also provide an enthusiastic and sadly enlightening commentary. We don't hear anything from writer Skip Woods.

It's not easy to choose between the extended and theater version. There's little more than three minutes difference in length. The extended edition ends with McClane and son walking out of Chernobyl, while the theatrical shows an unbelievable family reunion that doesn't fit the bleak story.

A great big, beefy stud of a man, he added a lot to the story (wouldn't have minded seeing him wearing a lot less, but that's just me).  I don't think the villains were quite as ruthless as previous ones.

I could see Jai taking over the role that Bruce started.  He has a certain tough guy attitude and presence that will serve him well.  And he has plenty of experience (I didn't recognize him from his stint in Spartacus).",1375660800,,576,4.428571428571429

If memory serves, they used mostly Russian and Eastern European crew to save additional money. The whole production probably cost them 60% of what they'd have spent in the U.S.

I  wish our U.S. actors would have our backs (the backs of the U.S. crews) by putting it into their contracts that they will not appear in any film that is helping bust the IATSE and associated unions for film and video crews.

5397447,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"Having viewed the first four films in the franchise and being let down by ""Die Hard 2"" and the last entry, I was ambivalent about the latest installment, until the teaser poster and first two trailers were released, which made me hope that the series would be going back to its R-rated roots. Sure enough, I was right. The latest entry in the Die Hard series is reminiscent of the first three films in terms of content, only that the violence is more graphic, and the language is tempered down a bit. However, never fear. John McClane's signature phrase is uncensored this time around (unlike the fourth film, where it was inexplicably toned down for a PG-13 rating, though there was still some moderate-to-strong profanity that should have earned it an R-rating).

The plot of the fifth film isn't as strong as ""Die Hard"" and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance,"" but it's definitely much better than ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" and the actor playing the main villain may not be as well-known as Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons, but he still did a good job. Shame that the great Michael Kamen (who scored the first three movies, plus all of the ""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""Licence To Kill,"" ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" and Disney's ""The Three Musketeers"") is no longer with us to provide another great score for another ""Die Hard"" movie.

My only quibbles are with the profaning of God's Name (i.e., combining the Name of God with a mild profanity, thereby turning it into a strong religious profanity; God saith, ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord Thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain."") and for some reason, several scene extensions and at least one scene in the trailer were not in the movie. Why is that scenes in a trailer are cut from the movie before theatrical release? and the so-called ""Extended Cut"" is not really an extended cut, as Mary Elizabeth Winnstead is cut from the film in that version, and the additions are insignificant. The movie should have had a stronger script, ala Die Hard or Die Hard With A Vengeance.

Yippee-ki-yay. My ranking of the ""Die Hard"" movies is as follows.

I. ""Die Hard""

II. ""Die Hard With A Vengeance""

III. ""A Good Day To Die Hard""

IV. ""Die Hard 2""

V. ""Live Free Or Die Hard""

5397466,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"Original Review:
Sorry, ten minutes into this movie and I was cleaning up my house instead of watching the movie.  (I let the movie continue to play for background noise, catching scenes here and there.)  It was just lacking something the other Die Hard movies had.  I absolutley LOVE the other 4 movies!  (Not to mention that I love John McClain's signature phrase!)  I have yet to sit down and watch it again.  It was just a bit on the boring side.  I heard a rumor that they are coming out with a sixth movie too, possible called ""Die Hardest"".  Maybe they'll bring Holly back.  Might be nice to see John settle down with the wife that started it all at the Nakatomi Tower.

Added a Year Later:
I have sat down and watched the whole movie now, without getting up to clean house.  I must say, this is the worst Die hard movie.  It was lacking.  Definitely did not live up to the Die Hard name.  I'll leave the 3 stars because although it was not good, it was not bad either.  The movie takes place in Europe, not on American soil.  John meets up with his son this time who wants nothing to do with his father (poor John).  I must say, I prefer the daughter in Live Free or Die Hard, she had an attitude and a mouth on her!  The son...just seems like he wants to be serious and get the job done, no love and no laughter.  And also, John's signature phrase (""Yippee Kai Ah..."") felt like it was thrown in at the last minute just to be sure it got into the movie.  So, to sum up, definitely not as good as the other 4, but so bad to make me want to burn it in the fire pit.",1375488000,,1572,4.091803278688524
5397467,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"I've generally enjoyed the Die Hard franchise; especially the first film in the series.  This turkey, ""A Good Day To Die Hard"", was a complete waste of time and money.  It is so bad that it is just one more of those movies that I have to ask myself:  ""Why did they even bother making it""?  It was an easily answered question: ""It's the money, stupid"".  This movie is nothing more than a con, a means of getting you to spend your hard-earned bucks and using it's past successes to lure you into believing that you're going to be entertained by another over-the-top action movie.  ""A Good Day..."" is loud and obnoxious and so ridiculous in virtually every aspect of it's production that I was barely able to sit through the whole mess. Among the more annoying aspects of this movie is the fact that there is not even the merest hint of character development.  McClane's son, played by Jai Courtney, is just there, a totally unlikeable character from the get go.  There is absolutely no believable chemistry between Willis and Courtney.  I never believed for a second that there was any kind of father-son bond.  There was, of course, the obligatory and woefully unconvincing reconciliation scene where father and son have to fess up that they actually love one another, etc.  Because of the animosity displayed by the son throughout the movie towards his father up to that point, it was an obvious set-up for this scene--and a wasted one.  I just had absolutely no feelings about ANY of the characters in this film, let alone this totally unbelievable father-son relationship.

Even the bad guys stunk in this film.  Rasha Bukvic tried to play one the main badass heavies and seemed to be trying--and completely failing--to channel Christoph Waltz from ""Inglorious Basterds"".  He was so unconvincing that I was just sorry that he was not terminated earlier than he was just to be done with his horrible acting. I won't even bother to get into the pathetic script, dialogue and plot holes.  Suffice it to say that this wannabe buddy movie was a complete disaster from beginning to end.  I would strongly recommend that you not waste your money on watching it as I did.  If you're going to watch it, wait until it shows up as a free offering sometime in the near future.  It will still waste your time, but at least you won't have squandered your money on it.",1375488000,,2355,4.658595641646489

5397472,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"The film was ok. If you want to watch Bruce Willis shoot people, then watch this movie. Or any other movie he's ever been in. The fourth film in the series was great (totally unrealistic, but an awesome action flick), whereas this one was really let down by all the nagging from the son. He's supposed to be some secret agent, yet he can't sense when something's wrong, he has no intuition, and he spends nearly the whole movie complaining about how much Bruce Willis sucked as a father. Of course by the end (as with the other films) the relationship has been repaired and they walk off into the distance as best friends.

For me, this film was not worth making. It was barely worth watching. The action scenes were good, and it was interesting (I guess) to see McClain in Russia, but it was basically like watching any of the other Die Hard movies. My favourite scene was where McClain pushes the bad guy off the roof and they shoot it the same way as when Alan Rickman was pushed off the roof all those years back. This made me wonder if they were planning on rebooting the whole series with the son as the main character. (Oh god no!)

Overall, basic action film that really is only worth watching if you like Bruce Willis or the son (whose name I can't remember - Jai?).",1375401600,,1275,4.375527426160337

The fifth instalment in the beloved ""Die Hard"" saga ends up as the worst of the series so far; it falters thanks to a weak characterization, even weaker screen writing, lack of worthy villains, absurd action sequences and incoherent direction. You can bet this movie will be mentioned in the same sentence with ""Rocky V"", ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"", ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", ""Die Another Day"" and ""Batman & Robin"".

So the car chases have time to develop their full richness and subtlety.  But, alas, we lead off with a long sequence in which a giant military truck roars down the street, using its size to destroy any vehicles in its way.  This occurs early in the film, and seems almost wasted without some setup time to develop our interest in the participants.  Anyway, there's no fun in seeing a heavyweight beat up on a flyweight.  Later, I recall someone driving an SUV down a crowded street on top of the other cars, which is a much more amusing take on car chases.  Or that may be in a Jason Bourne film I saw at about the same time.  Anyway, lots of cars were sacrificed in making this film.

It was different but I enjoyed it and look forward to number six, in the next film I hope they create a more complex bad guy that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I still give it four stars because it's Bruce Willis and it's a Die Hard movie even the Bond films have had ups and downs but I didn't come away feeling that I wasted my time watching this movie.

5397540,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Come now... On its own this film stands up as a semi-decent action film of the Bruce Willis ilk. It's crashy and smashy and at times unbelievable, and it's all served up in a predictably Hollywood-esque style. Nothing wrong with that at all. But to call this a ""Die Hard"" film (I've really enjoyed all of the quadrilogy before this) just doesn't sit well with me. If I was a cynic (and I am) I'd say this was a hardly-camouflaged let's-make-a-quick-buck flick which jumps kicking and screaming onto the back of a great reputation and does it no good whatsoever.

I had to trawl through a few sites to remind myself that previous films have shown that McClane even has a son at all - let's face it he's hardly been a regular in the series and I was watching the film thinking ""Where has this son suddenly come from!?"". The setting is random and I can imagine red lights and alarms going off in the corridors of the Kremlin itself if the name McClane went within seven hundred miles of an Aeroflot check-in desk. I mean, he's got to be on some kind of watch list of ""People where stuff seems to blow up around them on a regular basis"" by now... I'm not really sure why this film wasn't called something like ""Bruce Willis Cracks a Horrid Russian Gang And It's A Bit Like Die Hard"", because in my view this isn't a Die Hard film. It's decent enough, and if it's on telly in 5 years time I'll probably sit there patiently wading through the adverts till gone midnight when I really should've gone to bed earlier on a school night. But the lightness and comedy interspersed within the seriousness wasn't present. There are no evil henchmen arguing quietly over whether to take a bomb in their car with them in order to protect children from finding it in the street. There's no ""I've think I've just seen...Elvis. Elvis Presley"" moments.

It's also gone down an intelligence notch. Radiation hoovering? I mean, McClane did ""shoot"" down a chopper with a car in the previous film but at least that was pure boyish silliness. And it might work in real life...maybe...possibly...well OK... But neutralising radiation with a vaccuum cleaner had me shaking my head a little. Nobody (not even me in my most open-minded mood) can take that seriously.",1375056000,,2237,4.576059850374065

Director: John Moore.

Running Time: 97 minutes.

Rated: R for Violence and Language.

Ugh.

I'm not a person to get bored easily. I can be easily amused by even the pettiest of entertainment from time to time. But when a film has car crashes, helicopter fights, swear words, big firefights and other such things and I'm bored to feath, there's something horribly wrong in the world. Such is the case with A Good Day to Die Hard or Die Hard 5, which ever strikes your fancy.

I've only seen two Die Hard movies in my life: The first one and the fourth one. The first film is often seen as a classic in action - and to an extent, Christmas - cinema, combining great action, suspense, performances, a charismatic villain, good plotting and its very likable and relatable protagonist by the name of John McClane, played by the always ready and willing Bruce Willis.

The fourth one, Live Free Or Die Hard, has some contention with the fanbase. While it was a critical and commercial success, some viewed it as taking away the Die Hard spirit with a PG-13 rating and the fact John McClane was driving cars into helicopters. To me, it never really bothered me and while I only watched that film once, I do remember having fun with it, with it's interesting take on cyber terrorism and the fact that McClane was taking on a baddie who isn't like other folks he dealt with before.

Now how could I summarize the plot of A Good Day to Die Hard? Well, I wish I could give you, the reader, some kind of way to provide a synopsis of this film, so I'll do so the best I can. So, McClane  goes to Russia to meet up with a son he never had never met before, Jack McClane (Jai Courtney). Jack is actually working on a case with the CIA protecting a witness in a trail, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), who is caught up in a Nuclear weapon heist. Right when the trial is about to begin, a bunch of baddies show up and attempt to kidnap Komarov. Soon, John and Jack must get over their family issues and team up to protect Komarov or something like that.

Attempting to get invested in the film's plot is like trying to perform nuclear science. Every single character in the film is basically a cardboard cutout, without a nice tasty amount of cliche slapped on `em. We get almost no character development or we barely get to know them. Hell, the kid goes from hating his dad to loving him near the end and it comes off forced as hell. This one villain played by Radivoje Bukvic, lacks any kind of menace or charisma in the film. His most memorable scene is him kicking the guns away from our main heroes, tap dancing and eating a Carrot. And when its revealed of who the true bad guy is (yes, we're dealing with one of those again), even when I had it spoiled for myself, it still came off as a really pathetic twist.

As I mentioned earlier, the film is just flat out boring. Right from the get go, there is no flair or joy from this film. All of it, from the editing to the pacing and looks, it all feels workman-like. Oh sure, characters crack wise and the McClanes spew playful insults at each other but it all ends up feeling so incredibly hollow. Hell, I'm one of those people that will defend a movie by saying ""It's just a movie! Deal with it!"" and even here, I had a really hard time buying things like McClanes jumping into an obviously radiated pool of water and surviving or John surviving an insane car chase with nary a scratch, And on the acting side of things, it just gets worse from there.

Bruce Willis just looks bored here. Hell, everyone does. No one hams it up in any capacity or has fun with what they are doing. It's almost as if everyone here is phoning it in just to get themselves a tasty paycheck, which given the material, is pretty understandable. I'm also under the slight impression that everyone who was in the making of the film was taking some kind of amphetamine or something, just do get through the days of shooting.

One has to wonder who the hell wrote and directed this. Previous Die Hard movies usually have either loads or some degree of talent behind the camera but they came up short with director John Moore, who's previous works include a shot-for-shot remake of The Omen and the film adaptation of Max Payne. Meanwhile, screenwriting duties were given to Skip Woods, who's resume includes such works like X-Men Origins Wolverine and Hitman. These men are not directors and screenwritiers; They are goddamn boot-licking leeches that got lucky. That is all.

Surprisingly, I found the action to be pretty decently shot. While others jump on the gun and yell ""Shaky Cam"", I could always tell what was going on, even during it more crazier moments. The only problem it becomes a problem to see is near the end, thanks to the poor lighting during the night time scenes. Christ, it made feel like I was watching the opening of The Avengers all over again, but without the benefit of knowing I'd get something good out of it. Meanwhile, the CG used in the film is questionable at best. At times, it really shows that it is fake as hell in the most numbing of ways.

If there are any good things to say about the film, I would say that the film does come off as gun-porn at times, which is nice I guess. There's also a semi-charming scene between McClane and a Russian cabbie as they talk about Frank Sinatra and how s***ty the traffic is. Unsurprisingly, that's one of the film's most publicized scenes.

To summarize myself before I get the desire to claw out my eyeballs with a pair of trimming shears, don't even bother watching A Good Day To Die Hard. Dull action, a silly and incomprehensible plot, bland acting, and poor character development mar this film to hell and back. And to those that say ""I can't shut off my brain and just watch the movie"", I say this:

Do you know what's a good action movie that I can turn my brain off to? The Crank films. Bad Boys II. The first Transformers flick. Armageddon. There's plenty of dumb as hell movies I can shut my brain off and sit back and watch, but AGTDH is not one of them.

It's a real shame that something like this can get greenlit while a good R-Rated action flick like DREDD bombs at the box office. Hell, a goddamn trailer for Sharknado looks like it has more invention and charm than this entire movie. What kind of cinema-going world do we live today, anyway? I'm not going to go on a rant about the death of cinema, like some film snob-wannabe, but Jesus Christ, all I can do is just sight in disappointment.",1374796800,,6790,4.4560838033843675

If you're looking for action and another exciting addition to the Die Hard series than look no further however!  Bruce Willis brings back John McClane as a mature father and tough middle aged cop with great success and the depiction of modern Moscow is bustling, busy, and timely.  No doubt some cultural feel for the mighty city in the east was done to bring this feel home to the film and it was done with great success.  There is one scene that is a little far fetched as John drives a stolen Range Rover over the roofs of cars in traffic, but what the heck, this isn't the only stretched reality that you will be asked to believe during the film.  I streamed this movie from Amazon Prime for a couple of bucks and truly got my moneys worth and had a great time.  To quote Adam Carolla, ""Bruce looks like the kind of guy who drives cars fast and shoots guns and that's why we like to see him do it on film"".  Absolutely.

5397645,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"John Moore delivers a great action picture with a fantastic visual aesthetic done with 35mm film not that digital crap most directors use nowadays without knowing what they're doing, frantic & choppy editing and overall a very kinetic structure. The script is o.k. and the relationship between the two McClanes plays out nicely. All the actors fit into their parts and deliver right on the spot. The film basically is an action fest reminiscent of action films of the 80s, with not too much CGI but huge set pieces that gradually get destroyed. The fact that so many people bash this film while current cinema offers wave after wave of truly idiotic movies that get great accolades from the same people is incredible. The criticism about the action scenes being to much to be survived is really worth something from people who are otherwise more than willing to invest themselves into all kinds of fantasy BS delivered around the clock, get a life damn it! The same goes for the criticism about too much CGI in the picture, Pacific Rim/The Hobbit/Superhero movie of the month are you kidding me?
A Good Day to Die Hard is a great movie AND a great Die Hard, unlike the toothless, boring, stereotypical, embarassingly contemporary Live Free or Die Hard that even Timothy Olyphant couldn't save. Die Hard 5 is better than both Die Hard 4 and 2 and even Die Hard 3. No Die Hard will probably ever match the first one, but in terms of delivering a great action experience with McClane thrown into unexpected cirumstances again is a complete success in my opinion, I had a ball watching it!

5397646,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"I am a huge fan of the Die Hard series and of Bruce Willis' work in them, however A Good Day to Die Hard is terrible as one in the series. From the very start, John McClain's presence in Russia is unnecessary. In fact, had McClain not shown up, the entire story would have resolved itself properly within minutes. Gone is McClain's Involuntary drafting into action - he willingly throws himself at every event and into every conflict without knowing the players involved or why he should be doing what he's doing.

As an action film, A Good Day to Die Hard has a number of packed set pieces of action eye-candy, but the plot is ridiculous and the concepts preposterous. It's not a terrible way to eat some popcorn, but there are better action movies than this, and if you're a Die Hard fan, do yourself a favor and watch any of the previous four before opting for this one.",1374364800,,873,4.422360248447205

Good: Bruce Willis is himself, although he kind of phones in the role; Lots of cars crushed by larger cars; Cool guns and helicopters; Moderately interesting plot twist.

Bad: John McClane's son, one of the heroes, is horribly unlikable, coming off as a whiny ingrate; None of the characters is ever really developed in any way, so you won't care what happens to them; Willis' character sets off to Russia to save his son from the Russian authorities, but spends the whole movie quipping ""I was supposed to be on vacation.""  No you weren't!  You were at best supposed to be there plotting strategy with lawyers and sitting through trial proceedings.  At worst you were going to watch him go to prison.  There was no expectation of vacation.  It's a stupid line!  Dialogue is canned and boring; one-liners could have been pulled from other movies, or maybe made up by the crew's kids.

Skip this movie and re-watch Die Hard I or II instead.",1374278400,,1033,4.662983425414365

Soundtrack music under action scenes is lousy. A lengthy vehicle chase sequence through the congested streets of Moscow is clearly a CGI cartoon. It and the various shootout scenes are BORING. Worst is the plot: John McLane (Bruce Willis), who throughout the movie says he's in Russia on vacation, falls into a lot of trouble when he helps out his son, a CIA spook. ""Jack"" John McLane Jr. (Jai Courtney) persistently calls his dad by his Christian name. You KNOW that'll change by the fadeout.

The plot is confusing, subtitle translations of Russian are too small and disappear too fast. The story's a miasma of cross double-cross that's too tedious to sort out. Best thing about it is a new Rolling Stones song heard during the credit scroll. Amazing that Mick Jagger at nearly 70 can still rock hard.

What I saw was a very commercial, linear script, very predictable hence a bit less entertaining. Yes the traditional Die Hard plot where McLane goes alone against all odds, get stuck and just at the last moment, when all seems to go bad, he finds the solution, and with a big bang nails the bad guys etc etc. This plot is different, it is more family oriented, and I predict that the next episode will be even more into family matters.

5397678,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"I've been a big fan of Bruce Willis since the days of MOONLIGHTING. When he headed for the big screen I remained a fan. That being the case each time I've heard that a new DIE HARD movie was coming out I found myself excited to see what would happen next. I even enjoyed LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD which many critics savaged. Unfortunately I'll have to join them this time around with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.

This time around John McClane (Willis) heads for Russia when his son Jack (Jai Courtney) is on trial for murder there. The film opens with us learning about two political rivals, ex-business partners Komarov (Sebastian Koch) and Chagarin. Komarov is imprisoned by his former partner who will release him if he would only provide him with a file he hid years ago. Instead, Komarov intends to try and speak his peace before a court, if Chagarin will allow it to happen.

As John heads to the courthouse to help his son, his son sits in an enclosed cell in the courtroom next to Komarov after telling the police that he will implicate Komarov if they will lighten his sentence. That all changes when a set of vehicles parked outside the courthouse explode and a team intent on extricating Komarov enters guns blazing. Jack rescues Komarov and they head to a waiting vehicle only to be stopped by John delaying Jack's rescue.

It turns out that Jack is working for the CIA and was there to help Komarov all along. But John has no idea and instead screws things up. A chase through the highways of Moscow between Jack's van and the armored vehicle in pursuit follows with John trying to catch up in a vehicle he commandeers. This leads to a far too long chase sequence that involves more vehicles than one would think are even available in Moscow.

In the end they escape through John's intervention, head for a safe house and John learns what his son's job is all about. Before the happy reunion can go any further, another team sweeps in to catch Komarov and both McClanes must do their best to rescue him and keep him out of harms way while trying to devise an escape plan.

More twists and turns in the plot follow with an over abundant amount of destruction. Buildings are blown apart by high caliber ammunition sprayed by a helicopter as well as machine gun fire aplenty. This movie must have had a tie in with some window manufacturer as the deadly duo either shoots out or jumps through more windows by the end of the film than are seen in most films.

It all ends up in a final shoot out that involves the same helicopter, hand grenades, machine guns, hand guns and more. And for some reason the police and Russian army have no idea what is going on or any way of even finding the criminals involved to capture them or the McClane boys. I'm not sure but the moment that much fire power is involved or a fireball lights up the sky you would think that would be a clue as to what is going on.

The biggest problem with the film and after the rest I know this will sound strange, but it doesn't have enough plot. With the exception of John going to save his son we don't get anything else until nearly 50 minutes into the movie. And the plot line we do get feels forced and shoved together, the final twist not even something that comes as a surprise or takes up much story time. The movie is well made but hard to appreciate since most of it is spent either running, driving or flying somewhere in pursuit.

I'm still a Willis fan. I'll still go back and watch the previous films in this series. I was glad that I watched this one as a rental because if I had paid for the DVD I would have been disappointed. As a rental this one can be a good night's entertainment but not one that I'd want to watch over again. If the idea was to spin off of the elder McClane to a new series of films involving his son then they've failed. As a stand alone action flick it's not bad but no better than a number of direct to DVD films that have come out this year.

They completely gave up attempting any kind of story or plot or any of the unique factors that made the Die Hard movies great in the first place.

He wasn't muscle bound or indestructible, he wasn't a specialist in killing, etc.  He was the every man in an extreme situation.  This film took all of that away and left nothing but a guy screaming and pulling a trigger.

If you want a real good story, go see a drama or murder mystery, or one of those movies that the critics all love, but everyone else thinks is boring.

I have read reviews about how the plot was terrible and that the one-liners were awful. I personaly loved the one-liners especially ""I'm on vacation!"", which is said by some to be reundant. I cant imagine why people didn't like the plot or how they can say it was too loose. I was slightly worried about going to see this movie because the more a series of movies progresses, the easier it is for the director and writer to mess it up, plus it had gotten very poor reviews. However, another part of my mind said that it would probobly be better than the reviews had said. I am not usually on the same side of things as critics when it comes to movies. I usually love movies that critics say are terrible, such as Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. Other movies that people tought were akin to the Holy Grail, I thought were terrible.

The worst is the needless idea that there is some spray that will instantly eliminate radiation. I spent 16 years in the military, much of it working in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical defense. There is no such spray. The reason I say this was not needed is the actors were wearing radiation suits. I am sure it was easier to express emotion without the suits but they had already worn protective suits through much of the movie.

The second problem is the way most of the Russians speak English most of the time. It is fine when talking to the Americans but why would they speak English between themselves? It is not like they speak English all the time. They switch back and forth.

In fact I have enjoyed every Die Hard, parts two and four a little less but still found entertainment from them. This one however left me wanting. Sure John McClane has become something of a super hero and is no longer the ""regular cop"" in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"". This began in Live Free or Die Hard. However I still enjoyed that one a lot more then this. The ""main"" villain was forgettable. The action scenes are way too CGI'd. And the ""jokes"" just aren't funny. The story seems to be more about McClane's relationship with his son then about the villains and the danger they pose to the city/world. That's fine except this is a Die Hard movie.

5397955,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"I can't believe that they are making yet another after this!  This movie is one of those movies that you watch and wonder if they filmed it first, then tried to come up with a story!  The main plot to the film seems to have been use the usual action movie cliches such as take a prisoner and be on the run throughout the film, bad guys shoot everything and everyone up but chose to beat up the heroes in order to give them a chance to escape, and lots of shooting and destruction!

This film's main goal reminded me of 'Bad Boys II' in that the story was thrown out of the window in favor of crashing, shooting or blowing up everything in site.  I HATE when film producers do this and think that we should love it because they are destroying luxury vehicles.  In one scene, the armored truck was clearly intentionally destroy every car in it's path for no reason at all except the producer or director thought that it would be exciting.  I swear, whoever made this must have been a rich dude who knows nothing about film-making but wanted to be hands-on to act like he knows.

The dialog and the pace of the film along with it's sleep inducing formula reminded me of 'The Hangover II' and it's lines that the audience assumes to be jokes - but they were not funny one bit and the timing was off!  There was not real relationship between father and son although they superficially tried to establish one, mainly because they felt that they had to.  In this Die Hard film, we do not care about any of the characters and we do not care if John McClean survived or got killed, just as long as the film was done.

There comes a time when artists should know when to end something and when to continue them.  With the Marvel films, they came from comic books with over decades of stories, so they can keep making those.  When it comes to Die Hard, you have to end it when the main character is looking elderly with only the energy of a 35 year old.  The first three Die Hard films were great and classic, but the forth one was fair, and this one deserve a negative one in score.  This is one of those films that should not have been made.  They need to stop it now as the one classic series has gone the way of ""Death Wish,"" ""Friday the 13th"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" with endless sequels, one more foolish than the last.  These are not James Bond films you know.

Bruce Willis has had a string of flops that rank as some of the worst films ever made (""Cop Out"" anyone?), and this Die hard adds to that collection.  This film is a combination of ""I am Legend"" for boredom with no build up or climax, ""Bad Boys II"" for lots of destruction without a plot, and ""The Hangover II"" for it's horrible jokes and horrible sequel.  I just don't understand (besides money grabs) how someone could view this garbage and green light this as a movie maker except in name recognition.  I waited for almost 40 minutes waiting for that 'moment' where I would become interested in the film, but it never came.

Bruce Willis, like Stallone, is too old for this kind of thing.  They should both take cues from Russell Crowe and play more dramatic parts, but still be seen as a tough guy, only without the action.  Willis has done it before, although I am not sure Stallone could pull it off, but these senior citizen action heroes are the joke of Hollywood!  No one wants to see Barnaby Jones be invincible, and we are tired of John McClean always running into trouble and ending up the hero.

The original Die Hard is one of my favorite action flicks of its time when it came out and the sequels including this one have yet to live up to the original. However if you are a fan of the series of movies, you know exactly what you are going to get, over the top action and somewhat unrealistic car chases and shootouts. Going into this knowing that and suspending your belief in reality a bit and you will enjoy this movie for what it is, good popcorn fare. This movie has almost become a parody of the original though and it is a shame they keep repeating a similar plot with each new iteration of the Die Hard series.

My biggest issue with the movie is the script, who is writing these lines?? How many times is McClane gonna say ""Jesus"" and ""I am on vacation"". Those quickly became annoying and detracted from the movie.

Even with that, I did like the movie. It is not going to be a classic by any means but I do wish if Willis is going to do another Die Hard, please please bring in a quality story and some better script writers with something new.",1373068800,,1352,4.357142857142857

Months later I could not help myself from renting it OnDemand one brutally hot July evening, six years and one day after John McClane saved us from traffic jams and the digital draining of US wealth by hackers in an 18-wheeler. I realize this review is not for LFODH, but I want to convey how low my expectations were for AGDTDH. Ninety eight minutes later I sat disgusted with everyone involved in this production, as well as myself for spending any money whatsoever watching this poorly written, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly directed, and poorly conceived heap of glass and helicopter parts.

We all enjoyed the original, landmark ""Die Hard."" We were slightly bemused by the naked karate scene in the otherwise solidly entertaining ""Die Harder,"" and then we were 100 percent back in the game ""With a Vengeance."" Then McClane jumped on an F-35 and had his trademark quip censored, and we all wanted the man to go out with the dignity that he deserved after saving hundreds in LA, thousands in Washington, DC, and all of our money at the New York Federal Reserve. Dignity is not to be had in AGDTDH- not for McClane, his son, or us, the viewers and fans of this once iconic franchise. This movie is absolutely atrocious. Save your money, your time, and your tears. Only John McTiernan could possibly help give McClane one last good outing, but I suspect he would rather stay in prison than be associated with the follow-up to A Good Day to Die Hard, which is a horrible film and the worst Die Hard movie. The only winner is Len Wiseman.",1372982400,,1915,4.648967551622419

5397984,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Not much content in this movie, just a lot of explosions and action.  Bruce Willis is good in it, if you are a Bruce Willis fan, but for my husband and I (who are Bruce Willis fans), the storyline and character building was weak.",1372982400,2,229,4.204545454545454
5397995,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"I'm not sure why this is a Die Hard movie. It was a mediocre action movie that for some inexplicable reason had John McClane in it.

Come on guys, this movie is not that bad. I was not expecting it to be a path-breaker movie or something extraordinary.

I found chase scene including some other high point of this movie.. In fact on bluray it was so good that I watched multiple times.

now what I did not like,  Jai Courtney fails as a son of McClane. He does not look like McClane and there are so many other good actors who can do a better job then him. Now I am not saying he is a bad actor, but not in a single frame he looked like McClane's son. I loved McClane's daughther in Diehard 4, but I am sorry for his son.

The plot was more ""realistic"", but it seems the production value in this movie went to big helicopters and the sets, and quite honestly it wasn't enough. It was definitely action packed, but it wasn't a thrill ride. There just seemed to be action for the sake of action. It was patterned no real flow was established talk, action, talk, action, talk, action, and the transitions sometimes were just so stupid it was insulting.

5398112,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Ok, there may be spoilers in this review.

I have been wanting this movie for a while.  I have the box set of the other movies.  So, I got this.  When I saw it was 90 some minutes.  I told my mom is was going to suck.  I am just going to tell you the bad stuff.  There was nothing good in my opinion.

Ok, while the movie was 90 some minutes, really, it was like 70.  The reason?  he beginning of the movie, there is what I can only guess is a twenty minute car chase.  It just goes on and on and on.  It may be kind of cool at first, but after like 10 minutes is just hits that dull phase.  We actually all started laughing.  You get to see cars flip and fly through the air.  Whatever, it was a waste of time.  This you will find is something that happens many times in the movie.  Your time gets wasted.

Now, the story.  I mean, there was none.  Something about someone stealing nuclear stuff from, ready, Chernobyl.  When I heard them say that I was like OH, MY, GOD.  So I guess these people want to steal nuclear stuff to make a weapon.  Alright, the place they want to get it from is so full of nuclear waste and so dangerous that even if you had the most advanced suit with protection, I do not think you would be able to survive even an hour there.  Yet, these terrorist just walk around.  THEN, and this made us all laugh, the father and son go in, fight and walk around with no protection on.  Just la, la, la, walking around a highly filled nuclear zone with no protection.  It was freaking ridiculous.  That is another thing you will see a lot in the movie.  The freaking father and son CAN NOT die.  I mean, they fall from a building, hit some stuff on the side and just survive.  Once, they are in a building and a helicopter is firing in shots from one of those guns.  I am not sure how many rounds a gun like that shoots off.  But let's just say they would be ripped in half.  But, nope.  They survive.  They have a slow motion scene and you see like 5 bullets coming in the building.  Really?  Five bullets.  Some on.  That entire building would be no more.  One scene, the father jumps from a helicopter, fly's through the air and goes in the side of a building.  Guess what?  He is fine.  I mean, they just make is so damn stupid.  These guys can not die.

Ok, the father and son have something going on.  The son does not like the father because the father worked to much when the kid was young.  Really?  They try to make their scenes funny and witty.  But I assure you, they are neither.  One scene the father is talking to someone about not being there for his son.  I mean, it is the WORST acting I have ever seen.  Like he is reading right from a piece of paper and putting nothing into it.  At the end, the freaking father and son are getting along great.  Again, really?  The father interrupts a mission the son is on.  I guess the father thinks it is fine to just get into a vehicle and start killing people.  Even though he is not even in the U.S. any more.  They kind of ruined the original movies making the son hate the father.  It just makes the originals feel sad.

This movie had so many great actors.  But, the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen.  It was like a cheesy, 70s B movie.  One that you would see at a drive in while high. It really was one of the worst things I have ever seen.  The best part of the movie was the last 20 or 30 minutes.  I think it is because you start to see why some of the stuff is happening.  That or you know the freaking thing is about to end.

I almost feel like this movie was made as a joke.  They said ""hey lets make this movie and make it as stupid and as far from Die Hard as we can.""  I have no clue why they even slapped the Die Hard name onto this movie.  This just I don't know.  Not Die Hard at all.  I actually didn't feel like I had even seen Bruce W. in the movie.  That is how bad the acting was.  Just 90 some minutes of pointless, meaningless dribble.  I can not sell the movie.  Again, I have the others and want this to add into my set.  Plus, I paid like $24 and something for it.  I would only loose money.  Just a bad idea to get this movie all around.",1372377600,,4157,3.9792429792429793

My wife and I were very disappointed in this movie, wanted to shut it off several times and compare all to this one. Such as Was not as bad A Good Day to Die Hard, or he it cannot be as bad as the recent Die Hard..

And every time I wasn't disappointed. That really begins from Die Hard I, where you see at christmas time out of no where, a bunch of terrorists took over Aka??? building ( whatever the name is), it forces John McClain a regular NYPD to deal with it single-handedly.

DH2 Die Harder, John McClain waiting for his wife at the airport, and terrorists took over airport with his wife about a couple of hours before landing.

DH3 with a Vengeance, John McClain became a lousy drunk and got kicked off the unit. Terrorists bombed NY city and request him to come back.

DH4, this is actually pretty loose one for me, his retired and his daughter is captured(? I forgot the plot). But then John still managed to beat the bad guy at this own game at the end.

Now, the common successful element in the past movies is quite obvious - DH always been a movie that is the enemy who bring up John McClain, its always the big bad terrorists were the center of movie.

And it is quite obvious why this movie isn't working because the big bad guy is vague and pretty LAME. The Soviet old guy after reveal himself, he simply have no more input just stand there get caught until his daughter come in rescue what's the thrill to beat a dumb ** like that. And most parts of the movie is simply just about the old guy being trace and while John is tagging along, he somehow missed the injure all, but then he's not pursuing to break the game the Russian is playing.

The whole plot in this movie is just rescuing mission, that is it, while all the other movies were about John breaking at the enemies' game.

Another thing is John McClain was always been a slang cop, this movie really downplay that side of his character. I think Bruce Willis do get aged, but it's the script writers fault to play his character more serious than it should.

I do still hope there will be Die Hard another day

A mere pretext upon which to graft big funny explosions (the courthouse), big funny car chases (wow!: more, wilder, faster, lots of funny collateral damage and destruction...), impressive funny shootouts, but no other bodily harm than flesh wounds by bullets or debris, definitely not grievous. Not even radiation sickness after the funny final battle in Chernobyl's ransacked nuclear plant. So, it's all great fun.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Ask any genre fan what the best action film of all time is, and a fair percentage will say Die Hard without hesitation, me included. Hell, the original trilogy in its entirety blew me away. They consistently offered tactically brilliant villains, and they went to great lengths to ensure they wouldn't be re-treads of the original. Of course, film studios never let a financial opportunity go to waste... leaving tarnished legacies an inevitability. As a result, John McClane returned to the big screen 12 years after the fact in Live Free or Die Hard, but not without its share of controversy. In order to reach a broader audience, the film was edited to acquire a PG-13 rating. Was the outrage that followed justified? Somewhat, but to be fair, it was a decent action-packed effort that featured John McClane kicking ass once again, so I found very little to complain about. Ever since, all of our beloved action stars from the 80's have made a resurgence, so it was only natural for Fox to keep the ball rolling with A Good Day to Die Hard, is a film which promised to introduce our favourite tough-guy to Mother Russia, and with an 18 certificate, which is only right.

A political prisoner is about to blow the whistle on a corrupt Russian official, but the criminal mastermind acts with extreme force to ensure that never comes to pass. It's an intriguing setup that comes with lots of potential, but ultimately serves as a bunch of noise behind the films far more transparent crux where John McClane's estranged son Jack [Jai Courtney] is seemingly at the centre of this mess, so he sucks up his pride and hops on the first plane to Moscow for an awkward heart-to-heart! John may be in a foreign land, but he's made to feel right at home when an attack erupts outside of the courthouse where his son is being held. Barely escaping with their lives, the father and son at odds rip through Moscow in a high speed chase that takes half the city along with it and, the rest of the film practically writes itself. Although the duo start things off on the wrong foot, numerous encounters with bad guys itching to 'die hard' force them to bond in the only way the John McClane's know-how. By kicking ass and blowing up whatever gets in their way.

Sure, it's a great idea to have John McClane team up with his son Jack and all, but at this point it feels like the filmmakers were throwing ideas at the wall, just hoping one would stick. I can understand the Directors primary concern, was to deliver an action film first and foremost. Screenwriter Skip Woods and Director John Moore felt saddling John McClane with a sidekick was obligatory. Die Hard doesn't need a gimmicks, just put our antihero in the right place at the wrong time, and allow him to do what he does best and I felt he did his very best, despite what other reviewers gave it a big thumbs down, especially with their one dimensional views and they should get a life and leave out their negative views, as most reviewers have rubbished this film and they are totally out of order, as I thought it was totally brilliant and awesome at the same time.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Good Day to Die Hard makes this Blu-ray debut with an impressive 1080p brilliant encoded transfer with an impressive aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Attempting to provide a gritty visual aesthetic, especially as this film was shot using 35mm film, meaning there's a noticeable amount of grain without being intrusive enough make the grain haters cry ""foul."" Despite the film's many shortcomings, this does help to lend the latest Die Hard with a tone of intensity, and this encode replicates the intended filmic look flawlessly. There are no digital anomalies to speak, especially of no edge enhancement, banding, aliasing or digital artefacts. The colour palette is somewhat muted at times, but the film is dominantly shown through blue and orange filters, and this artistic choice is also replicated without issue. It's an attempt to keep the film somewhat dark and moody, but it sure does help to make the reds and oranges of countless explosions practically leap off the screen. Sharpness is immaculate, although there are some soft shots inherent to the photography, while black levels and contrast remain strong throughout.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The awesome 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Track packs so much punch, your house will probably join the rubble left behind in Moscow. Immersion might even be an understatement and It doesn't matter if we're listening to cars get crunched off the road, or if we're under an audible barrage of bullets flying in every which direction, because every sound effect has been mixed with pinpoint precision and depth. The film packs quite a punch when things really get rough, but impressive dynamics make every shot, crunch, punch and explosion that much more impressive. Dialogue is crystal clear, and environmental ambience is so real, you'll practically feel like you're standing right next to John McClane and son while they're kicking ass. If you want a new action flick to show off your home theatre equipment, you're going to want to give this Blu-ray disc a spin.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director John Moore and First Assistant Director Mark Cotone: Director John Moore has a decent enough chat with first-assistant director Mark Cotone about the production and making a film to an already established franchise. There's nothing particularly noteworthy in their conversation, but the two provide a nice account of their experience with good technical details. The commentary track is only available on the extended cut of the film.

Special Feature: Making It Hard To Die [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [60:00] A 15 part making-of style documentary that exhaustively details the production values, from conception to the final post-production touches. With several interviews of cast and crew, the doc shares a variety of worthwhile information about the stunts, special effects, shooting location and the camerawork.

Special Feature: Anatomy of a Car Chase [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [26:00] A detailed look at the amazing car chase through the Moscow streets with interviews that explain the amount of work, planning and preparation done for this one action sequence while keeping CGI to a minimal.

Special Feature: Two of a Kind [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [8:00] A few minutes on the plot of father and son relationship with a variety of comments.

Special Feature: Back in Action [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [7:00] Spotlight moves to Bruce Willis and his reprisal of the John McClane character. It's interesting to give a brief look at how Bruce Willis is still able to step in the character's shoes, especially after all these years.

Special Feature: The New Face of Evil [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [7:00] This third promotional documentary in a row, here we get to learn about the three villains.

Special Feature: Pre-Vis [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [12:00] Some CGI animatic for some of the film's more demanding sequences. The most interesting thing is watching what could have been, as some of the ""footage"" is for a scene that never made it into the film.

Special Feature: VFX Sequences [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:00] A collection of 16 action sequences demonstrating the CGI work done.

Special Feature: Maximum McClane [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [3:00] A very amusing montage, showing the best moments from all of the 'Die Hard' films.

Still Gallery [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] Two sections are devoted to an assortment of ""Storyboards"" and ""Concept Art Gallery.""

Deleted Scenes [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [14:00] It is understandable why most of these scenes were cut. They really would have thrown the 'wham, bam, thank you mam' pace off kilter. The filmmakers were wise to make the choices they did, and there wasn't anything I found myself wishing was in the final product.

Original Theatrical Trailers [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1]  [3:30]

Finally, coming after the well-received `Live Free or Die Hard' and `A Good Day to Die Hard,' but here we have a totally brilliant action packed film from start to finish and will have you breathless by the time the film credits appear on the screen. There are some totally awesome cool car chases and especially the shoot-em-up sequences, as well as an abundance of high energy in delivering the action where it needs to be. `A Good Day to Die Hard' is totally entertaining; and it makes me so angry why most pompous critics have panned this film in such a horrible nasty way and they should keep their negative thoughts to themselves. On top of that, 20th Century Fox has put together a fantastic Blu-ray release, with an hour-long making-of documentary, a great audio commentary, and several other documentaries, which I think is a total bonus and why you should purchase this amazing Blu-ray disc package and then it will complete your Die Hard Collection. I totally dispute all the negative reviews I have read and obviously these idiots have been watching a totally different film to me and obviously I must be a lone wolf when it comes to reviewing a film and knowing everyone else is totally wrong in their negative attitude and views. So as far as I am concerned this gets a 10 star rating and I am totally proud to add this to my Die Hard Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Oh sure, the special effects, explosions, hundreds of wrecked cars, innocent lives taken during the mayhem chase I guess is what excites the emotions in this one.

There's nothing original about the story line, other than John's son is now introduced into the heroics of saving the world...well, their little corner of the world, anyway.  ***Yawn!***

No character development or point to the story, they introduce characters that seem to be significant but you have no idea why probably due to over editing.  I guess you could say the point of the story was to have the son call him John and then have one break through moment where he calls him Dad.  There that's the whole movie.

I cannot tell you how disappointed we both were, but especially my husband.  This ""Die Hard"" should be in a category by itself, it's sooooo awful.  You sort of know it's gonna be bad, right at the beginning, with terrible graphics.  Then, there's no plot to speak of, which really screws up the whole movie.  We're not talking about award winning plots, here; when we say ""plot"" we mean even the faintest semblance of a plot, just to hold the thing together....just to give you some structure to relate to.  As a result, this terrible movie is just one long chase scene after another for the whole time (where you don't know why they're doing this or where they're going, or where this is all leading to)......plus the camera work is very bad, the lighting is bad, all of the acting is bad, no directing to speak of.  Bruce Willis must have needed the money, to agree to appear in such a piece of junk.

My husband finally could not stand it and we turned it off and threw it out.  We haven't seen such a 100% waste of time and money.  Even if you love Bruce Willis, you will not love this.

This movie looked promising to me because I also like films with Russian characters so this should have been great. But, while there were some good points and the requisite cool explosions, the film fell flat overall. I could pick out several instances where a scene could have been a lot better with just a few more lines of dialogue or a little extra effort to maintain consistency with characters. Why no backstory as to how Jack and his father fell out? Why did no one in the family know Jack's career path for several years? When everyone started speaking English in front of Komarov, how did we know that Komarov understood them? And how on earth did they get to their final location (no spoilers) without being stopped by guards? (And they completely downplayed the future health effects they will likely suffer because of that trip.)

This film made some leaps and assumptions that were hard for me to overlook since I specifically paid attention to the Russian elements and have basic geographical, cultural, and linguistic knowledge. But it wasn't terrible.",1371686400,,1143,4.743718592964824

I don't have the time to touch on the many instances of nonsense, so you'll just have to see for yourself.

There are so many flubs, continuity problems, poor filmmaking, terrible script, and Willis obviously showed up just for the paycheck on this one - which is too bad after the surprisingly good ""Live Free or Die Hard"" - that it's an unforgivable mess that feels like a Hungarian film unrelated to the John McClane character, ""featuring"" Bruce Willis.

5398566,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

As a huge fan of the Die Hard franchise I made many attempts to see the fifth installment, A Good Day To Die Hard, when it was in theaters. However, the plans always fell through. As the credits began to roll at the end of the movie I started to think that maybe it was a sign. As I sat on my couch I couldn't help but wonder what went wrong. Surely I must have missed something during the past 90 minutes. It couldn't have been that bad, could it? As I laid in bed I told myself I had to re-watch it because I missed something. That was the only explanation. Sadly, nothing changed even after I sat through it a second time.

It would be hard for me to summarize the plot because, truthfully, it's all over the place. One thing the Die Hard franchise has always done well is provide the viewer with an interesting antagonist. Not only that, but they always made it a point to say ""This man right here. Hey! He's the villain. He's why McClane is doing this."" That's not the case with this movie. Instead, we get ""He's the villain. Nope, psych it's this guy. Wait, nope we changed our mind again. It's this guy now. Oh, remember how we spent the first 70 minutes talking about this? Well, that's not really what this movie's about. Hope you don't mind."" There's no direction, there's no banter between John and a main villain, there's nothing. The entire thing feels sloppily put together and, at times, amateurish.

Then comes the pacing. It doesn't take long before we get the first big explosion and the movie doesn't let up until the credits start rolling. There's one over-the-top scene after the next and that's not what the Die Hard series is about. Yes, there's always been those larger-than-life moments, but they were always spaced out and they looked somewhat realistic. Every big scene in here just feels so fake and fabricated that the would-be ""Wow"" moments turn into grunts of disgust. For example, within the first 20 minutes or so John gets shot at with an RPG while driving a would-be 18 wheeler if it was carrying a shipment. So in an effort to avoid the missile he somehow spins the truck in a full circle while the missile flies past. Less than three minutes later we have John in a Mercedes vehicle driving on top of a bunch of cars trying to get on the freeway. It was just so... corny.

I haven't even mentioned the final scene yet. I kind of think their budget was running out because the further I got into the film the worse the presentation got. The guns looked like they weren't even shooting anymore and the big finale looked like a CGI sequence from a PS2 game. The cheesiness was so bad that it rivaled the cheesy moments from the first film. With that said, I think the director attempted to have a throwback moment to the film that started it all. There's a segment where you see Yuri Kamarov (Sebastian Koch) falling from a skyscraper and it greatly resembles the scene from the original where Hans was falling out of the window. Also, some of the compositions, provided by Marco Beltrami, resembled some of the compositions from the first film. Unfortunately, that's where the enjoyment stops with the score because the rest of the compositions are all generic pieces we've heard dozens of times before in other action films.

As if all that wasn't bad enough, we're given Jack (Jai Courtney) and boy I haven't hated a character in a movie this much in a long time. All this man does is whine and complain. They tried to portray him as this strong male who (sort of) did good things for himself even though his father wasn't there in his life, but I couldn't help but think that he was just this huge brat with daddy issues. If your dad is John McClane you have no right to complain! That's just a law. He's out there saving lives and being a badass and you're mad because he wasn't home to have dinner with you? Come on. I mean even Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) didn't complain this much in Live Free or Die Hard and she at least had some personality. Jack is just awful.

Finally, we all love John McClane. There's no question that he's become a household name amongst film enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it feels like his character got put on the back-burner in an effort to showcase Jack. Gone are the witty one-liners, gone are the crazy fistfights, gone is the near-constant connection with the villain. Hell, even his infamous ""Yippie-Kay-Yay"" line felt misplaced when he used it. They tried to throw in a joke or two, but none of it really made me laugh as I was only able to muster a pathetic chuckle at times. This was like the final nail in the coffin for me. This one missing element is what really makes this movie not feel like a Die Hard film. If you don't have the right portrayal of John McClane then all you have is Bruce Willis in another generic action flick.

Standout Score: 5/10 - Coming from someone who was never fond of Die Harder, A Good Day To Die Hard is by far the worst entry in the series. Not only is the plot terribly boring, the movie itself lacks in the comedy department and it suffers from some extremely poor pacing. It feels like they're trying to do away with John to try and make room for Jack and I hope that's not the case. Jack lacks the spark that makes John so fun to watch and I can't see him carrying an entire film on his own. I'm not sure what John Moore was thinking with this, but if they plan on making a sixth movie I really hope he's not in charge again.",1371168000,,5495,4.418558736426456

What they hadn't considered was that Bruce Willis has enough charisma to carry it off, as evidenced by the last film in the franchise. Once they finally get started there is a car chase that feels as if it will never end. This nightmare of a sequence really seemed to be aimed at, ""John McClain can still drive a car even if he can't dangle from skyscrapers"".
The other side of this was the break with the ""hook"" of the Die Hard series of McClain being a reluctant hero. He is a man forced into doing things he really doesn't want to do. Here they actually say ""The family business is killing bad guys"". They come off like Dexter without the sense of humor.
From top to bottom this film was a failure and was just a transparent rip off, trying to grab at the consumers cash by offering up substandard fair with an established product.

5398655,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Ive loved pretty much all the Die Hard movies. The original I saw in the theaters years and years ago and was blown away by it! Hands down one of the top 5 action movies of all time. Bruce Willis was amazing in it. Funny and bad ass all at the same time. Die Hard 2 I liked at the time. I was young and impressionable but in the series of Die Hard films not very strong. I think it wasn't so great was there were too many bad guys and not a really centralized one and the supporting cast was so-so. Die Hard with a Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard were both really good. Sam Jackson and Bruce Willis were very good counterparts. It got a little ""yelly"" at times, in fact most of the dialogue was yelled but the plot was decent, they didn't use much GCI and overall was 2nd in my most favorite Die Hard films. Live free or die hard was good because of Justin Long. Most people kind of pan him as an actor but he was very believable as a techie and he was also a great counterpart to Bruce Willis. Timothy Olyphant played a surprising good bad guy. His dry sense of humor and scow ell made me feel at least that getting on his bad side wasn't a great idea. He did die in a creative way that I even wince a little bit when I have seen this movie on cable.

This latest Die Hard doesnt even belong in the pantheon of Die Hard movies. Bruce Willis looks tired and bored in this movie. It kind of has a plot but not really. You can see the action before it happens and want to yell at the actors to move but as we all know that's pretty pointless. Apparently John McClaine and his son John McClaine in this one are made of Teflon and are scratch proof. Remember in the original when he cuts his feet on the glass and he has to pull the glass out and wrap his feet in paper towels and they really made the audience feel it? In this one they are jumping out of building, through windows and other crap and barely a scratch on them. I also never really believed the bad guys were going to get away with their ruse like I did in the other Die Hards. Suspension of disbelief doesnt even qualify here it's so bad.

Gone With the Wind is a masterpiece of a movie, but to me it was boring---it's just not my type of movie. Well, A Good Day to Die Hard is a GREAT action movie and nothing else!!! It's not philosophical, it's not dramatic, it does not have a deep plot, and it may not even make sense. That's okay. But it's FUN !!  Lots of incredible action, gun-fire, car-chases, crashes. It's hard to catch all the details. The plot, as others have opined, is thin, but it keeps the story moving so that the directors can insert more action sequences. Acting is good, too, even though it is mostly (surprise!) of the macho-guy type. A few comical moments are interspersed here and there to add variety.

No I won't swear but I swear that the director has no idea how to handle this type of film.

no its not going to be a good movie for some people, but as a dick flick it works, its entertaining.

I leave the rest of the stuff to the critics.

I guess if you don't like die hard then don't watch them, but if you do you'll be happy with this one.

Die Hard 4 is the best so far
Die hard 1 is classic
Die hard 3 & 5 are next

My wife and I are huge Die Hard fans and 1 thru 4 were all good films.

#5 a good day to die hard left us disappointed with the total lack of the typical die hard film. Their was so much potential to this film and it was never pursued. The plot was as if someone who had never been involved in the franchise wrote it. The producers and the director left too many holes and never developed each scenario into a more intricate challenge that could have elevated the film. What you saw in the previews of the film were never used. Everytime we expected a die hard moment it turned out totally flat. It appears they made this film to just try and make money and never took it seriously enough to make it entertaining

We know it is a Die Hard film
We know that everywhere John goes huge messes end up happening
We also know the deeper he gets the more the bad guys want to kill him

5398731,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Where do I begin? I love foreign languages, and I want to speak Russian someday, but when I'm relaxing, (1) I don't want to have to read subtitles. (2) The subtitles went too fast, and I consider myself both literate and a speed reader. (3) It was frustrating when the Russians were speaking English because whenever I let my guard down (laid down), I had to sit up and read more subtitles. Pick a language! Realistically most Europeans nowadays speak English so it wouldn't have been a stretch for the Russians to speak English throughout the movie.

(4) Did the producers get a subsidy for filming in Russia? It's great to have most of the movie take place in Russia, but could we see more of Russia versus only the destruction of property? The director could have made his point without having a 30 minute (?) worth of scenes trampling over people and cars. Really, is that what you want us to take away from voyeuristically being in Russia? That Russian people are to be trampled all over without regard or consequence for their safety. I did NOT like the subliminal messages from this movie at all.

(5) Did the producers get a kickback for using Mercedes? For a person who likes Mercedes to see Mercedes after Mercedes destroyed was sickening! How about donate a car or two to a charity? I didn't count the number of cars, including Mercedes, destroyed, but it had to be in the hundreds if not thousands. Ridiculous! The $100 million dollar budget went mostly to the destruction of property.

(5) Jack was so disrespectful towards his father. What messages are we sending to others? That Americans don't know how to treat their elders with respect?

(6) At least with ""Fast and Furious"" movies there's a believable plot and believable elements. You're surrounded by ******SPOILER ALERT******

radiation and you don't get sick? PLA - LEASSSSE! So the producer(s) got a subsidy (guessing and speculation) for filming in Russia. Really? The script writer couldn't think of anything better than uranium coming out of Chernobyl and double cross upon double cross?

(7) We, the viewing audience, purposefully selected the extended cut - it only contained two minutes at most (guessing). The total movie was 97 minutes. If I had seen this in theaters, I most likely would have demanded my money back. It was too short and when it ended, there wasn't closure. There were too many lose ends. So the CIA doesn't have anything to say about the discovery of uranium? There could have been more finesse.

(8) I have to credit/blame the director for this movie being a flop despite bringing in $300 million. I hope the next movie isn't directed by whoever this director was (I can't remember), but you can tell that this is another movie entirely. Where's the original director????

I had high hopes for this movie. If the director is directing the next one, I will not be patronizing this franchise any more. With the addition of Jack, I could have seen this movie living on, but now, I'm not quite so sure.

You can see the camera sway from side to side and in my opinion it really takes away from the shot when you can see the camera sway.

The plot was weak but I still enjoyed the movie.  it is an action film and that means that its about the explosions and noise which ther eis plenty of.  The script is a little cheesy with a punch line delivered and then used a few scenes later and again later.....such as ""I'm on vacation.""

5398786,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"First,

  I was a big fan of this ""franchise"", hate that word, because to me it's an excuse to think of a thing as a product in a box, instant macaroni and cheese.  Which unfortunately is exactly what this has become.

  The last one wasn't terrible and followed the ""recipe"" of the ""franchise"".

  This one smacks of them trying to set up the new kid John McLane (sp?) JR to take over the franchise and it was a lot like they had Bruce Willis around to provide a touch point / seasoning to help loft the kid into his shoes.  Willis was there, had a goodly amount of screen time and they tried to palm it off as a ""buddy film"" of sorts between him and his son.  Unfortunately I found myself rooting for the bad guy to finish the kid off.....

  Specifics;

  - Okay, grown son, never mentioned in ANY of the previous movies

  - Russia (who cares, really, and it didn't help that they used extra
  small fonts with serifs for the obnoxious sub-titling for everyone
  who spoke Russian.  It's in Russia, I got it, I really don't want
  to read sub-titles on a movie like this.  I'll save that for Truffaut,
  Fellini, that sort of thing.

  - Plot... Well, there were some things in it that would I guess surprise
  someone who hadn't seen contrived TV plots over the last 20 some odd years.
  What were supposed to be great plot twists were somewhat obvious as
  you knew that if they didn't flip the plot, the movie would be over WAY
  too soon.

  - Chase scenes through Russia...  Well, at least one truck gets hijacked
  in short order and mayhem ensues, guess they couldn't afford to hire
  Russian police to really get into the chase.

  - Major demolition, same deal, in town and in other locations, explosions
  just this side of a mushroom cloud and it's treated like a normal day
  in downtown Moscow.

  Lacking

  -  Good dialogue, ""The McLane family business is Killing bad guys...."",
  that sort of thing.  Meant to be inspiring I suppose, came across as
  mostly trite.

  -  All of the previous entries had Mclane interacting with at least one
  bad guy, verbal barbs, etc.  Really none of that.

  -  Okay, Sr and Jr should be able to pick up some of the slack?  Nope,
  not that I heard anyway.

  -  Action sequences, meh, actually boring except for some really
  decent explosions.

  -  I found myself rooting for the villain's helicopter, but I think
  they even swapped it out for a different model later in the movie;
  My Heli had stub wings with missiles, last one, didn't see any of that.

  -  Willis did seem like he was on vacation, standing around lackluster
  performance. (but I think a lot of that is he wasn't
  given all that much to work with.).

  Predictable

  -  Son won't call Dad, Dad, guess what happens towards the end
  (oops, hope I didn't spoil it.)

  -  Daughter from previous movie brought in for all of about a minute

  -  Family portrait against a sunset sort of thing towards the end
  of the movie.

  Good news

  I only  rented it, and not in HD, so the loss wasn't all that much.

  Recommendation

  Even for completists (me, for example) You'll never get this time back, go read a good book, I can
  recommend some.

  Hopefully, if there's a next one, it will be better, but I'm guessing that the ""kid"" will try and take the
  spotlight (Remember Bonnie Bedalia (sp?), Willis wife? They dumped her off the truck very quickly.

  Stick with the first few of the series, pretend like this one didn't happen.

  I suppose on some level, if I hadn't enjoyed the other episodes as much, I wouldn't be as down on
  this one.  By itself, it's likely a decent enough action flick.

It was obvious that Bruce Willis really had no interest in this movie and was doing it for the money. The story line is bad, the acting is bad, most of the action is bad, the villains are bad. This movie was made to use the success of the previous Die Hard movies and make a few bucks on as low a budget as possible. The movie is dark, I expect it was done that way so you don't see the backgrounds or something.

Its not a bad movie, but it didn't feel the same anymore. Some people might say its because of Bruce Willis age, but he did pretty well and I don't feel like that hurt the movie. I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that said the acting was off a bit. All the Die Hard's have a little bit of comedy and one liners from Bruce Willis, but it just didn't work in this one. I was seriously sick of hearing him say he was on vacation. I also don't feel like Bruce sharing equal screen time with his ""son"" really worked. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson in Die Hard 3 worked. This was just a pale shadow of what we saw there. Whats missing most to me though is the bad guy. The first three movies had memorable characters that you really wanted to see dead, while this movies bad guys were very bland and I didn't really care what happened to them.

A Good Day to Die Hard has some great action sequences. Its also great to see Bruce Willis playing this character again. The movie is enjoyable to rent if you are looking for some fun, but there does seem to be a few holes in the acting, the jokes fall a bit flat, the story involving his son really leaves something to be desired, and the bad guys just really make you feel indifferent when you should want to see Bruce take them out by the end of the movie.",1370563200,3,1472,4.201413427561837

5398832,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"A Good Day To Die Hard, despite it's flaws, is not only a good movie but a good die hard movie. I don't understand the hate it gets. What really perplexes me is when people compare it to Olympus Has Fallen. I see so many claiming that Olympus has fallen is more Die Hard than this film. That is so untrue. Die Hard films are nowhere near as melodramatic and patriotic as Olympus. Don't get me wrong, Olympus is a good movie, but for different reasons. I think people's memories of the original 3 are a little skewed to be honest. As for being the most unrealistic in the series, Live Free is still #1 when it comes to being unrealistic. All 5 are.

John McClane is still John McClane. He isn't in his mid 30s anymore. He's over 55 and his whole outlook on life is different now. He's not going act as he did more than 20 years ago, though parts of his old personality still shine through. Jack McClane is very much like a young John. Not quite hardened by experience, yet. Years of fighting trained professional terrorists will change you; another unrealistic aspect of the series. A Good Day has enough in it to keep anyone with realistic expectations glued to their seats. Lots of twists you don't see coming. The plot is pretty straight forward like the other 4 Die Hards. This time John McClane has to stop some russians from obtaining some items that, in their hands, will likely start a third World War. Another complaint people make about the film was the way it was shot. The shaky cam and slow motion isn't new to the Die Hard series, but it is a bit excessive here. I did like the look of the film, though. Looks especially good on bluray. The picture is colorful, grainy, sharp and gives A Good Day a really gritty look. This wasn't filmed in the traditional anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the series. Those films had a lot of steady shots and stylized angles. Live Free was shot on Super 35 and cropped to 2.35:1.

*SPOILERS* The ending could've been better; it was a little abrupt. They just killed the bad guys and walked away. I would've liked to see Holly greet John and Jack when they returned home. With the Extended Cut (101 minutes), they made some improvements. They completely cut out Lucy McClane and put in extra footage that helped expand on John and Jacks relationship. This is very much a father and son movie and this extended cut does strengthen the film.

So going into this for the 1st time, I did expect it to be much better than it was, but it was still a good movie. It entertained me, the story intrigued me and I cared about the characters. Those are the elements that make a movie good.",1370563200,,2626,4.410309278350516

5398835,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"I love the DIE HARD series. It has been one of the most consistent as far as entertainment and quality goes. Perhaps in the action genre,only the Lethal Weapon films can also stake tat claim. But unfortunately, the 5th time around is not the charm for John McClane. The story concerns McClane going to Russia,to offer support for his son-in prison and wrapped up in a high profile trial of a Russian national. The father/son pair meet up and butt heads as they try to outrun the terrorists pursuing the trio,and get to safety.

SO...the good?
*It has all the action you'd want/expect from a DIE HARD film.
*Marco Beltrami also seems to be more comfortable in doing an action score that fits this franchise,and while i would have liked more of Michael Kamens themes-i cant really complain.
*A new location. They don't over-do it and slam a sign that says 'Were in Russio,heres a landmark!"" in your face so,while the film takes place outside the US,the subtle presentation lets you enjoy it or ignore it,depending which you prefer.

Ah...the bad:
*The runtime. The film is barely an hour and 40 minutes long-at least 20 minutes shorter than it should be. Why the rush? It feels as though there was a whole other part to the movie that got scrapped...
*Where are the police? We hear a siren and see a cruiser fly by,and that is enough for the film-makers i guess.
*No fights? A few fists get thrown,but come on-wheres the down and dirty battle? Take the fight with Karl in DIE HARD, or the fight with Maggie Q's character in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Even if John Sr is too old for karate-chopping,let the son pick up the slack...thats what he's there for right?
*John Jr/Jack...yes,he's presented as the lead and John is the sidekick...maybe its just because that fits the story more. Blehh
*Scenes in the trailer that didn't make the cut (ohh..more half-naked biker chick..sigh)

How it could have been better: You could solve 2 problems in one fell swoop. If they had introduced a Russian detective,who was following the Terrorists and McClane duo..youd have
*a longer runtime
*an opportunity for a few quite moments,that weren't a sappy/macho blend,and could help give the audience a better look at the 'characters'
*a simply more rounded,grounded film

Im not saying it would have been the best of the series,but it of been better received if it was at least the quality of DIE HARD 2

so its not as awful as some reviewers claim,and as an action movie its just fine...a decent mindless extravaganza of violence. But as a film with the banner Die Hard...it misses a bit. If the film-makers had a checklist of what makes it a John McClane adventure,they checked off most of it.
So is it the weakest of the series,yes. Is it the 'Leonard Part 6"" of action movies..no. You'll enjoy it if you really like the first 4,you just might find yourself upset that they made no more effort than the checklist.",1370563200,,2896,4.659491193737769

5398837,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"That's the best way to sum up this movie, which is a shame because the premise of McClane going to Russia to help his estranged son is a good one. Unfortunately, that's about as much plot devoted to this emotional arc. McClane and McClane Jr. have zero chemistry and don't seem much different by the movie's climax. It's like the only reason they've reconciled is because it's the end of the movie. If there was no son, McClane could've been on vacation in Russia and the movie would play out, more or less, the same.

This also doesn't feel like a Die Hard movie at all. To me, it's always been about a larger than life villain, the police can't handle, against McClane, who only has his wits and a few measly weapons to fight with. And despite this, he outsmarts and kicks their asses. This villain is easily the weakest of the series and if the police were anywhere in sight, McClane could've told them who to look for and let them take care of it. McClane doesn't need his wits for this villain. He just fires HUGE weapons and throws whatever vehicles are handy at the bad guys. And no matter what happens to McClane, he gets right back up with barely a scratch on him. He's more like a Terminator than John McClane.

The action was spectacular to watch, but without any stakes or an emotional investment in the characters, it's a letdown. Hopefully the next one will be better so the series can go out on a high note.",1370476800,2,1422,4.403041825095057

5398842,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"In 1979 Roderick Thorp wrote the bestselling novel, Nothing Lasts Forever, likely little knowing that his created strange iconoclastic hero John McClane would be such a long running success of a series of films: since the first film version DIE HARD was created in 1988 there have been five films that sustain audience interest in this wildly unimaginable character - Die Hard, Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Live Free or Die Hard, and now A Good Day to Die Hard. Thorp is still given credit in the titles of the characters despite the fact that he died in 1999. But Bruce Willis lives on and in the current version he encounters his son (played by the very talented and hunky Jai Courtney) and the action is doubled.

John Mclane (Bruce Willis, aging well) has been a New York City and a Los Angeles cop who somehow always has explosions in the air and on the ground in every undertaking. But now, the take-no-prisoners cop, for the first time, finds himself on foreign soil after traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son Jack (Jai Courtney) - unaware that Jack is really a highly-trained CIA operative out to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McClanes discover that their opposing methods make them unstoppable heroes.

The cast tosses in bit parts by Sebastian Koch and Yuliya Snigir as the father daughter Russians with a secret, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter, Amaury Nolasco, Cole Hauser as the CIA good guys, Rasha Bukvic, Sergei Kolesnikov, Roman Lukn&aacute;r as the Russian bad guys, and particularly funny Pasha D. Lychnikoff as a singing Cabbie.

As directed by John Moore with a minimal script by Skip Woods this is a very noisy, megalomaniacal destruction derby of cars absurd and annoying to the max!), fire explosion mess of a film, but then it IS a Die Hard genre piece and the interplay between Willis and Courtney make it fun to observe how close to the tree the apple falls! Rasty, nasty action film for those who love them. And it looks like Australian actor Jai Courtney is on the rise.  Grady Harp, June 13",1370476800,,2132,4.7077747989276135

There seems to be static even in the close ups of just faces.  It's a little annoying.  Some scenes are crystal clear and perfect, but then you get more graininess a scene or two later.  It's really odd for a Blu-ray of a movie this new to look like this.  (Sometimes older movies look grainy when converted, but that's because of their age. - Newer movies, like say The Last Stand, look flawless.)  I figured it might just be the movie itself, so I popped in the DVD too.  It actually looks better!  The graininess is less apparent. I didn't watch the whole movie again, but I flipped around a bit. I even compared the scene of John and his daughter from the Theatrical Cut. There is sort of a staticiness around her cheaks that is less so on the DVD.  Did I just get a bad Blu-ray disc or is the DVD superior?  I should note that I watched both of these on the same TV and on the same Blu-ray player.  What's the deal?

The choices the characters made were ludicrous beyond any fathoming, much different than action film destruction suspension of disbelief.
The worst part was being asked to make the same agreement as in the fourth movie, to accept McClain as a serious action hero versus a dumb guy caught in bad situation hero.

5398895,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"""Do you look for trouble to get into?  Or does it just find you?""

If you weren't a fan of the series up to this point, don't bother.  If you have the attention span of a goldfish and can't stop texting long enough to actually pay attention, don't bother.  If you actually think ""reality TV"" is real... never mind.

As deep as you want to look there is something to find in this film.

Action junkies who live for the thrill of explosions and gunfire will see it.  There is the obligatory femme fatale eye candy, although the trailer showed more skin than the actual film.  There is an underlying message that success lies in getting up off the ground when you take the punch.  And there is a prodigal son motif.  IF, that is, you care to actually stop, look, and listen.

Any story, though, contains an implicit contract.  The listener agrees to a suspension of disbelief as long as the teller doesn't push it too far.  The story teller agrees to push right to the line of that disbelief but not cross it.

Usually follow up films will cross that line.  And the more films in the family, the more likely the line will be crossed.

I will be the first to admit that somewhere around the third film, I fell into the category of ""how much crap can happen to one guy?""  I felt that the envelope had been pushed too far.

However, as usual, when the ""critics"" said it was bad, I said, ""well, then I'll probably like it"".  And, I'm glad I did.

This film succeeds.  It presses against the boundary of ""no it didn't"" without quite crossing it.  You didn't really expect an orange to fall from an apple tree did you?

5398899,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"John McClane is in Russia.  Why, you might be asking?  Because his son has been convicted of murder.  Except, really, McClane Jr. is a secret agent, and he's trying to stop a bunch of political terrorists from gathering a whole lot of--you guessed it!--nuclear weaponry.  And of course, when Daddy finds out, he's gotta show his kid how they do it in Dixie.  Er, New York.

Bruce Willis is back, of course.  He looks and feels tired, but he's still fun to watch; the guy's still got acting and action chops, even if both are rather lacking here.  Jai Courtney, who gave a great villainous turn in 2012's JACK REACHER, doesn't have much to do here; his character is by-the-numbers, and takes a back seat to daddy.

Yet, the surprising thing here is that even Willis seems to be a supporting character in his own film.  The outlandish script and over-the-top (in a bad way) action stunts hog too much of the spotlight.  Even Rasha Buckvic, giving us a love-to-hate villain, finds his character undercut in the inevitable third-act twist (which you can see coming, and is not at all satisfying when it arrives, except for the solid performance of Sebastian Koch).  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD feels like an ordinary, direct-to-DVD action film that some producer got ahold of and said, ""Hey, I want to make a DIE HARD sequel, let's squeeze John McClane into this.""

5398924,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"I sure am glad about two things. Firstly that I read a lot of reviews saying this movie is terrible, and secondly knowing that most of the time public reviews are often extremely harsh and not always fair, I'm glad I didn't listen to these people. Here, netflix, IMDB 75-90% of the reviewers either didn't like or downright hated this movie. And I read dozens at each web site. I expected this movie based on all that to be a total bomb. Truth is it's not bad at all. Certainly better than the second installment. In my opinion it's not as good as 1,3 and 4. But better than 2, which I simply thought was not very good at all. People complained that Russia is not a good setting for a Die Hard movie. well I can say it's a lot better than an entire Die hard movie set at an Airport. And in this installment the action is much better than it was in 2.

Many of the reviews were not only too harsh but they were also totally incorrect sometimes. For instance numerous reviews complained that Willi's McClane doesn't hardly say a thing through nearly the entire movie. Totally false. He talks through most of the film only a little less than would be expected. Another is people complaining that the chase scene was 20,30 minutes long. Well it was actually about 3 or 4 minutes longer than the usual classic chase scenes we like to reference. But that doesn't matter and shouldn't. The action and destruction that takes place during this scene is some of the best I have ever seen. More cars are destroyed in this segment than have probably ever been destroyed in any other chase scene in movie history, but they are also destroyed in unique ways and it's visually realistic and extremely impressive. What's the main thing people expect from a Die Hard movie? Lots of mind blowing action that doesn't let you down. This chase as well as all the action in the movie doesn't dissapoint, it's done superbly. Some action moments are pretty hair raising and very stylishly done.

What doesn't work in the movie well is the chemistry between McClane and his son. It's just lazy chemistry with no real heart. They are not given much as far as a script goes to work with either. Comparing it to the script and Chemistry Wills had with Sam Jackson or Justin Long in 3 and 4, it's pretty lackluster, downright terrible in comparison. There is also a lot less humor than we've come to expect and that is a let down too. The bad guys in this outing do not standout like Hans or Peter Gruber did, and there's no hot ass kicking asian girl in this one either. The movie is also not as lengthy as the other Die Hard movies. It's about 15 minutes shorter, so I understand the various reviews where people felt it could have been longer. And Willis often becoming sort of a backup man for his son seems a bit unflattering too. One of the things that we love about John McClane is that he takes control of the situation even if most of the time he feels ""This a bad idea"".

So if there is a lot that just doesn't work well about this movie, then why 4 stars? Well that was a tough choice, but considering how far downhill the movie industry has drifted in the last 10 or so years, I've seen so many movies as of late that are just plain terrible or such letdowns when they promised to be great that I expected this to be even worse than those. I mean based on all the bad reviews I expected an absolute total bomb. This film is far from that. Since Hair raising action is the main reason I go see a Die Hard movie, on that level this movie delivers the goods. Very happy Willis is still willing to play in another sequel, so that's a lot better than no Die Hard to go and see. Sure the plot, script and other various things about this film seem kind of dull and feel kind of flat, but it's still a very entertaining movie, and though it's nowhere as good as the last installment I still really enjoyed it, and much more than Die Hard II.

Still there's a lot to like about this movie. The setting of Russia as a backdrop is really very nice. It's used well, particularly arial shots make the city interesting. Lots of great moments, the plot and story are still interesting, and the movie has a lot to like about it. I think too many people expect each Die Hard movie to outdo the one before it. That was true of 3 and 4 after all, but then not true of I and II. I recommend it as long as your expectations are not set too high, you should really enjoy it. Certainly better than the 'Taken' films. More intelligent and better action. If you loved the two Taken movies, you should love this.",1370044800,48,4569,4.309302325581395

It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I can't even quite explain it but many aspects of a normal Die Hard movie were all missing. I think the terrible writing and story played a major role into ruining this movie sadly :(

I really wanted to like this movie and I didn't believe all the other bad reviews since I had loved all the other Die Hard movies but don't even waste your time with this one. It is nothing like the other Die Hard movies!",1369785600,3,598,3.861788617886179
5398949,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"The following are the highlights of the major differences between the Extended Cut and the Theatrical Cut.  The Extended Cut runs approximately 4 minutes longer and does NOT add any significantly new scenes.  Action scenes remain the same, gore remains the same, and the previously filmed fight scene in front of parked SUVs has not been re-inserted either.

SPOILERS FOLLOW BELOW

1) McClane shoots at the paper target at the police shooting range a little longer, while cursing his son.

2) All scenes involving Lucy McClane have been excised.  So no more beginning scene of Lucy driving John to the airport or meeting her dad and brother at the end of the movie.

3) A few extra scenes of John walking through the demonstration at Moscow.

4) The highway chase scene is a little better cut.

5) A few new quick shots of the assault on the CIA safehouse.

6) A few new quick shots of Irina and the ballroom gunfight.  Slightly clearer how Jack is able to retrieve his gun-knife.

7) There is now a dead body in the trunk of the car that Jack steals outside of the club.

8) A couple extra sentences of conversation regarding Chernobyl between John & Jack.

And there you have it, no major changes in the Extended Cut.  Despite ADGtDH's good performance at the box office, I was disappointed by what is clearly the weakest link of the Die Hard series.  From boring dialogue ""I'm on vacation"" to generic villains, there is nothing Die Hard about this latest edition.  I liked Jai Courtney as Varro in Spartacus, but the script gives him nothing to work with.  Characters are one-dimensional.  There's very little reason to care about Jack McClane, and there was no real father-son bond other than a few humorous quips.

Bruce Willis is always a fun action hero to watch, but this is really a boring movie. Yes, it has all the explosions, the car
car chases, the automatic weapons, and of course helicopters that McClane manages once more to bring down, but it still boring.
There is no real story and the fact that they go to Chernobyl for a shoot out is beyond even a sci fi movie.
Still, it is watchable if you do not expect to see the good old McClane. His son and sidekick is not a McClane for sure, and I
don't know if Jai Courtney will inherit the series, but when a series has gone to the fifth installment over 25 years there is

Alan Rickman set the bar high as Hans Gruber (Die Hard) and Jeremy Irons as his vengeful brother Simon Paul Gruber (Die Hard With A Vengeance) matched Rickman's original achievement in the charming English Actors With Weird Accent Villain Stakes. And those are the two best movies in this franchise by far.

Timothy Olyphant wasn't bad, but was far from great - they should have cast Boyd Crowder - and William Sadler in Die Hard 2 - Die Harder was the worst of the bunch. Until now. The bad guys in A Good Day To Die Hard are characterless cyphers. Two Bad Oligarchs, basically interchangeable. A deadly henchman. A treacherous daughter. And I can't remember what any of them look like or anything they had to say.

Lazy and tired, A Good Day to Die Hard is no more than a long string of seen-it-before action sequences and a ""plot"" full of holes and loose threads. As with Indiana Jones, the only interesting thing in A Good Day to Die Hard is the vaguest possibility that in giving Bruce Willis a son who also knows how to kick ass and take names the franchise may be thinking ahead.

The movies finds Detective Mclane traveling to Russia to locate his son who is on trial for a crime he committed. You may find yourself confused due to a lack of information surrounding the weak plot. The acting is horrendous. Jai Courtney who plays Bruce Willis son makes Channing Tatum look  like Daniel Day Lewis. John Mclaine is not the same character he was in the previous Die Hard films and you will notice he seems a bit softer. There are a few funny one liners but its pretty much corny dialogue with a weak script. The enemies are not memorable and their is not much action taking place. There are a few decent action pieces but other then that you may find yourself bored out of your mind if you are an action junky. If you do decide to watch this film just be aware of what to expect. The film has received low ratings for a reason. The website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 15% rating based on critic reviews and it holds a 48% rating based on reviews left by audience members such as ourselves. On the website IMDB the film holds a 5.6 out of 10 with many of the reviews not exceeding a 5 star rating. And of course Amazon users have rated the film poorly as you can tell by the mediocre 2 and half star rating. Surprisingly the film grossed over 300,000,000 million dollars worldwide.

5399000,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Go and watch the first Die Hard film. It's ok, I'll wait. Now, save your money on this awful film. You've had a good time, no need to spoil it with this. Let me save you some trouble by breaking it down for you - A Good Day to Die Hard brings John McClane (played once again by Bruce Willis, looking very bored) back to movie audiences. This time he needs to go to Russia to bail out his son Jack (played by Jai Courtney) who, it turns out, can hold his own in a fight. Together, father and son must face off against Russian terrorists looking for a file that would make them all look bad. What is on the file is really not that important to the filmmakers. There's a car chase that appears to destroy half of Russia without much consequence to our heroes, several shoot outs, and fights in Chernobyl. Nobody seems to realize they would need to wear masks just to go near it. Given the property damage and loss of life incurred, it becomes difficult to imagine that McClane isn't wanted by Interpol at the end of the film. The viewer will also notice that the film is really just a series of action scenes with a bare bones plot to tie it all together. If you were to view these scenes out of order you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. After you have all the explosions and wrecked buildings, just add Bruce Willis repeating certain lines over and over at various points in the film (""I'm on vacation!"" is one example) and you have something that the discerning movie goer hopefully didn't shell out $10 to see in theaters.

There was a time when the DIe Hard movies were fun, escapist, entertainment. In 1988, John McClane had something to say. In 2013, Bruce Willis just wants his money. Originality dies slowly and painfully. It's hard to watch.

It really is sort of refreshing that Bruce will play the oddly capable geezer.
But there's not much plot or plausibility. Its ACTION, a failure of writing perhaps, or just a setup for ACTION is the agenda in the first place.
Bad guys were played very well, though the dancing bad guy part was highly questionable...was the the actor's personal statement? Did he really want to be on Broadway instead? Disjointed at best.
Either way, it leaves a lot to be desired...pooh. but I did like it a little better than the last one. The son is given a much better part than the daughter, now there's a mistake.

5399016,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Having seen this film well over a month ago its pleasing to report that the blood pressure tablets from a good GP worked and that it is time for payback. It was Saturday night, there wasn't much on in the cinema and it seemed like a good idea at the time. As it turns out this films stinks so much Vue should have provided the cinema goer with a complimentary nose peg. Let us set aside the cynically crass exploitation of the tragic Chernobyl disaster and the ethics of this. What we have here is a rotting carcass of a film that should be entitled ""A Good Day to Give The Die Hard Franchise a Decent Burial"". Trying to describe the plot is like trying to balance on mercury and whoever wrote the script really deserves a decent spell in a Siberian labour camp. Bruce Willis's first ""Die Hard"" film was all a bit special and of course it had Alan Rickman in it to make him look good and out act everyone in sight. To be fair to Willis he was then a endearing cheeky chappy who did a decent turn and who understood that acting wasn't all about how much blood covers your tight fitting dirty vest. Sadly this execrable mess about Bruce rescuing his son from a Russian mobster with a CIA twist thrown in for good measure is just a series of incredibly loud action scenes (the film comes with a compulsory migrane) and dialogue so jug headed they ought to make Willis the Emeritus Professor of Cliche at Harvard University. By the films conclusion you almost develop a soft spot for the Russian Mafia.

Those of you who treasure the wonderful ""Team America World Police"" will recall the parody scene in Paris when in pursuit of ""terrorists"" our heroes destroy the Eiffel Tower and Louvre and kill just about every French citizen in sight. But that was done with puppets and was a brilliant p**s take. In this film we start with a huge first-act car chase through Russia where Willis kills more innocent bystanders than the bad guys could ever hope to and begs the question isn't it time that this level of brainless overkill in film was consigned to the dustbin of history? Willis now stands in the same league as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the acting stakes and as for poor old Jai Courtney this makes his performance in ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" look like Sir John Gielgud in comparison to lame brain on offer here. This reviewer had a Chinese meal after the film ruined by its lingering memory and can testify that there is nothing sweet about this film - its all sour.

Now, Live Free Or Die Hard (#4) was lacking in the sense that it was cropped content wise due to its PG-13 rating change. However I still enjoyed it alot. Now THIS DH movie (#5)was probably one of my favorites in the series. I usually don't like picking favorites (it's hard for me, lol, I like so much).
This DH movie was an awesome action flick that is underrated. Worse movies get awards and praise. People must have walked into this movie, expecting Inception or some monumental brain puzzling experience. This is not that kind of a movie. It is merely an additional chance for us to see Bruce Willis takin out baddies in a new setting with a new ally. And it succeeds as an entertaining action movie!
After 4 previous movies there's not much character building that needs to take place and to be honest if you've stuck with the series this long, it's because you like watching Willis kill. Admit it, this movie was very entertaining. When it was over, I was wishing it was longer! This is NOT a bad movie.
I'd go so far as to say this movie is better than Avengers. Avengers got WAY too much praise for what it is. Superheroes fighting aliens. That's Avengers' plot in THREE words. Try describing THIS plot in only three words. People are confused these days, they think overhyped trash like Avengers is the best movie ever crafted, then they go and bash this movie which is at least 10x better.

5399019,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"This is a difficult film to review.

Die Hard 5 is not going to please you if you are hoping for a film like the first Die Hard: underdog good cop in a situation over his head struggling to make things turn out right while the government/cops etc. try to to handle the situation.

The GOOD:

This film is an excellent action movie with a couple of ridiculous scenes--like the transition from bridge to road below, or from chopper to roof, etc. You'll understand. The action is incredible and beautifully shot. The car chase alone is a new experience, the way the bystanders and cars get tossed about. It's unlike any chase scene I can remember. The only disturbing part is how many innocents John must have killed! lol. His son has a few cool CIA gadgets. There are a few nice plot twists. On it's own, the film is a fun ride, fun to watch, thrills unfolding in a novel way.

But . . . it is not Die Hard. It is a weak reflection of the series we adore. Here's why:

1) The beginning is slow, with John literally standing around while his son does his thing. I don't EVER want to see my beloved John McClane loafing around like a lost puppy! What a lame moment. He keeps calling his son's name and truly resembles a lost old man.

2) John actually whines throughout the movie. What is that about?

During the chase he is talking to himself and most of the lines are lame.

Throughout the movie he complains that he is ""on vacation."" When did this turn into an intended vacation? It was NEVER a vacation! He went there to help his son!

He says ""Jesus Christ!"" more than a crazed Baptist minister on Sunday. I was actually guessing when he would say it again and laughing.

3) John's son sucks. Why am I watching his son? Why is my hero following his son around? It would have been a million times better if John had seen his son get killed and went out for revenge. But, no. Instead, I have to hear his son whine and see his son fight bad guys with cool CIA gadgets. While the American legend and super cop John McClane . . . helps out.

4) No cops in Russia!?! No special forces Spetsnaz or something? The terrorists and John crash through the cities and no one shows up to stop them. No one. That is a big no no. How silly.

5) The villain's plot goal is one we've seen too many times before. I won't spoil it, but come on. They could not have cooked up an original threat? The last Die Hard did that well, putting John out of his element. This is simply old hat. When you discover what it is, you'll groan.

6) The ending scene is literally a mushy musical Wonder Years, Hallmark, Lifetime moment!!!! I know what they are trying to say about John's family, but come on! Come to the point in a more creative way. Or don't at all. Let us assume it has happened. I would rather John had just yelled, ""Yippy KiYay!"" into the camera until the credits rolled.

I hate giving negative remarks about this film. There are quite a few fun John McClane moments as well as a few touching moments done well. But the film either tries too hard or tries too little when developing the relationship between father and son.

I cannot shake the feeling that his son Jack is intended to do a spin-off movie. They set it up that way, with Jack overshadowing his father a little. I hate that idea.

Can John and Jack make up and bond while killing bad guys with machine guns ?
  The film just feels rushed, uninspired and only exists for money.  There's tons of action but none of it is involving or puts us at the edge of our seats. While, the villain was the weakest, even compared to Timothy Olyphant's. Part 6 needs better writing and a better director, us fans deserve better.

5399030,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Oh, McClane, how far you have fallen.

It can be difficult to judge the latest film in a series on its own merits, because it will inevitably be viewed in comparison to the legacy of the films before it.  In the case of A Good Day to Die Hard, what could have been a decent Bruce Willis-fronted action blockbuster on its own crumbles under the weight of the prior, superior films.  In a vacuum, the film is perfect for an hour or two of brainless fun, but when everything accomplished here has been done better in prior films, it leaves the diehard Die Hard fan cold.

Where the first film was an excellent pastiche of the disaster movies popular in the 70's, and the then-contemporary 80's action hero, A Good Day to Die Hard plays out as more of an awkward blend of the recent James Bond films and the excesses of modern action video games.  The film still stars Bruce Willis's John McClane - the classic ""cop who's seen a lot"" - finding himself in way over his head, but that's where the similarities end.  This time around, our hero travels to Russia to reunite with his prison-bound estranged son (played almost begrudgingly by Jai Courtney).  Much to McClane Sr.'s surprise, though, his son is not a deadbeat criminal, but a CIA agent undercover working to smuggle a person of interest out of Russia.  McClane manages to quickly derail the entire mission, forcing Jr. and Sr. to team up and find another way out.

There is more plot beyond that, but the film loses coherency so quickly that it isn't worth recounting.  Instead, A Good Day to Die Hard throws action scene and setpiece one after another at the viewer in an increasingly thickening flurry of action, like a budget-rate magician trying to disguise the fact that his bag of tricks has run dry.  Cars are driven recklessly.  Guns are shot.  Expendable henchmen are killed en masse.  Half-hearted jokes are made.  Callbacks to previous films are made and forgotten just as quickly.  The meat of the film is this unrelenting pace of frenzied action.  And when all is said and done, it's fairly satisfying.  Leaving aside some occasionally clumsy cinematography, the fights spare no extravagance and are generally entertaining to watch.

Less than fun is the truly clumsy exposition and half-hearted acting by the main cast.  The shamelessly convoluted plot of the film serves only to hide the fact that it has more holes in it than McClane's assault rifle has bullets.  This only gets worse as the film goes on.  Courtney seems to only want to collect his paycheck and leave, and Willis appears simply incredulous that he's actually managed to end up in a fifth Die Hard movie at all.  The only halfway interesting character is the mysterious Yuri Komarov (played by Sebastian Koch), the person of interest the two McClane's are attempting to save.  Unfortunately, his character is given little to truly do, and rarely ever allowed to be more than a pawn.

In the end, A Good Day to Die Hard is not disappointing because it's big, loud, and dumb.  It's quite good at that.  It's not even that it is inferior to the other films in the series.  What is bothersome about it is that it has no respect for its source material.  The John McClane of this film is not the same one as that of the earlier films.  Instead of the original Die Hard's subtle and mostly realistic world, A Good Day to Die Hard opts for a comic book universe where these men can shrug off a hailstorm of bullets and hundred-foot falls and walk away with a swagger.  The winking references to earlier films come off as cheap and unfunny, and almost ironic, as if the film is ashamed of its much better predecessors.

In the context of the larger series it is a part of, A Good Day to Die Hard is a very weak film.  Taken on its own, it's a fun, brainless way to spend a little under two hours.  With that said, one viewing is really all this movie is ever going to be able to offer anyone before they box it away in the attic and watch Die Hard With a Vengeance again instead.

5399032,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is a fantastic edition to the Die Hard franchise

Unlike most people who write reviews, I don't quite them based on whether or not the film lived up to my personal expectations or whether or just on I had fun watching it. I review the film based on my experiences as a film student.
That been said I can now tell you as a fact that A Good Day to Die Hard is a good movie with plenty of thrills and twists the average movie watcher will not see coming.

It opens up with John taking his vacation time to support his son who has (apparently) messed up his life once again, this time with the Russian government. Things go from serious to seriously weird when Jack and a political prisoner break jail after an organization try's to murder them both with a bomb. John trying to catch up to his son to convince him to turn himself in before things get worse winds up falling into his son's real life, a freakish event that drags the McLane boys into a none stop action packed mystery of follow and kill the bad guys which intern makes the two of them become closer together.
The story leaves no questions unanswered, the acting is fantastic, the stunts are mostly real (in the true spirit of Die Hard), there are no plot holes (everything has a clear explanation even for the imposable again in the true spirit of Die Hard), and the resolution makes you want more... perfect for an action film.

My personal feelings about this film: Fun action romp but needed a bit more bonding between father and son and a bit less of the arguing scenes between father and son. The arguing got a little too repetitive and sometimes took away from the pacing of the film. Aside from that I personally give it 4 out of 5 stars.
The main reason I gave this page 5 stars is to kill all the bad reviews. This Die Hard is going into my collection the second it comes out.",1366329600,12,1871,4.279661016949152

That's the description. Turns out his son is CIA (no way!) and that for some reason John and John Jr. don't really get along (hint: because the ""plot"" demands it).

But for me as a fan of the ""Die Hard"" franchise, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" satified me in the two basic areas that have made this franchise successful 1. Bruce Willis and 2. The Action.  John McClane isn't any different here than he's been in the earlier installments.  Now Sure, having McClane Sr. go to Russia would've worked better as a possible set-up for a ""Bourne"" film and even the (supposely now cancelled ) ""24"" movie ( it's just been a little more than 3 years since the show went off, I'm not entirely bought that the movie is dead yet, that is until ""Touch"" gets canceled this season, I mean the show is in the friday fox time slot which everyone knows is death for any tv series and Kiefer Sutherland's schedule will be clear after he does Paul W.S. Anderson ""Pompli"" or whatever flick, but this can all be saved for another article). Back to ""Die Hard 5"", the Russia backdrop didn't really bother me ( but don't get me wrong the set-up to ""Olympus has Fallen"" or ""White House Down"" would've worked more effectively for ""Die Hard 5"" but are we not forgetting that John McClane battled terrorist in  D. C. in both ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" and "" Live Free or Die Hard"" so that's kinda been there done now.) Jai Counrtney didn't bother either as Jack aka John Jr., though personally I wanted someone like Joshua Jackson to play John's son.  The chemistery between Joshua Jackson and Bruce Willis could've been dynamite.  With five installments made, and just one more to go (possibly coming out in maybe 2017).  For fans of the franchise I see "" A Good Day to Die Hard"" being seen as the ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" of this franchise for our hero but even they still made "" Star Trek VI: The Unidiscovered Country"" after ""Frontier"" and all was forgiven.  I personally think that if ""Live Free"" had Lucy McClane and ""A Good Day"" has John Jr. then ""Die Hard 6"" should be about Bruce Willis' John McClane retiring, battling terrorists one more time, and having his whole family ( including his divorced wife, Holly) there when he goes out in a blaze of glory. Of course not having the whole family wiping ass with guns and all. (Laughs) And one more thing even though John Moore didn't bother too much (even though I'm not necessarily a fan of the guy's work, though I've enjoyed ""Behind Enemy Lines"" on repeated viewings), how about asking John Mcteiran to get back behind the camera (working out some kind of arrangement with his jail sentence) for Die Hard 6 and... (drumroll) Shane Black be approach to write the script for Die Hard 6 ( or direct it if Mcteiran is unavailable).  Black will have some fun with the seasoned John McClane.

5399064,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Although I've been a big fan of the ""Die Hard"" series over the past 25 years (all owned on Blu ray), I was a bit reluctant to see this one. Based primarily on the trailers and some critical reviews I was going to wait for the movie to hit HBO in a few months.

While on a road trip with my 17 year old son, he convinced me to go, himself a fan of the franchise. Even at only $4 a pop, it was time better served. John McClane (Bruce Willis, not looking his age) heads to Moscow to find out why his estranged son (Jai Courtney) has been imprisoned. It turns out son Jack did it on purpose to get close to a political prisoner who he hopes to rescue. Oh yeah, Jack's with the CIA.

Nothing in the film makes sense in reality and the script is horrible. But at any time you can expect car chases, car crashes and plenty of flying bullets, rockets and fists. I suspect this is one of those films that was storyboarded with action sequences long before someone said, ""well what's the movie about?"" They never did figure that one out. My son was more generous and gave the movie 2 stars.

Now instead of a rescue mission he is teaming with his son to stop a nuclear weapon heist. I have to start by saying that I am a huge fan of the series. This is a series that everyone has a different favorite movie and when asked what the worst one is is one you have to think about. Until now. I'm not sure what happened with this one but this is the first Die Hard movie where I seemed to get bored and lost interest pretty quick. I own the other four but I really don't think this is one I will buy. Worth seeing to complete the series but that's about it. Overall, very disappointing, the Crystal Skull of the Die Hard series. I give it a B-.",1363910400,,933,4.103825136612022
5399069,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"The movie is off from the start. Something isn't right. McClane says a few lines in the opening scene and then springs up in Russia, not saying much of anything nor do we know what he's been up to in the previous years. Note to the filmmakers, fans enjoy a few quite moments of character revelation. This movie instead shouts little hints at us about John and his son as they bicker for the first 30 minutes. Everything else is old hat in the movie. The dialogue is corny by the way and not in a fun way. A decent rental of an action movie but nothing that stands out on a whole. Really disappointing for long time Die Hard fans. They could have done so much more.",1363824000,7,664,4.1953125
5399070,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"I've never seen a a big budget sequel to a solid series fail so badly in my life (and that includes ""Godfather III."") From the director to the script to the casting to the acting, this was the most infuriatingly bad film made on this type of scale that I've ever endured. I actually went to the box office afterward and tried to get my money back. BTW, they don't do that anymore, apparently.

This is not the tone, the style or even the spirit of the series and characters that I've come to love. I even enjoyed the last one which a lot of hardcore fans bashed. This is just a really bad movie. The director was beyond clueless. Sadly though the most clueless person seems to be Willis who okayed the script and the hiring of the director for ""Max Payne."" Clearly, Willis didn't care if the film was a giant steaming present as long as he got a massive payday.

If you love the ""Die Hard"" series, I urge you not to see this film. It will only anger and ultimately sadden you deeper than a film probably ever should.",1363824000,17,1016,4.259067357512953

What Can I say I was born in the 90's, I didn't have the pleasure of seeing the other 3 on the big screen even though I saw 4 back in 07. Now Die Hard 5 had a couple good moments but not enough to satisfy, especially as a fan. Number 1, was Chemistry between Bruce Willis and the actor who played his son. Even though I'd enjoy the actor who played his son in Jack Reacher. Many movies have good chemistry between father and son like Last Crusade and Star Wars 5 & 6. Number 2, for a movie that was only 90 min it drag and felt it was long. Number 3, How many time did I have to hear Im on vacation or You never did that for me Dad. Number 4 as a big video gamer it ripped off alot of Call Of Duty and for those that played Medal of Honor they had a guy who look like the character Dusty with a Beard, hat backwards  and sunglasses. That really made me mad. Number 5, How many windows do you have to jump through in one movie. That got so old to fast. The only part I enjoyed was when Bruce Willis was in the safe house mowing down the bad guys who were coming at him. I really wish this movie was good the trailers made this movie look good but it wasn't that good. I will get it but it will be watch only when I feel like having a marathon. It would most likely gather dust in my collection if anything. This is also coming from a Die Hard Fan.",1363651200,8,1462,3.857142857142857

I was happy to see that the story moved to another country and was now focused on John's son Jack...and that John was now seen as a dad and was trying to help his son.  It was a side of Detective McClane we have not seen before.  The action in the movie is non-stop.  It's on awesome action flick and a must see.,1363564800,10,387,4.0

5399085,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Okay, John McClain is back with his son and daughter. John is in Russia. John `inadvertently' gets involved with an international spy mission. John survives some of the most amazing visual feats of action and stunts that Superman is the  only other person that would be able to make it through.

What am I talking about? Director John Moore (Max Payne, Behind Enemy Lines) takes on the 5th adventure of the New York ex-cop, John McClain, in ""A Good day To Die Hard"". (Actually the title is a derivative of a famous Star Trek Klingon quote, but oh well I digress.) From a script written by Skip Woods (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The A-Team) and using characters originally created by Roderick Thorp four movies ago, the movie is a series of things that happen one after the other and like the previous films our star, Bruce Willis (The Fifth Element, Pulp Fiction) takes us on another rollercoaster ride of action and adventure set in Russia.

Trying to catch up with his son because he doesn't know exactly what he is doing in Russia, it all becomes a foreign land to Bruce which makes it a little bit of the fish out of water story, but you can see the patterns of the old films roll out one by one. A convincing performance is done by Jai Courtney (Jack Reacher, Spartacus: War of the Damned) as Bruce's son with a hidden agenda.

Sebastian Koch (Black Book, Unknown) does a great job as the Russian persona with a secret code that the entire cast of the film is trying to get a hold of, including Bruce's son. A little predictable in areas of where the characters were going, but one or two surprise were to be had. Russian actress Yuliya Snigir (Kokoko, Obitaemyy) is new to American audiences and does a fine job as the daughter of Sebastian. She too has a weird twist or two in the film.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing, Scott Pilgrim vs The World) reprises her role as the daughter in this film, but isn't really seen much and doesn't have a to do.

Now there is a little miss-direction too, when a `villain' played by Rasha Bikvic (Taken, The Heir Apparent: Largo Witch) leads the audience to think there is something going on when actually there isn't and the real `villain' is revealed. Sound confusing? It was to me too, a little. Then they unraveled everything fairly quickly.

This movie is a little long and the best thing it has going for it are the amazing, yet unrealistic, John McClain Franchise style stunts and action sequences, especially a `chopping' helicopter finale. Other than that it was a little `ho-hum' for me - except again for the action sequences. I would wait for the blu ray or Netflix on this one.",1363305600,4,2636,4.560253699788584
5399086,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"In my opinion this was easily the worst entry in the Die Hard series, and yes I found Live Free or Die Hard far more enjoyable than this mess.  I find myself to be a very forgiving movie viewer, with silly action movies I am not looking for plausibility and detailed realism, but this was way over the top and it wasn't even tongue and cheek over the top, some of the action scenes were just insulting unrealistic e.g. when McClane jumps from a helicopter and comes out fine less than a minute afterwards, the plot was idiotic just having John McClane come to Russia and put on his cape and come to the rescue of his son.  Again this is just my take on the movie I preferred the older Die Hard movies, but that's just me......",1362787200,5,726,4.253623188405797
5399087,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"It's a commodity action flick. That part delivers: great chase scenes, great fight scenes, a few good quips, and at least a nod to one or two facts in the real world. Willis delivers a good role, this time as the father of the co-star - well, he's not the man he was 25 years ago, and there's nothing wrong with accommodating that fact.

That said, action flicks have detached themselves more and more from any real plausibility. Like, if a helicopter started firing on mid-city building, isn't there a chance that police or whatnot might notice? Ditto that way-cool chase scene through downtown Moscow. I mean, I'd expect a blue flashing light or two, even if they'd cramp the style of our lone cowboy hero type. And that spray-can that confers magic immunity to radiation - uh, yeah, right.

Classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/B0039HR5QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Days of the Condor</a>&nbsp;(1975) seem positively somnolent when compared to this adrenaline rush. They also appealed to thinking viewers - apparently an extinct breed, if this is any indication.

So, it's a great guns'n'chases movie. For better or worse, that's all it is.

5399088,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Just when you thought McClane had yippee-ki-yay'd his way out of police work, he manages to battle his way back from retirement, only this time his problems are a bit more international. After traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son, Jack (Jai Courtney), John winds up knee deep in a nuclear weapons heist. It's up to the two McClanes to put aside their differences and prevent a global outbreak of war. Add in Russian politicos, the underground crime scene and a dash of Chernobyl and you've got yourself quite the awesomely bad vacation.

A Good Day To Die Hard is one of those awesomely bad action movies that's a mix of old school heroics and modern day technologies. But before I get into my review let me start by saying, this movie is really made for die hard fans of the Die Hard series. While it might be passable for something produced in the late 80's/early 90's, it would never fly past today's high standards. You really need to go into the movie with low/no expectations in order to come out satisfied because, in a word, it's ridiculous. I feel like each Die Hard movie is a little more over-the-top than its predecessor and now that we're on the 5th one, you can only imagine what that might entail. Exploding helicopters, massive car/tank chases through the busy streets of Moscow and expertly orchestrated prison breaks. You know, just a normal days work for the McClane family.

Bruce Willis delivers all the iconic McClane lines and executes them with his trademarked squint and snarky attitude. And for a man of 57, you have to appreciate how he can still kick some serious ass. He embodies everything we come to expect from John McClane: the stubbornness, sarcasm and a take-charge now ask questions later method. What was lacking though was the father-son dynamic between him and Jack. Their relationship is anything but engaging and borders on frustratingly repetitive and hollow. I liked Jai Courtney well enough for an action guy but I just wasn't buying him as McClane Jr. Their relationship fluctuates between stony and warm fuzzies with little progression in between.

As far as the cinematography goes, Moore had a more artistic vision in this film with slow-mo sequencing and well-framed shots, but I felt like for this type of movie, it didn't really work. Often it felt out of place, unnecessary and, at times, comical. I'm sorry but I'm there f or the action, not the art direction. What really worked in this movie, though, was the location. The change in scenery felt fresh and interesting. Sure, some of the old Russian communism ""us versus them"" mentality remains, but it works for all intensive purposes. I felt like they were able to get away with a lot of the outrageous action specifically because of the setting. It was in, no way, believable but I don't think it should be. All in all, A Good Day To Die Hard isn't the best action movie I've seen, but it's not the worst either. It hits all the marks of the traditional Die Hard film with all the cheesetastic, explosive, wry action that you could want. If you're looking for awesomely bad, then you've found it. Let's just hope that the franchise follows fast in McClane's footsteps and considers a long, hard retirement.

Food for Thought: While nowhere as perfect as the original, A Good Day To Die Hard contains all the elements essential to make it a decent addition to the high-octane Die Hard saga. It's got a ridiculous plot, over-the-top action sequences, cheesy one-liners and a whole lot of yippee-ki-yaying which are essential to keep the 80's actiony feel. And while I did get a kick out of the movie, I can only hope that this was the end of an era and they let John McClane's adventures stop here. Because this series needs a good way to die hard and this movie is it.",1362614400,5,3781,4.681203007518797
5399089,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"Bruce Willis revives the role of NYC cop John McClane. He is missing his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney). A report shows he is in a Moscow prison. John takes off to Moscow, only to find out his son works for the CIA and is trying to extract Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) a Russian billionaire with a dossier on a fellow countryman everyone wants.

The extraction fails, and John offers his unwanted assistance as a gear jammer, destroying nearly every vehicle that dared the streets of Moscow. At one point the carnage becomes too much, with a drive off an overpass scene that still has me scratching my head only to be topped by later improbable scenes. The humor in the film was hit and miss, with the miss being a cheap shot at Newark. Father and son are forced to work together which leads to the formulaic ending after a few twists.

This is not the best film of the franchise. At one point I started singing ""Cat's in the Cradle"" as I realized this is supposed to be a transition film as Bruce Willis passes the baton off to an unconvincing Jai Courtney. Lots of action, if that is what you crave.

5399090,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Oh my god and wow where the words I found myself uttering as I left the multiplex after seeing A Good Day to Die Hard. The wow came out of a disbelief that I had just seen what I had and the oh my god was a lament for witnessing a dear old friend senselessly slaughtered.
 The Die Hard series has long been the zeitgeist of action cinema with it's mix of sly, but knowing humor, well developed, likeable and believable characters, it's awesome visuals effects and it's well filmed action scenes, even the more outlandish sequels were always kept in check by following these simple guidelines. However, that is now all gone, A Good Day to Die Hard has none of those things, and it's not even mindless, but enthusiastic entertainment, it's just simply mind numbing.
 Once again starring as John McClane is Bruce Willis, this time finding himself racing all across mother Russia in pursuit of his estranged son who's a ""fugitive"" in the country. John, Jr. (newcomer Jai Courtney), wanted on a drug charge, I believe, is actually a CIA operative trying to get information from a gangster (Sebastian Koch) that leads to a high ranking Russian official, who himself will stop at nothing to silence his former comrade.
 The script barely has enough plot to get from A to Z. Littered with bad dialogue, repetitive catchphrases that don't work and endless gunfire. Never does the script by Skip Woods slow down to give us character development, in fact the McClanes may be estranged, but they honestly seem like strangers and their bonding scene is laughable, in an otherwise humorless movie.
 By now, Willis must now McClane inside out, but here he doesn't even seem to be playing the guy from those earlier adventures. Gone is his wisecracking smart alky everyman  reluctant hero, in his place is an angry, obnoxious superman.
 However, Willis is not the only one who gives a tedious performance, Australian actor Jai Courtney is a real lumbering stiff of a hero. In his defense, the role has nothing to offer any actor, good or bad. But, Courtney doesn't infuse it with any charisma.  He and Willis have zilch when it comes to on-screen chemistry.
 Directed by the terrible John Moore, the misguided director who once tried to turn Owen Wilson into an action hero in the ludicrous Behind Enemy Lines. He also helmed the great looking, but boring Max Payne and the dreadful remakes of the Omen and Flight of the Phoenix. What I just don't understand is why the studio, Twentieth Century Fox, would pawn off such a lucrative franchise to an obvious hackneyed director. Yes, he's a company man, but never has one of his films been a success finically or artistically. His direction is flat, lifeless and clearly ambitionless. Just look at how far the James Bond movies have come in recent years by using quality filmmakers.
 Employing a now all too typical unsteady camera, that just annoys, it doesn't put you into the action. A Good Day to Die Hard has one of the least interesting and poorly edited car chases in movie history right out front to get things started. It's followed by nonsensical shoot outs in a very shallow script full of unlikely plot developments. Then we have some overblown stunts, that do nothing to elevate the interest. All leading up to some very, very bad special effects at the end.
 I would call A Good Day to Die Hard, the worst movie in the franchise by a long shot, but it never even feels like a Die Hard movie. It's already been established that aside from his usual catchphrase they isn't anything that connects Willis' character to his previous films. But the tone is off, and aside from paying homage to Alan Rickman's death in the first film, although it could be parody it is hard to tell here, they is little linking of these films. Mary Elizabeth Weinstead reprise her role as Lucy McClane in a pointless cameo, and she too seems to be acting out another role.
 The funny thing is that Woods' script is said to be the first Die Hard script written as a Die Hard movie. But Woods is a fairly stale and unimaginative writer, having penned such gems as X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the big screen A-Team movie and the long forgotten John Travolta-Hugh Jackman cyber thriller Swordfish. Not an once of depth or consideration is given to these characters, not one word of clever dialogue is uttered, in fact I think there is a purpose minimum of words used.
 It turns out the much maligned PG-13 rating for infinitely better Live Free or Die Hard, was the least of it's problems. A Good Day to Die Hard is R-rated, but you really wouldn't know it. The violence isn't edgier and the language is hardly foul, that would require the actors using more words and the script just couldn't allow that.
 In the previous films, the villains have been of great interest, we can even remember the name of Hans Gruber, but these villains are just stock baddies. Actually, A Good Day to Die Hard doesn't even make it clear who is the main villain, as we keep changing our main antagonist like in a video game, when one dies another just assumes his role. I wouldn't remember any of these villains by name, except there all Russkies with names like Yuri, Ivan and Viktor,  even the names are clichs.
 It's not unreasonable to expect at least a minimum of good escapist entertainment from a Bruce Willis movie, and if that is all you ask of A Good Day to Die Hard,  you still will be let down. Maybe it is that Die Hard has set such a high standard for action movies, but still there is no excuse for making such a sloppy mess.
 In years to come, A Good Day to Die Hard will be uttered in the same breath as the dismal Jaws: the Revenge. It should be studied as what not to not do it again, this is a textbook example of how to kill a finically successful franchise in a single blow.
 At ninety-seven minutes, it is the shortest Die Hard movie, but feels longer than watching all four previous movies in a single uninterrupted sitting. As it turns out, today just was not a good day to die hard instead of going out with a bang, it just goes out with a thud.

5399092,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"This is what happens, Bruce Willis, when you don't reprise your role in sequels for years. The younger generation has used Live Free or Die Hard as the standard for which these films are supposed to be living up to, and the older generation expects not only the world out of these films, but has forgotten what they are about. Why has this film gotten bad reviews? Is it because the film was truly bad and unwatchable? Is it because of Bruce Willis's pro-gun views? The latter seems to make the most sense. I mean, Live Free or Die Hard had a ridiculously positive critical reception, given how awful it was. How did this film get panned so badly? This was a great Die Hard movie. My brother agreed it was great too. I have no idea how someone could leave this film not entertained. McClane's humor and personality are back. The ridiculous, over-the-top action is back. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges, but it works.

I don't know what more people expect from movies. Rotten Tomatoes wasn't around back in the 80's and early 90's. People generally relied on their local critics and a few magazines, who generally varied in terms of impressions. Now, people base their impressions of a movie on the websites and think that if they disagree, something is wrong with them. Nothing is wrong with questioning the Emperor, people.

I go to movies to be entertained, not to find the next Oscar winner. The Academy is giving Ben Affleck awards for Best Picture, and awful actresses like Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry awards as well. The critics are panning several decent movies and praising awful ones. Why do people still listen to them?

5399105,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Another great Die Hard movie with Bruce Willis still kicking xxx.  Most of this movie takes place in Russia (or what is supposed to be Russia).  Protests in Russia are going on over political prisoner Yuri.  John McLain gets word that his estranged son John Jr. has been arrested for killing someone and is in a Russian prison.  Of course, John takes off for Russia just as his son and Yuri are  being taken into the courthouse for trial.  As you might suspect, they escape and John takes off after them.  It is an interesting movie and even takes them to what is supposed to be Chernobyl later in the movie.  Of special interest was the absolutely amazing car chase scene, probably the longest one I have ever seen.  They really went all out on the stunts.

OK--Yeah--It was severe BS. I mean, going over to Russia and doing all the typical Die Hard type stuff seemed a bit unbelievable, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun.  Nobody wants to see something ordinary.  You want to see the impossible odds getting overcome.

With that said, the movie was pretty much non-stop action with lots of stunt work and busting up things and kicking xxx.  Lots of fun for the action junkie.  I plan to get the DVD as soon as it becomes available.",1362009600,3,1234,4.4708520179372195
5399106,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Twentieth Century-Fox has been beating this dead horse for twenty-five years. It is kind of cute and quaint; when every studio is remaking classic films or trying to rejuvenate a once successful franchise with a 'prequel', Fox steadfastly decides to keep plugging away and we have the fifth ""Die Hard"" film, quite possibly the worst, and hopefully the last.

Fox does introduce us to a younger character who could take over the franchise, if necessary and if this film makes enough money. This has been done before, but it doesn't work. The reason we want to see an ""Indiana Jones"" film is to see Harrison Ford play the role he made famous. The reason we want to see a ""Die Hard"" film is to see the role that made Bruce Willis' film career. But let's face it, while Willis has held up better than his ""Expendables"" co-stars, he won't last forever and Fox will probably try to make at least one more ""Die Hard"", which is why he now has an adult son, played by Jai Courtney (the unstoppable hit man in ""Jack Reacher""). Conceivably, Courtney will take over the series and play Die Hard in the next film.

John McClane learns his son, John (Courtney) has been arrested for murder in Russia. The elder John decides to travel there; what he hopes to accomplish, he doesn't seem to know and we never learn. But he arrives in Moscow just in time for his son's sentencing, which happens to take place at the exact same time as the sentencing of a Russian businessman, Kamarov (Sebastian Koch), the main rival of Chagarin, both of whom are the top candidates for the Minister of Defense position. Chagarin has jailed his rival, in the hopes he will talk and reveal the whereabouts of a damaging file. But he won't so an attempt is made on the heavily fortified courthouse on the day of the trial, causing a lot of confusion and destruction. This only allows John the Younger to help Kamarov to escape. Just as they are leaving the courthouse, John literally drives right into his father before speeding off. But John the Elder senses something is wrong (all of the explosions are a giveaway) and chases after them. But the bad guys are also in hot pursuit and the three groups began a destructive, improbable, yet exciting chase through the crowded Moscow city center. Eventually, we learn that Junior is an undercover CIA agent sent to help Kamarov. But there are more secrets leading to a showdown at Chernobyl. Yes, Chernobyl.

Directed by John Moore (""Max Payne"", ""The Omen (2006)"", ""Flight of the Phoenix (2004)"") and written by Skip Woods (""The A-Team""), ""Good Day"" has one good action sequence (the chase through the Moscow streets) but little or no character development, the most inane dialogue I have ever heard in an action film (that's saying a lot) and a story that is tasteless. Mix all of this together and this IS the worst ""Die Hard"" film.

Generally, sequels tend to get bigger in scope because the filmmakers hope this will increase the odds of you purchasing a ticket for the new film. The ""Die Hard"" films are no exception; the first film is set in a Los Angeles office building, the second in an airport, the third in New York City, the fourth concerns a threat to the entire country and this new film features an international adventure. Yet, oddly with each new film the storytelling seems to shrink and the smaller scope has an adverse effect on the quality and substance of the films. A lot of the reason for this is that as each film expands the threat, the writing seems to become more rote and much less interesting. The first film is still the best because the threat to John is very personal. He just happens to arrive at his wife's office building as a group of terrorists takes it over to hold everyone hostage. The original is a terrific film, giving us a lot of detail and back-story for the hero and the villain, making both of them very human and believable. And it never hurts to have Alan Rickman in your film playing the villain. In ""II"", the threat is increased, but however improbable, McClane and his wife are still under threat, so there is still some immediacy to the action. With each new film, McClane has evolved further and further into a cartoon character getting into improbable situations with no character development. In ""Good Day"", the action seems small and confined, despite the international locale. What does John McClane expect to do in Russia? How does he see this plan unfolding? Part of the delight of the first film is that McClane is thrust into a situation and has to figure out how to control it. In this new film, he enters this world and begins to insinuate himself into it. Yes, he is trying to help his son, but he isn't under threat until he steps into this situation and begins messing around.

One of the keys to making this film work is to make us feel some empathy towards the characters. Willis seems to smirk his way through the entire film. There are brief moments between McClane and his partner and between McClane and his daughter (who was taken hostage in the fourth film), but these don't do anything except establish the fact that John is estranged from his son. And when Courtney enters the picture, it is clear the family dynamic is strained, John Jr. holds a gun on his father which is an interesting way to illustrate the family dynamic for us. It also does nothing to make us like J.J. Later, after they barely escape a barrage of bullets, John Sr. begins chastising his son as he contemplates removing a piece of rebar sticking out of his chest. ""Are you going to cry? You're not going to cry on me are you?"" Maybe John Jr. has a reason to feel estranged from his father. John Sr. seems like a pretty big jerk. And this moment does nothing to build any sense of family between them. Also, because we don't really like either of them who are we supposed to root for? Later, it seems as though someone flips a switch because suddenly the father and son are working together in harmony, smiling and joking with one another.

The film eventually ends up at Chernobyl as the McClanes attempt to stop the villains from removing enriched uranium. Chernobyl? Really? This just seems incredibly tasteless. As the film casually states, 50,000 people were immediately moved and uprooted when the meltdown happened. The film doesn't seem to dwell upon the deaths or resulting health problems experienced by so many people in the area. This isn't surprising because it would no doubt turn off a lot of the viewers and cut into the popcorn sales.

I keep going to the ""Die Hard"" films because I am an optimist. I keep hoping that one of these films will be able to at least approximate a small portion of what made the first film so good. Great action, edge-of-your-seat suspense, a brilliant villain, and a personal threat to the hero making us feel for his character and really care about what happens to him. In ""Good Day"", the villain is forgettable and after one of his henchmen dies, almost nothing of interest happens with this group. It is not a good thing when the villain's henchman is more interesting than the actual villain. Quick, what was the name of each villain who employed Jaws in the two James Bond films? But if you say ""Blofeld"" to any James Bond fan, they immediately know who you are talking about. There is no suspense. McClane walks into a situation and then starts shooting, so we really don't feel anything for him or his son.

And Courtney is really never given anything to do with his portrayal of John Jr. He is an undercover CIA agent who has to deal with an increasingly difficult situation, but the development of his relationship with his father is laughable and does nothing to make him likable. And because he isn't likable, we don't care about what happens to him.

Maybe this is the studio's way of setting up the sequel, ""Die Hard with Charm"". Die Hard Jr. (Courtney) attends charm school to make him a more likable character. While there, the strict German headmistress, Fraulein Gruber (Alan Rickman in drag) decides to extract her revenge. The story almost writes itself.",1361923200,6,8081,4.617954070981211
5399107,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"""A Good Day to Die Hard"" stars Bruce Willis as wise-cracking NYPD Detective John McClane, the human magnet for trouble. In this movie, McClane takes some personal time to fly to Moscow and find out why his estranged son John Jr. is on trial for murder. He will discover that John Jr. is part of a CIA covert plot to liberate a wealthy political prisoner named Komarov, who may have dirt on a rising Kremlin official.

McClane walks into a full-scale assault on a Moscow courthouse by a group of mercenaries, and ends up joing his son and Komarov in a demolitio derby run through the streets, that ends at a CIA safehouse. Father and son will agree, reluctantly, to work together to protect Komarov, only to walk into an ambush at a meeting hosted by Komarov's untrustworthy daughter. Beyond the reach of the CIA, the McClanes carry the fight to Chernobyl (yeah, that Chernobyl) for a final confrontation at a bank vault in the empty city. Between firefights, the McClanes will attempt to patch up their differences.

Its fun to Willis as McClane again, but the movie needs a little work. The dialogue is hit or miss, and the on-screen dynamic between Willis and Jai Courtney as his son never really clinks. There is plenty of action, and some humor, but this one for die hard fans of the franchise only.",1361836800,,1303,4.612068965517241
5399108,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"""A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is a bad day at the theater,"" sneered my snobby pal, and I felt like disowning him. But, okay, the law of diminishing returns does apply here. Twenty-five years since the release of the best Christmas movie of all time (and, yes, cretin, I mean DIE HARD), A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD ranks fifth in the series, in chronology and in excellence. I am a shameless DIE HARD apologist, but even I don't hesitate to say that this one disappoints on key levels. It is, essentially, a generic Bruce Willis action movie masquerading as a DIE HARD movie.

It's been more than five years since the last one (LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, 2007). Them powers-that-be must've thought that the franchise still had legs, and, of course, they're not wrong. The classic first film had built up such good cachet that as long as Willis is willing to make more sequels, folks will flock to the theaters. But there's real jeopardy that the franchise is getting run to the ground. If it hasn't happened already.

Indestructible everyman - and that oxymoron is a problem right there - John McClane hears word that his estranged son, Jake, is in trouble in Russia and he immediately books a flight. In Moscow, John McClane reunites with Jake (Jai Courtney) and learns that his son is an undercover CIA operative currently safeguarding a government whistleblower from a corrupt Russian official. Cue the explosions and car chases and the close shaves and the half-hearted banter, with Willis and Courtney striving for - and mostly failing to achieve - a measure of chemistry. With my mindset forever locked on this view that Bruce Willis is irreproachable, I put the blame on the writers.

There's a bit of a renaissance of the old school Rated R action thriller, what with this picture and also Schwarzenegger's recent THE LAST STAND and Stallone's BULLET TO THE HEAD. Of the three, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD exhibits the most impressive box office punch. Of course, there's this understanding that if this had been a non-DIE HARD Bruce Willis project, it's doubtful that it would've raked in as much profit. As a generic action film, it serves the nondiscriminating viewer. But if you'd been spoiled by how good the first DIE HARD was, then this is a dumbed down sequel, empty of nuances of character and devoid of the smarts and wicked humor that graced the original. The villains are so cardboard they should be propped up on the Santa Monica Pier for bystander photo ops. I pine for Hans Gruber.

The most egregious offense is the treatment of John McClane who is now a pale imitation of his old self. Willis is a terrific actor. He's good enough that there are still traces of the humanity and the snark and the everyman appeal that won over critics and fans 25 years ago. Still, when he finally voices his trademark phrase, it doesn't feel like the film had earned it. There's enough popcorn fun in this one that I don't mind rating it 3 out of 5 stars. A present day sequel that is a shadow of its source material. But nostalgia is a powerful thing.

As a continuity fiend I appreciate Mary Elizabeth Winstead's cameo as Lucy McClane.

Also, I want whatever magical GPS device the McClanes used to navigate from Moscow to the Ukraine in the span of an evening.",1361750400,,3251,4.606217616580311
5399109,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"Bruce Willis returns to the Die Hard franchise in the fifth installment, A Good Day to Die Hard.  This time around, John McClane is off to Russia to give his son, Jack (Jai Courtney), more support as he awaits trial for carrying out an assassination.  Undercover for the CIA, Jack is secretly trying to rescue a political prisoner, Yuri (Sebastian Koch)  who is supposedly in possession of a file (hold incriminating evidence) to put a corrupt Russian official, Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov), behind bars.  However, when Jack comes face to face with his father, he couldn't be any less happier to see him.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead also returns to the series as McClanes daughter, Lucy.

Oh, where to begin with this mess of a film  Unlike the previous sequels in the Die Hard franchise, this newest addition is a complete and utter disaster from beginning to end, serving no other purpose than to shoot guns, create explosions, and have a ridiculous car chase.  From pitiful, shaky camera work to forced dialogue with poor one-liners, this film is easily the worst in the franchise.  Its not very often that poor editing is comparable to Michael Bays Armageddon, but this newest Die Hard certainly brings up those bad memories of too many cut scenes messed together, which easily creates the potential for a very bad headache.  And, if the constant cut scenes don't do it, then theres a good chance having to read a fair amount of subtitles will make it happen.

As usual, theres no need to focus too much on the acting in an action film of this nature.  In fact, if Bruce Willis had a stuntman even remotely resembling his face, thered be no need for Bruce to be on set at all.  This film features so little dialogue from Willis that it will almost make you wonder how many millions he makes per word.  To be fair, its really difficult to add smart dialogue into a film that fills most of its gaps with bullets and grenade blasts.  However, in true Willis fashion, he does roll out a few humorous one-liners that will create a brief chuckle  most of which happen during those stressful, dire situations where your average person would no doubt be in the middle of a panic attack or searching for the nearest escape route.

The absolute biggest problem with the film is the lack of a serious, credible villain.  Looking back at the rest of the Die Hard films, we are blessed with Alan Rickman, William Sadler, Jeremy Irons, and Timothy Olyphant  yet in this film we get some random Russian (without any real backstory) that, in the end, tries (poorly) to be Jacks version of Hans Gruber.  Obviously, this shouldnt be too much of a spoiler since its unrealistic to believe the villain doesnt get whats coming to him by the time the credits role.  Never the less, the need for a more melicious villain is at the top of the list on the long list of complaints regarding this fifth installment.  Perhaps more time should have been spent establishing a dramatic plot  as in the previous films  and this might have been a more enjoyable experience.

Lastly, it should be noted that the ending of this film raises a great many questions about the franchises future.  Jai Courtney is a relatively unknown actor (as was Willis at one time), so its possible the reigns might be in the process of being handed over to him.  Its a logical conclusion since Jack McClanes real name is purposely stated in the film as being John McClane Jr.  Of course, its too early to say whether or not this will be the final film in the franchise, but in the event that it is  this is really not the way youll want to see John McClane go out.  Heres hoping for one more ride, and a far better send off.

5399110,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"Die Hard was once a great series that featured a loveable charachter facing down the improbable, with great action, in a compelling story. But, the improbable has become the impossible in it's fifth installment, with over the top special effects, a weak storyline, and some very dry acting. I am an action junkie and Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, but the essence of John McClane died a long time ago. Right from the start I could tell that Willis wasn't all that into this and it shows, as McClan goes from being the ultimate tough guy to a man just going through the motions. The story centers around reuniting with his son in a foreign country, which I though was an interesting twist, but the angle as well as any semblance of a story was barely touched upon. Die Hard 5 was just one over the top action scene after another, with very little substance, emotion, or appeal for audiences. The John McClan we knew and loved, the man who saved the Nakatomi building, is long gone, instead he is replaced by an emotionless man who expects this sort of thing to happen to him wherever he goes. Willis was going through the motions for a big pay day, and while there were some good lines and some great action sequences, there isn't much of a story or cast to write about. Die Hard 5 is about making money through special effects, using characters who have long out lived their usefulness. If this is how the series has evolved than I pray that this will be the end of it. If the producers want to milk more money out of the franchise, maybe they can wait ten years or so and have some British hunk remake it, with Willis making a cameo, until then, I must declare the Die Hard series official dead with A Good Day To Die Hard.",1361491200,2,1736,4.377708978328173
5399111,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"I'm a fan of the Die Hard franchise.  Up until A Good Day to Die Hard, the Die Hard series has been on an amazing run with excellent action stories.  A Good Day to Die Hard has lots of action, but it leaves me longing for more story.  The script is very weak.  Hope the next one will be better.",1361318400,5,294,3.85
5399112,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Watched it at an Imax in Manila. The action scenes are way over the top but it is Die Hard. The acting was good and the humor was not overdone.
Willis still looks good and delivers the lines and the action in his usual style. The best Die Hard after the original. Hope they release a 3D version in blu ray",1361232000,12,305,4.016393442622951
5399113,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"It has been 25 years since the first Die Hard, featuring the worlds unluckiest cop John McClane, hit the screen in 1988. None of the three sequels made so far is as good as the original (which was Oscar-nominated in four categories, including Best Film Editing), but they all are still decent action movies  probably much better than A Good Day to Die Hard, the fifth installment which is easily the least effective of the popular series.

Once again, Bruce Williss John McClane finds himself at the wrong time in the wrong place. This time the story begins in Moscow, where John is reunited with his estranged son Jack, in the middle of the attack by heavily armed men trying to capture a certain Russian witness. This is a pretty contrived set-up, but we can ignore it as long as the action set-pieces that follow are good.

Action sequences are fast and loud, with so many cars sliding, flipping and crashing into each other, or so many bullets flying and finally everything in sight exploding, but the film fails to build up tension because of the poor editing and redundancy. The films action scenes just drag on, not knowing where to go or when to stop.

But perhaps the most disappointing part of the movie is the lack of charisma, if not on the part of the star. Bruce Williss character needs a supporting character, be it a villain or ally, who can hold his/her own, someone like Samuel L. Jacksons Zeus Carver or, of course, Alan Rickmans Hans Gruber. Jai Courtney as Jack McClane is not bad; he is just passable. As to the Russian terrorists, they are mere cyphers, absolutely no menace to John McClane from the beginning.

With the weak storyline and unmemorable characters, A Good Day to Die Hard is at best another routine blockbuster. It is not terrible, but a routine action movie is not what we want from the Die Hard series.",1361145600,3,1842,4.603658536585366
5399114,2,B00A7ZH8GM,"Although I've been a big fan of the ""Die Hard"" series over the past 25 years (all owned on Blu ray), I was a bit reluctant to see this one.  Based primarily on the trailers and some critical reviews I was going to wait for the movie to hit HBO in a few months.

While on a road trip with my 17 year old son, he convinced me to go, himself a fan of the franchise.  Even at only $4 a pop, it was time better served.  John McClane (Bruce Willis, not looking his age) heads to Moscow to find out why his estranged son (Jai Courtney) has been imprisoned.  It turns out son Jack did it on purpose to get close to a political prisoner who he hopes to rescue.  Oh yeah, Jack's with the CIA.

Nothing in the film makes sense in reality and the script is horrible.  But at any time you can expect car chases, car crashes and plenty of flying bullets, rockets and fists.  I suspect this is one of those films that was storyboarded with action sequences long before someone said, ""well what's the movie about?"" They never did figure that one out.  My son was more generous and gave the movie 2 stars.",1361145600,10,1088,4.1380952380952385
5399115,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"The ""Die Hard"" series continues. It is safe to say, while all of the ""Die Hard"" movies have been good, none of them held a candle to the original. The series has lasted five films on the strength of what was probably the best or one of the best action movies of all time. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" won't be changing that. Not even close. ""Die Hard"" had too many elements that have been forgotten in its following films. The most important being that John McClane didn't defeat the large number of terrorists by acting like the Terminator. He did it by using his brain. He outsmarted them. He got into their heads and made them make mistakes. He did dangerous things, but they were all feasible, or at least somewhat humanly possible.

""A Good Day to Die Hard"" brings back a little bit of that human element as McClane learns that his son, Jack (Jai Courtney) is in some sort of trouble in Russia. They are estranged, but John is determined to stand beside him in his time of need or try to patch things up. His son isn't so happy to see him and once they are together, John is hurdled into his son's life and situation like you would expect, with guns blazing and cars crashing.

At the end of ""Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard"", John McClane faces off against a F-35 that basically annihilates a highway intersection and then somehow he ends up on the wing of the plane, balancing, surviving like Spiderman and in that moment, the series died to me. The series had lowered itself to the worst common denominator of action films in the 21st century. Thankfully, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" redeemed itself on that level; somewhat. There is at least nothing THAT silly. Sure, there were some crazy things, even a pretty unrealistic and poorly staged scene where McClane drives over cars in a traffic jam, but nothing as bad as the F-35.

The action scenes are good in this movie. Yet, after watching something like ""Skyfall"" from earlier this year, ""Die Hard"" sort looks dated and like yesterday's action movie. The story is pretty simple; of course so were the stories in all the other movies. You don't want to confuse the audience when all they want is carnage. Unfortunately though, in my humble opinion, carnage is overrated if you don't feel invested.

""A Good Day to Die Hard"" did a lot of things right or at least turned the corner in the right direction, but it still is just an average action movie in today's new standard. There will always be a box office for action movies and I don't blame people for going to see this or buy it. Although, the real test of a great action movie is whether or not it will be talked and reviewed about 5 or 10 years from now, like ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon 1 & 2"", ""Aliens"", ""Skyfall"", ""True Lies"", ""48 Hours"" or ""Terminator 1&2"". ""A Good Day to Die Hard""...  won't.

There just wasn't enough in ""Good Day to Die Hard"" to make your heart race and feel invested as if your own life depended upon McClane succeeding like in ""Die Hard"". Unfortunately the makers of the ""Die Hard"" movies forgot that the success of the series was more attributed to the line, ""Tell her that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, she never heard me say I'm sorry."" Rather than the relentless and ""Expendables"" type action sequences.",1361145600,,3320,4.434426229508197
5399116,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"Bruce Willis cracks wise.  Cars crash.  Bullets fly.  Things explode spectacularly.  If this is what you're expecting from ""A Good Day to Die Hard"", you won't be disappointed.

It should go without saying that the Die Hard movies aren't exactly Shakespeare.  While the first in the series revolutionized the action genre, the title has become a brand name that fans trust, and audiences have a fair idea what to expect with each new entry.  Most Bruce Willis movies are carried by the star's charisma and likability, and unlucky NYPD detective John McClane is his quintessential role.  While the first two movies were based on separate novels, the third was a finished script tweaked to include the McClane character, and the fourth was a dramatization of an article on cyberterrorism, Skip Woods' script may be the first written intentionally around the hero of the franchise.  Not only does it have some nice nods to the previous films, but it hits all the major bullet points of the formula.  As always, McClane finds himself in the most dangerous situations when he's off duty (""I'm supposed to be on vacation!"" he growls several times when he's held at gunpoint).  He gets out of desperate situations by improvising dangerous feats that would make James Bond think twice.  Only to begin chastising himself, out loud for the audience's benefit, after he's already taken the plunge and realized what a stupid idea it was.

Unfortunately, the movie lacks a strong villain for McClane to play cat and mouse with.  Previous movies had Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, and Timothy Olyphant chewing the scenery in that capacity.  This time, evil is mainly personified by the forgettable Radivoje Bukvic, but, like William Sadler in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard-2-Die-Harder/dp/B00AGDX2F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard 2: Die Harder</a>, he's not as important as the series of plot twists and turns slowly revealing a greater evil at play.  Only brief moments of exposition break up the set pieces here, starting with a lengthy car chase, one of the best I've seen in a long time, during which everything you'd want to have happen in a chase scene does.  The action moves from the Moscow highway to Chernobyl, packed with exciting pyrotechnics and stunts that look like they'd be fun in real life if it weren't for the fact that they'd maim anyone who hadn't already thwarted major terrorist plots four times before.

This time, McClane learns his estranged son, John ""Jack"" McClane Jr., is about to stand trial in Moscow.  Wanting to reconcile before Jack's thrown in prison, John Sr. makes it to the courtroom right as his son escapes, along with another prisoner awaiting trial (Sebastian Koch).

Mary Elizabeth Winstead returns as John's daughter Lucy.  While she doesn't get to see any of the action this time around, she's still great in the role and it's nice to see some continuity with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Free-or-Die-Hard/dp/B0011MZOEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Free or Die Hard</a>&nbsp;from six years ago.  Jai Courtney, for his part, does a good job playing McClane's son, sharing his dad's short temper and penchant for yelling at himself when he makes a mistake.  But the real stand out is Yuliya Snigir as Irina, the beautiful daughter of Jack's fellow escapee.  Big eyed, pouty lipped, and leather clad, Yuliya Snigir is seriously gorgeous and commands more screen presence than any of the other newcomers to the series.

My only real complaint is that the movie ends too quickly.  After the story's best plot twist, when the movie seems to be picking up real momentum, the movie reaches its finale at around the length the other Die Hard movies were just gearing up for their third act.  The ""Yippee-Ki-Yay"" catchphrase is thrown in there, and it feels a little too obligatory.

But, to recap, Bruce Willis does what Bruce Willis does best, the stunts and explosions are thrilling and come non-stop, the script includes some truly surprising twists, and Yuliya Snigir's mouthful of a name is about to become a household one.  While ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is far from the best in the series, it sure beats most of the alternatives playing in theaters this February.",1361059200,7,4303,5.213662790697675
5399117,1,B00A7ZH8GM,"The first four ""Die Hard"" films have something in common. No, not the fact that things blow up, or that Bruce Willis is going to say funny things. Underneath all of the explosions, gunshots, and profanity lies a strong character, interesting plots, and memorable set pieces. This is why it is incredibly disheartening that I saw ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" less than 24 hours ago, yet can barely remember any of it. There were some explosions, a helicopter... maybe Willis said something funny once? Perhaps twice?

I'm not quite sure, but what I am sure of is that this is one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Everybody involved should be embarrassed about this miserable abomination of a film, and request that it be removed from their resume. The plot is garbage, it's xenophobic and homophobic, and to top it all off, the action isn't even inspired. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a disgrace to a once great franchise.

We kick things off with John McClane searching for his son in Russia, who was magically never mentioned for four films. In that span of time, John McClane Jr. (ooh, original!) has apparently become a degenerate and been thrown in prison. But as we quickly find out, he's actually a CIA Agent! And Bruce Willis has to help him, but is employing meatheaded tactics for espionage missions! It's a giant culture clash! Oh, the hilarious shenanigans! Mix it up with some classic ""American trying to speak a foreign language"" and ""like father, like son"" gags, add in some monosyllabic tough guy dialogue, and you've got a surefire recipe for cinematic gold.

Except you don't. The story in this movie is the narrative equivalent of an overflowed gutter: you're seeing nothing but ugly mush of something that was maybe, at some point, kind of pretty. Dialogue is simplistic and unfunny, the narrative is derivative and moronic, and there's a disgusting gay stereotype of a character. Nothing even remotely original occurs in the span of this film, and I feel genuinely sorry for Willis and all others involved having to participate in a movie that was seemingly penned by a third-grader with access to the internet.

However, something about the story is more infuriating than the rest of it, and it deserves note: the villains. Namely, the fact that their goal is never stated. All we know is that they are Russian, and that they might want uranium. No, really, that's it. That's all they give us. We're just supposed to assume that a Russian scientist wants uranium left in Chernobyl for nefarious purposes, for no reason other than the fact that he's a Russian scientist. Oh, and there's the little fact that the American father and son beat out the Russian father and daughter, therefore adding sexism onto the laundry list of this film's dubious achievements.

But maybe you don't care about plot. Maybe you're in it for big-budget action. Well, get ready for disappointment, because the action sequences are some of the most dull and uninspired I've ever seen. Yawn with apathy as Bruce Willis defies physics in a car! Play ""Angry Birds"" as he jumps off a thirty story building and lives! And go to the bathroom as a villain falls into a vertically-rotating helicopter blade as it traverses a horizontal plane! Heck, while you're in there, you might as well stay out and go home, because this trash won't get any better.

What really tops it off is that the budget feels nonexistent. The cinematography is a joke, some shots looking like they might as well be stock footage. The overused CGI is pretty hokey too, becoming downright cheesy and ludicrous about halfway throughout the movie. That is, if you haven't fallen asleep already, which the grating and jarring sound effects will try to prevent quite frequently. On a technical level, this movie is a joke, and makes me actually want to sit through a Michael Bay movie because of how terrible it is.

Some may think this review indicates that I hate plotless action movies, and I'll have you know that I love the ""Expendables"" franchise, and pretty much anything with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Statham taking the top billing. This movie has not earned my ire because it is an action movie with no plot; it's earned it because it's an action movie with poor action and a plot that tries to be emotionally engaging but fails in a spectacular fashion. This is insipid cinematic garbage of the lower caliber, and should put a nail in the coffin of writer Skip Woods, whose past credits includes the awful ""Hitman"" film.

Now, I laughed my way through this movie, so if you want to pay ten bucks to laugh at how terrible a film is, then by all means, go see this. But if you want to go see it because you have fond memories of the old films, then you deserve to know that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a failure on every possible level. It is a bottom-of-the-barrel carnival ride with an awful plot and lame action sequences, with no funny one-liners or interesting villains to speak of. When the year ends, I have a strong feeling that this will be a surefire candidate to take the Razzy for ""Worst Picture.""

Perhaps John McClane needs to ""yippee ki-yay"" into the sunset... and a retirement home.

5399118,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"Yes, John McClane is back.  That's good, except this particular outing is not exactly the best of the quintet.  In fact, at best it probably ranks somewhere around the fourth or fifth of the bunch.  The franchise is getting lazy.  REALLY lazy, but more on that in a minute.

On the flip side, you probably didn't come to this one to think, anyway.

This time McClane is in Russia: his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) has turned up in Moscow, charged with murder, and he's copping a plea deal by testifying against a highly popular political prisoner whose trial could bring down a (need I say it?) corrupt high-ranking Russian official.

But as always, there are complications.  As the commercials tell you, his son is a CIA spy, deep undercover, and the only thing about him that's real is his deep-seated anger at his father.  Regardless, John flies out to Moscow (filled in for nicely by shots of Budapest, Hungary).

Given the immensity of the case against the dissident, that John and Jack will even see each other would be problematical; that they would meet would seem impossible.  But of course the impossible comes true, and the pair go around Russia shooting up everything.

That any of this makes sense is utterly beside the point.  For instance, there is practically no interference by the Russian police; at no time during any of the many over-the-top sequences do any of the cops seem to be anywhere in the picture...during helicopter shootouts and battles on rooftops, there is no sign of the local constabulary. But then again, Russia's known to be a pretty free-and-easy laid-back country, isn't it?  So this would make sense.

Additionally, when the two McCanes are running around Moscow with the country's Most Wanted Man, THEY DON'T EVEN COVER HIS HEAD WITH A HAT.  And nobody notices him...even bleeding from a bullet wound in his arm.  But if I have toilet paper stuck to my heel, I catch it from everyone.

Though director John Moore (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Max-Payne-Unrated/dp/B001O5187E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Max Payne (Unrated)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-Of-The-Phoenix/dp/B000J00SDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight Of The Phoenix</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Behind-Enemy-Lines/dp/B000L9EKL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Behind Enemy Lines</a>) is not exactly an A-movie guy, he does a fair job of framing close ups.  I cannot remember a Die Hard with as many head-and-shoulder shots, and it works here in the set ups, especially because of the character in Willis' wrinkled eyes and bald pate...and that's before he gets the crap beaten out of him.

And yes, this plot is pretty much paper thin...at least in the other stories, when all hell broke loose and McClane  began working his magic, he was usually lost in the midst of a larger story that required the full attention of the police or whomever.  But, as mentioned earlier, there is no hint of any real police action...after one firefight, both the Russians and the American CIA seem to throw up their hands and say, ""Hey, this is too rough for us!"" and drop right out of the picture.

But the movie is chock full of enjoyable car crashes, shoot outs, helicopter stunts and full-blown confrontations that it's unlikely you'll care much about all of this, anyway.  Each stunt is as gigantic as always, so don't think you're being cheated in this regard.  If you came to see big stunts, you won't be disappointed in the least.

It's just as jam-packed with scenes of mayhem as the other Die Hards, and some of it (but not a lot) is worth the admission price: a scene where they fall through several levels of debris, boards, glass and ceilings (as seen in the commercials); car chases that include military vehicles being launched through the air; and the destruction of an entire floor of a hotel by a military helicopter is striking.

And the demise of one particularly onerous bad-guy is particularly crunching: we just begin to wonder if the film has entirely given up on originality - since this villain's initial downfall is virtually identical to one in the original, first, movie - when all of a sudden something comes along and practically vaporizes him...to the amused groans of the movie audience.

All in all, this Die Hard is a fun movie, but it doesn't live up to its potential...the franchise could be at risk if it doesn't do better than this.  While it could be surmised the series is possibly looking to set up Jai Courtney's taking the reins, and he does a passable job, he lacks the wise-cracking persona that identified this series and its three previous sequels.

But if they want to continue, it has to do more, ESPECIALLY at today's prices: it's one thing to pay for myself and my daughter to see a weak but entertaining movie, but to have paid almost $30 to do so?

You have to do better, Die Hard.",1361059200,144,4960,5.116625310173697
5399119,5,B00A7ZH8GM,"""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners cop John McClane for the first time finds himself on foreign soil after traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son Jack -- unaware that Jack is really a highly-trained CIA operative out to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McClanes discover their opposing methods make them unstoppable heroes.

The cast led by Bruce Willis (as John McClane) & Jai Courtney (as Jack McClane) is pretty good. The directing by John Moore is pretty good. The story & screenplay by Skip Woods is pretty good.

The music by Marco Beltrami is pretty good. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is pretty good. The film editing by Dan Zimmerman is pretty good. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Tricia Wood is pretty good. The production design by Daniel T. Dorrance is pretty good. The art direction by Nick Blanche, Tom Brown, Bence Erdelyi & Andrew Munro is pretty good. The set decoration by Jille Azis & Zoltan Horvath is pretty good. The costume design by Bojana Nikitovic is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Gerd Nefzer (also supervised the special effects), supervised by Nefzer, Uli Nefzer & Paul Stephenson is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Jennifer Duncan, Vanessa Joyce, Chelsea Kammeyer, Dave Kim, Nicholas Murphy, Kim Rampaul, Sharon Roberts, Jeff Winkle & Shanshan Xie, supervised by Ed Bruce, Everett Burrell, Eric D. Christensen, Sean Andrew Faden, Bryan Godwin, Randy Goux & Viktor Muller is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Steve M. Davison & Mark Henson is pretty good.

This is a pretty good sequel to the ""Die Hard"" series, it's not the best in the series, but it's a decently good entry that is decently entertaining and well-done. Bruce Willis is still as good as he was 25 years ago when he started playing the role of John McClane, the role that broke him into movies, successfully. This is also a decently-good action movie.",1360972800,7,2039,4.88728323699422
5399120,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"My husband really wanted to see ""A Good Day To Die Hard' and I agreed to it for Valentine's Day.  He appeared to like the action scenes and the theme of having Bruce Willis team up with his son while strengthening the father and son bond.  I actually agree with this, but there was one caveat that I did not agree with in the film. The bad guy and his daughter were also paired together to fight the protagonists.  The actor and actress did their job well in the villain parts, but I feel that creating a bad guy with his son would have gave the movie a less misogynistic spin.  Other than the caveat, ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is a decent action film.",1360972800,5,651,4.142857142857143
5399121,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"If only this wayward son (Jai Courtney's character of John ""Jack"" McClane Jr.) had carried on...

Wait: objection! If young Jack had carried on, we'd have no A Good Day to Die Hard! No matter how bad the quality of this picture is, something is better than nothing, right?

Aside from over-the-top humor (which only comes and goes, sadly enough) and the best Die Hard soundtrack to surface (with the music of both Frank Sinatra and The Rolling Stones!), A Good Day to Die Hard is far from, well, ""a good day to die hard.""

Instead, what you have here is a very bad day to die hard........John McClane Sr. may be a legend, but his father Bruce Willis has simply lost his freakin' mind!

What I mean by that, I will discuss later in this review. Until then.....here's the basic information for ya.....

A Good Day to Die Hard picks right up where Live Free or Die Hard left off: John McClane Sr. is still with the NYPD, still has a positive and restored relationship with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and (as dialogue reveals) personally struggles in the era of Barack Hussein Obama II (his job in the NYPD being mediocre).

Coincidentally, the wayward son of A Good Day to Die Hard, meanwhile, has gotten himself in too deep with a Russian political terrorist, Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch). He (the character of Jack McClane) is about to face trial and is wanted dead by Russian terrorists for his involvement with Komarov.

And I think we'd all agree that Jack becomes a blessed man when his father flies all the way from New York City to Russia to rescue him (forget their problems; John Sr. loves his son and is going to risk his life for him). Well, sadly enough for John, he is risking his life for a brat (every bit of sympathy I felt for Jack going into the picture completely disappeared when he first came onscreen.) Forget the solid, Golden Globe and Academy Award-drama that carried the first four films so mightily. The drama we get here is mostly comprised of ""the F-bomb."" There is no equal sympathy or empathy for the characters this time: they are just obnoxious and lack the artistry that Bruce Willis shared with both Bonnie Bedelia and Samuel L. Jackson in the earlier films.

The action, meanwhile, is an impeccable joke: completely unrealistic. Videogame-ish. Sure, I know that in film, there are times when you substitute entertainment for reality and reality for entertainment (I'll give both Willis and Courtney the benefit of the doubt here, as their onscreen relationship mirrors what a real John-Jack McClane relationship would be like). However, with the action, entertainment overshadows reality. With the drama, reality overshadows entertainment. I think we'd all get annoyed by the ""drama"" (okay; Jerry Springer drama), but the action is so unrealistic that a five-year-old could catch onto it.

As for what I meant about Bruce Willis ""losing his freakin' mind,"" a few years ago, he gave an interview about the current Die Hard film (when he knew that it was going to be produced). He said in this interview that he wanted to ""take the p*** out of it (DH)."" That explains the absence of the legendary action and drama that held the original four films...

Next, WTH? was Willis thinking in picking John Moore to succeed Len Wiseman as director?!??!? The guy's only respected film is Behind Enemy Lines!!!!! Doesn't Moore's several flops as a director wave a red flag to picking Moore as the new DH director!??!?!??

Sadly, it didn't, and hopefully Willis learned his lesson from the negative reactions to A Good Day to Die Hard.

Three starts ****only***** for the comedy and soundtrack.",1360886400,,3634,4.778309409888357
5399122,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"""A Good Day to Die Hard"" (2013 release; 97 min.) is the fifth installment in the Die Hard franchinse. Can you believe that 2013 marks the 25th anniversary of the original ""Die Hard"" movie? Where has the time gone! The plot in the latest Die Hard is wafer-thin, something about our hero McClane's son being in a Moscow jail, and our hero going on ""vacation"" to check it out. Need more be said? No!

Several comments: first, if you've seen the trailer for this, as I had several times in past month or so, you knew exactly what to expect in this movie. And that is exactly what the movie delivers (unlike, say, another recent movie ""Broken City"", which promised action in the trailer and proved to be a 'talkie'). The plot of ""A Good Day"" matters not one bit, as far as I'm concerned. What I was hoping for, and got, were over-the-top action sequences. Check out for example early on in the movie the outstanding car chase in Moscow, which truly defies belief as we're seeing it happening on the big screen. Also the concluding action sequence of the movie (involving a huge Russian helicopter) is pretty darn good. I also very much enjoyed the scenery in Moscow, a visit I have visited once many years ago. Looks like a lot has changed there.

If you are looking for art with a capital A, and then are disappointed with this movie, it's a bit like going to a Britney Spears show and being upset you didn't get Mozart music. If on the other hand you are looking for a good action movie, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is exactly what the doctor has ordered. I was surprised how quickly the movie rolled by, and thoroughly enjoyed myself, as long as you don't take any of this too seriously. Relax and joy, yippee ki-yay!",1360886400,4,1712,4.4145569620253164
8548035,3,B00A7ZH8GM,"The digital copy is the extended version of the movie which is supposed to be added scenes. I didn't know they were going to cut my favorite scene of McClane and his daughter. It ties in to the previous movie and there is nice banter as she takes him to the airport. She admonishes him not to make things worse which is funny because you know he is. Instead you just see him exiting a car at the airport and faking two lines of dialogue that were lifted directly from the previous scene. I couldn't really tell where the new scenes were added in on the extended version, although the car chase scenes did seem to go on forever. The DVD was the theatrical version with the original scene intact. I can't speak for the Blu-ray since my player quit working several years ago and I never replaced it because I two other working DVD players. Anyway, I only bought this for the digital copy so I am not happy with the version I got. And while it is definitely the worst of the Die Hard films, it is still Bruce Willis as John McClane and worth watching for that alone.",1530662400,,1062,4.288557213930348

8548041,4,B00A7ZH8GM,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by John Moore, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the Third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Moscow to aid his unruly son, Jack (Jai Courtney), only to discover that Jack is an undercover agent. Father & son team-up to stop a nuclear weapons heist. Sebastian Koch is on hand as a focal point in the heist.

The Die Hard flicks fill the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil."" Thankfully, this installment throws in some entertaining father/son character development in between the wild action sequences. McClanes daughter also appears for good measure (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

The story isn't quite as engaging as ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007), but it was good enough and the action scenes are out of this world, including a long vehicle chase in Moscow in the opening act. Director Moore ups the ante with quick-editing for this one. Some parts are eye-rolling absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone, which sorta helps the viewer go along with the ridiculousness rather than tune out.

The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Thankfully, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" pretty much evades that ditch by giving us entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story. Speaking of the story, one of the highlights is the infamous Russian location of the final act. Another highlight is hottie raven-haired Yuliya Snigir.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Budapest, Hungary, with the Chernobyl scenes done at Old Soviet Air Force Base, Kiskunlachza, Hungary, along with establishing shots of Moscow. WRITERS: Skip Woods.
