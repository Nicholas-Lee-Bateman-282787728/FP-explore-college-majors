4133088,5,B003K7FB7C,"Are there words that can deliver to anyone's ear,  the impact of this film?  I don't think so.  I cried and I laughed and I wondered, what if it had been me?  This was a stirring way to deliver the true tale of barbarism on the part of one set of people and survival and strength of another set of people.  I thank those who put money up to make this film.  I thank those who participated in telling their stories.  I thank the man who started this journey, thus allowing us to know these particular women's  narrative, both the horror they experienced and how they come through it to have rich lives afterward. They do not speak of their lives afterward, but you can tell that they love life and are grateful and appreciative that they lived.  I felt the strength of peace that is in each of them now, in the present, even as they related their history. Very poignant. Thank you. Although I wish this had never happened to anyone, it is better to be the victim of Evil than to be the perpetrator of Evil.  Bless these beautiful women.  Bless all who perished and all who survived this Evil time in our history.",1468195200,57,1111,4.318840579710145

4133096,5,B003K7FB7C,"This is one of the most poignant statement on life in the Nazi concentration camps of eastern Europe I have ever seen. Auschwitz-Birkenau was the infamous place and the narratives are those of six very special Jewish women who survived the horrors of the holocaust by some incredible examples of courage, ingenuity, and intuition. This documentary takes the viewer inside the daily existence of a regimen meant to exhaust, destroy, exploit, and demean the human spirit. Each women interviewed here found her purpose to survive the countless beatings, tortures, deprivations and heartbreaks by learning to help others cope with their own helplessness and not yielding to terror. Each story is accompanied by pictures that graphically reinforce the gruesome and unhappy details as if they had happened yesterday. This presentation is definitely a celebration of life in the midst of death, disease, evil and apocalyptic terror. What kept people alive during this ordeal had to be their ability to dream and long for better days. The memories here, while haunting, appalling, and still very raw, only enhance the moral stature of these six women and countless others as true heroes of modern history. There is an instructive irony in those words ""Work Makes You Free"" that confronted millions of inmates as they walked through the gates of this hellhole decades ago. As one of the interviewees mentioned, what doesn't kill you truly makes you stronger.",1348099200,5,1449,5.196581196581197

These women, who have experienced the unimaginable, still have a twinkle in their eyes and notable senses of humor. It is also worth noting how many times their families had believed that it couldn't happen to them because of political institutions that should have acted as checks. Of course, it did happen.

Each Holocaust survivor should have received a Medal of Freedom or some equivalent long ago as recognition for their endurance in the face of such cruelty and evil. Most if not all are deceased now.

It must be a big industry where they continue to gain a huge amount of shekels in order to push this huge lie.

4133282,3,B003K7FB7C,"Film included graphic pictures, very authentic, very chilling.  However, I felt this film was a showcase for photographs rather than the actual HOW these women survived.  What did each person do to make herself needed and, therefore, safe from the ovens? They spoke eloquently and were interesting to listen to, but I have heard other stories of the things that individuals did which, while not savory, were safety nets.  The women spoke of mental attitudes which held them up but not of any physical actions which might have had the same purpose.  Only one woman did this when she talked about her dressmaking designs and how those designs were noticed (admired?) by a captor. And, what happened when one woman went for a swim in the pool? We did not hear a result of her actions.  I did not want gory details of what people did to ingratiate themselves --- the photographs were gory enough --- but it seems to me to be an interesting topic as to what did those prisoners actually endured to save themselves on a more personal basis.  I understand sharing food, blankets, etc., but those were humanitarian and commendable actions --- there must be something more that each person did.  Maybe it's just me. I simply felt chilled by the pics but not by a sort of bland set of interviews. My apologies to the fine ladies who went through Hell and came out elegant and beautiful.  I do not fault them as they were only answering and talking as the interviewer requested.  What they talked about to each other when the interviewer left the room might be wonderful reading.",1476403200,,1568,4.672727272727273

One day, our only resource will be DVDs of live testimony, as all the survivors will be gone, leaving the door sadly open, for the Deniers to brazenly enter and deny this history. Listening to the survivors, leaves one with deep sense of pain at what these brave people endured and what they lost. The intimate recollections allow you into a world where, if you have not been scorched by the flames, o not presume to come near. We will never truly understand the depths of human degradation and cruelty that these survivors endured, in Auschwitz, nor can we presume to. But listening to these survivors talk so calmly about their ordeals, imparting their knowledge and wisdom, leaves you wanting for more, so that you may go out and teach to anyone and everyone, about this terrible time in Human History.
Although this deals with 6 Jewish survivors, the experiences of the Sinti and Roma (Gypsies), Soviet POWs, Jehovah's Witnesses and political prisoners, shared many cruelties and thousands perished in the gas chambers there. The miracle of the DVD is that there were 6 ordinary people who survived, nay, lived, through this hell, to become successful people after World War 2. I visited Auschwitz -Birkenau this past July 2016, and even with superb docents and outstanding museums, signage etc., there is no way that one can even begin to comprehend the horrors that happened there.

I was amazed at how these women survivors of the Nazi terror were able to remain sane in these hideous conditions.  It is impossible to describe the power of this film to those who have not seen it.  I, as a Bible believing Christian American who is a descendant of Africans brought to this country under deplorable conditions, have always loved Israel and the Jewish people and identified with their suffering and persecution.  Nothing in the annals of human history compare to the systematic and satanic obsession to destroy these people that my belief in the Word of the God of the Bible clearly states are the chosen people of God and Israel was given to them personally by God, Himself.  The Jewish people brought us the knowledge of Jehovah and our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ.  How any nation calling itself ""Christian"" could turn a blind eye and a cold heart to Israel and the Jewish people is a mystery to me and no one who claims to be a true, born-again Bible believing Christian could not love these people through whom God chose to reveal Himself to a world that would never have known Him!.",1471824000,3,1196,4.644549763033176

The video brought the viewer alongside the women who shared their memories of sadness, courage, humor and endurance when they faced  incomprehensible evil.  Their introduction to Aushchwitz and the men and women guards, was first, the ripping away of their loved ones, second, the purposeful demand their nakedness in order to strip off their dignity, third head shaving to further humiliate, worse to hand the women ill-fitting dresses, clothing without thought for the cold weather. One woman received an evening gown. None received underwear.  I especially liked the account of the courage and spunk of one of the women who on a hot day, jumped into the Nazi's swimming pool and swam without a thought for consequences if caught.

The women that were interviewed had very good memories of what happened and draw you in to the story like you were there or that it just happened. The only reason that I gave it four stars, is that the people that made the movie seemed to slow it down at times and during some of the scenes, they lost the connection between the narrative and the pictures/video. It is very graphic and I would not recommend this for young children. It does tell a side of the war that many suspected, but few ever spoke of; the freeing of the camps by the Russians and how they poorly they treated the freed prisoners.

4133647,5,B003K7FB7C,Get out the tissue and weep for mankind.  Only those who were there and survived can tell what they saw and personally experienced.  Everybody has a different story of survival.  It is amazing that so many of the survivors were able to have a somewhat normal life after being liberated.  Has anybody heard any accounts from soldiers who under orders committed atrocities?  Do they have nightmares?  Are they full of remorse?  It is beyond ones comprehension what went on there and the genocide that is going on all over the world at this time and we are blinded to it because it is not happening to us.  God save humanity from itself.,1469404800,,634,4.598214285714286

When all was lost and brutality a minute to minute occurrence they survived and went on to thrive.  Simply an amazing journey revealed by these gracious, intelligent and strong women.

I can't put my finger on what it is that makes me feel this way as their lives certainly were just as brutually horrible as were the lives of the people in the other documentaries. But, something about this one just doesn't show the rawness and the pure horror & brutallity about the whole situation. It doesn't make a person really ""feel""those feelings. The women who told their stories were very courageous & each of them survived using all the strength & survival skills they had.

Anyway, this is not a superbly constructed documentary, but the narratives of the six female survivors are a must-watch. They are incredible women and their stories are ones we should never forget. Make sure you have a lot of tissue with you. There are surprising bits of humor that offer some relief when listening to their nightmarish experiences. This humor I think reflects the incredible strength of the human spirit survivors were able to somehow tap into.

I also think the documentary was poorly titled. While it was interesting to learn that Auschwitz had a swimming pool for its guards and their families, it only related to one of the woman's experiences. I suppose the filmmaker probably thought of the title as a metaphor, but it's a weak one.

It is a 57 minute documentary about a variety of women from different backgrounds and countries and their personal journey surviving the Holocaust. SPOILER ALERT - Only one reference is made to swimming in the German's pool. I never saw the theme of the title in the story.

I found the facts about the different country's cultures and populations interesting. I was not aware that Hungary was basically anti-Semetic. I was shocked to learn of the statistics regarding survival rates among women and children. Most of all, it was educational and uplifting. Hearing the lilting laughter and the authentic accounts delivered in such a neutral manner was refreshing. I am so glad these brave women learned what they needed to do to survive, and emerged knowing that their attitude and acceptance was a key to making it out alive. Mostly I was struck by the amount of gratitude they had for EVERYTHING that was presented to them. This film helped me shift my attitude to one of empowering myself to keep on. The ending was a little weak. I went back to the beginning to remember who was from what country and what family. Did they know each other at Aushchwitz? It would add to the documentary to see which family members survived, and where are they or their surviving family members now? I have often heard that gratitude is the attitude for success. They are living proof. I hope they continue to remember the wonderful part of their lives and let the horrible events evaporate from their memories. Impossible, yes, but these women seem to have created a healing within themselves. They also reminded me of how important it is to be with others that one can call a 'family'. My mother, the last member of my family, recently passed away.
