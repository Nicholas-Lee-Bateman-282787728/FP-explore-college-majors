8425766,2,B004DO49Y2,"Same material is in Mr McCarthy's Rock Guitar Mega Pack (which is an excellent tutorial) and the material is much better organized and explained there as well. In this one he presents the 5 minor pentatonic scale shapes merely by playing them without any context...of course he says, ""You have to know all of them because this is where your solos will come from."" Basically, it's left for the student to mine away at the scales. That can be good, but not for a beginner. There is a section of licks that really are glossed over and ultimately packaged up in a canned solo over a I-IV-V rhythm (A-D-E) that is practical only for a more advanced player. It's unfortunate to write this review as Mr McCarthy is a monster player and is a very good teacher as evidenced by his Rock Guitar Mega Pack. Sorry, but take a pass on this one.",1451260800,,830,4.431372549019608
8425767,1,B004DO49Y2,"As the title suggests, this 3-DVD megapack does not meet my expectations at all.  I was very hopeful to gain a solid foundation in the structure of the blues and that the lessons would provide me with a number of tools that I can use right away.  Unfortunately, it is poorly taught and illogically presented.

First, there is absolutely no logic in the sequence of topics presented. It is as if random concepts came to mind during the filming, and the crew just ran with it.  There is material in the beginner dvd that is clearly beyond the reach of even upstart players, and there is material on the advanced dvd that should have been discussed at the foundation (beginner) level...like the actual structure of the 12-bar blues progression.

Secondly, the quality of filming is amateurish.  There are places where the camera zooms in on the fretboard but cannot keep up with the left hand moving up and down the neck.  And the setting looks like something out of an Austin Powers movie....only this guy thinks it's really cool.

Thirdly, when a new lick or phrase is introduced,  It is not demonstrated first.  Instead, a tedious breaking down of the content comes first and then it is demomstrated at the end. In my opinion, licks should be demonstrated before and after they are broken down.  Otherwise, all the effort of taking the lick apart doesn't mean anythingif you haven't evn heard the lick yet.

The instructor also ""improvised"" solos based on the blues scale that serve little purpose.  There is no tab for the solos that I am aware of, and I don't know of any beginner or intermediate guitarist who can improvise with the speed and dexterity of his examples.  I also don't remember seeing anything to assist with soloing against chord changes or with moving keys around (although I'll admit that I sped through the final dvd since it was clearly not for me).

Overall, I would recommend that you pass on this one, and look elsewhere.  There are some really well taught lessons out there by others.  This instructor is a good player but poor teacher.",1389052800,2,2063,4.701949860724234
