8321597,3,B001MS52GG,I love tango al reves.  I like this disc.  but just like some people like lite beer and love real beer.  good but not filling.  heavy into entry into al reves. but very skimpy on moves in al reves.  leaves me thinking that a second disc showing more moves was thought about but never realized.  This is the ONLY disc on tango el reves out there.  if you are not a fan of this style don't buy this disc.  long beach ca,1396396800,,417,4.0
8321598,5,B001MS52GG,"This DVD gives you a great introduction to Tango in Shadow Position. Everything is explained in an easy to understand fashion, in a logical and progressive format (assuming you have good tango fundamentals/basic skills).
Working this material will definately make you a better dancer as it really refines the lead/follow skills.
I cannot wait to see Vol. 2 available.",1323216000,,367,5.237288135593221
