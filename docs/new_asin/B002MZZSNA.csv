I went to the school she owns for years. let me tell you she follows nothing that she is talking about in these videos. The amount of cruelty at that school would shock most people.
I feel that these videos are a waste of time, do to the fact that I know that the person giving these lectures can't even follow her own advice.",1476921600,,427,4.035294117647059
8374405,5,B002MZZSNA,"These DVD's give parents the answers they have been looking for when raising a child. The steps are very simple and give a parent a way not to be frustrated or loose their temper when a kid acts up. This also helps the child regain confidence and not feel they are just a kid to be pushed around but a person who can make their own decisions in life. I would highly recommend these to any parent.

8374406,5,B002MZZSNA,"Ms. Reeder's DVD set is a must have for any parent who wants to take the guesswork out of raising a child to be a happy, responsible and educated adult.  Into the sea of confusion that modern parenting has become, the presented information in this set arms a parent with the necessary tools to do the job.  If you want to make sure that the child who loves you now, will continue to love you always, order, watch and use this DVD set:  I am so very glad I did.",1253145600,,460,4.088888888888889
8374407,5,B002MZZSNA,"I am a single parent of a 13 year old daughter. When she was about a year or so old I attended a seminar that changed my life as a parent. The seminar was given by Yoka Reeder . It simplified my life forever and made raising my daughter SO much easier. She hsa turned into an incredible, young woman as a result.  The beauty of having this series of lectures by Yoka is you can listen to them over and over and really get what she is saying and apply it to your family and other children.  It is an amazing product and should be required study for all parents.  Believe me, it will make your life as a parent so much easier and create a lot more time for a whole lot of lovin' with your kids. And THAT is what it is all about!!",1253145600,,727,3.931972789115646
8374408,5,B002MZZSNA,"I have known of Yoka's success for almost 30 years. I had the pleasure of meeting with her in 1999. Since then I have attended a seminar presented by her and have had many personal conversations with her in regards to my son. Her insight into the world of a child is a gift. Her practical applications of the humanitarian, L. Ron Hubbards writings on children are positively brilliant. I can highly recommend this DVD and can't wait to get my own copy.

8374409,5,B002MZZSNA,"I love these DVD's!!!! Yoka has a gentle patience about her and I would enjoy listening to her talk on any subject. We are so lucky to get so many years of her expericence boiled down to 3 DVD's. With each viewing my communication skills with kids improve. This is especially valuable to me as I make my living by tutoring children.

I have loaned these DVD's to others and they loved them too. I highly recommend them!",1253059200,2,419,4.371794871794871
