8574678,4,B00BWAOSUU,"Charley Patton is a guy worth getting to know. He is recognized as one of the originators of the Delta Blues. He had a unique personal style.  Since Patton played both in standard an open tunings, this is like two lessons in one.  You get to study Patton's licks in E,A and C, his slide moves in open G and D, and his distinctive strum. Tom Feldmann has learned Patton's repertoire inside out and breaks them down in a digestible manner.  He also plays the snot out of them.  The only downside is that Tom doest speak 'music', so you would need to fill in your own understanding about what Patton was doing.  Even with this caveat, this and Feldman's Skip James lesson are 2 of my favorites the SGGW catalog.",1494201600,,708,4.374045801526718
