Is the grocery store scene included?  Does THAT make it worth $80.  ?  The film is a classic , Playfair loses his fight against the evil of the world, becomes Holmes, seeking Moriarty, the arch criminal, (( who probably is the one who deleted the scene)).  Fight against the real and unreal idiots/fears /buffoons/ politicians/religionists/beliefs/ that seek to deny our happiness/success/creations.  Only three stars, because of the lacking scene, ridiculous price gouging.",1505952000,2,632,5.1683168316831685
8706152,5,B00UGPTUMI,"Moreover, we get to search for Moriarty together with the real duo of George C. Scott and Joanne Woodward.

It appears that Justin Playfair (George C. Scott) things he is Sherlock Holmes. An investigation by Dr. Mildred Watson (Joanne Woodward) may prove he is Holmes and she is really the Dr. Watson. On their mission to find their elusive archenemy, Professor Moriarty, they barely pass by one of his traps in a supermarket. Watch as Holmes makes a unique diversion. In the process, we may learn a little bit about ourselves.

I am rooting for them and you will be.

Do not think the film is just carried by two actors. You may find some of our other favorites in this film.
