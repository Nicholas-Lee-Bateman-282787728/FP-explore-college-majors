8710748,4,B00VNQWTNG,"A decent documentary but with a definite liberal bias. Not sure it's entirely accurate. Should see this after watching ""Mumbai Massacre"" (Secrets of the Dead).",1515456000,,159,5.4
8710749,5,B00VNQWTNG,"City of Darby, in Northern England has served as a hub for terrorist activity with a very prevalent second, third generation of Pakistani community with strong connection to Pakistan. Through their lineage, Pakistanis are actually entitled to Pakistani citizenship, therefore ease of travel becomes straight forward so does recruiting of terrorist. After Mumbai attack, Headley headed to Derby, to find support for his Denmark plot of taking the editors of Jyllands-Posten newspaper hostage, beheading them and throwing their heads off the roof since they had published cartoons of the prophet Mohammad. British alerted the Americans about Headley but unfortunately US intelligence agencies never connected the dots although NSA had all Headleys emails. Regardless America took credit for what English knew.

In this ninety minute documentary, with correspondence Sebastian Rotellas reporting and producer Thomas Jenning directing, you will get to witness the scale of planning that terrorist go through to plot a single terror on Planet Earth. America is an island and away from others with population where no city like Derby would ever become reality but for Europe with all their immigration issues that they are facing especially in Mediterranean Sea, one should wonder how much intelligence gathering can prevent such acts that we have been witnessing lately. The sad part is as long as we have individuals in the US who do not value human life and support prison unions for millions of dollars in campaign funding and voting then the American working class will end up with more terrorist that they will need room and board till their death in prison if not taken out through death penalty. These scum bags are willing to live in isolation 23 hours a day as long as they do not have to face death penalty, properly and quickly. This guy, David Coleman Headley is in prison and the Boston Bomber will join him since those Bostonians with those attorneys with no value for innocent American lives, will go to the rescue of these murderers. With poverty and financial inequality growing, there is a guaranteed production of these worthless souls regardless of their geographical location. Superb reporting.
