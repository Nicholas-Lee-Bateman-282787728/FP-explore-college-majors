8180565,5,B0000897BN,"San Francisco filmmaker Burroughs has struck paydirt with his improv method of filmmaking. Check out the dvd improv Outtakes to see the process.  He takes no credit for writing a script because there is none...that is what REAL improv is about.
Altman, Cassavetes...all the other improv directors don't have the confidence to really let Improv fly that Burroughs has. The film is funny because the story and actors are funny. Comparing  old style filmmaking with a script and this truly improvisational approach, is like comparing mechanical drawing and abstract art...  Burroughs is the Jackson Pollock of  filmmaking.  The entire film has a unique, innocent, unscripted, feel. I can't wait until his new feature SECURITY comes out on DVD.",1053388800,4,740,5.237288135593221
