426025,5,6302120527,"Captain Blood is the kind of movie that I like to pop in the VCR on a Saturday afternoon when I need a couple of hours of down time.  Errol Flynn stars as Peter Blood, a doctor wrongly imprisoned who turns to piracy in  the seventeenth century.  Flynn was the perfect actor for a role like this,  because he had the athleticism and charisma to make this character come  alive, and he manages to deliver some ""goofy"" dialogue without  making it sound ""goofy"".  Olivia deHavilland plays his love  interest (as she often did), and she's well cast as the proper, yet spunky  young lady.  It's hard to imagine a couple of actors more suited for each  other.  Physically, they look incredible together, and the chemistry  between them is obvious.  Their youth and energy keep the film moving, as  do the well-directed action sequences, the rousing musical score, and the  playful humour.  There are a lot of familiar character actors in the cast,  including the always great Basil Rathbone.  Captain Blood is the kind of  movie you don't get tired of watching, because it entertains every time.",948931200,28,1088,4.747311827956989
426026,5,6302120527,"every month I check my primestar guide to see if this classic is on AMC or TCM . I can see this movie over and over and never tire of peter blood's charming wit and dashing smile. I love movies that make me feel good and  this,by far,is my ""pick me up when i'm feelin' blue"" movie! I  also love ""the mark of zorro"" and would say the two are neck and  neck for swashbuckler who stole my heart! I HIGHLY encourage all flynn  fan's to buy as I have searched for years for this movie!",944956800,,480,3.96875
426027,4,6302120527,"This breathlessly exuberant film is a magnificent example of what Hollywood can't make anymore, TRUE ENTERTAINMENT. For those of us who are not spoiled by the billion$ studios shell out to today's pretentious,  wastrel directors, who feed off of the vicious ""bloodlust circle""  they've trapped the world in, ""Captain Blood's"" modest budget is  never evident, nor important, due to a masterful job of filling the screen  with personalities, bravura, suspense, and rousing action by Hollywood  professionals. Director Michael Curtiz, perhaps the supreme master at  screen movement, derives boundless enthusiasm from his actors; cuts and  choreographs the action beautifully; and balances the whole business  delightfully tongue-in-cheek. Errol Flynn contributes with a legendary  star-making effort, atoning for his inexperience with confidence, lungs,  athleticism, and magnetic charm. A few slightly dated characterizations  among the supporting cast are also redeemed by performers giving it their  all. Assisting all this are award-winning cameramen, set designers, and  musicians; some absolutely brilliant model work (the sea battles are no  ""bathtub"" affairs!); and a marvelous, ironic ending.  ""Captain Blood"" stands the test of time as a monument of energy,  graphic skill, and good old-fashioned entertainment! (For more  recommendations of similar films, see my reviews for ""The Adventures  of Robin Hood,"" ""The Sea Hawk,"" and ""Angels With Dirty  Faces,"" all at Amazon!)",930960000,4,1479,5.859154929577465
426028,5,6302120527,"This film was a first on many counts -- Flynn's first collaboration with director Michael Curtiz and costars Olivia deHavilland Basil Rathbone, his first movie scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and his first notable  ""swashbuckling"" movie.  It was released in 1935 -- 64 years ago  at this writing -- so of course, in some respects, it seems dated, as well  as less than subtle.  But if you overlook these forgiveable defects,  remember that this movie is first and foremost meant to be undemanding  entertainment, and lose yourself in the magic of Flynn's screen presence,  apparent even then, his chemistry with deHavilland (only 19 at the time),  his ability to deliver the hokiest line with ringing sincerity, and some  fighting scenes that Warner Bros. apparently thought highly enough of to  re-use in the later, much more sophisticated ""Sea Hawk,"" you  can't help but be carried away by the movie's spirit.  In that respect, it  is simply ageless.",928454400,5,955,5.038461538461538
426029,5,6302120527,"This has become my favorite movie in my favorite movie genre; pirates.  One can't help but be swept away by Mr. Flynn and Ms. Dehaviland in this wonderful pirate adventure.  Once a mild mannered physician hoping but to  cure the sick, he becomes a slave under none other than King James, sent to  the Carribean to serve his sentence.  Having fallen in love with Olivia, he  escapes his captors to become the most notorious pirate of his day but, in  true Flynn fashion, a notorious pirate with a terrific set of ethics.  If I  watched this movie another 100 times, I'd still fight by his side and be  surprised by the remarkably upbeat ending which, by the way, does involve  the most beautiful mademoiselle.  This is by far my favorite pirate movie.  To paraphrase a country song ""I shoulda been a pirate"".  How  'bout you?",911865600,2,824,4.586206896551724
426030,5,6302120527,"In his autobiography, Jack L. Warner said Errol Flynn's sudden rise to stardom was like a ""wildfire"" sweeping across the landscape. In ""Captain Blood,"" a 26-year-old Errol Flynn burst on the scene with drop-dead good looks, a knack for generating excitement, and one of the most powerful screen personas of any star in the history of film. This story of a doctor-turned-pirate is rousing entertainment from beginning to end, and represents a milestone for both Flynn and Warner Brothers. For Flynn, the movie made him an international star. For Warner Brothers, it gave them their first matinee idol and one of their biggest income-producers. ""Captain Blood"" also began the wonderful partnership of Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, who would go on to make another six films together. NOTE: Beware of 99-minute versions of ""Captain Blood."" At all costs, get the full, 119-minute version. It's like a whole different film.  END",891648000,21,922,5.1879194630872485

426086,5,6302120527,"One of the fine old Warner Bros. action/adventure flicks from the 1930s, set in the 1780s.  An honest country doctor, Peter Blood (Errol Flynn) is caught on the wrong side tending to a wounded traitor against the king, James II.  His punishment is to be shipped to the West Indies to be sold into slavery, where he is bought for the bargain price of ten Pounds by the Lord Governor's free-spirited daughter, played by Olivia de Haviland.  After that ""meet cute"" anything that can happen, does, and so as not to introduce spoilers let me merely say Blood comes by the title ""Capitan"" honestly, since he has a ship under his command!

CAPTAIN BLOOD was a huge success and the first pairing of Flynn and de Haviland as antagonists/lovers, a situation they would repeat in such other Warner Bros. classics as THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS on.  At the risk of sounding trite, CAPTAIN BLOOD is the type of movie they don't make anymore, with no deep politics, social commentary or gender-bending going on, just good family adventure.  This movie is part of the ""Warner Night at the Movies"" disc, which includes a newsreel, cartoon, coming attraction and introduction by Leonard Maltin.

426128,5,6302120527,"One of the cinema's greatest pairings was of Errol Flynn with Olivia de Havilland. Captain Blood was the first of eight movies the charismatic pair made together. Considering this film was made in 1935 it has stood the test of time.
Note: the scene with Captain Bloods ship fighting the French ships was very realistic. It was early swashbuckling and cinematography at its best.
NO other actor could have played physician turned swashbuckling pirate Peter Blood, but Errol Flynn. He was made for the role.
Flynn was 26 and Miss De Havilland was a luminously beautiful nineteen years old.
The chemistry between the two is tangible and it makes the emotional scenes between them all the better.
The character actors who were in quite a few a Errol Flynn's movies were outstanding.
That old saying ""they don't make them like that anymore"" is sadly so true.
After viewing this as a child and now watching it all these years later was a real treat.
I advice all the lovers of the golden age of film to watch Captain Blood. It's a rare treat.",1499558400,4,1036,4.666666666666667

You absolutely can't take your eyes off of him when he's onscreen, and when you add Olivia DeHavilland into the mix (sexual chemistry for days!), you have an absolutely fabulous film.  I recently sat my 20-year-old daughter down to watch this, and 30 seconds into Flynn's first appearance on the screen, she was transfixed.  ""Oh.....OH.... Oh my god.  THAT FACE....Oh, LOOK at him!!!""  Uh, YEAH.  Bearing in mind when it was made, the special effects even stand up pretty well all things considered.  It takes a surprisingly long time by contemporary standards to get to the ""piratey"" part of the movie, but it's worth the wait.  And honestly, it's not exactly a hardship to stare at Errol and Olivia for an hour or so before getting to the swashbuckling.  My daughter's other observation was to ask if Cary Elwes was channeling Errol Flynn in ""The Princess Bride""!  Well I don't know, but Errol did it first and best!",1468627200,,1011,4.661016949152542

426421,4,6302120527,"A lot of lists of the best Pirate movies put Captain Blood number one and I won't deny its a good film. On the other hand its darn near impossible to grade a film produced in 1935 to movies like Pirates of the Caribbean. They are completely different animals.

For a film produced 80 years ago I was very impressed. Obviously its black and white but it does have sound. There is a lot of overacting which is standard for the era and the sets often look very much likes sets. On the other hand there were some sets that were quite impressive and it was obvious that was money spent. They were able to afford scenes with huge groups of extras and the movie contained some surprisingly effective model work.

The first half of the film is generally very accurate to the book. In the movie Peter Blood is a bit cleverer and more in control. For instance in the book one of the doctors on Barbados suggests a plan for Bloods escape whereas in the movie Blood approaches the doctor convincing him to help escape. It's in the second half where the movie does a significant amount of rearrangement of events and in several cases multiple characters are combined into one. Having read the book I didn't love all the changes and if they were trying to streamline the story I would have cut more from the long, slow first half. For someone who hasn't read the book I think the movie narrative would likely work quite well.

Captain Blood is a sanitized look at pirating but I have to say that the final battle between Captain Blood's ship and several French ships was brutal and thrilling. There wasn't blood and gore (which really wouldn't work in a black and white film) but there was a ton of death and destruction as the ships utterly pounded each other to splinters. This was a surprisingly effective scene given the limitations of 1935 film making but is a testament to practical effects. At first I wasn't loving Errol Flynn's sometimes cheesy performance but he has an infectious personality that really grew on me. For a film from the 1930's I give this one high marks.

I'm writing this review out of disappointment with the many analog/film visual artifacts (scratches, blemishes, etc) that today's digital tools can eradicate with multiple, different methods.  I expected WB to have done this on a classic film they've been milking for 80 years.  I started to wonder if copyright laws had been allowed to expire as intended that a fan such as myself, many of us maybe, might have cleaned these imperfections out.  Hell, we could also replace those pitiful studio landscape/seascape backdrops.

Captain Blood is comfort food to me.

I'm not looking to colorize it, though I'm not opposed to it.  But if WB is to continue to profit decades after the original copyright was intended to expire.  I expect them to earn it by at least cleaning out the slightly distracting film blemishes.  I'm now disinclined to buy any more classic HD content.  Instead, I'll look to upscaled DVDs at a fraction the cost.  Perhaps Amazon might flex its muscle to tag classics as digitally cleaned vs. digitally captured (raw).",1434240000,5,1113,4.830687830687831

  Basil Rathbone who also plays in this movie along with Errol Flynn were both sword masters ( expert swordsmen ) and when it came time for their confrontation ( fight scene ), the director simply told them who was supposed to win and who was supposed to loose the sword fight. Outside of that, the two of them were left alone to work out the details as they fought it out.

426769,3,6302120527,"I watched this with my daughter as she was reading the book. As with most movies based on great literary works, this one is pretty one-dimensional compared to the book. Blood's personality and depth are only superficially captured, although I suppose shortening Sabatini's book to 2 hours (or is it less? I did not time it) doesn't permit full character development. I am wondering why the movie makers did not have Errol Flynn adopt an Irish brogue accent - Sabatini took such pains to convey this characteristic in the book! De Havilland's Arabella was somewhat inconsistent with the book as well. She seems to be flirting with Blood from the moment they met, and she is flighty into the bargain, but this does not fit Sabatini's description of Arabella's character. Also, taking the artistic license to have Blood and Levasseur fight over Arabella instead of Governor d'Ogeron's (of Tortuga) children and the removal of Lord Julian Wade's character impoverished the story considerably.  Overall, this movie was a bit of a disappointment.

426940,5,6302120527,"And that's just what we do, too--follow Errol Flynn as he embarks upon the signature role of his swashbuckling career.  This was Errol Flynn's first major film, and it set the standard for pirate epics for over 20 years. Even Flynn himself did not surpass this performance in like films over the years that followed.  We see the passion that the young Flynn brings to the screen as an idealistic doctor, a rebellious slave, and finally, as an able, cunning, and caring pirate.

The only criticism of the DVD that I have is that such a film should have been colorized during the re-mastering process.  I know that the impact of black-and-white can also be visually stunning as well as representative of a ground-breaking era of film, but the costumes and action scenes cry for color to be fully appreciated.  Flynn's voice seemed to be slightly muted in the early scenes, too.

Other than that, the film is a rollicking good time--filled with action and witty dialogue delivered by consummate professionals.  Lionel Atwill and Basil Rathbone are villains par excellence--one knows that Rathbone and Flynn will eventually cross swords, but just where and when is a surprise.  The onscreen chemistry between Errol Flynn  and Olivia De Havilland cannot be denied; it is as magnetic as the onscreen relationship between John Wayne and Maureen O' Hara.  Supporting actors such as Henry Stephenson and Flora Robson round out this magnificent film souffl and help to  make it the true classic that it is.  Buy this together with The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), and you will truly have Errol Flynn at his best.",1377043200,2,1606,4.885608856088561

This 1935 movie is very high quality for its time and could hold its own against movies made today.  The plot  has Doctor Blood, being unfairly sentenced by a corrupt judge for unjust charges of being ""a rebel against the king"". However, his life is spared, and he is sent to Port Royal, Jamaica, to be sold as a slave.  After escaping, he is a pirate and becomes Captain of a pirate ship.

Take for example the classic, ""The Count of Monte Christo"", a beautiful story, with dramatically written scences.

Directed by Michael Curtiz

The quintessential swashbuckler. Irish doctor Dr. Peter Blood (Flynn) is wrongly sentenced to deportation and slavery to the Caribbean. He plans an escape and now seeking vengeance forms an alliance with the French buccaneer Capt. Levasseur (Bathbone). However during their reign of piracy they capture Arabella Bishop (Olivia de Havilland) and Blood's feelings are betrayed when he challenges Levasseur over her.

Atwill played many a screen villain, but I'm not sure he was ever better as the pompous blundering oaf Colonel Bishop. My favorite scene is when Flynn routs out the Spanish pirate attack on Port Royal by seizing the pirate ship. When Atwill comes on board to thank those who turned the tables on the pirates he gets quite a reception. The dialog in this scene and the final result of this oaf being tossed into the harbor is priceless.

Quintessential Flynn in his ""breakout"" role is outstanding and a fabulous Eric Wolfgang Korngold score that still rings true today.

Special mention goes out to Basil Rathbone, flawlessly cast as a French corsair.

(Warner Brothers, 1935)
------------------------------
My kid is into pirates this month so I went on a search for some classic Hollywood pirate movies to watch before our big swashbuckling sortie on Halloween. I thought I'd start with some old Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power, but it's been a while since I'd seen those films so it was time for a refresher course... As it turns out, ""Captain Blood,"" although a fine film, is a bit too harsh in tone for a very young child.  One of Flynn's earliest lead roles, it is the pseudo-historical story of ""Peter Blood"" a medical doctor-turned-pirate whose persona was very loosely modeled on the real-life Thomas Blood, an infamous figure in English history best known for his 1671 theft of the royal jewels. The film is a classic Depression-era potboiler, with a simplistic view of history revolving around a wickedly ""bad"" English King (James II) and his nasty colonial minions. Totally silly, but good clean fun.

The parts that are actually disturbing are the harsh, relatively realistic depictions of slavery and indentured servitude at the film's start, with men being bought like cattle, bound to the stocks, flogged and even branded on their faces. In the second half of the film, after Flynn and his merry band of rebels escape their prison island, things lighten up and Flynn's more familiar bon vivant adventurer persona comes into clearer focus.  All in all, it was an enjoyable film but as I say, maybe not right for a little kid still new to movies that don't feature animated characters.  For now, I think we'll stick to ""The Princess Bride."" :-) (Axton)",1286496000,,1626,4.901818181818181
427207,4,6302120527,"The Times
In 1935 the Great Depression was coming to an end thanks to President Franklin D Roosevelt. Unions were being formed (though not recognised as forms of labour organisations) and people, mainly women, were beginning to get more rights.
Studios began making bigger budget films and every major studio produced a film a week. Period Dramas were the most successful films and Gangster films were being phased out after the Production Code was introduced in 1934 by disgruntled citizens. Censorship became a major part of Hollywood and many ambitious directors were put out of work. The Code caused a lot of innovation and experimentation in films to die out and controversy in films were scarce. This `Code of Ethics' prevented studios from creativity in films and also crushed many director's free enterprises. A lot of works were cut down so much that directors refused to have their names in the credits or that (in non-fiction) films falsified information. Although it was a major violation of free media, films still found ways to break the boundaries.

Synopsis
Dr Peter Blood (Errol Flynn) is a veteran of two wars, but has settled down in the English town of Bridgewater as a physician for many years. As a man of peace, Blood has saved many men and always sticks to his oath of serving any man who needs help. In 1685 Blood is arrested as a rebel sympathiser by King James II of England for treating a wounded rebel. Blood denies the charges at his trial and says that ""his quarrel was not with the man's politics, but rather with his wounds"".
Blood is sentenced to slavery along with many other rebels, and is sent to Port Royal to be sold. Blood is examined by Colonel Bishop (Lionel Atwill), and when he refuses to open his mouth for examination, Bishop beats him. As Blood is about to be bought to work in the mines, Ms Arabella Bishop, the Colonel's niece (Olivia DeHavilland), buys him to save him from a horrible fate in the mines.
Blood works as a slave for Bishops plantation, but eventually becomes the Governor's (George Hassell) personal physician. Blood becomes in good standing with the governor when Blood saves him from gout. The governor's previous physicians (Hobart Cavanaugh and Donald Meek) get out of a job and lose respect, so they offer to pay for a boat to help Blood and his fellow slaves escape.
The night of the escape, Spanish pirates attack the Port and sink their ship, so Blood and the other men take the Spanish ship. In order to congratulate the heroes who saved Port Royal, Colonel Bishop appoints himself governor and arrives at the boat. Blood throws Bishop overboard and the men begin to sail off, beginning their lives as honest pirates. Their code, `hurt no woman', `attack only the English ship', `each man who loses a limb in battle gets extra loot' and `kill as little people as possible'. Bishop swears that he will never rest until he has Blood, and undergoes a desperate manhunt.
Blood signs a partnership with fellow pirate, Captain Levasseur (Basil Rathbone), a ruthless French cut throat. Levasseur captures Arabella and an English emissary named Lord Willoughby (Henry Stephenson), and Blood offers to pay their ransom so that he might take them to safety. Levasseur refuses and he attacks Blood. After a brief duel, Captain Blood kills Levasseur and takes Ms Bishop and Lord Willoughby onto his ship.
Blood decides to take the two to Port Royal, but as they approach they notice French warships attacking the harbour. Lord Willoughby has been desperately seeking a conference with Blood, and as they sit out at sea he tells Blood his decree that the king has stricken him and all his men from slavery, forgiven all their pirating and has offered posts in his navy for all of Bloods men. Blood and his members laugh at the idea until they discover that King James II is not king and the new king William II of Orange, has realised that they were all good men unjustly accused and put into slavery. The men cheer and Blood proposes to take Port Royal back from the French for England and for good King William, in which his crew heartily agrees.
After a large battle, Blood destroys one ship and seizes the other and Port Royal is safe once more. Willoughby appoints Blood as the new governor and begins an investigation into Bishop for abandoning his post at war time and taking all his ships on an unsanctioned hunt for Blood.
Blood and Arabella start a relationship and Bishop is allowed to live by Blood, but is humiliated greatly that he is saved by his enemy.

Review
This film is one of the greatest examples of contracted films. The film was made by contract director Michael Curtiz (who had a very European style to his films) and included many contracted actors who were all very talented even in bit roles. The music for the film gives it a great advantage over other films of its days because many films had not incorporated music with their films as yet. The camera angles are amazing, and the use of shadows makes the film interesting in even the dullest of scenes.

Making Of
Captain Blood was a gamble for Warner Bros. After the success of `The Count of Monte Cristo', Warner Bros decided to make their own swashbuckling film, but most of the stars were unavailable. Robert Donat turned down the role and Brian Aherne was busy, so Warner Bros cast an entirely unknown actor in the main role of Captain Blood, Errol Flynn.
The film was relatively expensive despite the fact that no full sized ships were actually built. Many of the battle scenes were from the 1924 film `The Sea Hawk' and a lot of the films prosperity rode on the two unknown actors Flynn and DeHavilland.
For the duel scenes between Flynn and Rathbone, Rathbone (an experienced fencer) had to `go easy' on Flynn. Rathbone was a more superior fighter than Flynn even 3 years later when they had to duel in `The Adventures of Robin Hood'.
Errol Flynn was so nervous during this film that his first two weeks of shots were re-filmed after he had gained his confidence.
For the scoring, composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold had only 3 weeks to compose an entire score. Korngold would work on a Paramount Operetta in the days and at nights would compose the score for Captain Blood.
Captain Blood was a great success and made a star out of Flynn and DeHavilland, who later made 8 more films together.

Cast & Crew
Michael Curtiz, the director: Michael Curtiz was a Hungarian director who made more classics as a contracted director than other film maker. He is responsible for such films as `20,000 Years In Sing Sing' (1932 with Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis), `Doctor X' (1932 with Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Arthur Edmund Carewe), `Mystery of the Wax Museum' (1933 with Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Holmes Herbert and Arthur Edmund Carewe), `The Charge of the Light Brigade' (1936 with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland and David Niven), `The Adventures of Robin Hood' (1938 with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone), `Four Daughters' (1938 with John Garfield and Claude Rains. Curtiz was nominated for an Academy Award), `Angels with Dirty Faces' (1938 with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart), `Dodge City' (with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland and Ann Sheridan), `Yankee Doodle Dandy' (1942 with James Cagney and Walter Huston. Curtiz was nominated for an Academy Award), `Casablanca' (1942 with Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt and Claude Rains for which Curtiz won the Academy Award for Best Director), `Mildred Pierce' (1945 with Joan Crawford and Jack Carson) and `White Christmas' (1954 with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) just to name a few! Curtiz always knew how to get the best out of a performer, and worked on over 170 films in 50 years. Curtiz was born in 1886 in Hungary and started making films in Europe in 1912. He moved to the USA in 1926 where he became Warner Bros most valuable contracted director purely because he could film anything, any genre, so Warner Bros gave him many projects (basically all the projects that had no director or was turned down by others). Curtiz became renowned enough to eventually sign a new contract with Warner Bros where he got to choose the films he made (in about 1931). He continued to direct pictures at a slower pace in the 50's after he decided not to renew a contract with Warner Bros. Curtiz (with his thick Hungarian accent and meticulous behaviour) made many enemies with his crew, especially Errol Flynn (who worked with Curtiz 12 times!). Other than his amazing talent in filming, Curtiz also fought for Austria-Hungary in WWI and adopted a son in 1929. Curtiz was extremely strict on his films, and didn't let actors leave until he had the shot he wanted. On the set of Casablanca, actor Claude Rains hid an alarm clock on the set that went off at lunch time. When the alarm went off Curtiz was in the middle of shooting and Rains simply stopped and said, ""My god!! I think it's lunchtime!"". All the actors refused to continue until they got lunch, and Michael Curtiz threw one of his famous tantrums. Curtiz was one of the most respected directors on the Warner Lot and was fond friends with Jack L Warner, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains (who were all highly influential actors at Warner Bros). Curtiz's accent made it hard for people to understand him, and once when (during the filming of Casablanca) Curtiz decided a scene needed a poodle, the crew quickly got him a poodle dog only to find out that he wanted a `poodle' of water! Curtiz was a very exuberant personality right up until his death in 1962.

Errol Flynn as Dr Peter Blood: Errol Flynn was born in Tasmania in 1909 and was a rebel as a child and as a teenager. Errol Flynn was the direct descendant of Fletcher Christian, mutiny leader of the HMS Bounty. Errol caught the attention of Warner Bros after a film he made in order to scrape some cash. He quickly rose to fame after Captain Blood and became the undisputed king of swashbuckling films. Every film he appeared in was a classic ranging from romantic comedies, wartime dramas, westerns and adventure films. Flynn's social life gave him a reputation as a womaniser with charismatic charm and his hobbies (which included drinking, fighting, boating and sex, especially sex) were always in the spotlight. Flynn escaped 3 statutory rape charges, though it was mostly proved that it was generally the work of adoring fans and/or publicity stunts to keep up his bad boy image. Flynn's career steadily declined in the mid 1940's, but he made a comeback in 1948 as the ageing Don Juan in `The Adventures of Don Juan' (1948). Flynn's comeback was short-lived and as he aged he got fewer roles and had to get by on the little that he saved from his heyday. Flynn tried to become a serious actor on the stage and in films instead of just a heartthrob who saves the girl, and he did in the 50's in some respectable films. Errol Flynn made many friends including Olivia DeHavilland (who he appeared with in 9 movies) and Fidel Castro. In the late 1950's Flynn's alcoholism got the worst of him and he eventually died of a heart attack aged 50 in 1959.

Olivia DeHavilland as Arabella Bishop: Olivia DeHavilland was born in 1916 and her parents separated when she was 3, so she lived with her aunt in California. Olivia was discovered in her High School production of Shakespeare's `A Midsummer Night's Dream' by director Max Reinhardt. She later played in both his stage version and his film adaption of the play in 1935. After the film she signed a contract with Warner Bros where she played some roles that greatly disappointed her. She landed a role in `Captain Blood' which shot her to fame and later made numerous dramatic films. Olivia was loaned out to MGM for the classic `Gone with the Wind' (1939 with Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Leslie Howard) for which she received a Best Supporting Actress nomination from the Academy Awards. DeHavilland then went back to Warner Bros where she made some good films, but after another loss to the academy awards in 1941 to her sister, Joan Fontaine, she demanded that Warner Bros give her more substantial roles, roles that she would be happy with instead of just the damsel in period dramas and romantic comedies. As a result DeHavilland was put on suspension by Warner Bros for violation of contract and she was out of work. When she returned she was told she had to make up for this six month suspension by working in a few more films that Warner had lined up for her. DeHavilland sued the studio and in a much publicised event, she won. Her movement became known as the DeHavilland decision where no contracted player would have to make up for lost time from the studio. DeHavilland was pleased that studios could no longer treat their stars like cattle, and returned to films in 1946 for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in `To Each His Own'. Olivia began working steadily, making one good film a year, instead of 4 or 5 bad ones. In 1949 she won the Best Actress Academy Award again for her portrayal in William Wyler's `The Heiress' (1949 with Montgomery Clift and Sir Ralph Richardson). She chose to appear in a few films for the rest of her career, and her later films included Robert Aldrich's `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte' (1964 with Bette Davis, Joseph Cotton, Agnes Moorehead, Cecil Kellaway, Victor Buono, Mary Astor, Bruce Dern and George Kennedy), Airport'77 (1977 with Jack Lemmon, Lee Grant, Joseph Cotten, James Stewart, George Kennedy, Christopher lee and Darren McGavin), Irwin Allen's all-star `The Swarm' (1978 with Michael Caine, Richard Widmark, Richard Chamberlain, Henry Fonda and Fred MacMurray) and her last role on the TV film `Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna' (1986 with Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and Christian Bale). Olivia DeHavilland is now retired and lives in quiet retirement in Paris. She is 94 years old and today is the only surviving cast member of `Gone with the Wind'.

Lionel Atwill as Colonel Bishop: Lionel Atwill was born into a wealthy family in 1885. Atwill began acting on the stage in the 1910's and had a successful run on Broadway between 1917 and 1931. Atwill began acting in sound films and was very popular as a villain. Atwill played almost every type of villain from mad scientist to sympathetic father. Atwill appeared in some of the first ever colour features in 1932 and 1933 in `Doctor X' and `Mystery of the wax Museum' (both starring Fay Wray and Arthur Edmund Carewe, both directed by Michael Curtiz). Atwill was just as successful as a police inspector, for which he played in Tod Browning's `Mark of the Vampire' (1935 with Lionel Barrymore, Bela Lugosi and Donald Meek). He was frequently seen in supporting roles in many Warner Bros dramas and period pieces. Atwill made some considerable success as a mad scientist in Universal horror and appeared in `Man Made Monster' (1941 with Lon Chaney Jr), `Night Monster' (1942 with Bela Lugosi, Frank Reicher and Ralph Morgan) and `House of Dracula' (1945 with John Carradine and Lon Chaney Jr). My favourite performance of his was in the comedy `To be or Not to be' (1942 with Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, directed by Ernst Lubitsch). Atwill appeared in many film series and acted in 2 Charlie Chan films, 2 Sherlock Holmes films, 4 Frankenstein films, 1 Dr Kildare film and 1 Abbott and Costello film. In 1943 Atwill's career was crushed after he went to court for holding a supposed ""orgy"" at his house. Atwill continued to act in B-grade films whilst he was on poverty row for the remainder of his life, appearing in a few A-grade pictures in less than memorable roles. Atwill passed away in 1946. He died of lung cancer. Atwill never received a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.

Sir Basil Rathbone as Levasseur: Basil Rathbone was born in 1892 in South Africa. His family was forced to flee South Africa after his father was accused by the Boers of being a British spy. Rathbone grew up in England and loved the theatre, but his father advised against it so he became a clerk. After a year Rathbone fled to a theatre group run by his cousin and was forced to work his way from the bottom. Rathbone fought in WWI and received the Military Cross for his services. He fought in the same battalion as Claude Rains. He made his debut on Broadway in 1921 and was promptly led to films. Rathbone was back and forth between London and New York until 1929 when he gave up the theatre to work on a film career. Rathbone had many roles which usually included romantic leads, sophisticated villains or sophisticated gentlemen. Rathbone's most memorable roles during the 30's and early 40's included his performances in Michael Curtiz's `Captain Blood' (1935 with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland and Lionel Atwill), `David Copperfield' (1935 with Lionel Barrymore and W C Fields), `A Tale of Two Cities' (1935 with Ronald Colman), `Anna Karenina' (1935 with Greta Garbo and Fredric March), the lead in `The last Days of Pompeii' 91935 with Alan Hale), `The Adventures of Robin Hood' (with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland and Claude Rains), the lead in `The Tower of London' (1939 with Boris Karloff and Vincent Price), `The Son of Frankenstein' (1939 with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill), `The Mark of Zorro' (1940 with Tyrone Power, directed by Rouben Mamoulian) and `The Black Cat' (1941 with Alan Ladd, Bela Lugosi, Gladys Cooper and Broderick Crawford). Rathbone had a lengthy career in drama and horror and appeared as Sherlock Holmes in 16 adaptions between 1939 and 1947. Rathbone felt that (although he had fame) the Sherlock Holmes character was killing his career, so he returned to the stage in 1946. Rathbone won a Tony in 1947 and left the stage soon after. Rathbone was knighted in 1949 for his services to the theatre in 1949 and kept busy in films in the 1950's and 1960's. He also appeared on many TV dramas and thrillers. Rathbone appeared spoofing his villainous roles in `The Court Jester' (1955 with Danny Kaye) and his greatest role in later life was in John Ford's all star `The Last Hurrah' (1958 with Spencer Tracy, Pat O'Brien, Donald Crisp, James Gleason, John Carradine, Frank McHugh and Wallace Ford). In Rathbone's later life he did a few films with American International Pictures, appearing in 2 Roger Corman classics `Tales of Terror' (1962 with Vincent Price and Peter Lorre) and `The Comedy of Terrors' with Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff and Joe E Brown). Rathbone was considered Hollywood's greatest sword fighter and even won a fencing championship whilst in the British Army, but on screen he was only ever allowed to win one duel. Rathbone died in 1967 of a heart attack, aged 75.

Henry Stephenson as Lord Willoughby: Henry Stephenson was a character actor born in 1871 and made his Broadway debut in 1901. Stephenson became one of the largest presences in Hollywood during the 30's and 40's and was in almost every costumed drama, historical biopic and period romance. Stephenson was famous as the gentleman, always calm, always kind and always offering words of wisdom to the hero/heroin and in real life his personality wasn't much different. He appeared frequently in Errol Flynn adventure films and his most memorable roles for me would be his portrayals as Mr Laurence in George Cukor's `Little Women' (1932 with Katherine Hepburn), Sir Joseph banks in `Mutiny on the Bounty' (1935 with Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone) which won best picture of 1935, Lord Willoughby in `Captain Blood' (1935 with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland and Lionel Atwill), Sir Charles Macefield in `Charge of the Light Brigade' (1936 with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, Patric Knowles and David Niven), the Duke of Norfolk in `The Prince and the Pauper' (1937 with Errol Flynn and Claude Rains) and Sir Thomas Lancing in `Tarzan Finds a Son!' (1939 with Johnny Weissmuller, Ian Hunter and Maureen O'Sullivan). Stephenson had a long lasting friendship with actors Boris Karloff and C Aubrey Smith. Stephenson died in 1956 aged 85 after a career that lasted 90 memorable roles.

Erich Wolfgang Korngold, the composer: Erich Wolfgang Korngold was born in Vienna in 1897 and was a musician from a very young age. Korngold produced his first orchestral piece at the age of 14 and was a noted composer in Austria for many years. In 1935 Korngold was asked to do the musical score for `A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1935 with James Cagney and Olivia DeHavilland) by adapting a Mendelssohn score. He moved to Hollywood in 1935 upon completion of the score to escape from newly annexed Austria, where he signed a contract with Warner Bros. It took him only 3 weeks to compose the illustrious score for Captain Blood and he was nominated for an Academy Award. During World War II he was Hollywood's greatest composer, creating memorable scores for `Anthony Adverse' (1936 with Fredric March and Olivia DeHavilland), `The Sea Hawk' (1940 with Errol Flynn, Claude Rains and Henry Daniell) for which he received an Academy Award nomination and `Deception' (1946 with Bette Davis, Paul Henreid and Claude Rains) for which he wrote an entire sonata. Korngold won an Academy Award for the score of `The Adventures of Robin Hood' (1938 with Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone). Korngold would improvise scores by getting an orchestra for him to compose and writing the music while watching the scenes on a screen behind the orchestra. He was the first person to use this technique, but today many composers like John Williams and Danny Elfman compose like this. Korngold decided that the world of serious music was gone after the late 1940's and retired from film scoring. Korngold wrote some of his own orchestrations in the 1950's but kept to himself most of the time. He died in 1957 aged 60.

Hobart Cavanaugh as Dr Bronson: Hobart Cavanaugh was a character actor born in Nevada in 1886. Cavanaugh began acting in his youth and appeared on the stage until 1928 when he made his screen debut. Cavanaugh appeared in many films and signed a contract with Warner Bros in 1932. Cavanaugh became typecast as the clerk, the obedient husband or the old man next door and played these parts very well. In 1940 he played the hidden killer in Universal's `Horror Island' (with Dick Foran). Cavanaugh died in 1950 after appearing in almost 190 films.

Donald Meek as Dr Whacker: Donald Meek was born in 1878 and became a stage performer at the age of 8. He appeared in travelling shows and eventually came to the USA in 1912 making his Broadway debut in 1917. As a teenager he fought in the Spanish-American War (1898) and contracted yellow fever, losing most of his hair. He began playing roles older than he was because of this and became a character actor in Hollywood by the 1920's. He was a character actor for Warner Bros for many years, acting in over 100 supporting (ranging from minor to second billing) roles until his death in 1946.
Harry Cording as Kent: Harry Cording was a burly supporting actor who appeared as minor characters in A and B grade films throughout his career. Cording was cast as cockneys, chauffers or henchmen during his 30 year career, appearing in 8 separate Sherlock Holmes features of the 1940's. Cording died in 1954 after a lengthy career in TV and film.
Herbert Holmes as Captain Gardner: Herbert Holmes was a character actor born in 1882 and appeared in many films during the silent era. Though many films he appeared in were very successful, Holmes quickly degraded to a B-grade actor, or a supporting actor for A-grade films, and was often uncredited for many of his later performances in the late 1940's and early 1950's. Holmes appeared in 6 Sherlock Holmes films between 1939 and 1946 (with Basil Rathbone) and in 3 Bulldog Drummond films in the 1930's and 1940's. Holmes appeared in a few major films before his slow demise including Michael Curtiz's colour film `Mystery of the Wax Museum' (1933 with Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Edwin Maxwell and Arthur Edmund Carewe) and Tod Browning's `Mark of the Vampire' (1935 with Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi). Holmes was delegated to lesser roles and was stuck in the horror films of Universal Studios including a very small part in `The Ghost of Frankenstein' (1942 with Lon Chaney Jr, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Lionel Atwill, Ralph Bellamy and Bela Lugosi) where he was simply billed as Magistrate, The Invisible Agent (1942 with Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Peter Lorre) and `The Mummy's Curse' (1944 with Lon Chaney Jr). Holmes appeared uncredited in many films including Alfred Hitchcock's `Foreign Correspondent' (1940 with George Sanders and Edmund Gwenn). Holmes retired from acting in 1952 and died in 1956 in Hollywood.
Halliwell Hobbs as Lord Sunderland (uncredited): Halliwell Hobbs was born in 1877 in London and began a career on the stage in the 1890's and came to Broadway in 1906. Hobbs moved to films in 1929 as an elderly man and played many memorable roles. Hobbs had many appearances in films, including William Keighley's `The Prince and the Pauper' (1937 with Errol Flynn and Claude Rains), Frank Capra's `You Can't Take It With You' (1938 with James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold) which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1938 and Ernst Lubitsch's `To Be or Not to Be' (1942 with Carole Lombard, Jack Benny and Lionel Atwill). He also appeared in many Warner Bros dramas and Universal horrors and suspense films including `The Invisible Man's Revenge' (1944 with John Carradine) and `Sherlock Holmes Faces Death' (1943 with Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce and Dennis Hoey). He turned to television in the 1950's and appeared in many dramatical shows like `Studio One' and `The Alcoa Hour'. Hobbs was a huge presence on Broadway from the 1940's well up into the mid 1950's. Hobbs died in 1962 of a heart attack, aged 84.

The DVD
The DVD for this film is great just like most Warner DVD's. Although Warners weren't really the kings of film in the 1930's and 1940's, they certainly are the kings of restoring classic films on DVD. This film includes `Warner's Night at the Movies' (hosted by Leonard Maltin) which is featured on almost every Warners Classic DVD's. This feature includes a newsreel, a musical short (Johnny Green and His Orchestra), a comedy short (All-American Drawback), a cartoon (billboard Frolics) and a theatrical trailer for another film from that year. The DVD also includes a 20 minute documentary on the film which is very informative entitled `Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born'.

This is the movie role that stole the ""swashbuckler"" mantel from Douglas Fairbanks, making Errol Flynn an instant star.

Errol Flynn carries this movie with boldness, charm and a grand style. This is an exciting movie with all the action, intrigue, and romance you could want in a swashbuckling adventure movie.

This was Errol Flynn's first starring role and it sure got him off to a flying start. Few actors have ever played the ""dashing hero"" as well as Flynn. Despite being almost ""worship idol"" status by women, he is still comes across as a ""man's man,"" and that all started with this film.

What I liked best about this was that the story stood out more than the action or the romance. Many times classic films overdid the latter, producing lulls in what was considered an adventure story. That's not the case here. It also isn't the typical clichd pirate film in which the captain is seen with an eye patch and a parrot on his shoulder.

427282,5,6302120527,"ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! It doesn't get much better than this when it comes to swashbucklers. This film made Errol Flynn & Olivia de Havilland into major movie stars. This is Flynn's second movie in America but his first starring role; for de Havilland it was her third film. Warner Bros. took a big chance when they cast these two in the lead roles; the story behind all of this is some interesting stuff that's told in one of the bonus features.

Dr. Peter Blood (Errol Flynn) is a well respected physician in England. During the rebellion against King James II (Vernon Steele) his friend, Jeremy Pitt (Ross Alexander), arrives at his home asking Dr. Blood to treat a wounded man. The wounded man is a rebel but this doesn't bother Blood, he's a humanitarian & he's bound to do the right thing, politics aside. The Royal forces come in, arrest everyone in the house for aiding & comforting the enemy. In a sham trial a huge group of men are condemned to hang. All the men admit to being guilty except for Blood, he proclaims his innocence saying he was there only to help a wounded man & that his sympathies were not necessarily with the enemy. Shortly before all are to be hung King James II is convinced not to execute the men but to send them to the colonies in the new world & be sold as slaves.

They arrive in Jamaica at Port Royal where they are sold, the vast majority are bought by Col. Bishop (Lionel Atwill). When Bishop wants to inspect Blood's teeth Blood gets obstinate. This leads to an immediate dislike between the two. Bishop's niece, Arabella (Olivia de Havilland), intervenes purchasing Blood because Bishop has decided to pass because Blood appears to be too troublesome. Blood resents what Arabella has done so there is friction between them as well.

The colony's governor is Steed (George Hassell) who suffers from a case of gout. There are only two doctors in the colony & they don't do very well by the governor. Blood is then called in to treat the governor & does a wonderful job. This elevates Blood's status causing him to be on call to the governor. This doesn't set well with Col. Bishop but there's little he can do about it. Blood is now more free to move around & searches for a way to escape the island. He enlists the aid of a local, Honesty Nuttall (Forrester Harvey), to purchase a small ship & supplies. Arabella has observed Blood doing this though she doesn't know exactly what he's up to. She later confronts him but decides not to turn him in. The whole plan is ruined when the Spanish attack Port Royal & capturing it. Blood & his band of men take over the Spanish galleon & save the town. Col. Bishop isn't appreciative enough to grant them their freedom so they toss him overboard & commander the ship & become pirates.

Dr. Blood now becomes Capt. Blood, one of the most feared pirates in the New World. While in Tortuga Blood is convinced by the French pirate, Capt. Levasseur (Basil Rathbone) to become partners. Blood does this against his better judgment but does it nonetheless. Levasseur later captures Arabella & Lord Willoughby (Henry Stephenson) which leads to a duel between Blood & Levasseur in which Levasseur is killed. This is one of the best sword duels you'll ever see on film. Rathbone had the reputation of being the very best in Hollywood with a sword. Blood now owns Arabella still harboring ill feelings toward her but his better self wins out; he grants her her freedom & demands that she do the same for him. He deciders to return her & Lord Willoughby to Port Royal. By this time Col. Bishop has been appointed governor & he wants to recapture Blood at all costs.

Upon arriving at Port Royal the pirates find the town under attack by two ships of the French. Blood decides to drop his two prisoners off at a nearby beach not wanting to aid the British or Bishop. Lord Willoughby, at this time, appeals to Blood's loyalty to England but Blood is too bitter to fight for his country. Willoughby reveals that he's been sent by the King to pardon Blood & his men & assist them in the war against the French. Blood refuses for he has many reasons for not liking King James. Willoughby informs him that the king he is referring to is William of Orange. This changes everythingfor the pirates & they rescue Port Royal once again. The special effects here are noticeably done with miniatures, not being very realistic, but, let's remember, this is 1935.

In the end Blood is made the new governor of Jamaica, he gets Arabella & gets his revenge on Col. Bishop though it's done good-naturedly.

The movie is b&w & is shown in the full screen version. This film was 70 years old when transferred to disc, there are a few spots in the movie where there are ""age spots"" but nothing that will distract from the enjoyment of the movie. There are some bonus features where Warner Bros. enables you to feel like you saw this movie at the theater. Leonard Maltin opens this with ""Warner Night at the Movies 1935"". This includes a newsreel, a musical short ""Johnny Green and His Orchestra"", a comedy short ""All American Drawback"" that features Charlie McCarthy, the cartoon ""Billboard Frolics"", trailers & the new featurette ""Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born"". This last bonus feature is very informative.",1221696000,5,5261,4.5963791267305645
427283,5,6302120527,"""CAPTAIN BLOOD"" is one of the great American classics, and an incredible swashbuckler. It was the movie that made Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland be finally recognized in Hollywood, the first time they paired together in a film, and the first time they acted together under the direction of Michael Curtiz. The story is of Dr. Peter Blood as he treats a man wounded in one of many British civil wars, and is subsequently convicted of treason against the King. Peter is sentenced to working as a slave by the side of many other convicted ""criminals"" in Jamaica, under the cruel authority of Colonel Bishop (Lionel Atwill). Meanwhile, Blood is romancing the beautiful Arabella Bishop (De Havilland), the Colonel's niece. He is eventually able to escape along with his friends. Blood then vows to the sail the Caribbean as a pirate - Captain Blood. His adventures are many - peaking with that great sword fight against the French pirate Levassuer (Basil Rathbone), and ending with an exciting sea battle as he returns to Port Royal to settle some old scores. The romance between De Havilland and Flynn is the first of many romances in their first of eight pictures together. The cast also includes such other excellent acting talents as J. Carrol Naish, Guy Kibbee, Ross Alexander, and Donald Meek, not to mention that the fencing is so good it would be a sin not to consider it a huge part of the movie. A great movie, one of both Flynn and De Havilland's definite best.

427284,5,6302120527,With CAPTAIN BLOOD director Michael Curtiz launches the career of action hero legend Errol Flynn.  Flynn's sword skills would improve in successive films but this is where it all began.  A most for anyone who loves pirates and swashbucklers.,1216166400,,241,5.153846153846154
427285,4,6302120527,"If you have ever seen The Goonies, you know that Sloth has a penchant for pirates and watches Captain Blood when he's chained up at home. Well, if it is good enough for Sloth, it is good enough for me.

Blood (Errol Flynn) is a doctor, but when he is caught treating a rebel soldier, he is rounded up with the rest of the rebels to be sold into slavery. He is bought by Col. Bishop's niece (Olivia de Havilland) who takes a liking to him despite his rudeness and arrogance. It is all he can do to tolerate his chains, especially when his friends are mistreated. One night, they all make a break for it, and declare a life of piracy, especially against England.

A rousing adventure that speeds by despite its length, Captain Blood is entertaining all the way through. It is no wonder Flynn became such a sensation after making this film; Blood is an admirable character. Two of Warner Brothers' stock actors make memorable appearances as well, Ross Alexander as Jeremy Pitt and Guy Kibbee as Hagthorpe.",1213142400,,1002,4.530386740331492
427286,5,6302120527,"Errol Flynn was at his BEST!

Move over Captain Jack Sparrow! I absolutely love this picture. It's one of my favorite classics, even though Flynn died many years before I was even born.  I fell in love with him!  Captain Peter Blood is the original Pirate of the Carribean indeed. This is where it all started.  Everything about this picture is grand. The story, the romance between Captain Blood and Arabella Bishop, the pirate ships, the swordfighting, and the MUSIC.  The musical score is magnificent!

My heart skips a beat everytime I think of this movie!  That is how precious this movie is to me. I'm glad to finally own this movie on DVD.",1212278400,3,646,4.614035087719298
427287,5,6302120527,This is the first Errol Flynn movie I watched; my father introduced me to it.  It is still my favorite of all of his.  I just fell in love with the style and Errol's panache captured me.  It is a little dated but still the story is so fun and the characters and actors are just wonderful.  The chemistry between Olivia and Errol started here and continued for years.  I love this film.,1210204800,,385,4.219178082191781
427288,5,6302120527,"To begin with, I don't understand why Captain Blood is frequently dismissed, only considered worth mentioning because it was the film that made Errol Flynn a star.  I'll admit that I'm a relative novice when it comes to classic pirate films as well as classic Flynn films (I haven't even seen Robin Hood yet!), but this film was so rich that I can't imagine a wider knowledge of the genre diminishing its grandeur.

I approached this film looking for a good sword-fight.  I'd never seen a swash-buckler film and felt I was missing out.  In that respect, Captain Blood might almost seem like a disappointment.  It takes a very long time to get to any real action, and there's only one memorable duel in the film.  However, what I found instead was an instantly likable, earthy protagonist, at war with himself as well as his nation, all while cracking witty one-liners and endearing the audience with his vibrant sincerity.  Add to this a highly compelling plot about revenge and self-realization, a masterful ensemble cast, countless laugh-out-loud moments that truly feel earned as opposed to obligatory, excellent pacing that manages to prevent a two hour film from ever feeling dull, a very convincing and endearing romantic sub-plot, and exceptional special effects for the time period (delivered in excess at the film's climax).  No, the action doesn't come quickly or frequently in this film, but what you get in its place makes the wait more than worthwhile.  My wife and I will be watching this film again and again.

I think it's also worthwhile to mention Leonard Maltin's ""Warner Night at the Movies,"" included on this disk.  It features a hand-picked selection of short reels that would have been shown at the movies along with Captain Blood in 1935.  I've always wanted to see something like this on a DVD extra features menu.  Finally, I can see a classic film in something close to its original context, amidst a myriad of reels from varied genres -- a true Depression Era variety show.  Each of the reels has a charm of its own, from the explicitly budget-conscious trailer for A Midsummer Night's Dream (""At Popular Prices"") to a news reel in which Bruno Hauptmann is sentenced to death for kidnapping the Lindburgh baby and FDR pledges to keep the United States out of the emerging conflict in Europe.  Add Charlie McCarthy, an early Warner Brothers cartoon, and a big band performance to the equation, and you're set for one fine evening at the 1930s movies.  My only regret with this feature is that you can't watch all the reels together.  Each must be accessed individually on the special features menu.

Regarding the particulars of this transfer of the film, the picture is quite clear, and, though a few lines of dialogue get lost here and there, the sound is relatively good for a film from the mid-1930s.

All in all, this is a treasure of a DVD.  Any fan of classic films, pirate or otherwise, would be amiss to pass this one up.",1198886400,5,2957,4.76078431372549
427289,5,6302120527,"Like all of his films, Errol Flynn cuts the dashing figure.  Called from his bed to aid a wounded Nobleman (Irish fighting the English), DR. Blood is arrested for treason.  Guilty for saving a wounded man (who fought against King James, He and the Irish are sent to Port Royal to be sold as slaves/indentured servants (if they live that long).  He is purchased by Olivia de Haviland (she wants to save him from a terrible fate) even so he doesn't appreciate her help.  Later he succeeds by various means to save himself and his fellows whereupon they become pirates.  Eventually, he returns Olivia's favor.  After some fine sword play he rescues the girl, but he is not out of the woods yet.... (I'm not telling the end...).  It is great fun in the spirit of these old films and for those that love them it is time well spent.",1198368000,,826,4.466666666666667
427290,3,6302120527,it is a very exciting film with a good story and a good cast although its b&w it dosn't dilute from the story,1195603200,,109,3.782608695652174
427291,2,6302120527,"There were too many grotesque elements for me to enjoy this film.

1) Errol Flynn's mechanical performance
2) Korngold's not-so-background music
3) The moments of burlesque humor
4) Ze Franch aksaunts (especially, Basil Rathbone's)
5) The variable performances
6) The tepid story
7) And -- most grotesque of all -- in the ""making of"" featurette, the men going ga-ga over Errol Flynn while treating the sweet and lovely Olivia de Havilland as ""also in the film""

This movie made Olivia a star too -- but movie history didn't regret that. Her acting skills (already much better than Flynn's) would get even better, whereas, Flynn never really rose above this level -- where he had to be posed and coached to give a decent performance.

That the story doesn't click can be demonstrated by comparing it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BLACK-SWAN/dp/B000FFJ83A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BLACK SWAN</a>&nbsp;which has practically the same story -- even tho that's hardly a great film either.

That's so much better. And it's in color, too.",1194825600,4,1337,6.335164835164835
427332,4,6302120527,"CAPTAIN BLOOD, based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini, was the first movie to feature the successful star combination of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.  The mix of swashbuckling thrills and breathless romance is irresistible.

In 17th century London, respected physician Peter Blood (Errol Flynn) is sold into a slave trade and subsequently escapes to become a notorious pirate king.  Olivia de Havilland plays Arabella Bishop, the headstrong niece of Blood's former master (Lionel Atwill).

This was Errol Flynn's debut as a leading man at Warner Brothers.  The role of Blood was originally intended for Robert Donat (star of the popular ""Count of Monte Cristo"") before being offered to Brian Aherne, who also passed on the project.  Errol Flynn, a relatively minor contract player, was recommended for the role; CAPTAIN BLOOD launched his career and he spent the next several years as the reigning king of the swashbuckler genre.

Much of CAPTAIN BLOOD's success was due to the strong chemistry between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.  Similarly, this film helped establish de Havilland as an important new star; she had made her film debut playing Hermia in Warners' star-studded 1935 version of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" before idling in B-comedies; CAPTAIN BLOOD and the role of feisty Arabella helped endear her to the public.  Errol and Olivia went on to be paired in many more wonderful movies (including ""Dodge City"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Santa Fe Trail"").  The cast also features Basil Rathbone and Guy Kibbee.

The DVD version of CAPTAIN BLOOD also includes the trailer, Making-Of featurette ""Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler is Born"", Merrie Melodies cartoon ""Billboard Frolics"",  VitaPhone short ""All-American Drawback"" with Charlie McCarthy, and newsreel.",1189900800,,1787,5.320284697508897
427333,5,6302120527,"Rafael Sabatini wrote a range of heroic characters in high adventure stories from Scaramouche to the Sea Hawk and Captain Blood.  Any one of those stories are superior to the Pirates of the Carribean.  The problem with remaking them is we don't have any living actor who comes close to Errol Flynn or even Stewart Granger.  So, I highly recommend going retro and watching anyone of the three.  I'd start with Blood first.",1186531200,3,421,4.726027397260274
427334,5,6302120527,"The first great feature of Errol Flynn  and (at least to my mind) the role of his lifetime as well as the supreme beauty of Olivia de Havilland make of this movie a singular and reference movie in this decade.

Captain blood is one these unforgettable epic tales based on Sabatini's novel about a doctor who is forced to become a pirate. But along the story is showed, there will be many chances to know him, his real nature as human being who seriously wishes by all his means, to avoid to be considered a slave, he will the intellectual leader for the escape and will assume the authority delineated by a sort of statement of Principles  among the members under his command, in order to avoid a supposed mutiny inspired by the greed or any other motive.

The admirable duel with Levesseur and his formidable audacious to undertake and even save the honor of the English Army when they are besieged in Port Royal will deserve not only a sudden achievement in his life, but besides he will find the love of his life as you and me are aware from the firsts shots.

Michael Curtiz was the same director of the charge of the light brigade so it's not unusual to think he his preferences for the epic genre.",1185321600,4,1203,4.425339366515837
427335,2,6302120527,"This film, being the better part of a century old and still watched today, might technically qualify as a 'classic,' but I personally disliked it strongly. This is likely because I first read the Rafael Sabatini novel of the same title, on which the film is based, and utterly loved it. In fact, it is one of my absolute favourite books.

The novel is an emotionally gripping, powerful story populated by realistic characters, people with real feelings and personalities. This film, however, is just a quick, cheap Hollywood action flick, the 1930s version of today's flashy and mindless shoot-them-up movies. The plot of Sabatini's book has been changed and, in some scenes, totally reversed to turn Captain Blood from a realistic, passionate, deep character into a two-dimensional macho action hero. Obviously any book must be cut to be changed into a film; but Captain Blood was not merely simplified but simplified -in spirit- for this production.

The most enjoyable part of this movie, for me, was watching the old-fashioned special effects, with all the pretty model ships.

Go read the book instead -- odds are, you'll love it regardless of whether you liked or hated this movie.",1184889600,7,1187,5.0152284263959395
427336,5,6302120527,"This is a marvelous DVD, a beautiful reproduction of a classic film with many great extra features. The documentary on the making of the film is wonderfully done, and makes the movie more memorable viewing.",1184198400,,206,4.914285714285715
427337,4,6302120527,"As a fan of swashbuckling and pirate films since childhood, I highly recommend Captain Blood with that charming rogue, Errol Flynn.  I'll watch anything with Errol, especially the movies he made with Olivia DeHavilland.  Great chemistry there.  Pirates, pretty ladies, sword fights and beautiful Caribbean scenery - what else could I ask for . . . except maybe some rum.",1184025600,,370,5.133333333333334
427338,5,6302120527,"Charming, fun, romantic, perfectly-paced, thoughtful, well-written, beautifully shot, smart...I could go on forever. This movie is a masterpiece. To know that Michael Curtiz went from this to The Adventures of Robin Hood, and from that to Casablanca is no surprise. If you have even a fleeting interest in high adventure along the lines of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl', then buy this classic immediately.",1182297600,2,457,5.1891891891891895
427339,5,6302120527,"With pirates all the rage once more, what better time to return to one of the classic films of the genre -- and what a delight! Errol Flynn & Olivia de Havilland are a physically stunning couple, true stars in the making, and their genuine affection for one another shows in their scenes together. Basil Rathbone turns in a wonderfully over-the-top performance of leering, moustache-twirling villainy, while Lionel Atwill is smoothly & appropriately hateful as de Havilland's poisonous uncle.

There's a surprisingly small amount of full-scale action, as the film's true strength is in its depiction of the characters' emotions -- not that it drags by any means! But we get to see what drives Peter Blood & what sort of man he is. Just look at his reaction to Jeremy Pitt's flogging -- outrage, anger, a burning hunger for justice. That's what so many of Flynn's best films were about, and it's shown quite effectively here. If some of the dialogue & acting creaks just a bit, then that simply adds to the charm of the film. This is how they used to be made, and we wouldn't have it any other way!

Thoroughly rewatchable entertainment, most highly recommended!",1180483200,4,1161,4.8
427340,5,6302120527,"Captain Blood is one of those films I always undervalue, which at least means that each time I see it I'm pleasantly surprised by how much better it is than I remembered. Despite the lack of action until the spectacular finale, it has a good plot and some great visuals, as you'd expect from Michael Curtiz, but a big part of the fun is watching Errol Flynn become a star before your eyes: it's easy to guess which scenes were shot during the first couple of weeks when he was still a little awkward, but the confidence, charm and vigour he brings to the part easily overshadows his few missteps, and he and Olivia De Havilland are one of those rare perfect onscreen couples. Basil Rathbone's Fronch axe-scent is so out-ray-juss that even he can't keep a straight face (he literally has to turn away from the camera at one point as he gets a fit of giggles). His swordfight with Flynn is the only real disappointment, a surprisingly flat number even if we didn't have Robin Hood to compare it with. Wonderfully entertaining on every level.

As well as being the uncut version of the film, Warners' DVD comes with an excellent array of extras too - a documentary on the making of the film, a 1937 radio adaptation, trailer and selected short subjects recreating the whole 1935 moviegoing experience.",1180310400,2,1298,4.619047619047619
427341,5,6302120527,"A marvelous swash-buckler of a movie, the DVD is set up to simulate a typical afternoon at the movies, with all the proper assortment of short subjects including Coming Attractions, Newsreel, Musical interlude and Cartoon.  Just like it used to be.  I was too young to have seen the original on first release, but probably did see it later on.  All the talk about ship models and tight budgets you can forget.  The test is on the screen and it triumphantly succeeds.",1177113600,2,466,4.646341463414634
427389,4,6302120527,"This was the film which launched Errol Flynn's stardom.  There are many comprehensive reviews but here are a few general comments:

- Flynn was not the first choice for the role of Peter Blood and Jack Warner, head of the studio, took a major risk in handing him the role.  Some of the early footage was scrapped and reshot as Flynn's confidence grew.
 - The swashbuckler film had been out of favour since the silent era of Douglas Fairbanks, but the success of ""Treasure Island"" and ""The Count of Monte Christo"" in 1934 urged Warner Brothers to offer their entry into the genre.
- The DVD quality is good but not perfect.  The film is grainy in spots and sometimes there is a noticeable mark on the print.
- Olivia de Havilland was only 19 at the time and she is very talented as well as exquisite looking.
- Basil Rathbone's part is very small and he must have the worst French accent on film.  This was not his finest hour, in spite of the climactic sword fight. The image of him lying on the rocks as the water runs over him when he is stabbed is gruesome.
- Lionel Atwell is a superb villian.  You really hiss when he is on screen. The ending of the film with his fate unknown is clever.
- The film's restricted budget is sometimes evident with obvious studio backdrops and spartan sets but the fight scenes are very well done with interpolated footage from other films.  The ship models are clever and the climactic collision is riveting.

The DVD contains a good documentary about the film and the original trailer.  As part of the Errol Flynn Signature Collection, the DVD is good value.",1172361600,,1595,4.468965517241379
427390,5,6302120527,"Errol Flynn, Tasmanian born actor, is not only the quintessential swashbuckling hero of days of yore, he is a most accomplished actor who enunciates his lines in perfect upper-class English.

427393,5,6302120527,"Errol Flynn to me is the definitive pirate. Handsome, dashing, and full of spirit. It was never planned for him to be teh star in Captain Blood. Rather, the man who was supposed to star in it wasn't able to so they stuck an almost unknown actor in the starring role. A good thing they did, for not only did they get a stellar performance, it also launced his carrer which allowed him to ultimately star in 'The Adventures of Robin Hood.'

Errol Flynn movies always deliver the action. Another you might like is 'They Died with their Boots On'. A rather fun movie of the life of Gerorge Armstrong Custer. Not very historically accurate but that aside, is a great movie.",1162166400,,668,4.475409836065574
427394,5,6302120527,"The other reviews focus more on the plot surrounding the B&W film ""Captain Blood"" than on some isolated scenes of pure cinematic brilliance. I've seen this movie many times and have enjoyed the chemistry between dashingly handsome Errol Flynn and  stunningly lovely Olivia de Havilland more and more with each viewing. Those scenes in particular in which Miss Bishop (de Havilland) is Mistress to Dr. Blood's (Flynn) Slave and then Peter Blood's Master to Arabella Bishop's Slave are full of romantic tension laced with subtle humor, as though both were having fun verbally besting each other. Another great moment was the sword fight on the beach between smiling adversaries Flynn and Basil Rathbone, with Rathbone doing an incredible impersonation of a Dastardly French Pirate. The only other sword fight I can think of that comes close to this one being a classic is in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" between Ronald Coleman  and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. If you haven't had the opportunity to see this swashbuckling film, rent it and treat yourself to a big bowl of popcorn and be prepared for a rousing adventure.

427397,5,6302120527,"Captain Blood, based fairly accurately on Rafael Sabatini's classic novel, presents us with the forerunner of today's romantic pirate.  Played beautifully by Erroll Flynn, Captain Blood is a brilliant, impetuous doctor cast by fortune into slavery, and from slavery into piracy by fickle fate.  Wonderfully dramatic, it is a picture which helped launch Errol Flynn to stardom, and made swashbuckling a hollywood tradition.",1155513600,,422,5.682539682539683
427398,5,6302120527,"""You speak treason!""

""Fluently.""

Errol Flynn's witty reply comes from ""Robin Hood,"" another of his hugely entertaining swashbucklers, but it also captures the soul of his pirate classic, Captain Blood. A justly enduring adventure, Captain Blood showcases Flynn at his youthful fiery best, as well as superb casting, terrific action sequences (one of film's most compelling sword duels, set on a pirate beach)and Olivia De Havilland--sparks fly, to be sure! But its greatness lies not just in its swordfights and battles, but in its rousing story of injustice overcome against great odds.

The charge of treason against Blood was unreasoning and injust in the extreme; he was merely a doctor treating the wounded of the English civil war. Sentenced without regard to his innocence, he is sent to a hellhole prison island in the Caribbean and must join a daring escape with other nothing-to-lose prisoners.

After the escape, he turns to piracy--ironically, a ""brotherhood"" of rough-hewn democracy and loyalty at the very opposite end of the spectrum from the society which cruelly imprisoned him over an imagined political crime. As a pirate Captain, Blood is fair and just--again, in stark contrast with the government which so wrongly convicted and enslaved him.

The female interest, Olivia de Havilland, at first heaps scorn on him as a low-life traitor who obviously deserved his fate; this being Hollywood, she eventually sees the error of her assumptions and falls for the dashing pirate.

While all of this sounds like typical adventure, its timelessness rests partly on its subtext of injustice and suffering being defeated not by working through an oppressive, corrupt ""system"" but through comradeship and an anti-hero idealism: though we be pirates, we hold to a code of honor, and plunder only the wealthy.

There is a mythic quality to this storyline, of course, but there is also a very clear ""anti-hero"" thread to Blood's rejection of ""official"" justice and his embrace of a rough-and-ready justice dealt out with the blade of a sword and a broadside of cannons.

This must have resonated especially powerfully with Depression-era audiences.

What was the Depression if not a heaping of undeserved poverty on innocents? The ""system,"" controlled by a self-serving financial and political elite, had failed spectacularly; this film depicts a scenario in which the struggles to escape the imprisonment of poverty and passivity are eventually rewarded--but only after the ""crew"" adheres to a shared set of just rules: the pirates' code of honor and the election of a strong, idealistic, fair-minded captain.

The great irony at the heart of this film is that true justice lies not with the system but with the pirates, the supposed renegades. Captain Blood achieves his redemption not by docilely awaiting ""justice"" from his overlords (their verdict was basically an appeals-free death sentence), but by escaping prison and fighting the system of wealth and privilege on the high seas.

It is interesting to speculate what might have become of Captain Blood in the film world of the 1970s, the heyday of anti-heroes. Perhaps Blood would have rejected clemency and remained a pirate. But in the 1930s, the ""system"" was viewed as capable of recognizing injustice and correcting it. Was this a political subtext or simply story-telling? If you consider the widespread suffering of people during this time, you might find a message not for 1685 but for the era in which the film was made (1935, at the height of the Great Depression). The movie was based on a book, of course, but Hollywood changed book-based stories at will when the ending didn't suit the message they wanted to send (""The Good Earth,"" by Pearl S. Buck, for example, had a much different ending than the movie of the same name.)

Regardless of any subtexts, we root for Captain Blood precisely because he was wronged, and we find great satisfaction in his contempt for the harsh and faulty judgment of his corrupt government. We cheer when he looses a broadside into his ""betters"" who so breezily sent him to a death-camp. Great adventure, great story, great message: Blood was forced to overcome injustice by breaking out of the system rather than passively awaiting a justice which would never have come.",1153526400,3,4283,5.102857142857143

427453,5,6302120527,"This was Errol Flynn's first big film, and he is dazzling in it. Michael Curtiz and MGM were not able to get the actors they wanted for the part of Captain Blood (at the top of the list was Robert Donat), and took an enormous risk in hiring this unknown, inexperienced young man, as the star of the film. The results are fantastic, and ""Captain Blood"" was a huge success, and is perhaps the best swashbuckler ever made. Olivia de Havilland had only played minor roles before her part as Arabella, the niece of the evil Col. Bishop (Lionel Atwill), and this film also established her career. She is sweet and lovely, and the scene where Blood and Arabella finally confess their love for one another is unforgettable. They make a gorgeous pair, and were to make 7 more films together.

The plot centers around a doctor (Blood), who is unfairly sentenced by a corrupt judge for being ""a rebel against the king"". His life is spared, and he is sent to Port Royal, Jamaica, to be sold as a slave, and after escaping, piracy becomes his only means of existence. ""And thus Captain Blood began his piracy...with a ship, a handful of men, and a brain.""  Basil Rathbone is marvelous as the bad guy Captain Levasseur, and the swordplay on a rocky shore between Blood and Levasseur (Laguna Beach substituting for Jamaica) is superb. Others in the supporting cast include J. Carrol Naish and Guy Kibbee.

With fast paced direction by Curtiz, a stupendous debut film score by classical composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and cinematography by Hal Mohr, with clever use of miniatures in the seafaring scenes, this film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Nominated by the Academy for Best Picture and Sound, total running time is 120 minutes.

427458,4,6302120527,"1935 black & white movie (though I'm sure there's a colorized TNT version out there somewhere).  Action/Adventure/Swashbuckling

DVD features: Besides the movie (which can be heard in English or French and can be read in English, Spanish, or French), the DVD contains many Special Features.  The Special Features include: Leonard Maltin hosted ""Warner Night at the Movies 1935,"" which contains many things of the period that would have been shown on screen before the main feature like a newsreel, musical short, etc.; ""Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler is Born"" featurette (about the film: including Rudy Behlmer, Author/Film Historian,  Lincoln D. Hurst and others; - the time period the film was created, and some of 1920s history; Robert Donat was originally offered the role of Captain Blood, he passed, and Warner Brothers didn't think anyone else under contract could play the role or not available; Flynn worked for WB England and did films in England and came over to the US to work under contract for WB US, and eventually was offered several chances to play the role (he previously had bit parts for WB US films);  February 22, 1937 (a Monday) radio production of the film (audio); and a movie trailer of the film.

Credits: Starring Errol Flynn (Captain Peter Blood; ""The Sea Hawk""), Olivia de Havilland (Arabella Bishop; ""The Fifth Musketeer""), Lionel Atwill (Colonel Bishop; ""Pardon My Sarong""), Basil Rathbone (Levasseur; ""Queen of Blood""), Ross Alexander (Jeremy Pitt; ""China Clipper""), Guy Kibbee (Hagthorpe; ""Fort Apache""), Henry Stephenson (Lord Willoughby; ""Mr. Lucky""), Robert Barrat (Wolverstone; ""They Were Expendable""), Hobart Cavanaugh (Dr. Bronson; ""Kismet"").  Directed by Michael Curtiz (""Casablanca"").  Music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold (""The Sea Hawk"").  Based on the book by Rafael Sabatini (""Captain Without a Country"").  Screenplay by Casey Robinson (""The Earth is Mine"").

Plot: Errol Flynn plays Peter Blood, a physician that escapes imprisonment and becomes a pirate (Captain Blood) in the 1600s (specifically, the movie starts in 1685).  A rebellion breaks out in England and Blood, sitting out of the fighting (he has had enough of fighting), ends up on trial for treason.  Why? He attempted to aid a traitor by attempting to treat his wounds (and his own temper and words to the soldiers inspecting the issue certainly didn't help).  For this act, and by his own words at trial, Blood was convicted for treason and sentenced to hang until dead.  Before that occurred (and the movie ended before it began), the ""King's Whim"" sends off Peter Blood, and some others, to Port Royal to be sold as slaves (for ten years), forever after barred from returning to England. Once in Port Royal, Arabelle Bishop buys Blood to keep him from the mines.  And eventually, Blood escapes and becomes a pirate (don't want to give too much away here).

Review: First noticeable difference between this movie and most modern movies (beyond the black & white nature) is the obvious filming on stage look (there are some ""real,"" non-staged scenes).  Despite this comment, the ""period"" setting and costumes are impressive (and what you would expect from this type of film).  The music is quite impressive and good (and quite properly sets the mood and creates atmosphere).  The acting is quite good, and while the villains are obvious, they aren't clichs (as in they don't wear ""black hats"" as in a Western).

The movie is intriguing, the plot is good, and there is a certain amount of tension as the plot unfolds.  Overall, I would rate the movie 4.34 stars.",1118102400,4,3568,5.104991394148021
427539,5,6302120527,"Just to add in my own two cents:

I must be honest and own that I love this movie!  I am sad when I remember watching it as a child, not appreciating its worth. I think this is actually my favorite movie of all time.

For the time that it was made in, Captain Blood was made incredibly well, and the actors played their parts superbly.  I don't know of any way that this movie could have been better!

I believe that it is through Captain Blood that we really get our idea of ""good"" pirates.  He is a hero through and through!  This movie is just awesome all around, and embodies the true nature of a classic!

(And I think that if my last name was ""Blood"", then I would have become a pirate too!)",1116633600,4,697,4.073529411764706
427540,5,6302120527,"I have been steaming for some time now about the dearth of Errol Flynn offerings in DVD format. The excellent ""Objective Burma"" has been out for a while (a first rate war movie with a first-rate performance by Flynn as its centerpiece), as has ""Santa Fe Trail"" (with Flynn pal Ronald Reagan as ""sidekick""), and ""Kim"", and ""The Master of Ballantrae"" and ""The Prince And the Pauper"", but...except for the brilliantly awesome ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" (which gives Kevin Costner a swift kick in the rear)... the truly classic Flynn starrers have remained on VHS for way too long.

  That deficiency has now been remedied with a veritable FLOOD of Flynn DVD releases, with...hopefully....several more to come, including ""Gentleman Jim"", ""The Dawn Patrol"", ""Adventures of Don Juan"", and, certainly the FABULOUS ""Charge of the Light Brigade"".

The cavalry charge in this last is unforgettable and is still considered the greatest horse-action sequence ever put to film, even up to the present CGI era. When Flynn leaps his mount over the last barricade into the Russian gun emplacement on the Balaklava Heights, and comes face to face with Henry Brandon's mass-murdering ""Surat Khan"", there's no viewer alive who doesn't feel his/her blood pressure kick into overdrive. The heart and mind together yell ""GET him""!

  But all these glorious thrills notwithstanding, the 1935  ""Captain Blood"" started it all and remains, to this day, the single greatest pirate movie ever filmed. Designed as a vehicle for a popular actor of the time Robert Donat (""Mr. Chips""), Donat bowed out to other committments and Warners went to re-casting. Among those screen-tested was Flynn, and he made a solid impression with the producers. A few more testings and Flynn STILL turned in the best ""showing' and the studio decided to take a HUGE gamble and go with this unknown. Flynn . paired with the 18-year-old Olivia DeHavilland...his beloved ""Livvie""...begame the biggest ""overnight star sensation"" in Hollywood history"" (his closest competition being the late James Dean), and ""Blood""...Jack Warner's biggest risk...one of his greatest studio triumphs.

  Physician Peter Blood, caught up as an innocent on Monmouth's Rebellion in the 1680s, is condemned as a traitor and sent to Jamaica as a slave. Bought by Arabella Bishop (""Livvie""), he earns the enmity of her father , Lionel Atwill (Col. Bishop) . Blood chafes at slavery and leads a mass escape from the Bishop plantation. He and his fellows turn pirate and are very successful at it.

  A series of buccanner adventures follow..including a superb tideline duel with Basil Rathbone that pre-sages their classic Robin Hood duel three years later. Flynn killes Rathbone's character and saves a captive Arabella Bishop from ""Levasseur's""

lecherous designs.

  Later, pardoned by the new British King, William of Orange, Blood and crew take commissions in William's navy and sail against the French ""fleet"" (not even a squadron, actually...only two vessels) beseiging Port Royal. After a thrilling sea battle and hot-lead-&-cold-steel boarding of the enemy's last vessel, the day is won.

  Flynn gets the governorship and the girl...and almost unparalled stardom across America and, shortly, the world.

  As much as the impression has persisted over time that actors like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and even John Wayne ""carried"" Warner Brothers through the late 1930s and 40s, that impression is erroneous. Errol Flynn ""carried"" WB in those days. HE was the ""box office money machine""...the ""Franchise"". And all of that began with ""Captain Blood"". It is rousing to this day. And, as the Barnes & Noble clerk...mid-20s, spiked hair, earring...who sold me this DVD said, ""This guy is BOSS! He blows Depp right off the dock and into the water!!!!"".  Hear! Hear!

427543,5,6302120527,"When they talk about the golden age of Hollywood pirate movies, this is the movie they're talking about. 26-year-old Errol Flynn stars as a compassionate surgeon wrongly accused of treason and condemned to indentured slavery in the West Indies, where he leads the other brutalized slaves to steal a ship and take to piracy to survive, the only means of livelihood and liberty open to them. This idea of oppressed men choosing the sea over a life of servitude is historically realistic and emotionally stirring.

The youthful Flynn (so early in his career he has not yet grown his trademark pencil-thin moustache) commands the screen in the role that made his name synonymous with romantic swashbuckling. He's as stirring in the shipboard action (and there's plenty of it) as he is soulful in the dramatic scenes.

Unfortunately, the lovely Olivia De Havilland is stuck playing the standard pirate movie heroine: the disapproving noble lady flouncing around in her petticoats while the men go off and have all the fun. She's spirited enough in her compassion for Blood, the slave, and her rebuke of Blood, the pirate. But women with red blood in their veins will long to see a gutsier, less conventional heroine winning the outlaw captain's heart.

An added dimension of hilarity for me, a former USCG officer and square rigger sailor, are Hollywood's depictions of life at sea.  What a hoot!  Below deck areas, even for slaves, are enormous. Olivia de Havilland's cabin has a huge four poster bed!  Flynn's captain's cabin has these huge bay windows that open out to the sea.  Lots of details are just funny, like the little biddy cannons they use--we're a long way from Master and Commander.  In the climactic battle scene, Flynn's ship pretends to be French and attacks one of two real French ships that are bombarding Fort Royal.  He creams one ship, then turns the wheel to cause his ship to maneuver sideways over to the other French ship, which never noticed its comrade being attacked!

427546,5,6302120527,"Captain Blood is a great film, let alone a tremendous pirate film.  There's something about the plot that has a certain resonance today as much as that of Robin Hood, namely that age-old sense of justice triumphing over rigid law and order, of robbing the rich to feed the poor.  Yet Captain Blood is a little rougher edged, a little crueler in its machinations.  Peter Blood (Flynn) is a well-meaning doctor who happens to aid the wrong side in one of Britain's innumerable civil wars, and is sentenced into slavery in the outer colonies along with a pack of other unfortunates.  Right from the moment you see him level his icy gaze at the consumptive, soon-to-be dead Royal judge who passed the sentence, you know this party is just getting started.
Hollywood has used the 'good-man-wronged' scenario countless times since this movie, but rarely to such effect.  Battered, beaten, but never broken, Dr. Peter Blood transforms into Captain Blood, the terror of the high seas that crushes his enemies without ever letting anyone affect his high-minded moral core.  It was not his choice to become an outlaw, but if he has to become one, he will be the best one there ever was.  Redemption, honor, and love all make their appearances in the fine script enacted by a worthy cast, but at every point Blood is a man in control of, and therefore responsible for, his own destiny.  It's a great film and one you definitely should check out.",1060300800,91,1434,4.730923694779117
427547,5,6302120527,"I think that this is one of the greatest action - adventure films and perhaps the greatest adventure-epic film about pirates ,ever made in cinema's history. Adapted from Raffael Sabbatini's homonymous novel, ""Captain Blood"" introduced 26 years old Australian-born actor Errol Flynn, in Hollywood as a great star and it was the first of a movie-series that granted him the title of ""swashbucklers's king"".The film also created Flynn's image (solidified in the next years) as the dashing young romantic adventurer hero who always saves the day. Flynn plays the Irish doctor Peter Blood who becomes the handsome gentleman rogue pirate of the Caribbean with bravado and charisma ,appearing his great talent that made him a legend. But here we can locate some historical inaccuracy , (an inheritance of 19th century's romantic literature ) because the real pirates were quite repulsive, poor , illiterate  and not fascinating and educated sea knights. The historical background on the contrary is quite accurate and very interesting. The film beggins in 1685 when Duke of Monmouth organised an unsuccessfull rebellion and portrays England during the 1680s, the reign of James II before the advent of the Glorious Revolution which sees him removed in favor of William III of Orange and Queen Mary. An other notable point is that the film portrays pro-catholic King James II as an evil and cruel tyrannical persona ,a fact that might be seen  as a film's pro-protestant position on history, yet don't forget that this story is adapted from a novel and this was Sabbatini's view on historical facts.
  Curtiz's direction is excellent and impressive,especially at the great terrific sea battle  which is amazing. Olivia de Havilland is brilland and adorable as Flynn's sweet love interest ,with astonishing beauty. Even she is only 19 years old ,she plays her role with maturity and high professional capability. Basil Rathbone is perfect as the villain-fond of women French pirate Levasseur (and as swordfighter) using a peculiar french accent . Lionel Atwill as de Havilland's uncle is very convincing as a brutal plantation owner who finally reconciles with Captain Blood (Errol Flynn).You have also to notice the great performances by the actors who compose Captain Blood's crew. They're really charming.

427548,5,6302120527,"This film starts with the 1685  Duke of Monmouth rebellion.  The battle of Sedgemoor rages in the background as Errol Flynn's character is wrongly accused of supporting the rebels.  King James II is portrayed as an arrogant prince, something which most Protestants of the day would have agreed with, and which Hollywood does not seem to deny.  James, while detached, was not the cold hearted fool we see here.  But this is only a minor point.  The film has historic interest, portraying England as it does during the 1680s, the reign of James II before the advent of the Glorious Revolution which sees him removed in favor of William III of Orange and Queen Mary.  The movie only touches on these political developments, but its interesting to see them as factors in the background.
The rest is pure Hollywood adventure with fiction playing havoc with fact!  Still, the movie is so entertaining and classy that we don't mind a few historical gaffes.  Flynn is elegant in his first major role, and Olivia Dehavland is strikingly beautiful.  Hard to beleive she was only 18 when this film was made.  The rest of the supporting cast may be a bit standard for a 1930s production, but they pull their weight well with all the cute touches of the day.

427602,5,6302120527,"Michael Curtiz knew what he was doing when he brought the swashbuckling genre into the nation's theaters in 1935.  Rafael Sabatini had written the novel CAPTAIN BLOOD and Curtiz knew that the battle scenes would transfer supremely well to the large screen.  Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland were not the first choices for the leads, but a series of timely illnesses and misfortunes to the other candidates landed them the roles that showed such electric chemistry that Flynn and De Havilland were to be continually paired for the next decade.  CAPTAIN BLOOD was such a huge hit that it was nominated for Best Picture (MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY won) and its success left Flynn in the enviable position as the only swashbuckler the paying audience wanted.
  Flynn is Doctor Peter Blood, a 17th century Englishman who has the great bad luck to treat a criminal and is punished by being sent as a slave to a Carribbean port.  There he witnesses first hand what slavery means to those in chains. Lionell Atwill is Assistant Governor Bishop, a man of extreme cruelty who takes a instant dislike to Blood.  His niece Arabella (De Havilland), though, sees Blood in chains and buys him, and acts smugly superior, thereby insuring that at some later point they will fall helplessly in love.  This is not a film of the growth of relationships between various classes of people, although that is a part of its charm.  Rather what gives CAPTAIN BLOOD its continuing resonance are linked set pieces that enable Flynn to begin a long run of roles that show off his looks, athleticism, charisma, and general star quality.  He is so convincing that no one questions his role as an Irishman, though his Tasmanian accent rings clearly.  Flynn is not an actor of introspection.  In this film, he is always bouncing around the screen: fighting, shouting, exhorting, or taking command of a tough situation.  Regardless of the obstacles he faces, and as a slave and later a pirate, he faces plenty, his evident optimism and rugged machismo must tip the scales in his behavior.  His performance is so dominating that he tends to overshadow the credible acting jobs done by the large cast of supporting actors.  Basil Rathbone as French pirate Captain LeVasseur makes the most of his limited screen time as first the ally, then the jealous rival of Blood. Their duel for possession of Arabella is so well crafted that director Curtiz later would stage a rematch in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. Veteran character actors Guy Kibbee and Henry Stephenson add mightily to an eye-popping brew of piratical excitement.  The visuals of ships blasting away at one another represented the state of the art in special effects, and even today with a generation jaded on computer-enhanced effects, the battle scenes are thrilling and believable.  The real stars, of course, are Flynn and De Havilland and in their inevitably convincing role of sword-crossed lovers, they invest CAPTAIN BLOOD and several future films with a legacy of romantic heroism that modern audiences can still vicariously feel right down to their toes.",1028678400,2,3086,4.9152215799614645

It could easily become your favorite too!",1026950400,2,301,4.137931034482759
427604,5,6302120527,"Here we have the very first adventure of the Greatest Swashbuckler of movie history.
Flynn carries the movie, the trio of himself, de Havilland and Rathbone would appear together again and when they would appear together movie magic was always made.
The sword fight on the beach alone is worth the price of admission.
Sabatini's novel of a doctor sick of war sold into slavery when found treating a rebel is a classic book, it made a classic movie and also made a classic carrier for both Flynn and de Havilland, to the viewing public's great fortune.
Easily worth the price shown and more.",1026518400,,590,4.6826923076923075
427605,4,6302120527,"This movie was Errol Flynn's debut and one of the best swashbucklers of the golden era. Sadly, the genre has fallen out of favor although Hong Kong action is arguably its successor. This movie was based on the novel of the same name by Rafael Sabatini and for the most part stays close to the book. (some of the goofy dialogue was not from the book I am glad to say, the other goofy stuff just sounds odd because Blood is Irish being played by an Australian)
The plot involves a Doctor who is railroaded into a treason conviction and subsequently sentenced to slave labor in Barbados. There he meets the lovely Arabella (played by Flynn's usual leading lady, Olivia deHavilland). Naturally, being the most photogenic people on the island, they fall in love. Then Blood escaps, becomes a pirate but never stops thinking about the girl he left behind.
Flynn is more boyish here than he was in his later roles, he was only in his mid twenties. Both he and deHavilland are a decade younger than their counterparts in the book and act accordingly, they are both much less polite.
This is a very fun movie and while VHS is dandy, I would love to see a DVD. There is a shocking lack of golden era action on DVD and I do hope the situation is corrected.
Essential for a Flynn fan, pleasant for a lover of the classics and one of the better Sabatini adaptations (he wrote Scaramouche, the Sea Hawk and the Black Swan, FYI) this movie offers a solid return for your investment. Oh, and do try the book, it will make you understand the movie better.",1009929600,6,1538,4.457446808510638
427606,5,6302120527,I highly recommend this film.  It is filled with adventure and romance.  It is very entertaining.  Errol Flynn is wonderful in it.,1008374400,,130,4.818181818181818
427607,4,6302120527,"Its action, Its adventure..its about as pure as an Errol Flynn film as one can get. I don't think a Pauline Kael would have spent much time writing about this one....who cares!
Lionel Atwill is frustrated, Miss De Havilland is In love( but not till the final reel). Basil Rathbone was never better as the french captain.
This is the film that put Flynn on the map and you can have fun in picking out the stock actors that would populate Warner Bros films for over a decade.",1001635200,,473,4.386363636363637
427608,5,6302120527,"An amazing movie... gripping and entertaining despite the sometimes rather primitive production. Errol Flynn was fresh off the boat from England and had only about two years of professional experience behind him, yet he  takes over the film and delivers one of his best performances. He was  incredibly lucky to begin his star career with his best leading lady,  Olivia de Havilland; his best antagonist, Basil Rathbone; and his best  director, Michael Curtiz. And it should be noted that Casey Robinson, one  of Warner's best screenwriters, is largely responsible for the film's  sustained intelligence and drama. Technically, there are better Flynn  swashbucklers: ""Robin Hood,"" ""They Died With Their Boots  On,"" ""The Sea Hawk."" But this one has its own special  freshness and sweetness.",964137600,2,789,5.349593495934959

7821404,3,6302120527,"CAPTAIN BLOOD - NON RESTORED WARNER BROTHERS DVD ---  Let Me Start by saying -- I dig the Flynn Man.  Errol was his own man - A real Man.  He Lived his life on and off the screen to the fullest without be two faced or phoney.  He wasn't perfect but neither was he a bad guy.  His exuberance and zest for life shined brightly through in his acting and screen presence.  Out of all his films Captain Blood is one of his earliest and really put him on the map. -- Its the first of his swashbucklers and there is good entertainment to be found here but IMO it is not as good as ""The Sea Hawk"" or Adventures of Robin Hood or Don Juan.  So it depends whether you want to ""See them All"" or see only the best of the best.  To me Errol although good in ""Captain Blood"" isn't spot on and magnificent as he is in the other 3 Flynn films I mentioned. Additionally the film itself isn't as good  ---  As far as the technicals go, as other reviewers have mentioned the film itself is in poor shape exhibiting a lot of damage and sorely in need of restoration. --- Since Robin Hood has already been restored I hope Warner brothers gets off their lazy laurels and restores ""Sea Hawk"" next and follows with ""Adventures of Don Juan"" then maybe do Capt. Blood etc. --- As others have already covered plot I hope this info helps you out.",1518048000,,1317,4.149606299212598
