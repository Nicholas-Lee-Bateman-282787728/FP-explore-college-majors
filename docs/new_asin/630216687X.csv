It was such a mysterious, fun animation that I never forgot about it. Simple, cute and something you can let your kids watch without hesitation.",1112054400,4,262,4.1568627450980395
7822038,5,630216687X,"Also known by it's book title, the ""Miss Switch Mystery Special"" is based on the novel ""The Trouble with Miss Switch"" by Barbara Brooks Wallace. Originally aired in 1980 as part of the ""ABC Weekend Specials"", the premise of the program was to introduce children to various colorful characters found in the land of literature. Hosts from Michael Young to Willie Tyler and Lester the Puppet, all the way to the trademark orange cat Captian O.G. Readmore introduced the cartoon into the homes and hearts of thousands of children. Voice actress Janet Waldo played the role of mysterious Miss Switch, the new fifth-grade teacher who's sudden appearance causes the local class 'brain' Rupert P. Brown, III (voiced by Eric Taslitz) to be a little suspicious. Especially considering all the weird happenings in class. Through some deductive reasoning and sluthy detective-work, Rupert and his friend Amelia (voiced by Nancy McKeon of Facts of Life fame) discover that the new teacher is in fact a real-live witch! Aided by her magical talking cat, Miss Switch reveals that she is in desperate need of Rupert's help as a coven of evil witches are out to destroy her. To find out why you'll have to watch this wonderful animated film yourself. Suffice to say, you'll be at the edge of your seat and wide-eyed by the sheer fun of it all. But don't be fooled by the dark qualities within the plot. The film is for the most part seen through the eyes of the children and pulls out child-like wonder even in adults. A sequel cartoon was soon after made due to the film's immense popularity, again titled by the book of the same name: ""Miss Switch to the Rescue"". Granted the animation is nowhere near the level of some of today's computer influenced graphics, but if you are a fan of a good story and memorable characters, I highly recommend you view this film.",1022544000,13,1847,4.739130434782608
