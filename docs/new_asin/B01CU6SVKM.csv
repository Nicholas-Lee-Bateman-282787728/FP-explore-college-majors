8754180,5,B01CU6SVKM,"It's a little ironic for a guy who wrote a song called ""F* the Police"" to play one, but Ice Cube keeps these movies from being utterly stupid.  Cube and Kevin Hart play so well off each other that the movie doesn't bog down into silliness, and the plots are believable.  There's plenty of comedy and action with a dash of romance thrown in.  This series is perfect for a night in with a bowl of popcorn and a couch full of friends to laugh along with you. The set is worth the money, with some gags and behind-the-scenes as a bonus.",1492214400,,532,4.196078431372549
8754181,3,B01CU6SVKM,"The discs work in my Blu-ray player, but anyone in America, Canada, and Mexico cannot use the ultra violet codes. Read the full description before buying.",1490659200,,154,4.961538461538462
