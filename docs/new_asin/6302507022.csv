My rating of the cheap used copy does not, I think, reflect on the seller but on the lack of wisdom in in purchasing a 25 y.o. DVD in the first place. So instead of contacting the seller I accepted it as a bad gamble and ordered a brand new copy like I knew I should have done in the first place.",1499990400,,483,4.204301075268817

I am not a jew and I also don't have any particular atraction for stories about them, but in my opinion this picture is excellent and that it could be enjoyed by any viewer that watch it without prejudices..
After seeing this DVD I have confirmed that initial appreciation. However I believe now that a key element for the value of this film isn`t so much tthe potential validity of a story with a happy ending, but the excellent performance of all the actors playing the main characters of the story..",1471824000,,618,4.477876106194691

480353,5,6302507022,"One of my all time favorite inspirational movies based on Chaim Potok's classic book. I gave a copy to a friend and colleague of mine who graduated from Yeshiva College in New York. I am not Jewish by birth but grew up, went to school and practice in the health care field with so many friends who are Jewish that I think I have become converted by spiritual osmosis over the past 67 years. The acting in this movie is superb. It is well cast and Rod Steiger has portrayed a rebbi so convincingly that I thought I had gone back in time to the days I knew rabbis just like him who had led large groups of refugees to North America from the cold hostility of Siberia and other Russian and German cities.  The inspiring twist of fates at the end make for a truly entertaining movie that is timeless in my mind. It is also educational in these times when once again the barbaric face of hate is casting a shadow over the Middle East and the civilized world in the 20Teens.",1436140800,,968,4.260869565217392

480425,5,6302507022,"Well, if you love things Jewish, you'll love Robbie Benson in his title role THE CHOSEN. A young orthodox Jewish guy meets
a young, not so orthodox Jewish guy, and it seems like their friendship is doomed from the start. I love how this progresses
from antagonistic, to morphing into a middle-ground friendship, where in the course of time, a real mutual understanding
occurs. In fact, this friendship seems to bring freedom and a better quality of choices available to these two guys and their dads.
Robbie Benson is portrayed as a sensitive, knowledge loving, open minded VERY HANDSOME Jewish guy who has much to
offer in any friendship. It makes you want to talk to him, to know him.",1390176000,,686,4.725
480426,4,6302507022,"The Chosen is a very well made film that explores culture, tradition, friendship and family in ways that enlighten as well as emotionally connect.  While I am not Jewish and am not entirely familiar with many of the traditions explored in this film, the human element is very strong and makes it easy to find yourself engaged from frame to frame.  The story takes place in the 40s and tells of two young men growing up in Brooklyn who are from opposite ends of their religion.  Young Reuven is living a more modern life with his father, who happens to be a professor.  After a run in on the baseball diamond with Danny, who is orthodox Hasidic, Reuvens eyes begin to open, as do Dannys, as they explore each others lives through an unlikely friendship that blossoms over time.  The real force in their lives is easily the influence of their fathers, and while Reuven begins to question Dannys strict upbringing, a beautiful moment at the films end between the two boys and Dannys father Reb is the highlight of the film, and really moved me to tears (Steiger is remarkable here).  I highly recommend this film, for it is historically informative and features some very strong performances (and that score) that only heighten the enjoyment.  I wish that the relationship between the boys was fleshed out as deeply as the ones between them and their fathers, but its a nitpick at this point.",1389571200,,1389,4.668032786885246

This movie made me a Robbie Benson fan. It is, to me, wonderfully done. The friction and stereotypes with in a culture, its resolution is not a neat ""and everyone lived happily after"" ending. The movie has a story to tell with many different insights in a post WW II era. I highly recommend it.",1376784000,,463,4.458823529411765
480483,5,6302507022,"Excellent portrayal and historically accurate account of orthodox judaism in the 1940's. Rod Steiger, a Lutheran himself, played the grand rabbi as well as a rabbi would have.

480484,5,6302507022,"I read the book years ago and just purchased the movie recently (it was one of Amazon's ""suggestions"".)

I enjoyed the movie very much.  I am Jewish, but not orthodox. I've been involved our campus Chabad from time to time and find them very welcoming to less observant Jews. The movie captures the joy and wisdom of Chassidus. The acting is excellent. The movie deals with relationships and living in a traditional culture in a modern world.  I think the movie handled it well.

The only problem I had with it was Danny's father trying to teach his son humility and empathy by giving him the silent treatment. I don't recall that being part of Jewish practice.",1375574400,,661,4.6239316239316235

480486,5,6302507022,"I am a traditional Catholic looking in - but in many ways understanding the Orthodox Jewish position - and Hasidism. The movie presents the tensions between various Jewish sub groups, along with a healthy dose of Father-Son relationships, the battle between religion in general and the world. The acting is superb - Rod Steiger is just great, Maximilian Schell also - who would not want either of them as a father - but for different reasons. Beneath it all is a very human story of how human beings cope with the world around them - and remain the warm beautiful people that they are. The people in the movie have much to teach the world if the world will accept God and His peace. To all my non-Jewish friends; watch this movie and learn.",1371772800,,740,4.529850746268656

480556,5,6302507022,"This film version of Chaim Potok's book, as the director admits in his discussion that accompanies the film, is different than the book itself. He admits that Potok said to him that it is the best ""interpretation"" of his novel. The book focuses on the differences between a very conservative Chassidic family and one that is Modern Orthodox. The first insists upon accepting the literal words of the Torah, the second examines it in a scientific and rational manner. The film and the book both raised an unresolved question in my mind. Despite this, the film is very enjoyable.

 Potok has the Chassidic rabbi raise his son in silence. He refuses to speak to him. In the movie, he explains that he noticed that his son was brilliant and had a photographic memory, what is also called total recall, he could speed read a book and then recite it back to you. The rabbi said that he feared that his son would grow up arrogant. He would be unable to feel the pain of normal human beings. So to teach him about pain, he inflicted pain upon him by not speaking to him. I found this to be absurd, totally contrary to what Judaism and humanity teaches.",1313539200,,1144,4.521739130434782

It is a story about friendships and family relationships; about tolerance and living with people who are different (whether a different creed, race, language group etc.). It is a story about parents and children. I cried in the end when the father, who had raised his son ""in silence"", expressed the hope that his son would forgive him, a rebbe, for not having been a wiser father.

I failed to understand the father's rationale for raising his son ""in silence"". Apparently he wanted to teach his son humility because the son seemed too pleased with his own cleverness: the little boy had been so proud of having memorized a story that he failed to realize it was a sad story. The father thought that only through the pain of rejection (silence) would the little boy learn to experience compassion for others.

I experienced similar ""well-intentioned"" cruelty. I don't think there is ever any justification for inflicting pain on children, whether foot-binding or this form of humbling through rejection and silence. I suspect that my father had, in his own way, attempted to ask my forgiveness, but was too proud to actually do so. That's why I cried when the rebbe asked his son's forgiveness. Significantly, in the reprise, the son tells his friend that he and his father ""talk all the time now.""",1296864000,,1529,4.82824427480916

It's a story about 2 Jewish boys growing up in early 1940s New York.  One is a Hassidic Jew and the other one is Orthodox.  You get a contrast between these two variants of the Jewish faith (Ultra Orthodox/Non-Zionistic vs. Orthodox/Zionistic).  You also get to see why the Jewish faith has had such a civilizing effect throughout the whole world.  This movie is about friendship, about God and family, and the approach/influence of two fathers in raising sons to become 'Tzadikim' - righteous men, with specific focus on Reb Saunders (the Hassidic leader/Rabbi father to Robby Benson's character) special effort.

In the movie, Danny appears so self satisfied and complacent, he is annoying rather than compelling and his portrayal makes me wince. I wish they would remake this movie with a different cast.  And in addition, too many of the important points of the book have been left out, and other things brought in that seem irrelevant.

480664,5,6302507022,"I love this film, and just watched it again for the fourth time!

As others have discussed, The Chosen portrays one of the most Orthodox Jewish traditions, while contrasting a deeply committed but somewhat less traditional approach.  These contrasting approaches to Judaism become the setting for exploring two powerful and ultimately very loving father-son relationships.

Each of the fathers has his own passionately held Jewish connection, which is core to his own identity, and which he shares with his teenage son.  Each son struggles with how closely to adopt his father's cause and calling.

The most compelling focus of the film is on the current descendants in a long line of Hasidic rabbis, Reb Saunders (Rod Steiger) and his son Daniel (Robby Benson).  With such a lineage, Daniel is ""of course"" expected to succeed his father as a rabbi, though his wide ranging intellect has exposed Daniel to more secular ideas, stimulating different ambitions.  He has become fascinated with Freud and the unconscious mind, and is flirting with psychology as his calling.  Daniel's intelligence includes photographic recall, and we eventually learn that his father worried early on that his son might have more mind than heart.

The other father and son -- Prof. David Malter (Maximillian Schell) and son Reuven (Barry Miller) -- devote themselves, each in his own way, to Zionism as it flourished in the late 1940s, when Israel was founded.  Professor Malter's more intellectual approach to his Jewishness contrasts sharply with Reb Saunders', whose approach combines didactic study of Torah with the ecstatic mysticism of the legendary European Rebbe, the Ba'al Shem Tov.  (Though his thinking is controversial even within Hasidism, the singing of the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haneshama-Lach/dp/B0000U38VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haneshama Lach</a>&nbsp;is the embodiment of Reb Saunders' musical spirit.)

These seemingly disparate styles of Rebbe Saunder's Hasidism are presented beautifully in a beautiful, other-worldly Sabbath scene where the men's rousing chanting of 'niggunim' (tunes without words) is followed by Reb Saunders teaching details of some sacred wisdom. (One study of these threads of Hasidism can be found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Word-Is-Fire-The-Hasidic-Masters-on-Contemplative-Prayer-A-Jewish-Lights-Classic-Reprint/dp/1879045257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Word Is Fire: The Hasidic Masters on Contemplative Prayer (A Jewish Lights Classic Reprint)</a>.)  Daniel has brought Reuven to celebrate the Sabbath and his father quizzes the newcomer with the intimidating guile of Professor Kingsfield in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase/dp/B00008UALL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase</a>!

In Reb Saunders' Hasidism, advocacy for the creation of Israel was contrary to the biblical idea that the Jews' return to Zion could come only after the messiah had arrived.  ON the other hand, Professor Malter zealously advocates the socio-political result of a post-Holocaust Jewish homeland.  Thus, another tension is set up between the Saunders' and Malters' approaches.

As might be expected, the more difficult father-son struggle is between the old Rebbe and son Daniel, whom the father disciplines by remaining mostly silent toward his son over several years; pronouncements are made, but everyday dialogue is avoided.

In this excruciatingly painful exercise, we see the age-old pattern of a father struggling to train his boy for a fuller life by severity without words.  (The silence enveloping many men within their families is explored in a different context in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Don-t-Want-to-Talk-About-It-Overcoming-the-Secret-Legacy-of-Male-Depression/dp/0684835398/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression</a>.)  This archetype is hardly peculiar to Jewish men and their sons.  Does such fathering really manifest love?  Does it increase the son's capacity for meaning in the son's life?  Is the game worth the candle?  The Chosen poses these timeless questions exquisitely, culminating in a powerfully climactic encounter.  I have not yet been able to watch this moment of truth unfold without tears.  Indeed, as he was dying, my own father urged me to read this book, as if to communicate his meaning by an indirection similar to the Rebbe's.

The conflicting views of Israel in mid-1900s Zionism reflect two somewhat distinct goals in establishing a Jewish homeland:  creating a new, utopian society on ancient Jewish terrain; and enabling traditional Jewish religious observance free from oppression by the outside world.  These contrasting agendas presage a persistent division in Israeli society -- the split between ""secular"" and ""religious"" Israelis.  At the risk of oversimplifying a very complex society, the face Israel may present to the world might be that of the religious militant asserting God-given rights to biblical Judea and Samaria (i.e., the West Bank).  But this stereotype overlooks the more pragmatic Israeli secularist, focused more intently on simply living a secure Jewish life.

Though Rod Steiger so often seems to over-act his roles, he stays more within himself in The Chosen.  Perhaps he benefits from the thick, gray beard which almost completely engulfs his face!  Robby Benson excels in his portrayal of Daniel Saunders, a surprise for me based on his other work.  He captures the unique style of boy of his rarified background.  The Chosen is often visually beautiful, and Jeremy Kagan's direction is excellent, suggesting a talent beyond the many TV dramas that mark his career.  Elmer Bernstein's music is, as usual, lovely and apt.  A haunting oboe theme lingered in my mind long after the lights went up.",1236038400,,6009,6.017626321974148

For Jews born here, it becomes different, and it's always up to the previous generations to educate their kids in Jewish traditions.  As society evolves, also the Jewish, we have to evaluate those traditions that are distinctive Jewish and those who in a way are old-fashioned and therefore have no real purpose in todays society.

480667,5,6302507022,"First off,the DVD transfer of the 1981 Jeremy Kagan directed THE CHOSEN is outstanding, both in WIDESCREEN and FULL SCREEN.The picture and sound are crystal clear as if filmed yesterday. Great buy for $4+.
Now...the film itself; I saw this wonderful film 3 times in the arthouses in 1981. Jeremy Kagan, who directed this wonderful E.Gordon screenplay adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel, was to go on to win Emmy's for ""Chicago Hope"";but in 1981 he took on the task of assembling Oscar winners Rod Steiger and Maximilian Schell, along with then young talents Robby Benson and Barry Miller,both later Golden Globe nominees,to tell the complex story of two Jewish teenagers and their vastly different fathers from vastly different Jewish sects in 1940's Brooklyn.
The story surrounds Danny (Benson), who is a ""sauvant of sorts"" from the highly orthodox Hasidic Jews and Reuven (Miller), a product of liberal ""Zionist"" Judaism. Danny's father, (Rod Steiger, who won International Awards for this role!), is a ""righteous"" leader who has immigrated to the U.S from Russia with all of his followers. From Danny and his Rabbi-Father, Reuven enters Danny's ""strange"" world of religious ultra orthodoxy and culture. Through Reuven and his father,(Maximilian Schell) who is a ""liberal"" Jew who writes about the necessity of the Palestinian Homeland, Danny enters their world of modern thought and all-embracing Americanism. The two boys form an unusual respect and friendship amidst their incredibly different cultures,and yet both are able to transcend both and forge a bond that will be tested amidst paternal disruptions and the end of WW2.
THE CHOSEN is an intimate film,evenly paced and features truly exquisite acting from the four principle actors. Each character is well developed and reaches an epiphany,which makes for pleasant viewing where everyone learns something. The revelations are numerous and cut deeply into the minds and souls of each character.
NOTE: The author of the book,Chaim Potok, worked very closely with the production of this film and cameos as one of the Talmudic Teachers!
The only other film that deals with Hasidism that I would suggest is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Life-Apart-Hasidism-in-America/dp/B00005JG6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Life Apart - Hasidism in America</a>&nbsp;and to a certain degree&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ushpizin/dp/B000E8QVAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ushpizin</a>.

There are universal themes that apply to any ethnic group: young people who are born into a strict culture but want to see more of life, conflicts between the generations, what constitutes friendship, the relationship of head to heart, the place of silence.

The film achieves a nice balance, I think, between presenting  the ideological concepts and the simple human events.  The cast is first rate; the two fathers and the two sons are all splendid.

I'm not sure why I couldn't assign five stars to the film.  Maybe just because it was so male-dominated that the sparkle that comes with more interaction between the sexes was lacking.

I attended catholic grade school, high school and college.  As I approached 18, I started to meet others of different faiths which I found very enriching given the particular perspective I was given growing up under the teachings of the nuns, priests and brothers who taught me.

What I loved about this film was the contrast presented of mind sets between Robby Benson's character, Danny Saunders, and Barry Miller's character, Reuven.  I was about the same age as these two fellows in the film when it was made.  Both actors are not only good looking men to watch, but their chemistry of interaction is magnetic when you watch this script played out based on Chaim Potok's best selling novel.  Since this takes place in the 1940's with WWII in the works, the tension between the Jewish community and the world is felt and seen only all too clearly, but so is their wonderful culture and their way of thinking which makes this film a post WWII peace ruling tool in my view.  The then tensions in the world is only all too well played out between Danny and Reuven which reduces the greater political trials of the world down to terms all of us can understand.

For these reasons I wanted this film in my library.  The character development is excellent.  Some scenes could have been more developed by today's standards, but it is nevertheless an excellent story with a great message of love behind it.

The DVD case came in great condition along with the slip covers.

480876,4,6302507022,"A book discussion group I participate in read Chaim Potok's THE CHOSEN a few months back.  Since the majority of the group were non-Jews themselves, most of them found the novel fascinating in its portrayal of the complexities of American Jewish life in the 1940s and '50s.  Many were unaware, for instance, that there was a segment of the Jewish community that was opposed to Zionism on religious grounds.

I imagine that many non-Jewish--and maybe even some younger non-religious Jewish viewers of the 1981 film version of THE CHOSEN will find its take on Jewish life in New York equally striking.  To that extent, director Jeremy Paul Kagan and screenwriter Edwin Gordon have succeeded.  The film is a pretty effective introduction to a world that many Americans know next to nothing about.

But admirers of the book will likely still be disappointed in the screen adaptation.  You can't call it heavy-handed exactly, but the film version ultimately can't do justice to the book's complex depiction of a tentative rapprochement between two wildly divergent Jewish sects in the form of an often rocky but nonetheless enduring friendship between two bright but very different teenagers.  It also can only begin to suggest the significant influence of both boys' fathers and how these two men engage in a dialog of sorts through their sons.

Getting all that into 120 minutes of screentime would have been no mean feat, of course.  The filmmakers do what they can, given the limits of their medium.  And the actors do what they can to convey the complexities of their characters' emotional AND intellectual lives.  Old pros Maximilian Schell and Rod Steiger turn in strong performances, and Barry Miller and Robbie Benson (surprise!) are remarkable as the young Jewish boys trying to make sense of a rapidly changing world. It makes for worthwhile viewing, but fans of the novel may still find themselves wanting more.  But how DO you dramatize the plight of a boy raised in silence, anyway?

I imagine that my friends from the book group would find at least one of the film's ""enhancements"" to be something of an improvement, however.  A number of women in the group were understandably disappointed in the near total lack of visibility of the book's few female characters.  They're there, but then they're not there, fleetingly seen, but ONLY fleetingly.  And they are almost never heard from.  Given the culture and the times, this is not surprising.  And the lack of any strong female characters in the novel is a valid artistic choice on the author's part.

But when, in the film, our young non-Hassid hero Reuven develops a crush on his Hassidic friend's sister, the filmmakers had no choice but to give her a bit of screen time and at least a few seconds of dialog.  And of course, that same mini-subplot gives her concerned Mama a chance to come to the fore herself and insinuate herself into the male-dominated plotline.  It's nice that in the film version, there are these hints of what life is like for the female characters that were almost totally lacking in the novel.

And that's one of the things that film can do well--quickly establish a character by a few gestures, a revealing look or a scrap of dialog.  It doesn't come to much, plotwise, but it does remind us that there are closed worlds within closed worlds within closed worlds, all of which would bear closer examination given world enough and time.",1152316800,,3425,4.855421686746988

Don't think that this is just a ""Jewish movie"" and that it has no significance for you.  It's so incredibly human and soulful and you'll learn a lot of practical information in the process.  You'll laugh and cry and be touched deeply by the story.

One person left the comment that the DVD back cover had somewhat of a misguided quote about Reuven ""questioning his religion"".  I'd like to add an alternate perspective to his comment: I think maybe whoever wrote that was trying to constrast Reuven's upbringing with Danny's - being raised Hasidic, Danny wasn't encouraged to question much of anything if you recall.  He was expected to accept his faith and future from his father without hesitation.  It was Reuven who was brought up to think more critically about the world around him, and it was Reuven's influence as a friend that encouraged Danny to spread his wings.  Both Danny and Reuven impacted eachother and each took with them the best from one another's worlds.  What a great story, not to be missed!

I would encourage all viewers to pick up a copy of the book and read it - whether before or after the movie.  Chaim Potok was such a wonderful writer that you will feel a kinship with these boys by the end of the book.  You will then have no choice but to purchase the sequel, ""The Promise"".  Unfortunately they never made The Promise into a movie.  You will be sad to say goodbye to Reuven and Danny at the end of the book, and at the end of this movie, you will want to somehow follow Danny as he turns the corner after that long walk down the Brooklyn tree-lined street.

This story was actually instrumental in my desire to return to school and complete my degree.  I was inspired to action, learning how the Jewish people value education and how they meet the challenge.  They are an inspiration to me.

I tried to contact Chaim Potok to tell him how blessed I was reading his books (he has many others) and found I was two years too late.  He passed away and is buried in Philadelphia.  His wife and daughters still live in the area.

BUY THE DVD ALREADY, WOULD YOU?!

(PS)  For Chaim Potok fans who haven't yet read the Asher Lev stories.... HIGHLY recommended.  :-)",1119484800,,2517,4.455142231947484

480884,5,6302507022,"This is a great movie, but the photo on DVD cover is misleading. Yes, there's a baseball game in the beginning, but the movie is NOT about some Hasidic thug toughing it out with a baseball bat.  Plus, the blurb on the back is wrong.  It says that Reuven Malter is ""the son of a secular father"" who is ""raised to question everything around him, including his own religion.""  Who wrote this?  Some fundamentalist goy who doesn't know that questioning is A BASIC PART of Judaism?  Didn't this idiot PR person know that ALL Jews, religious or not, are raised to question their religion?  The Talmud itself is based on questioning and debate!  Also, Reuven is not ""secular,"" he's the son of a Modern Orthodox Jew (that's a denomination) who writes serious articles on textual criticism of the Talmud.  In the book, the conflict is between two religious sects with different views on how literal to take the Bible, the politics of Zionism, etc.  In the book this is clear -- and so, I recommend you read the book along with the movie to get the full  story.",1107302400,,1051,4.542553191489362
480885,5,6302507022,"Most films made about traditional (Orthodox) Jews

and Judaism rapdily degenerate into stereotypes,

a common example being that religious Jews are

weaklings out of touch with the society around them.

This film is an notable exception.  This is the only

film that really delves into the inner life of traditional

Judaism. We are shown the differences between the

Hasidic and non-Hasidic forms of Judaism, the love

of knowledge and learning, the tension between those

religious Jews who zealously guard all old customs

and attitudes and other religious Jews who are more

open to modern science and scholarship.  Regarding

the stereotypes mentioned above we see how the

Hasidic groups made a point of showing other people

that they could be physically fit.

Other important things brought out in the film

are examples of the strict moral disciplines some

people subject themselves to in order to reach

a higher spriritual plane and even more important,

the different responses traditional Jews had to the

Holocaust and the creation of the State of Israel.

One thing that is really interesting in the film

is the performance of Rod Steiger as Reb Saunders,

the Hasidic Rebbe who is presented as gentle, but

firm. It is hard to believe that Steiger was

offered the role of the arrogant, blustering General

George Patton before George C Scott accepted it.

Steiger must be quite a flexible actor! I also

agree that having seen Maximilian Schell in

""Judgment at Nuremberg"" and ""A Bridge too Far""

where he plays Germans defending Nazis or Nazism,

it is a little hard to accept him as a traditional

Jewish scholar in this film.

Still, I highly recommend this film for someone who

wants to get a fuller view of what traditional

Judaism, as practiced in the United States in the

20th century, is like.",1092528000,,1823,4.9335548172757475
480936,5,6302507022,"This 1982 film, based on the novel by Chaim Potok, himself a Jew,
is a moving and detailed adaptation. Stars Robbie Benson and Rod Steiger. I saw this film on PBS channel 28. The Jewish soul of
this film shines through beautifully and sadly, effectively using Hassidic clothing and glimpses of the lifestyle, which is
oddly at variance with the rapidly modernizing New York City of the World War II Era. Robby Benson delivers a fine performance
as the American young man who befriends a Hassidic Jew and assimilates the Jewish lifestyle. Their friendship is rocky at best. His Jewish friend has been raised by a strict father who
upholds the traditonal and orthodox way of life (he's even got him engaged to another Jewish girl)ad shuns modern thinking. He is against the Zionist movement which sought to make Israel its own free state, but the Father in this film believes only God and his Messiah can deliver them. Never has a movie been more embracing of the Jewish faith and old traditions than this movie.
Hebrew music is authentically used. The overwhelming sadness and horror hits you when they feature clips from the slaughter of thousands of Jews in the Holocaust during Hitler's Nazi regime in Europe.
With a sad, reflective mood and a long run of time, this film does seem to be straight from the equally long novel. But it's a great film and I recommend anyone who is a fan of Potok or Robby Benson the actor. The relationship between the boys and the difference between their fathers- one father is old-fashioned and fiery while the other is peaceful, but modern. It's a look at the difference between the two distinct worlds. In the end, the Jewish boy who always wanted to practice psychiatry, is allowed by a father who finally consents. It's a moving and poignant film. The acting and the script, lifted from the book, is quite good. Why didn't this get any recognition in the Oscars of 1982 ? Or did it ? This film is before my time but it's superb and I feel it's Oscar worthy material. You will see what I mean.",1084924800,,2031,4.613259668508287
480937,5,6302507022,"I just saw The Chosen on TV. I had seen it once before but watched it again. It is a fascinating and well-acted story of the friendship between two teen-aged boys, a Chasidic Jew, and an observant, but secular Jew.
One reviewer complained that Maximilian Schell was too German to play a Jew. I found him very believable as the Zionist father of one of the boys. Rod Steiger as the Orthodox Rabbi was amazing.  I didn't see the opening credits and couldn't guess that he was playing the part. Steiger usually chews the scenery, but here he is very restrained and moving as the father who sacrifices closeness with his son for the boy's own good.
This is a film with many levels that bears watching over again. I have not read the book, and others here have said it is better.  Movies are a different experience, and this one is very good.",1082851200,,837,4.428571428571429
480938,5,6302507022,"I discovered this movie on tv and as time progressed, i couldn't change the channel, it captivated my mind and senses. This movie was sent the mid-40's during the second world war in brookyln, new york. It starts out with baseball scence where danny, a hasdic jew and a modern jew called reuven are segerated into their little team. what started this story off is when danny hits a ball into reuven eye and therefore blinds him temporarily. Their friendship blossoms in which they share their thoughts with one another. Danny is conflicted with his predestined mission of being a rabbi, and studying psychology. This movie makes you think, can you be something other than what you are destined to be? This also made me think : why is it called the choosen? There are many answers to this questions, some of my answers are they are chosen to choose their own paths in life. Their fathers choose their destiny, but they choose what they wanted to do. There is also irony in the end of the story how danny was meant to be a rabbi but reuven is the one that pursues this field, and how reuven's father is a professor but danny is the one who wants to pursue psychology. Although i haven't read the book and compared it yet, i will! This is to say by far one of the best movies i've ever seen!!! Must watch
The only weakness in this movie is how i think reuven acting is too good to be too, there was a scene where danny's father forbid him to talk to reuven and this occurred for several months. Later danny said to danny ""my dad lifted the ban, i can talk to you now"" Reuven's reply was oh ok. My reply is that, if a person doesn't talk to you for several month one would be a mad or a bit angry, wouldn't you? This a minor, not minor,smaller than minor setback from the story. The acting is superb in danny and Reb Saunders and reuven's father. Reuven's acting is pretty good other than my comment, only if he is really suposed to be portrayed to have this kind of characteristic. I wil have more to compare to, after i read the book..",1081036800,,2033,4.324607329842932

480940,5,6302507022,"Granted, as previously stated, the book is always better, but I still think that this film does the book justice. :)
In 1940's Brooklyn, Reuven Malter, the son of a modern, Zionistic Jew, and Danny Saunders, the son of the very orthodox, Hasidic Rabbi Saunders meet in hostility on a baseball field. Even though they are both Jewish in such a turbulent and anti-Semitic time, they both hate each other and yet, they don't really know why. Then they begin to see, that maybe they had a lot more in common than they previously thought. As the film progresses, and the war rages on, Danny and Reuven are forced to fight their own battles and mature to adulthood.
The Chosen is a true eye-opener that teaches a lot about humility, and I remember watching this film when I was very small, only five or six years old, and then realizing that there were people in this world who had to endure pain and silence, then my troubles began to seem so tiny and microscopic. Through this film I learned that as Allan-Gabriel Boyd pointed out that , ""The world needs holy men [and women too for that matter.]"" this film has taught me so many lessons, and I am so glad that I learned them.
Robbie Benson, Rod Steiger, and the other actors did a fabulous job on this film and brought it to life magnificently. :)",1051142400,,1294,4.4641350210970465
480941,5,6302507022,"Judging from the many questions I get through my website's Hasidism FAQ, the book ""The Chosen"" is now a literary classic.  It is being read in high school literature classes all over the world.  Excerpts are a staple in multi-cultural textbooks. So nu -- why is this great movie STILL out of print?  Is the movie industry really so unaware that there's a market out there?  I certainly hope it's going be re-released on DVD sometime soon.
Now granted, the book is always better than the movie, and this case is no exception.  The opening scene at the baseball game, which is many pages long in the book (and is often the scene excerpted in textbooks) is not well-developed in the movie at all.  That's too bad, because the ball game sets up the whole story by showing the deep animosity between the boys at the two schools.  Also, the way that Mr. Malter (Reuven's father) is played in the movie gives the impression that he is a Reform Jew.  In fact, that's what most viewers I've talked to assume him to be.  He's not Reform in the book, however.  Both he and his son Reuven are observant Jews, what would probably be called ""Modern Orthodox"" today.  The Modern Orthodox do not wear traditional garb like Hasidim, but in terms of religious practices (dietary laws, the Sabbath, ethical behavior, etc.) the Orthodox and the Hasidim are not really all that far apart.  This point is made in the book as the story progresses, but is not so clear in the movie, because people tend to focus on the clothes.
In the book, the friction between Mr. Malter and Reb Saunders centers on issues of Talmud scholarship (textual critical vs. literalist readings of the text).  The movie tends to focus more on the question of Zionism.  I suppose the producers felt they had to ""dumb down"" the story to appeal to the general public, but a lot of the plot was lost in the process.
Still, in spite of its faults, ""The Chosen"" is one of the better films about Hasidic Jews.  It would be very helpful to be able to show the movie along with reading the book in class, especially in areas where there are no Jews and the teachers are trying to teach about this novel without ever having seen a Hasidic Jew.  So come on, production folks -- let's wake up and re-issue this film!
(P.S. A bit of trivia: Chaim Potok, author of ""The Chosen,"" makes a cameo appearance as the Talmud teacher in this film.)",1042934400,,2379,4.497674418604651

Through the pain of his father, Reb Saunders' silence, Danny learns one of the rarest of virtues, a deep empathy for his fellow humankind.  His friend Reuvin even picks up a little of it along the way too.  Reb Saunders is right on with his exhortation to the two boys, ""The world needs *righteous* men.""
