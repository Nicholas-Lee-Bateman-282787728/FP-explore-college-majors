4593172,5,B0056YMDX2,"A great collection and highly recommended!

The original with Walter Matthau is gold. Breaking Training, the first sequel, is my favourite as the kids are in control. The third film, they go to Japan which is also great (culture clash of the highest degree!) and then last is the remake. I own the R4 release (and the Jersey slip cover edition) so this disc is surplus to requirements for me, but worth it to get the original trilogy!",1367625600,,434,4.564102564102564
4593173,5,B0056YMDX2,this collection is good for bad news bears fans but go to japan was definitely the weakest. i even enjoyed billy bob's version.,1364428800,,127,4.565217391304348
4593174,5,B0056YMDX2,"Face it, you're really buying this pack for the first 2 movies....the other 2 are just freebies.

My kids love the first 2.  The 3rd movie is pretty bad.  They didn't like the remake and even commented on how much more bad language it had.....I haven't seen the remake and probably won't - really Hollywood, enough with the remakes.",1360108800,2,332,4.593220338983051

8460011,5,B0056YMDX2,"The original Bad News Bears still stands up remarkably well, not just as a fun yarn about Little League Baseball, but also as a document of early Generation X. This is a movie with a lot to say, and it says it all without being preachy, overly-saccharine, or tedious. It really is one of the all-time great movies of its kind, and one that stands high as an example of seventies cinema and all the charms and strengths that the decade gave to us.
Plus, you can't go wrong with the entire Bad News Bears franchise in one single package. Sure, some of the movies are better than others in the series, but it's really great to have all four films in one place. Until these get an HD release on Blu-ray, this is the best way to get all of the movies in the series. Buttermaker would be proud.",1519257600,,788,4.26

I still watched them, and there are some funny parts.  However, I am not sure this something I would watch more than once.",1421884800,,288,3.847457627118644
