I most certainly would not pay $45.oo for a VHS copy... and just who has a VHS player these days?  Just so we're clear - I would however, be willing to fork over the silly price of $45 for a Blu-ray/DVD.  Not happy about it, but I'd be willing.  This great film deserves exposure again.",1445385600,2,437,4.228915662650603

7807665,5,630026355X,"Two films of the Tavianni brothers are to my mind part of this legendary choice . This one and the night of the shooting stars .

This poignant story deals with the efforts of two poor young italians who make this long journey from Italy to the promised land in serach of a better future .

This long and pianful road will lead them by several stages till D.W. Griffith will seal their lives for ever .

But Cabiria ,this masterpiece of Giovanni Pastrone, indicates us we are in 1914 , just in the dawn of the WW1 .

And once more the cruel twist of fate will appear with all the merciless you can imagine and still more .

This is a superior , singular , artistic and original film.",1106006400,4,683,4.183206106870229
