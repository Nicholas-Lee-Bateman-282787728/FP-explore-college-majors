8296764,1,B001E6PI92,"""Sci-Fi High: The Movie Musical"" (also known as ""Farheight High: The Sci-Fi Movie Musical"", which is how the title card of the film reads), has a great looking DVD cover. I recommend you leave it in its cellophane and never watch it, as that's all that's good here. The film is a combination of a 1950s sci-fi monster movie trope and a musical (think ""Little Shop of Horrors"" without the budget, focus, or talent) combination that just doesn't work on any level. Let me say that I love bad movies, cult movies, independent pictures, obscure films, and especially films by newer filmmakers who are just starting their creative journey. I am, therefore, fine with having a microbudget, less than stellar effects, or an occasional wooden performance, but the movie has to have a story arc that interests me and engaging characters. This had a meandering story that's all over the place and is full of horrible actors portraying boring characters.

In a musical the musical numbers need to be a focus, but here the joke is that the lip sync isn't even close. The bigger issue with the music is a strange directional choice (or perhaps a technical problem) in which for whatever reason the songs are all filtered through an echo effect that makes the lyrics frequently completely indecipherable. I watched this a couple of times to try and figure out if that was supposed to be a joke or if the sound production made some kind of horrible irreversible mistake during recording or editing and they had nothing else to use so they just went with this. Either way, do not watch this with a headache as you'll be in agony by the end. In deliberating this, I lean toward the accidental explanation, as there are other sound problems along the way. Sometimes entire scenes are next to inaudible (especially the early appearance of Professor Vadin), and sometimes you wish they were (e.g. the atrocious bathroom stall drama).

There are certain plot elements that I just don't understand. Perhaps they made sense in the original script, but due to cut scenes they now are nonsensical or lead nowhere. A perfect example is the sadistic principal. Why does he beat the boys with a yardstick in detention? What's the point of that again? How does it in any way further the plot, as it doesn't influence any of the action downstream of it? A further issue I have is that much of the dialogue seems unscripted. A little improvisation in skilled hands can work (think Roy Scheider in ""Jaws""), but in an unfocused amateur production can sound the death knell of the movie. Perhaps the best example is the dark rejection scene (""I have to wash my hair."") Perhaps, though, these scenes were scripted and the script is just bad. Either way, when you watch it, it's impossible not to consider the possibilities as your brain will certainly be looking for something else to do given the boring onscreen tedium.

Needless to say the special effects are unbelievably horrible, but I can actually deal with that if the rest of the film is interesting or fun, but here it's neither. At the big concluding Sadie Hawkins Day Dance, Billy Dever (Dan Bellusci), the golden-throated star of the show, works up the courage to sing only to have his big night interrupted by a flailing tentacle and random blood splatter. (Side note: at this point we are 69 minutes into the movie and have our first alien sighting.) Ultimately there's some really (and I mean really) bad evil scientist exposition from Vadin (Ted Nappi) that just made me yawn. I won't spoil the stunning conclusion, but let's just say that Billy undergoes some changes with much drama, all the while resisting his fate. The subsequent non-conclusion fails utterly on all levels, providing zero plot resolution.

For extras, the DVD has three trailers including one for this movie.

""Sci-Fi High"" was a film I wanted to see succeed. In the hands of more mature filmmakers the concept might have worked, but the poor production values, awful performances, and especially the indecipherably echo-laden musical numbers made me just want it to end. I cannot recommend this to anyone, even lovers of films ""so bad they're good"", because this one is just plain bad.",1511568000,,4190,4.805825242718447

8296766,1,B001E6PI92,"In terms of story, it's the 1950s and at FARHEIGHT HIGH, the annual Sadie Hawkins Dance is approaching and half the girls in the school haven't asked the guy of their choice for a date. The class clown and trouble maker, Eddie Cassavette is determined to get the school's prettiest girl to ask him to the big dance. Meanwhile, Cara Ann is thinking of asking Billy Dever, a dreamboat with a voice of gold and self-confidence problems. In school, Billy has a secret interest in science that his science teacher, Professor Vadin, wants to cultivate. On the night of dance, the school is overrun by blood-sucking aliens bent on killing everyone insight and its left up to Billy and his cohorts to try to outsmart them and save the day.

FARHEIGHT HIGH is an extremely low budget movie. For me, that's not such a big deal. I've seen many low budget movies that are much better than most of the big-budget pictures that Hollywood churns out. I applaud anyone who actually makes a movie and is able to get it distributed. It's a major undertaking that most individuals have no idea how difficult it is. However, some people are going to have an issue with the budget because it does affect the sets (Ed Wood seemed to have some better sets than some of the scenes here) and the way the film actually looks.

Chances are that if you make it all the way through this movie, you won't even think about the low budget because there's so much that goes wrong. The movie starts off rather strong with an all-girl musical number that begins in the girl's bathroom. Not long after that, there's a decent musical number with the guys as they are driving back home after hanging out in the country that includes a dreamlike sequence with them flying in their car. However, after that musical number, the movie takes a turn for the worse. The rest of the musical numbers are so jumbled by the terrible juxtaposition of the soundtrack to the film that you can't hear, let alone understand, what the person is singing about. About three-fourths of the way through the movie, Billy Dever sings a great musical ballad, but the instrumentals that accompany the number eradicate almost any semblance the number has to music.

Then there's the dialogue; as the movie progresses it gets worse. It seemed to me that maybe the first fourth of the screenplay was scripted, but the last three-fourths were mostly ad-libbed (and ad-libbed terribly). The special effects, particularly in the last part of the movie, are awful. For instance, most of the time the man-eating aliens appear no bigger than a slug, yet they are capable of ripping men in half (think of the movie SLITHER, but the aliens are only seen as shadows ""rippling"" along a piece of plastic film). Of course, there are other times that the aliens apparently have tentacles longer than an octopus on steroids. Then there's the whole alien who looks like a person. Other than a few moments here or there, the acting is pretty bad, but I'm willing to give the actors a break because the script is so bad they just didn't have anything to work with.

Lastly, there's the story. There are several characters that have no purpose in the movie. For instance, there's a sadistic principal who beats the boys in the face with a rod during detention. Other than providing a way for Billy to have an opportunity to work with Professor Vadin on his special after-school project, there's no reason for the character of the Principal to exist: he doesn't provide any comic relief and he seems completely unnecessary. Of course, at the end of the film the justification for his existence is attempted to be explained, but like most of the movie, it makes no sense.

I'm not sure if the filmmakers were trying to go with the original ending to LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS-vibe or what. However, the ending just doesn't fit. When you have a movie as bad as this one is, it can't end the way it does.

In short, unless you like wasting two-hours of your life and enjoy watching really, really, really bad movies, I wouldn't even visit FARHEIGHT HIGH.

The only extras on this DVD are a trailer for the movie and two trailers for a couple of other low-budget films.",1321228800,,4177,4.628879892037787
8296767,1,B001E6PI92,"Also known as FARHEIGHT HIGH: THE SCI-FI HIGH MOVIE MUSICAL, I picked up SCI-FI HIGH THE MOVIE MUSICAL because I thought it might be a sci-fi parody of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. There have been lots of knock-offs of that popular Disney Channel movie, most of them horrible. However, I thought a sci-fi version would be hilarious. As I started watching the movie, I discovered that this movie is not a parody of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. It is instead, a creature entirely of its own.
