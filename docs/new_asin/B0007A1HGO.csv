They are a wonderful introduction into mission history, and you feel like you are right there with Huell as he narrates. If you can't go to the missions in person, or are planning a visit- then you should watch these tapes first.",1214870400,,368,4.507462686567164

The book is very accessible and provides the essential information fourth graders in California need to complete their mission projects.",1201478400,,254,4.7727272727272725
