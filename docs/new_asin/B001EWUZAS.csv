3557694,5,B001EWUZAS,"A lot of people who want to start doing yoga are not familiar with this ancient art. This video can give a rare insight to what it entails. It can clear misconceptions and wrong advice. An example is in how to correctly do a back bend, from your upper chest and not the waist. This is not a video of a yoga session but an eye opener. Its important to know what one is getting into.",1231804800,12,381,4.026315789473684
3557695,5,B001EWUZAS,The Yoga DVD was very helpful and easy to follow and had great information for beginners.  It was great that they showed you how to do yoga even if you are sitting or laying down.  Very enjoyable.,1231718400,6,196,4.27027027027027
3557696,2,B001EWUZAS,"I wish I could have returned this DVD but your policy is they cannot be opened which does not give you a chance to view it and not be stuck with it. This DVD spent 10 minutes selling the program. I thought there would be more yoga instruction, their life story is interesting but I think it could be cut and show more demonstration. Since I have to keep it, I will skip what I don't want to watch and view the portions of interest to me.",1231632000,2,437,4.0344827586206895

8299724,4,B001EWUZAS,"This would be so much better if you didn't have to watch so much junk before the actual yoga begins.  I love Rodney Yee.  His descriptions really help you get into the correct position, but whoever makes these DVDs bores the viewer to sleep...
I would do a lot more yoga if the video were not so annoying.  Wish I could skip through, but neither of my players let me skip it.",1384300800,,375,4.180555555555555
8299725,4,B001EWUZAS,"This is a documentary about the benefits of yoga hosted by Rodney Yee and Colleeen Saidman. It was interesting, informative, and worth a look. They did demonstrate a few poses, but not as a set or a workout. It was not intended as such, more of an introduction for those who are unfamiliar or intimidated by some of the yoga that they might have seen elswhere.
I know about some of the intimidating yoga out there on the market. When I was just beginning to learn yoga I frequently injured myself by trying to follow instructors who did not slow down enough for an out of shape beginner like me to be able to successfully achieve a pose, or series of poses. I did push myself and eventually I was able to achieve some advanced yoga routines. I learned to honor my limitations by my injuries.
My limitations have changed considerably over the years.  As I have gotten older, (I'm 64) I have found that I have limitations that prevent me from doing the same exericses as I did when I was younger. Most of the challenging yoga wideos have been retired from my library since they are counter productive for me these days and I have found that the restorative type yoga is more beneficial to me now.
This video has value in that it supports our limitations. You don't have to do yoga perfectly for it to give some healthful benefits and add value to your life.",1368921600,,1355,4.4417670682730925
8299726,1,B001EWUZAS,"My mother in law bought me this because the lady at B&N said it was one of the best. How wrong could she be. This DVD goes through only about a 1/2 dozen of the most basic of basic yoga moves. Maybe if you have never heard of yoga or just arrived from another planet will you find something useful on it, but I spent an agonizingly long time watching this hoping there would be something, but alas nothing. Don't waste your money. Colleen is nice to look at for a woman of her age (and the one hot brunette in the audience), but hey; lets face it, that is not why your buying a yoga DVD.  Only what  I care about is look at nice looking girls.",1267488000,5,643,4.015625
8299727,4,B001EWUZAS,"I watched it and followed the instructions, even though I am not at the beginner level. It's actually not bad as an introduction to yoga.

Will you watch it more than a couple of times? Some will probably find that it is a very non-threatening approach to exercise which finally gets them moving. Most of us will probably enjoy watching it and learning from it once and then move on to something that moves faster.

It's funny that I say something that moves faster when I'm always looking for slow-moving yoga practice, but this one moves a little slower than you'll want as a regular routine. It's great for a starter though.",1266364800,,627,4.589285714285714
8299728,5,B001EWUZAS,"UpTooLateReadingBook's 1/29/09, Christa Debarros 1/13/09 & Gitma's 1/12/09 reviews are great. This is a mostly lecture, but part teaching/demonstration of yoga poses. The reasons why people do it, the misconceptions, the mind/body union, the doing less is more, the giving yourself permission to relax will help everyone (it's not a sin), to do yoga to wake up instead of coffee, to prevent/heal backaches & even prostate issues & more.
There are some stories, but mostly they stick to the why's & basic teaching. It's an hour with a 20 min bonus of more poses.
They have the audience participate either using the floor/mats or sitting in a chair doing mountain, sun salutations, cobbler's, cobra, triangle, half moon, camel and relaxation or savasana and meditation.
Normally I get bored very easily, but because Rodney Yee & Colleen Saidman practice being in the now with energy, I wasn't at all, and the program moved at nice fast pace, and was over before I knew it.
This is for people who never tried yoga, or beginners for the most part, but even with the hundred? of yoga dvds I've bought/rented in the past 6 years, and a couple of yoga classes I took, I did learn to put more emphasis in using the upper back in my back bends as well as making sure the legs stay straight & not allow my hips to pull forward to give a fake feeling I'm bending more which puts pressure on the lower back. Also, to always ground with the feet, even in seated poses.
I only wish they spent longer in the teaching of each pose, but that's because I'm so detailed oriented, and probably wished this was three hours long.

8299729,5,B001EWUZAS,"I think that this is an important DVD to watch.  It definitely gives you a wonderful overview of Rodney Yee's mindset and how he approaches yoga, both physically and mentally.  Rodney and his wife Colleen are great to watch together (she seems to make him very humble and light, which is sweet).  It really helped me to see yoga as so much more beautiful and enjoyable and way less scary.  If you are a beginner I recommend watching this and if you are an advanced student it is a nice reminder of all that yoga has to offer besides the physical benefits.",1246838400,2,555,4.411764705882353
