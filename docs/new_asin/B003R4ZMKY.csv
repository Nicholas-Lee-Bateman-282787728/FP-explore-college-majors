4176574,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I was almost in tears when I found out the show was not renewed for a second season. Although I am not a fan of The Family Guy, Fox did not know what it had until it gained popularity after the show was on the Cartoon Network. This is the same this with The Good Guys. FOX, THIS IS THE SHOW WE NEED! GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE!

Detective Dan Stark made The Good Guys - what could have been - the funniest show on network television. With The Office losing Steve Correll, The Good Guys would have taken the top spot as the funniest on TV. With a comedy lineup with almost nothing but crap on network TV nowadays, The Good Guys was a glimmer of hope into moving pass the trashy ""comedy"" shows. This is why I watch reruns of Seinfeld.

Specifically, Bradley Whitford nailed it in his portrayal of Dan Stark. There was one episode, which I can't remember off of the top of my head, where you could tell he was trying a bit too hard. But it was only one episode. Whitford played Dan Stark PERFECTLY.
Colin Hanks did well. He was improving as the season went along, but I think he's the reason why the show did not move further. Hanks was the Achilles heel. The chemistry was just not there. He's a decent actor, but not for this role.

4176575,5,B003R4ZMKY,"This show is at once a callback to old-school buddy-cop action shows and movies, and a complete inversion/mockery of said genre.  Dallas Police Detective Dan Stark is a '70s-to-early-'80s throwback who thinks computers are black magic and is still coasting on rescuing the Governor's son from kidnappers a quarter-century earlier.  He's paired up with Detective Jack Bailey, an up-and-comer still pining for his ADA ex-girlfriend Liz, because Jack made the fatal career mistake of correcting the captain's grammar in front of the captain.  Together they're assigned to the Property Crimes desk, handling all of the mundane, routine, and insignificant cases that the rest of the department turns their noses up at to only to have them invariably snowball into something much bigger: a vandalized hotel vending machine results in shutting down a prostitution ring, stolen dry cleaning leads to foiling an elaborate heist, and a broken street light points towards a car theft ring complete with a mole in the department's organized crime task force.  The way they go about solving all these crimes is hilarious: to track down the car thieves, Dan puts their tracking-ankleted snitch into the trunk of his prized '79 Trans Am because the department wouldn't let them borrow the bait car, and when going up against the second-best assassin in the world during the course of investigating a stolen portable humidifier Jack charges in shooting from the hip with two guns only to miss the assassin completely.  And while Fox was wrong to let it die, at least it got something resembling a final episode.",1297814400,7,1595,5.119230769230769
4176576,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I have to admit, I was skeptical for the first couple episodes, but then the silly fun of this series caught me up.  My husband loved it from the get-go, so maybe I'm just slow.  Delightfully zany and very funny, great cheesy acting and plenty of action and romance - what's not to love??  We never miss an episode and will definitely buy it as soon as it's available on DVD.",1296086400,7,375,4.253521126760563
4176577,5,B003R4ZMKY,"This show definitely got better as it went along. It's a great new buddy-cop action comedy series that'll go down in tv history with Starsky and Hutch. Colin Hanks and Bradley Whitford were hilarious together. Hanks plays Detective Jack Bailey, a young by-the-books cop who is partnered up with senior Detective Dan Stark who lives in the glory days and more renegade. Together, they solve cases that deal with murder, robbery, kidnapping, and much more. I highly recommend THE GOOD GUYS!!!",1292198400,12,490,5.061728395061729
4176578,5,B003R4ZMKY,"The Good Guys is my new favorite show on TV.  I've seen every episode and love it more and more each week.  Great characters, funny stories, a great all around good time!

4176580,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I absolutely love The Good Guys. For some perspective, I'm a fan of shows like Arrested Development, Seinfeld, Community, and Knights of Prosperity. I'm not sure exactly how, but The Good Guys fits in among those others on the same level of awesomeness. It's fun, like TV should be. It's a comedy, it's a buddy-cop action series (in the vein of Lethal Weapon, but lighter), and it's shot beautifully. Aside from Community on NBC, it's my favorite TV series right now. It's really that good.

If you have not watched it yet, please do. You really are missing out on some quality entertainment.  Enjoy!  =)",1288051200,23,604,4.733333333333333
4176581,5,B003R4ZMKY,the good guys is so good that it probably won't last long.  everybody needs to watch it.  it is fantastic.,1285977600,7,106,4.25
4176582,4,B003R4ZMKY,"When I first watched the pilot episode, I was not too sure what to think.  To be honest I was not paying much attention.  A few days later I decided to pay full attention when it was aired again.

Fox is known for bringing unusual series to the air.  The Good Guys would definitely be classified as one of those series.

I did not even recognize Bradley Whitford from West Wing fame. His Dan Stark's character is one hundred eight degree from Josh Lyman.  Stark is one rolled up guy with more issues than a police psychiatrist could resolve in a lifetime, a bit irresistible to women, and a heck of a good detective.

Colin Hanks of Roswell fame plays Jack Bailey, an uptight, by the book, and unhappy in his current assignment.  He finds Stark unpredictable and this trait  gets them into the middle of some bizarre situations with the bad guys.

The romantic angle is ADA Liz Traynor.  She and Jack used to be a hot item, but something happened, but it is obvious the spark in the ashes of their relationship still glows.

Diana Maria Riva's Lt. Ana Ruiz, the harried boss of Stark and Bailey, is always amazed by their exploits each episode.  She does a tremendous job of keeping her persona of the tough cop and hardnosed boss.

The episodes cover a wide range of plots- a stolen dehumidifier, crazy assassins, vintage American cars, vending machine vandalism, dog poisonings, gun dealers, kitchen appliances, stolen laundry, a blue elephant, shrimp, bicycles, good guys and wise guys.  Well written stories and good acting.

Dallas has not had this much attention since Walker, Texas Ranger.  Great outdoor scenery.

Fox is bringing this series back this Fall on Friday night, the black hole for creativity and viewership.  Let's hope it does well with Human Target as the lead-in. There is a Facebook fan page if you have an interest.",1284681600,18,1840,4.69375
8403199,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I absolutely loved this show.  My job was very stressful at the time and this show made me laugh so hard I cried.  Not many shows can do that anymore.  Not many shows are THAT funny.  Canceling the show was a major mistake and FOX has only themselves to blame.  FOX killed their own show by not promoting it well, and later, moving it around so much the fans could never find it.  I will never understand why networks do that.  But I will always be a fan of Bradley and Colin.  They proved just how truly funny they can be.  Too bad FOX gave up on them.  The fans didn't.",1393891200,,571,4.063063063063063
8403200,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I still find it hard to believe ""The Good Guys"" didn't get rewarded with a second series. Dan Stark's catchphrase of ""Let's go bust some punks!"" is firmly into modern culture(with those lucky enough to have seen the series)- quite an achievement for a single series show. This really was the show not to miss in 2010 and the most fun of anything being shown at the time. Good stories, good characters and great actors. Looking back on the series the first few episodes were a bit hazy in their story and character direction but as the show hit it's stride there was nothing to touch it. The brilliant running gags were obviously wasted on the network execs. Fox's biggest mistake of many in cancelling it. Don't miss the DVD (if we ever get one).",1328918400,4,746,4.533333333333333
8403201,5,B003R4ZMKY,"This show was destined to be cancelled. It is far too intelligent for an American public that is obsessed with shows like Idol and Big Brother. The show moves very quickly , so you can't talk while viewing or you'll miss an inportant line. How sad that Fox network had this show. Fox is the worst network on air. Maybe CBS or one of the other networks will have the vision to pick it up. This is rare and excellent tv entertainment. Watch and enjoy !!",1327536000,4,451,4.255813953488372
8403202,5,B003R4ZMKY,"If you've never viewed ""The Good Guys"", and you like offbeat comedy, DO purchase/rent whatever you can of the show. It was hilarious!

I'm like so many other reviewers in being completely, and utterly baffled as to the non-renewal of ""The Good Guys""!!! Along comes an original, extremely funny escapist comedy with great chemistry and humor among its' actors/characters and it gets nixed after one season!!! Bradley Whitford is at his best as a smarmy, Magnum P.I.'ed-mustachioed ""ladies' man"" (in his own eyes), and Colin Hanks is equally great as his by-the-book, exasperated partner. I snort-laughed once an episode, at least, at Mr. Whitford's over-the-top machismo, and was so looking forward to a long run of the show. When I didn't hear/see anything more (after March, or so), I assumed it was not to be. What a shame...a fresh show with genuinely good writing and casting and it falls by the wayside for more c**p like ""Bad Girls Club"" and ""Housewives of ...""; I understand that reality shows are less expensive to produce, but fellas...throw us a bone, PLEASE!!!

(...ditto for the show ""Undercovers""...classy, intelligent, entertaining...GONE!)

Bring them back!!!",1313625600,3,1174,5.201058201058201
8403203,5,B003R4ZMKY,"Imagine all the shoot outs and action of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, but our heroes have about as much respect from their fellow cops as Will Ferrel & Mark Wahlberg do in ""The Other Guys.""  Difference being this: unlike ""The Other Guys,"" ""The Good Guys"" still maintains an air of believability and is laugh-out-loud riotously funny (also unlike ""The Other Guys"").

Detective Dan Stark is a washed-up, alcoholic police detective who the department can't fire because 25 years ago he saved the governor's son.  Hard-working & serious Detective Jack Bailey has just been assigned as his partner as punishment for offending just about every other cop in the department.  These two get assigned the absolute bottom-of-the-barrel cases, which always seem to lead into something more serious than it should.  Episodes have a tendency of ending in giant three-way gun battles and utter chaos.  You'll love the comedy, you'll love the characters, and you'll love the music.  Oh, and did I mention the cars?

Detective Dan Stark is a personal hero of mine, right up there with Al ""Four Touchdowns in a Single Game"" Bundy.  And ""The Good Guys"" is a personal favorite TV series of mine which I would rate as highly as I do Joss Whedon's Firefly.  This show does everything right.  Well... except for the episode where Dan goes undercover.  That was just awful.  While nothing's perfect, this comes close.",1312848000,2,1392,4.948275862068965
8403204,5,B003R4ZMKY,This series deserves another chance.  It is funny and the development of characters is the best.  I want season 1 so I can laugh and laugh and laugh.,1308096000,4,149,4.285714285714286
8403205,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I was a huge fan of The Good Guys. It was the only show I really looked forward to seeing - great acting, fun characters, funny, great feel-good music and decent scripts. What more could you ask for? Bring it back!",1304985600,4,214,4.2439024390243905
8403206,5,B003R4ZMKY,"Another well performed, excellently scripted show that lies in the dust of Fox's very deep burial hole of really great programs that never got a chance to find their audience.  I promise myself I'm not going to watch anything on that station because, unless it's reality tripe, it'll die a quick death.  This absolutely hilarious show kept me laughing out loud nearly the entire hour every week and have to be the performances of a lifetime for this unique buddy team.  Too bad it's gone already, but if you haven't seen it, buy it, enjoy!!!",1303257600,3,541,4.673684210526316
8403207,5,B003R4ZMKY,"Since I have been wondering what happened to one of my (new) favorite shows - ""The Good Guys"" - and just found out on this site that they just might have been canceled - I want to find out what I can do to get them back!  Is Fox nuts?  This is such a funny show on so many levels!  The acting is extraordinary - the writing is great - the idea of having a foot in both the seventies and the 21st century strikes a chord with a lot of us (I think)!  So many of us can relate to Dan...I actually think I dated a few ""Dans"" in my life....Anyway - I just want to add my vote to bring them back for the summer....

Will this review help in any way??",1303257600,4,644,3.7761194029850746
8403208,5,B003R4ZMKY,"I enjoyed this show a great deal, as much for the insane plots as well as the locations. Brad Whitford was great and Colin Hanks was really getting into his role. Oh, did I mention the incredibley hot assistant DA? Every time Fox has a unique show they somehow screw it up (Key West anybody?) and I am just waiting to see what they do with Fringe. Far too intelligent a show to be on this network of liars and idiots!",1300492800,4,417,4.160493827160494
