2655620,5,B000ICM5S0,"This is the first of two Hardy Boys serials that originally appeared in ""The Mickey Mouse Club"".  You will not get ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" on this DVD, just The Hardy Boys segments.  In the mid 1990's the Disney Channel (cable tv) removed some of the MMC serials from the shows and created new half-hour shows of just those stories.  New opening & closing titles were created for these new mini-series.

The then-famous song ""Gold Doubloons & Pieces of Eight"" introduces you to ""The Mystery Of Applegate's Treasure"".  A serialized story loosely based on the first Hardy Boys book ""The Tower Treasure"".

Starring:
Tim Considine (of Spin & Marty fame) as Frank Hardy.
Tommy Kirk (Old Yeller & The Shaggy Dog) as Joe Hardy.

Purists will be disappointed that they are not getting the complete, unedited, hour-long ""Mickey Mouse Club"" shows that these ran in, but fans will still enjoy these re-edited episodes.  However, Disney promises that the teaser episode (which was never included in the Disney Channel re-edited versions) will contain the entire hour long Mickey Mouse Club episode!",1158537600,109,1086,4.9944444444444445

2655628,4,B000ICM5S0,"Wave 6 ends with another Mickey Mouse Club title, this one featuring The Hardy Boys. I wasn't born early enough to have seen these shows first run, but I found it to be a good format and engaging throughout. Once again after watching so many cartoon shorts on these sets, it's a welcome change to see another treasures set devoted to some of the live action shows.

The first disc contains 9 episodes from the classic TV show and some interesting extras. One of them is the introduction episode of TMMC for the series. The other a short feature from Dixon to Disney about how the book's story details were changed(slightly) for the TV show. The episodes here all look very clean with minimal artifacts etc., but the extras seem a little light considering they didn't keep the 12 minute episodes in their original format as part of  the TMMC TV show.

The second disc has the remaining 10 episodes that made up the first serial which aired on the second season of TMMC. An on screen interview with the two young stars Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk with Leonard Maltin and two stills galleries round out disc two.

This is another worthy treasures set, but considering the running time of these two discs, they could have fit the other Hardy Boys story on this set making it a complete series. You woulod think since they took the serial out of the TV show saving lots of room, if would have made a great choice to add the rest of the serial on this set. I hope they will continue and finish the series along with Elfego Baca,  The Swamp Fox and Spin and Marty....looks like plenty of material to release another ""Treasures"" wave to me.",1297296000,4,1633,4.503378378378378

2655634,5,B000ICM5S0,"Recently purchased the Mickey Mouse Club DVD featuring the Hardy Boy's mystery based on the TOWER TREASURE. Had purchased this for eight year old grandson who is beginng to read the Hardy Boy books by Franklin Dixon. We put the DVD in on Christmas Eve for him, but the whole family ended up watching it from beginning to end! We had all seen it when we were kids, but found that IT NEVER GETS OLD! Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk brought the Hardy Boys alive for both us and our grandson! It meant SO much more to be able to picture the Hardy Boys as real people! This DVD is a MUST HAVE! If you liked this, you will LOVE the ""four movie"" Nancy Drew DVD starring Bonita Granville as Nancy. Both the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are in black & white. How do you tell if a movie is GREAT? After the first ten minutes, you become no longer aware that it's not in color! It's so captivating that it actually COLORS your mind!

I sat through two episodes just HOPING the series would get better, but it only got worse!  I couldn't possibly recommend this, and those who were saying that the series were family fare must have a different idea of what is acceptable for a family!

He brings his english butler, an arrogant attitude, and no experience with regular kids.  The story involves horse back riding, a rodeo, camp jokes, and some good old fashioned humor.  You care about Marty (the rich kid) and get pulled into his story.

2655638,5,B000ICM5S0,"I was in 2nd and 3rd grade. Like others, I rushed into the house after school. We were always allowed to watch The Mickey Mouse Club.  The Hardy Boys was a fun part of growing up in the 1950s.

This collectible DVD set containing all the episodes of The Hardy Boys gives me an opportunity to share a bit of my own early school-years life with my children and grandchildren.  The story is clean but adventurous and full of thrills and action.  Kids from any generation will eat up this story. Lucky for my grandchildren--they don't have to wait till the next day to get the next ten minute episode of the story.

Classic Disney is always good. But for the Baby Boomer generation, this is a nostalgic trip back to childhood that will make the aches and pains of 60-something disappear.  It's worth it.  Make it an early pre-retirement gift to yourself.

So what's the down side? You may find yourself wanting many more of this DVDs in the metal tin--Walt Disney Treasures. You can always buy them and claim you are investing for the good of your grandchildren.

2655646,5,B000ICM5S0,"Disney's ""The Hardy Boys"": ""The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure"" (1956) is based on Franklin W. Dixon's (aka Edward Stratemeyer) ""The Tower Treasure""- the first of many ""Hardy Boys"" books. It was the first of two ""Hardy Boy"" serials produced by Disney for its ""Mickey Mouse Club"" show; which was broadcast from 5PM-6PM each weekday. The one-hour show was broken into four segments with this sort of serial taking up one of these 15-minute segments. The ""Spin and Marty"" serials were also used for this purpose.

As in the books, Frank (Tim Considine) and Joe (Tommy Kirk) are the teenage sons of Fenton Hardy (Russ Conway), a private detective. Following in their father's footsteps the two boys are looking for a pirate's treasure supposedly hidden in the Applegate Mansion in their neighborhood. The series has a cool theme song (see below).  Despite the song there are no pieces of eight.  They were one ounce Spanish silver coins, worth 8 reales, or half of a gold dubloon.

Frank and Joe are assisted by Joe's girlfriend Iola (Carole Ann Campbell) and hindered by their Aunt Gertrude who is looking after them while their father is out of town.

The Applegate mansion is a spooky looking house and when the boys finally meet the owner he confirms that there really is a treasure, given to his grandfather by LaFitte the pirate as repayment for when he burned the Applegate plantation. His grandfather hid the treasure and no one has been able to find it since.

The story has gold doubloons and crooks, and Iola gets a lot of scream queen moments.  ""Applegate's Treasure"" was my personal favorite of all the MMC serials. The only drawback is that it was a rather complex mystery with a lot of misdirection, and having to watch it in a cliffhanger serial format was extremely frustrating. No sooner had they cleared up the suspense from the last episode than something would happen and they would break off- telling you tune in for the next episode. But we were hooked and faithfully tuned in day after day. A lot of family plans were altered during this time so as to not interfere with daily viewing.

Watching it now I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the performances by the child actors; especially Campbell and Kirk.  The serial is definitely several notches above ""Spin & Marty"" in what was demanded of the cast, and for the most part they come through.

The DVD has some nice special features including a 2006 interview with Considine and Sands in the Disney Studio where the serial was filmed.  Also included is the entire (hour-long) MMC episode in which it premiered.  It was a Monday, which was ""Fun With Music Day"", and Darlene does a lengthy song and dance number with Bobby.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

""Gold dubloons and pieces of eight, handed down to Applegate?  From buccaneers who fought for years for good dubloons and pieces of eight.  Handed down in a pirate chest, the gold they sailed for east and west.  The treasure bright that made men fight, till none were left to bury the chest.  So now the gold and pieces of eight all belong to Applegate.  The chest is here but wait...now where are those gold dubloons and pieces of eight?""",1200441600,11,3198,4.688729874776387
2655647,5,B000ICM5S0,"MOUSE TV! That was great stuff!

I want to say up front that these five stars are for BABY BOOMERS ONLY!

Don't buy this DVD for your children and expect that they're going to love it just like you did as a kid -- you'd be fooling yourself. If your kids are 5 or older, where they're now socializing with peers, ""The Hardy Boys"" is probably going to be laughable to them. You should go get them some ""Spongebob Squarepants"" cartoons if you really want them to be happy and entertained.

Here's what YOU will get out of it, Baby Boomers: This DVD is PURE 1956-57 NOSTALGIA. It's clean and it's moral, and cloying, and Eisenhowerish. In the introduction, one of The Hardy Boys even set our minds at ease by assuring us that there were NO MORE PIRATES to worry about - that they were all dead (which, like all the Eisenhower propaganda, was not at all true. Modern-day pirates were, and still are, even more vicious and ruthless than the original ones!). It's all about as ""true"" as the name Franklin W. Dixon, the pseudonymish ghostwriters' sobriquet of the original Hardy Boys series.

But we still love our Hardy Boys. Here are examples of what you will see: ultra-clean streets with no cigarette butts or McDonald's trash; white picket fences; Aunt Gertrude with an apron; lots of checkered shirts; china and silver table settings for breakfast, no Cheerios box on the table; a thug/scoundrel/bad guy with really nice teeth; ""conformity wallpaper"" that repeats itself every 3 inches to avoid waste; Fenton Hardy's perfect gig line; and lots more Ozzie and Harrietish gooey parallels. What you won't see is any black actors, typical of Disney. But that was true of a lot of period TV shows so I won't beat him up for that anachronistic omission. But black people aren't much going to watch this show as a result and I wouldn't blame them a bit.

The story? There's a rumor around the Hamlet of Bayport that Old Man Applegate's family came into a big chest of pirate treasure (gold dubloons!) and that the curmudgeony old devil has it buried somewhere on his vast, spooky, and deteriorating estate. Several ne'er-do-wells are after the booty, including a thief,  (a stereotyped IRISH one, of course!), The Hardy Boys, and their female friend, Iola Martin. The boys and Iola set out to unearth this very cozy mystery. Iola is a typical Disney pedaphile's dream. She (played by Carol Ann Campbell) looks like a fully-formed mini-woman, the height of a young girl and with a Munchkin voice. She has supple lips, big dark cow-eyes, long eyelashes, a perfect nose, and a slightly weak chin to emphasize her prospective submissiveness to Alpha-males.

The Hardy Boys live with their dad, Fenton Hardy, (the younger Hardy Boy runs outside and actually HUGS his dad when he arrives home from work!) and with their Aunt Gertrude. Why no mom? Because the boys disobey her with some frequency and, in that era, encouraging youths to disobey their moms would not have gone over so good... but an AUNT can be disobeyed to a degree without much social consequence. Anyway, that's pretty much the entire basis for the story.

There were ultimately only two Hardy Boys stories, parceled out in episodes, on The Mickey Mouse Club; this one and ""The Mystery of the Ghost Farm,"" which ran later. This entry, ""The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure,"" aired in 1956-57 over four weeks. There is an introduction plus 19 episodes (each is about 10 minutes). The particular Mickey Mouse Club episode which introduces this Hardy Boys story is included in its entirety, (we get to see Annette Funicello's chubby little legs!), albeit, you have to bring it up via ""features"".

There is also a contemporary interview with Tim Considine (who was also in ""Spin and Marty"") and Tommy Kirk about the series. Finally, this two-disc set additionally includes a ""photo gallery"" and some photos of Hardy Boys memorabilia. Disney has grossly over-packaged the DVDs in a regular plastic case which is housed within a metal, pop-apart case, making it inconvenient for storing on your DVD shelf. I recommend throwing away the tin case. This is a LIMITED EDITION (a nasty Disney marketing trick) and so 65,000 of these DVD packages are being issued for now. So if you MUST have one, you'd better go ahead and order it before the scalpers gain control of the pricing. The package also includes a cardboard mini-cover from a Dell Hardy Boys comic book and an informational booklet which mostly promotes other Disney DVDs.

The crystal clear black-and-white image is full-screen and all the opening sequences (episode openings) were snagged from the movie ""Treasure Island"". Almost ALL of this series was shot inside of Disney's Studio #2 at Burbank, California. This is affirmed when you see Fenton Hardy enter his home and his shadow is cast against the face of the house (away from the viewer) while the shadow from the picket fence is cast upon the sidewalk in front of the house, (toward the viewer) in the opposite direction!

You will get pretty sick of hearing the ""Gold Dubloons"" introductory song, sung ad nauseum by the same guy who did the voice of Tony the Tiger. Each of the 19 episodes offers this introduction with full credits also being scrolled each time.

Once you get past the Disney packaging fluff, this is a very nice presentation that anyone who fervently watched this series when it originally aired will love. If you have any more questions about the product, just pose them in ""comments"" (below), and I'll try to field your queries.",1200096000,8,5514,4.8048523206751055
2655648,5,B000ICM5S0,"From the second season of the original Mickey Mouse Club comes the hit serial ""The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure"" in this wonderful Walt Disney Treasures 2-disc set! Starring Tim Considine (of Spin and Marty and My Three Sons fame) as Frank Hardy and Disney legend Tommy Kirk (star of The Shaggy Dog, Old Yeller, Misadventures of Merlin Jones, and a host of other Disney faves) as younger brother Joe Hardy, the two Hardy brothers are preteens growing up in the suburbs on their Aunt Gertrude's watch while their detective father spends most of his time at work in the city. Out for the summer, Frank and Joe want nothing more than a mystery of their own to solve, and when they meet Perry Robinson, an unlucky new kid who is struggling to stay out of reform school and keep his job working for old Mr. Applegate, they find their first client! Determined to prove that Perry is a victim of circumstance and foul play, Frank and Joe soon find themselves caught up in a near forgotten case of missing pirate treasure. At first, no one else in town even believes the treasure exists other than Mr. Applegate, the rightful owner, but when suspicious characters begin to come out of the woodwork, everyone starts to take an interest!

The Hardy Boys in ""The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure"" is classic Disney fun for the whole family. Tim and Tommy are wonderful, but particularly scene stealing is the adorable Carole Ann Campbell in the role of Iola, the roller skating neighborhood girl with a crush on Joe who wants to be a Hardy Boy too! She is literally too cute for words! Despite the 1956 air dates, the story remains engaging and suspenseful, presented here for the first time out of the Mickey Mouse Club context and back to back in glorious black and white. There are 19 episodes that make up the story, each just under 12 minutes long. Disc One holds the first 9 installments, plus the full episode of the Mickey Mouse Club that introduced the series. Disc Two holds the remaining 10 installments.

As usual with the limited edition Walt Disney Treasures Collection sets, The Hardy Boys comes in a collector's tin and includes a certificate of authenticity, a booklet, and a postcard sized collectible artwork, this one being a Hardy Boys comic book cover reproduction. Some wonderful bonus features are included on the discs as well. Both discs are hosted by Leonard Maltin, and Disc One holds the featurette ""From Dixon to Disney,"" while disc two holds ""The Hardy Boys Unmasked"" and two fine galleries of photos and merchandise. As one might guess, ""From Dixon to Disney"" is all about the origin of the Hardy Boys as a book series and Walt's translation of the stories from books to small screen. There's some very interesting information to be found in this featurette. No less interesting and very heartwarming to watch is ""The Hardy Boys Unmasked,"" which is essentially a reminiscent interview with Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk today. Also worth describing is that aforementioned Mickey Mouse Club episode included on Disc One. For those curious, this episode is the first of the second season and includes a Mickey Mouse Newsreel in which two children visit the USS Nautilus, the first atomic submarine, a Fun With Music intro and Coney Island number starring Darlene and Bobby, the Hardy Boys introduction in which Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk explain the serial that will be debuting on the next episode of the Mickey Mouse Club, the cartoon ""Mickey's Rival,"" and a poetic moment with Jimmie Dodd, head Mouseketeer. Also worth mentioning is that this episode introduces Mouseketeer Cheryl Holdridge (not to be confused with the Cheryl who visits the USS Nautilus). Why is this worth mentioning? Because, for those of us guys who watched the Mickey Mouse Club as kids (myself decades later, on the Disney Channel), most of us either crushed on Annette or Cheryl. I was a Cheryl man myself.

In truth, I would prefer to own all these Mickey Mouse Club serials within the context of the Mickey Mouse Club shows released in complete season sets (in volumes if need be). However, I can also see the value of owning them in sets like this, where one can sit and watch the complete serial uninterrupted except by the enjoyable opening pirate song and credits. Without a doubt, fans of ""The Hardy Boys"" should consider this set a must-own, especially since there's no sign of Mickey Mouse Club complete sets being released anytime soon!",1199836800,8,4465,4.796103896103896

While the production quality can not compare to today's films, the revisiting of an earlier time when your imagination and emotions were going full tilt is simply fun.",1197331200,3,538,4.78494623655914

However the ""Gold Doubloons & Pieces of Eight"" song at the beginning of each episode did get a bit annoying (that's what God made Fast-Forward buttons for). Any Hardy Boy Fan will appreciate this Series. I found the special Features to be educating as well as entertaining. However, I got the impression that during the reunion of Tim Considine (Frank Hardy) and Tommy Kirk (Joe Hardy), that Tim Considine acted as though he would rather be somewhere else.",1193961600,2,719,4.5813953488372094

2655653,5,B000ICM5S0,"I was not around when this seris debuted on The Mickey Mouse Club in 1955. The 11 minute 19 episode series was a cliffhanger and a trememdous daytime success airing every Mon-Wed and Fri. It was only recently after I purchased the dismal 1977 pop culture retread that I bought a used set. But it's a winner. Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine are more true to author Dixon's original creations and the series has been extracted from the orignal MMC shows and put together on a limited 2 disc set housed in a collectible metal case with certificate of authenticity, color photo and other goodies. The discs contains the original complete Micky Mouse Club show where Kirk and Considine introduce the series--but viewers beware, it's a spoiler and I suggest you watch the series first. There is also more bonus features including critic Leonard Maltin and a reunion some 50 years later with the original stars which much be jolting to those who remember watching the episodes when they first aired. Kirt who was under contract to Disney declared himself openly gay in 1962 and appeared to slowly disappear from sight. I never followed his co-star's career but found this series much closer to author Dixon's creation (this series is based on his books) than the latter TV counterpart featuring teenybopper Shaun Cassiday who sings his bubblegum hits in the middle of a story. I found this dated. However this Disney series is classic and they never grow old. The series also feature some of the Mousketeers in roles. Since I bought this used, I would like to know what I am missing off the back of the tin box. Another confusing item is on the front of the cover stating the series ran for 56-57? Was there a second series? If so, let me know! I am sorry I wasted the money on the newer series, but it did lead me to this little treasure and unfortunately like all Disney features, they are limited editions and will be pulled out of circulation for years. So get it while you can. Completely enjoyable and as the ""Club"" tells us ""Come back soon--why? Because we like you (The Hardy Boys). What nice memories this must bring bring to many folks.

2655654,5,B000ICM5S0,"My two sons and I just finished watching my Father's Day gift - Disney's Hardy Boys DVD. They were thrilled with it - covering their eyes during exciting/scary moments, laughing at the jokes, singing along to the infectious theme song.
I love the fact that my boys - ages 6 and 7 - can get so much enjoyment out of a 50-year-old TV serial. With all the Spongebob, Drake & Josh and other modern kids' shows they watch, it pleases me that they can appreciate ""classic"" shows from decades past. This includes shows from my youth - Scooby Doo, et. al. - as well as stuff that predates me - Huckleberry Hound, Johnny Quest, Casper the Ghost and, now, The Hardy Boys.
As soon as it was over, they asked if there were any other Mickey Mouse Club serials we could get. The Spin and Marty DVD will probably be an upcoming birthday or Christmas gift.
Bottom line, this is a great, fun, wholesome show that most elementary age boys will love - and maybe some moms & dads too.",1182297600,6,964,4.361111111111111

Atomic energy was still our friend, Korea was over and Vietnam had not yet started; the space race was about to begin, and Ford offered us two classics: the Fairlane and the T-bird.  Considine and Kirk gave us relatable performances as Frank and Joe Hardy.  Despite an obviously limited budget, the show was well-crafted and holds up in back-to-back viewing (as host Leonard Maltin acknowledges).  A flood of memories came back to me when watching this (I hadn't seen the Disney Hardy Boys since their original air dates), and yet more than nostalgia compelled me to smile.  This was classic work from the Disney studios, all the more amazing since it was mostly shot on enclosed sets!  The extra features are a little skimpy, but the interview with Considine and Kirk as they are today, almost makes up for that.  This will sit proudly on my shelf next to Spin and Marty.

This Hardy Boys has the Disney flair and was  adapted it to the small screen well. It barely dates itself, a showcase of a project well done

The masters recording of this collection  are clean and crisp, cleaner than most older shows and movies I have seen lately . Disney has made sure of it being great for the treasures collection

I remember watching this and not missing a day when It was on. I like the 80's Hardy Boys too, but this one is done better.

The extra stuff on the DVD is the intro episode of the Hardy Boys from the MMC, Showing how Disney transfered the book into Disney TV show and an all new interview with the actors who played the Hardy Boys

All I hope is that Disney soon will release the second Spin & marty, Annette and Hardy Boys serials from the MMC, the rest of Swamp Fox episodes, all of Texas John Slaughter...and place their first season of Disney's Zorro from their movie club to the general public

2655661,4,B000ICM5S0,"This volume in the Disney Treasures series features the first of two serials from the Mickey Mouse Club about the Hardy Boys.

Frank and Joe are looking for some excitement in their summer.  They're disappointed when their dad is too busy with his own case to find a mystery for them to solve together.

But mystery seems to find them anyway.  The new kid in town, Perry Robinson, is in trouble.  He's spent some time in reform school and the natural suspect when tools in the neighborhood disappear.  Even more mysterious is the old gold coin he's found.

The coin resurrects the rumors in town of treasure.  Old Mr. Applegate is rumored to have once had a fortune in pirate gold.  He claims it was stolen years ago.  Is this a piece of the treasure?  If so, where is the rest of it?

When wave six of the Disney Treasures was announced, this was the one I was looking forward to the most.  After all, I've been a Hardy Boys fan for years.  I must admit I had a hard time getting into the series.  For starters, the boys were younger then I expects.  I'm used to the late teens of the series and here they seemed early teens.  Plus, the story starts rather slowly.  However, once it got going, I enjoyed it.

This two disc set contains all 19 of the eleven minute episodes that contain the story.  They are shown in their original black and white, but look and sound good for being 50 years old.  Additionally, we get the entire Mickey Mouse Club episode that introduced this series.  It's best to watch this last since it spoils some major events of the story.  In the way of extras, we get a documentary that discusses the path it took to get the characters from the page to the small screen and a modern interview with stars Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk.

This series isn't perfect, but I enjoyed getting to watch the Disney take on these well known and loved characters.",1169337600,30,1875,4.399416909620991

2655668,5,B000ICM5S0,"This DVD set was a Christmas gift from my 22 year old son.  For years I held out hope that the Disney folks would understand how strong a memory their Mickey Mouse Club serials (Spin and Marty, Corky and White Shadow, and the Hardy Boys) were to children of the 1950s.  There is no question that those daily episodes made me a Hardy Boys TV fan and, in turn, a Hardy Boys books reader.  I read 45 or 46 of those adventure/mystery books, and when there were no more to be found, I wrote my own on my dad's Smith-Corona manual typewriter!

If you ever pretended to be a sleuth; if you have memories of flashlight beams cutting through the darkness and bony tree branches scratching your window on a windy, moonlit night; if you recall the innocent era of black and white TV or if you ever read a Franklin W. Dixon book, you will certainly want to add this DVD collection to your life.

2655669,5,B000ICM5S0,"I grew up a child of the 1970's, and was riveted to ""The Hardy Boys - The Mystery of The Applegate Treasure"" in reruns of ""The Micky Mouse Club"" which were airing on a local station. I would tune in daily, and I think they only showed ""The Hardy Boys"" serial once a week (it was originally shown three times a week) and I still recall the stir of excitement which I felt when they skull and crossbones came on screen of the Hardy Boys introduction. By contrast, though I faithfully sat through ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" each day, it was always a little feeling of disappointment when the show aired without a ""Hardy Boys"" installment. Anyway, all this is one of the few of my early television memories which I have not been able to revisit until now (I don't have the Disney Channel).

Thanks to Leonard Maltin's always superb treatment, I can say that for me, revisiting the show after more than 30 years has not been a letdown in the slightest. Sure, the story is a bit on the simplistic side, but the fine acting and ultra-atmospheric sets (often at night) take me back not only to my childhood, but to an earnest time in the US when al-Qaeda wasn't a household word. It has been more fun for me to revisit this installment in Maltin's ""Walt Disney Treasures"" series perhaps than any other.

The extras are fun, though I wish there were more. It's great to see Considine and Kirk reunited after 50 years and it's nice that they seem to genuinely get along so well.

I remember ""Spin and Marty"" which was decent (and also fun to revisit in another Maltin DVD set), but when it comes to the MMC serials, it is this one which I will always remember most fondly, and which to me holds up the best.",1167004800,51,1694,4.371428571428571

8145219,4,B000ICM5S0,"Wave 6 ends with another Mickey Mouse Club title, this one featuring The Hardy Boys. I wasn't born early enough to have seen these shows first run, but I found it to be a good format and engaging throughout. Once again after watching so many cartoon shorts on these sets, it's a welcome change to see another treasures set devoted to some of the live action shows.

The first disc contains 9 episodes from the classic TV show and some interesting extras. One of them is the introduction episode of TMMC for the series. The other a short feature from Dixon to Disney about how the book's story details were changed(slightly) for the TV show. The episodes here all look very clean with minimal artifacts etc., but the extras seem a little light considering they didn't keep the 12 minute episodes in their original format as part of the TMMC TV show.

The second disc has the remaining 10 episodes that made up the first serial which aired on the second season of TMMC. An on screen interview with the two young stars Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk with Leonard Maltin and two stills galleries round out disc two.

This is another worthy treasures set, but considering the running time of these two discs, they could have fit the other Hardy Boys story on this set making it a complete series. You woulod think since they took the serial out of the TV show saving lots of room, if would have made a great choice to add the rest of the serial on this set. I hope they will continue and finish the series along with Elfego Baca, The Swamp Fox and Spin and Marty....looks like plenty of material to release another ""Treasures"" wave to me.",1378339200,,1631,4.503378378378378
