8289383,5,B001CU7WDK,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504137600,,463,4.948717948717949

8289385,5,B001CU7WDK,"I originally watched only part of this History channel show as a result of random channel surfing.  What I saw was more than sufficient for me want my own copy.  I wasn't disappointed at all with the complete video.  You see, I live in the Philly area, in fact, I live just down the road from the haunted, ""The Crier in the Country"".  So, I have a personal interest in the local lore of Chester County, Philadelphia and the surrounding environs.  ""Haunted Philadelphia"" is a very good, fun, introduction to the paranormal folk lore of a very historic region.  Right now, a friend of mine is borrowing my DVD and another friend is on the ""loan list"".  It's definitely a popular DVD and a good one to have on hand at Hallow'en season.",1316736000,3,732,4.458646616541353
