I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was very enjoyable.",1253577600,3,298,4.245614035087719
2811850,3,B000P6R5JS,"Well know where to begin? Madlax is a rather unquic story about an orpahned millenare heiress named Margret Burton whom lives in a peaceful country that resemples France or Itally and a young amazingly skilled female mercinary named Madlax that lives in a war torn central American country. How are these two contected? Why are they even in the same story those are but a few of the questions the series posses.

Let me start off with the good. The formost of the good colemn has to most definately be the animation and artwork. Both are top natched, both still shoots and movement are portrayed smoothly and edge on being called pretty. The voice acting is also quite good as everyone suits their parts and do an admirable job at their parts. The characters developement that does happen in the series is quiet good and interesting to a degree. Lastly in this collem is the music. Like Noir, this ones sister series of sorts the music is some of the best around.

Alright did anybody notice that the plus collem was rather small this time? Well you're about to find out why. The first and most jaring flaw I have to pick at is the series almost instiance on sad endings. Every character meets with a less then happy ending. As a person who loves happy endings, or sad endings when they fit, this anoys me to no end. Next I have to say is that the series tries to hard to pres the mystery and suspense factor to the point where you just don't care. Next is the Character Developement, which is greatly neglected in this series. Many of the characters I would have loved to know more about but sadly am never allowed. This series focuses almost exclusively on its plot. Which wouldn't be a bad things if by the time the plot actually started to reveal itself make become interesting I was bordering on not caring anymore. In short the pacing of the series is just to slow. Not enough is going on to keep you interested. Lastly the few action scenes that there was in the series were badly chorographed, came across as overly thought out and some just bizare. Considering this is an action series as well as a mystery series I was expecting to be impressed by more then one fight in the entire thing.

In the end Madlax plays out like Noir's red head little brother that no one cares about. My advice is if you don't have Noir or have not seen it do so, its a much better series. If you have seen Noir but still want better then average girl's wth guns that just happen have a brain stuff, well those are in short supply and next to Noir this is the best. Still I cannot bring myself to suggest everyone to buy this series. Again I have trouple supporting buying this one, there are such better series out there for this genre. If you want girl's with guns with brains get Noir. If you want girls with guns cool action, get Burst Angle. And if you want girls with guns that make you feel get Gun Slinger Girl. If have all those and can snag this for less the 30$ get it, if not, well you can forget this even exists and you won't miss much.",1229990400,12,3038,4.354497354497354
2811851,5,B000P6R5JS,"This anime is very serious and explains a very complicated story.  If you do not have the energy or time to make through the 1st disc then do not get it.  If you do, you will really enjoy this story.  The artwork is wonderful and the characters are well developed with a cool twist at the end. This is a great box set for any anime collector!",1229817600,7,342,4.074626865671642

8189225,4,B000P6R5JS,"This anime series has a twist at the end.  I had half of it figured out, but was surprised by the end.  I don't know why it's priced higher than Noir and el Cazador de la Bruja (Witch Hunter).  Noir was better.",1437955200,,210,3.9523809523809526
8189226,3,B000P6R5JS,"Story started out OK, but tended to drag in spots. Ending was a little confusing and slightly disappointing. (Some anime stories have a strange tendency kill off a likable supporting character or two that seem unnecessary to the plot and leaves a semi-sad conclusion). Madlax is one of those type of yarns. Would rate it maybe 6 out of 10. Graphics were above average. The NOIR DVD series was much better!",1437523200,,405,4.71830985915493

8189228,5,B000P6R5JS,I own the first two episodes of this series and i had to get this series. Looks great and the action in it is well done. A+++!,1354665600,,126,3.7037037037037037
8189229,5,B000P6R5JS,"The Second set in the ""girls with guns"" trilogy is just as good as the first and third. My ranking on this series of sets set is: 1. Noir, 2. Madlax, and 3. El Cazador. All three DVD sets hit the bulls eye and are really good purchases. Madlax has some really good music in it too. The only thing I could argue with in Madlax is the price on it being a bit higher than the other two. But even with that, money well spent!!",1317513600,6,422,3.9186046511627906
8189230,5,B000P6R5JS,Madlax is one of the best Animes I've seen.  The characters are well drawn (without excessive fan service) and the voice acting is excellent.  The plot is a bit complicated but well worth the investment in attention.  Not for young kids (quite a bit of gun violence although not graphic).,1280361600,6,288,4.72
8189231,1,B000P6R5JS,"I can barely even think where to begin...
An absolutely terrible storyline, terrible characters, terrible action scenes.  The story makes no sense, no sense at all.  Some airhead assassin, who can kill entire armies effortlessly, is somehow spiritually connected or something to an even more dimwitted rich girl in a different country.  I couldn't even finish this it was so painful.  Only buy and watch if you want a brain aneurysm.  I can't give this show a low enough rate...",1275436800,2,478,4.925
