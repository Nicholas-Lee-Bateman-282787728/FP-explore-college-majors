2604811,5,B000GDIBQG,"This movie is excellent on so many levels.  The acting is first rate, and the subtitles (necessary for me, as someone who doesn't speak Japanese) are very good, supplementing the masterful performances of some very talented actors.  In assuming that the events portrayed are historically accurate, the drama derives from reality rather than the pen of some screenwriter.  It too is outstanding.

But my personal interest in this, and similar movies, is in trying to understand the nature of Evil, and how it comes about, in otherwise good and decent human beings.  For instance, the Minister of War was portrayed, at first, as an unflinching hard-ass, seemingly beyond the pale of any human compassion or concern for the suffering of the Japanese people.  Later, we learn that his rigidity originated from the fear that the Japanese people, in defeat, would be utterly destroyed.

After two cities had been vaporized by atomic bombs, it must have seemed that the people's destruction was inevitable, one way or another.  And then again, the Japanese strategy after the defeat at Midway, was to lure the American's into a massive final battle on the Japanese mainland, which would be so costly to the Allies that they would have to sue for peace on Japanese terms.  The notion of maintaining the status of the Emperor had been paramount in all considerations of ending the war.  Together these two considerations had become military dogma, which brooked no heresy.

Most susceptible to such doctrinaire thinking were the young Japanese officers stationed at military headquarters.  For some, their allegiance to the militaristic mantras of ""honor and duty"" outweighed their loyalty to emperor himself.  It was in the ranks of the younger officers that the insurrection of August 15th began, and nearly succeeded in scuttling the plan to surrender.

The whole show was a study in misguided morality and absolute madness.  But it has parallels in the wider world today.  Among religious zealots, it seems justifiable to kill those who do not hold the same beliefs as Truth.  A mother can kill her young children for fear that as adults or adolescents, they become corrupted, and spend an eternity in Hell.  Some militarists today would preemptively invade non-aggressing nations out of fear that the ""enemy"" would soon have weapons of mass destruction.  The result is the same - Evil triumphs - often in the name of protecting the good.  The love of money may be one root of evil, but fear and terror are others most pernicious.

What is not covered in this movie, but is still important to an understanding of how evil became so deeply infused in the Japanese psyche, is the long history of warfare and political and social intrigued that plagued that nation for a millennium prior to the twentieth century.  Absolute loyalty and unquestioning subservience to one's superiors seems to have given rise to the dogmatic and inflexible manner in which the Japanese waged war.  The willingness to die for the Emperor became a morbid ""virtue"" which outweighed the individual's instinct for survival, thus discouraging the more creative impulses which the Allies used to great advantage.  Thus, if societies evolve in the same manner that plants and animal do, imperialism, monarchies, feudalism, and even oligarchies should largely disappear as civilization progresses.",1342915200,2,3361,5.113553113553113
2604812,4,B000GDIBQG,"A longish film, and a touch ""stagey"" at some points, but good handling (in an almost docu-drama way) of the looooooooooooooooong day leading up to the Emperor telling Japan ""we're done"".

While I'm familiar in only the broadest of strokes about Japan's wartime history, I never knew how close a (what amounted to) coup d'etat came to succeeding.

2604813,5,B000GDIBQG,"The movie certainly wasn't favorable to the military maniacs who wanted nothing to do with the Emperor's attempt to surrender.  It's worth watching just to see that perspective.

It deals with how the last B-29 mission caused a blackout in Tokyo, which inadvertently interfered with the military's attempts to find the Emperor's recorded message of surrender (which was to be played to the Japanese people).",1304208000,3,644,6.642857142857143
2604814,5,B000GDIBQG,"Like many Americans, I always had the idea that Japan's surrender was pretty immediate following the dropping of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki.  However, Fat Man was dropped on August 9, and the country did not officially surrender until August 15.  That is six days of doubt, debate, folly and insurrection.

""Japan's Longest Day"" (a direct translation of ""Nihon no ichiban nagai hi"") is not actually the story of a single day.  It begins shortly before the first bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, and finishes at the Emperor's surrender speech on August 15.  The bulk of the story, however, takes place during the long dark night of August 14, when the fate of the entire nation truly hung in the balance.  If things had gone only slightly differently, there might be no Japan today, at least not as we know it.

It is a testament to the skill of director Okamoto Kihachi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-of-Okinawa/dp/B000V1Y45K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle of Okinawa</a>) that even when the story is a matter of historical record, ""Japan's Longest Day"" is still full of tension and drama.  Okamoto even manages to stick pretty closely to history.  In this case, the real thing was enough.

The story has been done before, most recently seen in Russian director Aleksandr Sokurov's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sun/dp/B000WQVUKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sun</a>, but never with such scope and drama.  Each of the major players is given a full story arc, including the leaders of the failed insurrection that attempted a military coup de tat in order to prevent Japan's surrender.  How they could do this in the face of more atomic bombs seems like madness, but it is madness such as when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-of-the-Kamikaze/dp/B001HM2CEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father of the Kamikaze</a>&nbsp;Onishi Takijiro begs for just twenty million more suicide troops to fling against the American army.

As Toho Studio's 35th anniversary production, ""Japan's Longest Day"" stars pretty much ever one of the greatest actors from Japan's Golden Age of cinema.  Kurosawa Akira favorites Mifune Toshiro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>) and Shimura Takeshi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ikiru/dp/B00005JLMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ikiru</a>) share screen time with Ozu constant Ryu Chishu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>).  Even the legendary Nakadai Tatsuya (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Portrait-of-Hell/dp/B000CSUNUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Portrait of Hell</a>) joins in as the narrator.  I can't think of any other Japanese film that has this much talent gathered together.

Animeigo's production of ""Japan's Longest Day"" is not as exciting as some of their more recent releases.  Their superb subtitling is still here, but the bonus features are limited to production notes.  Even so, this is a fantastic DVD.",1237420800,16,3289,6.7695961995249405
2604815,5,B000GDIBQG,"Woefully unheralded war classic came five years after our own ""Longest Day"", and matches that film in conveying all the complexities of turning the tide of war; indeed, in this case, bringing it to a deeply humiliating, almost unthinkable conclusion. Japanese soldiers had been indoctrinated to fight to the last man for the glory of the Empire, so surrender is unthinkable to many. The film's power emanates from the slow-burning agony of impending defeat. Mifune is very much front and center as the War Minister who must shoulder the burden of making his troops submit to the Emperor's edict. A fascinating, minutely-detailed film of Mount Fuji-esque proportions.",1182902400,23,666,5.233644859813084
2604816,4,B000GDIBQG,"At Noon on August 14, 1945, Emperor Hirohito took the unprecedented step of ordering his government to accept the Potsdam Declaration and surrender unconditionally to the Allies.  (Although regarded as divine, the emperor was little more than a figurehead, being too exalted to bother with politics.  Though recent historians have shown that Hirohito often worked behind the scenes to influence policy.)  Fearing that the populace might fight on anyway, the government took another unprecedented step and made a recording of Hirohito's voice that would be broadcast to the nation, confirming the surrender.  That broadcast was scheduled for 24 hours later -- hence the title of the movie.  In the meantime, a group of over-zealous officers attempted to stage a coup, capture the emperor and the recording, oust or kill any politicians or generals who stood in their way, and continue the war.  The subsequent events make for a story as tense and surprising as any fictional film.  As far as I can tell, the movie sticks pretty close to the facts.  The only major omission I noticed was that the film leaves out a U.S. air raid that caused a black-out, which in turn helped the emperor's staff hide the recording from the coup's leaders.

""Japan's Longest Day"" is a cross between political thrillers like ""Seven Days in May"" and ""Thirteen Days"" and spot-the-stars WWII epics like ""The Longest Day"" and ""Tora Tora Tora.""  It was designed to celebrate Toho Studio's 35th anniversary, and just about every major male star who worked at Toho in the 1960s makes an appearance.  Most notable are Kurosawa-regulars Toshiro Mifune as war minister, Takashi Shimura as information minister, and Tatsuya Nakadai as narrator, as well as Ozu-favorite Chishu Ryu as prime minister.  Most of the actors are excellent, and anyone who thinks Mifune was a ham should see his subdued but intense performance here.

For western audiences unfamiliar with the events, the movie can be a little confusing.  It helps to see recognizable faces in the major roles, and director Kihachi Okamoto (who was an heir to Kurosawa at Toho) keeps a fast pace by filming in a documentary style.  His approach isn't as kinetic as Kurosawa's, but he injects some stylishness here and there -- like the exaggerated spurts of blood that samurai movies use.  Although I think Okamoto could have cut a few unnecessary characters (like two air force commanders who don't do much) and used more music to increase the tension, the movie is good at revealing the characters' motivations, especially how they rationalized their actions when caught in a paradox:  receiving an imperial order that went against their sense of military honor.

AnimEigo's anamorphic DVD is good but not superlative.  The print looks fine, though as lovers of Japanese films probably know, a 40-year-old Toho film can always benefit from the sort of loving care that only Criterion provides.  It just doesn't glow like the rerelease of ""Seven Samurai,"" and I think the transfer is interlaced, too.  However, AnimEigo obviously cares about the movie, and their subtitling is thorough.  They also include the movie's trailer, a photo gallery, and some liner notes that contextualize the events.  I only wish that the DVD also included some sort of non-fictional documentary.  The History Channel made a superb documentary on this topic, and it could have been a fantastic extra.

If you're a WWII history buff, an afficionado of Japanese cinema, or a fan of real-life political thrillers, then ""Japan's Longest Day"" is well worth your time.  It's an absorbing recreation of an event that too few western audiences know anything about.  And it's a movie that virtually every Japanese person has seen at least once.  (It's shown on Japanese TV every August 15.)",1160784000,68,3788,5.056360708534622
2604838,5,B000GDIBQG,"As a fan of foreign films in general, I am resigned to the inevitable necessary evil of subtitles (still preferable to dubbing). But what I can't stand and will never get used to are subtitles that are either too small, on the screen for too short a time, or infuriatingly white over a white background. There is no excuse for such.

But I have yet to see a movie in any language so artfully and pleasingly subtitled as ""Japan's Longest Day"". Almost no grammatical errors or typos (the only mistake I noticed was a consistent misspelling of ""led"" as ""lead""), and variously colored to indicate multiple speakers - brilliant!

Oh... and by the way - the movie was riveting as well (once the first 20 minutes or so were up). As the film started, I was initially worried that the entire thing was going to be a newsreel-style documentary of historical tableaus. All such concerns vanished however, once the actual plot (pun intended) got underway and we were sucked into the intrigue surrounding an attempted Japanese military coup in the last hours of the Second World War. From then to the last moments of the film, it was impossible to turn away from the superbly acted hyper dramatic events unfolding at lightning speed.

I always knew as a bald fact of history that there had been a last-minute attempt by certain junior officers to stop the Japanese surrender, but (assuming this movie is historically accurate) I had no idea what a close thing the actual events were. What a catastrophe was averted by the failure of the coup plotters!

Well worth the watching. Just be patient during the movie's rather clumsy start - you won't regret it once the real action starts.",1403913600,2,1670,4.708904109589041

A rich and well crafted script is combined with superb directing and some of the best screen acting since sound was introduced into Japanese movies.  Cinematography and film score are extremely good.  There are two choices of subtitle length: full and truncated.  Chose the former (as need be) and just read faster to maximize the dramatic impact.

2604844,5,B000GDIBQG,"As far as I can tell, the drama seems to generally fit the history, as well as i know it; of the final days before surrender by government of the Empire of Japan to the Allies of World War 2. As in any movie, I think some events and the contents of the Emperor's address to the nation are somewhat condensed. However I believe that the spirit of the movie mostly reflects the truths of the time.

The movie is in Japanese with English subtitles. This is a modern historical drama, not a typical war movie. I was impressed at how the movie moved me in better understanding not just the events, but the feelings and values of the people of the time. I particularly enjoyed the acting of Toshir Mifune. He made a very convincing Japanese military chief.

I felt the only weakness of the movie was that the young Army officers who attempted a coup to prevent the surrender seemed somewhat over-played as wild-eyed hot heads. But for all I know that might, or might not be accurate. In any case I believe the director intentionally  set out to portray the the leaders of the attempted coup that way.

From a modern American perspective, I found the movie to be moving and enlightening about the time. I also have some suspicion that the drama intentionally try's to show a slightly sanitized version of history that might try to take away some residual self-guilt about the war and how it ended in Japan.

Any movie that is exciting and makes me think like this is a good movie in my book!",1374019200,5,1484,4.4411764705882355
2604845,1,B000GDIBQG,"I didn't realize prior to purchasing that it was in Japanese with subtitles.  I was. Very disappointed. I don't see very good and to try to read as fast as the Japanese talk, is absolutely unnerving .  That was a wasted $15.  There should be a reminder when purchasing through amazon prime. They should have a warning. ""Subtitles, are you sure you want to purchase"". Before you complete your purchase.",1368144000,,401,4.7
2604846,5,B000GDIBQG,"This movie is basically the Japanese equivalent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downfall/dp/B0009RCPUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downfall</a>. Both films feature the final days of the regime for one of the Axis nations. This film doesn't offer as negative a view of the Imperial Japanese state as Downfall does the Nazi German one, but both films convey the frustration and despair of a proud empire's surrender. They also deal with the madness of people unable to accept reality. The sheer eagerness of so many to commit suicide rather than accept defeat and the delusional belief that future victories could turn the situation around are also common themes. It's fascinating to watch.

Qualitywise this film is superb. It may be from 1967 and in black-and-white but it feels very modern in terms of structure and style. It may be a dialogue-heavy drama but it feels like a fly-on-the-wall documentary more than a stage play. While it is entirely an ensemble drama it does feature some excellent performance, including one from Toshiro Mifune as the minister of war. Another Kurosawa favorite, Takashi Shimura, is in here but he has a fairly minor role. For a drama there is an awful lot of bloodshed including a decapitation and ritual seppuku. They aren't sparing of the blood in either, and while the black and white nature of the film makes it slightly easier to bear the seppuku scene in particular is hard to watch.

The film takes place mostly on the day of Japan's surrender. The big problem for the hardliners is the Emperor's recorded speech over the radio announcing the surrender, which kinda sounds like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-s-Speech/dp/B004X4R49Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King's Speech</a>&nbsp;but isn't. They have to destroy it if they want the war to continue. The first twenty minutes rely too heavily on excessive narration to sum up the weeks before the 14th, but once the film gets going it is very compelling. Towards the end it gets a little bit preachy with the emphasis being that the old ways have ended and the new generation must build Japan back up through dedication and hard work, but it doesn't seem thoroughly innapropriate. There is something far too fascinating about watching a country fall. Japan doesn't have many war dramas, and it certainly doesn't have many that take place on the homefront. That alone makes this film worth seeing.",1362182400,6,2490,5.448186528497409
2604847,5,B000GDIBQG,"This film shows with considerable realism the dramatic events which took place immediately before and during the day of 15 August 1945, when emperor Hiro-Hito announced to the population, that Japan was capitulating.

The action of the film begins on 26 July 1945, when Truman, Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek issued the Potsdam Declaration, a document which stated that only an unconditional surrender"" of Japan will be accepted - it also stated the intentions of allied powers to remove from power those who led Japan into successive agressive wars beginning in 1931, to deprive Japan of all of its armed forces and of all of its colonies, to occupy the integrality of Japanese territory and to judge and punish the war criminals. Allied leaders were also warning in this document, that all those points are not negotiable.

From that moment on an intense and dramatic debate began amongst Japanese leaders, both military and civilian. Most military men as well as a majority of civilian leaders, were against unconditional surrender as long as Japan had any means to fight. At that moment Japan had still millions of soldiers ready to fight. On four main islands there was less than 2 million fully armed and equipped soldiers, with thousands of field guns and many hundreds of tanks. No less than nine thousand planes were ready to be used in kamikaze missions and although the Navy lost almost all of its major warships, hundreds of coastal submarines were being prepared for the battle in coastal waters as well as thousands of Kaiten ""human torpedoes"" and suicide motor boats. It was also the intention of the Japanese government to call to arms the whole population and send everybody, including the women and children, to fight, with any weapon available.

Those who advocated the acceptance of Potsdam Declaration and the capitulation were a minority - until the 6 August, when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima... That changed radically the perception of things by most civilian and even some military leaders and especially by the Emperor himself. With this event the action of the film REALLY begins.

As we all know, Japan ultimately accepted the Potsdam Declaration terms on 15 August and the formal surrender ceremony took place on 2 September 1945 on board of American battleship USS ""Missouri"". But between 6 and 15 August many dramatic events took place before finally Emperor's voice accepting the capitulation was heard by his subjects... This long, but fascinating film describes them faithfully and brilliantly.

In this film you can see most of the greatest Japanese actors from the 60s, including Toshiro Mifune who plays general Anami, the Minister of War and Tatsuya Nakadai, who is the narrator. If you look well, you will recognise amongst the actors quite a lot of familiar faces from some famous movies, including the ""Seven samurai""...

This film is a really great historical reconstruction of a very, very important moment in world history, because if things have happened differently, the great final battle for Japan would have been fought in 1946 and 1947, on islands of Kyushu and Honshu. According to American estimations this fight would cost lifes of no less than half a million of American and around 2 million Japanese soldiers. The estimation of Japanese civilian losses, based on the results of the battle of Okinawa, defied imagination. Considering that Imperial Army had orders to force into suicide or simply kill Japanese civilians on territories which risked to be seized by Americans, it was calculated that no less than 15 million Japanese civilians would be killed, some of them in suicidal charges against American forces but mostly by their own army - many more millions would simply starve, as all means of producing food would be destroyed in fighting and there was not enough food reserves anywhere in the world to feed all the remaining Japanese population. As a matter of fact, the capitulation of Japan prevented the destruction of this country and the genocide of its population.

I was absolutely impressed by this film and I am absolutely keeping it for another viewing - and later for my children. It is not exactly a film to be enjoyed, but it is an important quasi-document, which allows to better understand the final weeks of World War II in Pacific.",1362009600,2,4329,5.004166666666666
