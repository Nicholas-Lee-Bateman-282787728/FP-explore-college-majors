5767008,5,B00D1D46FI,"Start at the beginning and watch them all.  Its a great series where the goal is not to blow away everyone.  Obviously a Canadian series where they aren't cowtowing to the lowest common denominator and telling it more like the first responders actually try for.  Saving lives is the whole point of the job and that is what the series is about and reflects.  If you are looking for explosive shoot 'em ups this is not the show for you, you should probably be looking for something produced for one of the major networks in the US.",1396483200,13,529,4.422680412371134
5767009,5,B00D1D46FI,"I love this TV series and hate the fact that CBS dropped it. This show is nothing but action from beginning to end. If you love police stories, this is for you. Good quality actors, great stories, made  in Canada. Just a great series.",1395273600,19,234,4.318181818181818
5767010,5,B00D1D46FI,"Flashpoint the final season will be in fact season 6.  It's very confusing.  I've been a huge fan of this show and bought the whole set only to find out the the 5th DVD was not the final episodes.  I know because I watched the final episodes on You tube since ION wasn't playing them here.
The titles of the episodes in the final season will be
Broken Peace
No Kind of Life
Run to Me
Eyes In
Sons of the Father
A World of Their Own
Below the Surface
Forget Oblivion
We Take Care of our Own
Lawmen
Fit for Duty
Keep the Peace (Part 1)
Keep The Peace (Part 2) final show.
I hope this helps.
This was an awesome show and I'm so glad to finally have all the dvd's to watch whenever I want.",1394496000,68,685,3.949275362318841
5767011,5,B00D1D46FI,"I LOVE this series... But the Episode listings are so confusing.  This disc APPARENTLY has, what, the last 5 Episodes missing from the Season 5 disc?  NOT TO EVEN TELL US WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS DISC is INEXCUSABLE... as is not having this series available on Blu Ray... when so much junk is.  PLEASE LIST the EPISODES HERE - and let us know if there is a Blu Ray disc set planned... PLEASE!",1393804800,3,392,4.27027027027027
5767012,5,B00D1D46FI,"For those living in the USA these are the final episodes from ION television. After CBS cancelled the show it was picked up in the USA on ION to finish off its run. This was a great show never should have been canceled, but they did end it with style.",1390435200,67,251,4.04
5767013,5,B00D1D46FI,This is Season 5 on Netflix.  We purchased it thinking there was another Season (The Final Season) only to find out it's Season 5 that we just finished.  There's a lot of confusion about this.,1460592000,,192,4.457142857142857

This is, and any of the prior seasons, are good to watch when you're doing long workouts (i.e., the treadmill or a stationery bike).",1433116800,,284,4.320754716981132
5767025,5,B00D1D46FI,"Don't be fooled! There are only 5 seasons of Flashpoint. Those seasons were divided into 6 boxed sets. I was extremely excited when I saw this, because I watched all 5 seasons on Netflix and thought it was picked up for 1 more that wasn't added to Netflix's lineup.  I realized the truth when I compared the episode listing.
Still gets 5 stars because this show is amazing",1431648000,4,372,4.470588235294118

5767033,5,B00D1D46FI,"I just started watching these episodes on Netflix. I love cop shows and I am absolutely amazed at the way these SRU members are trained. I know it is just a tv series, but still it is fun to watch. It is hard pressed to find a action movies without all the foul language and sex scenes. This series as far as I can see is action all the way through each series. I cannot believe CBS would drop such a great show and keep some of the other garbage that is on tv these days.",1422489600,,472,3.9270833333333335

5767041,5,B00D1D46FI,"I can't praise this series enough. I especially like the idea that they tried to save the ""bad"" guys as well as the victims, giving the culprit a chance to redeem himself. The positive interaction between members of the squad was a nice change, since too many police type shows have partners with problems. I enjoyed the final behind the scenes info. The skilled training the actors went through made the show believable. The show held the attention of all ages of family members.",1417996800,,480,4.726190476190476

The stories are so well acted and produced that we have become very fond of the characters and feel concerned for their well-being and interesting personal lives.

5767057,1,B00D1D46FI,"Flashpoint is junk. There is little or no conflict between characters. The characters are all goody-two-shoes who do their job by the book. It reminded me of the crap produced in the 1970's. It bored me to tears.

5767064,5,B00D1D46FI,"Flashpoint is a Canadian series about a Strategic Response Unit (SRU) based in Toronto.  Like a SWAT team everywhere, they respond to all kinds of emergency calls. But the show is not just a crime action drama. The characters are well developed and go through the ups and downs of life. Most of the shows are extremely well wrtiien and some are real tear-jerkers !
I would recommend starting with season One, and you will be hooked by the first few episodes and end up with all the seasons, but it is well worth the price.",1406937600,3,522,4.4375

But now that all the seasons are on DVD (which I now all own), I can watch them and even better still, without any commercials whenever I want. I liked the extras on this DVD too. The final 2-part episode was extremely well-done. Bye Boss, Ed, Spike, Jules and Sam and the rest of the cast. You helped showed the positive side of law enforcement with characters who cared about helping others as well as each other and who were not on a power trip.",1406160000,21,500,4.329787234042553

Taking place in Toronto (a word never mentioned until the last episode), the Strategic Response Unit careened from one emergency to another while keeping their humanity intact.  More than possibly any other police drama, Flashpoint focused on staying true to the job, the team, and yourself.  Great show, great season.",1400889600,13,379,5.283333333333333

I assumed for some reason the Complete Series was made after season 5 and then they had a season 6.  We just got to the end of the Complete Series last night and went to start season 6, only to find that it is actually season 5 on it's own.
