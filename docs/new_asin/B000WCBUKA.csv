8222474,5,B000WCBUKA,"I'd not heard of Lynn Miles until a few weeks ago.  Boy, was I missing out (and if you've not heard of her so are you!).  I first heard ""I'm The Moon"" from her album Unravel, and I was blown away.  I then noticed that ""Live At The Chapel"" was for sale on Itunes as an audio release (apparently it's not been released on CD only on this dvd) and I bought it a few days ago.  She is amazing live.  This live album is listenable from the beginning to the end and is definitely recommended.",1201305600,,486,4.020833333333333
