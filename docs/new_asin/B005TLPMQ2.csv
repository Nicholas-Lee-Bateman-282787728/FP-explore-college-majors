Fantastic for visual learners, making learning enjoyable through visually appealing graphics. This acted as a stimulus to further questions about the solar system and a healthy interest in our universe. The children have started their own book on the solar system and enjoy watching the cosmic stories again and again to collect more and more interesting facts. Learning is definitely more fun with Jack and Holly and we have our fingers and toes crossed that they'll take us on another learning adventure..... soon !",1322352000,,646,5.046728971962617
8486368,5,B005TLPMQ2,"This is ""the wonders of the universe"" for 5 year olds. But instead of Professor Brian Cox we are guided through the enormity of the solar system and beyond by the equally doe-eyed and lovable cartoon characters Jack and Holly. The exact distances and star counts will go over the heads of your youngsters just as it does for us adults but it will leave them with the general scale and wonderment we all feel when contemplating such mysteries as how the moon got there, where the sun goes when it's night-time and is there life on other planets...?
The mix of imaginative stories, creatures and scientific nuggets of information is beautifully put together with captivating animation and a lovely soundtrack. All narrated by our Jack and Holly, who are so cutesy voiced they feel like part of the family (especially by the tenth viewing!) and the alien in the flying saucer is very entertaining. If you've ever been asked a question about the night sky and had to make up a hasty answer then this is for you (and your kids of course!)",1321660800,,1033,4.619565217391305
