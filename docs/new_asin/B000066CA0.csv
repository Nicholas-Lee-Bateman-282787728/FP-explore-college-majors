7962170,5,B000066CA0,a very intelligent and well crafted film.  I liked it.  It kept me on my toes.  I would certainly recommend it.,1386374400,,111,4.190476190476191
7962171,1,B000066CA0,"Crappy dialogue, crappy acting and crappy synopsis.  Poor acting with no semblance of a plot.  Good idea if the acting and dialogue were improved.  Maybe next time they should hire a military adviser to assist with the details.",1358812800,,227,4.921052631578948
7962172,2,B000066CA0,"Sick & Stupid Score:  3/7*

This is hardly a ""psychological thriller"" as the synopsis claims, unless you are an urban dweller and you find the something-is-scary-in-the-woods theme psychologically thrilling.  As for the ""Alpine mountains of Northern Italy,"" forget that, also.  The film was made in Georgia, USA.  But if you have never been to Northern Italy, and maybe have never seen alpine mountains, this film might possibly work for you if you close your eyes during a couple of swampy scenes.

This is an amateur film from start to finish.  Besides brand new combat fatigues, parade ground boots, M-16 rifles with mail order accessories, and other rented quasi-military gear, the ""soldiers"" in this movie are made out of cardboard.  These are not ""soldiers"" by any definition, not even by today's goofy and girly standards.

The bottom line is you cannot make a movie that spends 1 hour and 17 minutes following a handful of boot-camp types walking through the Georgia woods.  Even if you are terrified of walking in the woods, after more than an hour of it, you kind of get over your fear.

What else?  Oh, yes, there is a bogeyman in the woods, and everyone dies one by one.

7962174,1,B000066CA0,"The actors were stiff and seemed to stumble on their simple dialog. The five actors, a ""ghost"" and a shaky cameraman did little to add to the very weak story. Only the ending was worse than this high school performance.",1234396800,2,219,4.5
7962175,2,B000066CA0,When I first saw that this movie starred Michael O'Hare I thought it was the same actor who was on Babylon 5 as Commander Sinclair. However after going to IMDB.com I discovered that the actor in this movie is Michael O'Hare Wallace.,1216857600,3,232,4.5476190476190474
