4228620,5,B003YE450U,"I first saw this series on PBS and have often wanted to see it again. More than any other war documentary, this suite brings forth the awful magnitude of WWII, especially for the Eastern Front. The organization of each segment is designed to bring out every aspect of the key engagements with clarity and power. This includes a critical analysis of political and military strategies as well as the weapons and forces used by each side. The mistakes made by the Nazis and the Allies are told with simplicity and balance. Although the computer animation is from the 90s, it is very effectively combined with combat footage to present a powerful and clear understanding of each engagement. The necessary background conflicts that lead up to each major battle provide a comprehensive view of the war in Europe and Africa. The Pacific War is not extensively covered but the great naval battles of Midway and Leyte Gulf are included in one set. The narration by Tim Piggot Smith is superb and not overly theatrical. I just read ""The Storm of War"" by Andrew Roberts. It makes an excellent compliment to this series.",1312156800,2,1108,4.806282722513089
4228621,3,B003YE450U,Was looking forward to the Bluray format but it is not up to par unfortunately. Nice documentary do not get me wrong but the picture quality is not what you'd expect from a bluray product. I am happy to have it in my War collection,1310083200,9,231,4.155555555555556
4228622,5,B003YE450U,"Having originally recorded this series on VHS back in the mid 1990s I had tried for years to find a copy on DVD.  When I found it a few years back I had to order it from the U.K. and play it on a PAL DVD Player.  Thankfully it has been finally formatted to Region 1 and repackaged in this new series for US viewers.

This is one of the most comprehensive series for fans of military history and it presents these great battles at both a strategic and tactical level.  It is one of the few programs, especially when it was originally produced 15 years ago, that provided simple, yet clear graphics to explain troop levels and deployments to a great level of detail.  Each episode is self contained providing significant coverage of the events preceding the specific battle and if you watch several episodes you will therefore have a fair amount of overlap.

I appreciate the style of the program which uses only narration, music, archive footage (often edited at a quick pace) and graphics. I especially enjoy the episodes which Tim-Piggot Smith narrated. Unlike other programs there are no interviews or sound bites of either renowned figures (like The World at War) or of average soldiers who participated.  The approach can be summed up in a word as ""academic"", a word that would often make me shy away from a program but in this case I think is very true.

I only hope the episodes from later parts of the series will also be converted and available for purchase.",1300147200,12,1466,4.568702290076335
4228623,5,B003YE450U,"The Battle of Midway is just one of three Sea Battles films of this series.
However, Midway is well worth the price of the whole set!

This Naval Battle was complex. I've seen other documentories or Hollywood flicks that glamorize this great sea battle, but ""Battlefield"" organizes the strategies, technical details and geographic information in a most logical way.

As you view it, you're on the edge of your seat. It is quite suspenseful and the outcome is up-in-the-air until the final minutes.  It's very entertaining, and your family and friends will think it was 90 minutes well spent.",1299283200,6,591,4.94949494949495
4228624,4,B003YE450U,"If you're familiar with this series then you probably will purchase this and if you're not familiar; then purchase this with the knowledge that it is one of the best and probably least known TV series covering the United States involvement in World War 2 and Vietnam. According to Wikipedia this series started in 1994 and finished in 2002 after six seasons (series). The series is a comprehensive detailed look into each battle offering rare film footage and yes even color footage along with a single narrator Tim Piggott-Smith. The individual episodes are broken into 2 parts lasting about 58 mins each.

This set contains the following episodes: The Battle Of Midway / The Battle of Leyte Gulf / Battle of the Atlantic. It is about the Battle Of Midway I want to comment on. The major point about the Midway DVD is that there is about 3 minutes of footage missing that they couldn't find. This is interesting because I have an original VHS tape with all footage when I recorded the original showing. There is no mentioning of this on the package are anywhere else. In fact there are two parts; but, here, NBC / Timeless media group decided to air it in one complete package. There are interactive chapter menus which I couldn't locate except buy pressing the next chapter button on my remote. The DVD audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 and the film is in color / black & white and it looks like it was taken care of properly even though there is no remastering involved here.

The program sets you up with an introduction to the events and then with the aid of the film and maps presents a well detailed account of the battle. Midway was a battle victory for the United State which was in a desperate need of some type of victory 6 months after Pearl Harbor. The victory came on the heels of good luck, excellent planning, and all those teams working together. One interesting fact that was brought out is the American ships had radar with an effective range of about 100 - 150 miles while the Japanese ships had no radar. The island of Midway was equipped with a rather old radar but it was a long range radar. Still a good bite of luck was needed to locate the opposing side. Midway couldn't fall into Japanese hands as it was really close to our doorstep after Hawaii. With only 3 aircraft carries and limited support units the United State handily defeated the Japanese Navy by sinking 4 of their top line aircraft carries something Japan never recovered from.

If you have the movie Midway either the edited or complete version (containing the battle of the Coral Sea) you owe it to yourself to have this detailed account of the battle. Any historian / WWII buff would also want to purchase this. Don't let the missing 3 minutes bother you. In fact if NBC wants the footage they are welcome to drop me a note here with instructions as to how to get it to them. This is also coming out on blu-ray next week (December 7) so enjoy this excellent series in either format.",1291248000,35,2968,4.523277467411545
4228625,5,B003YE450U,"This is an outstanding series that I have waited 16 years for since the first Battle, The Battle of France, was shown on TVO in Ontario. It is wonderful to finally have all of the series now on DVD. My old video tapes of the series that I recorded when it first aired are showing their age.

I just wanted to correct the info above. The Battle of Midway is not missing the entire second part. In fact, all that is missing is about 3 minutes & 22 seconds from the start of part 2. I know this because as I said above, I recorded the original series as it was shown on vhs tape. The producers of the video give a good written description of those missing minutes, then pick up part 2 from there to it's conclusion. I was baffled however by the explanation that NBC's Archives were searched but these few minutes could not be found. How can someone loose 3+ minutes of footage from a show? Indeed, it would have made more sense if it was the entire part 2 that had been lost!

So, don't let those 3+ minutes of missing footage stop you from purchasing this outstanding series.

May I also recommend the 2 sets of 3 DVD's each of the Battlefield Vietnam series. Another marvellous addition to any collection on military history, this series covers the events from both sides with the respect that all who fought there deserve!",1290816000,15,1322,4.365853658536586
4228626,2,B003YE450U,"I have loved everyone one of the Battlefield DVDs from this series. The only reason this review is a 2 out of 5 stars is because the second half (the conclusion segement) is missing from Disc One ""The Battle of Midway"". And it wasn't a error mechanically, the group putting this series together could not find the second part in any of the achieves/ This statement appears as I was watching the DVD. (I will then assume the Blu Ray pack is absent this hour as well.) Also, on the packing it has the wrong amount of show time because of the missing hour.
  If you don't mind missing the conclusion of one of the three stories, then buy this dvd. The qualitity is still there, just not all the material.",1289606400,12,701,4.343511450381679
4228627,5,B003YE450U,"This series starts each episode with a high level strategic overview of the significance of the battle, along with the material, man power, weapons systems, and other mitigating factors on each side. Then shows how the battle played out, and concludes with the significance of the outcome for each side. It is not a shoot 'em up tactics series like some, or even propaganda, like the Victory at Sea series. Each episode can stand alone. I only wish PBS had taken better care of this series. Some material is lost, and there can be a blank spot here and there with a page of text indicating what material has been lost. That is sad.",1462233600,,631,4.543859649122807
4228628,5,B003YE450U,"Quickly, the three battles covered in these videos are among the most important of U.S. Naval history. Midway, the Battle of the Atlantic, and Leyte can never be reviewed too often and in too much detail. My only disappointment is that there are not three other battles that might be added in another ""Great -- or almost Great -- American sea battles of WW II"". Those might be Guadalcanal (the naval parts of the victory are underreported and often neglected), the final battles for the Marianas (especially the ""Marianas Turkey Shoot""), and Okinawa (which in addition to the heroics on land was an equally heroic naval battle involving, on the U.S. side, the greatest armada ever assembled in history (and ever likely to be assembled ever). This is not to criticize ""BATTLEFIELD -- Great Sea Battles of WW II"", but only to ask for a further look into the incredible work of the U.S. Navy (and some of our allies) in the ""Pacific"" during World War II. One of the ironies of the storytelling we've added to our histories the past 20 years or so is that the ancient videos of ""Victory at Sea"" are still a good way for a new generation to get a video overview of all that...",1461110400,5,1171,4.5545023696682465
4228629,4,B003YE450U,"I gave 4 stars for the source material, but not the $90 price some dealers are asking.

They run it down, almost like they're teaching a class. They start at the top, giving info on the country/leader, then the commanders and the army they command, they also describe some of the pertinent and important weapons of each side. They go into details that I've not seen anywhere else.

4228640,5,B003YE450U,"Many of the WWII documentaries that I've seen have a narrator, reels of old black and white film footage, and an occasional map thrown in. This documentary is similar, but the way this program is structured makes it far better.

Battlefield - Great Sea Battles of WWII divides a battle into different components. PRELUDE: how and why a battle occurred in a particular place and time. WEAPONS: the types and numbers of ships and planes are described in detail, along with the composition of the various task forces. COMMANDERS: describes the officers in charge of the opposing forces and and gives a little bit of info about their background and psychology. PLAN FOR THE OFFENSE, PLAN FOR THE DEFENSE, etc. There's also a lot of maps showing the moves and counter-moves of the opposing sides.

4228647,5,B003YE450U,"This superb documentary series gives an excellent analysis of major battles and campaigns of World War II. Each battle has a prelude, the battle itself and the aftermath. The Allied and Axis forces of each battle are compared in the categories of Leaders (Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, et al.), Commanders (Nimitz, MacArthur, Yamamoto, et al.) Weapons (F6F Hellcat, A6M Zero, Essex-class aircraft carrier, Yamato-class battleship, etc.) and other categories.
This edition includes ""The Battle of Midway"" (the turning point in the war in the Pacific Theater), ""The Battle of Leyte Gulf"" (the largest naval battle in history) and ""The Battle of the Atlantic"" (this segment is mainly on U-Boats and the Allied anti-submarine warfare effort, although some surface warfare such as the Bismarck, Graf Spee, Taranto, etc. are mentioned).

The Leyte Gulf battle is very interesting for the unusual twists and turns the fight takes.  The japanese were using their last throw of the dice.  If they had succeeded, it would have only prolonged the ultimate defeat.  But its Admiral Halsey's actions that fascinate me the most.  I wish the dvd had probed deeper into his actions, regarding the jap carriers.  I have read many accounts of this action, and it is more complicated than the dvds authors make it sound.

4228662,5,B003YE450U,"I am a fan of the Battlefield series on battles and campaigns of WWII. These documentaries are very professional productions with good analyses of the battles - though some are misnamed rather than misrepresented.

This three-disc set consists of three, 2-hour documentaries on three WWII sea battles: the Battle Of Midway, the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of the Atlantic. Each disc covers one battle/campaign. Each title does a fine job of ""setting the stage"" for the battle, evaluating opposing forces/commanders/weapons, cogently describing the course of the battle and its aftermath. Use of period film footage is excellent.

The first is the Battle of Midway in the Pacific that turned the tide against Japan in a single day and was one of the most decisive naval battles in history, right up there with Trafalgar and Salamis. In this one battle, the Japanese lost four fleet carriers and their best aircrew.

The second is the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese Imperial Navy's last roll of the dice that almost worked. Instead, the last remnants of their once-mighty fleet would never again do battle with the US Navy in the Pacific and would rely on Kamikaze to attack the Us forces in increasing desperate waste of human life.

The third is the Battle of the Atlantic between the U-Boats of Karl Donitz and the allied merchant fleets and escorts. A long campaign lasting for years, the Battle of the Atlantic was finally won by the allies after massive building programs of ships, both military and merchant. In the end, the ""Liberty Ships"" could be built faster than the U-Boats could sink them.

This is not only a collection of excellent documentaries, but the price is a real value and the purchaser essentially gets three DVD's for the price of one. I recommend this set with five stars.",1338163200,3,1809,4.8603896103896105
4228663,4,B003YE450U,"But, like all Anglo-American WWII stuff out there: It ignores the pathetic role Gen. Mac Arthur played in these events. Old "" Dugout Dough "" gets his usual whitewash in this recount of events. Other than that I have no complaints. Well worth what I paid for it.  ...Oscar

POST SCRIPT: MacArthur was known as dugout doug and not dugout dough. BUT dugout Dough seems an appropriate name also seeing as he accepted $ 500,000 from Phillipine Pres. Quezon. Also "" Mac "" awarded himself the Medal of Honor for his cowardly abandonment of his men in the Phillipines. Read here all about it:  http://www.subsowespac.org/books/hopkins-the-pacific-war.shtml

It is surely worth noting that the above referenced book by William Hopkins is written by a man who fought as a Marine in both WWII and the Korean War. He was one of many seriously wounded in Korea and returned to the USA. So Mr. Hopkins is a man worth hearing from about all this.

I just now bought this book by William Hopkins from Amazon. I guess it takes a Marine to tell the truth about Gen. MacArthur in a book. Many WWII veterans of the Phillipine`s campaign have discussed what a miserable coward MacAthur was at this crucial time in American history. A Marine had the guts to publish a book that discusses these events. And yes I am a former Marine.

8409089,4,B003YE450U,I am very impressed by this set.  Have watched many other treatments of these battles but this is the best written and produced I've seen.  Actually contains much more previously unseen footage.  Most complete treatment of both U.S. and Japanese forces strategies and tactics.  I will check others in the series and hope they are nearly as  well done.,1462838400,,351,4.88135593220339
