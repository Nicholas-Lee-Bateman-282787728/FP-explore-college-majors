If you want to see some scenes from ""Miss Marple: They Do it with Mirrors"" (1986), look on the back cover of this film sheath. If this sounds mixes up, imaging the viewer trying to make sense of the pictures.

""Murder at the Vicarage"" starts out with important information scenes and a missing one pound note. As Reverend Leonard Clement (Paul Eddington) passes the hedge hiding Miss Jane Marple (Joan Hickson), he expresses an ill chosen explicative to describe Colonel Lucius Protheroe (Robert Lang).

Yep, there is a murder at the vicarage, which is conveniently located in plain sight of Miss Marple. Everyone has a motive and nobody had opportunity. You and Detective Inspector Slack (David Horovitch) must sort through all the sub plots and confessions to find out what happened.",1501804800,,939,4.790123456790123

7845652,5,6303404847,"This is a quasi perfect murder that turns sour because of completely secondary moralistic considerations that should never have come up in the minds of two criminals. But it is the feminine touch of Miss Marple and Agatha Christie. They cannot admit the viciousness of a woman, at least to that point. It is also the presence of the vicar and his vicarage that makes the tale more moral than it should be. A criminal is far beyond redemption when he or she starts planning and preparing, especially when he or she is not alone in the business. A crime of passion can lead to a guilty conscience, but not a premeditated crime with a plotting accomplice. But once again Miss Marple targets people who are living in at least divided circumstances. The main victim is a colonel who has a daughter from an earlier wife and is re-married to a quite younger woman. He is wealthy for sure but he has a very bad character, if not temper, and that makes him a difficult person to live with in private and public life, which provides him with a lot of enemies.",1296259200,,1049,4.46875

I watched this movie without reading the 1930 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (This novel introduced the world to Miss Marple.  Christie wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mysteries altogether.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

A murder occurs at the vicarage in the small village in which Agatha Christie's heroine super sleuth Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) lives.  Inspector Slack (David Horovitch) is called in to investigate.  Miss Marple helps him solve the murder.

To make this case even more intriguing, not one but two prime suspects confess to this murder.  It seems like they are trying to protect the real murderer.

Who are the people associated with this vicarage?  They are as follows:

(1) Reverend Leonard Clement (Paul Eddington)
(2) Griselde Clement, the reverend's wife (Cheryl Campbell)
(3) Colonel Lucius Protheroe (Robert Lang)
(4) Anne Protheroe, the colonel's wife (Polly Adams)
(5) Lettice Protheroe, the colonel's daughter (Tara MacGowran)
(6) Lawrence Redding who is having an affair with the colonel's wife (James Hazeldine)
(7) Reverend Christopher Hewes (Chris Good)
(8) Mrs. Lestrange, a newcomer to the village (Norma West)
(9) Dr. Haydock (Michael Browning)
(10) Mary Wright, the Clement's maid (Rachel Weaver)
(11) Bill Archer, the maid's boyfriend (Jack Galloway)

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance.  (Hickson was 80 years old in this movie!)  All performances in this movie are good but special mention should go to David Horovitch who does an above job of portraying the inspector.

I found this movie murder mystery especially intriguing since it was a big surprise to me as to who the real murderer was.

Finally, the cinematography of this movie is good.  All costumes are authentic looking.  The background music adds to each scene.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

(1986; 100 min; made for T.V.; British drama; full screen; color)
