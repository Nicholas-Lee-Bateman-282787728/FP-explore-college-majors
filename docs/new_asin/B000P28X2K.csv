2809428,2,B000P28X2K,"They call that HD? Well if so I have seen better. 9 HD-DVD set? Why when they could fit the measly 180 minutes on one or two disks, I think they did it to make it look more impressive than they really are. The unforgivable part for me is how they advertise their website in the bottom right hand corner; look I did not pay this much to have a crappy website link on my TV when I'm trying to relax.  It's not all bad they do have some beautiful scenery however money is better spent on something like Planet Earth much better choice.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-HD-DVD/dp/B000MRAAJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD</a>]",1188000000,9,744,5.469565217391304
2809429,5,B000P28X2K,"I have the one disc of this collection which is a 10 minute abbreviation of each disc, and let me tell you it is the most stunning delivery on hd dvd.  It blows away King Kong, it is so resolute, detailed, sharp, and vivid, colors so striking, closeups of butterflies can see every vein, this is a most for anyone who owns hd dvd to show off your set. I have my preorder with amazon and i can't wait for the entire 9 disc collection.  Bravo t the makers of such an amazing collection.  buy this buy this buy this, excellent stuff",1184630400,4,529,4.166666666666667
2809430,5,B000P28X2K,"Wow, I really loved this collection. I love the concept of the endless looping because the visuals and the music are so relaxing and awesomely beautiful. My new favorite. I have one going all the time now. I can't believe how beautiful nature is in HD.",1179187200,10,252,4.5

8188708,3,B000P28X2K,"Title summarizes this set pretty well.  Each dvd is only 20 minutes...Awfully short considering the prices these things came out at!  Nothing great or spectacular about the photography.  Just pretty ordinary scenes, but beautiful and relaxing to look at.  My copy was open, and the discs loose in the case.  4 had rubs and scratches.  Two did not play without some stuttering (Bali being one - a favorite.)",1357603200,,406,4.897058823529412

8188712,1,B000P28X2K,"These discs are not worth the money.  I returned my copy to Amazon for a refund.  Only 20 minutes of footage on a loop and the picture quality is mediocre at best.  There's no high-def ""pop"" to them at all.  Some scenes look like it was a standard DVD on an upconverting DVD player.  After watching Planet Earth on HD DVD, the ""HD"" landscapes in this collection really disappoint.",1201651200,5,380,4.449275362318841
8188713,1,B000P28X2K,"20 minutes, yes each DVD is only 20 minutes long, so for 9 disc, I kept popping DVD all night, that totally destroy the enjoyment at all. Why not put all of that onto 1 or 2 disc instead?",1199404800,,187,3.8205128205128207
8188714,4,B000P28X2K,"Not a bad selection of HD-DVD material. Each DVD is only 20 minutes however. I guess I didin't see that before buying. My bad.
 Anyway. A nice selection of scenery from around the world. Nice to put on for eye candy when having a few guests and having some conversation. Pleasant background music and nice pictures. That's about all I have to say about this. :)",1198540800,8,361,4.46969696969697
8188715,5,B000P28X2K,I just bought a Sony 46 inch HDTV 1080P with the Toshiba HD-DVD player and an awesome surround sound system. When I put on the Living Landscape HD Collection for the first time I could hardly believe my eyes and ears. My friends in the room watching with me kept asking. How do they do that? It's so clear it looks better than real life.  I must say it took 3 trips by the professional installer to get the surround sound system set up correctly. Complicated set up.  Now the sound is really awesome.  I Love the infinite Loop concept. It really creates great backround visuals for parties. I can leave one environment running as long as I like without any menus popping up demanding attention. It's like traveling to a new country every time I play a different program. Just pop in another disc from the set and walk away. Very user friendly.,1191542400,3,843,4.461038961038961
8188716,5,B000P28X2K,"These HD environments actually allow you to turn your home theatre into amazing and beautiful natural environments.  I also didn't realize the power of surround sound to create an emotional experience until we put in one of these DVD's and had the room come alive with as tropical birds flew from one corner of the room to the other and the hummingbirds made you wonder if you were going to see one whiz past your head!  The discs seem to be designed for dummies like me who can't figure out how to use a remote control.... they just begin to play each of the environments when inserted and then keep playing until you put in a different one.  I especially love the gorgeous butterflies birds and flowers of Costa Rica in HD, and the Rocky mountains programs seems to clear the air in our house.  The Pacific Coast program is like a trip to Big sur, and Hawaii makes us feel like we're on vacation in Mauii.  Great fun!  The photography is exquisite and we now sometime just leave programs on as beautiful nature art in our livingroom to entertain and impress our guests.",1189382400,5,1071,4.494845360824742
