7817115,3,6301930711,"This is a movie for motorcycle and race enthusiasts especially.  Although, anyone who likes action and drama would enjoy it as well. I was impressed with the race footage and the realism of it. The storyline is interesting also. The acting is good but not great. Not a movie for everyone and not a masterpiece, but a solid fun and interesting movie.",1016323200,3,349,4.629032258064516
