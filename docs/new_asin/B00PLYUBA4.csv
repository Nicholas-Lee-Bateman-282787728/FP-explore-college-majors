8688621,1,B00PLYUBA4,"Warning!  If you are an insomniac who doesn't have sleep apnea, this will not help.  In fact, if you are that kind of an insomniac, you're probably better off watching, oh, I don' know, The Exorcist or The Shining.  Those are a little less scary.  Far from telling you much about the actual causes of sleeplessness and how to get sleep, this will just tell you all of the awful things that will happen to you as a result of your sleeplessness.  You will live a horrible, awful life.  As you lay awake at 2 AM, here is more food for thought: your brain is unable to flush out dementia-causing chemicals, so, guess what? You're a Really good candidate for Alzheimer's!  You're more likely to get cancer.  If you didn't have diabetes last night at 8 PM, maybe you'll have it in the morning, because insomnia is one cause of diabetes.  And when you're done ruminating about that, then why not go ahead and ruminate about the cancer you'll get because of insomnia?  And, if you run out of other physiological disasters to contemplate as you lay there, waiting for sleep to come, you can always think about the possibility of falling asleep behind the wheel and kill some unsuspecting family with your car.  Aside from a little bit of info about those lucky souls who have sleep apnea (which, bad news, can kill you without proper treatment, but, good news, has a treatment that can save your life, but, bad news, involves getting used to an incredibly uncomfortable noisy machine strapped across your head all night long), the first, oh, 45 minutes of this film is really, realllly, not helpful. Then they suggest cognitive behavioral therapy, which is marginally helpful. Then they point out that sleep meds don't work. Then they go back to the family wiped out by some insomniac driver. So, hey, if you are an insomniac, this whole documentary is pretty much a horror film.",1429228800,5,1870,4.6534954407294835
