4324617,5,B004C3J5KC,"Simply Outstanding!  I possess over 125 WWII DVD's and I consider this set as the best of my collection. What makes it stand out is the use of seemingly inconsequential details. This helps the viewer to have a more insightful understanding of what the realities of daily life must have been during the extraordinary turmoil that was the second world war. Also, in the past i have not been a fan of colorization but with the advancement of this field, Apocalypse WWII will have the viewer questioning whether the footage was originally shot in color.",1359849600,7,549,4.778947368421052
4324618,5,B004C3J5KC,"It's footage about wworld war 2 that was kept hidden from the public. In my view the military did not want anyone else to know how bad and bloody the war really was,but personnly I can't see why because it likes all the others.",1356825600,5,227,4.181818181818182
4324619,5,B004C3J5KC,"I first saw this a a documentary on SBS (in Australia)by accident and just had to buy it. I can say with absolute confidence this is a must see documentary on WWII. The producers have painstakingly collated miles and miles of war footage and then they have enhanced it by colourising the film. This may sound cheap but it is a fantastic result. It has worked very well to bring to life events such as the invasion of France, The battle of Dunkirk, the battle of Britain, the Russian invasion etc, etc. There is some well know footage as well as never before seen footage from both German and allied men who set to chronical the Second World War.

I have no hesitation in recommending this DVD Documentary.",1329868800,9,705,4.5078125
4324620,5,B004C3J5KC,"Bought as a gift for Husband. He is so into WWII. He hasn't watched it all yet, but loves what he has seen so far. He had been asking for this video since it came out, but I waited until I could get the best bargain on Amazon. We are both very happy! Makes a great addition to anyone's War movie collection.",1315267200,3,307,3.967741935483871

8422726,5,B004C3J5KC,"this dvd covers a lot in world war 2, but most of this dvd is colorvised with some original color that I wished that it was all original color would of been more enjoyable to see .you will have to purchase it to judge for yourselves. I don't regret buying I just don't like colorvised films when there is so much world war 2 color film that could have been used.",1453334400,,362,4.112676056338028
8422727,5,B004C3J5KC,"Excellent production - restoration of footage, colorized, with a quick pace and excellent score.  If anything, the last DVD was a bit too quick, leaving out some key information. However, you won't have to be a historian to be entertained by this compilation.",1452470400,,259,5.023255813953488
