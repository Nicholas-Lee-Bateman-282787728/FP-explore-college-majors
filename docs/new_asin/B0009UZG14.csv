2323523,5,B0009UZG14,We love Caillou and this dvd is a great addition to our collection!,1166572800,2,67,4.230769230769231
2323524,1,B0009UZG14,"I felt my own distress level growing to an intolerable level as the poor little dinosaur realized that he came to Caillou with 'nothing', no family.  I had to turn off the dvd.  I am the proud grandmother of a 19 month old who was adopted at birth through an open adoption, a helpful aunt to a 19 month old nephew who was conceived with donor sperm, and friend to a 19 month old adopted girl who was born in China. In this day and age, when families are created through laboratory technology, surrogate mothers, donated sperm, open adoption, foreign adoption (isn't it wonderful!), I felt that this video's handling of a sensitive topic was intolerable.  The animations and simple stories are just right for a young audience, but the handling of a sensitive topic by a set of puppets was downright distasteful.  p.s. I am assuming that the issue of where the dinosaur came from was resolved in some way, but I couldn't watch to the end.",1163808000,3,936,4.553571428571429
2323525,5,B0009UZG14,"My 4-year old son loves Caillou and these DVD's are his absolute favorites of the Caillou collection.  Great for quiet time for kids, the DVD's seem to really engage them and settle them down. Also have some good lessons in them.  Of course there is some of the classic ""Caillou whining"" but what kid doesn't whine!  I recommend these to anyone with young children.",1163116800,5,365,4.671875

My daughter enjoys this cartoon much more than any other video.

She doesn't particularly care for the puppets - but that is not a big deal - they are only about 30% or the show.  The live action segments are pretty good.  The Caillou parts (cartoons) are very good.

The DVD probably will cost you more but you get two vhs length show in one dvd.",1137715200,11,379,4.054054054054054
2323527,4,B0009UZG14,"After a long hiatus, a new Caillou DVD is out. It's generally up to the standard of the past releases, but doesn't really contain much new or exciting in the way of special features.

The DVD is divided into a section about Caillou and his family and a section about Caillou and animals/pets. Viewers will see Caillou taking pictures with his Dad's old camera, meeting Gilbert for the first time, picking strawberries, visiting a fire station and learning about dogs that have jobs. (To describe a few of the segments.) The puppet segments feature Teddy and Gilbert helping Rexy out when he's upset because he doesn't have a family and then later Teddy and Rexy dressing up as dogs. The normal musical and real-kids segments are also interwoven throughout (for those that like these, and they're easily skipped past if you or your kids don't). Oh, and don't worry about whiny/bratty Caillou --- he's hardly anywhere to be found on here.

The special features are character biographies (normally shown at the end of the TV show), Parents' Information (a few screens to read --- taken from the website), coloring pages (only for those with DVD-ROM) and a color-matching game. The picture and sound quality are great --- the picture is full-screen as normal and there are also close-captions (no subtitles). Also, select the PBSKids logo on the main menu for a cool PBSKids promo spot.",1131235200,27,1382,4.876595744680851
2323548,5,B0009UZG14,My son is a major cailou fan so he loves his gift. Goes perfect with his portable DVD player since we don't always want to watch the shows when he does which is all the time. :),1358121600,,177,3.810810810810811
2323549,5,B0009UZG14,it arrived very quickly and was exactly as described.  i will do business with them again.  great service for your customers.,1355270400,,125,4.904761904761905
2323550,5,B0009UZG14,"I know most people don't like the puppets but I had to write a positive review about them. My 20-month old twins, 7 year old son, 9 year old daughter, and I like the puppets. There is one really funny puppet segment toward the end of this DVD where Rexie and Teddy pretend they're dogs and Gilbert wakes up and says ""Dogs? On my property?"" My twins watch them without losing interest. Compared to other kid's videos, Caillou is the best, most sweetest, family-oriented one I have! We just ordered 3 more this year. My twins and older kids love all the videos, puppets or not.",1292284800,,575,4.433962264150943

2323553,2,B0009UZG14,There are too many puppet segments and other non-Caillou fillers in this DVD set. You will find yourself fast-forwarding every 3-5 minutes. Very annoying.,1251417600,2,154,5.458333333333333

2323555,2,B0009UZG14,"My family loves Caillou, but these DVDs will likely get donated to our local library. There are many cute episodes on these videos, all featuring a younger Caillou and Rosie; unfortunately, interspersed are those annoying puppets that kids seem to hate.  Unless you don't mind having the remote in hand, ready to fast forward, I'd skip these DVDs and opt for the newer puppet-less Caillou videos.",1244678400,,396,5.0

2323557,5,B0009UZG14,I had never heard of Caillou until looking for a Christmas gift for my grandson. In talking to my daughter she said he loved the program on PBS channel. When Silas received his movie he was so excited that he could watch it any time he was allowed. Well I guess he liked the movies so much he didn't want to go to school the next day (HE LOVES SCHOOL)! So the gift was a hit!,1233705600,,375,3.9473684210526314
2323568,5,B0009UZG14,"Caillou is no longer available on our local stations.  We were in trouble when we had only one left recorded.  Its good to have many different to watch.  I also bought two holiday videos and another dvd with other episodes.

Fast arrival.  We were very excited to see these come in!  Its hard to be an adult and watch the same one over and over.....Good to have choices.  Always nice lessons learned from Caillou.",1224201600,,413,4.5

2323570,5,B0009UZG14,The Children I watch (Daycare Provider) have always loved Cailou. Its much better than Spongebob and re-runs of Dora/Diego. Highly recommended!!!,1220140800,,145,5.9523809523809526
2323571,4,B0009UZG14,"I have two little girls ages 2 and 3 and they are addicted to Caillou.  We are used to watching the TV show on PBS, so the puppets in between the segments took a little getting used to.  My little girls watch Caillou over and over.  It's nice there is something that keeps them out of trouble, for at least a little while.  BTW, I don't find Caillou ""Bratty"" at all, and I am a certified educator so I have experiences with children of all ages.",1218672000,,445,4.1395348837209305
2323572,3,B0009UZG14,"This video contains one or two episodes of Caillou, which is fine, but the musical interludes with kids dancing and lip-synching is horrendous! The songs are awful, and the choreography is lousy.

The puppets used to be on the show on PBS, but they aren't anymore. We have another Caillou DVD (The Creative) that is MUCH longer and doesn't have any kids or puppets. I'm not sure how to tell which of the other videos contain them...",1217116800,,432,4.6103896103896105

2323574,3,B0009UZG14,"My 2 year old loves Caillou but this DVD has more clips of kids singing and dancing, puppets, and family time than of Caillou cartoons.

2323575,4,B0009UZG14,My toddler loves caliou so it was a great investment.  He got this as a christmas present and has not stopped watching it since.  The only thing that could be better is if you could buy one disc with many episodes on it.,1200787200,,220,4.093023255813954

2323577,2,B0009UZG14,"My daughter loves Caillou, but has been very upset with this video.  For some reason the producers decided to interweave narrative vignettes with puppets and live action -- my daughter spends the duration of each segment complaining that she wants Caillou, and I spend lots of time with my fingers on the remote.  I wish the producers had identified the DVD content more clearly; we'd have bought something else.

Disappointed overall.",1192060800,16,435,5.098591549295775
