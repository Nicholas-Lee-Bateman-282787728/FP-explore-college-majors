8337395,1,B001R4ZYDQ,we wanted to like this movie - we did like the actors and the movie was well produced - but the movie was just very stupid and vulgar and pretended to be funny which it was not - if you like what appears to be a drug induced sophomoric story that is truly meaningless ok but if you enjoy beautiful French films with a great story pass this one by - we hope to find a much better movie next time - which should be very easy to do,1464912000,,428,3.8202247191011236
8337396,4,B001R4ZYDQ,"Inside the wall of the advertising world, Octave Parango played by Jean Dujardin is failing to cope with the intense, stress, boiling plate temperature that advertisement workers have to put up with on a daily basis.

With million dollar contracts pending, with sex appeal in many ads to attract buyers, with a daily need for creative ideas, Parango is this avant grande, eccentric, off the wall, wacky, droll, movie, yet interesting enough to watch. This is far from a typical movie of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets back girl, this movie is more like calling V V V V V a straight line in the making. Yet Dujardin performs excellently as a ad burn out workers, who knows he is at the whim of the client's opinion.

To add to that he's also at the whim of his girlfriend to treat her with the proper respect. All of the skimpy plotline, visually this movie is a treat. Cartoons are mixed in with real actors with a strong show of technology. Nonetheless, the intense need to succeed in the advertisement takes center stage in this 2007 movie directed by the French Dutch director Jan Kounen.

Personally I like strange, off the wall movies, and I was really close to given 99 Francs five stars, but I fell short, and only gave it four. Reason, this film was made nine years ago, it could be labeled already as pass&eacute;. Yet it could have been made last year, but it wasn't. If it were, then I would have hit the five star button.",1462838400,,1443,4.479087452471483
8337397,3,B001R4ZYDQ,"A sumptious visual feast, this film ultimately sinks beneath its pretense.  There is undoubtably a story to be told in the effect of wanton commercialism.  But this film betrays and almost uniquely French ability to simultaneously profit from and disown Western civilization as we know it.  And while the world's advertising budget could indeed put a huge dent in world hunger, for how long?  And to what end result?  It's certainly possible to live in the modern world without going near the levels of excess shown in the movie.  That's what most people do every day.",1334966400,,568,4.864583333333333

Listed under the comedy category, but that term only very loosely applies to this extremely dark drama.

Filmed as an indictment of the twisted commercialism that inundates our modern lives; a brutally invasive and sicker version of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B000YABIQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>'. Peels back the fetid skin of advertising, mass consumption, and the general disrespect held by marketing companies and global corporations in regards to the human condition.

Not much in the laughs department, so I feel a bit cheated. Still, this was an excellent film when seen in the proper context, but that certainly is not as a comedy.

'99 Francs' tells the story about one of these media manipulators, a cynical megalomaniac whose drug-tainted talent fuels the desire and demand for every service, every product; and in essence, every thought that passes for our own. A man who delivers a mocking slap to the face of every person within his reach; the filmmakers makes the very painful point that we're the sheep and Monsieur Octave Parango (Dujardin) is the self-indulgent pied piper dancing us toward the butcher's blades.

An intense, almost hallucinatory, film that describes the lives of characters who make their living in the world of ""dreams"". Sharply cut intersected scenes play out like a hyper-Nickelodeon; flashes of in-the-moment unexpectedly blended with wild spinoff imaginings that somehow, amazingly, coalesce into a coherent plot. We witness Octave's degenerate lifestyle and the stunning indifference he has towards everyone around him. It's the very definition of narcissism. And it's a personal failing that slowly putrefies his soul and damns anyone foolish enough to orbit his sickness. Sadly, by the time he finally realizes the truth, it's far too late to remedy.

Very reminiscent of another French classic ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Occurrence-at-Owl-Creek-Bridge/dp/B000286RQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</a>"". I don't want to spoil it beyond that, but the similarities between the two productions are obvious and should be noted.

I would categorize this as 'fish-eye-real' in that this is a severely warped version of reality, elements of life that are bent in such a way as to seriously skew our view of what we're observing. It's accurate and true of course, but the rendering is so warped that it takes on a life of its own.

Note: This is a French production with English subtitles. No judgment other than: If that minor inconvenience prevents you from enjoying films - then you'll suffer for it, having chosen to exclude a large gamut of amazing productions and stories.",1315785600,5,2782,5.670673076923077
8337399,5,B001R4ZYDQ,"Maybe a little too frenetic (the center clearly will not hold) and tricked out for its own good (some great use of digital technology sits beside some overused techniques), 99F still comes off as an excellent example of making damning social commentary with largess and humour noir dark enough to fill a few chapters in a Martin Amis novel. Framed as a high-style first-person drive through the utterly vapid land of advertising, 99F juxtaposes awareness with its lack, humanity with its absence, lucidity with opacity.  Featuring an unprincipled principal character who is driven to an act of commercial sabotage due almost solely to the slight of having his inherently lame advertising concept for Madonna Yogurt (from her breast to your lips) made even lamer by his client's own ""tutu concept"", an unsustainable world and worldview become further destabilized. Completely unaware of himself, his actions and the effect his actions have on others, it's often hard to tell which of these hollow men are the most hurtful here -- which, I hope, was the point. Delusion is layered on top of delusion, artifice and artificiality predominate motives, thought and action. The fallen man becomes a literally falling man and only on the way down does he gain some slight glimpse of life outside the monstrous construct he has helped create and perpetuate. Hilariously sad, thematically astute, incredibly well-conceived and acted, manipulative and discomforting -- your laughter functions solely as a bulwark against pain. Ambitious in scope and scale, playing with the postmod aesthetic and buttoning things up nicely, 99F leaves us with just one question: What would Godard do?",1297814400,4,1672,5.2388059701492535
