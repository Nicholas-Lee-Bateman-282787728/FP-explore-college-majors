535553,5,6302969786,"I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING is over 50 years old, and to tell the truth I would not have purchased this film if Criterion had not made a version.  I've taken a chance on some of the older films that have not undergone the Criterion clean-up and regretted it. No matter how good a film was if you can't see it it does not matter. I found this transer excellent.  The sound is not first class, but one cannot make Dolby sound from a single track.
The story is as old as the hills, a young woman (or man) set on marrying a wealthy suitor finds herself falling in love with a less well provided for suitor.  Oh what to choose--love or money.  In the real world, many folks opt for the former and some of them find happiness, and many opt for the latter and end up miserable. Most likely no one can say with any certainty what is best but I vote for love.
Dame Wendy Hiller is wonderful as the headstrong young woman who travels to the rugged west coast of Scotland to meet and marry her fiancee. She and her co-star Roger Livesey both give extraordinary performances. Both were stage players and members of the Royal Shakespeare company, and the movie is more like a stage play than a modern screen play. The documentary on the DVD explains Livesey's shots were done on a sound stage in London as he was starring in a play when the film was made and could not make the journey to Scotland. That he is shown outdoors in Scotland and you probably won't notice the difference, says much about the talents of the cinematographer. When Livesy and Hiller are together the chemistry is grand.
The external black and white shots in Scotland are fabulous.  The documentary that accompanies the film explains how tourists, particularly Americans visit the film sites--the hotel where the anxious young woman is forced to wait out a storm, the red call box next to the burn, and the whirlpool where hapless sailors have lost their lives for centuries.  Seems the tide coming in between two islands creates the whirlpool and the photographs of this marvel including a boat circling round and round are wonderful.
The DVD contains English subtitles so the hearing impaired and/or veterans of the 1940s can review a much beloved film. Those who speak Gaelic or who had ancestors who did so will be thrilled to know there is plenty of local dialog--another reason for the English subtitles. Petula Clark fans will be pleased to see the young Petula play a little rich girl instead of the cockney kids she frequently played.  Some of us remember her as the singer who made ""Downtown"" a top hit song. The film was dedicated to Scotsmen everywhere--including America.",995068800,18,2640,4.580508474576271

535556,5,6302969786,"I had never seen this film before, but, being a fan of Powell and Pressburger, I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed, to say the least.  The film is filled with memorable characters and is set in a wonderful Scottish location.  It is obvious that Powell was in love with the locale.
Criterion continues to manufacture the most truly ""special"" editions available on the market.  The secondary soundtrack is a truly informed commentary on the making of the film.  The special documentary material includes extensive footage from Powell's earlier film ""The Edge of the World"" as well as commentary by Thelma Schoonmaker (Powell's widow), Martin Scorcese, and a woman who was so moved by the film that she journeyed to the location.  Her color photos of the place are included and they are lovely.
The bottom line on this film is that it is a magical, nearly undiscovered gem.",990144000,4,886,4.758169934640523
535557,5,6302969786,"I don't know how aware the general public is that there is an big niche market of women who absolutely adore romantic drama or comedy stories set in Scotland. Although they like present day stories set there, it is the period pieces that they really go bonkers over.  This film is set in WWII Scotland, which now qualifies as history, in the wildest part of it, the Hebrides. Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) travels there to marry a British industrialist, who she has never met, for his money. She is completely unapologetic about her proposed practical marriage of convenience and affluence. What completely throws her for a loop though is being marooned in a village due to the weather, where she meets handsome Scottish laird Torquil (Roger Livesey).  He rents his land to her fiance as a primary means of support.  It is the resolution of this triangle that is the plot of the film.

Hardly earth shattering stuff except that Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were the creative talents behind the film. Their being the top talent in the UK at the time was a reputation well deserved.  They crafted a small gem of a film here with a wonderful village and island offshore, peopled it with offbeat, eccentric characters and customs, and ultimately wrapped a love story around it that even involves an ancient curse and ruined castle of the laird's. I adored this curse and laughed for probably a full ten minutes when I read it.  I thought at first that maybe the film should have been shot in color but then saw a documentary on the DVD showing the place in color and realized that all the atmospheric conditions would have been lost.  An American film maker would not make this film the same way.  This is a very British film.  I would say that if you enjoyed, for example, Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller in ""Pygmalion"", which I did, you would equally enjoy this. If you hate all British films, in general, especially from earlier decades, then this 1947 film might not do a thing to change your mind.  That is my only warning about it.

535558,4,6302969786,"Wendy Hiller knows where she has to go. Straight to the New Hebrides in order to marry one of the wealthiest men of England. The scottish fog and, later, never stopping winds force her to stay at Pamela Brown's House. She will learn during these three days of waiting that life is not as simple as she believed until then.
An ordinary story in an extraordinary landscape. Filmed partly on location on the west coast of Scotland, British directors Michal Powell and Emeric Pressburger's I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING starring Wendy Hiller and Roger Livesey is a valuable addition for your library if you are an admirer of these genial directors or simply looking for a DVD you could watch again and again without having the feeling that it's not worth the price.
The bonus features found on this Criterion DVD are amazing. Among other things, you will learn that Roger Livesey never left London where he was the leading character of a theatrical play and that a double replaced him for the scenes in Scotland ! Even Michal PowelI, some years later, didn't know anymore who was on the screen at peculiar moments, Roger Livesey or his double. Look at these home movies shot by Michal Powell himself in the New Hebrides, rarely the cultural potential of a DVD has been so smartly used.

Some films touch you in a way  that is universal and timeless. This girl-meets-Scottish Laird story is one  of them.  Wendy Hiller is captivating in this post-Pygmalion role.  Saying  too much about it is like talking about a souffle - you miss the essence.  Just buy or rent it.  A sure bet.
Powell was married in later years to  Martin Scorcese's brilliant brilliant film editor, Thelma Schoonmaker.  Her  commentary will likely be insightful.

I KNOW WHERE IM GOING! *****
(1945, UK, 87 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)
After the shooting of any given Archers film Michael Powell used to leave the editing in the hands of Emeric Pressburger and head north! to the Scottish Highlands to clear his head. This no doubt fed directly into both the spirit and the story of I Know Where Im Going!, the film that probably wouldnt have been made if Technicolor stock was available for The Archers to shoot A Matter of Life and Death which was then waiting to be made. The script was written in less than a week and the final result conveys the sense of having been made on vacation, so light and fancy free is its story of rich London socialite Joan (Wendy Hiller) who heads north to the Scottish Isle of Kiloran to marry her rich but elderly future husband, but who gets side-tracked by the twinkling local laird Torquil (Roger Livesey) into a whirlpool of fantasy and love.

As with so many Archers films, reality is derailed by fantasy in a narrative structure made up almost completely of binary opposites. Joan thinks she knows where shes going but actually hasn't got a clue. Logic is opposed to illogic, city to country, England to Scotland, material richness/spiritual poverty to material poverty/spiritual richness, the idle English renters to hardworking Scottish locals, social chequebook marriage to mystical marriage by divine fate. Joans world is delightfully overthrown and turned inside out in a series of wonderful imaginative sequences as the elements conspire to prevent her from ever reaching her destination  the train dream montage with the Scottish hills covered in tartan, the extraordinary cilidh dance sequence (choreographed by Archers regular actor John Laurie), the dramatic storm sequence in which Joan and Torquil do battle with the Corryvreckan whirlpool in a flooded-out boat, and the delirious climax atop the ruins of Moy Castle. Erwin Hilliers cinematography is strikingly assured in its capturing of the elements which exteriorize the inward emotions of our central couple, especially of that wild natural spirit which hides within us all but which is too often buried in nauseating layers of necessary everyday social etiquette. Joan emerges cleansed and revivified for her experience as do we in the audience for this is a film that we feel rather than merely watch. It is about intangible emotion that we like to think we recognize and control, but which lies completely outside our grasp and actually controls us. Like all of us Joan advances through life deluding herself that she is in charge of her own destiny. It is only force of willpower that maintains the illusion, but when that willpower is shattered by external events (in this case by true love mirrored by the wild elements) the confused reality of who she really is blazes to the fore with volcanic force. This makes this film both a continuation of the concerns of A Canterbury Tale (1944) and a foretaste both of life-saving love miraculously found in A Matter of Life and Death and repressed love surfacing with the extraordinary psychosexual fireworks we see in Black Narcissus (1946).

In a further binary opposite people are always saying that The Archers were years ahead of their time, but quite a lot of their freshness comes paradoxically from the retention of old tricks and devices from the silent days. Here I was reminded as much of F. W. Murnaus Sunrise (1927) as anything else. The train montage could have slotted into the city/country montage beginning of that picture and the storm here as there is also shot with the boat lying across the frame up front with special effects raging behind it  the only difference being here the boat is actually rocking! Add the final shot of A Matter of Life and Death which quotes almost exactly the final sequence of Sunrise, not to mention the Max Schreck-like make-up (from Nosferatu [1922]) of Robert Helpmann in The Tales of Hoffman (1951) and we get the impression that The Archers had a bit of a Murnau thing going on there. Powell had of course directed films during the silent era and both Pressburger and art director Alfred Junge were alumni of (and refugees from!) UFA and the golden days of German silent cinema in the 1920s. Together they knew how old tricks from that era would look strikingly modern in films of the present day.

This film has many of the usual Archer personal touches. The jolly credit sequence featuring the childhood of a young girl mirrors the birth of Pressburgers own daughter Angela in 1942 and the parental feelings he must have had. Powells own pair of golden cocker spaniels (who we saw in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and will see again in A Matter of Life and Death) are to be seen in the house Joan visits along with Petula Clark, a precocious girl who will also feature in other Archer films. Powell was apparently irresistible to women and took the occasion of this shoot to romance Pamela Brown who plays the down-to-earth local girl Catriona who smoulders alluringly as poor Joans world is upturned. A curiosity is the fact that Roger Livesey never set foot in Scotland for he was playing on the London stage at the time. Powell utilized a double and later shot close-ups of Liveseys face in the studio which were later skillfully integrated in. The whole film radiates good humour, a splendidly witty script and amiable performances. In many of the sequences the emotions fairly seethe off the screen in a delightful flood of emotional release. My favorite scene is at the cilidh where the puirt  beul Macaphee is performed while Torquil has his prey Joan trapped up his ladder as he sings the lyrics, making them personal as he declares his love in fine romantic tones looking every bit like the golden eagle which has meantime gone astray. I found the film completely irresistable as it gushes forth so compellingly with the unmistakable whiff of bizarre English (or is that Scottish?) eccentricity which is the hallmark of Powell/Pressburger at their best. It may be the slightest film they ever made, but its among the most lovable. Recommended with enthusiasm.",1490054400,,6222,4.8641509433962264

For some reason, we never quite dislike her as a gold-digger.  There is something brave in her determination to claim the quality life that she believes is her due.  And something ridiculous too.  It is finding out how far she is from love that makes the movie what it is, especially as the man who enters the picture, Roger Livsey's character, is so wonderful at winning her.  He intuitively knows that a direct approach will not work and the relationship unfolds as he quietly allows her to come to him.  The subplot involving a friend taming an eagle parallels the idea of how to rein in a creature that is wild and free without breaking its spirit.

536035,5,6302969786,"From the first time I became aware of Wendy Hiller as an actress, in 1979's 'The Elephant Man', and then having seen some of her in earlier films, I've loved her ability to portray solid, stalwart and stubbern women.  I only saw her brilliant performance in 'I Know Where I""m Going' though about 10 years ago, and it has stayed with me ever since!  Powell and Pressburger, of course, are wonderful film-makers, and here is a prime example of their skills as storytellers and painters of images and emotions.  Hiller is perfectly cast as a young English woman with a strong sense of her own place in society and an even stronger will to further her status with a marriage to a British tycoon.  From the opeing scene, we're introduced to Hiller's character and a man we aren't sure of, but soon discover is her father.  She quickly (as is her won't to accomplish everything) informs him of her intent to marry, and over his concerns, sets off in a series of wonderfully and artfully conceived scenes as she travels from London to the far Scottish coastline, where she'll need to ferry to the remote island that holds her husband-to-be, and her future. But nature and the local residents of the achingly beautiful Scottish coastal village block her intentions, and bring her to a greater understanding of her truest desires.  It's a wonderfully different, if not altogether unpredictable love story, set in a land fairly steeped in tradition and a sort of mystical presence.",1435708800,,1471,4.771653543307087

Also, I wanted to see Pamela Brown (Richard III / Beckett) and Finlay Currie (Ben Hur / People Will Talk). Pamela Brown was wonderful in her supporting role, She could communicate more with her knowing gaze than any actress I can recall. Beloved Scottish actor Finlay Currie was good, but his role was too small to satisfy. Roger Livesey was solid as the dashing young naval officer (and not penniless as the synopsis says). Where the movie fails is the way Wendy Hiller was used. Her character is so selfish and twitty that you'll wonder whatever the young lieutenant sees in her. In a casting error, Ms. Hiller appears (to me) fifteen years too old for the role. Finally, her acting just wasn't very convincing (like Vivian Leigh on a bad day). I was disappointed. The Hebrides and ocean scenery is wonderful, but sometimes spoiled by poor rear projection scenes. In spite of the weak story, its worth a watch for the Scottish flavor and the nice taste of Pamela Brown.",1434499200,,1094,4.586734693877551

""It's one of the best movies ever made!"" he said, with a lot of obvious enthusiasm. I don't know if I'd go quite that far, but it is undeniably a tremendous enjoyable film from an age when story was more important than stars or special effects. The story is simple: A strong willed, somewhat spoiled young woman (Wendy Hiller, later to become Dame Wendy) is on her way to Kiloran, a remote Scottish isle, to marry a wealthy, older man who just happens to be her boss. On her way she meets a charming RAF officer on leave, headed the same way- who turns out to be the titled but penniless Laird of Kiloran. Over several days they're both thwarted in their attempts to reach Kiloran by the unpredictable weather, and it gives nothing away to say that a relationship begins to develop between them. Besides the lead characters there are a host of other great characters that make up the local population, and it is the interplay between these characters, and how they enjoy the simple life that has an effect on our heroine and the life she has planned for herself.",1432598400,3,1160,4.425233644859813

536284,5,6302969786,"The film ""I Know Where I'm Going"" is a masterpiece of World War Two era cinema. It's a comedy/drama about a young woman who travels to Scotland for her wedding, only to get sidetracked by weather, bad timing, and a dashing young Scottish lord. It's got the great Wendy Hiller in the title role, along with Roger Livesey, and a strong supporting cast.

One of the great aspects of this package are the extra features. There are so many wonderful special features in this Criterion edition. That includes: a photo audio essay with some shots of the current locations used in the film, as well as a 30 minute documentary about the significance of the film.

Made in the 1940s, there are two incredibly well-crafted sequences in the film that are ahead of their time: one is a dream sequence that shows excellent editing, and the second is a sweeping water sequence when a boat is caught in a whirlpool. They are fantastic. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1381104000,,959,4.635294117647059
536285,5,6302969786,"This charming film may be initially perceived as light romantic entertainment. The plot is certainly simple and ubiquitous among other movies and novels: a woman's intentions to marry her betrothed may be thwarted en route to her wedding - due to an incipient romance with a stranger. And that comprises the synopsis to this work, one that is not too compelling.

However, the seemingly mundane proceedings are enhanced by elements which elevate this ""light entertainment"" to the apogee of cinema achievement. First is the casting of Wendy Hiller, primarily a stage actress who garnered an Academy Award nomination with her second film, ""Pygmalion,"" just several years prior to this production. Her characterization of the protangonist is multi-faceted and encompasses both positive and negative traits: resolute determination and independence, yet also arrogance and materialism. She is a surprisingly sui generis heroine.

In addition is the setting - the Inner Hebrides, specifically the island of Mull. It is depicted as a ravishingly beautiful environment - pounded almost into submission but remaining defiant against the wind and water currents traversing uninterruptedly the width of the Atlantic. Evidently, this atmosphere inspired the impressive cinematography.

Finally, the viewer is confronted by two scenes so atypical of those of other movies: an observance of an anniversary which unfolds as a celebration of song and dance. And a death-defying journey via boat amid fiercely inclement weather.

This synthesis of the exemplary contributions of the cast and crew has resulted in an incomparable visual and aural experience - one that can be seen and heard time and again, as the nuanced acting becomes more revelatory and the dramatic scenes will still impress. And viewing the many special features of this DVD is highly recommended - they are edifying and delightful.",1380240000,5,1886,5.448630136986301

The depth of even the more insignificant characters makes the film something you want to see over and over.  I've shown this film to kids and young adults (elementary school through post-college) and they all loved it.

536288,4,6302969786,"In this understated love story set during the Second World War, storms prevent the passage of a woman who intends to marry for money and position (played by Wendy Hiller) from the island of Mull to remote Kiloran in the Hebrides where her wealthy fiance rents an estate.  Delayed, she meets a Royal Navy lieutenant (Roger Livsey) who is also the island's laird.

When I say the story is ""understated,"" I mean that the attraction felt by the characters becomes apparent only in subtle ways.  As the film unfolds, however, the viewer increasingly understands that the film's directors, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, are exploring love and its feelings, but in a way unlike Hollywood's formulas.

The photography of stormy seaside Scotland is compelling.  In this regard, the film has many of the same moods as Michael Powell's earlier film, ""At the Edge of the World"" (1937).  In addition to the waves, fog, and crags, American viewers will also enjoy the Scottish characters and their burrs.  And there's an interesting short meditation on the economic side of life:  ""They aren't poor, they just haven't any money.""

The body language and facial expressions say more of their mutual attraction than what is actually said, and is credited more to the virtuosity of the two heavyweight (the best) actors.  The dialogs for the scenes after the storm were weak, as though they were in a hurry to get it over with.  The opening scenes were weak; I almost didn't watch the movie because I got bored at the start. The title and the titled song were last minute thought and out of place.  I would rename the movie to ""I Know"", or ""Dream of Love"", or ""True Love"", or ""Island Love Story"".  The music was excellent.

536341,5,6302969786,"This movie blindsided me - as it does a lot of people, I gather. I knew who The Archers were by then - I'd seenThe Red Shoes, of course. But I didn't know anything about Powell and Pressburger, not really, until one night in my early twenties, when I Know Where I'm Going! showed up in the middle of the night on PBS.

There are so many movies, and so many different kinds of movies, about people falling in love. Lord knows I've seen hundreds of them. Why is this one my favorite? Why is it the favorite of so many movie geeks, some of whom take vacations in Scotland to visit filming locations?

On the one hand, the movie's a very midcentury Brit romantic comedy, and all about a modern girl who's dead set on marrying the wealthy industrialist who owns the company she works for. Which no one, even her distant banker father, seems to think is a very good plan. (In the only license given the kind of surreal excess that so permeates, say, The Red Shoes and Tales of Hoffman, Wendy Hiller has a nightmare in which she literally marries the man's chemical company, rather than him.) Joan Webster makes all her train connections and keeps to her itinerary, all the way to the Hebrides, where...gods and fate and magic and life have another schedule for her to keep. She's never going to make it to that island where she's supposed to get married, you know that from the get go.

On the other hand, the movie's a fairy tale, really, about a haughty princess who thinks she's the s*** and puts on airs because she's going to marry the Lord of the Islands, and then she's waylaid by weather (there is, no kidding, a giant, mythic killer whirlpool in this movie that has to be navigated - it lacks a real monster at the center, but that's about it) and all her schemes unravel. And she finds out the pleasant local yoik who's been aiding her is the real Lord of the Islands right around the same time she realizes she loves the True King, and this is going to wreck everything. There is a wild woman/witch character who's...just so great, and a castle with a curse on it for the Lairds of Kiloran that turns out not so much a curse at all, really.

When I say ""fairy tale"" about this movie, I mean that literally, and I don't mean that Powell and Pressburger plop down a bunch of tropes, cleverly or not, onto a modern story, I mean that I Know Where I'm Going! is a modern story in which magic is subtly real, kind of magical realist, actually. When I read One Hundred Years of Solitude a few years after seeing the movie, it felt very similar.

Visually, the movie is so striking, and they make all of these odd choices that you'd think wouldn't work, but they just make the film stronger. You spend a lot of time watching silhouettes speaking Gaelic to each other in front of what seem like the biggest, stormiest skies in the world. This is not generally how you spend minutes and minutes of a romantic comedy. The story keeps diving into new characters' smaller stories, there's this running subplot about a trained eagle being hunted as a villain, but he's really a hero - I Know Where I'm Going! can be a little taxing for friends who like their plots straighter and simpler.

In the US, anyway, I Know Where I'm Going! is one of those movie geek movies, these days. It was actually a very popular film, here and in the UK, in 1945, and ought to be watched more widely, I think. I'm always surprised when women friends who love old movies and old romantic movies in particular have never even heard of it. If An Affair to Remember or All that Heaven Allows can be so well-remembered that people who make movies endlessly reference these movies, even, why is I Know Where I'm Going! so forgottten, relatively?

Anyway, there aren't that many movies I press others to see, will badger them about and bring up, again, when they passed last time. I Know Where I'm Going! Is one of the few. It's a movie that never loses its charm or luster, whose beauty and wisdom seem greater every time I see it again, and a movie about people falling in love I'll be in love with my whole life, I'm pretty sure.

If I really had that ""Which movie would you bring to a desert island?"" option open to me, this is the movie I'd bring. If you never see any other movies in your life, see this one.",1368576000,14,4281,4.3626097867001254

This is a black and white film that takes place in the Scottish Hebrides, in an island that is across another distant island called Kiloran. Joan Webster, from England goes to the Hebrides to marry off to ""one of the wealthiest men in England,"" but Joan is stranded, first because of a fog, and then, because of a storm. She encounters an English soldier ""on leave"" who happens to be the lord of Kiloran. First, there is some attraction. Later, it grows into something more intimate.

In spite of it being black and white, the landscapes and the castles look beautiful. There is the Legend of Coryvrecken, there are people speaking Gaelic, there is a beautiful waterfall, there is a picturesque retired general who trains hawks and is now training an eagle, there is Caitrina and her hunting dogs, a spectacular Gaelic party, and a mysterious curse. The curse at the end of the film is quite a surprising one. The song ""I know where I'm going"" and ""The Brown Maiden"" have stayed in my mind. My favorite scene is when the main characters face the whirlpool of Corryvreckan together. This is a tempestuous event that can only represent Joan's struggle between pursuing her materialistic goals and following her heart. I highly recommend it and I place it among the best romances.",1347062400,3,1370,4.7322175732217575
536379,5,6302969786,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger gave us this wonderful Scottish fantasy and it has lost none of its strength and power since it debuted in 1945. Wendy Hiller plays the headstrong young lady who travels to the Hebrides to marry a rich man but gets stranded by foul weather in a hotel in Mull unable to sail across the water to the little island where her fiance is, and falls in love with the wrong chap.

The photography of this black-and-white classic is just one of the wonderful features to enjoy. The acting is great, the dialogue is witty and the story could warm the cockles of your heart on a blowy, wintry day. The scene where the characters are stuck in a small boat about to be sucked into a whirlpool puts today's ""special effects"" to shame.

536382,4,6302969786,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger scored a bulls eye with this film, 'I Know Where I'm Going'. This film was written and produced in 1947 and holds up well.

Joan Webster, 26, as played by Dame Wendy Hiller is a young woman who had always known where she was going in life. At this time, she is going from London to the Island of Kiloran, in the Hebrides, to marry an elderly, wealthy industrialist. A storm maroons her for a week on the Isle of Mull. Joining her is a naval officer, played by Roger Livesey. For the first time Joan Webster begins to live with her heart as well as her head. Almost all of the film takes place on the rugged Isle of Mull, and the Scottish folk and their customs are shown. The film comes alive with the whining wind and the crashing of angry waves. One of the most fabulous scenes is the Ceilidh (""Kayley""), an ancient Highland song and dance, held in honor of a couple celebrating their sixtieth wedding anniversary. The song is carried on in Gaelic, and gives us the true Scottish spirit.

The film is a romantic version of many stories and films we have read/seen before. But this time we have this wonderfully alluring cast, and the magnificent seaside Scottish isle. An old story that rings true.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 10-14-10

536386,4,6302969786,"I liked this one quite a bit, and its many charms are pleasant enough: the scenery, the light feel, the gentle predictability, the oft-humorous dialogue. I must admit that I did get rather bored after a while, though. As lovely as it all is, that predictability wore a bit when combined with the rather unbelievable bond that Hiller and Livesay form. I never really felt their love for each other bloom, then suddenly boom, they're together, she's dumped her fiancee, and off they go. You know it's bound to happen, but I just didn't feel it much.

I very much felt the Hebrides, though, and that's what makes this film shine: the locale. Criterion has as always produced a fine transfer (with some good extras, especially Powell's home movies, though Nancy Franklin is highlighted rather too much in the little documentary, for no very apparent reason), and the panoramas look starkly classic in b&w. The live shots are so sweeping and vast, however, that they make the studio scenes seem very cheesy, even by 1944 standards. The boat scenes in particular are just hackneyed. It's interesting that everyone seems to quick to overlook the various helpings of schlock here...but it is a light comedy after all, I guess. Still, that stuff, the mostly uninspired music (excepting the bagpipes and the choral singing, of which there's not nearly enough), and the weak attraction between the two leads kind of killed the romance for me.

I'm apparently in the vast minority for thinking this isn't the ultimate romantic comedy. But having a Scottish mother and having spent some time in the western islands, I couldn't help thinking that their charms are over-depicted here, and their windy, treeless, foreboding nature is downplayed to the point where it all seems a lark. Lalala, let's boat around in a gale. Those islands are fun in the sun and summer, but in general they are pretty harsh places, and it was hard for me to forget that and think that going on a boat ride in a storm there would result in romance, instead of certain death.

Coleridge might pop up here and recommend I suspend my disbelief a bit more, and he may be right. But in any romance I want to believe that the love depicted could be real, and here I don't. Nonethless, I Know Where I'm Going is well worth watching for its many charms, and it does have one of my favorite lines in any movie: ""They're not poor, they just don't have any money.""

Any movie with a heart like that has got to be commended.",1267142400,,2475,4.669724770642202
536387,3,6302969786,"I Know Where I'm Going! (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1945)

Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) certainly does know where she's going when she starts out on her trip--to meet her fiance, Sir Robert Bellinger (the voice of Norman Shelley), a chemicals tycoon she plans to marry for his money. Except things don't quite go as planned; thanks to a summer squall, Webster gets marooned on a small Scots island of the kind Ealing were so fond of at the time (viz. Whiskey Galore! four years later). There, she finds her plans going awry; she may actually be developing feelings for Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey). Which will win out, heart or head?

Such is the state of romantic films circa the end of World War II in Britain that, honestly, we couldn't care less. Joan Webster is a thoroughly unlikable character, though as the movie progresses she does go from ""thoroughly unlikable"" to ""I might be able to stand her for five minutes without wanting to throttle her"", and Torquil is, for lack of any other term that can do him justice, a patsy. From the standpoint of plot and character, I Know Where I'm Going! is not one of Powell and Pressburger's better films, not by any means.

But the island. My god, the island. In a world where Australian cinematographers have photographed some of the greatest vistas on the planet, Rodrigo Prieto can make us understand the majesty of the American West with one long pan shot of thousands of sheep on a snowy cliff (that single shot is the best thing about Brokeback Mountain), and cinematographers have even taken us out into space, Erwin Hillier--very early in his career as a cinematographer, mind you (his first cinematography credit was in 1942)--gave us a breathtaking little patch of land. As irredeemably stupid as the main characters may be, as well, the supporting cast is a delight. There's a reason that, fifty years later, everyone still talks about the ceilidh scene (and 80% of the time it has nothing to do with Webster finally realizing that she has feelings for Torquil, whom I admit I keep referring to by his first name because said name is so delightful). It's the best bloody thing in the film, save Hillier's landscapes. He might as well have been a painter. (Note that Hillier's debut was as an assistant cameraman on M; working under Fritz Lang could make anyone a genius, it seems.) I don't think it succeeds as a movie. I never have.

536432,5,6302969786,"This much beloved wartime film from the Archers, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger, has all the elements of film romantic comedies that have long since become clich, but which seem amazingly fresh here. The film constructs Scotland as basically England's romantic and mysterious Other: whereas the middle-class heroine Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) doggedly wishes to imp-rove her station by marrying a chemical corporation (she really wants to marry its owner, but in the film's hilarious dream sequence she marries the corporation itself), she finds herself temporarily marooned before her wedding in the Scottish Hebrides, which the Industrial Revolution has passed by entirely. Soon she starts falling in love with the place (at least as the movie constructs it): its impracticalities (the one concession to modernity, a telephone booth, has been constructed right next to a waterfall), its legends, its ghosts and its customs. Although there's a convenient love interest for her in the person of a dispossessed gentle laird (Roger Livesey), she really falls more in love with the location he inhabits and its people. The Scotland the film constructs is as amusingly fanciful as something out of Sir Walter Scott, but that's Powell's and Pressberger's point: legends of cursed ruined castles are much more attractive to us than the hard facts of chemical corporations.

The film becomes genuinely exciting when the heroine and hero are trapped in the great whirlpool Corryvrecken off the Scottish coast, especially since the maelstrom is clearly meant to mirror the condition of her heart. Wendy Hiller was an unusual choice to play Joan, given that she neither looks 25 nor does she seem beautiful enough to bewitch a chemical magnate, but given that most of Joan's character is fleshed out indirectly by her circumstances it probably was necessary to cast someone as subtle and commanding an actress as she is or the character might have seem underwritten; and she is well matched by the easygoing but always engaging Roger Livesey.

Far lesser known and filmed in a vivid palette of just black and white and shades in between, this lush 1945 romance carries the fresh visual inventiveness (thanks mainly to Erwin Hillier's expert camerawork) and rich dramatic texture of their later works. Written by Pressburger in less than a week, the rather slight story centers on headstrong Joan Webster, a middle-class Englishwoman with a clear-eyed ambition to marry Sir Robert Bellinger, a much older, wealthy industrialist, on the fictional Isle of Kiloran in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.

The film's title refers to her singular determination to get to the remote island, but a gale prevents her taking a boat to Kiloran. Forced to stay put on the Isle of Mull, Joan gets to know a small community whose inhabitants hold values that are quite foreign to her. There she meets Torquil MacNeil, a strapping naval officer trying to go home for some shore leave. It turns out that he is the laird of Kiloran who has leased his island to Bellinger. Gradually, Joan gets immersed into the local populace, especially feeling drawn to MacNeil, but her innate restlessness leads to a hazardous act.

Her multi-faceted turn as Joan is a strong reminder of her talent. Roger Livesey is a solid match for Hiller as MacNeil, and you can't tell that all his scenes were filmed in London since he was appearing in a West End play at the time. Pamela Brown makes a vivid impression as dog-loving Catriona Potts, a free spirit who owns the lodge in which Joan stays.

The 2001 Criterion Collection DVD is a classy packaging of this old chestnut. It begins with a thoughtful commentary track by film historian Ian Christie. The centerpiece is a 1994 retrospective documentary, ""I Know Where I'm Going! Revisited"", which follows New York writer Nancy Franklin's journey to visit the actual locations of the film a half-century later. Surviving locals are interviewed, as is 1960's pop songstress Petula Clark, who played a precocious, twelve-year-old girl in one scene. This disc also houses some of Michael Powell's home movies, which were taken during his treks through Scotland and here, Powell's widow Thelma Schoonmaker, Martin Scorsese's favorite film editor, narrates over the visuals. A final extra is an excerpt from Powell's early documentary, ""The Edge of the World"", about the inhabitants of a similar island faced with the prospect of being relocated away from their home roots.",1210291200,7,3579,6.043307086614173

But it wasn't until last night that I got a chance to view this one. It's a perplexing puzzle, wrapped in an enigma and shrouded in mystery, as to why this wonderful movie is not (1) better known, and (2) recognized as a certified work of genius. Where have I been all these years? I'm crazy about Scotland--I've bicycled through the highlands and isles--I have Scottish blood in my veins, yet I hadn't really heard much about this film.
I won't attempt to give a plot summary--others have done that admirably here--but I will heartily and enthusiastically recommend this magnificent work of cinematic art. First and foremost it's a romance, and so that might dissuade all you ""macho men"" from venturing in. But do your wives and girlfriends a favor and take the time to catch this one. There are so many rewarding things about it: visually, you have the absolutely stunning beauty of the wild and windy Western Isles, the craggy peaks and ruined castles, the savage seas, the barren and windswept shores, the mists that creep in off the water.
The b/w cinematography--please don't let that dissuade you from seeing it, just because it's not in color--is simply incredible; it must have taken some real guts and determination to go out and film in those conditions. The always artificial-looking technique of back projection is briefly used during an ill-advised attempt to cross a rough stretch of the sea to the isle of Killairn, but that is a forgiveable sin, since it would have been impossible in those days to even keep a small boat like that afloat during such rough weather, let alone do filming with a circa-1940's camera.
I mustn't forget the delightful and beautiful Wendy Hiller, with those wonderful cheekbones and that insouciant manner; she is as zesty and as mercurial as the Scottish weather itself.
The soundtrack is a treasure. There is a ceilidh (pronounced ""kay-lee"") scene where there is dancing and music from three Scots pipers, as well as beautiful singing. Don't miss the bewitching title song which we hear when the young girl is on the train to Scotland.
Martin Scorsese appears on the extras, saying basically the same thing as me: he saw the movie years after it had been out and couldn't believe he'd missed it.",1205366400,11,2369,4.83743842364532
536437,5,6302969786,"From the late 1930's through the early 1960's the British cinema was best known for its quirky comedies and historical dramas (ala David Lean's films) before British realism took over.  Perhaps other than Lean the finest representatives of the genre were the films of the directing/writing/producing team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.  Their masterpiece was undoubtedly ""I Know Where I'm Going.""  It is essentially a romantic travelogue starring a young, radiant Dame Wendy Hiller as the spunky (actually too spunky) heroine and Roger Livesey, a dashing naval officer, as her romantic foil.  But the real stars are the breathtaking vistas of the Western Isles of Scotland, the eccentric locals (including a brief scene stealing appearance by a 12-year old Petula Clark), and the screenplay which combines all these elements (along with an ancient curse!) seamlessly.  When people say they just don't make movies like that anymore they are referencing films such as this one; or as stated by Martin Scorsese ""I reached the point of thinking there were no more masterpieces to discover, until I saw 'I Know Where I'm Going'!""

As usual the Criterion Collection DVD has a wonderful set of bells and whistles including an equally quirky retrospective documentary, some home movies by Powell, and a revisit to the film's locations.

Finally I defy anyone except the most unnostalgic cynic to watch this film and not ending up singing or humming the title song.",1199923200,5,1467,5.1645569620253164
536438,5,6302969786,"Here's a film I would have never ventured to watch had I not come across it by accident on Turner Classic Movies.

This woman, Joan Webster, played by Wendy Hiller, is off to Scotland to marry some guy she obviously doesn't know too well. We know this ourselves because she has dinner with her father the night before she's scheduled to leave for the Hebrides. Her father tries to tell her to slow down and think about it but she: ""KNOWS WHERE SHE'S GOING."" (She doesn't scream it, as implied by the caps. But she might as well have. The setup is movie perfection.)

Joan has these directions to the island on which this guy has planned to marry her. She has to take the train from London to East Bumshoe, then another train from Bumshoe to Overloafen, a bus from Overloafen to Pudgydubby, a cab from Pudgyduddy to Shaddycrack, the ferry from there to some other weirdly named town, then the water taxi to yet another Scottish backwater, and finally a private skiff to the island.

Unfortunately, when she gets there, it's thick of fog. Swirling, smoky, impenetrable fog. Fog like you won't believe, unless you live in Scotland or Great Britain or Maine, like I do. Or you own a Hollywood fog machine, or work in a Russian spa, or live next door to Sherlock Holmes. You get the point.

So she can't get to the island. She has to stay at someone's house with a bunch of other people who are similarly stuck. At this point, we're only about five minutes into the film, which is just more of this movie's magic, because it's here she's dealt the classic ""Call to Adventure"" of the hero's journey. She meets a man, and not the one she's supposed to marry.

The man is Torquil Macneil, played by Roger Livesey; he wears a kilt and speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue, and although he's not exactly the most handsome leading man you ever saw, he does wear a kilt and speak in a heavy Scottish brogue, which makes him, apparently, very hot. Don't get me wrong, he's always the perfect gentleman. It's 1945 for God's sake.

Later that day, feeling rather threatened by this charming kilt-wearing Scotsman, she tries once again to get the boat to the island. She's told it's way to foggy but as soon as the wind comes around northwest, the fog will lift and they'll be able to go. That night, Joan, while lying in her bed at the Inn, prays for wind from the northwest.

In the morning Joan wakes to find her prayers answered. The fog has cleared. Unfortunately, it's because of a full blown northwest gale, which ends up sticking around for more than a week. She never makes it to the island.

This special gem of a movie is the product of one of the most creative collaborations in movie history, that of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.

They had a gift for storytelling that is almost gone. Very often when you see a film today you're struck by inconsistencies, failures of logic, plot holes, gimmicks, etc. Or you're faced with a movie that just doesn't come together. Not the case with Powell and Pressburger films. Their movies have perfect structure; they engage you, keep moving toward a goal and wrap up all neat and tidy.

If you ever see this one on the video rental shelf, grab it and take it home. I guarantee you won't be disappointed, especially if you're trying to score some points in the romance game.

536479,4,6302969786,"""I Know where I'm Going"" is one of that handful of old films which transcend criticism (e.g ""the Ghost and Mrs Muir""). A simple story of a materialistic girl who opts for love not money, the film is a mood piece set in romantic and evocative settings among the islands of Scotland. It does not matter that Wendy Hiller is an oddly unfeminine heroine, cleverly toned down with the use of a ocelot hat with hand bag to match, who booms her dialogue as if in a theatre, that the soundtrack is hard to hear at times especially in the crowd scenes and that the special effects used for the whirlpool scene have not withstood the test of time - the sum total is memorable. Roger Livesey is a stalwart and romantic hero with a ""whisky and soda"" voice which may have been his greatest attribute.

This is an expensive Criterion package so you expect the extras to be good. Ian Christie provides a commentary which carefully explains, among other things, what Hiller's character represented as the war drew to a close when the film was made. This is invaluable. He is able to explain the class implications of Pamela Brown's character, the impoverished and resourceful gentry, and this helps validate such an outrageous character to the modern audience. He also refers to Sir Walter Scott and the Scottish heritage of myth and magic. This is a great commentary.

Also included is a 1994 documentary about the film with appearances by Petula Clark, who played a small part in the film, and Dame Wendy Hiller herself, a woman who had matured into a handsome elderly lady in the same way Jessica Tandy and Barbara Stanwyck did. Other extras include excerpts from home footage by the director Michael Powell, narrated by his widow and a section of his 1937 film ""The Edge of the World"".  These illustrate Powell's love affair with Scotland and if you feel the same way about the place, you will enjoy them. Certainly, the sum total is convincing because the reality is that this is an endlessly bleak and rugged part of the world so Powell's vision is very personal.

The film would make an interesting double feature with ""Local Hero"" which has not dissimilar themes and evokes a similar warm response from its audience.",1195516800,4,2208,4.68298969072165

536482,4,6302969786,"Except to one or two outright dismissals, the previous 44 Amazon reviews consist pretty much of raves.

Let me be a contrarian and point out a few things that are less than stellar about this film.

--The opening credits are cutesy enough to send some people into sugar shock.

--The soundtrack is a disgrace.  Enrico Caruso warbling into large metal cones in 1905 was captured in higher fidelity than anything on this Criterion edition.  If the problem was in the original, Powell and Pressburger were using disgracefully sub-standard technology even for wartime Britain.  If the problem is with Criterion, then that outfit should have lived up to its prestigious reputation by either seeking out a better source or using the sort of technology that is routinely used to reveal remarkable fidelity in opera recordings made more than 80 years ago.

--The musical score has been flattened to match the blandest English taste.  This is particularly apparent in the folk song that gives the movie its title.  The piece is sung at a dirge-like pace by a young girl of little talent who has obviously been told to make it as sweet sounding as possible.  The effect is something like Guy Lombardo playing ""Satisfaction.""  An actual Scottish choral group appears briefly in the big party scene.  For about five bars they are given a chance to let us know what decently trained voices singing at tempo can do with the music of the islands.  It is a pleasing but too brief respite.

--There is a sub-plot, or rather a diversion involving a country twit of the huntin' and shootin' type and his hunting eagle.  This is so pointless that I suspect that Powell and Pressburger simply stumbled over a man at the shooting location who happened to have an eagle, so they wrote a part for the bird to display the landscape.

--The central drama of a woman torn between two courses and two men is never established because the man Hiller's character has come to marry never appears.  He is heard only as a pompous voice on a radio receiver.  Hiller's dramatic conflict must simply be taken on faith.

--The acting style is pure London West End stage stand-and-deliver.  Roger Livesey's acting technique consists of standing up very straight, remembering all his lines and delivering them in a relentless, affectless monotone.  (How much better the film would have been with an actor such as Robert Donat, who could actually act and offer a convincing Scottish accent, too!)  Wendy Hiller, more often than not demonstrates exactly how it was that she could be heard in the most distant seat in any theater.

--The Hebridean scenery and weather are offered as things of romance and grandeur.  And I suppose they are, if you live in London or Nebraska.  I, on the other hand, live in a part of the world where the scenery is quite similar, except that the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska have mountains that are a LOT taller, the weather can be much worse, and we have trees.  I happen to agree with Dr. Johnson and Boswell who famously visited the very sites shown in the movie during the 18th Century.  They regarded them as cold, wet and gloomy.

That said, I must now declare my nitpicking to be beside the point.  For all its many faults ""I Know Where I'm Going"" works.  I don't for a moment believe in Wendy Hiller's character but I still care for her.  Livesey is an absolute stick, but he's a curiously likeable stick.  I want to see them form a bond.  The gloomy scenery is more than the sum of its parts.  There is magic here, that inexpressible but unmistakable something that makes watching a film two hours well spent.  Down at the level of basic truth and underlying quality, all those uncritical rave reviews were perfectly right.

This is a film well worth watching.

ONE ADDITIONAL TRIFLING POINT: From time to time previous reviewers have referred to this as a film from 1947.  One of the additional features involves an interview with the woman who drove Wendy Hiller to the shooting sites every morning in the dark pre-dawn hours.  The trip down the narrow road was more than a little frightening because she could not turn on her headlights in the wartime blackout.  In point of fact, the film was shot in 1944 and released in December 1945, something that is specifically stated in the supporting material.",1170979200,15,4314,4.72289156626506
536483,5,6302969786,"This is the Powell - Pressburger duo at their finest, a mystical and romantic film unlike anything being produced by Hollywood at the same time.  Wendy Hiller gives the performance of her film career (and that's saying something) as the enchanting heroine who trades mercenary good fortune for true love.  While that observation sounds trite, there is nothing trite or even ordinary about this deeply leveled accomplishment.  The stirring setting is a coastal village where the vicious weather prevents Hiller from traversing the sea to an island where her intended lives.  During that time she lives and grows as the very ""human"" being she already is, and falls in love for the real thing.  Hiller communicates the complexities of this character on so many levels it's astonishing, and the development of her romantic entanglements are enchanting.

This Criterion Collection transfer is absolute perfection, and it makes this very old film seem brand new (in content and visuals).  As usual, Criterion outdoes itself in the presentation of this classic and the extras offered.  Magnificent.",1168992000,5,1091,5.265895953757226

This is a ""Chick Flick"" that the entire family can enjoy. Of course the plot is an old one(girl wants to marry a old rich man but eventually fall in love with a younger man) but it is superbly done. Unlike the TV version, the DVD has much additional information about the making of the film, a story in itself. Needless to say, my wife also loved this movie(and she does not always agree with me).",1168300800,3,539,4.0
536485,4,6302969786,"It's been awhile since I've focused on viewing the work of a particular filmmaker, primarily because I tend to like individual movies over a director's entire oeuvre. I've never had a favorite director, or one whose output I've consistently enjoyed. Russ Meyer comes close, but mostly due to his love of bountiful beauties (though I enjoy his style as well).

Peeping Tom was the first film I saw by Michael Powell and it's since become one of my favorites. I wasn't really aware until recently that Michael Powell collaborated on a number of artistically significant films with Emmeric Presburger in the 40s. Based upon my fondness for Peeping Tom, I have taken to exploring the films by the Powell-Pressburger team (known as ""The Archers""). A Canterbury Tale was the first, and I found its ethereal charm very refreshing. Basically a film about appreciating the everyday, simple pleasures of life, A Canterbury Tale gives credence to the need for roots and tradition. Perhaps a little on the conservative side, it still entertains with its quirky, easygoing style. I liked it as much as the much darker Peeping Tom, though for different reasons.

I Know Where I'm Going! is the second Powell-Pressburger film I've seen, and though it does have a similar appeal, it lacks the dreamy quality of A Canterbury Tale. Part of the problem, I think, is that the story is the typical woman-marrying-for-the-wrong-reason-who-finds-true-love-in-the-end set up. A Canterbury Tale isn't quite so straightforward, and therefore flows much differently. When I already know the direction the story is headed I'm much more conscious of the fact that I'm watching a movie. I Know Where I'm Going! uses the same approach of A Canterbury Tale, introducing eccentric charaters and portraying the virtue of the simple life, and this is the most enjoyable aspect of the film. While A Canterbury Tale takes place in a small English town, I Know Where I'm Going's story unfolds in Scotland. Naturally, much of the screen time is spent on the culture and local color.

The main character in I Know Where I'm Going! is a headstrong English woman (with harsh eyebrows) who travels to Scotland in order to marry the wealthy businessman that awaits her on the island of Kilarny. Her attempts to reach the island are repeatedly thwarted by unfavorable weather conditions, so she spends her time hanging out with a Scottish Naval officer who is on leave. Of course, it's not hard to guess how the story concludes. What makes I Know Where I'm Going! worthwhile, though, is not the story, but the style of the film and the interactions of the characters. The main character really isn't that likable, but everyone around her is.

I Know Where I'm Going! is a romance, but that aspect of the film is secondary to the atmosphere, in my opinion. When the woman finally gets together with the Naval officer, I wasn't really all that impressed. It was everything that lead up to that moment that I liked. If the romance was a little more convincing, I would have rated the movie higher. As it is, I Know Where I'm Going! isn't as interesting or moving as A Canterbury Tale. It's a good movie, but not all that special, at least compared to A Canterbury Tale.

The title song is pretty annoying, but I keep singing it to myself for some reason.",1166832000,,3306,4.84424778761062
536486,5,6302969786,"It's one of the great romantic movies of the celebrated English duo, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, who both wrote and directed it.  ""I Know Where I'm Going,"" was released in 1947; but it's just not as well known as their ""Red Shoes,"" or ""Stairway to Paradise.""

This film stars the young, charm-to-burn Wendy Hiller, as Joan Webster, middle class young Englishwoman who knows exactly where she's going: to the island of Killoran (mythical) off the island of Mull, in the Scottish Hebrides: to marry Sir Robert Bellinger, her immensely wealthy boss.  However, the weather need not cooperate with her.  Storms keep her stuck on Mull long enough to meet and fall in love with Torquil McNeil, laird of the vicinity ( it's his island and house that Bellinger has rented.) Mc Neil, played by Roger Livesey (erstwhile Colonel Blimp) is a modest fellow, but pretty handy with the Gaelic poetry when it counts.  The island  of Mull is enlivened by some sturdy supporting players: Pamela Brown, Finlay Currie, the young singer Petula Clark as a girl in glasses. Finally, Hiller begins to panic as the rain seems to be melting her plans, and her resolve.  She insists on being ferried out to the further island, risking her own life, and the lives of the laird and a young couple, as well.  But the weather will not allow her to leave Mull and it's ultimately too late.

The movie was filmed in black and white, and it's as beautifully shot as any Powell and Pressburger ever made. Scotland's sometimes harsh landscapes look dreamy in the mists; Hiller's train trip across the United Kingdom is a textbook example of flavorful economy. The special effects boys do wonders with the tools then at hand to create the fierce ocean whirlpool described in the local ""legend of Corryvrecka.""  The film's probably a bit sentimental in its portrayals of the happy villagers singing and dancing, and probably accurate in its portrayal of a society still not far removed from the feudal: those villagers sure do tug their forelocks when the laird hoves into view.  Its musical score, featuring that ancient Scottish song of the title, is quite lovely.

Sounds simple but this movie is so rich in characters, settings (you can really feel the storm blowing and sea air).  And what more can you want than Wendy Hiller and Roger Livesey?

Plus that wicked old Scottish tune which will haunt you forever!  I read the lyrics an earlier poster had written and tears came to my eyes.  Such is the power of that song (and the movie).

536548,5,6302969786,"Wendy Hiller plays Joan Webster, a rather chilly, upwardly mobile Englishwoman whose dad is a bank manager.  Even he seems a bit alarmed by his daughter's mercenary soul; there doesn't seem to be much there there, and he accuses her early on, in a marvelously modernistic nightclub setting, of acting more sophisticated than she really is.  He's spot on, for as the movie progresses we learn that (though not WHY, which is interesting in and of itself) she has gradually over time built up a facade in which she actually believes, that money is more important than love.  The thrust of the plot, and of Powell's dizzyingly vertiginous direction, is to disorient her into smashing the mirror and seeing the pieces of her real self, even if some of them are unpleasant.

I don't know which scenes Hiller is better at! -- Being cold, or warming up.  Both kinds do her ample justice and I imagine the part of Joan was actually written with her in mind, just as Powell and Pressburger must have created Catriona for Pamela Brown alone.  Brown, with her cascading weirs of wild red hair and her stranded, fey gaze, strides through the movie as though she owns it, shotgun over one shoulder, savage dogs at heel; but she knows when to stop.  Brown's later scenes are all banked fire.  She knows that Torquil has fallen for Joan and with that simple act he's effectively taken the hope out of her life, and yet she carries on.  It's heartbreaking, or would be except that the movie makers aren't interested in breaking your heart.  What they're after is something more difficult and abstract.

And yet they use preposterously romantic ways of making you think about it!  The legend of the whirlpool, with three kinds of ropes that break in three different ways; the old fashioned device of keeping the ""Ralph Bellamy"" character off of the stage; the disguise of the Laird (Roger Livesay) so that Joan doesn't know he's secretly a nobleman until after she's known him for a bit; the Highland setting, the three pipers, the postponed wedding, the white gown flung into the sea almost like a sacrifice, the twenty pound difference between a life for the two young ingenus and their being separated for years, even Petula Clark, miles from ""Downtown,"" in the absurd oversized spectacles of Alfalfa.  The movie throws everything at us, we either start ducking or we start accepting it all, like St Sebastian his arrows.  For Michael Powell, cinema is a devotional experience; you get what you come for, only you don't know what it's going to be when you pay the price of the ticket.",1124668800,13,2569,4.7309417040358746

536551,5,6302969786,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were Great Britain's supreme exoticists.  What is remarkable is that their exoticism was not relegated to those parts of the globe usually associated with the remoteness and alien.  BLACK NARCISSUS was, in this way, the exception rather than the norm.  More often, they managed to find exoticism far closer to home, such as in the magic of THE RED SHOES, the unexpected intersection of heaven and earth in A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, or even in the life of a relatively average Englishman in THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP.  Thus, it is not at all surprising that Powell (who had a lifelong love of the Scottish Isles) and Pressburger managed to find a remarkably exotic locale within the British Isles, specifically in the Scottish Isles, primarily on the Isle of Mull, in the film I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING (1945).  Although they had already achieved considerable success in other films, this film kicks off the greatest creative period of their partnership, after this one making such masterpieces as A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (1946), BLACK NARCISSUS (1947), and THE RED SHOES (1948).

I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING really isn't like any other film one can see.  The setting is incredibly unique.  Watching the film, it is a bit unnerving to realize there is such an unknown and relatively unvisited area so exceedingly near the rest of Europe.  The landscape shots are extraordinarily beautiful and capture a wild and untamed region, despite the human habitation.  Much of the joy of the film lies in living cinematically for an hour or two in a place that seems almost magical it is so unique.  And indeed, there is magic, even if it is only the kind that movies provide.  The irony of the title lies in the fact that our heroine, Wendy Hiller, believes she knows where she is going, but the islands and the sea prove themselves to be forces of nature to be respected:  they will not always humble themselves to human planning.

The film is driven not merely by a great locale and first rate direction, but a marvelous cast.  There are simply not enough films featuring either Roger Livesey or the young Wendy Hiller (she did, thankfully, make far more films later in life, so stage actors often do, film being less stressful on the body than acting on stage-witness actors like Laurence Olivier and Ian McKellan, who turned more and more to film after the age of sixty).  Livesey is always a delight, with his soft yet rough voice, and his rabbit-toothed grin.  Wendy Hiller did shockingly little film work early in her acting career, but what she did was superb.  She enjoyed great success in two film adaptations of George Bernard Shaw, PYGMALION and MAJOR BARBARA, before this film, and she did nothing else until after turning forty (at which point her film career mushroomed).  Pamela Brown, who enjoyed a long relationship with Michael Powell and whose career was hampered by near-crippling arthritis, is memorable as Catriona.  Much of the rest of the cast consists of locals, though an amazingly young Petula Clark does appear in one scene.

The great irony of a film set in the Scottish Isles is, as is famously known, star Roger Livesey was appearing in a play in London, and was unable to do any location shots.  All of his scenes that required dialog were shot in London, and for all his outdoor scenes in Scotland, a double who looked like Livesey from behind was used instead.  If one hasn't seen the movie, this sounds bizarre, but it actually works exceptionally well.  It actually provides the prescient viewer with a fun game, spotting the shots on the quay, for instance, that were shot partly in London and partly in Scotland.

This is a very special film.  It is on the list of my one hundred favorite films, and I think it will be for many others as well.  The DVD contains a host of wonderful features, as in any Criterion production.  Indeed, DVDs don't come much better than this.",1093305600,23,3945,4.711370262390671
536552,5,6302969786,"What are the truly great, classic romances on film ? Many would think of ""Casablanca"", and justifiably so. However, in its own charming, subtle way, ""I Know Where I'm Going"" deserves a high place on any such list. My wife and I decided to watch this as our ""Valentine's Day"" movie--a perfect choice.
I suppose the big question is--why is a movie that is so predictable, so great ? As usual, the answer is a combination of fine ingredients--script, direction, setting and performances, both lead and support.
Dame Wendy Hiller stars as a bright, independent and arrogant young woman who ""knows where she is going"". Actually, she is ""going"" to a remote island off the west coast of Scotland to marry a much older, but incredibly wealthy man. There is never any suggestion of a relationship between these two people or that they love one another. It is presented to us as an ""arranged"" marriage, just as this fellow ( we never actually see him on screen ) would set up one of his business deals. Of course, fate intervenes.
Several days of bad weather prevent our heroine from leaving the coastal village to meet her intended on the island. During this time, she meets a naval officer who also happens to be the local laird, played by Roger Livesey. Even though he is attracted to Ms. Hiller, the Livesey character does not try to ""sweep her off her feet""--he simply opens her eyes to the charms and rewards of a simple life where ""people are not poor--they just don't have any money"". Before long, she develops feelings for this man, which makes her even more anxious to reach the island and her husband-to-be, so that she can keep her word and ""do the right thing"". Of course, you can't fight fate--can you ?
There are various subplots involving an ancient Scottish curse, a terrifying encounter with a whirlpool, and relationships involving some of the local people. Although shot in black and white, the beauty of Scotland is definitely one of the ""stars"" of this film. While Hiller and Livesey are superb in the leading roles, they receive fine support from Pamela Brown and a group of Scottish actors, including Finlay Currie. Actually, were there any films involving Scotland from the 30s to 60s which did not have Finlay Currie in the cast ? He is like the patron saint of Scottish movie actors !
Criterion, as usual, gives us a beautiful image, and some nice extras to go with this Powell/Pressburger classic. When Martin Scorcese is asked if he would ""remake"" the film, he basically says no--why mess around with perfection ? Thank you, Mr. Scorcese--a man of taste, as well as talent !
This is a movie where you can just curl up with your partner, relax ( except for that whirlpool ! )and enjoy some unforgettable characters who learn what is really important in life. A wonderful DVD to own. Now--when is the next flight to Scotland ?",1076889600,148,2843,4.676646706586826

That's how I was introduced to ""I Know Where I'm Going"", and I was not disappointed.
The plot is thin, but appealing. It's the gorgeous scenery, even in black and white, that makes this movie a standout-it was filmed on location in Scotland. And being a dog-lover, the scenes that include beautiful Scottish Deerhounds are particularly special to me.  Wendy Hiller is terrific as the headstrong young lady bound and determined to marry a very rich older man and Roger Livesey perfect as the low-key local laird with lots of breeding, but little money.

536555,4,6302969786,"A typically wry, enchantingly off-beat and spiritually inclined Michael Powell-Emric Pressberger film, which extols the mystery and unpredictability of life, and the love of human foibles and natural splendor.  Wendy Hiller stars as a young, ambitious ""new Briton,"" an unabashed goldigger eager to make the most of the modern life and her rapid upward mobility.  She's off to a remote island in the Scottish Hebrides, where she's scheduled to wed a extremely wealthy (but rather boorish) English Lord, and thus cap off her ambitious rise into the upper class.  Of course, she doesn't know it, but fate has planned otherwise.  When she arrives at the nearby island of Mull (a real place, with real features that were incorporated into the the plot of the film) she is  halted by the North coast's uncontrollable weather, and while she's stuck on Mull, finds herself charmed by the earthy locals.  In particular, she is smitten by young Torqvill, the laird of a decrepit local castle (Roger Lifesey), who lives life with gusto, despite being heir to a fallen fortune.  The city-slicker whose priggishness is called into question by kooky, loveable locals is, of course, a story that has been done many times both before and since this film was made (""Englishman Who Went Up A Hill..."" etc...)  But somehow, this Michael Powell outing has long been a cult favorite, as seen in several bonus featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD version.  The DVD makes the most of its ""extras,"" with several excellent featurettes, including a short BBC documentary about the making of the film, in which ""New Yorker"" editor Nancy Franklin, smitten by the film, journeys to the island of Mull to recapture some of the grandeur and mystery she felt in the movie. Powell's widow, famed film editor Thelma Schoonmaker Powell, also narrates a couple of segments, gently illuminating Powell's artistic vision and love of nature, as she looks through his home movies and still from the production of the film.  (Micheal Powell fans simply have to see these parts...)  Cast notes: Livesey grows on you, but Wendy Hiller is unlikeable throughout -- the one real trouble with this film.  And look for young Petula Clark, as the precocious daughter of an aristocratic family that hosts Hiller during her stay on Mull.  An interesting film that captures a certian something about postwar Britain, with beautiful cinematography and a stunning look at a real-life boat-swallowing whirlpool.

536596,5,6302969786,"In ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" stubborn Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) embarks on a long journey north to marry the wealthy Sir Robert Bellinger on the Scottish island of Kiloran in the Heberdies.  However, the fates and the Scottish weather work against her plans and teach here the folly of the title sentiment and the song that goes with it.  Originally deterred from reaching the island by fog, Joan encounters naval Lieutenant Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey) who talks her into spending the night at the house of his friend, Catriona Potts (Pamela Brown).  The next day the fog is gone but a fierce gale has taken its place.  Joan and Torquil move to the Tobermory Hotel to better wait out the gale but not before passing Castle Moy where we learn of a curse that forbids any of the Lairds of Kiloran from entering the place.  Torquil, it turns out, is the one of the Lairds but is forced to rent the island to Bellinger just to pay the bills.  At this point we know exactly where this movie is going, even if it takes Joan and Torquil a bit longer to figure things out.
There are two things that make this a most enjoyable romance.  First, the fact that Hiller and Livsey are considerably more real in looks and actions than the actors we usually find staring in such films.  When Joan and Torquil have their big fight about her trying to cross over to Kiloran by boat, they are of course talking about everything except how they feel about each other.  It is such a mature conversation, for lack of a better word at the moment, and reflective of the entire film's approach to the idea of love and romance.  Second, there is a real sense of Scotland in ""I Know Where I'm Going!"", both in terms of the stunning location shots but also the large supporting cast of characters.  This film does for Scotland what ""The Quiet Man"" did for Ireland, although that comparison immediately brings strong feelings of regret that this film is not in color.  Still, it is no wonder that fans of this film make a pilgrimage to the Isle of Mull.

This Criterion Collection edition of ""I Know Where I'm Going"" provides all of the insights we have come to expect.  There are still photographs and home movies shot by Michael Powell with commentary from his widow, as well as a documentary on the making of the film.  The most astounding revelation is that leading man Roger Livesey never went to Scotland for filming because he was in a West End play at the time.  Every shot you see of Torquil out and about is a double and the fact that the interior of Castle Moy was a studio interior is rather stunning given how little film time it is given (albeit the payoff for the entire film).  Ironically, James Mason was originally cast in the role but turned it down because he was going to have to ""live rough"" on the islands of northern Scotland.  Actually, this is a somewhat atypical Criterion Collection in that it caters more to the ""ordinary"" fan of the film rather than the usual student of cinema.
Personal Note: Seeing Pamela Brown in this film was a special treat because she was the actress who originated the role of Jennet Jourdemayne in Christopher Fry's wonderful verse play ""The Lady's Not for Burning.""  I have seen Brown in a few other film roles, such as ""Richard III"" and ""Cleopatra,"" but this is the first time I got a sense of the actress as she would have been in that play and I fully understand the comment that the actress had eyes you can drown in.  Along similar lines, keep an eye out for young Petula Clark as Cheril (the little girl wearing glasses who looks up from her book to ask Joan about her impending marriage).",1044835200,6,3629,4.486322188449848
536597,5,6302969786,"It is difficult to resist the spell of the Archers (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger) at full throttle. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING is one of their greatest collaborations.
It is on the surface a slight story about a headstrong English lass (a young but formidable Wendy Hiller)who travels to the Outer Hebrides to marry a wealthy older man. On the way, she is constantly interrupted and subverted in her aim, not only by local weather conditions but also by dashing local laird Roger Livesey who does not reveal his real identity. (Livesey's rich friuty voice and imposing screen presence enlivened several of the Archers' 40s films most notably in the title role in THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP and as the doctor who sacrifices his own life to argue David Niven's case in the heavenly trials of A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH).
These interruptions and digressions provide a magnificent springboard for the Archers' eloquent, lyrical celebration of the mystery and wildness of isolated British landscapes and more especially seascapes. Like so many of their best films it exerts a powerfully exotic appeal-much of it was shot on location on the island of Mull. The film makers intensely explore the milieu in terms of storms and mists, whirlpools, ancient curses, ruined castles, a strong sense of the supernatural and a wonderfully detailed ruby wedding and ceilidh, Scottish style. In other words, the aesthetic terrain of the heart. As with A CANTERBURY TALE, which is full of the mysteries of the Kentish countryside and of Chaucer's Britain, the Archers create a mystical experience out of regional nature and custom.
Typically also the erotic element is foregrounded; you only have to look into Pamela Brown's wistful gaze and contemplate her long, lush tresses to relize the awakening the Archers have in mind for the naive Wendy Hiller character. It has little to do with her original plans.",1038700800,16,1903,4.987421383647798
536598,5,6302969786,"Although perhaps not as famous as some of the other movies crafted by the unstoppable team of Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell (such as the legendary Red Shoes, or the frighteningly beautiful Black Narcissus) this movie certainly ranks as one of, if not their absolute best. The Red Shoes was sent into the statosphere by it's haunting score, gorgeous cinematography, and pefect special effects. Black Narcissus by it's awe-inspiring use of light and color, and pefect characterization. But this movie is made great by the same thing that endears us to Capra and Kurosawa. This movie is about people. Ordinary people. And the things people do to survive, and pursue what they feel to be their chance at true happiness. But life doesn't always turn out the way you think, and real happiness may not lie where you once thought it does. Anyone who takes movies seriously must see this movie. Any fan of Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell must buy this movie. I know I love it. It's also my sister's favorite movie.

While to younger audiences the plot may appear contrived, it's actually the quite believable story of a woman with a strong determination to marry for money, even to the point of placing herself in danger because of a stubborn streak.  The gentle, wry, and equally stubborn Scots who persistently impede her progress for her own good are scene stealers, every one.  The legend of a cursed castle adds a touch of other-worldly mist brushing against daily lives.

536602,5,6302969786,"This very fine romance tells the story of Joan Webster, a determined young woman at the tail end of WWII, who has always known where
she's going, which is mainly getting ahead.  At the moment, she's on her way to the island of Kiloran, off the coast of Western Scotland, to
marry Sir Robert Bellinger.  Sir Robert has amassed a considerable fortune during the war via his Consolidated Chemical company.  He makes
sure that Joan travels in style, according to a precise schedule, with folks waiting on her every step of the way, right up until the time comes for
her to take a boat over to the isle.  At that point, nature intervenes, in the form of gale force winds, and she's prevented from joining Sir Robert
for several days.
Meanwhile, she meets the colorful inhabitants of the little town, among them the handsome and dashing Torquil MacNeil, a Naval Lieutenant,
who it turns out is the real Laird of Kiloran, forced to rent out the family estate for several years at a time to get the money to maintain it the
rest of the time.  The entirely predictable complications follow, but where a modern film would rely on slapstick and broad humor, Pressburger
and Powell are more subtle.  The film is humorous, but the filmmakers are more intent on exploiting the natural beauty and wildness of their
setting than in getting cheap laughs and they cleverly tap in to several mythological themes.  There is a castle with a curse on it and a
treacherous whirlpool lies between the town and the isle.  In the end, legend and convention combine to bring the story to its necessarily
romantic conclusion.
I have to admit, I normally loathe these stories where one betrothed, or the other, or both, break off an engagement because they've found ""true
love.""  (I guess at the time it was also considered daring to implicitly criticize war profiteering by having Joan choose the poor sailor over the
industrialist.)  But the movie's so enchanting and the use of myth so effective that I eventually surrendered to it.  Powell and Pressburger made
many great films and this one, though I'd not rank it with their very best, is delightful.  Highly recommended for husbands who owe their wives
a chick flick.

I find it hard to believe that a purported intelligent woman who is a gold digger with a father fantasy would think it was a  reasonable to get on a rickety boat in the middle of a horrendous storm and risk her death and the deaths of others so that she could resist her attraction to a poor man (Livesey) in order to marry the rich old guy on an island on the other side of the storm.

A young lady (Windy Hiller) pretty much knows what she wants in life. On her way to her wedding on a remote Scottish island she is delayed long enough to experience a different way of life and a reality that she was never exposed to. Here she finds different values and the difference between real nobility and the early version of plastic money. She is overwhelmed by her new discovery and the man (Roger Livesey) who introduced her to it. Now she must desperately escape or be lost forever in this different world.

I was surprised to find that a young girl in the movie was Petula Clark.

There are advantages to having a movie with a story that is not based on a book. You can enjoy the story for what it is and not have to compare. However this may make a good play. In the Criterion extras you will find speculation on the pro's and con's of remaking the movie.

This film is impressive on its own but the Criterion treatment adds many fascinating dimensions that make you have to re-watch the film just to se the parts that you missed while paying attention though the plotline and scenery.

There is a commentary track that covers the entire film. A behind the scenes stills that even has a commentary. Home movies add to the information about the designers of the story and producers. There is a section from ""The edge of the World."" A great insight and a different way off looking at the story are found in ""I Know Where I'm Going! Revisited"" a 30 minute making of. The location photo essay allows you to see if the color is what you imagined (maybe better).",1506038400,3,1624,4.3966666666666665
