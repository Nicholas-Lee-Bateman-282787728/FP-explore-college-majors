2836928,4,B000QFAFO0,"I've traveled several times to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.  It was fun to watch the DVD and be able to say ""I've been there!"" and ""Oh wow!  Remember that?""  My main criticism:  some of the featured hotels were way more expensive than necessary.  When I travel to Europe I like to stay in 'Gasthofs', smaller family-owned inns that offer quaint rooms, usually with private baths.  Breakfast is always included and usually features soft or hard-boiled eggs, various breads and 'broetchen' (the crunchy rolls), a variety of cheeses and jams, and sometimes sliced meats.

Overall, a great dvd.",1209945600,2,596,5.082474226804123
2836929,5,B000QFAFO0,"If you find Samantha cute and charming, you will love seeing her show you Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.  I do!",1203292800,9,115,4.75
2836930,5,B000QFAFO0,The lady in this DVD makes you laugh. This is great for traveling to Bavaria and the surrounding areas.,1201478400,,103,4.473684210526316
2836931,4,B000QFAFO0,"I'm not much of a traveler but the three German speaking countries are the only countries (with the exception of Ireland) that I am determined to visit someday. This DVD reinforced my view that Germany, Switzerland, and Austria are among the most physically and culturally beautiful places on earth. The natural landscapes are absolutely breathtaking, and the small village settings that seem to be so prominent have always seemed idyllic to me. This DVD is a collection of episodes from the TV show, which features three episodes for each of the three countries:

Germany- Bavaria, Berlin, Munich
Austria- Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna
Switzerland- Interlaken, St. Moritz, Zurich

The show is hosted by Samantha Brown. She can be slightly annoying at times-picture an excessively bubbly, suburban American soccer mom-but she does a relatively good job at playing tour guide, and she's not bad to look at either. She takes the viewer throughout the chosen destinations, talks to locals, and highlights local attractions. She takes us to restaurants, cafes, hotels, resorts, hot spots, landmarks, public transportation venues, and the occasional oddity like a royal ball in Vienna. We learn the prices for comparitive venues, the best times of year to visit, local customs, etc. The whole thing seems a bit superficial at times, but if you can get past that, it's not a bad DVD. All in all, I would consider this a good warm up for anyone preparing to travel to these countries for the first time, or just an enjoyable viewing if the German-speaking countries interest you at all.",1199059200,7,1577,5.108527131782946
2836932,1,B000QFAFO0,"I was searching for a serious exploration of the country.  This dvd spends most of the time focused on the host making stupid jokes and acting quite obnoxious.  She has no grace, and resembles a male host vs. a female.  She dresses herself up nice and then acts without any class.  She might as well have gotten drunk on the show and started belching.  I was embarrassed for her.  The locals must have thought she was just crude.  If she took one moment to notice the people around her, she would have seen that the women are not loud-mouth, gesticulating people.  She appears to be trying way to hard to be funny.  Better to seach the VHS selection.

2836933,5,B000QFAFO0,"I enjoyed this travel DVD, and certainly would recommend it to anyone wishing to travel to Europe, to see things and go to places off the tourist route.  Her Americanism is not annoying, and you do get a laugh at some of her comments.  She mingles with the locals in all regions, takes you to enjoyable places to eat and drink, and talks about the accommodation and gives prices.  She choses the middle to upper types of accommodation in each region, as she travelled in the low season.
I can understand why she was awarded the Emmy for 'Outstanding Lifestyle Directing"".",1193443200,7,571,4.633663366336633
2836934,5,B000QFAFO0,"Oh, these shows make me long to hop on an airplane and travel, travel. TRAVEL.  All the beautiful food in these shows makes me so hungry.  I love Sam.  She is so adorable and sexy and I love the way that she dresses and I am so glad she is not the usual bimbo that hosts shows.
I watched her show on Germany right before I went to Germany/Belguim/Holland last year and it was so cool to actually experience things that I had seen on her show firsthand.  Sam!  You are a BABE!",1187827200,6,475,4.064516129032258
2836935,3,B000QFAFO0,"I didn't think it had enough travel tips.  She tends to stay in expensive hotels and not worry about a budget.  It was nice to get a view of the places, but not helpful if you are trying to find ways to plan a trip.",1333584000,,215,3.7555555555555555
2836936,4,B000QFAFO0,"I love Samantha because she gives a great glimpse into Europe. Someday I will go to all these places, but in the meantime, I enjoy watching.",1318118400,,140,4.423076923076923
2836937,5,B000QFAFO0,"Everyone knows Samantha Brown is a bit corny and not everyone's cup of tea. But it's worth bypassing that notion to rent this. 3 hours of beautiful landscapes, towns, history, hotels, museums, crafts, etc. There are 3 very different cities explored in each country, so it gives you a very broad concept of each place. She did a good enough job that my perception of Germany changed 360, from no urge to visit it to really wanting to go, even with changes I cannot imagine since 2005. What you can count on is that the old cities like Bavaria and Innsbruck have changed little in centuries, with its old architecture beautifully upkept, so are you transported to ""fairy-tale towns"" as she puts it. Another reviewer mentioned using her tips when traveling there and said she was dead-on. That is a statement that speaks for itself.",1313712000,,829,4.724137931034483
2836938,5,B000QFAFO0,"I'm going on a trip to Europe in June and this DVD was very helpful.  It helped me to decide which cities I would like to visit.  If you like Samantha Brown, this is a great buy.",1295481600,,178,3.7837837837837838
2836939,5,B000QFAFO0,"Samantha Brown is an amazing Host on this show. Never boring and always giving great detail on all the places she goes. Watvhing this show is what inspired me to go to Europe in 2008 and Iam glad I had seen the show because it showed me many things I would have missed out on. This DVD has Germany, Austria and Switzerland. All three are amazing. The Switzerland is a definite must see, one of my favorites. Hopefully they'll release full seasons one day but this is perfect for now. They show about two 25 min episode per country so you'll se multiple cities, not just one. The best travel show period.",1272412800,,603,4.392857142857143
2836940,2,B000QFAFO0,"On this DVD, Samantha Brown offers a great itinerary of the Austria & Germany which she visits during the winter but is not nearly as in depth as Rick Steves' or Rudy Maxa! Her bad jokes that are funny 1/10 times really kill the flow of the show as well. Samantha caters to the soccer moms of America but is more concerned about staying in a fancy hotel and getting a fancy dinner than actually learning about her surroundings. She spends way too much time talking up her hotel & eating rather than showing us more sites or offering any kind of history or background of the area. Just like getting half a meal at a restaurant and wondering what happened, Samantha Brown's programs seem way too short and leave the viewer longing for more information, creating more unanswered questions. For a more thorough series watch ""Best of Europe by Rudy Maxa"" or ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009"".",1265587200,,899,4.625
2836941,4,B000QFAFO0,"This show is more lighthearted than Rick Steves or Rudy Maxa. Samantha Brown is just a normal girl having fun. She is not an intellectual, and I think that is the whole point.

The only problem I had with the DVD is that the bitrate is somewhat low. If you watch this on a standard definition TV you probably won't notice, but if you watch on your computer (which has superior screen) you will notice the lower quality video.

FYI you can get all 80 episodes of RICK STEVES EUROPE for only about 63 bucks here at Amazon, which is ridiculously cheap. I recommend getting that FIRST, then maybe getting this. You will learn a LOT more from Rick Steves and Rudy Maxa.",1239840000,23,664,4.390243902439025
2836942,2,B000QFAFO0,"I bought this DVD because I have been to Vienna and Salzburg, and miss them like crazy.  I couldn't wait to see the Vienna episode, but I couldn't believe that it ended without ever giving the viewer half an idea of what Vienna is like!  She spends WAY to much time on one topic (like Waltzing lessons) when she could mention some of the other stuff in the city.  If you are a budget traveler (or a student like me) this DVD will give you an idea of everything you will NOT be able to afford in Vienna.  She skipped all the art musuems, the wineries, the opera, the GORGEOUS architecture around the city, the Nachmarkt... everything I was anxious to see some footage of!  Instead she awkwardly complains about eating a meal with lungs and heart.  If you haven't been to Vienna, these details may not be as important, because you won't know what you're missing out on.  But if you're buying a travel DVD because you miss Europe and this is the more economical choice than a plane ticket back to Vienna, than skip this DVD.",1230163200,12,1021,4.398936170212766
2836943,5,B000QFAFO0,"I have seen several travel shows, but this is the best one. it is iteresting, informative ans usefull. Thanks Samantha",1219363200,,118,4.95
2836944,4,B000QFAFO0,"Let me start off by saying that I definitely prefer Samantha Brown over Rick Steves... she's more charming and current which makes her travel videos more interesting. I think this DVD is great...there are 9 different 20 minute segments from which to choose (3 Germany, 3 Switzerland, 3 Austria), the cities are scenic and the activities are fun to watch. Her German pronunciation is a little off, but it's not atypical for an American. The only reason this DVD didn't receive the full 5 stars is because I'm a MS & HS German teacher and some of the scenes about Oktoberfest and Munich have a big emphasis on beer so unfortunately I have to skip over those in the school environment, otherwise for an adult/mature audience, it's a keeper (and for a great price!)",1210896000,,761,4.686567164179104
8195950,3,B000QFAFO0,"I find Samantha Brown to be annoying and pretentious. It's clear that she is not appealing to serious travelers or geography geeks. Her target audience is the middle age soccer mom types. This is a halfway decent DVD but it would've been so much better if she tried a little harder.

The Zurich episode was arguably the best of the DVD. She visited a chocolate shop and a farmer's market. She enjoyed a cup of hot cocoa at the Caf Schober, which is a bakery and a coffee shop. She used a tram to get around. Samantha encouraged people to purchase a Zurich card which is good for 72 hours of unlimited travel as well as free admission to the city's museums. She later visited the Lindenhof Park, which is the highest point in the city. There, she met some local kids who were in the Swiss version of the girl scouts (and they spoke fluent English). That night, she went to a club with some attractive Swiss women. The episode concluded with her visiting the Uetliberg Ski Resort.

The Vienna episode was also pretty good. She visited an ornate Baroque palace where she enjoyed a performance by Vienna Boy's Choir. She then headed to the Innerstadt, which is the downtown area. Samantha purchased the Vienna Pass. Like the Zurich Pass, it is good for 3 days of unlimited travel. It also provides discounts in museums. One pet peeve is that she usually visits cities in the fall and winter. It is depressing to see an empty city where the trees have no leaves. I can understand visiting Zurich in the winter, but why visit Vienna in the winter? She did the same thing with Paris? The Tuileries was empty and melancholy. Another complaint is that she has a proclivity for staying at the most expensive hotel. In the Zurich episode, she stayed at the Widder Hotel, which is $440 a night. In the Vienna hotel, she stayed at the Hotel Alstadt which is $300 a night. Why can't she just stay at a Holiday Inn?

Anyway, back to Vienna. She visited the Schonbrunn Palace where Mozart once performed. She also visited a Spanish horse riding school. She took waltz lessons at the Elmayer Dance School (they spoke English). At the Imperial Hotel, there was an Officer's Ball. Samantha looked nice in a black dress, though she still had the maturity of a 13 year old.

Berlin is a sprawling city that is much larger than New York (though it's not as densely populated). This episode began with her enjoying a cruise. She stopped by the Reichtag and the Brandenburg Gate. Samantha then did the impossible and entered a museum, the Pergamon Museum. It had artifacts from the ancient city of Babylon. She visited Alexander Platz, which is located in the former East Berlin (which is much more developed than it was prior to 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down). She stayed at the Hotel Velvet, which included a breakfast buffet and only cost $165 (miracles happen). She stopped by a Jewish cemetery (not the Holocaust Memorial). Samantha used a train to get around called the S-Bahn. Samantha explained how to purchase tickets (Rick Steves must have been giving her tips). She purchased a 3 day travel pass for 21 euros, which is also good for theatre tickets and sightseeing tours.

Samantha visited the remaining portion of the Berlin Wall as well as KaDeWe, which is the largest department store in Europe (it's even larger than Harrods). However, Samantha did not visit Potsdamer Platz, which is the Berlin version of Times Square.

In the Munich episode, she began at Marienplatz, which is the downtown area. She then headed to the top of St. Peter's Church. She used a tram to get around. She also rode a bike. For 15 euros a day, a person can ride a bike. Samantha said that Hitler wrote the infamous Mein Kampf in Munich. She stayed at the Cortina Hotel for $200 a night. While Samantha was getting around, she spoke broken German. Samantha visited the English Garden, which is a city park. My biggest pet peeve is that she left Munich 4 days BEFORE Oktoberfest began. In case you're unfamiliar, Oktoberfest is one of Europe's most popular festivals. It features music, beer drinking, dancing, and amusement park rides. Was she so concerned about the censors that she chickened out?

Just when I was starting to like Samantha, she pulled this stunt.",1427932800,,4239,4.659090909090909

8195954,3,B000QFAFO0,"Many travel documentaries have the same defect. The presenter takes too much of the time. A little more than 20 minutes for Berlin or Vienna is not enough, but if miss Brown takes ten of these 20 minutes...She is pretty and speaks well, but...
Interesting, enjoyable but not nearly enough.
