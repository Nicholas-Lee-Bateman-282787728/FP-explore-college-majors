7904830,5,B000006QHS,Excellent.  Received on time and as described.  Thank you.,1466899200,,58,5.333333333333333
7904831,1,B000006QHS,"While I find the array of commentators they've assembled rather impressive, I was shocked at the inane statements the majority of them found to say about this great figure from the history of the Western World. I would never want her portrait to be sanitized, for she certainly had her flaws and faults, but she was the first female to get and keep the throne in Western Europe for the remarkable decades that she did.  Her strategies for doing so are worthy of careful scrutiny, but some of the scholarly commentators simply pass her off as a Machiavellian manipulator and leave it at that, without citing any evidence or examining her strategic maneuvers for keeping the throne and for keeping peace in England.

The other commentators seem to me to be drawn from the ranks of Romance novelists who have written steamy novels based on (I use the term loosely) the life of Elizabeth, and whose agenda seems to be to romanticize her life-- completely bypassing the brilliant political mind she was, not to mention the splendid overall scholar she was, in general.

So, we're left with a bunch who keep calling her a Machiavellian schemer or a conniving manipulator (without giving any evidence), on the one hand, and on the other, a bunch who want to paint her as the deep and passionate lover who sacrificed her love life publicly so that she could yield in private as submissively as the perfect fantasy heroine who lives only to be treated and mistreated by the man of her obsessions.

In sum, the overall misogynistic content of this Biography is, simply put, staggering.  Rosalind Miles's final summation of Queen Elizabeth's life is the most outrageous and, finally, most unacceptable statement, at least to myself and to (I hope) those of us who take scholarship on this remarkable world leader seriously:

""In the end, she had the love of her countrymen, she had the love of a good man, and she died in her own bed.  What more can a woman want?"" she says, glowingly, admiringly.

So, THAT's the final word on one of the greatest leaders of the Western World?  Rubbish.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Buy the History Channel version with Dr. David Starkey instead.  It's not without its downsides, but at least it presents some real political history and some real evidence why this woman remains among the most important historical figures of all time.",1408406400,,2366,4.772058823529412
7904832,3,B000006QHS,I like this VHS because it gives a great summary of Elizabeth's life.  I wish this was available on DVD.,1365292800,,104,4.2
7904833,5,B000006QHS,Enjoyable and lively survey of the life of the great Virgin Queen.  It is too bad this is out of print.  I hope they will re-issue it.,1320537600,,134,3.925925925925926
7904834,3,B000006QHS,"I use this in my classroom.  It shows some of the controversies and scandals leading up to and during Elizabeth I's reign.  A lot of these are things you don't read about in the textbooks.  My main complaint is that it paints a very critical portrait of the queen.  Even though I don't agree with the opinions expressed, I use it to counter my own opinions.  I speak very favorably of Queen Elizabeth and then I tell my students that the video shows another view.",1294099200,,463,4.4
7904835,1,B000006QHS,"These historians need to get their facts straight and down to the truth in order to do their job properly. Queen Liz The First, was and will always be one of the great leaders who had ruled upon this earth. Unlike other politicians, she put aside her personal life to serve the lives of the English people. It's upsetting to have these ""so-called"" historians and The A&E Network (whose programs I usually admire) not indulging more of the correct facts about her and The Tudor Lineage. All I can say is...please read up more on her history before speaking and putting together a biography that's biased and not slopped hurredly together. There are much better films out there...few, but there are some. Not worth the $.",1038787200,14,719,4.714285714285714
7904836,3,B000006QHS,"Being an Elizabeth fan I bought this video and was both informed and disappointed by it. Though it has plenty of talking heads and lots of rich camerawork, there is something lacking about the show-perhaps it needs to be longer or discuss Elizabeth's motivations more. Sort of reminds me of something you'd see on Lifetime.",1034812800,6,323,4.890909090909091
7904837,1,B000006QHS,"Although there were some good moments in this biography, I was disappointed by the negative light in which it portrayed the Queen.  Queen Elizabeth is certainly not without faults, but one of the ""historians"" who narrated this biography asserted that Queen Elizabeth did nothing to advance the role of England in the world.  He asserts that the wealth and status of England after her reign was in spite of her, not because of her.  Furthermore, this particular historian, asserts his strong belief that Queen Elizabeth had a duty to her country to marry and produce an heir to the thrown.  In my opinion, this belief is what colors his view of the great Queen.  His lack of understanding of Queen Elizabeth's difficult decision to remain unmarried is a disappointing display of his masoginistic attitude towards the role of women in leadership.  The History Channel does a much better biography on Queen Elizabeth.  If this is any indication as to the quality of the work done by A&E, I will not be eager to buy other biographies.",1015977600,19,1030,4.818181818181818
7904838,3,B000006QHS,"Though informative, I was disappointed with this Biography.  For the most part, it was a good, overall view of Elizabeth's life.  Unfortunately, the biography also contained historical inaccuracies and opinions or  speculations of certain historians presented as facts.  For instance, the  video mentioned the Lady Jane Grey's marriage to John Dudley's oldest son  Guildford.  Actually, there were three other Dudley boys older than  Guildford.  And while this is a trivial fact, I wouldn't expect to find  even such small, easily correctable inaccuracies in a historical biography.  The things that bothered me the most though were the assumptions and  opinions about certain areas of Elizabeth's life that were presented as  fact.  Personally, I think Elizabeth was one of the most fascinating and  brilliant monarchs that perhaps the world has ever had.  At times this  biography depicted her as an indecisive, weak woman and turned many of her  greatest and most intelligent accomplishments into either pure luck or  success on the part of her advisors.  This biography claims near the end  that Elizabeth at her death had done nothing about the problems that had  plagued England when she came to the thrown, which is completely untrue.  She brought more peace, prosperity, and religious freedom to the people of  England than they had ever known, and I think she deserves the credit she  earned for that.  So while good facts are presented, take this video with a  grain of salt.",945734400,,1485,5.156118143459915
