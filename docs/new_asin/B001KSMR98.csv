8697894,1,B001KSMR98,"Do not buy this product. Whether you have dance experience or not, you are better off watching a bunch of dance videos off of the internet. The video quality is cheap, and the dance moves are very basic. The title of each move is practically what it actually is. For example: there is a dance move called the ""box"" that is taught in the DVD. The ""box"" is practically moving your feet in a square-like movement, that's it. You may learn a thing or two from the DVD, but it isn't worth the twenty dollars. And as you can see above me is a review with 5 stars. That review is from the creators of this DVD...which doesn't seem to be an actual costumer. Therefore, it seems they are trying to save themselves by giving themselves 5 stars to change the overall rating. DO NOT ME FOOLED.",1266883200,,781,4.319727891156463
