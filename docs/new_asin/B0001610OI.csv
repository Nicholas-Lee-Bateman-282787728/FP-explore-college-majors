8007012,4,B0001610OI,"A pretty good complimentary piece to the original TV series and a bridge to the first movie as episodes 3-4 of the first DVD detail the characters during their summer break as high school students (in the TV series, they were in junior high). In those episodes in the second half of the DVD, you'll be introduced to Kyosuke's cousin Akane, who also appeared in the original manga. I would consider the first two episodes as extensions of the TV series though. It was quite an enjoyable first half of the 8 episode series and it's an enjoyable watch, from the colorful characters to the excellent voice acting of its' cast. I would say it has aged well in the animation department and offers plenty of Kyosuke/Madoka goodness. There is some fanservice moments included, but they're done in a tasteful manner.

The new opening song wasn't to my liking though as far as how it was presented, a collage of the best Kyosuke/Madoka moments would've made it better, rather than just showing the scene of their first meeting. The ending song was rather cool in showcasing Madoka and Hikaru in various outfits and they looked good in what was shown on them. Animeigo could've done a better job with the menus and offered some extra features though. At any rate, this was a good purchase and would recommend it to fans of old-school anime.",1369353600,,1329,4.67948717948718

8007014,4,B0001610OI,"It's an interesting dramedy about a family trying to get established in a new town while concealing their mild psychic powers.  There is a really good review off-site that I'd recommend over my summary.[..]

I felt the series was very entertaining and demonstrated well the mood and culture of Japan, having been there myself three times.",1185408000,2,338,5.017857142857143
