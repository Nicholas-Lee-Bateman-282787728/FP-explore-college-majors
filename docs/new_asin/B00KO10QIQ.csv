6435285,1,B00KO10QIQ,"I am not sure what to make of this hot mess of a movie.
Most will base this movie solely from the Warner Brothers ""The Wizard of Oz"" movie where annoying farmgirl was given a pair of slippers and a hit list with the enemies of Galinda. .err. Glinda the ""Good"" Witch to kill. To her understanding, these were to be done before she could go home. The same broken home that she ran away from in the first place.
One cannot help but question where Dorthy's birth parents were during all this? Being raised by two feeble old people and a few overly friendly with a minor farmhands is an area of concern worth noting.
After the life and times of Elphaba Thropp of the bastar . .duh.. uh.. pu pro product of a one-night stand child of drugged Melena Thropp by a traveling saleman who was later employed as a ""Wizard"" of Oz (goes to show ALL politicians have ""dirty"" in their past), I figured this movie would be a continuation of where the events ended.
Not so.
Elphaba Thropp, collectively known as the ""Wicked Witch"" did not actually die as we were lead to believe, but ran off secretly with her lover Fieyro. Fieyro, as we all know, is the the ""Scarecrow"" to whom she created by default in trying to save his life to avoid being tortured to death. Does he know the ""Witch"" here?
No.
The Lion Cub, who later grew up to be the ""Cowardly Lion"", she saved from the diabolical hands of her professor Doctor Dillamond. The very life he is able to enjoy due to her humanitarian efforts, does he show any signs of gratitude?
Of course not.
The Tinman, Boq, another life she saved from suffering a painful death of a rapidly shrinking heart by the incompetant and ungrateful hands of who she believed to be her sister Nessarose . Her sister, unable to walk since birth, was given the gift of being able to walk by the ""witch"".
Granted, a house fell on her, so we may never know if she had a change of heart. Up until that point, she was going a bit Cathy Bates from 'Misery' with her soon to be Tinman.
At how do all these people whose lives have been impacted for the better show their gratitude?
They try to hunt her down and kill her.
Worse, they smile, sing songs or dance to music off screen about it all.
This movie is no more good for children than a Happy Meal is good for children's health and well-being.
Had I known this before hand, I would of not taken my three adult boys to see this movie. Although, I doubt one of them actually saw it since he was with his boyfriend. That is something I am still coming to terms with since his boyfriend is a few years older than me. They are in love, so I can't judge.
That said, it's still a better movie than some of the other ""Oz"" takes I have seen even since ""The Wiz"".
We miss you Michael and Richard.",1405296000,4,2744,4.248565965583174

6435293,3,B00KO10QIQ,"Lets face it, had CG film making been around back in 1939, its almost a given that the original Wizard of Oz would have been a fully animated film.  The fantastical element, the characters, the locations; they all lend themselves to the fully rendered medium.  So the logic, then, in 2013s Legends of Oz: Dorothys Return is very clear.  We have CG today and Dorothys adventures in the mythical land of Oz go beyond what was covered in the original movie; lets go back and do it all again with modern technology on our side.

The theory is great- and the films producers even went above and beyond to assemble a powerhouse cast here: Dan Aykroyd as the Scarecrow, Kelsey Grammer as the Tin Man, Jim Belushi as the Lion, Patrick Stewart as Tugg, Martin Short as the Jester just to mention a few.  Yet somehow, it doesnt take long for the proverbial wheels to come off the train.  But before we get to that, lets take a brief look at some numbers.

The film premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France on June 14, 2013 and was released in the United States and Canada on May 9, 2014.  The theatrical film was unsuccessful both critically and commercially, grossing only $18.7 million worldwide against a $70 million budget.  It was then released domestically on DVD and Blu-ray on August 26, 2014.  Somehow, despite losing a lot of money and credibility, the studio says that a pair of sequels and a TV series based on the mythos are in development.

So whats the story all about you ask?  Well to summarize it loosely, its only been the span of a single day for Dorothy in Kansas (despite the arrival of cars straight out of 1977) when her friends in Oz need her help to rid the land of evil once more.

A cowboy-boot wearing Dorothy hustles on back to the magical land only to discover her old pals Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion have been kidnapped and tied up by the late Wicked Witch of the Wests brother, Jester (Martin Short).  Even Glinda (Bernadette Peters), the good witch, is locked up in a glass display case along with the rest of Oz's leaders thanks to said Jester.

This leaves Dorothy (and the audience) with a brutally uneventful slog across the land with host of forgettable B-listers like Wiser the Owl (Oliver Platt), Marshal Mallow (Hugh Dancy) and China Princess (Megan Hilty).  If this summary sounds sloppy and poorly plotted, just wait until its stretched out across 1 hour, 28-minutes!

Perhaps therein-lies the biggest fault of the film- all of the pieces for success are here but somehow none of it comes together, even briefly, to form an enjoyable experience.  We have a fantastical land literally begging for the CG treatment, we have a vocal cast who should, theoretically, have no trouble making us laugh, we have musical numbers scattered about with the type of regularity witnessed in say Disneys much better Frozen.  There are even a couple of jokes that work (there is a reason the line about being judged by a jury of ones peeps made the trailers, its one of the only truly funny moments in the whole production).  Considering directors Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre are both Disney veterans, its tough to put a finger on exactly where this piece derails.

But derails it does and in fairly short order besides.  The pacing and lack of layered wit will likely leave adults yawning and checking the time frequently while youngsters will become bored even quicker.  There is absolutely nothing about the world building or character development here that warrants viewer dedication.  Instead the project comes off as a by-the-numbers romp from one locale to the next before ultimately achieving victory as anticipated.  Maybe this isn't so bad a crime for any film, the trouble is with a legacy like the Wizard of Oz behind it, Dorothys Returns lackluster delivery feels all the more dramatic.

The animation itself is also substandard for the most part, coming off in presentation closer to what we now associate with weekly CG animated television series than the stuff of international theatrically released 3D films.  I, however, don't dwell too heavily upon this as a subscriber to the theory that beautiful visuals do not a compelling film make and vise versa.

All in all though, Legends of Oz: Dorothys Return comes off as a very poor attempt at capitalizing on a license with a positive association for millions worldwide.  It isn't unwatchable by any means so much as there are glimpses all around as to what the film could have been if assembled properly:  An endearing fantasy romp in the tradition of pieces like Dinseys Tangled or Frozen.  Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks this production most certainly is not.

To end things on a positive note- the concept of revisiting Dorothys adventures in Oz in the realm of CG hasn't been completely in vain as Amazon has an original series through its Prime membership program called Lost in Oz that much better conveys ideas mishandled here.",1486684800,,4958,4.755841121495327

6435305,4,B00KO10QIQ,"Coming from a family who practically lives off the original movie, I avoided watching this for quite a while. After actually watching it, though? I loved it! The characters are rather well-done, I would say that even the running jokes didn't run long enough to become grating, and most of the songs were really good! I'd seen the Jester made out to be extremely annoying in other reviews, but his over-the-top acting really fits the role.

There's only one reason why I didn't give this a 5-star rating.

HOW DO YOU HAVE BERNADETTE PETERS IN YOUR MOVIE CHOCK FULL OF SONGS AND NOT HAVE HER SING? That was extremely disappointing after the excitement of seeing her name in the opening sequence.

Other than that? Absolutely recommended.",1463443200,,735,4.817460317460317

6435366,2,B00KO10QIQ,"So, Dorothy Gale is back in Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return, an animated film based on a book by Roger S. Baum, the great-grandson of L. Frank Baum. My simple question is, well, Do we really need this story? But the list of the names of the players providing voices is pretty impressive, so I gave it a try anyway. Perhaps I shouldnt have.

The result was very disappointing. Picking up where the original classic film left off, the story is about Dorothy (Lea Michele) who is summoned to the Land of Oz. She has to stop the Jester (Martin Short), a villain planning to take over the Land of Oz.

Familiar characters appear, including Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd), Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer), and Lion (James Belushi), but they have little to do with the main story about Dorothy which is not very interesting. New characters are flat and boring.

With its not-so-impressive animation and musical part, Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return is just another sequel that we really don't need.",1421107200,,977,4.735294117647059

Legends of Oz Dorothys Return deals with the events around Dorothy and her friends having to restore Oz back to a land of sunshine (on a literal and metaphoric  level).  Only this time, Dorothy and her friends are going to contend with the witchs brother who is emotionally painted to be even more scheming than his sister. Strangely Enough, the movie foreshadows the type of characters that Dorothy is going to have to deal with when the Kansas home that her family lives in is in danger of being sold and permanently given to a shady businessman.

6435400,2,B00KO10QIQ,"Just finished watching ""Legends of OZ - Dorothy's Return"" released by 20th Century Fox.
I really wanted to like this movie.
When Jeff H. and I saw the trailers for this latest OZ movie back in theaters last year, it looked very intriguing.  However when it was released in theaters it was a blink and you missed it moment.  That was my first clue.
No Jeff H. did not watch ""Legends of OZ - Dorothy's Return"" with me.  Unlike Zack, mention ""musical"" to Jeff H. and he runs out of the room as fast as he can.  [Though  Jeff H. did confess to liking Gilligan's Island - The Musical that I took him, Zack, and Rizzo too.]
For reasons still not clear to me, Dorothy's Kansas has been updated to modern day times and she's a throughly modern girl.  It doesn't work.
The animation is great, but great animation can not fill an entire movie, nor can hacking apart the original novel Dorothy of OZ for the screenplay make a great movie.
There is one redeeming factor in this movie - the duet ""Even Then"" is a heartfelt song of love almost lost and second chancesthat transcends the movie's awlfulness.
Only Recommended for the duet ""Even Then"".

I thought the colorful animation was amazing. This is the perfect movie to introduce your younger kids to your favorite childhood movie. I remember the first time I tried to get Handsome and Goddess to watch The Wizard of Oz when they were 3 or 4 and it was all lost on them. They just weren't into it. Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return is funny, colorful, witty and musical.

The movie opens with a dark Emerald City.  Oz has been taken over by a mean Jester who is the brother of the Wicked Witch. He isn't as mean but does have the assistance of those flying monkeys. The Tin Man, Scarecrow and Lion (just lion because he is no longer a coward) decide they need Dorothy return to help them.  Scarecrow has created an invention called the Rainbow Mover and try to get a message to Dorothy.

Meanwhile Dorothy is waking up in her bed. She heads outside and finds her aunt and uncle assessing the damage from the tornado.  The damage is beyond repair and the town is being forced to give up their homes to a government appraiser who is condemning every house.

Another storm comes and Dorothy and Toto are swept up into a rainbow where she receives messages from her friends.

Back at the Emerald City, the Jester has captured Glinda along with many other of Oz's people and is making them into marionettes.

Dorothy must rescue her friends and help defeat the Jester.

Pros:
Wonderful computer animation
Available in 3D (I have not seen it yet but can't wait to check it out)
Our favorite characters from the original movie are back
There are a slew of new, helpful characters
New songs to love
Lea Michele as Dorothy
Adorable Toto
Good messages about helping others, being yourself and standing up for yourself

Cons:
Not enough Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion

Perfect movie for the whole family.  I am unsure as to why the movie didn't do better, it was funny and entertaining.",1410825600,3,1893,4.516129032258065

And the animated backgrounds and sets look like they come right from the classic ""Wizard of Oz"" movie. The film itself was enjoyable by my children, but it only held there interest at certain points in the film. This was the only animated movie that my children watched where they didn't beg me to buy the DVD. In fact, as soon as Rio 2 came out in theaters this movie was quickly forgotten.  The whole film plays out like one of those direct to DVD movies that Disney produced back in the 90s.

6435433,4,B00KO10QIQ,"Being a fan of good fantasy and especially of  Baums stories of Oz, I was interested to see if this version (aimed for kids, I think) would
hold up to what I deem as good story telling.  I feared the animation would be the 1960s type, stiff and dull looking.  But as an animation fan,
especially of classic animation, I find this film an excellent use of computer animation.  The movements realistic, very fluid and well drawn
and voiced with a good cast.  There is some singing (which I generally dislike) but it fits in well with the narrative here.  The characters are
well drawn and designed, though I thought Glinda looked a little anemic ( could use some meat on her bones) and had  a good choice of
new characters.  The story is only loosely based on the original ideas and varies considerably from the later books of Baums, but it is fun
and children will certainly like it.  I thought the backgrounds were superbly done, nice 3D rendering effects, good though kind of weird City
of Emeralds and a magnificent version of the Witches castle with all the towering turrets  and walls.  As good (and probably better) than the
great one in the MGM masterpiece.  The film did not quite has the mysticism or dream-like quality of the MGM movie, but still an artistic
gem.  And well done flying monkeys.  I would love to sic them on Dr Sweets and Martha.  Oh well, I can dream can't I?  Four stars only
because I had hoped I would see a good version of the sequel books that followed THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Still, this one is a winner.  I got

6435447,4,B00KO10QIQ,"I saw this in the theaters with my 2 kids, ages 12 and 5.  They both enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a little different from the Pixar and DreamWorks movies that always have a lot of embedded innuendo and references for adults. This was squarely aimed at the kids, and they laughed and smiled all the way through. It's very innocent, and has plenty of charm for younger kids. It isn't that great for adults, but the songs are all good quality and it's fun to identify the voices. I recommend it for families with young children: you won't have to worry about inappropriate material and the kids will be entertained.",1407974400,26,612,4.513513513513513
6435448,5,B00KO10QIQ,"I was able to see this animated version of the continuing story of Oz in the theatre when it was released and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is sad that it did not get more attention and frankly received some negative reviews.  Yet, most who saw it had very positive responses.  The animation is ""pixar-ish"" and very well-done.  The musical score and songs are on par with any animated features in recent memory.  The character voices are well-known and well-casted.  Overall, the story-telling best communicates emotionally and with young viewers, whether male or female. I especially recommend it to families with kids in elementary school. It is a refreshing addition to the Oz collections.  Highly recommended.",1407974400,6,709,5.121739130434783

6435458,4,B00KO10QIQ,"In this animation Dorothy returns to Oz to rescue it from the fool that has taken over the land. The wicked witch turned her brother into a jester who has her broomstick  and controls the ""fuzzy evolutionary rejects"" or Flying Monkeys. Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Lion have become almost stooge like with the Tin Man being overly melodramatic.

Dorothy's fame allows her to skirt the law and get special favors. She is aided by an obese owl, a marshmallow law enforcement officer, a conceited china doll princess, and an old tree who wants to die.

The humor is geared to kids. It does not have that clever duo meaning so adults can enjoy the film on a different level.",1406419200,12,668,4.55

8660348,1,B00KO10QIQ,"Let me begin with saying this: I gave this movie a chance. I really did. And I hereby give all actors involved this message: I don't blame you- it's not your fault, a job is a job, after all- (plus the pre viz was not all that bad) and I can clearly hear how little enjoyment some of you had filming this. And for that I am sincerely, truly sorry your name is on the cover of. . .THIS. This movie. (Deep breath, exhales) As a film is a group project, I'd like to give a benefit of the doubt to the filmmakers involved and kudos for putting their time and effort into the movie, because it's a big job and often a fragmented, complicated process that depends on the success of hundreds working together to create a final product.

That said. . .this may be my least favorite film of all time!

Let's take a look back at the original MGM movie starring Judy Garland. It's an amazing film with brilliant practical effects and a boatload of fun, unique characters. Our mains, the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Lion are shadows, caricatures of their former selves. And they're in peril for most of the movie! Instead of the characters we're supposed to know and love (and fail miserably at their job, despite the stellar actors assigned to their voices), we're stuck with a chattier version of the Tootsie Roll Pop owl, a literal marshmallow man and a bratty china princess who said marshmallow man. . .falls in love with and sings to, after she literally SHATTERS her previous suitors? Huh?! Is there something I missed here?! The villain is portrayed vibrantly by Martin Short, who is a master of all things funny, but unfortunately even his comedy skills couldn't save the often creepy, Joker-like character from ruining a happy moment and making both the kids and grown ups feel unsettled as he literally hovers over the whole scene like a grinning goblin. He actually turns Glinda into a mindless puppet who does his bidding and is controlled by him! It's honestly pretty close to ""Coraline"", another film I am NOT a fan of, in the creep factor. He also plans to turn the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion into his puppets (which thankfully, doesn't happen) but the idea itself is terrifying. He's already succeeded with some of the leaders of Oz, who sing and dance in monotone voices. Excuse me- this is supposed to be a KIDS' movie?

This film is king when it comes to throwing left-of-left-field flyballs at you- and offering no explanation. For example: Patrick Stewart was tasked with voicing a sentient tree. Doesn't sound too bad. Then they- chop him down and turn him into a boat?! He's still alive and intact, thank goodness, but- WHAT? Also, they sing an entire song about building said boat. Don't ask, I forgot it a long time ago. As well as pretty much all the other songs. Later on they are attacking the Jester and his simian minions with- gumballs- even the tree gets in on the action! At this point my brain gave up and I began to get an actual, 100 percent real headache from the sheer ridiculousness of what I was seeing. No kidding. But wait- it gets better! Later on (spoilers, but really, it's not worth it) the china princess breaks and the marshmallow man- melts part of his marshmallow self to repair her. While singing. (Insert long, drawn-out groan here) Unfortunately, this was the one song that I still remember a tiny snippet of. There's also a licensed reference to Peeps in this, someone actually makes the joke by using the word ""peeps"" in a sentence. That's how hard this movie tries to be cool for the younguns'. Unfortunately, it's not. Cool OR for the younguns'. If I were you, I'd stick with Judy Garland and the original gang.",1511827200,,3657,4.580152671755725
