8745294,5,B019HTRSRW,"Thanks to this superb Criterion Special Edition DVD, I have finally closed a longstanding gap in my knowledge of the great French New Wave films.  I had always read that this Jacques Rivette dbut feature was among the most indispensable French films of this period (planned for release in 1959, but delayed two years due to financial setbacks), and it is all that and more.  [Sadly, Jacques Rivette passed away earlier this year at the age of 87.]

It is an endlessly intriguing mixture of coming-of-age story (the protagonist being a rather ingenuous young woman from the provinces), death investigation (as this demoiselle drifts curiously into her own investigation of a pair of suspicious deaths deemed suicides), and both a psychological and political thriller.  Any number of fascinating Parisian milieus are glimpsed, from the cramped and crowded to the sporadically more scenic (in the background), with particular emphasis on the artistic-intellectual-bohemian and theatrical.

The young woman, Anne. is put through a labyrinthine journey of contradictions, making it a constant challenge to sort out what is real and what is the product of the imaginings and possibly even paranoid delusions of others (involving an international Fascist plot for world domination, no less).  Betty Schneider's performance is so completely convincing and real-feeling (over the two-hour twenty-minute-long film) it never appears to be acting at all; even, ironically, when she is acting in an obscure Shakespearean play within the film.  The introduction to the contradictory, double-edged nature of the film occurs in the opening title sequence as a train (presumably bringing Anne to the big city where she intends to enroll as a university student) approaches the station.  The film's title ""Paris Belongs to Us"" is shown, but it is then followed by its famous-quote subtitle, ""Paris belongs to no one.""

There is a pervasive ominousness to the black and white cinematography of the city and a sense of imminent, lurking, conspiratorial danger, as death may (or may not) be stalking certain characters in Anne's new sphere - thus making herself vulnerable (or not) by continuing to probe.

 This is truly a brilliantly conceived, protracted puzzle that is set up by the filmmaker/co-scenarist, as he defies almost every purely conventional feature film device in common use prior to the scenario's conception in 1957.  Certainly, the release delay caused some of the film's thunder to be stolen by his ""Cahiers du Cinma"" fellow critics-turned-filmmaker associates' (Chabrol, Truffaut, Godard) New Wave feature-film dbuts in the interim; but seen now and placed into its proper time-frame perspective, one can fully appreciate the mastery of its invention.

The digitally restored print and new English subtitles are outstanding, and the extras are excellent and enlightening (a 25-minute interview with author, professor and Jacques Rivette expert Richard Neupert; and a six-page booklet essay by Luc Sante); but it's the inclusion of Rivette's New Wave-precursor, 29-minute, 1956 short film ""Le Coup du berger"" that is the ultimate coup here.  Co-written with Claude Chabrol, and also featuring Godard and Truffaut as background players, it's a clever adultery-themed comedy with a chess sequence-of-moves parallel.  It is really more of a stylistic exercise than anything else, but it does co-star the New Wave's pet young actor, the always fun-to-watch Jean-Claude Brialy (who unsurprisingly also appears in ""Paris Belongs to Us"").",1466467200,6,3530,5.427787934186472
8745295,4,B019HTRSRW,"Paris Belongs to Us (French title: Paris nous appartient) is the first feature by Jacques Rivette (Celine and Julie Go Boating), a former critic for Cahiers du Cinema. Made on small budget, Paris Belongs to Us is an early example of the French New Wave, later popularized by Chabrol, Truffaut, and Godard. Though it never achieved the popularity of such films as The 400 Blows and Breathless, it portrays the radical flavor that would define the movement that captured young Parisian idealists of the mid-1950s.

Anne Goupil (Betty Schneider) is a young literature student living in a Paris student hostel, whose brother Pierre (Francois Maistre), draws her into the intrigues of his bohemian circle, the conspiracy theories of the blacklisted American writer Philip Kaufman (Daniel Crohem), and the artistic ambitions of theatre director Gerard Lenz (Giani Esposito), who is staging a low-budget production of Pericles.

Filmed in pieces between 1958 and 1960 because of money problems, the movie was finally released in 1961. Shooting in black and white, Rivette weaves an atmosphere of paranoia, preoccupation with conspiracy, and a sense of post-World War II disillusionment combined with an often playful fascination with theatrical performance. Its notable for capturing, like a time capsule, a distinct era, and provides some great views of the streets and hustle-bustle of the Left Bank. At 141 minutes, the movie is overly long and could have benefited from tighter editing.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include an interview with the author of a book on the French New Wave; Jacques Rivettes short 1956 film Le coup de berger, featuring fellow New Wave directors Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, and Francois Truffaut; and a critical essay. The movie is a new digital restoration, In French, with English subtitles.",1457136000,12,1832,5.288659793814433
8745296,5,B019HTRSRW,"A few critics, noting Rivette's general lack of recognition in comparison with Truffaut, Godard, Rohmer and Chabrol, have wondered if his ""late start"" might have had anything to do with it; this film didn't have its American release until 1962 or a British premiere until 1964 by which point the New Wave was already a well-established ""movement"" in people's minds and this long 16mm talk-fest about conspiracies and theater must have looked weird and out of place even compared to the experimentation of Godard.

I'm not so sure. Rivette's films have usually been hermetic worlds unto themselves, most readily relatable to each other and to the worlds of theater and other movies - apart from LA RELIGIEUSE all of Rivette's work over his first 30 years of feature-making seem to inhabit what has been called his ""House of Fiction"", an area just a little off from the real world and one in which obsession, madness, and duration (at 140 minutes PARIS is one of his shortest films) rule. Also his focus on the lives and romances of women and the near-exclusion of the kinds of macho American gangster-influenced characters that inhabit many of Godard's and Truffaut's early films wouldn't be likely to endear him to wider audiences. Interestingly enough, Rivette is just as obsessed with Americana as his contemporaries, and in fact the first words spoken in this film are in English, haltingly read aloud by a young woman in a tiny and somewhat decrepit apartment in Paris.

Before this, as the credits roll, we see Paris, a grimy, silent and derelict-looking 19th-century city of endless 5 to 7 story apartments and wide but empty streets; our first view is from an unseen train, accompanied by eerie music heavy on wailing strings and percussion (by Phillippe Arthuys - the soundtrack is spare but frightening and beautiful throughout). A title, ""June 1957"" and we enter the world of Anne, our young reader, and her contemporaries, a lost and unfocused group of intellectuals, bohemians, actors and writers. Anne hears crying and screaming from an apartment next door - the young woman within seems both upset (in tears) and ecstatic - she know's Anne's brother, Pierre, who apparently is in danger from somewhere, something, somewhat - it is unclear - the same danger that ""murdered"" Juan, and before him Assunta. She has the look of excited madness as she claims that the whole world, in fact, is in danger. Anne is confused; she meets Pierre at a caf, and he shrugs it off.

Next we find Anne and Pierre both at a party, lots of mostly young intellectuals squeezed into another tiny apartment - a man plays guitar and the conversation revolves around this same Juan (who was also a guitarist, and composer), only it appears that he committed suicide -- or did he? We are also introduced to Philip Kaufman, apparently a famous American writer though he seems destitute and unhinged here. There are cameos by the director and Claude Chabrol, and the talk is charged and political, but direction-less. Snatches of conversation, withheld glances bespeak something going on, conspiracies and traitors and some evil that hangs over everyone...eventually Anne accompanies Philip on a long walk (filmed very much like a scene out of a hard-edged American noir) where he expounds on his own conspiracy theories. Everything it seems revolves around this Juan, and when Anne falls in with a troupe of actors rehearsing a seemingly impossible adaptation of Shakespeare's Pericles she finds out that the music to it was by Juan, but it is apparently lost.

Gerard, the play's director, soon casts Anne as a replacement for one of his many departing actors; there is much made of people leaving and disappearing throughout the film, often for unsaid or unknown reasons. Anne and Gerard become romantically entwined also, but like most romances in the film it is ephemeral and unpredictable, and both have other entanglements. Eventually Anne takes it upon herself to find a tape of this music, which becomes the driving force of the latter half of the film, if this portrait of half-truths and romantic obsessions with dark powers and political intrigues can be said to have a real plot at all. It's a red herring, of course, much like the Maltese falcon, another homage to or parallel with the world of noir - in fact psychologically, if not plot-wise, this may be the most noirish of all the early New Wave films.

I first saw Paris probably 15 years ago in the crappy old cut version available on VHS in the USA and this was my first re-watch, in the fine recent release from the BFI on Region 2 DVD. It's fascinating to return to it again after having seen nearly all of the director's subsequent work and to find that nearly all of his great themes and interests are present in this first feature made 50 years ago: complex romantic tangles, obsessions with conspiracies that may or may not exist, the city as playground, female friendships, theater - nearly all of Rivette's life's work can be found in nascent form here. One marked difference from everything that comes after is in the soundtrack, post-synchronized here, and this is rather unnerving when one is used to the direct sound that the director has mastered. Yet it works in Paris, the lack of street noises and the focus on individual voices and the eerie soundtrack music contributing to a view of the city as nightmarish, a place of loners and loneliness, of the permanent outsiders, of madness in the face of an obscure modern world. The last scene, as Anne's gaze wanders off following birds flying across the water, is emblematic too of this cryptic loner. Nothing is truly revealed, and more questions remain than were ever answered.

Included on this BFI release also is LE COUP DE BERGER, Rivette's earliest surviving film, a 35mm short (28 minutes).

Claire (Virginie Vitry) is a chic young Parisian woman married to a somewhat older husband, Claude (Jacques Doniol-Valcroze). As this 28-minute trifle opens, she leaves her husband playing baroque music at the piano, telling him she is off to see her sister, Solange. In reality she meets her lover, Jean (Jean-Claude Brialy) at his apartment; after some idle chatter and love-making he tells her a story of the shriveled heads that the Jivaro indians used to give their lovers as tokens of affection but as she shivers in disgust, he gives her a mink instead. How will they hide it from her husband though? An elaborate scheme involving hiding it at a bus terminal where the husband himself will find it and bring it home is concocted but alas the husband is wiser than they think...

A playful and charming little piece seemingly indebted to noir in its conspiratorial storyline and photography - though much lighter than true noir, co-written by Rivette with Charles Bitsch and Claude Chabrol, who appears in a cameo in a party sequence at the end along with Rivette, Jean-Luc Godard and Franois Truffaut, this is Rivette's 4th and last short (28 minutes) before he turned to features. It's his first in 35mm with sound, and the photography (black and white) and mise en scene are quite accomplished if for the most part unspectacular. Several of his trademarks do show up here, including the interest in games and play-acting, conspiracies and young love; also in its use of diagetic sound - as far as I can tell all of the music in the film is by the baroque composer Franois Couperin, but it is heard as part of a typical mimetic sound-scheme, played on the piano in the first scene, and played on record in later scenes. The film is framed as a story of a chess-game, narrated briefly at various points by the director who comments on the story in a droll, ironic manner that reminds me more of early Godard than of Rivette's other work.

An absolutely essential release for all fans of the New Wave, then, and North Americans ought not to hesitate in snapping up this release, as there's no telling when (or if) it will become available here.",1253664000,41,7970,4.828696925329429
