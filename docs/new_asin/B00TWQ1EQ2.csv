7022952,5,B00TWQ1EQ2,"This is their best film yet. Even the lack of subtitles in English was a plus for my students, for they had to really pay attention!",1434240000,,132,4.115384615384615
7022953,5,B00TWQ1EQ2,"It is even better than ""La Leyenda De La Llorona"" it is very good and funny movie, and again I say, ideal for people who really know the Mexican traditions and specially slang, old and new. Note, if you are not familiar with both of them, don't bother, you won't be able to understand the movie. So, if you are trying to ""learn"" Spanish with this, forget it, you won't.",1429401600,,369,4.285714285714286
7022954,5,B00TWQ1EQ2,"This is the third movie of the series, first, la leyenda de la Nahuala, la leyenda de la llorona, and now, la leyenda de las Momias, where supernatural events happens and brave children are the ones who destroyed evil. No suitable for all children, I suggest parents check on previews to decide if these kind of movies are for their children.
I personally emphasized my 3 year old, who loves these kind of movies, that GOD gave us power against all evil ( Luke 10 )...I like my granddaughter don't being afraid of anything.
The movie is in Spanish , another thing I like, for my granddaughter practices her Spanish; )",1425945600,,617,4.5675675675675675

8703237,1,B00TWQ1EQ2,"Poor animation quality, decades old style. 2-D cutouts repeating the same motion. Spanish language only, no English or other language subtitling. Story is not creative or thoughtful.",1475107200,,182,5.777777777777778

8703244,1,B00TWQ1EQ2,"I've seen the first two movies and loved them! Honestly, I couldn't see this movie as clearly because the dvd would skip, start, and stop sporadically. I wanted to exchange for a different copy. I bought it in the Summer of 2015 yet it is now January 2016 and I never heard a response from the sellers.",1453852800,,302,4.315789473684211
