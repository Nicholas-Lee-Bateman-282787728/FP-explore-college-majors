8189805,5,630310455X,"Roots Search is an 1986 OVA and was released in Japanese with English subtitles on VHS, sadly no DVD release has ever materialised. This is a classic science fiction, space opera with lots of horror in it. The character designs are stunning. The music is mostly that of an electronic keyboard and it's awesome. The story centers around a beautiful women called Moira, who trys to work out the msytery of the spaceship and the crew that keep vanishing. A must see for any 80's fan, ignore the critics, they always down mark the old titles.
