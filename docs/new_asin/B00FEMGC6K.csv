8614894,2,B00FEMGC6K,"Vladimir Fedoseyev and his Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra (now: Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra) have given us a splendid Tchaikovsky Cycle on DVD (Arthaus, see my review), recorded live in the Alte Oper Frankfurt 1991, for todays standards in slightly dated video but still in very acceptable audio. At the time of my review of the Tchaikovsky Cycle, I regretted that the Manfred Symphony had been omitted from their program. Now I am not so sure. But first things first:

The new set was recorded live in the Vienna Musikvereins-Saal in March 2009 in good, but not outstanding PCM Stereo. The recording level is fairly low, and you may have to crank up your amplifier. As to the video, it is technically fine, however the camera often bores us with endless pans/zooms of the hall instead of staying with the orchestra sections: this is quite annoying. Long shots of the Musikvereins-Saal show that the camera team was much less interested in the music making than in the venue. Even when the focus is on the musicians or the conductor, it is erratic. This is even more deplorable, as the Moscow musicians as an ensemble as well as in groups or solo work are excellent and deserve better. So does Fedoseyev who has his musicians so well prepared that they play on the beat  not after the beat as many European orchestras do.

I have never fully warmed up to Miaskovskys Cello Concerto, but both the soloist Alexander Knyazev and Fedoseyev with his Muscovites make a very persuasive case for the piece: the playing is warm, idiomatic and engaging. Ill listen to it again.

As to Manfred, I am at a loss. Yes, the score is long and at times noisy, even bombastic. But this is what Tchaikovsky wrote, and as a whole it is cohesive and a quasi-living organism. I can not comprehend that the work is hardly ever performed without disfiguring cuts, done more or less (in)sensibly by the respective conductor. Is the intention to save the audience from boredom  or what? Whichever the reasons might be, I had hoped that Fedoseyev, a first-rank and thoughtful musician, would respect the scores integrity and play it as is. Not so. There are cuts in the first movement and elsewhere and -- even more damaging -- a long cut in the finale, obliterating the organ apotheosis. Thus the beautiful organ in the Musikvereins-Saal remains silent. To me, this is simply not acceptable, even if the playing is very good. However, if you want a truncated Manfred, go for it.",1389657600,,2456,4.755868544600939
