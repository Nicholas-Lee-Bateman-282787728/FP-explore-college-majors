6197600,5,B00HQI72UA,"This is a most excellent series that ran for four seasons, but only one season was ever available in the US. Now if they release the other three seasons I will be very happy. I had to buy the rest from Malasia, which makes quite good discs with good translations, by the way (just make sure never to buy a disc from China, which will list languages as Japanese, English, and Chinese).",1393545600,18,384,4.347222222222222
6197601,5,B00HQI72UA,"I love romantic comedies, Especially harem.  And I love a weak main-character (single or as a team) grow into the true hero(-ine) that will make the romance blossom.

This is a legendary anime of 4 seasons that fits the above description.  I have only reviewed the final season in subtitled form. and it was excellent.  Missed the last time offered on DVD.  Current Amazon pricing of prior DVD Series Ranges from $150.00 to $350.00+

I am going to grab it this time around!  I recommend fans of Romantic Comedies do so as well!",1392076800,15,527,4.602150537634409
6197602,5,B00HQI72UA,"My daughter and I loved this Anime. It's only 13 episodes long. There's no nudity in it, but there are enough sexual references to warrant caution to a parent --but  it isn't anything completely outrageous. There are plenty of underwear gags and failed seduction attempts.

It isn't ground breaking. As plots go, it's pretty formulaic. But it was fun! I laughed out loud, and my ten year old thoroughly enjoyed it. We can't wait for them to dub seasons two and three of this series.",1283904000,2,482,4.658823529411765
6197603,5,B00HQI72UA,the only part i don't like is that they have yet to relese the other 2 seasons,1282867200,,78,3.6470588235294117
6197604,5,B00HQI72UA,"I originally saw this anime on YouTube in Japanese. It's hard to capture to effects of the show when you're doing the English dubbing of anime, but these guys came closer than anyone yet. I am very satisfied with my order, and I await the arrival of the seasons after this one.",1282608000,,277,4.346153846153846
6197605,4,B00HQI72UA,"I'd heard a lot about this show prior to buying, so I was counting down the days until Funimation released it on DVD.
The wait was worth it, because ""Familiar of Zero"" is one of the funniest, most entertaining shows I've seen in a long
while. The two main protagonists, Saito and Louise, have an interesting chemistry which makes for a strong plot foundation,
one that the writers and director build on with a fantastical setting and gut-busting side characters such as the
sultry Kirche and snobby trust-fund brat Guiche. Watching all of these characters interact is the highlight of the show.

Where it disappoints, however, are the action sequences. You never really feel drawn in or excited by the fights, such as
you would in a series like, say, ""Bleach."" They feel rushed, not visceral or heart-pumping. It's much more interesting
during the comedy/romance segments.

The animation (done by JC Staff) is great, and the music is generally good. The opening theme is catchy and infectious, if not
laced with idiotic lyrics that obviously signify that the song was made expressly FOR the show as opposed to a real song being
licensed for use WITH the show. However, the ending theme may very well make you rush for the ""chapter skip"" button on your
remote, because it filled me with a sensation somewhat akin to the feeling you get when somebody runs their nails down a
chalkboard(I think it's sung by the voice actress of Louise, but I' m not sure; either way, skip it, IT'S ANNOYING!!!)

At the end of the day, ""Familiar of Zero"" succeeds as a romance/comedy anime for guys, what with all the blatant fan service
and pervy jokes. That's not to say a girl or woman won't enjoy it, but just be knowledgeable about the target audience. Where
the show stumbles, though, are the action scenes, which could've been fleshed out a tad bit more. Don't let that mark down
dissuade you from buying the show, though, because you'd be missing out on one of the funniest and most zany anime of the year.

6197622,5,B00HQI72UA,"Didn't buy off Amazon, but I bought from my local FYE instead. Awesome, awesome, awesome. This is an ecchi, harem, romance, and fantasy anime with a typical setting and cliches but with superior performance in animation, story writing, and voice acting. There are english dubs for the curious, but this review isn't for those as I probably won't bother watching them.

The packaging is good and I can rest at ease knowing my DVD/Blue-Ray discs are well protected in an easy to use case. Some Sentai releases have not been so good as far as packaging goes, so I thought I'd mention this point especially (cough* Clannad *cough). Definitely worth the money. Please buy it!

I dearly hope Sentai gets the remaining 3 seasons out on DVD soon. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY SENTAI!",1414972800,,772,4.711111111111111

6197628,5,B00HQI72UA,"Familiar of Zero is a great anime with adventure, action, comedy and romance.... ok it is more like minor Masochistic behavior that lead to romance but it part of the comedy. I recommend this anime that like realism with there anime stories even in the face of fantasy. If all else fails got find some one who has it and get a taste of this anime and then you will be hooked, and buy it after that.",1403481600,,398,4.181818181818182
6197629,5,B00HQI72UA,"Amazon bout time you get season 2, 3 and 4. The interchange, and eventual love between Saito and Louise had me laughing over and over. Starting at the lowest level of a familiar and then seeing how they change made this video a must have.",1402876800,,238,4.311111111111111

6197631,5,B00HQI72UA,This is a nice change from the normal way of high school students and their love story. Being set in a cross between two world's and the way the author brings the group together is very well done. This is a good series and it has plenty of room for more to go..,1400112000,4,261,3.943396226415094
6197632,5,B00HQI72UA,"I loved this series from the first time I saw it on instant download.  When I went to buy the DVD there were none for sale except for ridiculously high priced used copies.  I ended up buying all four seasons.of The Familiar of Zero on bootleg out of Malaysia for less than the price of one season of a used legitimate copy.

The bootlegs were pretty bad.  The video was murky and grainy.  The subtitles were soooo bad that most of the time they made no sense at all.  Despite this, I watched and rewatched all four seasons again and again.  Why?  The answer is plot, character development, and romantic comedy.

The anime genre of high school boy being transported to a magical world and becoming a hero is a cliche - it has been done a zillion times.  The Familiar of Zero gives a refreshing new slant to this old story.  New twists and turns to the old story keeps things fresh and interesting.

The hero and the heroine are likeable characters as are the other supporting characters.  The slow development of the romantic relationship between the two main characters is nice to watch.  The script produces lots of laughs and chuckles along the way without forcing anything.  There is fan service, but it is not so overdone that it gets in the way of the plot.  With the big boobs, lingerie jokes, and panty shots parental supervision is advised for the younger kids.

If you like romantic comedies I suggest you take a look at The Familiar of Zero.

I am glad that it is now possible to once again buy a legal copy of The Familiar of Zero.  Hopefully, the sales of the first season will be such that the following three seasons will be released as well.

Now, if they would just bring out an authorized release of Strike Witches: The Movie.",1399939200,6,1743,4.455696202531645
6197633,5,B00HQI72UA,Grate anime really like it hope they release the 2nd season now nice to watch without the pixelation you get from watching it online,1399593600,2,132,4.541666666666667
6197634,5,B00HQI72UA,"The results of most of Louise's spells.  A mage in training who carries the moniker Louise the Zero as almost all her spells end up in disaster.  But on the day that all the mages summons their familiar partners, she happens to summon the most unusual - a human boy from Japan.  Now this unusual pairing is about to take the magic world by storm as it appears Louise is a rare mage of great potential and her partner will shake up what it means to be a familiar - provided the two manage not to kill each other in the meantime.

Just finished this and was absolutely floored on how good it was.  Its full of humor, explosions, and world shaking adventures, with just a bit of fan service - but nothing over the top.  I agree with the rest and I want the other seasons to come over to the US as soon as possible (as well as more JRPG's - but thats a different review).  A must have for any anime fan who is looking for a good story.",1398297600,12,931,4.082417582417582
6197635,5,B00HQI72UA,"I am just so glad to be able to finaly own this anime without having to rob a bank that I can't find anything bad to say other than I want more episodes. It was such a great story and the characters were so well developed and even the acting was great. There actually are three more seasons that were released in Japan, however U.S. sales were low so nothing here. Get busy and wake up and buy this thing so we can get more! I would like to state for those of you who have not seen the anime, and now that you know there are three more seasons; do not worry about the ending. The ending is great!!! and there are no issues totaly left hangiing, though there remains plenty of material to further the story. Buy Buy Buy !!! The Familiar of Zero!
 Anime's this brings to mind for me are Moon Phase, and other romantic comedies. If you like the fussing and fighting couple, you'll love it. I. E. Toradora!, Spice and Wolf, Maid Sama!, Dog and Scissors, and so on.",1397088000,19,960,4.1891891891891895

I also went and got the remaining collections in the 'Familiar' series, even though they were still in Japanese (apparently the parent company was never able to afford to get them translated into English), but it didn't matter.  I thoroughly enjoyed them all, and the first one was not the best of them.  Please enjoy the whole series, and whet your appetite with this first one!",1463788800,,451,4.756410256410256
