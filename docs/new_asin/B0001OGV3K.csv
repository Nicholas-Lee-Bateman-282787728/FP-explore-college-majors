8015674,5,B0001OGV3K,"This movie was wonderful.  Bond, the young boxer, very attractive might I add, has a really rough life.  Nothing seems to go his way, though he stays strong through it all.  His teacher, Kim, who is older, but also very, very pretty, catches his eye through some coincidental circumstances.  Though she is quite drawn to Bond, Kim tries to deny her feelings because of the age/school issue, and also because of a bad relationship she is just entering out of.  Bond pursues her relentlessly however, and eventually she has to give in.  All the while, Bond is training extremely hard for a certain tournament, the Star Runner, and he faces many more challenges in the future.

I don't want to give away much more, but this movie just captures human emotions completely and perfectly.  The actors were extremely well picked, and they deliver a story that is fascinating.  The best part about it is that it could really happen.  It is not far-fetched in any way, and yet, at the same time, it makes your own life seem boring in comparision...or at least it did for me.  All in all, the best word that I can use to describe this film is beautiful.",1117238400,,1142,4.5763546798029555
