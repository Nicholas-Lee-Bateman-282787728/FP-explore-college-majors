7333012,5,B011ID14F2,"I almost bought the box set last year specifically for this movie but didn't pull the trigger. Now they're releasing it as a stand alone. Nice. High five to myself. Like most die hard Halloween fans we're all aware of the story behind the producers cut . It's just sad Donald Pleasence died shortly after filming the first cut and wasn't able to film any reshoots. Not that it would've drastically improved the movie, but we'll never know. Still, a must own.",1437004800,23,458,4.597560975609756
7333013,5,B011ID14F2,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the Halloween movies. In high school, a friend showed me a bootleg copy of the Producer's Cut. I could barely see what was going on. Last year, Scream Factory released all the Halloween films together, including this version on blu-ray. It looked beautiful. I still like a few scenes from the theatrical version, but after watching this film a few times, I gotta say it's a much better experience. It has more storyline, more Dr. Loomis, more info about Thorn and why Michael is killing off members of his family. more cult scenes, and made a lot more sense regarding Jamie Lloyd's baby. This review WILL contain spoilers.

Six years after the events of Halloween 5, Michael and Jamie mysteriously vanished. She is pregnant (with Michael's baby. Gross!) and finally manages to escape the cult who kidnapped her. She makes a call to radio DJ, Barry Simms asking for helping. Her plea to help is heard by Dr. Loomis and Tommy Doyle (the boy Laurie Strode was babysitting in the original Halloween) She hides the baby, and is coincidentally found by Tommy at a bus station. He lives across from the Strodes, who are relatives of the family that adopted Laurie, and they happen to live in the Myers house.

Kara Strode has a son named Danny, who is beginning to hear voices from the Man in Black and telling him to kill for Michael. Kara and Danny meet up with Tommy and tells them the secret behind Michael's madness. When Kara and Danny are taken to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, they are to witness Michael Myers' final sacrifice and let Danny become the next to be cursed. Tommy and Dr. Loomis must come to the rescue and try to stop Michael from spreading his curse any further. As I said, this is a much better movie and makes a lot more sense. I'm glad it's finally on blu-ray and being released on its own, so some people don't have to buy the complete collection to get it. I highly recommend HALLOWEEN 6: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS PRODUCER'S CUT!!!",1437004800,24,1986,4.560224089635854
7333014,5,B011ID14F2,"This getting a Stand alone release it's very jarring due to the fact last Fall a boat load of fans
More then likely double dipped to Buy The Halloween: The Complete BR Collection Limited Deluxe
I'm one of those fans (Keep in mind I already had all Original Halloween BR put out by Anchor Bay & Scream Factory
We were told getting the Limited Edition Deluxe Box set was the Only way we'd get a Legit retail Copy
of Halloween 666: The Origin of Michael Myers  (AKA The Producers Cut)
Then a year later this is coming out  Distributed by Lionsgate of all the Indie Companies

UPDATE 7-21-2015
I've went in and edited this review one to many times
just trying to give fans somewhat interesting info

Not sure if Lionsgate acquired  the rights or what It's just very strange a year later

On the hand for those smart enough to not go in Blindly to re-buy The Halloween Films again in a So-Called Limited Box Set
They get the RARE Item everyone over spent on the box set to own without breaking the bank

I just hope this version is bare bones it should be since Both Scream Factory & Anchor bay created all the exclusives Extras for the box set in the first place
The Unrated Producer's Cut is what it is some fans hate it others Love it
It's interesting to say the least the story makes more sense and bookends Halloween 5 and the whole ""Thorn"" Sub plot
The odd Thing About Halloween 6 there are around 4 different Versions of it (My mistake actually 5 versions)
Since in this day and age everyone has to be snarky or a Troll I'll list the various Cuts
1. Halloween 666 The Producer's Cut aka Workprint (Running time 1 hour 36min)
2. Halloween 666 Rough Cut,  (Running time 1 hour 34 minutes)
3. Halloween 6 Director's Cut  (Running time 1 hour 29 minutes)
4. Halloween 6 Television Cut  (Running time 1 hour 31 minutes)
5. Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers  (Theatrical Cut)  (Running time 87 minutes)

This version might be in fact a Mix between the Producer's Cut and The Director's Cut (If done proper could be worth buying for all Halloween Fans)
I wish they did the Bold Choice in Adding the TV Cut (Cause it's a very Unique Cut)
I kind of know the ins and out of This particular film this is the first Halloween i was able to see in the Theater back in '96 or whenever it hit Nation Wide.... Keep in mind there was no Internet (for the general public) Social Media, etc.
It holds a strange special place in my heart for various reasons
Looking back even the Theatrical Cut isn't The Worst like so many love to ""say"" Look at Rob Zombie's Butchering of the Halloween Brand with this lazy unoriginal Concept those two Film s were.
The biggest problem with any reviews or opinions on any Media in General (Books, tv, Film, Art, even video games)
People no longer have integrity everyone is fake and phony (The Hipster way of thinking has bleed into common sense)
If you don't have a Legit Retail version of the Producer's Cut this is really a must have
This being The Producer's Cut is another Story?!
If Lionsgate got the HD Transfer from the box set it'll look pretty good (Not flawless) But, better then any of the bootleg VHS & Dvd's Copies that have been floating around the last 15 years  A True Must buy if you don't have the Box Set (Even without the extras it's so one of those things every horror fan has been dreaming to get a Retail release
I'm pretty sure this is In fact the mash-up between the Producer's Cut & The Director's Cut (That would explain the long running time like another Reviewer brought up!) If it is in fact a (New) Mash-up Cut I Honestly will spend the $10.00 and Buy it due to the fact that would be Brilliant on the  part of Lionsgate and I'm sure even all the fans including myself who bought the deluxe box set will throw there $ down to get this  9.5/10",1436918400,10,3795,4.346534653465347
7333029,5,B011ID14F2,I love the Halloween franchise this movie filled in some wholesale that I was wondering about in the other version like who was Jamie's baby father which didn't make sense to me becuz  I can't see Michael Myers having sex with Jamie to make that baby an him jus standing there in that lil ceremony jus looked add to me he suppose to be this uncontrollable killer and he was jus being submissive in that scene and his mask wasn't tucked in an it looks like he had a pillow or something under his clothes at one point an the ending wasn't all that could've been better I actually love the other version better but overall all its a great movie I jus got it the other day an I've already watched it 8 times and am I the only one that noticed the Dr at the ceremony at the end,1508716800,,772,4.112582781456954

7333034,2,B011ID14F2,"Continues and concludes the Jamie Lloyd trilogy of films. The producers cut offers a supernatural twist and the theatrical version is a more violent traditional slasher. The previous films saw the franchise plummeting to an all time low. Halloween 6, though slightly elevated in quality, doesn't quite make for a satisfying experience. Cults, warlocks and ancient curses shouldnt have anything to do with Michael Myers.",1493942400,,419,5.461538461538462

7333036,5,B011ID14F2,Great I saw this movie in the the theater years ago and this is the theatrical version the regular one that cuts all the parts off is not but I guess most people haven't see it in theatre like I did. For years Ive been waiting for this to come out and am very happy I get to relieve the true movie. Only one part was missing at the beginning I remember. This explains so much the other one they released makes no sense this is the true movie.,1484352000,,442,3.9775280898876404

7333039,4,B011ID14F2,"It's interesting to read such mixed reviews about this movie. That just shows you need to watch this yourself to decide how you feel about it. If you're a fan and have seen the theatrical release, I think it's important to watch this one just to see the different perspective and ending.

What I found most compelling about this version were the subtle differences in many of the scenes, including dialog and sound. I know the theatrical release intimately, and so these differences really stood out. It shows how just the sound of music or effects can greatly impact a scene.

All in all, personally I prefer the theatrical release because of the way the sound and effects were done in that one and also the new ending of this producer's version didn't do much for me, but I'm really glad I own this one too. It's another perspective on a great scary movie!",1478044800,,858,4.564935064935065
7333040,1,B011ID14F2,Avoid this crap.  Its like watching a straight to video black comedy.  The theatrical version is much better.  Nothing interesting happens in this movie the ending is totally anti-climatic.  How this got a high cult following is still something I can't understand.  Still the information over the Thorne appearing when Michael Myers struck was something I did like and it should have been in the theatrical version.,1478044800,,415,5.134328358208955
7333041,5,B011ID14F2,So much better than the theatrical version..I can't believe it took them this long to release the producers cut,1477958400,,111,4.894736842105263
7333042,3,B011ID14F2,"To me, this particular sequel to the Halloween saga has been the best. I did like this version, but it was a little mellow as compared to the superior original with which we're all too familiar. Unlike the theatrical release, it went more in depth on the Curse of Thorn religion which demystified Michael Myers' supernatural abilities and motive behind his madness. Donald Pleasence is irreplaceable as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur was the ideal actor to play the shape. However, I do not recommend Halloween H20 primarily because the Curse of Thorn idea was abandoned and I certainly condemn Rob Zombie's remakes of the classics as Michael Myers was never a part of a white trash family. All in all, I recommend this picture to the ordinary Halloween enthusiast.",1477612800,3,763,4.876923076923077
7333043,5,B011ID14F2,"I for one LOVE Halloween.  And as far as the series of ""slasher"" flicks goes, to me, Halloween outshines the others (Friday the 13th, Freddy, Hellraiser).  Where those really got cheesy with comedy, kills, and just over all bad production, I've loved Halloween for at least trying to stay more on a serious note (Halloween: Resurrection really ends after the 1st 20 minutes.  After Laurie is killed, end of movie in my book.  The rest is pure crap).
So with that said, I can say I enjoy 1,2,4,5, 6, (and H2O, but this diverts from 4,5,6.)  They do tail off from the original story wise (1 and 2), but they at least try to tie them together.
So after reading reviews for the this one (producer's cut) I am on board with this version being better than the original theater version.

This is a better story to explain how things are intertwined together.  Now some acting parts are a bit weak/lame, but this a horror flick on it's 6th story (at the time).  Nothing is perfect.  I noticed a lot of different footage that was used than the original.  And that clears up a lot of ""mess"" that the theater version left confusing.

I feel had they done this one from the get go, they then could have run with MM in a another direction.

So if you are a Halloween fan and enjoy the series, but have not seen this version, I say do it.  It at least helps with over all story.",1477180800,2,1364,4.322834645669292
7333044,5,B011ID14F2,Part 1 & 2 are the best of the best but this follows a close 2nd,1473638400,,64,3.0625
7333045,2,B011ID14F2,"A lot of fans prefer this version over the theatrical version and I don't really understand why.  The ""original"" ending is a better fit theme-wise, but from a horror perspective, I found it completely boring and lacking suspense and tension throughout.  The theatrical ending may have been all over the place, but at least there is a certain level of suspense and Michael has much more interaction with the main characters.  Leading up to the ending, though, the small added scenes and use of the original music gives this a more genuine ""Halloween"" feel - its just the ending that ruins it for me.  It is nice to have in the collection, though.

As a side note, this disc is different from the one included in the Limited Edition Complete Collection.  This pressing is bare bones - It lacks all of the special features from that edition, losing the terrific commentary track and interviews.  So for those who think they may have gotten ripped off since it was originally stated that the PC would only be available in that set, rest easy - you still have the superior version.",1471219200,,1076,4.661375661375661
7333046,1,B011ID14F2,"John Carpenter's Halloween is the greatest horror film ever made and was followed by the excellent Halloween 2. Unfortunately after the failure of the terrible part 3 Carpenter's original concept of doing a Halloween anthology series with a different Halloween themed story every October never happened but we did get the very strong Halloween 4. After that I don't know what the hell happened with this series. I always heard great things about this producer's cut but it's just as laughably bad as the theatrical version. Very embarrassing. On the plus side parts 1, 2 and 4 make for an outstanding trilogy with the ending of part 4 closing off the trilogy perfectly just as the original intended to end.",1470787200,,706,4.891666666666667
7333047,3,B011ID14F2,"This price is right, I think it's a waste of money for the extra footage. This is my favorite Halloween besides the first one. I did not like the added scenes. It made more sense but I am so used to the original version.",1469836800,,220,4.0227272727272725
7333048,5,B011ID14F2,This Version of Halloween 6 reminds me so much of why I loved the first two films so much. I hated the original version of this film. They tried to make it too much like scream and other dimension horror films and I think it hurt this film badly. This version has such a feel to it that reminds me of the first two films and really does kind of give you that eerie feeling of the Halloween season. This is the way the film was meant to be seen and I will never watch the theatrical version ever again. Kudos to Dimension films for doing the right thing and finally releasing this original version. By the way some people complained about little things like the fact that there are some music miscues and some editing ones as well but I really didn't notice it much myself. Also the Brother Cane song Fools shine On is not anywhere in this version. That was added later to the theatrical cut another studio decision. Although I do like the song I don't really miss it here. This is true Halloween all the way!,1468627200,4,1008,4.282722513089006

7333050,4,B011ID14F2,"The film is certainly a great addition to the Halloween franchise that enriches the same film presented twenty years ago. Character development is expanded, and the music is different in certain scenes to heighten suspense similar to the first Halloween film. However....there are a few problems with this cut...in my opinion. The producers cut takes away the edge and grittiness from the theatrical cut. The original music is part of what gave the film it's edge along with the quick pacing of some scenes. The violence has been somewhat toned down in this one, and if you have seen the theatrical cut then you will recognize it. Certain elements of the theatrical cut made the film into a fun horror film of the 90s, which seems to anger some fans. In all fairness, both cuts can be appreciated in their own ways, and what is great about the producer's cut is seeing it on Blu ray.",1467504000,,883,4.666666666666667

7333067,4,B011ID14F2,"At long last, the unrated producer's cut of 'Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers' has reached a Blu-Ray/DVD audience. For fans of the original 'Halloween' franchise, it has been a long time coming.

From what I had seen on various message boards talk existed of a Producer's Cut that contained several alternate & additional minutes that told the story of Michael Myers' origins and the evil 'Thorn' curse that drove him on his unholy mission through 5 films. This one does not disappoint. It is far superior to the original version in more ways than one, including the fact that many additional scenes with Dr. Loomis (the late, great Donald Pleasance, in his last film role before his death) and Dr. Wynn (Mitchell Ryan of 'Lethal Weapon 1' and 'Magnum Force'), which shed some light on the mysterious 'Thorn'; Jamie's alternate fate; and additional scenes with the arrogant broadcaster as well as an alternate fate for the bullying patriarch, John Strode.

I'm not sure how much length this producers' cut adds to the film but it appears to be at least 5-10 minutes. The only disappointment I have is that I cannot access the digital copy, which I am trying to fix. Aside from that, this is something well worth picking up, especially for fans of the original 'Halloween' franchise.",1449705600,,1289,4.828054298642534

7333124,2,B011ID14F2,"Halloween VI: The Curse of Michael Myers Producer's Cut is a strange beast. Apparently there were a lot of internal conflicts during the making of this film and it really shows in this version. Even though this is dubbed ""the Producers Cut"", I wouldn't really say that it is better than the original version because this film is plagued with issues. If we are following the Halloween story (which has never been one for continuity except for the first two films), this is suppose to take place 6 years after the events of Halloween 5, however, we are introduced to a Jamie who is much older than she is suppose to be. (This was an absolute terrible recast, she is suppose to be 15 in this film and the actress who portrays her looks like she is in her 30s). Despite plot holes galore and a bad story, the first two thirds of this film are actually not bad at all. However, once when we start getting towards the end of the run time, things take a turn for the worse and this is where this film differs drastically from the original version. A seemingly different ending altogether, it gives us one of the worst endings in Halloween franchise history. The ending is sooooo bad that it actually makes the Producer's Cut inferior to the original version. However, this version did add some good things and one of the pluses is that they replaced all of the terrible new age Halloween rock music from the original with Halloween's original score which is a real treat. That being said, the alternate scenes in this film are not that great and and most of the time they are quite inferior to the scenes from the original. There are tons of scene changes, some minor, some drastic and I have listed the main ones below.

Warning! Spoilers

List of main changes in the producers cut:

-During the opening credits it is narrated by Dr. Loomis (I actually like this change a lot)
-Jaime doesn't get killed in the barn, instead she dies later in the hospital (I hate this change because in the original how she died was so freaking brutal)
-All of the music has been replaced with actual Halloween music (Love this change, because the music in the original version was some really bad rock music)
-The last 20 minutes of the film are completely different and in a bad way. The ending is laughable- it will make people scratch their heads wondering what the hell happened. (The last 20 minutes in the original was far superior to the Producer's Cut version. This ending is really bad and if it wasn't for this ending, it would actually be a decent film altogether. Can't say how much I hated this ending)
-This version of the film is overall a lot more supernatural than the original version (Some of the supernatural aspects are just plain stupid)

Most of the movie is watchable until the last 20 minutes or so when it goes from decent to abysmal in a matter of minutes. If you are somewhat of a fan of the Halloween movies you will like this film at best, but die hard fans will immediately notice all of the issues and some are just too hard to dismiss.

I'd give this particular version a 2 out of 5 while I would give the original a 3.5 out of 5. (If it wasn't for the bad ending I would give it a 3 out of 5) Maybe one day we will get a Director's Cut  that will mash the best parts from both versions to get an actual good movie, but until that happens, the original version is superior.

Pros:
+ Surprisingly good cinematography
+Mask has improved drastically since Halloween 4 and 5 (I like the this mask a lot, but can't we set a mask standard here people?)
+Return of the great and creepy Halloween music
+Dr. Loomis gets more screen time
+Some nostalgic moments that give nods to the original

Cons:
-Severe plot holes, some are really bad
-Laughable story
-Mostly bad acting except for a few standout performances
-Terrible ending
-Weak characters
-Some alternate scenes are worse than their original counterpart",1446854400,,3915,4.504225352112676

The series just seemed to get worse the more it went on. Was never really thrilled with the actors casted for Michael Myers. And please don't get me started on the stupid masks used throughout as well. The original mask is the only one that works. Just my opinion. Anyways, with that being said, this is the only one I can somewhat get behind. While this Unrated Producer's Cut does seem to flow better than the theatrical version, there are parts missing that I wish would have remained, one of which being Myers slaughtering the doctors and nurses in the hospital towards the end of the film, and his pursuit of one in which he breaks down a door using the poor bastard. Although I am glad the ending is different. This was also Donald Pleasence's final performance of Dr. Loomis, which he always played so well. That alone may sway naysayers of the movie to own it. Depends on the fan I guess. So, if you enjoy all the other Halloween movies, then you will for sure enjoy this one. If you're only a fan of the original two, then you might want to pass on this.

Michael took a backseat it seemed to the ritual story ideas and it didn't really fit well to me with his regular path of action on a whole. This does seem like a cleaned up movie from what I remember. It was funny seeing Paul Rudd in a satanic robe and Michael standing there staring at the ritual like a willing participant. Seeing Loomis at home relaxing with a wall of liquor and books was something we never saw either in the series so that was a nice addition. Michael's chest looked puffy again like he had a pillow in his jumpsuit, not sure why they chose to do this, he looked lumpy.

7333144,4,B011ID14F2,"Halloween VI is pretty legendary for being rubbish, and with good reason.  After the film was complete, the studio demanded re-shoots and story changes.  Since Donald Pleasance had passed away in the meantime, the filmmakers had to get really creative editing his scenes into the new version of the film, and what made it to theaters wasn't just bad, it barely made sense.

The long-awaited release of the ""Producer's Cut"" seeks to finally put all of this to rest by giving us something far closer to the original intended version of the film.  So what's the verdict?  Well, the Producer's Cut is a far superior version, but  the changes, (reversions, I suppose) though appreciated, can only go so far.  Without getting into spoilers, I think what most people will notice very quickly is that the Producer's Cut is much less graphically violent and proceeds at a slower pace than the theatrical version.  Donald Pleasence gets much more screen time, and overall the film feels like it's trying to be more of a thriller than a horror flick.  In general, it works pretty well.  It's worth noting that even though the running time of the Producer's Cut is only 8 minutes longer than the theatrical version, vast swaths of the film are at least subtly different, sometimes drastically so. The last 20 minutes of the movie are almost totally different from the theatrical version, and it's really here that we see the most dramatic improvement.  The ending is likely to be a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but it's far less disjointed than the theatrical cut.

The principal sin of Halloween VI in general is that it tries to retroactively add a ton of backstory to Michael Myers, and the Producer's Cut doesn't change this - indeed, it actually gives more backstory.  However, because the Producer's Cut is willing to take a little more time with things, it actually pulls this off a little better than the theatrical version.  It's still pretty silly, but it's easier to follow at least.

One relatively minor thing that was still striking to me is how much brighter this version of the film is.  I have an older DVD release of the theatrical version, and the Producer's Cut is FAR brighter and easier to see.  Overall, this movie is worth a look for completionist Halloween fans.  It's easily better than the theatrical cut, but in the end it's still Halloween VI.",1445558400,10,2358,4.80893300248139

7333146,4,B011ID14F2,"Forget everything you thought you knew about Michael Myers.  Apparently, it was an ancient Celtic curse that drove Michael to kill his family (and everyone else who got in his way).  Some weird mumbo jumbo linked with Thorn, a constellation and a nifty tattoo/calling card of this mysterious cult led by the man in black, or, as I prefer to call him, boot man (because you only get to see his boots until the BIG reveal).  In this alternate universe, Myers and Jamie Lloyd were kidnapped by a cult and held captive for years.  Jamie was impregnated and gave birth to the spawn of Michael.  With an able assist, she and her baby manage to escape with Michael in hot pursuit.  Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle (Paul Stephen Rudd) from the first movie is now an adult voyeur spying on the newest version of the Myers house.  Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is also on hand, waiting for Michael to return home.  And just like the three bears, Michael does not like having other people living in his house!

This is the first time I've seen this ""special"" version of The Curse of Michael Myers.  It was................interesting.  I didn't quite understand the need to reimagine the story to the point where it's almost unrecognizable.  Cooking up another reason for why Michael was an unstoppable killing machine lessens the impact of his malevolence.

I liked the way it added more to the story regarding the ""Thorn"" elements but it also cut quite a few good scenes. For instance the scene where Michael grabs the big Knife and goes into the surgical room and just rages out is cut?  IMO that is one of the best Halloween murder scenes in the whole series. I also prefer the ending of theatrical version to this one. That being said for any Halloween fan who hasn't seen this you have to check it out.

7333170,3,B011ID14F2,"The troubled production of ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" -- the sixth installment in the undying ""Halloween"" franchise -- is a well-documented one. From meddling producers and an apathetic director to a well-meaning but ultimately befuddling script and actors who seem lost in the mix, it's safe to say that this production was, indeed, cursed. Perhaps in an alternate universe, we would have gotten that Quentin Tarantino-helmed sequel we were teased, with Howard Stern on board as the shock-jock (yes people, that was actually a thing. Look it up!) but in the end we have to settle for what we were given.

The film was originally released in a heavily condensed and edited version that shed much of the film's original plot in favor for gore and a tighter pace. But there was more to the film, as this newly restored Producer's Cut reveals. Though still a somewhat head-scratching ordeal (including an ending that lands with a flat thud), it fleshes out the original plot in more detailed fashion and slows down to build up some Carpenter-esque ambience (well, almost) and replaces the guitar-twang of the theatrical score with a more faithful and classic rendition of the iconic score.

Set six years after Halloween 5 (a disappointing affair unto itself), Dr. Loomis (the indispensable Donald Pleasence) comes back for one last go-round (Pleasence passed away during the film's production) against The Shape. This time, he has the assistance of none other than Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd, yes, *that* Paul Rudd), the little boy being babysat by Laurie Strode in the original who is now a creepy loner hellbent on unraveling the mystery of what drives Michael Myers. It turns out there's a cult using Michael as a sacrifice to the gods. He must eliminate his family lineage in order to prevent famine. Really, it's just an excuse to get some blood flowing through the streets of Haddonfield, but beware: this version of the film features a lot less gore than the theatrical version (and is actually the better for it).

Just as you should always temper your expectations when taking in the sixth installment of any franchise, so should you with the release of this Blu-Ray. While the picture is about as you'd expect a half-hearted Weinstein production from the mid-'90s to look in HD, the disc itself is a strictly bare-bones release. No featurettes, no trailer, no nothing. If you're looking to quench that thirst, the Scream! Factory set released last year is for you (provided you are in the mood to drop a good chunk of change). This release is strictly for those of us who have bought this series enough times already and can't be bothered to plunk down for a massive set of stuff we already owned three times over (with the added benefit of some new material sprinkled throughout). But given the price and the respectful presentation, you can hardly fault Lions Gates for keeping things simple with this release. Just know what you're getting into.

In reality, ""Halloween 6,"" or ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" or ""Halloween 666"" (whatever you call it) never stood a chance of being a game-changer nor did it ever have any hopes of living up to the John Carpenter classic from 1978. What Halloween 6 has to offer is a somewhat muddled if not somewhat intriguing take on what was, even by 1995, a pretty run-down and tired mythology. After the disappointing release of this installment, the series took a drastic turn in luring Jamie Lee Curtis back to franchise for the insipidly titled but admittedly more satisfying ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,"" thus ignoring and negating the events of this film (and the two before it). The legacy of ""Halloween 6"" is a lesson in what to do and what not to do in horror sequels and one of the more interesting examples of a studio shooting itself in the foot. While the old saying that ""you can't polish a turd"" rings somewhat true, the Producer's Cut remains a fascinating watch just the same.",1444608000,,3960,4.836283185840708

So I have seen the theatrical release several times and while it is not a great movie it is an okay way to kill an hour and a half. I can definitely see why the theatrical version was released the way it was although there is no cohesion to the story. it was to be a straight up slasher film focusing on Michael myers and his bloodletting. The Producers Cut is a completely different film and the kills are few and far between and they are not very graphic and Michael is not in the movie very much at all. It could have very much have been an episode of Greys anatomy it is pretty boring. They focus more on Doctor Loomis' relationship with Michael Myers, the Thorn Cult and Tommy Doyle taking care of a Gerber Baby with a bloody thorn symbol on its chest. It is also a let down that there is no real final confrontation. The finale still takes place at Smith's Grove but instead of aborted fetus expirements, a room full of doctors getting slayed and Michael getting used and abused by Paul Rudd and a pipe we get....Michael being stopped dead in his tracks buy runestones thrown on the ground and Tommy saying ""Samhain"". Michael just simply....stops. No further action needed to take down this seemingly unkillable killing machine. *SPOILER ALERT* With Myers immobilized Tommy, the chic and Michael's offspring drive off into the night while Loomis says he has unfinished business and returns inside the hospital to confront Myers now lying on the ground. when the mask is removed it is actually Dr. Wynn and he passes the Thorn Symbol on to Dr. Loomis who is not only horrified but is also now the custodian of Michael. I will say after waiting all these eons to finally see this version in a crisp, clean copy I was very let down. I liked the supernatural angle but it was just too talky and slow for a slasher film. I wanted to see Michael taken down, I wanted the genetic thorn experimentation with the fetus' in that glowing green substance further investigated. I wanted more Mikey Myers. A lot of people say this movie is far superior than the theatrical release but I think the fact that this Producers Cut has been so hard to get for all this time that people are seeing it through rose colored glasses.

7333181,4,B011ID14F2,"I remember seeing this in theatres 20 years ago and being so disappointed with the end result considering the cliffhanger left 6 years prior in Halloween 5. As most already know this film suffered from studio interference much like Alien 3 which several years back received an alternate 'Assembly Cut' and much like the Producers Cut of Halloween 6 seems to be the first choice amongst fans. It's amazing how these alternate versions can completely change a viewers perspective 180.

In H6 PC, there is more emphasis placed on suspense than gory violent kills (my preference although a good portion of fans seem to prefer bloody kills and over the top violence). This feels like a true Halloween film, shot in Salt Lake City like Halloween 4/5 and has a cold, grey, depressing feel about it. Michael lurks in the background and in the shadows, stalking his prey before he strikes. The music soundtrack sounds the same as the first film and not altered to make it more hip and modern (like in theatrical cut and H20). George P Wilbur portrays Michael (aka The Shape) and he has always been a favorite of mine (he also portrayed Michael in H4). The mask looks great and scary (imo it took a turn for the worse in H20).

Character development is more prominent in this version as well. We get more Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis which is a plus, and even little scenes like John and Debra Strode talking about their daughter Kara makes the characters more layered and human. Paul Rudd as Tommy Doyle seems to be taking over the Loomis role as he has fixated on Michael Myers to the point of becoming obsessed. Marianne Hagan as Kara Strode assumes the likeable leading female role and does a serviceable job in the part. However much like Friday the 13th VI, Jason Lives, the female lead takes a back seat to the male lead as this is Tommy's battle to fight.

Most importantly about H6 Producer's Cut is that the story is more fluid and not full of gaping plot holes as in the theatrical cut. The Thorn/cult angle is on full display and you are not left scratching your head with more questions than answers. Writer Daniel Farrands did a swell job creating a movie with an actual plot and that still felt like a Halloween film full of atmosphere and suspense (and being the fourth Michael Myers sequel). Although the character of Jamie Lloyd had a sad ending, I preferred her end in this one rather than the horrific one in the theatrical cut. It's a shame she couldn't have been featured as more of a leading character in this one.

I've noticed that the Halloween franchise has been divided into Laurie's trilogy (Halloween 1, 2 and H20) and her daughter Jamie's trilogy (Halloween 4, 5 and 6.). Although Jamie does not feature heavily in Halloween 6. Halloween 8 (Resurrection) is pretty much an abomination in the eyes of fans and most pretend it doesn't exist. Without leads like Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance, it really has lost its luster. Halloween 6 feels like the last real Halloween film although it answers the questions posed in H5 and makes a smooth transition into Halloween H20.

H6 PC is a worthy addition to the franchise and should sit proudly on your horror shelf. Sadly I could not say the same about the theatrical cut.
Another film that suffered from studio interference around the same time was Hush with Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow. I've been advocating to Scream Factory to release a director's cut as the reshoots of that film left many plot holes and an altogether unsatisfying film. If you watch the trailer you'll see how much exciting action and suspense that was cut out.

Let's keep supporting these alternate versions that the studios feel the need to butcher. Ultimately we get to decide what we want to see rather than the studio who usually only have dollars and misconceptions on their mind.",1442534400,39,3844,4.670605612998523
7333182,4,B011ID14F2,"Among horror fans, the Producer's Cut of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers has always been something of a legend; a mythical relic from the history of one of horror's most prestigious film series that few are aware exists, and even fewer still have seen in its entirety. The Producer's Cut, for those unaware, is an alternate cut of ""The Curse of Michael Myers,"" the sixth entry in the popular Halloween series, and one which delves into the supernatural side of the origin of villain Michael Myers, and which also attempts to make sense of the series' incredibly convoluted internal mythology.

However, as tends to happen frequently in Hollywood, a lot of behind-the-scenes drama caused many scenes to be re-shot and the entire film re-edited. Much of the original version of the film was tossed out, and the theatrically released film has been the version most widely available on home video for twenty years, while the original version of the film, dubbed in intervening years as the ""Producer's Cut,"" became nothing but a footnote in the franchise's storied history.

But eventually, the cut footage surfaced in low-quality bootlegs that made the rounds for years before finally getting an official, though limited, Blu-Ray release. Now, this legendary ""lost"" version of the film is finally widely available for fans to view and enjoy. And, frankly, the movie is a bit underwhelming.

The movie runs at 96 minutes as opposed to the 88 minute theatrical version. But there is much more to this version than a seemingly meager 8 additional minutes; much of this version of the film is constructed using alternate takes and scenes, as well as an entirely new third act! The bulk of the new material fleshes out the supernatural origin of Myers, a subplot that was reduced to a series of throwaway lines in the theatrical cut. Many plot holes are filled in with the additional scenes, tying up to several plot threads present in the theatrical film, but which were never paid off. There is so much new stuff here that this Blu-Ray, despite being barebones, is a must own for any fan or the series! However, there is one major drawback: the film is actually complete crap.

Before you die-hard fans take up your pitchforks and crucify me, let me explain: I love this film. ""Curse"" is my favorite of all the Halloween films because of this Producer's Cut; the subplot with the Cult of Thorn and the explanation of the ""curse"" add something to this film that makes it stand out among the other entries of the series. However, as presented on this disc, the film is awkwardly edited and plays out in a very choppy manner; scenes end abruptly with no resolution, and there are some music cues that feel incredibly out of place (the first scene at the college is a prime example; why is there scary music playing during a totally not-scary scene?), or scenes that are missing music cues entirely. And some of the new scenes don't fit with the flow of the film; it's almost like the editor got lazy and simply spliced the scenes into the movie with no effort to restructure the scene around it, resulting in a movie that feels choppy and unfinished. Between the theatrical version and the Producer's Cut, there is a brilliant movie hidden here somewhere, and in the hands of a more capable editor, I feel like that film can be brought out bright and shining.

On another positive note, however, the film looks amazing from a visual perspective. The video is a new 1080p HD transfer, taken from the Scream Factory boxed set of the entire series released last year, which was the first official release of this cut. Compared to the previously available bootlegs of the movie, which were all fuzzy, VHS-quality picture and sound, the difference is night and day. All the video ""dirt"" has been cleaned up, and the film looks spectacular and crisp. The audio is 5.1 HD and crystal clear, as opposed to the bootlegs where the audio was spotty at best, and constantly faded in and out to the point of being unintelligible.

There is nothing here making it worth the double-dip for those that purchased the boxed set last year, unless you think the (in my personal opinion) kick-ass box art is worth $10. But for those who consider themselves Halloween fans that haven't seen this version of the movie (and don't feel like forking out $150 for the boxed set), this is a must-own for their collection. Even casual fans, or those that like horror in general, should check it out, as the alternate scenes make this movie worth the watch, even if it's not that great.",1442448000,2,4553,4.742424242424242

An amazing bare bones deal. Especially if you had bought all the Halloween Blu Rays separately throughout the years and didn't want to spend $100 on the Blu Ray set just to get H6 Producers Cut, which is easily found on the super information highway.

7333188,1,B011ID14F2,"This new Halloween 6 Producers cut blu-ray is by Lionsgate not scream factory
apparently Lionsgate were missing out on the big sales scream factory
 were getting from selling the new producers cut version
so Lionsgate decided to release their own blu-ray version
i did some looking on the internet to find out if this new Lionsgate blu-ray will have any new extras
and i found out it will be just a barebones blu-ray release
what a surprise,well i'm not surprised at all
it's typical of Lionsgate to make no effort for a new blu-ray version
and just release the film as stand alone release with no special features
so disregard this lionsgate blu-ray
and still get the Scream factory blu-ray
about the film itself first, well obviously the Producers cut version is the better version of the film No Doubt about it
the storyline makes sense in the Producers cut where is the story/plot was confusing in the Theatrical cut
alot of scenes made no sense in the Theatrical version,it was a pathetic version of H6
the producers cut 95mins has all new different scenes that the Theatrical version does not have
but still has some scenes from the Theatrical cut to tie in with the storyline
everytime i watch H6 i watch the Producers cut now of course and i have no regrets

the scream factory version has lots & lots of new special features, over 1hours worth of new extras
new interview with Danielle Harris, new interviews with producer Malek Akkad & Producer Paul freeman
new interviews with some of the cast from the film
new interviews with the special make up effects team led by John Beauchler
and lots of behind the scenes footage,and other Alternate scenes/Outtakes
plus lots more extras
an incredible Job by scream factory
plus an incredible looking HD transfer, very sharp & clear picture quality for sure
for a version of Halloween 6 that is only now officially released plus a new 5.1 master audio mix added to it
the scream factory blu-ray is the version to get for sure
but the negative thing about this version is it's not available seperatly
as far as i know it's only available in the Halloween blu-ray collection box set
unless someone is selling the blu-ray seperatly on Ebay i think that's the only way to get a copy is on Ebay
if you want all the special features of course
but if your not fussy then get the Lionsgate blu-ray just to check out the Producers cut version i guess
up to you your Decision
5 stars for the new producers cut of course, 5 stars for the scream factory blu-ray version
and 1 star for this Lionsgate blu-ray based on no extras",1440460800,6,2566,4.600436681222708

I actually got the box set last year and watched the producers cut before having ever seen the theatrical. It was a little bit all over the place with the cult scenes, but it was pretty good. I went back and watched the theatrical cut a few weeks later and was very disappointed. All of the new scenes in the hospital and the final battle at the end were just stupid. They had their mid 90s effects and green glow and it was just dumb. I would highly recommend picking up this version if you're a fan of the boogeyman!",1439510400,2,592,4.247787610619469

I bought the box set and wasn't impressed with this new cut or even the theatrical cut when I saw it opening night in theaters.  The story is ridiculous and it should be wiped from our Halloween memories.  Even Paul Rudd stated on his Howard Stern interview for ""Antman"" said that this movie is just god awful.  Probably explains why he didn't do any interviews for the behind the scenes featurettes.  This release is a bare bones release as well.  That is another reason to not get this Blu-ray.  At least the box set version had a lot of behind the scene stuff.  One interesting story about this disaster is the story of how Danielle Harris got the shaft on being a part of the film.  Her interview is on a behind the scene feature from the Scream Factory box set and she sets the record straight on why she wasn't in the film.  Also, she did not like the story of the movie either.  The only enjoyable thing in this movie is seeing Donald Pleasance's final role on film, hence the 2 star rating.  I recommend that you save your money, time and get a better Halloween movie.

I love the Producer's cut. I didn't like the theatrical version of the film. Michael Myers is back and the end with Loomis receiving the mark of THORN was a surprise twist.  I wish Donald Pleasance had lived to make one or two more films.  The Halloween series was flawed three times in the past by Halloween III- Season of the Witch with that annoying commerical durning the movie. I was glad when Halloween 3 was over. I hated the Rob Zombie versions of Halloween because the violence was excessive and over the top, SKIP THE THEATRICAL VERSION OF THE FILM.

This movie is the last great film in the series. This movie is underrated and underappreciated. Donald Pleasance made these films. He was the driving force behind Halloween and his chemistry with Jamie Lee Curtis in the first two films was amazing.
