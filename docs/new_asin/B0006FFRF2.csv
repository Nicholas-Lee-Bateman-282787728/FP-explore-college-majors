The little stories are nice and thoughtful but I find them a little corny and a little too simple.  Each episode teaches a good life lesson but like I said maybe a little too simplistic for some.",1376697600,,292,4.290909090909091
8041230,5,B0006FFRF2,"There is no action, 3D effect in this anime. But the stories and the careful description of the charaters and their behaviors are worth of viewing. The pace might be slow because there is no action. Meanwhile, you will find it very interesting and reflection of the society we live in. This is the first volumn I bought. I continued to purchase the other volumns.",1172534400,5,363,4.6
