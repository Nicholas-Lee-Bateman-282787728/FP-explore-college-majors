About the musical execution, I have two (small) regrets :

(1) the various parts follow each other too closely ; in my view, there should be some ""breathing intervals"", as was the case in the first version I ever heard (Hermann Scherchen's)  eons ago as a kid, a version which must have been some twenty minutes longer, although this was also due to some very very slow tempi.

(2) I persist in thinking that the harpsichord and its pearly sound is a better instrument to accompany the evangelist than the organ. This was the case in the older executions I listened to some 50 years ago.

A small note : in my opinion the best evangelist ever was Hughes Cunod. Does anyone concur ?

PS. Sorry for the poor English : my mother tongue is French (or Swiss French).",1399161600,6,1019,4.481081081081081
8563019,5,B00B5UBHBK,"A beautiful, sensitive, reverent performance. Fischer allows Bach to speak with no unnecessary flourishes. Padmore as the Evangelist is superb, and the other soloists and choirs are near perfect. And of course the Concertgebouw orchestral musicians are absolutely first class. The best Matthus Passion I've heard. HP",1380067200,7,316,5.74468085106383
