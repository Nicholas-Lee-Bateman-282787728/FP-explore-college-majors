3645779,5,B001HZ4K76,"This workout is awesome. It uses both cardio and weights to create a low-to-high intensity workout. I started out doing everything Violet did, which is ""normal"" intensity - however, if you are not in the best shape (like myself) I would recommend doing the ""low"" intensity version (follow the woman on the right side of the screen) for a while and work your way up. That way you can make it through the whole 50 minutes! I also love her personality - she's not annoying and safety comes first for her, so you know you're not going to injure yourself. All-in-all this dvd is great.",1236124800,2,580,4.533333333333333
3645780,5,B001HZ4K76,"I HIGHLY recommend this DVD workout.  She is a great trainer - easy to follow and has such great variety of both cardio and sculpting exercises along with great warm ups and cool downs.  She has some kick boxing moves, lunges, yoga moves, etc.  She kicks your butt (literally as thighs and different areas feel the burn) so that you know you worked out but at the same time it is doable.  She has two other people in the video with her and if you are NEW to exercise / just starting out or limited, there is one lady for that group to follow that does lower impact / easier moves.  I love also that depending on how much time you have you can choose different segments -- do 20 mins., 30 mins., or I think the whole thing is around 55 mins. or so.  I just got this and I'm new to it - but LOVEEE it.  Very well laid out - highly recommend.  You'll be glad you got this one!  It's every bit as challenging as the one Jillian Michaels I have.  They are BOTH great but I actually like this ladies style a little more.",1235952000,11,1014,4.075757575757576
3645781,4,B001HZ4K76,"This DVD gives you two different workouts that really get you moving.  I feel like I get a complete body workout in just 34 minutes.  I alternate them so I don't get bored and keeps me on my toes.  Violet Zaki is a pro in teaching-she's easy to understand, gives an explanation of what and why the exercise is important.",1234828800,4,320,4.3
3645782,5,B001HZ4K76,"I like to work out.  I like to be challenged. But I can't stand hearing 'you can do it' being droned into my head over and over again. I'm an adult. I'm either gonna do it or I'm not...regardless of how over the top the expert is.  So.....after 400 gazillion various workout dvd's in my collection I have to say that since I can't do Jazzercize live anymore, I'm pretty picky about my workout.  So, other than Cardio Balanceball with Tanja, this one is my favorites because: it's a great core workout (of which we all need..am I right, ladies??); there are no wasted minutes (you should really choose the whole workout which includes the warm up and cool down sections; no monotonous moves; the music is a bit on the cheesey side but after the first workout I stopped listening because she totally motivated me with her tiny, hard body, I'm not 25 and perfect, 'just get on with it' self; and her workouts offer and illustrate low cardio/impact alternatives for anyone who needs it or is just starting out. I ALWAYS read reviews before buying ANYTHING ANYWHERE.  This is a very good dvd~especially the full sculpting workout ~ challenge yourself!  I'm 48 yrs. old and do the sculpting workout plus the ab workout and I'm done and in the shower within an hour and feel darn good and proud of my sassy self!!  Enjoy!  Hope this was helpful!",1234742400,19,1338,4.55
3645783,5,B001HZ4K76,"I bought this DVD 2 weeks ago and I'm glad I did. The workout is pretty time efficient, so you get to do a whole lot in a short time AND you get your cardio in (I hate the treadmill). Violet 's style is straightforward and her ceuing is excellent. I will be looking for her othe videos.",1233532800,2,286,3.9482758620689653
3645784,5,B001HZ4K76,"Violet Zaki is infectious!  I spent the last 15 years buying workout DVDs only to have them collect dust while I sat on the couch and watched television.  Until someone suggested that I get a DVD taught by Violet Zaki - then everything changed. She has the most amazing energy, and although extremely challenging, her DVDs make you want to finish each workout and never give up.  I always find time to complete my workout, even if I don't do both 20 minute workouts in one sitting.  Some days I do them both at once, other days I will do one in the morning and one before I go to sleep, and sometimes I can only find time to complete 1 portion of the DVD in a day.  However I can fit it in, I make sure I complete both 20 minute workouts 4-5 times per week.  The combination of cardio and scuplt really gives you a completely balanced workout.  I have seen major changes to my body since I have started working out to Violet Zaki DVDs, and Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt is just the newest (and quite possibly my favorite) edition to my collection.  If you already work out, I would definitely recommend adding Cardio Sculpt to your routine.  If you don't work out, this DVD would be an amazing introduction to the fitness world.  You will have fun during your workout, feel so good about yourself afterwards, and see results.  I don't know what I would do without Violet Zaki's workouts!",1233014400,39,1383,4.405511811023622
3645785,5,B001HZ4K76,"I was so excited to discover a new DVD from Violet Zaki!  I have a few DVDs from other instructors, but I always get bored of them and pull out my Violet DVDs.  And now I have a new one to cycle through my ""Old Standbys!""

There is something about Violet's personality and routines that are the perfect balance of difficulty, motivation, and fun.  And I love her accent!  My husband always knows when I did a Violet workout because I start speaking with an Australian accent.  (He thinks it's cute!)

This new DVD came out just in time since I've gotten much busier at work and picked up a hefty travel schedule.  Because this DVD mixes cardio and sculpt, it makes me feel like I've gotten a complete workout in such a short time.  I used to have to use one DVD for a good cardio workout and another one for a sculpting workout.  Combining them in a workout on one DVD is so much more efficient!

Violet, if you read these reviews, thanks for another great DVD!  And keep them coming!  One day, I hope to come to New York and find out how to take one of your classes, so I can have the pleasure of getting my butt kicked by you in person!",1232668800,8,1138,4.188940092165899
3645786,5,B001HZ4K76,"Love it...will enjoy a long shelf life in my streamlined DVD workout collection, making for high returns on the price and my efforts to exercise.

First, I'm a big fan of Violet Zaki, following her innovative workouts on Exercise TV and in her Self DVD's, though this may be her best to date.  She's personable while still economical with her commentary and helpful in her instruction...so encouraging but ""gets down to business"" without the annoying fluff talk other instructors too often overuse.  I'm actually inspired to work hard and not let her down, as if I'm in her class, which proves more motivational when I travel and workout in my hotel room (the chaptering is very functional in this regard too, when short on time).

Second, as advertised, it's an efficient, dynamic workout, full of multi-tasking exercises that challenge more than one muscle group at a time, along with balance and coordination, intensifying calorie burn.  Yet, I think it's still accessible to all fitness levels given the modifications.  I plan on working my way up the intensity curve by increasing poundage on the hand weights (probably substituting straps when I travel), range of movement, and pacing.  IMO, good DVD workouts are challenging but structured so that the user can build on them, extending their usefulness, which Violet inherently seems aware of in how she designed this workout.

Violet's website suggests ""Cardio Kick,"" also from Acacia, will soon be out too...can't wait!",1232323200,20,1478,5.1037344398340245
3645787,5,B001HZ4K76,"Violet Zaki is one of my favorite video instructors and she really hit this one out of the park. The workouts are fun and innovative. I love that she switches up the cardio and doesn't repeat the same intervals over and over. It keeps the workout exciting and doesn't allow you to drift off.

In addition to the great workouts, the chaptering is fantastic. You have the choice of doing everything (warm up, both routines and cool down), or you can pick just one workout, or you can pick either workout with warm up and cool down. The options are already broken out for you so there's no fiddling around to program your set.

Each routine includes strength with cardio intervals and she uses combination moves for double duty effect. Some of these moves are more on the intermediate/advanced side and require good balance, but there is a background exerciser who uses modifications throughout so even someone relatively new to exercise should be able to follow along. I love the yoga-influenced cool down; it's 9 wonderful minutes of stretching and letting go. (Note: The cardio sculpt workouts are about 20 minutes long so adding the warm up and cool down make for a longer, approx. 30 minute, workout.)

There's also a bonus abs routine. Again, she doesn't disappoint. It's around 8 minutes and includes some (optional) weighted work as well as toe dips (a personal favorite) and ends with a nice little stretch. Included with the bonus features is a 5-minute preview of the Weight Loss Pilates workout. It's probably one of the most useful previews I've come across as it makes a nice little add-on to the abs.

Zaki manages to be tough but encouraging. Her warmth and personality really shine through and, IMO, she is unmatched at creating challenging, yet doable, workouts.",1231718400,69,1777,4.8355263157894735
3645788,5,B001HZ4K76,"Such a great workout.  I love the combination of cardio and sculpting, it makes for a fun workout that never gets boring. I love that it's 2--twenty minute workouts where if I have time I'll do both and if I don't I know I can get a great cardio and strenght training workout in just 20 minutes!!
And Violet is just amazing!! positive, energetic and super supportive--she just keeps you motivated throughout the whole workout.",1231372800,9,426,4.68

3645806,5,B001HZ4K76,"I picked this up at a local store and I am so thankful I did. My comprehension skills are quite low and this is the first work out dvd I've found that goes slow enough for me to pick up on while burning calories. With so many customizations on just how I want to work out, I foresee me using this dvd long into the future. This is perfect if you're just a beginner because one of the ladies in the work-out routines performs a modified version that's low impact and easy to follow if your strength/balance isn't at the same level as Zaki. After a week of using the modified work outs, I feel confident enough to follow Zaki's instructions, and if there's a day I'm feeling ""off"", I just follow the woman doing the modified instructions.",1456185600,,736,4.340579710144928

3645814,4,B001HZ4K76,"I love workouts that are 30 minutes or less and this one takes the cake as you can do just one 20 minute workout. You can do the warm up (5 min) & cool down (9 min) but you have the option at the menu to not do either. This would make the workouts a total of 34 minutes if you choose to do them. I do my own warm up and cool down which only a take a few minutes each so my workout can stay under 30 minutes like I prefer.

I took off a star for two reasons. I like the instructor as she comes off very sweet and gentle yet firm but I feel a lot of moves are done too fast or she switches to a new move too fast- especially during the cardio blasts. I feel the cool down is unnecessarily long.

Other than that, nice dvd. Would recommend for those who want short but effective workouts.",1434931200,,785,3.8098159509202456

Violet is encouraging in a crisp, friendly way.  Not too much talk. Everything sounds better with a British accent.  There's two other exercisers with her - one who does a modified version for beginners or those who want low impact on the joints.  Like the beat and the setting - kind of a brick loft background.

It is not one of those tortuous workouts that leave you exhausted for the rest of the day - it actually leaves me energized!  This gives a vigorous all over conditioning - arms, abs, legs, core - along with a really nice cool down.  I love that Violet is encouraging and not obnoxious or berating.  I use Bob Harper and Jackie Warner videos and also workout on a StairMaster.  This is a welcome, lower impact inclusion into my weekly workout rotation.

She changes the move at the same time she cues it so you are trying to catch up.  That is annoying and takes the fun out.  Secondly, the music sucks big time - not motivating at all.  I know that for the most part, workout music on these DVDs is bland but this one...awful! Thirdly, I don't think she does enough reps to really be effective. She tries to be creative with the moves but they end up feeling awkward.  Fourth, she is anorexic looking.  Her body is not inspiring to me.  Her 2 back up girls' bodies look much, much healthier to me.  Last but not least, I had some unusual pain in my back after doing this workout.  Again, I workout everyday so it's not like my body is not used to working out.  I am not sure if the awkward moves did something to my back or not.

She stayed on an exercise just the right amount of time - not too boring, but not changing up so much that you spend time trying to catch up.  It is a pretty set and I like that she does all the exercises with you.  If you play the whole video to try to get a full workout, she stops between the warm up and the first and second workout session and talks.  It's too easy for an intermediate to begin with, but to literally stop between sections and listen to her is not ideal.

I previewed it on Amazon streaming but decided to purchase a used DVD instead - even so it still ends up in the Bottom 1/3 - nothing new move / technique wise so that leaves motivation & production value. I find the ""Setting"" visually distracting, not striking a balance between the stark ""industrial look"", the people & that Bonsai Tree so concentration & flow is an effort-especially in tandem with the ""Narration Brakes"" and the always moving camera crane & MTV style editing. Thankfully the music volume was low.

Motivation wise, all the ""Cookie Cutter Bio-Buzz "" words are there but the voice on my GPS has more feeling, even with Violet's accent which i though would be a plus.

The second includes the warm-up, interval calorie burn, which includes sculpting, strength training, cardio blasts, a great deal of floor work, combined with a few kick boxing moves, and the cool down (20 + minutes).

I wish all of these workout DVDs would list a target fitness level they are gearing the workout towards.  They would probably get higher ratings all around.

I would say this workout would be a good challenge for beginners that are working their way up the fitness ladder.  You can use the modifications to start out, then follow the main instructor as you work your way up.  That said, I still got less than 10 minutes in my target zone (the rest of it too low rather than too high.)  While I did work up a modest sweat using 10 lb weights and doing a low jog instead of walks between sets, the few moves that were intermediate were done too few times (both frequency and duration) to start to burn.

Acacia generally produces excellent quality workout videos and this is no exception (filming, sets, DVD options etc.)  I couldn't really hear any music which is a good or bad thing depending.  I don't like chirpy, over-cheery instructors and over-smiley, whooping backup folk.  I prefer serious and rather intense with occasional encouragement.

I have not used the video enough to know if it affects my weight, but it did get me into good shape.  I was sweating and running to keep up with her, but did not feel it was impossible.  Definitely a good balance when buying a video to challenge you.

Once I felt I had mastered the video after a couple months, I bought a weight lifting video which was impossible at that time. I still use this video alternating with the weight lifting video. This is a great moderate workout when I am sore. It is great to help me increase the amount of weight I use so that I am stronger without being sore at the heavier weight level.

It includes whole body balancing which is still challenging. There are cardio sections that are still challenging. The best feature of the video is it mixes challenging moves with periods of easier moves so that you can catch your breath when needed.

3645875,5,B001HZ4K76,"I've had this DVD for some time, but felt moved to review it because it has stood the test of time with me:  in fact, I like it better now than when I first used it.

Violet Zaki is perfectly charming and cues well.  Always nice to have in an instructor.  She even cracks a few jokes -- not a comedy routine, just some words to make you smile.  Very likeable.

The workouts have a nice mixture of cardio and weight training, often together, which is how I like it.

Some of the moves, especially the mat work, looked ungainly to me at first, and I tended to skip them.  But now I find myself doing them because -- well, I suppose I'm improving.

Flexibility is important in doing these exercises and I like the stretches that Zaki has you do.  Her cool-down is terrific, really enjoyable.

There are one or two things she does, for a brief time, such as 'heel digs', that don't really do anything for me, or that make me concerned about my knees (I've had slight injuries), but at those times I just modify the exercise.  I don't feel that a DVD workout is something that I have to follow at all times, chapter and verse, and sometimes I prefer to keep the previous movement going while they move on to something else.  Or I change to heavier weights or keep my weights if they've put theirs down.  Obviously you have to be aware of what you're doing and think of safety, but if you're an experienced exerciser you can spontaneously 'tailor' a workout while still benefitting from having one to follow.

As for the reviewer that claims 'I didn't break a sweat', well, congratulations, you must be in excellent shape!  But in that case I don't think this DVD is for you.  As Zaki says throughout the workout, it's for people who want to improve their fitness:  either those 'new to working out' (who may follow the modified movements of one of the women) or those that are up to a lot more but might have some weight to lose.  I am fairly slim, but I like to have this workout as part of my  routine.

It was so boring that I had to stop it in the middle of the workout and return to one of my standby favorites. Also, the instructor made me feel terrible about my size, even though I am in shape. She is WAY too skinny! It's actually quite frightening to look at her. I found it distracting, not to mention discouraging. What a waste of money. Acacia makes far better workout routines than this (I recommend Strong Body Ageless Body with Erin O'Brien). Don't waste your time or money.

3645877,5,B001HZ4K76,"My workout regimen is an extensive collection of fitness dvds. If I feel my motivation waning, I'll buy one or two new ones so I wound up with quite a rotation of a library of workout dvds. Because of this, I'm picky about which ones I like, which ones I keep, and I have quite a comparison.

INSTRUCTION:
 Excellent. The instructor has a soothing British accent and is very calm yet she pushes you with her WORDS rather than with yelling at you. Her energy is excellent, as is that of those who follow her in the dvd.

CUEING:
Great cueing. I did get tripped up once but I can assure you, for me, that's great cueing. I have two left feet and found her very easy to follow.

CALORIC BURN:
Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt takes to heart the evidence that the most effective workout will get your heart rate up but still allow it to roller coaster down some, then do strength training and alternate this fat burning and muscle building circuit through the workout. I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn so I can actually SEE scientifically how many calories a workout I do burns and how many calories I burn per minute doing it...and this was a scorcher!! However, the moves really worked my muscles well too which means, with strength training, you continue to burn calories long after the workout is done in addition to the cardio he has which burns them fast during the workout. But whether you measure your own caloric burn or not, you'll feel your heart rate stay in the prime fat burning zone. It gets it up there!

WHY CIRCUIT TRAINING DOESN'T BURN YOU OUT BUT BURNS THE CALORIES:
Many people still hold to the myth that in order to burn the most fat you have to work out as hard as you can. The most extensive studies in the last few years that are now accepted as medical fact  show that, just as a car that goes really fast then slows down then goes really fast and slows down uses more fuel than a car that goes 90mph the whole time, so does your body use more fuel (fat) doing the same roller coaster of speed. You don't have to feel like you are going to pass out in a workout to actually be burning more fat. This is why circuit training is now the ""go to"" workout when in the 70s and 80s it was all aerobics.  An all cardio workout burns more calories during the workout but, although strength training won't make you break the same sweat or burn as much during the workout, it actually continues burning calories long after the workout is over and builds muscle which means you burn more calories even when your body is at rest. I measure all of the above...my caloric boost for the day, during the workout, and how many the workout burns per minute to get the full picture.

SET: Love the set. Looks like they cleared out a cool urban New York loft. Throw some furniture in that place and I'd be happy staying there long after the workout is done...(it may look like a brick warehouse with cool windows to anyone else, but I'm all about urban loft architecture so maybe I just see it as such)So...it's different and different is good when you have rotate fitness dvds

MUSIC: Upbeat electronica...gets you revved.

NEGATIVES:
I found the warm up to be too long. My heart rate got up well once the workout began but the low intensity warm up took too much time from the workout that could be burning fat since it's longer than most warm ups. Not a big deal to me. I now warm up a couple minutes on my own then play the workout or hit fast forward after I've done it a couple minutes so I don't spend more time than is needed in this state rather than the actual workout, especially if I'm pressed for time.  Also if you aren't good at balance at this point in your fitness routine, you may feel tripped up at the beginning of the second routine. She doesn't mention this, but simply resting your other foot on the floor rather than raising it (until you build up your balance abilities, which you will) will work just fine.

CONCLUSION: This workout is a favorite and gets the results. It burns off the fat, builds the muscle and the instruction is excellent. Great caloric burn and good circuit workout mix. You'll feel it and it'll work.

It is definitely great for beginners as she really breaks things up and gives you periodic times to recover (which I truly believe are not necessary for the cardio sections are not that demanding).  But as I said, when I don't have that much energy, this is the workout I turn to, you have to diversify.",1245196800,4,709,4.153284671532846
3645882,2,B001HZ4K76,The thought that Violet Zaki ever had an ounce of fat on her body is implausible given her shockingly anorexic appearance. She is so thin that it distracts from the whole workout. I found the workout to be very run-of-the-mill gym fare and have been happily using Jillian Michael's workout 30-day shred with a much harder workout and finally some results. Pass on this video if you are serious about getting fit.,1243123200,4,412,4.736111111111111
3645883,5,B001HZ4K76,"I have recently lost 30 pounds, using primarily reclining bike/walking as my exercise of choice, and I was looking for something different to keep things interesting and maintain my momentum.  I really enjoy the instructor, she is positive, encouraging, but not ""over the top"".  The workouts are a good challenge level for me, as someone regaining muscle tone and strength.  I especially like that there is a supporting character who is doing ""simpler"" moves while you work up to what Violet is doing -- unlike the companion Pilates video by Kristin (see other review).  One item not mentioned in other reviews is that many/most strength moves are done by balancing on one leg, or similar.  I've found this a real challenge to start, and have definitely improved my balance (and assumedly my strength as well) through these moves.  Finally, as others have mentioned, the multi-format selections are great -- helps keep it interesting and fits in my work/two kids schedule more easily.  Recommend!!",1242432000,5,997,5.079754601226994
3645884,5,B001HZ4K76,I've purchased at least a dozen workout DVDs in the past few months looking for the right balance of cardio and  strength training.  This is the best (!) and far superior to Jillian's 30 Day Shred.  Violet is an excellent instructor and the workout is highly effective.,1241740800,4,269,4.680851063829787
3645885,5,B001HZ4K76,this became my favorite workout DVD the first time out of the box! You can really feel results so it makes you want to find the time to use it.,1239840000,2,143,3.8
3645886,4,B001HZ4K76,"I've never seen this lady before, but decided it was time I get out of my comfort zone.  I really like these workouts.  I prefer the first one over the second one, though.  They run about 34 minutes each and are perfect for me to do before work.",1238803200,2,245,4.0625
3645887,3,B001HZ4K76,After reading all the great reviews.  I was expecting a challenging good hard workout.  But after completing the first workout I didn't even break a sweat. So I decided to do the other workout too.  It was better then the first. This a a good workout for beginners or if you want a light workout. Not for the intermediate or advance exerciser.,1236729600,9,343,4.5

8310199,1,B001HZ4K76,"Did not like it at all.  Did cardio like 10 min combined.
A lot of balance and stretching but didn't develop a sweat. Waste of time and money !
I did it all at once and she speaks in between segments. Introduction in each one. Terrible!",1509667200,,236,4.130434782608695

8310205,5,B001HZ4K76,I've been doing this streaming video for at least five year and it never gets old. Great flexibility - you can do one or two 20 min sections and either way get a great workout. My heart rate always gets way up and the intervals of cardio and weights are great for burning calories.  She also does all cardio engaging two muscle groups. I do the workout at least once a week to break up monotony of the bike/walking/running. Violet also has a kick boxing streaming video on Amazon that is also great for mixing things up.,1485388800,4,520,4.360824742268041
8310206,5,B001HZ4K76,"I just started this workout to rotate with 30 day shred so I don't get bored.  Although it is not as hard, it's still a very good workout and actually works some new areas that 30 day shred doesn't.  I also like the trainer, she is motivating but not annoying.",1480377600,2,260,4.18
