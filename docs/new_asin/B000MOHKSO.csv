8170452,4,B000MOHKSO,"I watched this video in a graduate psychology class last night.  By the end, I had burst into tears.  I am a domestic violence survivor, and currently in training as a therapist.  One of the main things I have grieved over in my own experience is my church leadership's--who i have always highly respected--failure to realize the seriousness of my situation, and unwillingness to discipline my husband(a leader in the church). I felt so betrayed!  Watching this video, I realized that church ignorance and apathy is not a thing of the past but is alive and well.  While I believe in the sufficiency of Scripture, I do think that church leaders make a grave mistake when they shun information and training that is deemed too ""secular"". They think they know all they need to know, but they're wrong and their attitudes and decisions reflect that.  This seems to be particularly true when the domestic abuse falls short of hitting.  But psychological, financial, and spiritual abuse can be just as horrific.  Laypeople and anyone who intends to be a therapist should view this video or others like it.  As a culture, we won't resist what we don't firmly grasp.",1205971200,3,1157,4.803030303030303
