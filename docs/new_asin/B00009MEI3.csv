7991468,4,B00009MEI3,"""Great American Western Vol 17"", are mostly made for TV movies. It's a mix of drama and comedy and ranges 40 years and are all in color. There are some very recognizable names, and some good action sprinkled throughout this mixed bag of drama and comedy.

First up is ""Yuma""(1970) Clint Walker mosies into town as the new lawman who is determined to clean up the lawlessness that has taken over. He works double duty though trying to keep law and order and also trying to prove his own innocence in a murder rap that is a frame up. This was a pretty good film, I liked it the best of these 4. Barry Sullivan and Edgar Buchanan also star.

1977 ""The Wackiest Wagon Train In The West"". Okay this film is kind of goofy. Bob Denver, is a silly Scout assistant to a bumbling Wagonmaster. Sound familiar? wait you haven't heard it all. There's an older wealthy couple, a showgirl, a girl next door type and a really smart guy. And we follow all their misadventures in the Old West. It may as well be Gilligan's Island, in a different setting, with different people in the roles. Forrest Tucker, Lori Saunders and Jeannie Riley also star. Good for a few laughs, but not as funny as Gilligan.

An old Sunset Carson oater is included. ""Sunset Carson Rides Again"" from 1948 is an enjoyable view. Sunset takes in a wayward youth who think Sunset killed his Pa. Crooked partners are also trying to best Carson, and singing cowboys the ""Rodeo Revelers"" add their charms.

""The Gunfighters"" from 1987, the newest of the group, are 3 cousins trying to rescue the family ranch from greedy land grubber George Kennedy. One has visions of being like Billy the Kid, and has a taste of what that is like as they become outlaws in the process.

Don't expect a Criterion like transfers of these films. They are not the greatest. Grainy pictures and sometimes color that goes in and out. But for the price, and the fun of these, western lovers really cant go wrong. Each volume comes in a keep case, each with different cowboy artwork. Each film has been enhanced in DD5.1. There isn't anything about the films that will take away from your viewing pleasure.

P.S. Amazon sometimes tends to lump all the reviews of the Great American Western volumes together. Please make sure you are on the buying page of the volume you intend to purchase.",1135555200,,2362,4.556603773584905
7991469,3,B00009MEI3,"This is a single-sided DVD containing the following four color westerns: 1) 'The Gunfighters'; 1987; Art Hindle, George Kennedy; Three brothers become bandits in order to fight a greedy land baron. 2) 'Yuma'; 1971; Clint Walker, Barry Sullivan; A town is forced to shape-up when the new sheriff arrives. Others have plans for the new sheriff. See some of your favorite 'Bonanza' guest stars in another western. 3) 'The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West'; 1977; Bob Denver, Forrest Tucker; 'Gilligan's Island' heads West with the cast of 'Petticoat Junction'. Sherwood Schwartz again assaults our senses. 4) 'Sunset Carson Rides Again'; 1947; Sunset Carson, Pat Starling; An early color oater. Sunset as a good guy rancher has to deal with a bad guy rancher and his henchmen. Of course Sunset always rides tall in the saddle.--Three of these films are Platinum's usual muddy affair although 'The Gunfighters' is a good print and among one of my favorites. 'Sunset Carson Rides Again' is not one of my favorites but still a good Saturday Matinee oater. For those who may like to see more Sunset Carson films, I highly recommend 'Call of the Rockies' which is an action-packed black and white western with a good plot. 'Yuma' is a made for TV western which does feature several actors you may have seen as guest stars on 'Bonanza'. There are eight chapter breaks for each film and no bonus material on the DVD. As usual Platinum's collection DVDs do not offer high quality but they certainly are a bargain.--Bob",1102550400,5,1507,4.890625
