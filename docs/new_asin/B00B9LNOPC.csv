5564761,5,B00B9LNOPC,"I first discovered this show on Netflix and then when I saw the series for sale on Amazon I decided I needed to own it. It's nice to watch a teen show that isn't just about hanging out.  As a former dancer, I love watching the choreography and of course the dancers are amazing.  Can't wait for season 3!",1373155200,,304,4.135593220338983
5564762,5,B00B9LNOPC,"I've streamed the first two seasons of this show, originally attracted by the ballet setting and quickly becoming completely addicted. I'm a grandmother watching a show developed for teens, but am enthralled by the acting, dancing and character development. The dancing and choreography are first rate (particularly in season 2) and deserve special mention. I'm eagerly awaiting  the third season, which has been completed and will air on Australian tv in June 2013.",1367625600,4,466,5.383561643835616
5564763,5,B00B9LNOPC,My daughter and I have watched this series on TV and it is a great show! The dancing is superb and fits into the storyline. The actors are great and the writing wonderful! This is a great series for teens. Get it.,1365206400,,213,4.095238095238095
8564748,5,B00B9LNOPC,Very entertaining & slightly addictive!  I like how I can watch it while my 7 y.o. is in the living room and not constantly be worrying about inappropriate language or sexual content.,1519171200,,183,4.71875

8564751,3,B00B9LNOPC,"Cute story, but sheep farmers in Australia are not candidates for dance. Farmers down under are enormous heavy people,  not suited to the city life or for dancing.",1453420800,,163,4.821428571428571

8564753,5,B00B9LNOPC,"Seen through Tara Webster's eyes, a country girl, joins an elite dance company that very few can get into to.  It's a high school for dancers and only two out of the entire group will ever go on to be prima ballerinas or even in the cor de ballet.  She meets carefree Kat, daughter of a prima ballerina, who would just like to have a parent who stayed at home and gave her attention...Christian, who is in the school as a type of therapy from crime-a natural dancer, and a Jewish boy who unfortunately suddenly finds out he's gay-after appearing to be heterosexual all along...that's in volume 2-and that's really quite unbelievable.  Otherwise, except for lack of adults at night time in the dorms-a definite cafeteria for them to eat in-and Ethan, a third year-who's supposed to be a great dancer, but we never see him dance-it's a very good show-well written-great balance of dance, drama, comedy....and the kids are really kids-not adults playing kids.  For that reason, and that reason alone-Dance Academy-is a show to be watched.",1408665600,2,1035,4.797752808988764

8564756,5,B00B9LNOPC,"A somewhat slow start, but all of us you love dance will soon become addicted. A great story unfolds as the dance students improve their craft.",1397260800,,143,4.538461538461538
