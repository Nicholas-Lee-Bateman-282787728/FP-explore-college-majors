842444,5,6304238096,"Everything has a genesis and Death Race 2000 is the progenitor of a whole class of road race movies. It was released in 1975 and became a cult classic. The idea of scoring points for the different pedestrians was sick, brilliant but defintely the product of a twisted mind. It did become a cultural meme for a while though. It may still be. It's not a big budget film. The cars are cheesy and the script and photography are nothing to write home about either. That it has a relatively happy ending is quite a surprise.
David Carradine delivers a restrained and mostly convincing performance as Frankenstein the driver who can't be killed and Sylvester Stallone is suitably over the top as ""Machine Gun Joe"".

This movie has almost endless replay value for anyone who loves to watch Corman movies, and odd, bizarre B movies. I cannot begin to describe this movie except that it is like a horrible sci-fi version of ""Cannonball Run""...with what I can only describe as a strange twist of humor. Trust Me, it is hard to turn off, it is so completely strange and hilarious. As the protagonist, Carradine is enough to make you laugh for 2 hours.....And yep, Sly Stallone makes it even better.",1484524800,,653,4.839285714285714

842744,5,6304238096,"Blu-ray offers a very nice video & audio upgrade from all previous format versions of this, the blackest of cult classic comedies.

THE STORY: In the dystopian future year of 2000, nationally-celebrated racers in wildly insane-looking customized cars throttle across country in the annual Trans-Continental Road Race; America's favorite sport. A thoroughly twisted bonus aspect of this ultra-violent mechanized marathon is that the drivers can score additional points during the race by running down men, women and children! Legendary winner of multiple races... the often crashed & smashed, creamed & reamed but never down & out champion, ""Frankenstein"" (an appropriately menacing & stoic performance by David 'Kung Fu' Carradine), is the odds on favorite to take the crown once again, but the other blood-thirsty drivers, (a young Sylvester Stallone, in his second starring role, among them), are going to use every nasty, under-handed trick they can to eliminate Frankenstein and capture first place. As if that wasn't enough tension, a small band of government resistance rebels have hatched a plot to stop the Death Race. To this end, they have entrenched a double agent amongst the racers to sabotage the proceedings whenever possible. Their ultimate goal is to unseat the self-appointed Christ-like President of the United States and overthrow the iron-fisted rule of his thoroughly corrupt totalitarian government.

THOUGHTS: Paul Bartel directs this wild, one-of-a-kind, low budget, high speed crashfest with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek.  The violence is so over the top that it borders on cartoonish. The motivations of the various (and strictly one-dimensional) characters are uncomplicated & straightforward. Genius genre producer Roger Corman puts his indelible stamp on this crazed film and gives viewers of the time something they had likely never seen before.  The more things change, it seems, the more they stay the same, so the movie's stinging political barbs are every bit as appropriate today as they were when the film was first released 40+ years ago. The thinly-veiled pokes at TV viewership & reality TV shows actually seem prophetically ahead of their time. The film manages to entertain, hitting all the right notes to keep it relevant & poignant even all these decades later. The wild car designs & energetically suicidal racing action continue to delight long-time enthusiasts of the film and draw new legions of fans, generation after generation. Yes, the film is cruel and decidedly insane, but it's also wickedly funny. That makes it hard NOT to enjoy, especially from a black comedy perspective.

THE BLU-RAY: This new release from Shout! Factory revs up the screen with a truly impressive picture & thundering sound. Original film elements were used to achieve the best possible picture and the resulting remastering is a major improvement in every way over all previous formats. I've had this film on VHS, DVD ...and now this beautiful Blu-ray. It looks just amazing here. The restored picture contains only minimal artifacting & pixelation; hardly any dust, dirt or debris to detract from the garish color scheme. Focus is quite sharp in most of the scenes. Sound is clear, strong & level. Honestly, if you already have DR2k on DVD, I can whole-heartedly recommend this upgrade as being absolutely worth the double dip. But wait... the improved picture & sound quality are just the tip of the iceberg. There are also several interesting behind the scenes featurettes, with recollections from both fans of the film and the original crew that helped make it. Interestingly enough, some of the best tales come from the woman who did the costume designs for the film. The interview with Ib Melchoir, whose story ""The Racer"" was the inspiration for the film, is well worth watching, too. All in all, this is a terrific release worthy of your attention & ownership! 5 STARS!",1439424000,5,3916,5.199683042789223

842860,3,6304238096,"Cult hero Paul Bartel directed this low-budget satire in which America's passion for cars, violence, and sporting events are finally brought together in one convenient package. Death Race 2000 is a cult action film that stars David Carradine, Simone Griffeth and Sylvester Stallone. The film takes place in a dystopian American society in the year 2000, where the murderous Transcontinental Road Race has become a form of national entertainment. The screenplay is based on the short story The Racer by Ib Melchior.

In the not-so-distant future or year 2000, the United States has become a totalitarian regime overseen by the charming but sinister Mr. President, who, in order to satisfy the masses' need for entertainment has created a new national sport -- the Death Race, a nationwide road rally in which the winner is not determined by who finishes first, but by who scores the most points along the way by running over hapless pedestrians. Aspiring champions Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, Calamity Jane , Nero the Hero, and Matilda the Hun are all looking to take the top honors away from Frankenstein,a half-man/half-machine who has been built to be the best racer on Earth and can outrun and outkill anyone on the circuit. However, not everyone likes the Death Race, and revolutionary leader Thomasina Paine wants to sabotage the event in the name of restoring democracy; her plan is to foil Frankenstein's expected victory by smuggling her daughter Annie into Frankenstein's race car as his navigator.

The movie about the story about a road race in the not-too-distant future for which the drivers are given points for running down pedestrians becomes an elaborate and telling fantasy about our peculiar taste and love for violence as telling tales of our choices in popular entertainment. It also shows of what things will become of our movies the years after Death Race 2000 was shown back in 1975. Aside from violence,the nudity featured in this film also proves that provide the viewer's satisfaction for sex as well. Overall,this movie tries to become a prelude of what things will become in the movies.",1433721600,,2112,5.048710601719198
842861,4,6304238096,"David Carradines character is cold and calculative while maintaining his humanity. While most drivers in the movie go for the easy scoring targets he goes for the higher scoring overlooked targets. This makes his character a more likable representation of a Death Racer.  This film kept me captivated as a kid with its cruelty and psychotic transformation of what I considered society consisted of. A set of rules and moralities that allowed for a safe and orderly existence. This movie threw all that out the window and there was no real reason for it other than society had become filled with blood thirsty madmen held high by corporate/government power and influence.

The film took everything about the world as we knew it and threw it into the fire to listen to the sizzling of a fired carcass. To this day this movie runs through my mind as I slow for a red light while some one crosses the street. Even entering a hospital or shopping center parking lot brings images of altered metallic beasts souped up with claws and knives of steel jutting from every available point rushing through the car park wiping out those who where to slow to make it inside or into their cars.

Death Race 2000 is a total exploitation of violence and lawlessness that brings the gore. The dialogue is minimal and the kills are gruesome. It is a fun ride into an apocalyptic hell where heros are madmen in hot rods of horror. A great film that is easy to watch, filled with death and brutality. There is even a message about being too content with societal standards. For me this was the movie that made me fall in love with futuristic flicks.",1433462400,,1628,4.626297577854671

You get the idea that he is one of many of a franchise of drivers for the big Death Race and whether he lives or dies doesn't matter.

Okay, even though the movie was cheesy and it was a total 70's television ""like"" production, it was just plain fun to watch. Had to watch till the end to see the outcome. Simple plot with cheesy lines, meant to be a serious movie about what the future may hold, but delivered at a comedic level. If you like stupid, cornball comedies, you should like this movie.

843360,4,6304238096,"I finally discovered this legendary, grotesque and disturbing 1975 Roger Corman production and I must say I am glad that I did - although I wouldn't go as far as saying that I liked it because it is not exactly a film you like..))) Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

In an alternate reality timeline, in the Year of Disgrace 2000, USA are an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship known us United Provinces of America (UPA), ruled by a unique party formed by a fusion of Republicans and Democrats and known as ""Bipartisan Party"". At the head of the state is Mr President - it is his official title and official name and nobody uses his real name.

In order to provide entertainment in 1980 the Bipartisan Party created ""the Annual Transcontinental Road Race"", a competition between teams composed each of one driver and one navigator, who operate specially decorated and armed cars. In order to win however it is not enough to arrive first to the finish line - it is also necessary to score a maximum of points, by chasing and killing innocent pedestrians...

This film tells the story of Death Race 2000, in which five teams will compete. The drivers, who are the man stars, are all well known veterans of previous editions:

- ""Frankenstein"" (David Carradine), mutilated, disfigured champion in title, always wearing a mask.
- ""Machine Gun"" Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone), ""loved by thousands, hated by millions"", challenger for the title
- ""Matilda the Hun"" (Roberta Collins), ""America's little svastika honey"" (she drives a car looking like a V-1 flying bomb)
- ""Calamity"" Jane Kelly (Mary Woronov), a hot babe dressed as a cowgirl
- ""Nero the Hero"" Lonagan (Martin Kove), a guy trying to look as a Roman gladiator

The only recognizable actors in this film are of course post-Kung Fu David Carradine and pre-Rocky Sylvester Stallone. ""Sly"" was in this time in fact still a struggling young actor and it was only his second real role ever, after appearing as Frank Nitti in ""Capone"" earlier the same year (before that he made just cameos, mostly uncredited).

I will not say much here about the story, other than this is a quite typical low-budget Roger Corman film, so you can expect cheap decorations, some lame special effects, actors who can barely act and especially actresses who got their roles for their looks (and possibly some services rendered) rather than for any kind of talent. Also present are acting taken directly from porn movies, some bad taste jokes, graphic violence, some sex and nudity (but not strong language and no F-bombs).

And yet, SURPRISE, SURPRISE, in this film this coctail actually somehow WORKS, mostly because of the darkest kind of black humour which keeps all this together. The completely over the top, outrageous scenario makes this film of course quite disturbing by moments, but all in all also quite watchable. I must admit that when the final credits started rolling to my surprise I found myself quite content - in fact that was a quite satisfactory, although funny tasting, viewing experience...

If you didn't see this movie yet, I really recommend it, as it is a kind of cult film - and honestly, it deserves this status...",1403654400,,3192,4.876383763837638

Drivers earn points by killing bystanders whose value is determined by age and gender.  A precursor to The Running Man, Battle Royal, and The Hunger Games, this film is a social satire from Roger Corman's company. In this world, the government and celebrity-obsessed TV talking heads use the race to distract the masses from real world problems and to hide the fact that they all live under a secret dictatorship. Despite the movie's limitations -locations referenced as New York are painfully recognized as southern California, what should be matte paintings appear to be drawn with colored pencil, and race cars that should stripped of all unnecessary weight are outfitted with weapons and decorative animal motifs- I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1398816000,,888,5.117241379310345

It's a low-low budget movie that can't escape its slipshod script, the lame attempt to appear futuristic with clothes that clearly indicate that it was made in 1974, the FX is very substandard, the hue and cry over the so-called gore is laughable (it's quite tame by today's standards, the fake blood looks like paint).  As for the acting, some of it was very enthusiastic.  I only recognized a few members of the cast: David Carradine as Frankenstein, Sylvester Stallone as Machine-Gun Joe, Martin Kove as Nero the Hero, Mary Woronov as Calamity Jane, and Fred Grandy (of all people) as Herman the German.  The racing sequences are pretty basic.  It's the social satire that keeps this film from being more than just an odd curio.

There's gore, but under Paul Bartel's direction, it never gets too gory; clever editing makes you think you're seeing more than you are.

Here's the scoop. In the near-ish future America is a different country ruled by a lifetime president and sporting a new flag. It's a repressive society that uses a violent road game as the end all, be all in sporting events. Five teams race across country to New Los Angeles and rack up points on the way by running over pedestrians.

Who would have ever thought a kid's game would be twisted into a plot? With Paul Bartel in the director's seat you know it will have a dizzy perspective and it does. This is played for camp. It's got a lot of off-beat plot twists and dialogue. David Carradine is on hand as Frankenstein who is not as he appears to be. You also have a pre-fame Sylvester Stallone as a Chicago hood, replete with gangster garb and tough guy talk. Mary Woronov is her usual sultry self. There might be a few other recognizable faces but that's pretty much it.

This has a look that is typical for its time and place as an indy flick. It looks like a Roger Corman outing with a few more bucks in the budget. Bartel actually took some time to frame some nice shots. The cars are a hoot. The drivers and their navigators are all 'characters.' The dames are gorgeous, sexy and spend enough time in the buff to keep a young boy's heart racing. The acting is on par with the content and the music score is a little weird. Seeing cars racing down the road with classical type music in the back might leave you scratching your head.

Carradine is a fish out of water trying to play it straight, while Stallone embraces the cheese and comes off as the much better fit.

DEATH RACE 2000 is as absurd, outrageous, and over-the-top as its name implies. David Carradine stars as the fan-favorite Frankenstein, an honorable athlete with a calm and collected demeanor that earned him the win in the earlier races. Playing opposite of Carradine is Sylvester Stallone as the rude, crude Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, the scourge of the racing world that will stop at nothing to win. Each of the killer cars sport their own unique designs that give them a life of their own as they rip across the deserted country roads. Paul Bartel and 2nd unit director Charles Griffith pour plenty of heart-pounding intensity into the high-speed action sequences, which still hold up to today's standards despite some obvious manipulation to the film speed. On top of everything else, the script shows frequent signs of intelligence beneath its rough exterior. For a film that exists outside of the Horror genre, it also boasts an incredible number of gory deaths and bloody effects. DEATH RACE 2000 is wickedly funny, deliciously dark, and ultra-violent, making it the ultimate crowd-pleaser for Action and Horror fans alike.

What I would have wanted to know before purchasing, is that the DVD, was made from an average copy of a VHS tape.  The quality of the video was mediocre at best.  The only way to watch the film in it's entirety is to watch the first chapter, then click on the second chapter. Watch the second chapter then click on the third chapter, to watch that part, and on and on.

I'd heard many things about it before that night; how gory it was, how unnecessary its nudity was, how it put Sylvester Stallone on the map before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B000JSI7DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>...but what I saw that night was a profound, humorous and thought-provoking social commentary on society's uncontrollable infatuation with violence.

In director Paul Bartel's alternate version of the year 2000, the United States is a self-righteous totalitarian dictatorship run under the fist of ""Mister President"". A violent obsession consumes the nation, its outlet the annual Transcontinental Road Race, where drivers earn points by running over innocent bystanders (more for mowing down children, disabled or the elderly). The film centers around Frankenstein (the late David Carradine), the prototypical ""iron man"", whose numerous injuries are as famous as his victories (hence, his nickname). However, the enigma surrounding this onyx-clad veteran of the ""Death Race"" may not be all it seems...

The film is tremendous social satire, lampooning the media, violence and the nature of competition itself. However, in spite of most of its brilliance and Bartel's trademark dark humor, the film is very much a low-budget product of its time. A Roger Corman production, the film is certainly low-budget, raunchy and bloody. The opening titles and establishing shot of the raceway are enough evidence. This film wasn't meant to blow viewers away with its visuals. Instead, in trademark Corman fashion, the positives are accentuated while the negatives are downplayed. If viewers look past its low budget, they'll discover a tremendously fun, entertaining and surprisingly intellectual experience.

Shout! Factory, producers of the amazing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaks-and-Geeks/dp/B0001EQHXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaks and Geeks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SCTV/dp/B000RK3JUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SCTV</a>&nbsp;box sets, helm this release and present it extremely faithfully. The 1080p transfer of the film is far from pristine given the limitations of its source material, but in spite of this, it's still a solid transfer. Its Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack is a bit of a disappointment in this era of lossless audio and bombastic low-end frequencies, but it does its job effectively. Once again, the explanation lies in the limitations and low budget of the source material.

As is the case with most of Shout! Factory's releases, the greatness lies in the supplements. Two audio commentaries and a collection of documentaries and featurettes (both in 480p and 1080p) cover all of the bases, from Corman's hilariously inaccurate estimation of Stallone's future career during production to production design, scripting, scoring and trailer-making (yes, trailer-making). Not only are these featurettes informative, but reveal a lot about the filmmaking process Corman perfected. Shout! Factory deserves a lot of the credit here, for their overview of the film is equally substantial and informative, with some laughs along the way.

Yes, it's dated, gory, goofy and sultry. Look beyond the obvious, however, and Death Race 2000 becomes a smart, satirical comment on contemporay American society's obsession with violence and its exploitation through media and politics. Shout! Factory does extremely well in bringing it to Blu-ray, providing everything a fan of the film needs to know. Both the film and blu-ray are surprisingly in-depth and entertaining.

DR2000 is a campy look at excess violence & nudity, celebrity status, and media's absurd hold on the nation. If anything, this has grown even worse since when this movie debuted. A look at media headlines on any given day will give you a fill of violence, the latest celebrity hi-jinks, and the media's opinions (which they butcher, skew, cook, and hand feed to you); but I digress.

The movie is low budget, even by '75 standards, but that is what makes it such a cult classic. The deaths are cheesy, the blood looks like red paint (it may very well be), the one liners are abundant, and it never takes itself too seriously. There are a spattering of future big name actors, with Stallone being the most obvious in his portrayal of Machine Gun Joe.

If you are looking for a serious action movie filled with car chases, explosions, over the top stunts, and other cool effects, this is not it. This is not your typicall Stallone movie either, so don't base your decision on that. What it is, is a low budget movie that has a more dark comedy feel to it. There are some fair special effects and a few big explosions, such as when a car hits a land mine. Otherwise...

What an incredible film, it's just so bad on so many levels.  The sound doesn't match the action.  The characters are paper-thin, ridiculous stereotypes.

The best part of this film all for me, other than the film's absolutely horrendous groaner of a punch line--one of the worst/best bad puns I've ever encountered--was the totally awesome/laughable fistfight between Carradine and Stallone.  Poor Sly--literally on the verge of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAO5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;glory--gets his butt kicked in a ridiculously choreographed punch-up by a junkie-thin Carradine, who doesn't even bust a sweat, leaving Stallone flopping on the floor, dripping the badly off-color stage blood.  The blond bimbo gets hot, and she and Carradine retire to their ultra-modern sleeping chamber for Carradine to strip down to his black leather undies.  Whew!

The continuity is just so incredibly bad.  You could play a ""Death Race Continuity Error"" drinking game, and if you drank every time you encountered a continuity flaw, you'd have alcohol poisoning within 30 minutes.  I mean, the race starts in New York City, and in the opening minutes of the race you see the cars blasting down open desert roadways, with the flippin' Sierra Madres in the background.  So marvelously bad.

Bottom line:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Race/dp/B000063K2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Race</a>&nbsp;this ain't.

This gem, much like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, or even The Toxic Avenger, is one of those films that is low-budge, knows it's low-budge, but still delivers on action, an incongruous yet straightforward story, and a happy ending with bunnies and snowflakes and delicate little flowers in deepest romantical springtime blossom.",1271030400,,4857,7.53886925795053

What's great about this movie is that the filmmakers obviously knew how ridiculous and fun the madness could be and played up that angle instead of the brutality of the kills. Don't get me wrong, the kills are still gory, but there is a tinge of humor to each one that takes the edge off.

The DVD has no features, just chapter selection, which happens to be its biggest and most egregious fault. The menu itself looks about the same quality as projects I did in high school.
Imagine my excitement watching one of my favorite films, which I finally own, when for unknown reasons after the first chapter the movie stops and switches to the chapter selection screen. A minor fault with the disk or possibly the DVD player? No. I resume the film and it continues to stop the movie after each and every chapter, returning to the chapter selection screen, forcing me to pick up the remote and select the next chapter.

In this Post-Apocalyptic film David Carradine plays Frankenstein, a man competing in a race that everyone in the world is watching. This of course is not your usual race, the men and women in the cars must eliminate (as in kill) the objects in front of them in the road; these objects go from workers, civilians, seniors and even kids. The way I'm describing it may seem as if this is a macabre film, but to be fully sincere...it isn't...Its mostly sarcastic humor.

Oh what fond memories that brings to the forefront of my memory.

This is such a fun satirical movie that you can't help but like it.

The one scene that always sticks in my mind as perhaps the most hilarious of the entire movie is when a bunch of doctors and nurses take a bunch of sick and elderly people and put them in the middle of the road prior to the racers arrival in order to help their favorite driver score some much needed points. They then hide in a driveway off to the side of the road in front of the hospital.

Well, along comes their favorite driver barreling down the road heading for the patients all lined-up in the middle of the road while they are all lined-up in the driveway. (I think you can see where this is going) Anyhow, the driver at the last instant turns into the driveway and proceeds to run over all of the doctors and nurses scoring those much needed points. Absolutely mind-blowing hysterical!

There are many more funny scenes in this movie and I am not going to spoil it by telling anymore. Suffice to say this is never going to be on AFI's Top 100 films of all times, but it will definitely make the ""Top 100 All Time Greatest Drive-In Movie Flicks.""

844320,5,6304238096,"I've ridiculed many a Roger Corman film in my time, but I have nothing but love for his 1975 B-movie triumph Death Race 2000 (although, to be fair, most of the credit should go to director Paul Bartel).  In this brilliant black comedy satire, Corman gives us what we want - fast cars, hot naked gals, and lots of glorified violence, not to mention brilliant performances by David Carradine and a pre-Rambo Sylvester Stallone - and all with a budget of only 300 grand.

In this futuristic vision of the year 2000, America has devolved into something of a fascist police state called the United Provinces, ruled from overseas by Mr. President (Sandy McCallum) who, like all good dictators, has established an external outlet for whatever bloodlust, anger, and general discontent that may exist among the populace.  Enter the Transcontinental Road Race, better known as the Death Race.  Now in its 20th iteration, this fierce competition pits the greatest, most fearless drivers in the land racing from New York to New Los Angeles.  Lest any visions of Cannonball Run threaten to run your head, know this: the beauty of the Death Race is the fact that extra points are awarded for any and all innocent spectators you kill along the way, with children and seniors bringing in the most points (if you don't think this is great fun, you haven't played any of the games in the Carmageddon series, which count among my favorite games of all time).

This year's contestants are Nero the Hero, Matilda the Hun (with Representative Fred ""Gopher"" Grandy as her navigator Herman the German), Calamity Jane Kelly, Machine-Gun Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone), and the fan favorite, Frankenstein (David Carradine).  Frankenstein is something of a mystery man, his mask and cowl hiding a body that has had more parts replaced than your grandfather's beat-up old pickup.  He and Machine-Gun Joe are bitter rivals, but this year the greatest threat Frankenstein faces is a plot by the Resistance, led by Thomasina Paine (Harriet Medin), to put an end to the barbaric race once and for all (using - wouldn't you know it? - barbaric methods of their own).

From euthanasia day at the hospital to the wickedly tripped-out cars designed for human carnage as well as speed, Death Race 2000 is a tour de force of B-movie entertainment.  The sociopolitical statement the film makes is also very real and important, but I'll leave the interpretation of all that to the individual viewer.  Carradine's amazing, Stallone's a brilliant bonus, the supporting cast make hay with even the smallest of parts (The Real Don Steele, anyone?), and Simone Griffeth is fun to watch both in and out of her clothes (and I haven't even mentioned the whole French Air Force thing).

The very formula of a Cult classic film, ""Death Race 2000"" is the kind of bad B-movie that is so entertaining, we can't help to enjoy its weirdness and bad taste, chewing every delicious piece of this campy Sci-Fi action satire cake.

As the very precursor of the 1987 feature ""The Running Man"" , this 1975 masterpiece in action and speed was director Paul Bartel's most influential and polemic description and vision of American society back in those days:  In a not so distant future, the United States has become a totalitarian regime overseen by the sinister and charismatic Mr. President, who in order to satisfy the masses's hunger for entertainment and thirst for violence, has created a new National Sport: The Death Race: a nationwide road rally in wich the winner is determined by who scores the more points along the way by running over distracted pedestrians.

The contestants for this atrocity made sport, rank among the most hilarious cult characters ever created for such an oddball and peculiar film: Italian thug ""Machine Gun"" Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone in a perfect role, between porn and Rocky), cowgirl Calamity Jane (played by cult icon Mary Woronov),arrogant muscle-head Nero the Hero (Martin Kove), and Nazi party supporter Matilda the Hun (Roberta Collins), have accepted the challenge to conquer the throne dominated by the most eccentric character, Champion, deadly speed-driver and national hero ""Frankenstein"" (B-movie veteran David Carradine making a break from the Kung Fu TV series), a half man-half machine  built to be the best racer on earth. Adding to this outrageous competition, Revolutionary leader Thomasina Paine looks to sabotage the event in order to restore democracy, trying to destroy the racers and their built-for-kill speeding machines with traps and set-ups.

Satirizing the blood lust of extreme sports and focusing on the TV shows encouraging the audiences for more, this grim and quirky visual work manages to keep the viewer out of these today's realities, because of the whole new light atmosphere created to portray this absurd futuristic dystopia. The stereotyped odd characters from every corner of insanity, the obssesive quest for glory and the lost of the human's life value, are far more shocking situations in this movie than the cultural critic implied. Needles to say, the movie's aesthetics look cheap and not totally credible, adding more fun to the experience and substracting sobriety, gravity and of course, responsability out of the main argument.

This movie easily ranks among the most famous and funny cult films ever made. The obvious flaws became the movie's signature, like the ""Frankenstein"" disguise (an outfit between  El Zorro and Darth Vader) and other production's bloopers and misscalculations, that turned this film in true Cult-Icon in bizarre and demented filmaking.

This DVD edition is the most complete and recommended, Uncut version with decent picture and sound quality, the extra material is the most complete available, and of course, the content is just one of the most entertaining and rare movies ever made.

Ah. Paul Bartel, what silly, silly films you made. Death Race 2000 is far and away the best of his feature-length releases, if only because the cheeseball factor here is cranked up so high the movie transcends its own cheesiness and becomes a sort of tasty, if bad for you, fondue-like substance that goes exceptionally well with, say, cheap alcohol.

The plot, for what it's worth: in the late seventies, the world went through a global economic collapse. The US government, in the spirit of offering its people bread and circuses and keeping the population down at the same time, instituted a road race in 1980 in which hit and run driving is not only not illegal, it's encouraged by the meting out of points to the drivers depending on the age and sex of the victim. (This inspired a video game so controversial that, last time I checked, only seven consoles still exist. I used to play it, back in the day.) A resistance group, opposed to the government's way of doing things, thinks that public attacks on the race's 2000 renewal will be the most effective way to strike at the current government. The 2000 race includes five contestants, including perennial favorite Frankenstein (John Carradine) and his main rival, Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (a young Sylvester Stallone). The bulk of the film, as you can probably guess, consists of the drivers trying to outrun one another, trying to avoid terrorist attacks, and trying to keep themselves covered. (What? Yes, two of the drivers are women, and both Frankenstein and Viterbo have attractive young women as their navigators, and all of them suffer that odd allergy to clothing one often finds among the women cast in movies directed by people who used to do things like Naughty Nurses.)

The script is terrible, the acting is bad, the whole thing is unintentionally hilarious. That said, it is hilarious, and that's the main reason to watch this movie. Well, that and spotting the John Landis cameo. ***",1201046400,,1994,4.824561403508772

There's a scene where he has food all over his face that actually caused me to laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of it.  The designs of the cars and the personalities of their drivers are also quite funny, especially the getup donned by David Carradine as Frankenstein.  You even get a little bit of social commentary on society's preclusion to violent sporting events and their use to pacify the masses.  And the epilogue?  I won't spoil it for anyone, but that was the last thing I expected at the end of a race movie where the goal is to run down as many victims as possible.

844394,5,6304238096,"Death Race 2000 is one of the greatest B-movies of all time. It's a low budget film that can only be summed up with the word...outstanding. The movie doesn't take much thought to watch, but it's very enjoyable. Death Race is set in a different timeline. After WWII, America is in charge of most of the world. One of the national sports is a racing event across America. Drivers are awarded points for not only finishing the race, but for running over pedestrians. The commentator for the race is great and the fact that racers get 100 points for hitting anyone over the age of 75 (normal aged people only 10-20 pts.) was a plus. The movie starts David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone, so I was a little surprised at the cast and the women for that time period are gorgeous. The design of the cars is original and awesome and when I stop to think about it, who wouldn't love a movie where one of the main racecar drivers has a rebuilt body and is named ""Frankenstein?""

844396,5,6304238096,"Its funny to think that people in 1975 thought life in 2000 would be so B. Apparently in 1975, blood of the future is red paint. Mowing down infants is a desireable action, and the national sport of choice would be the Death Race. In this enthralling sport portrayed in a true B flick, crushing someone's head under the wheel of your mid 70's american muscle car that looks nothing like a futuristic automobile is pretty much the zenith. Oh wait, these are all just aspects of the awful special effects in Death Race. How could we not love this film? Apparently Stallone followed his adult film up with this beaut. And, he delivered the goods in both. He gave us a halmark for a Sid the Elf Classic: terrible dialouge. Our favorite line from the Italian Stallion was:""I got two words for that Bull and..."" You know where its going.

If you couldn't tell from the previous paragraph, Death Race 2000 is a movie made in 1975, set in 2000 in a totalitarian state. The national pastime in the movie is not baseball, football, or basketball. They streched it even further than making it hockey. No, it is the Death Race, a cross-country car race in which contestants earn points for not only crossing the finish line first, but for running down people over the course of the race. Seriously, this is a pretty cool premise for a movie, eventhough this flick managed to come out extremely B.  Supposedly, the budget for this film was listed at $300,000. Sid thinks they actually spent $300 on the film, and Sly and David Carradine spent the rest partying.

But the film is worth checking out, for sure. It has a ton of hillarious attempts at special effects that are worth it alone. So, if you can watch the movie without expecting a lot, you may very well enjoy it. And, be honest, anytime a movie features someone's head being run over isn't it worth rolling the dice and popping it in? Sid thought so.",1182729600,,1897,4.524781341107872
844397,3,6304238096,"A friend of mine at work [who has been making an ALARMING number of good movie and music recommendations lately] rather insisted that I watch this movie, and so, at a moment of filmic indecision [Rhinestone, starring Sylvester Stallone and Dolly Parton, was next on my list], I threw this one up there and it was speedily delivered to me.

This movie was made in 1975 and takes place in 2000, which is obviously delightful. When we see a long matte shot of Manhattan, it's hard to believe anyone thought that all that building and addition of elevated monorails would have taken place in just 25 years--but it's charming. The rest of the movie mostly takes place in the desert, but there are a few ""futuristic"" buildings [circa 1975] driven by every now and then. This made me think that surely some movie is coming up soon that will take place in a world transformed by global warming.

This was apparently taken from a serious sci-fi novel, but when Roger Corman [that's right] thought about the elements he thought it would work better as a comedy that gradually moves into more serious satiric elements. We are at the Transcontinental Road Race, which is sort of a futuristic Cannonball Run, where the participants gain points by killing pedestrians, with children and old people scoring the most points. The credits are these pencil drawings of cool cars that look like something that cool guy in your 1975 math class would draw on the inside of his denim notebook, then we meet our contestants as they are interviewed by reporters. One reporter is this overexcited gay-seeming dude with Elvis glasses and hair [futuristic!], an irritating nasal voice and long scarf around his neck. There's also Grace Pander, a Rona Barrett-style entertainment reporter who claims to be ""a very dear friend"" of all the celebrities she covers. There's also a droll guy who speaks like Howard Cosell. Naturally it's occurring to me that a great many people reading this may be too young to know who these people are. Oh dear.

The notable racers are Sylvester Stallone [still couldn't avoid him, I guess] two years before Rocky, as the gangster-styled Machine Gun Joe, who drives a car with two machine guns and a giant knife attached to the hood. And, as the gay reporter says: ""Don't forget that swastika sweetheart, Matilda the Hun, with her Nazi navigator!"" We also meet John Carradine as Frankenstein, who dresses like a mix of Batman and Darth Vader, and who claims to be stitched together by so many various body parts. There's a funny moment [I mean, among ALL the funny moments] when Grace Pander leans in and asks Frankenstein to ""give me an exclusive,"" and then asks her question in front of all the other reporters. Also on hand is some Catherine Bach-type, apparently played by a former Warhol associate, who talks about the sexual satisfaction she gets from her navigator, some generic hunk smoking a cigar. Most of the other navigators are women, and it is explicitly presented that part of their responsibilities are in caring for the sexual needs of their drivers. Hey, it's Corman.

The President comes out to bless the proceedings--this is a federally-sponsored event--and hails a ""glorious day of minority privilege."" When I first heard this I thought he was referring to the way some people feel that minorities as we have come to think of them--blacks, gays, etc.,--are the recipient of ""privileges"" and special treatment, and I think this just comes from forgetting that this movie is 30 years old--and assuming that since it is ostensibly trashy it is politically located toward the right. Well, you know what they say about what happens when you assume.

So the racers go through Lincoln Tunnel and in seemingly five minutes are on this country mountain dirt road that looks remarkably like Northern California. I guess the environment really has changed. Then we divert to a group of rebels who feel that the race is a disgrace to the nation, and are led by a woman I believe is loosely patterned after Emma Goldman.

SPOILERS > > >

So then Frankenstein takes off his mask and we discover that he's really NOT hideously disfigured underneath. I just love the way that rolls off the tongue: Hideously Disfigured. Then Stallone machetes a guy's balls off with his car [turns out the guy, like everyone else here, bleeds fire engine red paint]. Then we see a bunch of old people lined up in the middle of the road, smiling, and we learn that this is ""euthanasia day."" Which is effectively disturbing. But Frankenstein avoids the elderly and diverts to hit what appears to be a line of nurses walking in a row, evenly spaced apart. I laughed heartily at a line about ""You should have taken the road I told you about, through the boy scout camp!"" Then at night all the drivers, who have apparently spread themselves out miles away from each other across the country, come back to one hotel to be rubbed down and interviewed. Is this not SO like The Cannonball Run?

That night Frankenstein goes over and says nothing to Stallone's navigator, but it looks like he said something, and Stallone comes and really punches her hard. Then Frankenstein's navigator, whose name is Sarah or Emma or something I can't remember now, offers her body to him and they get it on. Then the Frankenstein's ""biggest fan"" corners him in the hall downstairs... and tomorrow they're all back on the road again. We see that the big fan from the night before is outfitted in a white dress, standing in the middle of the road, eager to be killed by her idol. He obliges.

It goes on, but by now the novelty is starting to wear off a little bit. We start getting more resistance from the, well, resistance, which is immediately and hilariously blamed on the French. After not too long we have one of my favorite lines, just for it's simple directness: ""Stop the car!"" ""I can't... we're in a race!"" I'm not going to tell you the ending, although the phrase ""grenade hand"" does figure into it, and in the end Frankenstein becomes ""Mister President Frankenstein."" The guy at work who recommended this to me would reminisce about it, say ""Mister President Frankenstein"" to himself, and then just giggle.

< < < SPOILERS END

It sure is something. It's charming because it is SO absolutely adolescent, so entirely created to appeal to the base instincts of the 14-year-old boy in all of us, with the cool cars and the hot chicks and the violence and the guys getting it in the nuts... and most of all, the whole naughty concept of running over pedestrians for points. But through it all the movie remains more cheeky than offensive, mostly because the violence here is so cartoony. In most cases we don't actually SEE the car hit the person, we just see the car driving fast and then the person flipping up into the air. The blood is so red and fake-looking it's like something out of a small town Halloween haunted house. So it's mischievous and somewhat evil but in the most harmless and fun way.

But there's more than just cool fun in mind, because of the whole political satire aspects of it. Okay, it's really lame political satire [the government sponsors this race to keep the people placated, not too far away from the message of Rollerball], but there's something interesting about the way this movie starts out by generating viewer excitement with the whole idea of running over pedestrians, then widens so we see that this whole race is part of a larger government plan that involves sacrificing the country's citizens... it's vague and silly, but hey, they didn't have to add that element at all.",1182470400,,7588,4.740151515151515

Well, this race has quite a ""catch"" to it.  What if the objective were to run over as many people as possible between NY & CA?  What if there were cameras everywhere to ""keep score"" of how many people you flatten?

Well, that's the twisted story of DEATH RACE 2000.  It certainly has to rank  as one of the best ""B"" movies ever made.  Of course, it is a bit of a biting satire on the American love for violence.  As all good satires refrain from doing, however, it doesn't get ""preachy"" about things.  You're sure to surprise yourself at some of the scenes you'll find yourself laughing at.

This is the funniest role I've ever seen Sly Stallone portray.  He is a great fit as the Italian mobster.  David Carradine is good as the ""Frankenstein"" character.  The girls in the film are all pretty hot, and (a Corman trademark) they all take their clothes off @ one point or other.

844504,4,6304238096,"So these are the words of Calamity Jane, a contender in Roger Corman's low budget farce, ""Death Race 2000."" It is interesting that Amazon paired Corman's film with Norman Jewison's ""Rollerball"" and for good reason: one movie is pure satire and played strictly for laughs while the latter is a far more serious and somber commentary on the media, America's love affair with violence steeped in what we call ""sport,"" and the cult of celebrity. Both films explore these themes quite differently, yet both are entertaining as they are disturbing.

As a black comedy, ""Death Race 2000"" is more or less a cheaply made exploitation flick (budgeted at approximately $300,000), that never pretends for an instant to be anything more than a satire of the future and a parody of ""Rollerball""--a far more ambitious, absorbing and expensive film.

Corman's film  depicts a ""game""--the Transcontinental Death Race--designed to cater to society's need to channel its aggression and hostile impulses as sort of a 21st century equivalent of the Roman circus offering spectators both entertainment and a catharsis in its more manic and kinetic moments.

Yes, the film is crazy--from the attack on Frankenstein by the French Air Force to Thomasina Paine (hilarious!) and her revolutionaries' thwarted attempts to assassinate ""Mr. President"" and end the Transcontinental Death Race once and for all. While the special effects in Corman's film are decidedly low-rent, save for some interesting matte paintings injected at the beginning of the film, the cars themselves, customized by car designer James Powers, are both creative and imaginative. The film, for the most part is amusing and very funny. The ""Real Don Steele"" is terrific as the commentator with one-liners that will leave you laughing.

While Carradine's ""Frankenstein"" looks utterly ridiculous in a plastic helmet and a vinyl body suit, a pre-Rocky, Sylvester Stallone steals the show and seems far more comfortable in the role of ""Machine-Gun Joe Viturbo."" Stallone would be a household name a year later with ""Rocky"" released in 1976. Before he assumed his US Senate seat representing his home state of Iowa, a bespectacled Fred Grandy, preceding his ""Love Boat"" debut on ABC, also manages some laughs as ""Herman the German.""

This DVD release with its extras and commentary is a vast improvement over the Digital Multimedia release that looks like it was pirated-off someone's VHS copy recorded in EP mode. For Corman fans, this would appear to be the release to shoot for.

844573,5,6304238096,"Finally, fans of Death Race 2000 can enjoy this satirical film in the original widescreen format (1.78:1).  My compliments to Buena Vista Entertainment for making the effort to release this film in the format that originally graced theaters and drive-ins in 1975.  Not only do the pulse-pounding car race scenes benefit from this, but also the ""cramped"" dialogue sequences between Annie & Frankenstein are loosened up.  Paul Bartel's great direction - not to mention the 2nd unit direction of the race sequences - is really on display here:  no longer hacked up in a full-frame format, it's really quite a slick picture.  The widescreen presentation really pays off in the flick when the 5 racers initally split up (at about the 10:40 mark) and especially in Calamity Jane's bloodthirsty pursuit of Matilda the Hun (after Matilda's scoring of Jane's navigator).  Of course, the explosions benefit immensely as well.

The 10-minute featurette with Roger Corman, Mary Woronov, Martin Kove, and writer Charles Griffith are enlightening, especially Kove's description of his effeminate depiction of Nero the Hero.  What is obviously missing, though, are comments from Sylvester Stallone & David Carradine.  I'd also have loved to have Roberta Collins' & Fred Grandy's take on the film (odds of that are no better than a snowball's chance in h***, but one can dream can't he?).

844695,4,6304238096,"This Corman classic from the 1970s is a real treasure for lovers of cheesy movies. The plot concerns a transcontinental race in which drivers score by driving fast and killing pedestrians. The principals are David Carradine as ""Frankenstein,"" versus Sylvester Stallone as the pink-tie wearing villain. This movie is so schlock that it must be seen to be believed, and even though it involves ridiculous looking cars running over people, it is cheery in an odd way that only Corman and director Paul Bartel could pull off.

This film was made for about $300,000 and it shows. Everything about it reeks of cheese. The cars especially are absolutely ludicrous, as are the sets, the occasional animation, the script, and the acting. There is even a subplot about American revolutionaries led by Thomasina Paine and Frankenstein becoming the new President, whose first ruling is rather controversial.

Please feel free to detest the annoying television announcer who narrates a largish portion of the film. He is effectively dealt with by Frankenstein in a most satisfactory manner. I would have given the film three stars, but I upgraded my evaluation to four stars exclusively because the script constantly blames the French for all that is wrong in the world (hence the title of my review).

He is the fan-fave of a futuristic totalitarian America. The violence, carnage, and stunt work of the car races at times becomes cartoony to the point of being funny and hilarious.  Think if the Hanson Brothers from SLAP SHOT got into race cars... that's how funny it is.  The vehicles in the film are as much as the stars in this film as their drivers.  Each car has a personality and distinctive ""killing"" style/shape of their own and they look pretty cool too.

844698,5,6304238096,"I loved this movie, actually caught it at a drive-in theater back in 1975, not that long after getting my drivers license. David Carradine, fresh from the cancelled Kung Fu television series, played Frankenstein, a master driver, rumored to be half cyborg.  This movies motivation was all about the anti-establishment, post Vietnam War era, and reflected the prevailing attitudes against US Imperialism.  Seems a little ironic it takes place in 2000, with our return to that sort of attitude in government today.
In about 1978, just before the launch of the video game Space Invaders, the most popular arcade game in America was Death Race.  You chased little stick figures (they called them gremlins... but you know :) ) with a car, and ran them down.  They squealed, turned into crosses, (tombstones that is) you would hit reverse, and keep driving.  At the end of the game, your score was the number killed.  The moms of America were outraged at the game, and later a version was modified, (They renamed it Demolition Derby) you were chasing cars, which then turned into wrecks.  In a nutshell, the original game is the plot of the movie Death Race 2000.
The movie is about a national sporting event, apparently to show that life is cheap, and only the meanest SOB wins.  Racers get varied degrees of points, for mowing down pedestrians in a cross-country, racing event.  A pre-Rocky Sly Stallone plays the main competition for Frankie.  Carradine handles the role with just the right amount of campy acting, and without going too far overboard. While some of this stuff plays like an episode of the Road Runner, they never lose the spirit of the film, so it comes off well.
Believe it or not, some of the race itself is very exciting.  For a low budget film that was probably made in a week or two, the action sequences were well thought out.  The politics may be a little preaching at times in the film, but don't really get in the way of the fun.  My five star rating, does not mean I think this is on par with past Oscar winners.  What it means is, that for this type of low budget, camp movie, I consider it a classic along the lines of Motel Hell, Little Shop of Horrors, Harold and Maude, and Easy Rider.",1070409600,,2214,4.600508905852418
844699,2,6304238096,"This is a very silly movie that hasn't aged well since its release in 1975. It has aspirations of being a clever social satire, but it's really just low-brow entertainment, often not too far removed from the ""Skinimax"" flicks of the late-80's. That may be a good thing if you're into cult flicks and B-movies, but for most viewers this is too cheesy to even be mildly amusing.
In ""Death Race 2000"", David Carradine stars as national hero and veteran racer Frankenstein, while Sylvester Stallone plays Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, his biggest competitor. They compete against three other drivers in a transcontinental road race where extra points can be earned by running over pedestrians. One by one, the five cars fall victim to a group of rebels who are intent on putting a stop to the gruesome sport.
The violence, of which there is very little, is played for comedic effect. However I think the intended reaction was more along the lines of ""oh man, that was BRUTAL, haha!"" rather than ""oh man, that looked so cheap, haha!"" Low budget film-lovers rejoice! This is your movie.
Interested parties should be prepared for Carradine's ""dominatrix"" outfit, complete with mask and cape. I think it was supposed to make him look sinister, but instead he comes off looking rail-thin and ridiculous. Stallone, in a supporting role as a stereotypical Italian tough guy, steals the movie.
The beautiful supporting actresses also overshadow the star, Carradine. Anyone familiar with producer Roger Corman knows that, in his world, fast cars and gratuitous violence go hand in hand with bare-breasts and the occasional catfight. ""Death Race 2000"" is no exception.
If you've seen this before and decided it's your type of film, then this is definitely version to get. Stay clear of the 1998 release by Digital Multimedia, a very poor transfer with blurry, grainy images and an ever-present hiss. This 1999 release by New Horizons looks infinitely better and the sound has been digitally re-mastered.

The film is filmed beautifully, especially when the cars are on the road. There's a lot of action as the cars run over people for points and battle each other to win the race.
The biggest regret I have about this DVD is that it is not in widescreen. This is a shame because, well, if it isn't in widescreen, you are being cheated. And this great film deserves to be in widescreen. (Let the VHS fans have the fullscreen.) Some deleted scenes would have been nice as well, as I have seen photos of action not in the final print, and even in the trailer on the DVD there is a line not in the film (""This is a death race,"" as said by Frankenstein).

844773,2,6304238096,"Death Race 2000 can be summed up neatly in a single sentence: It is a post-apocalyptic ...B racing movie.  I can't deny that I enjoy the movie, but let's face it, it really stinks.  The storyline alone is laughable: in the future, a corrupt American president rules the country from abroad, providing ""bread and circuses"" to the masses in the form of violent entertainment.  Our hero, Frankenstein (David Carradine), is an iconic part of it all.  He's the #1 driver in a cross-country road race in which killing pedestrians is rewarded with points.  Stallone pays Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, Frankenstein's ruthless nemesis who will -- gasp! -- do anything to win!  The race is plagued by pro-democracy rebels who want to sabotage the violence with their own violence, and kidnap Frankenstein to coerce the government into democratic reforms.  Oh yes, it's one of those bloodthirsty, pro-democracy guerilla groups!  But Frankenstein has reasons for wanting to win that go beyond the glory of fame . . . .  The reasons don't make much sense, but I won't spoil it by giving them away.
Stallone's acting actually steals the show -- he's an above-average actor in a far below-average move.  He even makes it look credible when skinny-armed, slow-moving Carradine, who punches like a 12 year old girl, beats him up.
...Actually, the movie's dialogue, sets and acting are very, very amateurish.  ... The satire is thin, the humor is virtually non-existent (except for some pretty hard and well-justified whacks at the media), and characters have not the slightest bit of depth or logic.  There are a lot of scenes involving gratuitous nudity (exclusively of women) and characters will sleep with their mortal enemies, try to kill them and then (literally) five minutes later embrace them lovingly, etc.  I particularly like the scene where a saboteur tries to drive Frankenstein off a cliff and, as soon as he stops her, he gets out of the car (leaving her in control of the car), walks to the edge of a cliff directly in front of the car, and stand there contemplating the universe.  Instead of finishing the job and killing him, the saboteur follows him and gives him a hug.
That said, the cars themselves are very imaginative and there is good action.  Some of the special effects are well above par for a B-grade movie like this one.  And, for all the terrible acting, [bad] script and silly plot, there is just enough fun in it to make your typical low-brow action-loving American, such as myself, sit still through 90 minutes of it.  On the other hand, my wife, who is not a non-low-brow, non-action-loving American, found it utterly to lack redeeming value.",1024444800,16,2655,4.851441241685144

As usual with all of Roger Corman's cult classic collections, the disc is loaded with extras, interviews with Corman, members of the cast and crew, audio commentarys, trailers, tv spots and a 12 page booklet.  For the Classic Roger Corman fan, this is a must!!",1518739200,,1302,5.286407766990291
