922734,4,6304749805,"This recording is an absolute delight, and has to represent the best value for your DVD dollar available anywhere today. Filmed in 1995, (4x3 format, Playable in all Regions) it features Artists of The Ballet of The Slovak National Theatre and Children of The Dance Conservatory, Bratislava with music by the Sofia National Opera Orchestra. The role of Clara is danced by Nora Gallovicova, and The Nutcracker by Jozef Dolinsky (who choreographed this production and is also the company's Ballet Master).
This is not the great ""tour de force"" production that you would expect from some of the better known international companies that have the facility to solve a problem by simply throwing more money at it, but rather a prime example of a company maintaining its integrity by utilising the available resources at its disposal, and combining it with the enthusiasm of the dancers and students to produce a very `human' ballet that I found absolutely charming and still thoroughly enjoyable after 10 viewings over a 3 week period.
It obviously pressed all the right buttons for me, so I guess the bottom line has to be; Should you buy a copy of this disk? No, you should buy two. Keep one to enjoy yourself and give the other as a gift. The extra 10 bucks is hardly likely to break the budget, and with the extra royalties going into the company's kitty, maybe we'll be lucky enough to see more of them in the future.",1077321600,49,1416,4.7368421052631575
922735,5,6304749805,"This is a great interactive video! My three year old just jumped right in after watching it through once and started trying the steps. My five year old put on a little ""show"" for mummy and daddy. She performed the Sugar Plum Fairy Dance for us. I highly recommend this video. It has cute kids who appear to be actual ballet students. The ballet teacher is easy for children to follow. She and the characters from the Nutcracker teach your children the steps to the Nutcracker Ballet. My children loved it.",1006387200,6,505,4.56043956043956

7877058,3,6304749805,"We weren't crazy about this version.  Some of the costumes were nice, but the dancers and music lacked excitement.  We'll order another version for the next Christmas.",1391817600,,167,5.148148148148148
7877059,1,6304749805,"The dancers are lovely and well rehearsed, talented, etc., but this is probably the worst choreography and overall version of The Nutcracker that I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot!)  There are so many other Nutcracker dvds out there- if you're in the market to get a dvd to watch at home, pick a different one!",1388102400,,316,4.3559322033898304
7877060,5,6304749805,"very well done with children and adults performers, all will love it. the children are wonderfull especially the mischievious  boy mice. I have seen many versions, but this one is a favorite.",1360454400,,191,4.96875
7877061,5,6304749805,This ballet is enjoyable to both adults and children (of all ages!).  It is colorful and snappy and should not be missed.,1357171200,,121,4.5
7877062,5,6304749805,The tape arrived in great shape in a timely way to my mother who is an invalid.  She absolutely adored it and asks to see it over and over again.  This has brought great delight to her days.,1354752000,,190,3.973684210526316
7877063,4,6304749805,"I bought this video when I was dancing as Herr Droselmeyer in the Maryland Ballet Theater's annual production of the Nutcracker. I bought several ""Nutcracker"" videos over the years to compare techniques. This is a nice traditional version of the ballet. No longer a ballerina - too old. But I still enjoy the video at Christmas.",1307664000,5,328,4.875
7877064,5,6304749805,I originally saw this production on VHS and have been searching for the DVD.  It is not as elaborate as some of the other productions with all the special effects but the dancing is outstanding and the interpretation of the ballet is very good.  I would recommend this for anyone.,1167696000,12,280,4.58
7877065,2,6304749805,"I have to admit i am not very pleased with my purchase. I recently saw this ballet in my country, Turkey, and i liked it so much i wanted a copy of the Nutcracker. However, when i recieved this Slovakian copy, i realized the version i saw in Turkey was a renewed version and way more entertaining. The players in this show dance and act according to the original play written 150 years ago. Plus, the stage and decorations are appalling. There is no fairy coming out of the chimney or there is no christmas tree that is supposed to increase in size in mid-play. (becasue all the actors in the play are actually toys - duh!)

Costumes and lighting is not so good either. In the Egypt scene, number of dancers is reduced from three to one. And what a hideous dancer that one is.

In short, if you want to see the Nutcracker played good, this one is not it. Scout more and find a better copy. That is what i'll do.",1142812800,18,911,4.2298850574712645
7877066,1,6304749805,"Although the concept is great, it is ruined by amateurish filming & reproduction. Color changes for no reason,the camera focuses on the wrong things, the sound is tinny -- it is an embarrassment! The young dancers do well & may inspire others -- but the story is ""told"" sketchily, omitting most of the first act of the ballet.",1100649600,3,326,4.637931034482759
