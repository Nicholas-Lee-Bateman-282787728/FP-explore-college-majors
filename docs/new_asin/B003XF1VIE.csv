8408041,4,B003XF1VIE,"Fuzzy Settles Down, 1944 film

The story begins in a small town where men walk on the street. Fuzzy stops at a bank. There is a shot and two men ride away. Fuzzy pursues them to their cabin hideout. Then the two men chase Fuzzy. A rider meets Fuzzy and joins in the gunfight. The two bank robbers are outsmarted and caught. In the town of Red Rock the people want to protect themselves against passing outlaws. A telegraph line will allow them to contact the sheriff and get news. Somebody shoots the newspaper publisher. Fuzzy plans to buy a small business and settle down. Maybe a local newspaper? There is an auction for the newspaper. Fuzzy is the high bidder. There is a sore loser, but Billy reasons with him. Miss Martin offers to help run the paper. The outlaws are in control of the county.

Fuzzy visits the tavern for a beer. There is conflict, Billy stops it. A peaceable life? Lafe drops by for a chat with Fuzzy. ""Good Luck."" A handbill calls the ranchers for a meeting to organize resistance to the outlaws. The local gang leader plans to end it. Billy stands guard and captures a would-be arsonist. Will he talk? Who broke the lantern? Will Fuzzy be in danger when he fetches supplies in a wagon? Can Billy help him? The ranchers raise $10,000 to finish the telegraph line. Billy worries about Fuzzy. But the robbers kidnapped Fuzzy and stole the money. Lafe stirs up people against Fuzzy. Billy finds the stolen money and asks the robber to name the leader; he will. There is a showdown in the tavern. The wrinkles are ironed out so justice triumphs. Billy decides its time to move on; so does Fuzzy. Miss Edith is now the owner.

Building a telegraph line will also benefit the newspaper by bringing news for its four-page newspaper. Newspapers then were a small business, not part of a corporate chain that tells people what to think. [Notice how people put trust in the printed word over the rumors on talk radio?] This is a good story for a low-budget film Other films had heroes who worked for justice then drifted on. You wonder how they earned a living.

Al St. John began in silent film comedies and worked with Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. He provided comic relief and the conversations needed to keep the audience aware of the story. One fault in these films is how nobody suspected the big rancher as the leader of the gang. This creates drama, but I suspect that wouldn't occur in the real world. The lesson in this story is how a big corporation wants to take over and control the Free Press.",1283040000,,2528,4.513100436681222
