8402081,5,B003PXSBVO,"THE ALAMO is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. THE ALAMO is one of our nation's greatest cinematic icons of ""Film Americana"" ever made. Through word, song and picture the legend of the Alamo was handed down and stills lives today. Men and women of different religious, ethnic and social backgrounds came together and died or lost loved ones at the Alamo in a noble effort to overcome tyranny and preserve basic human freedoms. John Wayne preserved that legend on film. John Wayne produced, directed and starred in this epic mixing nobility with bawdiness resulting in a reverence for the ideals of the defenders seen through their personal lives and conduct. The cast, script, production design and score added to the richly textured look and feel to the film. John Wayne is effective in his portrayal of Col. David Crockett. However, John Wayne takes a back seat to the brilliant performances of Laurence Harvey as Col. William Travis and Richard Widmark as Col. James Bowie as they feud and bicker over the virtues of military protocol vs. military expedience. Wayne in turn approaches the role of Crockett as the levelheaded onlooker who interjects this legend with passages of homespun witticism to keep the defenders from losing focus of their reason for being there. Cinematographer William Clothier's images are proud and majestic depicting the honor of the defenders. James Edward Grant's script is intelligent, energetic and moving. Equally energetic and moving is the eloquent and multi-textured score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Tiomkin's scoring of the final battle scene is brilliant and highly overlooked. Tiomkin integrates the nobility of the combatants with the fervor of the conflict and with simple queues he emotionally captures the falling of each defender in a brief moment of reflection as the battle rages on. His song ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" is beautiful, reflective and haunting and is effectively integrated into the context of why the defenders gave their lives. THE ALAMO thanks to John Wayne's determination and insight to what drives the American spirit.

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is probably one of the best and most widely known and remembered Spaghetti Westerns ever produced. Arguably, this may also be Sergio Leone's directorial masterpiece of that genre. The film's narrative flow, visual style, script, music, acting, cinematography and even the dubbing and sound effects make for one cohesive artistic statement. So much has been said about this film that it is virtually impossible to say anything more. Yet, there is always room for more. One element that always astonished me was how the film manages to take a somewhat little known campaign of the Civil War at Glorietta Pass in New Mexico and use that as the backdrop of this fascinating film.",1345680000,,2802,5.064935064935065
