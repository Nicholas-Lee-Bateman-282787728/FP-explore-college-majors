3051139,4,B0010V60XO,"This is a fun and energetic workout.  At best it is moderate in intesity, but I did get my heart rate up in this 40 minute video (30 min workout and 10 min for warm up and cool down).  The set is the same as the set for some later Turbo Jam videos and some of the moves remind me of Chalene's moves in Turbo Jam, but simpler.  All in all it's a fun mix of simple dance, but if you are a big Turbo Jam fan like I am (or Turbo Kick as it's called in the gyms), it's not quite as good.  If you have no idea what I'm referring to with ""Turbo Jam,"" then definitely check this out - Crunch videos are a lot cheaper than the Turbo Jam series and these types of workouts are a lot of fun, so much so I'd recommend them to everyone!  Great music, kickboxing, and dance :)  This instructor is energetic too and her cueing is good.  An experienced exerciser will find these to be relatively easy but fun while a beginner may find it fun to include dance without difficult choreography.",1203897600,9,974,4.041666666666667
3051140,3,B0010V60XO,"The kickboxing part of this workout is excellent - easy to follow but great for getting your heartrate up.  However, I personally found the dance moves in it to be distracting and annoying - stuff college age girls would probably have fun doing.  I tried to ignore it and just do some classic exercise moves during the dance parts like jogging in place or side steps so that I could just get through the workout, but eventually got tired of hearing the instructor yell out over and over again, ""Come on, girls - touch yourself!!!""
  I have half a dozen other Crunch workouts that I love and I was really excited to see them release one for kickboxing, but sadly, overall I really found this to be a disappointment.  I'd highly recommend someone rent this and try it out before buying it.",1203638400,29,787,4.514084507042254
3051141,4,B0010V60XO,"I like this because it's fun and energetic and it makes you want to move.  It's only about a half hour of cardio (then there's the warm up and cool down as well) so it's the perfect amount of time you need to be getting your heart rate up.
Jeanette is really outgoing and encouraging and she cues well in this.  You mix kickboxing and Jamaican style island dance to get a really funky workout.  It kind of intervals for you so once you've done a tough segment of kickboxing, you can take it a little easier with a slower dance section.  It's really calorie burning with the combination of powerful kickboxing combos and dance moves to follow.
I found this to be a lot of fun and as a result, the half hour goes by really quickly while you end up working up a true sweat.  I highly recommend this to people who like intervals and want to burn heaps of calories.  It's fun and not too challenging.",1201132800,22,895,4.266272189349112
3051142,5,B0010V60XO,"I picked up the early release of this dvd from a local retailer and in my opinion, this is the best Crunch has done in a long time.  I always enjoy Crunch workouts for their fun factor.
The dvd is a mix of uncomplicated kickboxing and dance moves.  It has the classic Crunch set and background exercisers in colorful outfits.  The music is upbeat and the instructor is good.
Several of the background exercisers are annoying and whoop and holler a little much, but I can ignore this.  If that bothers you, you probably don't like other Crunch videos either and would probably steer clear of this one anyway.
All in all, a great exercise and I worked up a sweat.  The moves are not complicated.
A keeper.",1200528000,30,703,4.4609375
3051183,5,B0010V60XO,"A well done dvd. I enjoy the workout and can feel it the next day. It's not high impact, but just right for me.",1428883200,,111,3.6666666666666665
3051184,5,B0010V60XO,"First of all, I like to consider myself a Workout DVD connoisseur :)  I have a generous collection and I would consider this one of my new favorites. Jeanette is fun, funny, and full of energy. You can tell she enjoys what she is doing. I think the combo of cardio dance and kickboxing makes it more interesting. The moves aren't too difficult, but aren't so easy that it's boring. I don't even mind the warm-up and cool-down (many workouts have long, drawn-out ones that get old fast, and are entirely too lengthy).
As far as the cardio part goes, it gets your heart rate up,  but nothing like Turbo Fire or the original Insanity. It's fairly low impact, but for the most part, Workouts are only as intense as you make them. Once you get the routine down, you can really exaggerate the moves and put a lot into them.
That's just my two cents. :)",1425081600,,846,4.382165605095541
3051185,3,B0010V60XO,It is a good work out but if you have no rhythm it is hard and not funl Too many dancey moves and not just straight up boxing moves.,1424217600,,132,3.586206896551724
3051186,5,B0010V60XO,"I have been doing Zumba for over 2 years now and was looking for something a little different but just as much fun.  This dvd is really good.  I sweat, dance, kick, punch and jump until I sweat.  Jeanette has a great personality so that definitely helps.  With the winters here in Boston being so cold and brutal, I needed something like this on those days that I can't or don't want to go to the gym.  Great workout video; I highly recommend.",1421280000,,443,4.289156626506024

3051190,3,B0010V60XO,It's fun but a little too much dancing for me.,1415750400,,46,3.7
3051191,2,B0010V60XO,"I thought that it would be a great fun workout, a nice mix of kickboxing and dancing.  Well, my biggest problem was following along.  The first time I did it, i had a very hard time following the moves and I thought maybe it was b/c I was uncoordinated.  But I think it had to do with too many people on the dvd to watch and the constant moving from one to another to another person instead of staying on one person for the whole combo; No one looked the same doing each move and that confused me.
I even had a very coordinated friend who used to be a pom pom girl do it with me and she had a hard time following it.  I also didn't think it was very super charged.  I know moving around and belly dancing, hip swaying can be a good workout, but not supercharged.  I felt like nothing was really worked and i barely broke a sweat.  And I sweat EASILY.  This one is going to get sold back, if possible.",1403049600,,900,4.01685393258427
3051192,5,B0010V60XO,"So I didn't do the review immediately..
I waited almost a month...and Jeanette Jenkins. ..she been doing this!!! I got her new stuff. ..so I expected this to be an  old , boring, and weak workout....Tuh!  She brings it! There are a few dance moves incorporated to make it kinda intense. You will work up a sweat....and don't worry its not kick boxing like u training for a fight...lol its fun easy and it works! My stomach is almost flat..love handles gone and my thighs gave a gap...lol  get u some! I wish I had taken measurements...but I've lost 8 lbs I was an 11/12 now I'm in a straight 9.....9/10 is to big....I could get 7/8 but I'll wait until the 4th of July!",1401408000,,668,4.328
3051213,5,B0010V60XO,I really love this DVD. It's fun and gives you a great calorie burn. It's pretty dancy but that's one of the things I love about it. Jeanette is great and I will definitely try more of her products.,1400457600,,198,4.102564102564102
3051214,5,B0010V60XO,"I've done this workout about 4 times now, and still don't have all the moves down. The instructor is awesome, I feel great after I'm done. I hi g holy recommend this DVD.",1393632000,,170,4.181818181818182
3051215,3,B0010V60XO,It's just OK. The dance steps and kickboxing just don't go together--not a smooth transition from one aspect to another,1391817600,,119,5.0
3051216,5,B0010V60XO,I reviewed a small piece of this video and really liked it. I haven't used it yet because I tend to use the machines at the gym more. I can't wait it try it. I workout a little bit and really liked it.,1391472000,,201,3.697674418604651
3051217,2,B0010V60XO,Honestly I regret yhis purchase.  I keep trying to do the workout but can't get past the first 10 minutes! Im a fitness instructor. I workout 7 days a week but this really requires u to have dance back ground. It should be called dance party. Not the kickboxing workout I hoped for,1391040000,,281,4.30188679245283

Thank you.",1384214400,,105,4.3
3051221,5,B0010V60XO,"I might have 100 workout DVDs and this is my favorite.  Definitely gets your heart rate up and feels like a real cardio workout, but in only 40-45 minutes.  It's also a lot of fun - I find myself bouncing through the moves, instead of trudging.  I like the mix of dance and kickboxing, so it doesn't feel too silly or too serious.  Fun and effective workout!!!",1370044800,,360,4.3283582089552235
3051222,3,B0010V60XO,"I saw a video review on this and it looked like lots of fun. But after buying it and trying it out, there was no fun. There was no trouble with me keeping up with the choreography. I just did not think that this workout was fun at all.

I would not recommend this at all, and it does not work up much of a sweat.",1369008000,2,312,3.727272727272727
3051253,5,B0010V60XO,"Very thorough workout.  Jeanette brings you up so that you comfortably move into a good pace.  I get a really good sweat out of it and she mixes up the routine really well.  A good workout and not a killer, wipe you out workout.  You will not get bored with this one.",1367020800,,267,4.076923076923077

3051255,5,B0010V60XO,"I got this dvd today and its really fun! It's kind of fast paced and she doesn't go through that moves more than once or twice, but you catch on quick. I'd recommend watching it once and then trying it or you won't get anything from the work out!",1364256000,,246,4.040816326530612
3051256,4,B0010V60XO,"I was happily surprised by how fun & light-hearted this video is.  It is not highly intense so I use it on the days that I feel I don't have a ton of energy for a long, strenous workout.  It does combine dance moves with the kickboxing but that's what makes it fun and different from other typical kickbox videos. And the dance moves are simple and easy to follow. If you are looking for a high impact sweat dripping workout than granted this is not the video for you.  Just keep an open mind and have fun with it.  Who cares if you don't get the moves right away, no one is watching.  Also, you cannot beat the price, a real value.",1361318400,,632,4.105691056910569

3051258,5,B0010V60XO,"This is a great, quick workout DVD.  It is not super intense but you will feel like you had some exercise. It's fun, moves quickly and the instructor is high energy.  She'd be a great instructor in person.  I liked the mix of kickboxing and dance--it was different than your basic kickboxing class.",1361059200,2,298,4.584905660377358

3051260,2,B0010V60XO,"I was looking for a DVD that had me work as hard as I work in a kickboxing class. This is NOT it!  I barely got my heart rate up.  I typically LOVE Dancie workout videos, they're my first choice, but I did not appreciate the dance/kickbox mix.  Very disappointed.  Still looking for a good intense kickbox DVD.",1298332800,2,310,4.293103448275862
3051261,5,B0010V60XO,"I recently purchased this in a 3 pack of exercise/cardio videos from Amazon, and it is the most fun that I've ever had (doing workouts from a video). The instructor is hilarious, and it gives you a great all around workout. I enjoy using my 2 lbs wrist weights to get more of an upper body workout. I also appreciate that the instructor emphasizes having fun and enjoying yourself while you shake it! There is a big tall goofy looking guy in the back of the class of women, and he shakes his stuff too! haha. It is a moderate-high intensity workout, well worth the money!",1297555200,2,571,4.39622641509434
3051262,5,B0010V60XO,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD.  It gave me one of the best workouts I've had in a long time. It's become my go-to workout.

I highly recommend this to lose weight fast!!!!",1296950400,3,343,3.9565217391304346
3051273,4,B0010V60XO,"I received this as a gift from a friend who absolutely loves this video. I must say the first few times it totally kicked my butt and I almost gave it up because I thought it was past my skill level. But it gets easier, instructor is fun and energetic (though one girl behind her really annoys me, personal pet peeve though :o)  )  A solid workout",1289606400,,347,4.164179104477612
3051274,3,B0010V60XO,"I just used this DVD for the first time and enjoyed it.  I am about 12kg over weight, out of condition (and over 40) and today am quite sore from resistance exercises done yesterday.

It got my heart rate up and isn't that hard to follow although I couldn't finish it. Although it wasn't possible to get the moves first time I feel that after another six or so sessions I'll get them mostly right (I don't like lots of fancy steps - and am not good at them).  I like the dancy moves but since I have never been to a kick box class I can't make a comparison. Didn't find the instructor annoying like some people did.

If you are a beginner and don't have tons of room to spring about, this is a good DVD. Would be a bit better if the music volume was a bit louder. Glad I bought it.",1284940800,,781,4.019354838709678
3051275,2,B0010V60XO,"I'm an experience kickboxer and a fairly experienced dancer.  Having said that, I thought that this DVD provided an awkward combination of the two.  The dance moves did not blend in well with the kickboxing moves, and if anything, they detracted from the intensity of the workout.  What's more, Ms. Jenkins had a certain sassy quality in her instruction that was distracting at best, and frequently annoying.

The workout was not very intense either.  To my mind, it was pretty much the worst of both worlds.  If you're new to exercise or to kickboxing, you'd probably want a straight-up kickboxing workout.  If you're more experienced though, then this DVD probably won't do much to raise your heart rate.  I'd check out something else.",1283731200,3,737,4.934959349593496
3051276,4,B0010V60XO,"I own seven Crunch videos and this is probably my favorite.  It's not so hard that I can't do the whole thing, but it does challenge me and cause me to break a sweat.  This video incorporates some dance moves, but the sequences are primarily kickboxing-based.  There's nothing especially difficult about the sequences, but you are constantly moving and, thus, it's a good cardio workout.  The music is kind of generic, but in a good way that is not distracting.  Some reviewers had negative things to say about the instructor.  I, however, think she is entertaining and has a good sense of humor.  If you take yourself seriously during your workouts, this video probably isn't for you.  But if you want to have some fun while you break a sweat,  give Super-Charged Kickbox Party a try.",1274745600,,785,4.713235294117647
3051277,5,B0010V60XO,"I've never actually seen another workout like this that combines both dancing and kickboxing into one workout, but I love it!  This is a workout DVD that is about intermediate level led by Jeanette Jenkins.  It is pretty high cardio and it adds some dance moves to make it a little bit more.  There are 5 segments which are about 7 minutes each, and each of these segments has a 1 or 2 kickboxing combos with 1 or 2 dance combos.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought the dance and kickboxing combos were blended well together.  The kickboxing combos are usually made up of jabs, cross punches, front kicks, knee thrusts, side kicks, roundhouse kicks, jump kicks, and back kicks.  Jeanette also expects you to already know all of these punches and kicks.  Jeanette will break down the harder kickboxing combos slowly enough times to get it, but not long enough to lower your heart rate.  Also, there are modifications for some of the higher impact movements (such as the jump kick) that you can choose to do instead.  The dance combos consist of relatively easy steps such as a V-step with chest pumps, heel and toe taps, and hip rolls.  Once again, the more complex moves Jeanette breaks down 1 or 2 times, but your heart rate shouldn't go down.  The pace is pretty fast, and besides slowing down about 3 times to teach a tougher kickboxing/dance combo, she will never slow down.  The warm-up starts out with some plies and reaches, then moves into some punches and kicks before slowing down for some stretching.  The cool down takes on a Latin feel as Jeanette does some Mambo and Cha-Cha dance moves before doing some more stretching.  Overall, this is a very fun workout that is pretty intense and fun to do, and I look forward to doing it every time I pull it out!",1272499200,3,1766,4.565079365079365
3051278,5,B0010V60XO,"I really enjoy doing this workout.  It is a great alternative for the days when I need to recover from a strenuous workout.  The workout combines kickboxing with dance moves that keep you entertained while you exercise.  It shows how to use very simple dance moves to achieve optimal results without all the complicated choreography.  There is a lot of dancing in this video so if you are not looking for a dancing tape you may want to skip this one.  If dancing is your style then you will certainly get a kick out of this video.
Jeanette is energetic as usual and cues very well.  I find her style very motivating without being overly annoying like other instructors.  This is perfect for all exercisers although advanced may find this a little too easy.  I simply use weighted gloves to add resistance to the moves.  You will burn a ton of calories and enjoy yourself in the process.  The time will go by before you know it.",1268352000,3,927,4.497005988023952
3051279,3,B0010V60XO,This DVD is a good workout but for people who haven't taken dance lessons it is challenging.  You really have to stop and watch the DVD to get the steps right for some of the dance moves.  Not as good as the Pilates Crunch DVD that I purchased.,1243555200,2,244,4.0625
3051280,3,B0010V60XO,"I'm an intermediate-level kickboxing junkie coming out of a 2-month fitness hiatus. This DVD was fun and really helped me get my mojo back. But it's not challenging enough to  keep me sweating in the long term.

I also have to agree with some of the other reviews. For me,the combination of kickboxing and dance was awkward. I spent more time perfecting sashays than working up a good sweat, and the kickboxing elements were pretty sparse.

Overall, if you're a beginner looking for a fun dance DVD, this one will do (and introduce you to some light kickboxing moves in the process). But if your less interested in choreography than kickboxing, stick with Billy Blanks.",1235779200,,669,4.8

She incorporates fun dance moves into her kickboxing routine, and even has you do jump kicks (but of course you don't have to if you're not ready to do that yet), which I find tons of fun. This video hasn't gotten old for me yet. I've used it lots of times now. I would recommend it highly.
Oh, and one more thing. It has gotten a little easy but I just make sure I put more effort into it. Also, I do this when I want a little easier of a workout cause I'm tired or sore. It's still nice to have around even once you get more fit.",1221782400,,561,3.9298245614035086

3051307,2,B0010V60XO,"Jeanette Jenkins is a favorite of mine, but this workout did not cut it. The warm up was excellent, I felt prepared for an intense workout. Yet I became more and more disappointed as the video went on, as the majority of it was ridiculous dance moves with very little actual kick boxing. I also experienced little cardiovascular benefit. I wear a heart rate monitor and I was barely above 92bpm for the entire workout. My target is between 160bpm and 175bpm. This video may be good for someone who is new to exercise or maybe has a hard time with strenuous workouts, but for someone in good physical condition, it's mostly a waste of time.",1217808000,9,639,4.517241379310345
3051308,3,B0010V60XO,"I enjoyed the kickboxing segments, but really didn't like the dance segments that went with them. When I'm doing kickboxing I much prefer to stick with straight on kickboxing, not throw dance moves in the middle of it.

I did feel bad for the one guy in the whole group of exercisers. Especially with the hip rolls, the ""touch yourself"" v-steps and the booty shaking island dancing segments. He seemed to just roll with it though. One of the girls right behind Jeannette was a little too sexual in some of her dance moves. I don't mind when the background people put their own style into the moves, but this chick was downright distracting. It looked to me like she was trying to attract the attention of someone off screen.

Other than that, it's not a bad work out if you don't mind mixing up your kickboxing with dancing.",1211068800,3,824,4.523489932885906

3051310,5,B0010V60XO,"I own 5 of the Crunch series DVDs and this is my favorite.  Jeanette has an infectious enthusiasm, which makes it impossible not to have fun during this workout.  The DVD consists of a warm-up, 5 kickboxing combos, and a cool-down.  All of the segments are short, which makes the workout fly by.  The 5th combo is slightly longer, but arguably the most fun.  The choreography is an excellent mixture of dancing and kickboxing.  The dance moves are simplistic, and do not require coordination.  The kickboxing moves are not overly-complicated, but do require a moderate level of coordination.  Jeanette does an great job of showing the moves at half-time without dragging out the demonstration for so long that it becomes boring once you learn the video.  When high-impact moves (jumping jacks and jump kicks) are incorporated, there is one dancer who consistently demonstrates the low-impact version.  Additionally, the cueing is right on throughout the DVD.  I find the stretching moves in the cool-down slightly difficult and uncomfortable, but not enough to keep me from performing the moves. My only complaint about this DVD as a plus-size (fit!) woman is that all the dancers have very thin bodies.  Generally, the Crunch series casts a racially diverse group of dancers with varying body types.  The dancers for this DVD are racially diverse, but the body type diversity is missing.  I would recommend this DVD for beginning or intermediate excercisers with at least some coordination.  If you're and advanced excerciser, you may think this video is too easy.",1206835200,12,1565,5.08235294117647
3051311,4,B0010V60XO,"I have enjoyed this workout... I am very fit and workout everyday, and I find this video to be a nice alternative to traditional cardio. I did the video once and found that it worked muscles that I usually don't work - I felt a little tightness around the abs and hip flexors the next day!

The pace of the workout is pretty fast, and there are some complex combinations that require good coordination. If you are a person that can pick up choreography quickly, you won't have a problem after the first or second viewing. Lower-impact alternatives are shown for some high-impact moves like jacks, etc.

Jeanette is a good instructor, and has a nice energy throughout. The alternating cardio boxing and dance segments make the time go by quickly too! I like high-intensity cardio, and I would rate this to be mid-intensity... won't use it everyday, but it could be a great warmup for a short run or even a good workout for lighter days. A good addition to your Crunch collection!",1206489600,8,978,4.614942528735632

The moves were too slow to get my heart rate up enough for a solid, fat burning workout. I'll stick with Amy Bento's Kickbox Xtreme or her new CIA 2805 for my intense workouts, and save this one for when I'm not feeling my best and want something easy. As an instructor, however, Jeanette Jenkins is fun, energetic, and easy to follow.",1206403200,7,541,4.705263157894737

At best it is moderate in intesity, but I did get my heart rate up in this 40 minute video (30 min workout and 10 min for warm up and cool down).  The set is the same as the set for some later Turbo Jam videos and some of the moves remind me of Chalene's moves in Turbo Jam, but simpler.  All in all it's a fun mix of simple dance, but if you are a big Turbo Jam fan like I am (or Turbo Kick as it's called in the gyms), it's not quite as good.  If you have no idea what I'm referring to with ""Turbo Jam,"" then definitely check this out - Crunch videos are a lot cheaper than the Turbo Jam series and these types of workouts are a lot of fun, so much so I'd recommend them to everyone!  Great music, kickboxing, and dance :)  This instructor is energetic too and her cueing is good.  An experienced exerciser will find these to be relatively easy but fun while a beginner may find it fun to include dance without difficult choreography.",1203897600,9,974,4.041666666666667

However, I personally found the dance moves in it to be distracting and annoying - stuff college age girls would probably have fun doing.  I tried to ignore it and just do some classic exercise moves during the dance parts like jogging in place or side steps so that I could just get through the workout, but eventually got tired of hearing the instructor yell out over and over again, ""Come on, girls - touch yourself!!!""

3285638,4,B0010V60XO,"I like this because it's fun and energetic and it makes you want to move.  It's only about a half hour of cardio (then there's the warm up and cool down as well) so it's the perfect amount of time you need to be getting your heart rate up.
Jeanette is really outgoing and encouraging and she cues well in this.  You mix kickboxing and Jamaican style island dance to get a really funky workout.  It kind of intervals for you so once you've done a tough segment of kickboxing, you can take it a little easier with a slower dance section.  It's really calorie burning with the combination of powerful kickboxing combos and dance moves to follow.
I found this to be a lot of fun and as a result, the half hour goes by really quickly while you end up working up a true sweat.  I highly recommend this to people who like intervals and want to burn heaps of calories.  It's fun and not too challenging.",1201132800,22,895,4.266272189349112

The dvd is a mix of uncomplicated kickboxing and dance moves.  It has the classic Crunch set and background exercisers in colorful outfits.  The music is upbeat and the instructor is good.
Several of the background exercisers are annoying and whoop and holler a little much, but I can ignore this.  If that bothers you, you probably don't like other Crunch videos either and would probably steer clear of this one anyway.
All in all, a great exercise and I worked up a sweat.  The moves are not complicated.

Jeanette is fun, funny, and full of energy. You can tell she enjoys what she is doing. I think the combo of cardio dance and kickboxing makes it more interesting. The moves aren't too difficult, but aren't so easy that it's boring. I don't even mind the warm-up and cool-down (many workouts have long, drawn-out ones that get old fast, and are entirely too lengthy).
As far as the cardio part goes, it gets your heart rate up,  but nothing like Turbo Fire or the original Insanity. It's fairly low impact, but for the most part, Workouts are only as intense as you make them. Once you get the routine down, you can really exaggerate the moves and put a lot into them.

The first time I did it, i had a very hard time following the moves and I thought maybe it was b/c I was uncoordinated.  But I think it had to do with too many people on the dvd to watch and the constant moving from one to another to another person instead of staying on one person for the whole combo; No one looked the same doing each move and that confused me.
I even had a very coordinated friend who used to be a pom pom girl do it with me and she had a hard time following it.  I also didn't think it was very super charged.  I know moving around and belly dancing, hip swaying can be a good workout, but not supercharged.  I felt like nothing was really worked and i barely broke a sweat.  And I sweat EASILY.

Although it wasn't possible to get the moves first time I feel that after another six or so sessions I'll get them mostly right (I don't like lots of fancy steps - and am not good at them).  I like the dancy moves but since I have never been to a kick box class I can't make a comparison. Didn't find the instructor annoying like some people did.

The dance moves did not blend in well with the kickboxing moves, and if anything, they detracted from the intensity of the workout.  What's more, Ms. Jenkins had a certain sassy quality in her instruction that was distracting at best, and frequently annoying.

The workout was not very intense either.  To my mind, it was pretty much the worst of both worlds.  If you're new to exercise or to kickboxing, you'd probably want a straight-up kickboxing workout.  If you're more experienced though, then this DVD probably won't do much to raise your heart rate.  I'd check out something else.",1283731200,3,737,4.934959349593496

There's nothing especially difficult about the sequences, but you are constantly moving and, thus, it's a good cardio workout.  The music is kind of generic, but in a good way that is not distracting.  Some reviewers had negative things to say about the instructor.

This is a workout DVD that is about intermediate level led by Jeanette Jenkins.  It is pretty high cardio and it adds some dance moves to make it a little bit more.  There are 5 segments which are about 7 minutes each, and each of these segments has a 1 or 2 kickboxing combos with 1 or 2 dance combos.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought the dance and kickboxing combos were blended well together.  The kickboxing combos are usually made up of jabs, cross punches, front kicks, knee thrusts, side kicks, roundhouse kicks, jump kicks, and back kicks.  Jeanette also expects you to already know all of these punches and kicks.  Jeanette will break down the harder kickboxing combos slowly enough times to get it, but not long enough to lower your heart rate.  Also, there are modifications for some of the higher impact movements (such as the jump kick) that you can choose to do instead.  The dance combos consist of relatively easy steps such as a V-step with chest pumps, heel and toe taps, and hip rolls.  Once again, the more complex moves Jeanette breaks down 1 or 2 times, but your heart rate shouldn't go down.  The pace is pretty fast, and besides slowing down about 3 times to teach a tougher kickboxing/dance combo, she will never slow down.  The warm-up starts out with some plies and reaches, then moves into some punches and kicks before slowing down for some stretching.  The cool down takes on a Latin feel as Jeanette does some Mambo and Cha-Cha dance moves before doing some more stretching.  Overall, this is a very fun workout that is pretty intense and fun to do, and I look forward to doing it every time I pull it out!",1272499200,3,1766,4.565079365079365

There is a lot of dancing in this video so if you are not looking for a dancing tape you may want to skip this one.  If dancing is your style then you will certainly get a kick out of this video.
Jeanette is energetic as usual and cues very well.  I find her style very motivating without being overly annoying like other instructors.

I also have to agree with some of the other reviews. For me,the combination of kickboxing and dance was awkward. I spent more time perfecting sashays than working up a good sweat, and the kickboxing elements were pretty sparse.

3285803,4,B0010V60XO,"I do the Firm and Prevention, so I consider myself intermediate.  I find the moves on this in line with the others I mentioned.  Theres alot of kickboxing, with combo moves and some mild dancing.  Her cueing is the best I've seen.  You won't go wrong with this one.",1220745600,,265,4.346938775510204
3285804,2,B0010V60XO,"Jeanette Jenkins is a favorite of mine, but this workout did not cut it. The warm up was excellent, I felt prepared for an intense workout. Yet I became more and more disappointed as the video went on, as the majority of it was ridiculous dance moves with very little actual kick boxing. I also experienced little cardiovascular benefit. I wear a heart rate monitor and I was barely above 92bpm for the entire workout. My target is between 160bpm and 175bpm. This video may be good for someone who is new to exercise or maybe has a hard time with strenuous workouts, but for someone in good physical condition, it's mostly a waste of time.",1217808000,9,639,4.517241379310345
3285805,3,B0010V60XO,"I enjoyed the kickboxing segments, but really didn't like the dance segments that went with them. When I'm doing kickboxing I much prefer to stick with straight on kickboxing, not throw dance moves in the middle of it.

I did feel bad for the one guy in the whole group of exercisers. Especially with the hip rolls, the ""touch yourself"" v-steps and the booty shaking island dancing segments. He seemed to just roll with it though. One of the girls right behind Jeannette was a little too sexual in some of her dance moves. I don't mind when the background people put their own style into the moves, but this chick was downright distracting. It looked to me like she was trying to attract the attention of someone off screen.

Other than that, it's not a bad work out if you don't mind mixing up your kickboxing with dancing.",1211068800,3,824,4.523489932885906
3285806,4,B0010V60XO,This workout makes you sweat.  Today is my first day of doing the workout and it makes you sore aftering do it.  She explaines things very well and you do an example workouts then she will bring it up to tempo.,1208131200,4,210,4.097560975609756
3285807,5,B0010V60XO,"I own 5 of the Crunch series DVDs and this is my favorite.  Jeanette has an infectious enthusiasm, which makes it impossible not to have fun during this workout.  The DVD consists of a warm-up, 5 kickboxing combos, and a cool-down.  All of the segments are short, which makes the workout fly by.  The 5th combo is slightly longer, but arguably the most fun.  The choreography is an excellent mixture of dancing and kickboxing.  The dance moves are simplistic, and do not require coordination.  The kickboxing moves are not overly-complicated, but do require a moderate level of coordination.  Jeanette does an great job of showing the moves at half-time without dragging out the demonstration for so long that it becomes boring once you learn the video.  When high-impact moves (jumping jacks and jump kicks) are incorporated, there is one dancer who consistently demonstrates the low-impact version.  Additionally, the cueing is right on throughout the DVD.  I find the stretching moves in the cool-down slightly difficult and uncomfortable, but not enough to keep me from performing the moves. My only complaint about this DVD as a plus-size (fit!) woman is that all the dancers have very thin bodies.  Generally, the Crunch series casts a racially diverse group of dancers with varying body types.  The dancers for this DVD are racially diverse, but the body type diversity is missing.  I would recommend this DVD for beginning or intermediate excercisers with at least some coordination.  If you're and advanced excerciser, you may think this video is too easy.",1206835200,12,1565,5.08235294117647
3285808,4,B0010V60XO,"I have enjoyed this workout... I am very fit and workout everyday, and I find this video to be a nice alternative to traditional cardio. I did the video once and found that it worked muscles that I usually don't work - I felt a little tightness around the abs and hip flexors the next day!

The pace of the workout is pretty fast, and there are some complex combinations that require good coordination. If you are a person that can pick up choreography quickly, you won't have a problem after the first or second viewing. Lower-impact alternatives are shown for some high-impact moves like jacks, etc.

Jeanette is a good instructor, and has a nice energy throughout. The alternating cardio boxing and dance segments make the time go by quickly too! I like high-intensity cardio, and I would rate this to be mid-intensity... won't use it everyday, but it could be a great warmup for a short run or even a good workout for lighter days. A good addition to your Crunch collection!",1206489600,8,978,4.614942528735632
3285809,3,B0010V60XO,"This workout would be fine for someone new to kickboxing or someone who has reached an intermediate fitness level, but for an advanced level fitness enthusiast such myself, it simply wasn't intense enough. The moves were too slow to get my heart rate up enough for a solid, fat burning workout. I'll stick with Amy Bento's Kickbox Xtreme or her new CIA 2805 for my intense workouts, and save this one for when I'm not feeling my best and want something easy. As an instructor, however, Jeanette Jenkins is fun, energetic, and easy to follow.",1206403200,7,541,4.705263157894737
