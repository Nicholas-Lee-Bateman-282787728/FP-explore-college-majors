678753,3,6303560105,"""The Princess Comes Across"", was supposedly inspired by true events, but nothing in the film seems believeable, and that's one of the biggest faults of the harmless 1930s film.

  Carole Lombard plays an out of work actress who is posing as the princess of Sweden, who has signed a movie deal. Fred MacMurray plays a band leader who falls for the princess. As the plot develops a murder happens and MacMurray and Lombard are the prime suspects.

 The material, at least to me, sounds like the makings for a comedy. Think along the lines of a Bob Hope film, say ""The Great Lover"", but no, the movie is cover to all of its bases and it a half comedy (mostly in the beginning), half suspense, half romance. Speaking of Bob Hope the film was written by Don Hartman and Frank Butler, two men who actually wrote for Hope. The movie also brings to mind Preston Sturges' ""The Lady Eve"". Both films have characters who are not what they appear. Barbara Stanwyck was playing a con artist who passed herself off as a good girl, and Lombard as the actress playing a princess. But at least with ""The Great Lover"", which also has a mystery storyline on a ocean liner, and ""The Lady Eve"" they played their material correctly. Each film set the correct tone. ""The Princess Comes Across"" could have used a few rewrites. It needed to make up its mind on what exactly it wanted to be. Since MacMurray and Lombard were so successful in ""Hands Across the Table"", a charming 30s screwball comedy, why not try to repeat that success?

 I'm recommending the movie mostly to those who enjoy classic Hollywood films. Of course if you're a fan of the stars it doesn't hurt either. Lombard and MacMurray are fine, and can be quite funny and charming when the film allows them to be.

 Bottom-line: Weak comedy\romance\suspense film that never sets the right tone. The actors do their best to keep things going, but the screenwriters sure made things difficult for them.",1112486400,,1941,4.619186046511628
678754,4,6303560105,"Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray co-star in this swell screwball comedy in which Lombard, a down and out American actor posing as European royalty, comes up against MacMurray, a brash, wisecracking big band musician who casts a cynical eye on her masquerade.  They, um, fall in love eventually, (duh!) but the hijinks and sharp quips in between are quite enjoyable.  A classic!  Plus, you get a chance to see MacMurray portray a tough guy, as well as sing and play the concertina!  Lombard is a total dish, too.",1064102400,,512,4.784090909090909

THE PRICESS COMES ACROSS adroidly combined a whodunit by Philip MacDonald with a romantic comedy novel by Louis Lucien Rogger, to give Lombard and MacMurray and delicious successor to their previous 1935 hit HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE. It took six writers to make up a brilliant script (for once, too many cooks didn't make hash!) Carole is a Brooklyn showgirl who took a third-class trip to Europe from which she returns first-class.............On the way back to the states, Carole assumes the idenity of a Swedish princess in the hopes of being discovered as a new Garbo! A zany comedy thriller with plenty of jokes has our Carole pose as royalty on an ocean voyage on a luxury liner where she meets romantic MacMurray; they soon become embroiled in a whodunit! This deft blend of satire, comedy and mystery is interesting for Lombard's obvious poke at Garbo and there's William (Fred Mertz) Frawley in rare form as Benton. William K. Howard directed Arthur Hornblow Jr.'s production and kept things skimming along at a fine rate of knots - to top it off, MacMurray even sings a little ditty entitled MY CONCERTINA.",958694400,7,1149,4.86734693877551

7849961,5,6303560105,"There goes the Mammoth, a luxury steamship casting off the port of Le Havre, bound for New York. On board: a Swedish royal, a randy bandleader, and a slippery murderer, three principals in this bent comedy caper from 1936. Princess Olga (Carole Lombard) is going to Hollywood to try her hand at acting in a movie what's based on the distinguished novel, Lavender & Old Lace, except Hollywood, being Hollywood, the title of the movie is She Done Him Plenty. Odds are, the princess is a natural in the acting biz. After all, she's already playing a bit of pretend. You'll see.

What an eventful ocean voyage for the princess! Trying to have fun despite the restrictions imposed by her draconian lady-in-waiting (Alison Skipworth). Propositioned by King Mantell (Fred MacMurray), an amorous American bandleader and dismissed by a certain lady-in-waiting as nothing more than a wretched ""concertina squeezer."" Inconvenienced by a blackmailer who knows her dirty secret. All the while in perilous proximity to a cold-blooded killer.

Also onboard are five significant police officials enroute to an international convention of detectives in New York. Their leisurely passage is interrupted by a message from the police headquarters in Paris that alerts them that notorious French criminal Paul Merko, who had been condemned to the guillotine, had broken out of prison two days ago and is suspected of being onboard the ship. Paul Merko speaks seven languages and is a master of disguise. And since no one is quite sure of what he looks like, there go the five international coppers all in a tizzy.

The Princess Comes Across makes for delightful viewing. It's the second of four films that co-starred Lombard and MacMurray, not that it was first intended that way. Carole Lombard was such a fantastic person, widely known for her bawdiness and fearlessness and for her generosity towards her friends and her film crews. She gained enormous pull after the success of her 1934 classic comedy, 20th Century, with her new contract giving her approval over script, director, and co-stars. Lombard originally offered the male lead role to George Raft, a pal of hers that had been going thru a career slump at the time. It's only when Raft turned the role down that it was offered to MacMurray. No shade at Raft, whom I only know from gangster pictures, but it's tough picturing him in a farcical setting.

The movie starts off as a full-blown frothy comedy but then segues into a lighthearted B-movie murder mystery. The Princess Comes Across proves yet again that Lombard and MacMurray were a winning team. Their scenes together are great. Both leads demonstrate natural comic timing. For fans of I Love Lucy, there's a sighting of a decades-younger William Frawley as King Mantell's sticky-fingered sidekick Benton.

The other three movies Lombard and MacMurray did together? Hands Across the Table (1935); Swing High, Swing Low(1937); and True Confession(1937). If True Confession isn't my favorite of the four, then it must be The Princess Comes Across. I had so much fun watching this movie. The plot delivers a fair share of skullduggery, a flavor that accents the great mood of the movie. Proving that he's not a one-trick-pony, MacMurray plays ""Flight of the Bumblebees"" on the concertina and then airs out his pipes as he belts out ""My Concertina."" This one ticks off plenty of boxes: Music, hijinks, deception, romance, murder. All in all, a terrific little movie.",1507334400,,3463,5.026132404181185

7849964,4,6303560105,"Carole Lombard's effervescent charm elevates this otherwise-minor 1936 screwball comedy.  In THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS, Lombard boards an ocean-liner and winds up in the middle of a series of hijinks and murder on the high seas - with Fred MacMurray, Alison Skipworth and William Frawley in strong support.

The press is abuzz with the news of Olga, a glamorous Swedish princess, sailing to America in order to star in a movie of ""Lavender and Old Lace"", but which shall be re-titled ""She Done Him Plenty"", according to Olga's lady-in-waiting, Gertrude (Alison Skipworth).  But there's one little secret... Olga isn't a princess, nor is she Swedish.  Rather, Olga is Wanda Nash, an American showgirl desperate for fame and driven to impersonating obscure Swedish royalty in a last-ditch bid to make her dream a reality.

She almost gets away with it, until a blackmailer tracks her to the ship and is later found dead in her bed.  Luckily for the princess, the ship is also carrying a contingent of international police detectives - not to mention world-famous ""concertina squeezer"" King Mantell (Fred MacMurray), who promptly falls for the comely damsel in distress.

Sporting a merciless ""Greta Garbo"" accent and swathed in dreamy Travis Banton fashions, Carole Lombard is utterly adorable in this film, sharing the bill with frequent leading man Fred MacMurray, one of her few co-stars who knew how to handle her unique comedy style.  The film itself is a featherlight affair, very sparkly and silly - if you enjoy screwball comedies you'll adore it.

Directed by William K. Howard

Our mystery comedy begins something like this, Wanda Nash (Carole Lombard) is an alluring Swedish beauty who travels under the name of Princess Olga. Everyone whom she meets en route to America on the steamship Mammoth bows and scrapes to the Princess, while Hollywood anxiously awaits her arrival to star her in a big-budget film. Only the ship's band leader, King Mantell (Fred MacMurray), refuses to defer to Olga, sensing that she may not be all she claims. Mantell's instincts are right on target: the ""Princess"" is a phony, a Brooklyn girl who has adopted a royal guise thanks to drama coach Lady Gertrude Allwyn (Alison Skipworth) - its a publicity stunt. Unfortunately, blackmailer Darcy (Porter Hall) becomes aware of Wanda's true identity and offers to keep quiet in exchange for a huge cash settlement.

At the same time, Darcy is attempting to shake down several other passengers on the Mammoth, including King Mantell. Inevitably, Darcy is found murdered in the Princess's stateroom, and Wanda finds herself one of several likely suspects, among them Mantell. A quintet of international detectives, traveling to a convention in America, sets out to solve the mystery, which becomes even more mysterious when one of the detectives also turns up dead. Taking matters in his own hands, Mantell vows to clear Wanda's name, and in the course of things he realizes that he's madly in love with her - but will Wanda give up her hoax, and her future showbiz career, for Mantell's sake?

There is much chemistry between Lombard and MacMurray, who both could play drama and comedy, only a handful of actors can do both.

* Special footnote: - George Raft initially was cast as Carole Lombard's co-star, but he walked off the set at the start of production. He objected to Ted Tetzlaff as the cinematographer.

7849967,4,6303560105,"Following their success together in HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE, Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray team up again in this light entertainment about making it in Hollywood, solving a murder mystery, and falling in love. Lombard disguises herself as a Swedish princess, and while aboard an ocean liner she not only meets handsome bandleader MacMurray, but is blackmailed by an old acquaintance. When the guy ends up dead in Lombard's stateroom, she goes to MacMurray for help. He finds the killer and, of course, falls in love with Lombard. Her ruse is revealed by the end, which makes everything normal again. The story and direction just zip right along and whether ""getting to know each other"" or working on the murder mystery, the two principals are fun to watch. The whole picture is as light as a feather, but it's not a slipshod affair, and it works so well because everyone involved wants it to. Worth a watch.",1150502400,3,910,4.802547770700637

A journalist, an average dame disguised as a Swedish princess, and a group of detectives sail together not knowing their paths will cross, but when blackmail and murder occur, they're all linked together.

This film is advertised as a comedy, but it is more of a romantic drama than anything else. There are times of wit, but the mystery of the murder and figuring out which characters are innocent and which are guilty is more dominant. There is also a decent love story between the reporter (Fred MacMurray) and the princess (Carole Lombard).

These two leading actors are good in this film, but not great. MacMurray outshines the accented Lombard who has always been slightly overrated as a comedienne, in my eyes. She is certainly beautiful and the two make a handsome couple and a fun film.",1144886400,,869,4.786666666666667
7849969,5,6303560105,"The 1930's gave birth to a hybrid type of film which mixed comedy and mystery with a certain type of glamour. Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray have fun in this splendid example of the genre fans will enjoy. Based on a story by Philip MacDonald adapted from a novel, there are many amusing moments as the irreverent and lovely Lombard spoofs Garbo. The versatile Fred MacMurray matches her as a smitten concertina player trying to protect her when things go south.

Lombard is Wanda Nash of Brooklyn, posing as a Swedish Princess, Olga, and heading for Hollywood by ocean liner to star in a film for Transcontinental Pictures. Alison Skipworth is her traveling companion, Lady Gertrude. A cabin mix-up has them meeting concertina player King Mantell (MacMurray) and his pal William Frawley, of I Love Lucy fame. There is an instant attraction between the two, but Lady Gertrude is afraid Wanda will slip up and ruin the charade if she and Mantell hook up. As she explains to Wanda: ""No good ever comes from a concertina squeezer!""

An escaped murderer who is a master of disguise is on board the ship, but luckily for the captain, an international convention of police detectives, which includes Mischa Auer as a Russian cop, is along on the cruise as well. When a slimy blackmailer named Darcy ends up dead in Wanda's cabin, the vulnerable Princess turns to King Mantell and his pal to get her out of the jam. King, on the verge of big success but with a shady past also, throws caution to the wind and moves the body.

It isn't long, of course, until King is on to the Princess, but by this time he has fallen for her, and puts himself in danger by announcing he will reveal the killer after his concert. Can any good come from a concertina player? It's fun to find out in this somewhat tame but very entertaining film. The sets are delicious and so is Lombard. The camera shows off her beauty while the story gives her a chance to poke a little fun at the `nose up in the air' variety of prestiege star popular during the 1930's. A fun little film and a must for Lombard fans.",1112486400,5,2079,4.523936170212766
