8205701,5,B000NIS44S,"The 6 DVDs of THE COMPLETE WWII FILM LIBRARY are stored in three cases (as shown). As with most Historical Archives products, quality here is quite good. Producers of these shorts are primarily U.S. government departments, with some from major and indie studios.

This collection offers many rarities available nowhere else, such as War Dept. footage of post-blast Hiroshima and Nagasaki, films designed for industrial plant managers, detention camp documentaries and histories of new war weapons.
