2638152,5,B000HIVIOM,"I have purchased all 4 of the Bewitched seasons that are out, I am anxiously waiting for the rest of the series to come out as well, these shows are timeless, I have a 4 year old who enjoys them as much as I do, and I know that the content is wholesome enough for him to watch! I loved Bewitched as a kid and I still love it as an adult!",1168300800,3,337,3.6944444444444446
2638153,4,B000HIVIOM,"I really liked Season 1-3 better than the fourth Season and rest of the seasons because Daren (Dick York) did not have as many roles in Season 4, and in some shows he was never seen. It seemed lonely without Daren in the shows and because of his back problems that is why he was so absent in both Season's 4-5, and later replaced with (Dick Sargent) in season 6, who unfortunately does not have a good connection with (Elizabeth Montgomery) as Dick York had. Bewitched ratings went down hill fast when Dick York left the show! Bewitched Season 4 still has some really good shows but in the middle/end you will notice that Daren was missing from the show for no explanation or was out of town, and the roles that he had were smaller.",1167782400,6,732,4.389705882352941
2638154,5,B000HIVIOM,"The fourth season of ""Bewitched"" is a delight.  The series had established a universe of characters so that they had an excellent variety & balance by the fourth season.  Several episodes were written with Darren away on business, presumably because Dick York was increasingly suffering from back problems.  I thought that my favorite character Aunt Clara was well represented in episodes like ""McTavish"" where her warlock boyfriend Aucky buys a haunted castle that requires Samantha to zap over to England just as Darrin's parents are vacationing there.  One professional reviewer did write, ""Conspicuous by her absence throughout most of season four is Marion Lorne as 'Sam's' befuddled Aunt Clara, whose magical spells somehow always go awry. Seriously ill and suffering from a rapidly failing memory, the 84-year-old Marion Lorne was forced to severely cut back her work load; the actress died just after filming wrapped for the season, on May 9, 1968.""  While I didn't feel an absence of Clara because of great episodes like ""Out of Sync, Out of Mind"" where Clara's spell throws Samantha's voice out of whack & ""Samantha's Thanksgiving to Remember"" where the Stevens & Gladys Kravitz get whisked back to Plymouth.  I also enjoy how the producers seemed to develop an ensemble cast such as bringing Craig Hunley back as a neighbor boy who wants to mow Darrin's lawn.  On another season's episode, he'd been an orphan that Samantha takes to the North Pole to prove there is a Santa Claus and in another he played the young Darrin Stevens.  On of the silliest episodes for the great Agnes Morehead was ""Once in a Vial"" where she drinks a love potion and then gets lovey-dovey.  Elizabeth Montgomery is a delightful comedienne with great double takes, confusion and continual surprise.  While Sony might have put a bit more information about the show in the packaging or on the extras, this is an excellent DVD set.  Enjoy!",1163894400,13,1924,4.98125
2638155,5,B000HIVIOM,I like Elizabeh Montgomery any thing she did. The show is very funny and and allot fun to watch. Both Darren's and the Endora made the show complete. I like the way they all fit in as show and as players. I like Bewitched best over both the Munster and The Addams Family of the same period.,1163030400,4,290,4.105263157894737
2638156,5,B000HIVIOM,"Well, here we are, another great season if Bewitched. This season is classic. From the lovable Uncle Aurther to Wonderful Aunt Clara, This season is really funny. This season has such great episodes as: The first Thanksgiving. Where Aunt Clara transports the Stevens clan & Gladys Kravitz back in time to the first Thanksgiving with the pilgrams. Another fine episode is Mc Tavish, Where Sam goes to England to get rid of a pesty ghost. One of my favorites is the flying saucer. Aunt Clara changes a little toy flying saucer into a real flying saucer with martians on board, that look like dogs. These are all clasic shows that can never be replaced, no matter how hard anyone tries. They will live in our hearts for a long time to come. Our Childrens Children will probably be watching these long after we are all gone. I haven't had any problems with my discs either. They all play great. The CC works good also.",1162512000,12,914,4.579268292682927
2638157,5,B000HIVIOM,I bought Bewitched season 4 off of Amazon and there is nothing wrong with mine and I know of a few people that bought this set from different places and there are no problems with theirs either! Bewitched season 4 is a great season with an episode for every holiday!,1162166400,3,266,4.34
2638158,1,B000HIVIOM,"Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the ""menu"" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned ""off."" The only way to avoid this is to choose ""other"" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues?",1161820800,5,786,4.581560283687943
2638159,5,B000HIVIOM,"I know that there are Bewitched fans who love the first two B&W seasons the best well Im one who enjoys the color seasons after Tabitha's magic develops the best. This season has some of my personal funniest episodes. The Halloween episode this season is in my opinion the best Halloween episode from this or any other TV Sitcom ever! I LOVE the chase around the house that Sam does when chasin after those spooks Tabitha zapped out of her book. And then when one of the spooks turns Gladys Kravitz's nephew in to a goat it is so funny how he baaas her name ""aunt gllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddyyyyyyyyyyysssss""! Gladys is also funny on that episode. Plus I LOVED the bull dog episode when Tabitha changed that bully into a bulldog. This season and the Fifth season were my two favorites. I just hope they continue and release the fifth season as well as the sixth thru the final season which is the eight season. I can't add much more that none of the other reviews haven't said except I agree with most of their comments... Why doesn't TV air these anymore? We pay so much each month for dish and cable? It makes me so angry the way TV Networks air the same series on different channels.  Why can't some of these TV channels drop some of those same old shows that we can see on other channels and add Bewitched back on?!!",1161129600,21,1332,4.5041322314049586
2638160,5,B000HIVIOM,"I was so glad that BEWITCHED is being released on DVD, yes I am buying them and season 4 is being purchased without question.

ANYWAY.....what is the deal with DVD sets of TV shows, and why isn't cable not showing these old TV shows afterhours? After midnight people who pay for cable or satellite are having to view INFOMERCIALS....AAAUUGHH!! Cable channels can feature old sitcoms, if any studio exec reads this offer old programs to these cable channels. On nights when I cant sleep, have to get up early for work or coming home from a binger, I don't want someone trying to get me to buy a real estate guide or some magic ball that cleans my laundry. I would like to see BEWITCHED at 2 in the morning, or JEANNIE at 3 in the morning, you get the idea......",1158451200,15,760,4.390070921985815
2638161,5,B000HIVIOM,"Much can be said about Bewitched's 4th season.  I believe the series peaked here.  They introduced a whole slew of new sound effects, some of which remained until the end of the series.  Sam's identical cousin, Serena, began making semi-regular appearances during this season. Dr. Bombay appears a few times also. His character was fully developed from the word GO. Also, this was the final season we see Aunt Clara prior to Marion Lorne's passing away.  (They should have at least given an explanation about her absence in season 5).

Some of the best episodes here include ""Double Double Toil and Trouble"" where we first see Serena terrorizing Darrin while pretending to be Samantha.  Also, ""I Confess"" has Sam showing Darrin, via dream, what would happen if they told the world Sam's true identity.  Another classic is ""Allergic to Macedonian Dodo Birds"" has Endora losing her powers only to be a bigger terror to Darrin than ever before.  This is also the only season to film a Thanksgiving episode where aunt Clara zaps the gang back to the first Thanksgiving...a holiday must-see.  Oh, and let us not forget Samantha being crowned Queen of the Witches.  They came up with this idea, then didn't know what to do with it, so they quietly seemed to drop it.  It was mentioned halfway through the season, then not ever again acknowledged that it ever happened until the beginning of season 7.

Although we don't see Tabitha too many times at the very start of the season, she pulls some very funny story lines with her powers as the season progresses including conjuring up Prince Charming out of a fairy tale, turning a spoiled brat of a neighbor into a bulldog, and zapping up strange-looking spooks out of a halloween book.  The second episode was devoted to Tabitha turning her dolls and stuffed animals into live beings, but if you look and listen closely, it is very obvious that episode was filmed for season 3, but wasn't aired until the beginning of season 4.

My only complaint about this season was that if someone were tuning into episodes like ""Business Italian Style"" or ""Cheap, Cheap"" and they never have seen the show before, they would come to the conclusion that the Stephens' were childless.  That always bugged me, but that has always been a television affliction.  We are always to assume kids are asleep, in their rooms, out back, etc while the action is going on.  Just watch ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" or ""I Love Lucy"" and you'll know what I mean.

There were a couple of lousy episodes including ""Majority of One"" and the episode that introduced a nanny, but never materialized after that.  But thankfully, with modern DVD's, you don't even have to fastforward over them.  Just click which episode you want to see, and it appears.  Samantha and Tabitha would have said that the mortals were catching up with them.

But every show has episodes that are subpar, and quirks.  But the superior character development, original storylines and superior acting makes Bewitched a show for all-time.  Many shows in the sixties were not terribly well acted, especially the police dramas.  But many of the sitcoms like Bewitched, Jeannie, the Flying Nun, That Girl, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies, Get Smart, all had top rate actors and storylines.  This is why they remain a staple in our culture to this day.",1156118400,100,3326,4.821869488536155

2638269,4,B000HIVIOM,"This was a light-hearted funny family comedy - packed with magic.  The magic practiced here comes in three varieties.

The easiest magic to perform is wish-craft.  For Samantha and her daughter Tabitha, they only need to twitch their noses while making a wish and shazam - its done;  for the others, they use simple hand gestures with their wishes.  Sometimes it doesn't work, and they must go to the next level.

Traditionally witches perform their magic by casting a rhyming spell.  The incantation must be exactly right or the spell will fail ( a frequent issue for the dotty Aunt Clara.)  Another problem:  a witch can't undo another witch's spell ( an issue Samantha frequently has with her mother's spells.)

The third variety of magic, is perhaps not really magic but the art of making potions.  Dr. Bombay, Samantha's family physician, is most practiced in this.  ( Believe it or not, witches can get sick too, like losing their powers.)

What can they do?  Pop people, animals, and objects from place to place.  Remotely move objects such as a chair or a wall!  Change people into objects ( walking chair) or animals ( talking raven) or change objects or drawings into pseudo living beings from toys ( soldier) or drawings ( jack-o'-lantern.)  Levitate themselves or others.  Make themselves invisible to non-witches.  Manipulate time by locally freezing or reversing it,  view alternate timelines ( Darrin's life without Samantha), or travel back in time.

Lastly, does Samantha ever ride a broom?  Yes!  In the Christmas show her flying broom has red bristles . . . .

Note:  On disc 4, the early teaser preview of ""The Da Vinci Code"" is an artistic visual treat.

DVD - 2006.  Picture: good.  Sound moderately low, clear.  Subtitles:  Spanish & Portuguese only.",1408320000,,1773,4.891891891891892

2638292,4,B000HIVIOM,"After viewing I agree with what several other reviewers claimed, that this was a so-so season.  Series is great, and acting is still great, but Darren was conspicuously absent on several episodes, leaving an obvious bare spot in the casting.  And the comedy has a slightly meaner edge to it, rather than the hilarious bits experienced in previous seasons.  Endora and Darren seem more easy to insult each other now, rather than just Endora picking on Darren.  All in all, still worth having in the collection, just seems to fall flatter somehow as the cast scurries to cover the absence of Darren and change to the ""new"" Gladys Kravitz.",1388534400,,636,4.807339449541284

2638294,5,B000HIVIOM,"My kids, of 16 yrs and 8 yrs, just love the show. We have buying the seasons in full and have been watching the shows at dinner time, sometimes all night. My kids love Harry Potter and this is just up their ""darn gone alley"". The kids realize that most of Harry Potter influence was gathered from Bewitched. Regardless, they love the 60's magic and wacky humor.

very good buy! indeed.",1387411200,,385,4.422535211267606
2638295,5,B000HIVIOM,"Season 4 of ""Bewitched"" may be my favorite yet. In this magical year, Samantha is coronated as Queen of the Witches--an idea that doesn't seem to get fully developed as its only brought up in a few episodes but did give us the hilarious episode ""Double, Double, Toil and Trouble"" in which Elizabeth Montgomery gets up to some mischief as Cousin Serena--who is masquerading as Samantha at the behest of Endora.

And of course, Endora and Darrin are having more of the battles that make this show so fun to watch as she zaps Derwood with any number of spells--some of my favorites being when she gives Darrin the ability to speak fluent italian in ""Business, Italian Style"" or the great battle that goes on between the two at the beginning of the episode ""If They Never Met.""

I almost keeled over when Endora zapped Darrin into that miniature car & Darrin later drives off shouting ""You're just lucky I'm late.""

And year 4 is the last time we get to enjoy the antics of lovable Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara--her last episode being ""Samantha's Secret Saucer."" I think it was wise and very respectful of the show's producers not to try and get another actress to be called ""Aunt Clara.""

And speaking of same character/different actors, Roy Roberts debuts as the new Frank Stephens, and of course, in 2 short years there will be a new Darrin Stephens as we all know as Dick York is missing yet again from 4 episodes due to Darrin being away on business or at the office all day.

But I would say that so far, York's absence was not as big a hindrance on the show as it would be in Season 5 when it feels like he misses half the year's episodes. I guess the grind of doing a daily sitcom was really getting to the poor guy.

But--those quibbles aside--year 4 is excellent and may rank as the best season yet of Bewitched.

2638342,4,B000HIVIOM,"It took me a while to get through season 4, and I find most of the reviews here a bit over-zealous.  To say this is the best season has got to be the biggest exaggeration.  It doesn't compare with seasons 1 or 2.  In fact, for a while I almost wanted to give this season 3 stars.  Here's why.  If you've seen season 3, you may have noticed that the quality of the storylines get weaker and weaker toward the end of that season (if you didn't think so then disregard this review).  Darrin's endless complaining about his wife's use of witchcraft starts getting worn - you'd think he'd have gotten used to it by now, but no. This is still beaten to death in one too many plotlines during this season.  It seemed like the writers were running short on good ideas, and this trend continues pretty much right through the first half of season 4, with a few exceptions, namely the introduction of Sam's 'twin', Serena, (episode 4 on disc 1 - ""Double, Double toil and trouble"", although Serena trumps this episode in a second appearance on disc 3).  ""My, what big ears you have"" on disc 2, as well as the two excellent episodes following it, ""I Get Your Nannie, You Get My Goat"" and ""Humbug Not To Be Spoken Here"" - pure Bewitched genious which thankfully start appearing once again here towards the end of the second disc.

Fortunately, the storylines continue to be pretty good in the second half of the set as the season redeems itself on the last 2 discs. Almost as if the writers are starting to find some sense of direction again. All's well that ends well? Perhaps. No doubt there are quite a few very funny episodes in this season - but there are almost as many (in the first half) that may make you wonder why you're still watching this show.  I'll probably get the next season hoping the upward trend of the end of season 4 continues into season 5.",1241654400,2,1850,4.383040935672515
2638343,5,B000HIVIOM,"""Bewitched"" continued to flourish, in this, the series' 4th season, that ran on ABC from 1967-1968. The program finished 11th for the year, with a whopping 22.5 Nielsen rating, and it was still one of the network's highest rated shows. 33 episodes are included in this set. Some of the best shows that season were ""If They Never Met"", which dealt with Samantha seeing what would have happened if Darren and Samantha never discovered one another. Nancy Kovak, who played Sheila, Darren's old girlfriend in the pilot, reprises her role here. Another good show is ""The Safe and Sane Halloween"", in which Glady's nephew is turned into a goat by ghouls made by Tabitha. Sadly, this was Marion Lorne's last year on ""Bewitched"" playing Aunt Clara, as the actress died. She would also receive an Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Comedy Series.

As much as I love the first and second seasons, I think Season Four is just about the Peak of the Wonder that is the Series we know as Bewitched. The Queen of Witches gave us a Long living Character that stood the test of time. Through many stories, many episodes, some stronger than others, and I think this varies based on your opinion, she and a great cast delivered with wonderful skill, and perfect charisma. The series has strong production values and hardly ever do you see the wires that allowed the tricks to be done in the flying tricks, but given such a fast production schedule, I guess some mistakes would happen.
My one and only complaint is that the space for any extras is taken up by stupid advertisements for other DVDs. This is a great DVD  for family viewing; great show, great entertainment.",1194566400,,934,4.461988304093567

Sabrina taking Sam's place for an afternoon and of course Darrin's growing ears.but my main reason for purchasing this season is because I think it highlights the work of Sandra Gould as Gladys Kravitz in color. her best episode is Splitsville where she stays at the Stevens. for any fan of Sandra Gould this is her definitive piece. and her reactions when Darrin's ears grow. and when Sam/Sabrina makes her shoes disappear. plus the episode where the spacemen zap her with a ""nice"" gun.

2638353,5,B000HIVIOM,"I feel ""Bewitched"" reached its creative apex in its fourth season. Seasons 1 and 4 may be my favorite years of the entire Series; but, I'm such a huge fan, how can I choose?  In Season 4, the writing was at an all-time, imaginative high.
  Watching such episodes as ""Long Live The Queen,"" ""Toys In Babeland,"" Business, Italian Style"", ""Double, Double Toil & Trouble,"" ""Out Of Sync, Out Of Mind,"" ""Allergic To Macedonian Dodo Birds,"" ""Once In A Vial"" and ""Hippie Hippie Hooray,"" it's easy to see that the outstanding cast of Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York, Agnes Moorehead, Marion Lorne, etc. were all going 100%, . Elizabeth Montgomery has great fun playing Cousin Serena, who creates havoc in the episodes ""Double, Double Toil & Trouble"" and ""Hippie, Hippie Hooray."" ""Double Double"" ends with a wild Three Stooges-like pie fight between Samantha, Darrin, Endora, and Serena.  In ""Hippie,"" Elizabeth sings the classic ""Iffin"" song, which fans cherish.
Sadly, Season 4 was the last year to showcase outstanding Marion Lorne as Samantha's beloved and bufuddled Aunt Clara. Marion Lorne passed away on May 9, 1968 at age 82. She won a posthumous Emmy as Best Supporting Actress in a TV Comedy for her role as Aunt Clara, which Elizabeth Montgomery accepted in her memory.
  Also sadly, Season 4 was the last year before Dick York's chronic back pain/injury and illnesses began to create serious production problems for the Series.  I loved this Season so much, I ran through Season 4 TWICE on DVD before starting Season 5.",1180137600,4,1520,4.9372549019607845
2638354,4,B000HIVIOM,"The fourth year of BEWITCHED saw the writers upping the stakes with some of the wackiest storylines ever featured in the series. Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York continued their perfect chemistry as the Stephens', with Agnes Moorehead stealing almost every scene as the catty mother-in-law from hell.

Sadly this was the final season to feature Marion Lorne as dotty Aunt Clara.  She passed away shortly before filming on the fifth season was to begin, but not before earning a much-deserved Emmy Award for her work.  Strangely though, the writers did not explain why we never see--or hear--of Aunt Clara again.  Elizabeth Montgomery was beginning to tire of playing goody-goody Samantha, so the writers made sure to include Sam's troublemaking lookalike cousin Serena at every possible opportunity in this and the subsequent seasons.  So now it's time to return to Morning Glory Circle as we continue our adventures with BEWITCHED...

Tabitha plays more into the show, and it is the last season that has Aunt Clara.  Samantha's cousin (her identical) adds a funny angle to the series, especially the episode where she plays a hip, hippy, strumming a guitar and freaking Larry out because he thinks she IS Samantha.

And didn't Larry have a reaction line about Samantha checking her ""groovy""?  Obviously, I have no way to check it out, but I'm 95% sure these are not the complete episodes.",1169251200,8,480,4.482758620689655

2638365,5,B000HIVIOM,I love my dvd's of bewitched.  I enjoyed watching it when I was young and now that I'm older I enjoy it more.  I can't wait for the next season to come out.,1168819200,3,156,3.696969696969697

2638367,4,B000HIVIOM,Not good as the earliest episodes but I really enjoyed it very much and will wait for any further releases of next episodes on DVD.,1168300800,2,131,4.28
2638368,5,B000HIVIOM,"This is a great season for Bewitched.  All the characters get episodes to shine.  Tabitha's growing up, Uncle Arthur, Serena and Endora are causing a lot of trouble for the Stephens', and Aunt Clara conjures up Leonardo Di Vinci, and space aliens.  And I believe this is the first season with the new Gladys Kravitz.

This season starts out with Samantha becoming ""Queen of the Witches"".  Endora gets a taste of her own medicine, Darrin learns Italian, Tabitha twitches up Prince Charming, Serena poses as Samantha to mess with Darrin, Uncle Arthur tricks Darrin into believing he's invincible against witchcraft with a fake charm.

This show was great then and great now.  I'm already looking forward to Season 5.",1168300800,4,714,4.949579831932773

8139890,4,B000HIVIOM,"This season is ok, but there are definitely more clunkers in this season already, compared to the first 3 seasons. It is not easy to consistently produce a good and creative television series.
In this season, we see a much more modern view of daily life in the 1960's. ""Aunt Clara"", ie Marion Lorne,  is featured in many episodes, with a similar story line each time. She passed away a few month later.
Not bad, a few very good episodes, but the peak of the series has passed, and now there is a lot of episode recycling.
I never cared for the ""Serena, hippie chick- cousin "" thing. They were trying to bring in audiences, but to me, it didn't work. It was unpleasant  filler.",1509753600,,676,4.4
