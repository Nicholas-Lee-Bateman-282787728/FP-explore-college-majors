8737482,5,6305108110,"I've seen Halloween so many times I can't even put a number on it. I've never seen a movie that caught my attention right from the beginning credits! That music....keeps lingering on your mind all movie long. Every  Halloween I put the movie on our big screen TV, right at the beginning and  turn off all the lights...even the trick-or-treaters get scared and they  said they never saw the movie! If you like horror films you've got to see  this classic. You won't be disappointed!",911692800,,481,4.623529411764705
