8345212,5,B001UW59KI,"An exceptionally clear and well done portrait of a very brilliant and ageless writer and explorer of our planet.  Matthiessen takes us on a journey into his thought provoking world, by showing us a simpler and much more profound way of 'seeing' into the very nature of ourselves as we try to make sense out of the mysteries and marvels of existence.  Matthiessen excites like a true storyteller....and amazes like a Zen Master!
This documentary weaves together clips from his experiences and his travels, coupled with interviews and stories from his many and varied friends, colleagues and family illuminating his long and illustrious life. Peopled with characters from his novels, and his forever love affair with the natural world, this is a must see!",1454889600,,753,5.064516129032258
8345213,5,B001UW59KI,"THis is a great video of the life of Peter Mattheiessen!  It begins with his early childhood and follows him through  his major life events.  It also talked about all the books he had written and his motivation behind each book.  Peter Matheiessen was and still is one of the first writers who discussed the ecology of the areas he wrote about.  He was one of the first authors to write about the plight of the planet and modern development, commercial exploitation,  and the native people who live in those areas.",1246147200,8,514,4.593406593406593
