with friends who enjoyed it also.",1399507200,2,223,4.6923076923076925
8568430,5,B00BH4198A,"And well acted.  The studios really missed out on not having Will Rogers Jr. play in more westerns.  He has a natural charm that really comes through in this picture.  As you watch him, notice how he's almost always doing something with his hands.  Much more to watch than just some actor just reciting his lines.  This movie is really a little gem.  I reccomend it highly.",1390694400,3,373,4.492537313432836

8568432,5,B00BH4198A,"This is a fine, homey Western with Will Rogers Jr. combining humor and a warm story line. The Warner Archive copy is very well produced, great color and sharp picture. All in all, a fine ""family-style"" Western.",1368144000,,210,4.702702702702703
