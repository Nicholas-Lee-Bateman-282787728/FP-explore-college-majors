3146913,5,B0015QT77U,"Tim Ried, I want to tell you that ""Frank's Place"" was the best show ever to be on TV.  The only time I ever wrote a letter to a network was when it was cancelled.  In fact, almost twenty years later, I still haven't forgiven CBS for letting this gem of a show fade into oblivion.  Every episode was a treasure and gave all of us all a precious slice of New Orleans every week.  The hardest I ever laughed in my whole life was the episode where those guys ""borrowed"" the corpse from the funeral home for a last drink and then the chaos ensued!  Oh, to see that one again as well as all of the other impeccably crafted episodes.  Twenty years to wait for ""Frank's Place"" to come out DVD is long enough!!!",1216425600,22,702,4.125
3146914,5,B0015QT77U,"My wife and I loved this show during its initial run and have talked about it ever since.  My memory was that it was prematurely canceled due to a writer's strike.  The tragedy of this show being canceled before its time was that its incredible ensemble cast seemed to be just warming up to very deep characters.  The atmosphere presented by Frank's Place was like visiting another country.  The aura of New Orleans was as central a part of this series as anything else including the stars.  After all the attention paid to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, the copyright holders are nuts not to get this series issued out on DVD as soon as possible.",1216080000,12,653,4.594827586206897
3146915,5,B0015QT77U,"Why hasn't Frank's Place, one of the all time greatest shows about the South not come out on DVD  ?  Definitely sign me up for one of the first copies if he powers that be should decide to put it out.",1214956800,39,200,3.8536585365853657
3146916,5,B0015QT77U,"My memory gets more unreliable with the passing of years. I remember this as one of the best things I have ever seen, either on TV or at the movies. But it has been so many years. I don't know if my return to the promised land of Frank's Place will be all I now remember it to be. But you can be sure I will buy the DVD when it comes out.",1214870400,8,338,3.643835616438356
3146917,5,B0015QT77U,"I've been waiting years for this show to come out on dvd. The memory of it haunts me like no other show . I think that it was on BET cable for awhile, but not anymore. And what ever happened to Hugh Wilson, it's creator? He also did WKRP, and once did a cameo on Frank's Place as a health inspector. Sigh. This would be a perfect time for a DVD version - black presidental candidate, New Orleans, a return to your roots. If people could see it now, it would be an instant hit!",1213747200,19,476,4.021052631578947
3146918,5,B0015QT77U,"To the powers that be, please release this great series on DVD! It was continually funny, moving and very realistic. Probably the best cancelled show ever. I'm signed up to get it if they ever release it.
Favorite episode: Where Frank decides to bring live entertainment to the restuarant. ""Really? You can get me Bo Diddley?"" Trust me it's priceless.",1213056000,14,351,4.866666666666666
3146919,5,B0015QT77U,"I've waited nearly 20 years for this wonderful show to become available. Why it was not renewed after just one year remains a mystery to me.  The warm humor, interesting characters and quirky plots kept us eagerly coming back week after week.  It was truly a gem.",1212883200,42,263,4.574468085106383
3146920,5,B0015QT77U,"Strange,I suppose,my being white and this cast mainly black,the more I watched this short series, how the cast reminded me of my relatives and close friends,warm and wonderful,smart and humorous. I couldn't believe it when the series was dropped,it had so much potential to bring viewers together as a group. It showed New Orleans in a way that made me want to be there, and to find a restaurant just like Frank's Place, the easy pace of life I'd have liked to be a part of. The humor was refined and sharp, I've always been a fan of Tim Reid,ever since his part as Venus Flytrap on WKRP in Cincinnati, another great show let slip away by the networks. This show is fun and enjoyment for all, even in it's too shortened run,you'll enjoy each and every character and wish for more.",1210982400,66,780,4.5
3146921,5,B0015QT77U,"I, too, have been waiting years for Frank's Place to come out on DVD.  One of the best written shows ever!!!  It was probably too smart for its time. It's heartening to see that there are others out there who remember it as fondly as I do; I was beginning to think I was the only person who remembered it. This would be a show worth owning and viewing repeatedly.  I'd love to share it with friends.",1353283200,,399,4.1558441558441555

It always gets a super response!!  My absolute favorite is the voodoo doctor episode and the one where Frank's friends steal the body of their friend from the mortuary.  Hilarious stuff.  Beautifully written and acted.",1352419200,,370,4.545454545454546
3146923,5,B0015QT77U,"did anybody ever after make the idiot mistake of not securing the performance rights for all purposes for the shows they were in of any and all music in them I will never know).  Anyway, I am covered.  I wish everyone else was because Frank's Place was as perfect as a show could be - I never saw anything in it that missed it's mark in any way.  Thought they were stupid for not continuing it (and, sorry, but the next show the Reids did just did not have what Frank's Place had) it was a sparkling jewel in the crown of Television's best shows ever. I suspect it will remain so.......

Note for statisticals: I am white as is my wife and we both loved it - but the show was neither.  The show was just people.",1350432000,,711,4.1231884057971016
3146924,5,B0015QT77U,"Frank's Place was one of the most extraordinary half hours on television, justification for the quirky ""dramedy"" genre all by itself.  Read other comments here for details, I'm writing to share what I've learned about why this cultural gem (all the more important in the shattered aftermath of Katrina) is still not out on non-bootlegged DVD, where it certainly belongs.

The problem, ironically, is what most remember as one of the show's great virtues - its amazing New Orleans soundtrack.  The producers only secured broadcast rights for those songs, not the right to include them in commercial video recordings.  Had they done so up front, Frank's Place would have been released years ago.  Unfortunately, nowadays the rights to that treasure trove of material have gotten so expensive that it breaks any reasonable budget for the project before it can even start.  Believe it or not, the only practical alternative seems to be commissioning and recording entirely new performances, and Reid respects the music too much to do it half-baked, so it's going to be a lot of work, and I've no idea if they've started.  Here's hoping this wonderful American creation is finally allowed to reach its audience.",1332115200,27,1206,5.0606060606060606
3146925,5,B0015QT77U,"We loved this show. The brown bag episode was classic. We had given up on trying to get the DVD after my wife and daughter was scammed out of $50 on eBay years back hoping to surprise me for Christmas. We were new to the internet and daughter and she were thrilled to see it on eBay, threw caution to wind and sent a check. Wrong. On a crazy whim, I tried Amazon today and there you all were in the same boat we were in many years ago. The mystery as to why it hasn't been released would make a good series in itself, don't you think? We would love to see the series again this year of our 60th wedding anniversary. Now, I can hope again, but hurry up. Frank",1329955200,,658,3.992424242424242
3146926,5,B0015QT77U,"This series was so wonderful and thought provoking.  It made you look at your own life with humor, careful retrospection and a whole lot of understanding about human nature.  I was devastated when they took off the air.  That's what happens when you're too good.",1327190400,3,262,4.777777777777778
3146927,5,B0015QT77U,"""Frank's Place"" was the best TV show/movie about New Orleans ever done, in addition to being one of the best written, acted and produced shows ever done. I hated what they did with it... screwing up the dates and times when they must have known how many fans it had who wanted to see it weekly. I'm sure I am not the only one who loved it, so please, please get it on DVD so I can show it to people who didn't get a chance to see it originally, and so I can have the pleasure of seeing this great show again... one of the all time best TV shows ever made.",1325548800,2,555,3.920353982300885
3146928,5,B0015QT77U,My theory of why Frank's Place remains unavailable is that it would be like tossing a beautiful diamond ring in a mud puddle--why release a show that would create comparisons with programming that cannot compete on any level with Frank's Place?,1323561600,3,244,4.975609756097561
3146929,5,B0015QT77U,"The Entertainment Industry never comprehends when they have a gem. Frank's Place was one of the best shows on television at the time and possibly ever. The sweet restaurant, Chez Helene that it was based on vanished after Katrina and Chef Austin Leslie did not survive the evacuation. His was the 1st Second Line to be held in New Orleans after the storm. For his memory alone they should release the DVD.",1320796800,,405,4.638888888888889
3146930,5,B0015QT77U,"One of my favorite TV series of all times.  The episodes were exciting, the characters had depth, and the plots were entertaining.  This would be great New Orleans nostalgia.",1316822400,,174,4.9655172413793105

3146932,5,B0015QT77U,"Frank's Place was warm, funny, intelligent.  Much better than the pseudo-Amos and Andy garbage like the lamentable ""Martin"".  The ""Dead Body"" episode is a classic of TV Comedy.  WHY HAS THIS NOT COME OUT ON DVD YET?!?  Come-on!  They even have those nauseating ""reality"" shows out on DVD.  Whoever has the rights to it (Tim Reid says it is the studio) Stop messing around and release it!!!  Your fan base is not getting any younger and if you release it too late, no one will still be around who remembers it.  Can't make money THAT way.",1312156800,,537,4.520833333333333
3146933,5,B0015QT77U,What a great TV show! I understand that it was canceled because the network felt that it was not the right time for a show as such. I would love for a major network to re-introduce the early shows. BET broadcasted them several years ago.,1311120000,,237,4.288888888888889

3146935,5,B0015QT77U,"Though my wife and I are white, we never missed an episode of this show, and were shccked when it was cancelled.  The episode that the old men were moving the body of their dead friend around town was absolutely hysterical.  Please make this available so we can enjoy it all over again.",1307145600,,286,4.377358490566038

3146937,5,B0015QT77U,"I really loved this show. It was so good in every aspect that I was sure it would go on for many seasons. Then CBS started switching it all over the schedule and preempting it for stuff I wouldn't have watched if they'd paid me. I'm pretty sure I never saw all of the episodes because the TV Guide would list it where it had been the week before, only ooops! CBS had wedged it somewhere else in the schedule and I missed it. Then came the news that they'd cancelled it, and I sent CBS a letter (how long ago....) saying that it would have had terrific viewership if they'd had some respect for the show and left its scheduling alone. But no...
I was just reading some sitcom site where various people said they just hadn't been able to get into the show because there was no laugh track, so they didn't know where to laugh. (!!?!) I'd say that anyone who didn't fall off their chair laughing when Frank first shakes hands with the beautiful mortician in the pilot episode deserves to be condemned to watch a marathon of, oh I don't know, Joey, perhaps. It's 24 years later and just the thought of that scene and others makes me laugh.
I still hope it'll someday be available on DVD, as there are several people I know who really NEED a set, IMO. Firefly didn't last as many episodes as Frank's Place, and it's on DVD, so perhaps there's a chance.",1298160000,5,1346,4.303149606299213

3146939,5,B0015QT77U,"I have been waiting and wishing for a DVD of this show for years. This is a great example of TV networks not allowing enough time for word of mouth to spread through the African American community to allow this Great show to succeed. The phenomena was again demonstrated last week by NBC which cancelled the show Undercovers. What a shame on both counts. Tim, what are you waiting for?...this would have made a great Christmas present.",1290384000,2,435,4.662337662337662
3146940,5,B0015QT77U,"I still remember how upset everyone was when this wonderful show was cancelled. I too wrote a letter to the network; how young and naive we were. Anyway, it's still unbelievable that Frank's Place was cancelled when there was (and continues to be) so much dreck on television. I will gladly buy this series when it becomes available.",1285891200,2,333,4.758620689655173
3146941,5,B0015QT77U,"This show was a work of art, from the opening (Armstrong singing Do You Know What It Means) to the brilliant writing.  Whoever can greenlight putting this on DVD is heartless for making the fans wait so long for it and for depriving newcomers of ""a great work of art"".  Television rarely deals with African American culture outside of stereotypes and cliches.  This show gives you an idea of how diverse and entertaining American television could and should be.

The writing and acting was funny and intelligent.  Cultural references like ""the brown bag test"" and ""the Drivers"" gave small glimpses into the rich history that is the story of African Americans.  Setting Frank Jr.'s intellectual grounding against the superstitions and folklore of New Orleans was brilliant and entertaining.  It could have easily been hokey and predictable, but it never was.  Those who later enjoyed Northern Exposure would have loved this show.

You can't help but wonder what of the stories and experiences of Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and the other non-white Americans, who Hollywood ignores?  How many wonderful stories and experiences are we missing?  American television is run by Hollywood and Hollywood is run by small-minded racists.

Hopefully, internet television will bring a new seat of power to mass media and we will at long last see ALL of the American experience on television, not just White America.

Show the world ""Frank's Place"" on DVD and thereby, really support the arts.  It was honestly that good and that unique.",1282348800,7,1532,5.100401606425703
3146942,5,B0015QT77U,"Frank's Place was a realistic depiction of New Orleans during that time.  I lived in New Orleans for 12 years and was living there when ""Frank's Place"" was aired. I can't tell you how I used to look forward to seeing the show since I had a physical point of reference.  I had eaten in the restaurant that was featured in Frank's Place many times and had met the original Owner/Chef, Austin Leslie, and have his first mini-cookbook which included his photograph with his trademark Captain's hat and it was autographed by him.  I was sick, disgusted and frustrated when the show was cancelled.  I am looking forward to getting a DVD copy of Frank's Place which showed a true ""slice"" of New Orleans and a peek into some of the original culture that made it such a unique city in all of the USA!!

The Reids would love to release it on DVD but VIACOM owns the rights and for some unfathomable reason has chosen not to release it.

It was one of the best-written and funniest shows I've ever seen.  The episode where the one guy dies and his friends ""borrow"" his body from the funeral home so they can have a last party with him was absolutely hilarious.  All were great, though.

I recently decided to burn my old VHS tapes to DVD. In my collection of tapes, I found a copy of a copy of several episodes of Frank's Place that I had captured from the original broadcasts. Sadly, I found my only remaining tape of Frank's Place episodes was broken. With hesitation, I sadly tossed my old VHS cassette in the trash.

The next morning, I called a local videotape-repair shop who told me the cost to repair the tape was $18. I thought ""is there any chance my recollections of the series are as good as I thought?"" I literally pulled the broken tape out of the trash and took it in for repair.

When I got the repaired tape back, I popped it in my VCR. After watching two episodes of Frank's Place, I humbly say I would have paid the repair cost X 100 for the satisfaction of seeing this astonishing bit of excellence once again.

My husband and I used to LOVE it.  We looked forward to it every week.  It made us gut-laugh one minute then get emotionally choked up the next.  The characters were all so wonderful, so richly developed.  And the interactions, the situations, were brilliant.  Very human, very real, and very entertaining.  Touching, sweet and funny.

Didn't understand the music release problems until recently, and I too would happily pay a premium for the INcomparable originals, as brilliantly selected and absolutely integral to the story lines as the writing, casting, acting, character and community development, historical perspective, 'teaching moments,' production, etc.  Never saw this as a 'BLACK comedy,' but as the most universal series ever before or since. . .

Literate, funny, wonderful acting, great ambiance, terrific music that totally suited the scenes.  But from what I've read, the DVD  release won't be the exact same thing, because they say it's too expensive to get the rights to the original music.  I've read that the music or much of it will be replaced with something ""comparable"".  It's impossible to know in advance how good that will be, though I expect they will try to do a good job.  I recently found that I have 2 episodes on home videotape, poor quality.  One, a drama, seems a little dated.  The other, the famous ""last night out"" for the dead drinking buddy, and reminiscent of the Cuban movie ""Death of a Bureaucrat"" was as hilarious as ever.

And that goes double for 'Frank's Place'.  I am signed up when (not if) this show becomes availble on DVD.  Tim Reid (star, co-creator) and Hugh Wilson (co-creator not just of 'Frank's Place' but also of 'WKRP' and the 'Police Academy' films) shared with us not just a vision of NOLA but also of a place that sticks with you like one of those delicious-looking dishes that hails from there.  My people came from White Castle, Louisiana and they moved during the great migration to Chicago. My grandmother and my aunts made meals in those kitchens that provided me with a glimpse of another time & place.  Now with our fast food culture, there are more than a few of us who yearn for those memories instilled in those offerings.  'Frank's Place' is one of those menu offerings I want to return to.  Reid is to be commended for wanting to carefully replace the prohibitively costly soundtrack with music that will hopefully protect the atmosphere he and Wilson lovingly constructed.  Whenever supper's ready, Tim, just call us in.  We'll come a-runnin'.",1255132800,2,1339,4.708154506437769

3146960,5,B0015QT77U,"Frank's Place was indeed a gem of a show. The writing was excellent, as were the acting and production. The characters had real depth. Frank, a Boston professor who inherits a Louisiana restaurant from his estranged father, finds himself running the restaurant, instead of selling it (his original intent). The series chronicled Frank's journey of discovery of both his heritage and his new environment. The well-told stories hold universal appeal. Hope This is issued in DVD in the near future!",1254528000,,495,5.2
3146961,5,B0015QT77U,"Frank's Place was an amazing show about good people in a great place doing their best to get by. It perfectly captured much about New Orleans, and showed how folks from outside Louisiana have trouble understanding a lot that is taken for granted in New Orleans. I thought it was perfect that when Shorty spoke, the show showed subtitles because outsiders couldn't understand his accent. I grew up there but moved away for career reasons. My sons love New Orleans, but still don't fully comprehend a lot about it even after 4 years at nearby LSU, and after MANY family visits to NOLA. I would love for them to see Frank's Place, and I want a set of DVDs for myself.",1251504000,,664,4.4958677685950414
3146962,5,B0015QT77U,"TV and movies often give people the wrong idea about New Orleans.  You usually hear Cajun music and a bunch of people calling each other ""cher"". Anyone who really knows NOLA, knows this is not the way it is.  Frank's Place was the exception, and unfortunately, the only exception I've ever seen. It depicts a New Orleans, which doesn't really exist any more (especially post-Katrina), but was very real at the time.

I am now a New Orleans resident.  There are many transplants here now, and it brings to mind a saying around here ""I wasn't born in New Orleans - New Orleans was born in me.""  I think that Frank's Place helped nurture that ""inner New Orleans child"" in me.

I read an interview with Tim Reid about this show, and the reasons it hasn't been re-released.  The answer, as someone mentioned in a previous review, is the music.  He said just the cost of using Louis Armstrong's version of ""Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans"" was prohibitive.  Add to that the royalties for all the other wonderful music in that show, and you can see the problem. Reid felt that to change any of the music would destroy the ambience so carefully created. As a musician myself, I can understand that people need to be paid for their work. I do wish there could be some compromise so the world can once again have this treasure.",1250294400,,1331,4.466942148760331

I videotaped most of the original series but UNWISELY loaned it to a family member and haven't seen it since.  I would LOVE to have this series in my DVD collection.  The time couldn't be better -- Barrack Obama notwithstanding.  After the non-response of the federal government to the people of New Orleans -- its total lack of compassion, sensitivity, and downright criminalization of those persons whose lives also were destroyed. I think the release of this show could help restore the dignity and humanity of the residents of New Orleans.  Especially their WONDERFUL commitment to family, community, and history, the residents express in many of the documentaries and TV shows that have aired post-Kartina.

Perhaps, a portion of the proceeds from this DVD could go to assist those WONDERFUL families who are STILL struggling to rebuild and restore thier homes, families and lives.  Just a thought !!!",1250035200,,999,5.079754601226994
3146964,5,B0015QT77U,"""Frank's Place"" was probably the finest black comedy television has ever produced. The story lines, the acting, the actors were all first rate.  Why it was ever yanked from the air I will never know and apparently it is some dark, cold secret. My favorite episode is ""Ed is Lost"" all about faternity member Ed who died and ""the boys"" take Ed to places he wanted to see but had not. And he was DEAD. The ending is to ""die for"" and funny as anything can be.  I taped alot of the episodes on VHS then years later put them onto a DVD here at home.  I lost some of the VHS tapes, so I only have about nine episodes.  ""Ed"" is my favorite. Thank you Tim Reid and the cast.  and a BIG BOOOOOO to BET to not letting them be reproduced.  I have ""Amos and Andy"" on DVD, the whole set; was ""Frank's Place"" any worse or better than that?  I don't think so.  The black comedies out today on TV are FAR WORSE than ""Frank's Place"" seems to have been. Who can we write to, to get this onto DVD's for sale.",1247961600,,988,4.030769230769231

Reid has had trouble getting permission to use most of the original music or that it was too expensive and has been trying to get rights to other ""atmosphere appropriate"" music to keep the flavor and feel of the show.

Back in the day, it was ""slowest speed"" recording to get the max number of episodes on the tape. I loved the show - a rare mix of comedy and humanity made all the better by a terrific cast.

Well, the tapes sat in a box since then. Late last  year I came across them. I expected them to be dated, perhaps a bit corny, but no. It was every bit as good, as humane, and as funny as the first time around - no - better, perhaps because I was 20 years older and wiser.

When I saw (on TVonDVD.com I believe) that Tim Reid was going to develop the show for release on DVD I was VERY happy. As soon as I received the ""Order now"" for Amazon, count me in for at least one set (maybe two or three for gifts). I can't wait!",1239148800,,762,3.8653846153846154

Simply, what other show from the 80's makes such an impact on someones twenty years later?  Frank's Place was phenomenal and I hope that whoever it was at CBS that killed this show has trouble living it down.",1237939200,2,551,4.581632653061225

When you consider where television networks have invested their energy, money, and time, it's no surprise a work as promising, uplifting, and well crafted as Frank's Place would be put aside and replaced with something worthless.

I'm so hopeful that this series will be out on DVD soon. It should be seen again and again.

I even bought a copy of the teleplay of the pilot, which states that the character of Cool (we find out in the nonexistent second season) is the half-brother of Frank.

Favorite Lines: ""Frank, I've got makeup on"" and ""Those ain't no ladies, Frank"". Favorite minor character: The Bum.

While there have been some great comedies since then--the early Cheers (with Diane) and Frazier top my list--but nothing like those ""dramedies"" (as some called them), with no laugh track. Same year as ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,"" another of this quirky genre. Sad that all three only lasted one season, and there's never been an experiment like these since.

The problem, ironically, is what most remember as one of the show's great virtues - its amazing New Orleans soundtrack.  The producers only secured broadcast rights for those songs, not the right to include them in commercial video recordings.  Had they done so up front, Frank's Place would have been released years ago.  Unfortunately, nowadays the rights to that treasure trove of material have gotten so expensive that it breaks any reasonable budget for the project before it can even start.  Believe it or not, the only practical alternative seems to be commissioning and recording entirely new performances, and Reid respects the music too much to do it half-baked, so it's going to be a lot of work, and I've no idea if they've started.

I'm pretty sure I never saw all of the episodes because the TV Guide would list it where it had been the week before, only ooops! CBS had wedged it somewhere else in the schedule and I missed it. Then came the news that they'd cancelled it, and I sent CBS a letter (how long ago....) saying that it would have had terrific viewership if they'd had some respect for the show and left its scheduling alone. But no...
I was just reading some sitcom site where various people said they just hadn't been able to get into the show because there was no laugh track, so they didn't know where to laugh. (!!?!) I'd say that anyone who didn't fall off their chair laughing when Frank first shakes hands with the beautiful mortician in the pilot episode deserves to be condemned to watch a marathon of, oh I don't know, Joey, perhaps. It's 24 years later and just the thought of that scene and others makes me laugh.

Whoever can greenlight putting this on DVD is heartless for making the fans wait so long for it and for depriving newcomers of ""a great work of art"".  Television rarely deals with African American culture outside of stereotypes and cliches.  This show gives you an idea of how diverse and entertaining American television could and should be.

The writing and acting was funny and intelligent.  Cultural references like ""the brown bag test"" and ""the Drivers"" gave small glimpses into the rich history that is the story of African Americans.  Setting Frank Jr.'s intellectual grounding against the superstitions and folklore of New Orleans was brilliant and entertaining.  It could have easily been hokey and predictable, but it never was.  Those who later enjoyed Northern Exposure would have loved this show.

You can't help but wonder what of the stories and experiences of Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and the other non-white Americans, who Hollywood ignores?  How many wonderful stories and experiences are we missing?  American television is run by Hollywood and Hollywood is run by small-minded racists.

Hopefully, internet television will bring a new seat of power to mass media and we will at long last see ALL of the American experience on television, not just White America.

Sadly, I found my only remaining tape of Frank's Place episodes was broken. With hesitation, I sadly tossed my old VHS cassette in the trash.

The next morning, I called a local videotape-repair shop who told me the cost to repair the tape was $18. I thought ""is there any chance my recollections of the series are as good as I thought?"" I literally pulled the broken tape out of the trash and took it in for repair.

When I got the repaired tape back, I popped it in my VCR. After watching two episodes of Frank's Place, I humbly say I would have paid the repair cost X 100 for the satisfaction of seeing this astonishing bit of excellence once again.

My grandmother and my aunts made meals in those kitchens that provided me with a glimpse of another time & place.

Anyone who really knows NOLA, knows this is not the way it is.  Frank's Place was the exception, and unfortunately, the only exception I've ever seen. It depicts a New Orleans, which doesn't really exist any more (especially post-Katrina), but was very real at the time.

I am now a New Orleans resident.  There are many transplants here now, and it brings to mind a saying around here ""I wasn't born in New Orleans - New Orleans was born in me.""  I think that Frank's Place helped nurture that ""inner New Orleans child"" in me.

I read an interview with Tim Reid about this show, and the reasons it hasn't been re-released.  The answer, as someone mentioned in a previous review, is the music.  He said just the cost of using Louis Armstrong's version of ""Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans"" was prohibitive.  Add to that the royalties for all the other wonderful music in that show, and you can see the problem. Reid felt that to change any of the music would destroy the ambience so carefully created. As a musician myself, I can understand that people need to be paid for their work.

When you consider where television networks have invested their energy, money, and time, it's no surprise a work as promising, uplifting, and well crafted as Frank's Place would be put aside and replaced with something worthless.

I'm so hopeful that this series will be out on DVD soon. It should be seen again and again.

3381468,5,B0015QT77U,"With top-of-the-line writing and production values, this series rates first on my all-time tv show list, in front of The Andy Griffith Show and The Rockford Files. I was mesmerized from the first episode.

I even bought a copy of the teleplay of the pilot, which states that the character of Cool (we find out in the nonexistent second season) is the half-brother of Frank.

Favorite Lines: ""Frank, I've got makeup on"" and ""Those ain't no ladies, Frank"". Favorite minor character: The Bum.

Poignant, funny, sad, enlightening---22 episodes of sheer joy while observing the human condition-----time, place, race notwithstanding.

3381469,5,B0015QT77U,"This was one of the classiest comedies ever...along with ""Slap Maxwell,"" a series that same year.  What a year that was (1986-87)! While there have been some great comedies since then--the early Cheers (with Diane) and Frazier top my list--but nothing like those ""dramedies"" (as some called them), with no laugh track. Same year as ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,"" another of this quirky genre. Sad that all three only lasted one season, and there's never been an experiment like these since.

I lived in New Orleans for three years, and they captured the spirit of the city dead-on.  A shame that it died, and a TERRIBLE shame that it's not available on DVD!",1233100800,2,663,4.698275862068965

Perhaps someone in the DVD department forgot about the series? Perhaps someone in the DVD scheduling department lost the memo telling them to release it on DVD? Who knows?

I am almost 50 years old, and I have never enjoyed any TV show as much as I enjoyed ""Frank's Place"".  The quirky characters and storylines were just incredible. The inner city of New Orleans is far too often portrayed as a world of hopelessness, drugs and crime.  But ""Frank's Place"" captured the experience of what seemed to be very real people, both saints and sinners, just trying to get by and find a little pleasure in life along the way.  It was never ""PC"" or preachy, but always left you with a feeling that people make the most of life no matter what is dealt to them.",1221004800,3,780,4.358620689655172

8259503,5,B0015QT77U,"""Frank's Place"" aired for just one season in 1987.  I remember this series so clearly, even after so many years. It was, simply, one of the best I've ever seen. Fresh and funny, the cast was exceptional, and dialogue real.  The premise was not unusual--the perennial fish-out-of-water. This time it was Reid, a Boston professor who inherits The Chez (say the z), a small restaurant in New Orleans. I can't believe I still remember the name of the place...particularly after having just watched the entire ten billion episodes of breaking bad and could not tell you one character's name. Circumstances (and a voodoo curse) are such that he's pretty much obligated to stay and learn how to live in the South, run a restaurant, and figure out a culture that is possibly more alien to a New York or Boston black man than that of a foreign country.

The cast was not the usual sitcom pretty faces and included a lot of talented and underutilized actors...notably Robert Harper (who had the wonderful name of Bubba Weinberger) and Daphne Reid as the love interest.  The producers used locals, including Don Yesso, who had never acted before, in several key roles.  Yesso played a character named Shorty, the lone white restaurant employee. His accent sounded more Brooklyn than Nawleans, but it was accurate.  That magnolia drawl most actors assay to play French Quarter types is strictly Actor's Studio.  Yesso went on to play Stanley Kowalski opposite Jessica Lange as Blanche DuBois in a 1992 Broadway revival of ""Streetcar Named Desire.""  Only three other actors have ever tackled the role on Broadway: Marlon Brando, Alec Baldwin and Jack Palance.  I think I'd prefer Yesso to those last two by a long shot.

The humor at ""Frank's Place"" was broad on occasion, satirical on others, but never expected. And there was an interesting undercurrent of racial tension...it was presented in new ways and not always inter-racial. I remember one episode about a club for blacks that would only admit members who could pass the paper bag test.  I didn't know about this before the show, but some black people are very biased against dark skin tones. Anything 'lighter than a paper bag' is the acceptable shade. This was the unspoken requirement for the organization Frank wished to join. Lots of interesting little tidbits like that made the show unlike most other sitcoms, then or now.

After just that one season, the show disappeared with no fanfare, no outcry.  Tim Reid has worked since them, fairly regularly, but nothing he has done has come close to this. He played a disc jockey on a dreadful show that, unaccountably became a huge success: WKRP in Cincinnati. The show is most notable for introducing (inflicting?) Loni Anderson on the population.

Most recently, Reid plays another New Orleans character, a judge in the excellent ""Treme,"" a show that feels like a direct descendent of this original piece of work. This new cable show is set in post-Katerina NO. Its music, issues, and humor are all a little reminiscent of what we saw on ""Frank's Place.""  The difference is, ""Treme"" has a tremendous budget and this series was done on a shoestring. Amazing what sheer talent can do.  But no one wanted to watch, being glued the screen by ""Who's The Boss,"" I guess. Was it P.T. Barnum who said nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public?  From the reviews here, there was a handful of people who could tell the difference between comedy and a laugh track and they still miss the show a quarter of a century later.  I am eager to see this little slice of TV history again...maybe it will be available on DVD.  I hope so.",1393113600,2,3647,4.797124600638978
