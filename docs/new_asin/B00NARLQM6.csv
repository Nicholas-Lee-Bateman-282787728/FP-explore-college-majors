6622450,3,B00NARLQM6,As much as i love Ryan Nicholsons films i was a little let down by this movie. The main character is cool as hell but the film itself  just wasn't gory enough for me. Worth owning if your a fan but not his best.,1424736000,2,211,3.7954545454545454
6622451,4,B00NARLQM6,Being a fan of Ryan Nicholson I picked this up over the past holiday. I very much enjoyed it. If you're familiar with his films you know what to expect. Its a bloody good time.,1422403200,,176,4.057142857142857
6622452,5,B00NARLQM6,"Brutal, dark, perverse, disgusting, horrific, humorless, sick, twisted.....perfect!
Another brutal gem from Nick Principle.",1421712000,3,123,7.857142857142857
6622453,5,B00NARLQM6,"This film is directed by Ryan NIcholson, who created such films as, ""Hanger"" and ""Gutterballs"". If you liked those flicks, then you're in for a treat. However, if you think you know what you're about to see...you're mistaken. ""Collar"" is unlike any of the other features I've seen from Plotdigger Films. While some of the others have some comedy thrown in here and there, this one has no humor at all. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying it's the most ""mean"" of Nicholson's films. It's pretty brutal (in terms of gore and there's some rape involved as well). There's a small bit of a backstory that tries to explain why the title character is the way he is. But it's nothing too over the top, and I honestly would've been fine without it. The kills are pretty damn gory and they all look outstanding (as is the case with all Ry's films). I honestly can't say anything negative about the flick. I'm not a professional reviewer, I just see something, I dig it (or not) and write a small read up on it. I know what it's like wanting to see some of this underground stuff and wanting to know a little more about it.

Like I said, the kills are great, the story is cool (back story, to me, wasn't needed though), Nick Principe does a fantastic job as the lead, it's the meanest and most brutal of all of Plotdigger's films which makes me incredibly happy, and the soundtrack is killer! Definitely do yourself a favor and pick this up. If you're sick of the same thing over and over and looking for a mean, brutal fresh killer...COLLAR is your man ;)",1419465600,17,1552,4.407665505226481
6622454,2,B00NARLQM6,in my opinion the film is a waste of time and money.,1418256000,8,52,3.4166666666666665

8676974,5,B00NARLQM6,"Pretty entertaining for an oddball horror movie about a killer, Satanic bum. Worth my money.",1511222400,,92,5.2
8676975,1,B00NARLQM6,"I usually never say anything negative, but this movie came with so much hype that I thought I'd share the truth. ITS AWFUL! it looks like a movie my brother and I made in high school. The acting is childish and forced. The blood is too watery and splashed around just for the sake of it. Not a single redeeming quality. This new breed of wanna-be directors that get A+ packaging for their F- efforts. Garbage total garbage. I think you should watch HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN instead.",1492905600,,477,4.431818181818182

8676980,5,B00NARLQM6,"i will NOT give away spoilers for this, but i will say it is a VERY fast paced horror film with a very dark/dank street and neighborhood feel to.

must be seen to be understood, given people go in without expectations, because the plot ""writes itself"". i don't just watch horror films i study them simultaniously!

the soundtrack is great also! very much creepy, mindscapng and more!",1450828800,5,383,4.701492537313433
8676981,5,B00NARLQM6,This is one of the darkest and most unnerving films I've ever seen. See why at www.deaducated.com,1443312000,,97,4.764705882352941
8676982,3,B00NARLQM6,"""Collar"" as a film is hot and cold.

Highpoints and merits:  its excessively dark in tone- the villian is strange and original - the original soundtrack is effective and exudes quality.  The female actresses are cute, clearly girls next door.
Weak points: The plot is paper thin.  The acting and dialogue delivery is stunted (super heavy Canadian accent spoken by most of the cast is hard to decipher at times).  The gore is present, but the edits pull away from the image too quickly and left me craving more.  Something felt missing with the overall package, perhaps the ending was a bit rushed and inconclusive.
All in all, an average beit ambitious effort from the folks known as PlotDigger Films.  Hope they continue to shock us horror fans, Eh!",1434499200,3,750,4.767441860465116
