8482536,5,B005POWEBE,"this 8 disc set seemed like it would just be a repackaging of the previous 8-disk set 'the great gig in the sky', and indeed, a few of the discs here are the same...

however...many of the discs have been changed from that former packaging to repackaging of their 'rock milestone' series of pink floyd titles...

now they are all great and deserve to be owned by any pink floyd fan, but...packaged this way, you lose any mention of 'division bell' or 'animals' (one of my favorite floyd albums)...

may not seem like a big difference, but the 'rock milestone' discs do indeed have different bits on them from 'the great gig in the sky' collection, so both are required viewing...

now to just get my hands on the original box set...",1470355200,2,732,4.5227272727272725
