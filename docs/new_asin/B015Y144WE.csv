7453983,5,B015Y144WE,"Eli Roth brilliantly directs Keanu Reeves, Ana De Armas and Lorenza Izzo in this fun, campy and  crazy dark comedy thriller.  It's a tightly shot and well edited.  Superb pacing & brilliant acting w/an epic FBomb  [how many?]  rant from Evan, incredibly well  acted by Keanu Reeves.  Loved it .",1444348800,3,294,4.76
7453984,1,B015Y144WE,"This was my first Eli Roth. It will be my last. Any (demented) 12 year old could write a better script. Please someone write lovely Keanu a good film script. I really went into this with an open and generous mind, but it's really trash.",1444348800,2,236,4.266666666666667
7453985,2,B015Y144WE,"My goodness, campy, silly, inane and even boring.  No standards for this film and one that has Eli foisting some cartoon character plotline where two random girls who rail against the 'cheating husband' simultaneously throw themselves at him.  I could have dealt with the plethora of shortcomings here as long as it was supplemented with what Roth used to offer up. Instead I witnessed a train wreck of a film that left more questions than satisfaction and confusion instead of any semblance of understanding.  I am indeed convinced that the first thing to go when you hit 40 is character development.  Oh, and if two 20 year old girls knock on your door, whatever you do, make sure to ask for the $6.99 back for the cost of the rental.",1444348800,4,736,4.638461538461539

7454008,4,B015Y144WE,"I think the reason this film is being trashed by so many reviewers is because this scenario could & probably has happened to men, first off I will say I am not a fan of Eli Roth in any way, his ""Hostel"" films I refuse to watch, I don't mind gore if it serves the story, but those films are just gory for the sake of being gory, at first I had reservations about watching this one, but having seen Ana De Armas in the recent ""Blade Runner 2049"" & being a fan of Keanu Reeves I figured it was time to give this one a look seeing that she is in it & it being a $5.00 add-on-item, I figured why not, because of the reviews I expected to hate this film but was pleasently surprised at how effective its suspense was, suspense thrillers are rare in films these days....now on too the review....

Like many suspense thrillers before it, this is a cautionary tale about a married guy who's wife is gone away for the weekend, it doesn't help that early on she postpones a sex morning with him, so he is sexually fustrated to begin with, but focuses on his work as an architect but then he hears a knock at the door & discovers two women in the rain who are looking for shelter, being a good guy who thinks he is doing a good deed he lets them in & agrees to call them a cab, but while waiting they begin to seduce him, watching him resist the temptation is fun because we know as viewers he is going to cave & cave in he does as he finds them naked in his bathroom & they go down on him & then temptation takes over & a threesome results, it should be noted that the two women are seen naked for less than a minute, not a lot as one reviewer said (were they watching to same movie??) the next morning Reeves wakes up to find the girls in his kitchen making a mess of epic proportions & it is clear they don't want to leave, when he threatens to call the police they say they are underage, eventually he takes them home only to find them back in his home & meaner than ever as they play torturous psychological warfare on him & we are given this morality tale that says that all men no matter how much they love their wife & children, they can never resist temptation when seduced, which appears to be true for the most part & this film like ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987) & ""Derailed"" (2005) before it drives that point home, which is why I think so many are trashing it.....they see themselves in this movie & knows its true.....simply put this is a cautionary tale of morality & why you should never let strangers in your home, I myself actually had 3 girls knock on my door claiming to be part of a church group who wanted to talk to me about Jesus while this movie was in theatres, no way did I let them in, they probably were part of a church group soliciting believers & new members, but I wasn't about to find out......especially knowing about this movie in 2015....however, I think the alternate ending should have stayed simply because they slip up while targeting their next victim....won't spoil it here.

I put this one right up there with films like...

""The Hitcher"" (1986, 2007).....never pick up strangers
Disturbia (2007).....never spy on your neighbors
""JoyRide"" (2001).....never play pranks on truck drivers
""Single White Female"" (1992).....make your rent affordable.

""Knock Knock"" may have some suspension of belief moments, but it is a unique thriller that probably has happened.",1517529600,11,3387,4.362916006339145
7454009,2,B015Y144WE,"Being a die-hard Keanu fan, I had to watch this one.  I'm also a fan of Eli Roth, so I thought it had a bit of potential.  But if I'm honest, I can't say that I genuinely enjoyed the film.  The first half of the movie was pretty good; it had a nice set-up, and everything up to the point where Evan wakes up in the morning is fine, even if you have to invoke a bit of suspension of disbelief to see the situation actually happening.  Where it really started to lose me was when the two girls are in the kitchen acting like complete and utter slobs.  (Eeee-yuck!  I wouldn't have blamed Evan for grabbing a bottle of bleach and taking a bath with it after seeing how they acted the morning after.)

It definitely wasn't a scary movie, though it's not one I would have wanted to watch with my parents around.  Some of the sex scenes would just be awkward to watch with them.  As a whole, I would say the movie was okay, and Keanu's acting is what I enjoyed most about it.  His scenes in the beginning were quite good, but the rest of the movie was lackluster enough that I can't give it more than 2 stars.  The soundtrack was good, but the plot just seemed forced and unrealistic.  And the girls were kinda creepy, and not in the ""we're trying to be creepy"" way either.",1517270400,,1267,4.1687242798353905
7454010,1,B015Y144WE,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever had the pleasure of fast forwarding through. Literally nothing happens for most of the movie, the entire plot could have been a 30 minute Tales From the Crypt episode. The majority of the movie is slow panning and people sitting around talking about nothing important.

7454015,1,B015Y144WE,"This movie is about a married man being forced into a dangerous and chaotic situation. It starts out bizarre but stays within the realm of plausible until about half way.

The two antagonists start running amok and start to deal their punishments for a crime they are ultimately responsible for.",1515715200,,447,4.818181818181818

7454017,1,B015Y144WE,"sucked so bad; nothing believable about any part of the story line, plot, acting, or ending.  The last line of the movie was the cherry on top of this P.O.S.

The girls are fantastic and Keanu Reeves holds well in this! The setting and pacing go really well with the quirky and dangerous atmosphere. Obviously there's unbelievable elements to it but the film seems to even embrace that and own it. Good music, too. Again, fun and wicked! The ending really nails it.",1514419200,,436,4.4625
7454019,3,B015Y144WE,A decent little flick. Not great but an okay watch if you're looking to pass some time. The cinematography and sound design are solid but the script and plot could be better.

The first 5 minutes or so of the movie remind me of a Hallmark or lifetime movie beginning but don't expect that, this movie is kinda horrifying and very crazy.

7454033,5,B015Y144WE,"This movie was scary and disturbing, and ultimately quite entertaining in a close-my-eyes-can't-watch-this-scene kind of way.  Keanu Reeves did a great job, as did his co-players Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas.  I found myself yelling at him when he invited the two 'ladies' inside to dry off and warm up; as we all know no good deed goes unpunished.  Took me a while to figure out why the movie was so disturbing, then I finally realized it is because I am accustomed and desensitized to seeing women routinely violated in films, but not men.  Reading the reviews here it looks like there is a lot of the usual ""Keanu"" bashing, but don't be misled.  He turns in a great performance, as usual.  Highly recommend for those who have the stomach to watch.  Five stars.",1510185600,3,764,4.614814814814815
7454034,2,B015Y144WE,"Keanu Reeves acting was good up until the humiliation scenes. I did not like the two ladies being naked only because if the movie is not at all that good and, i think they know this, they then put naked women to attract more attention. It just cheapen the film even more. A really good movie with a great story and great acting does not need nakedness  from man or women.  I only give it three stars because of Keanu. Those two actress didn't act so well. I would say not to watch this movie. Only because it is cheap and I am sorry that Keanu had to lower his standards.
And, With all these Harvey Weisntein stories and many more coming out, i think even more that this type of stories are very dark desire of producers and writers that they somehow have been part of or would like to in some way , shape or form. I think Hollywood is full of rapist and pedophiles that they project their desires unto a film and get paid for it. And the actors that signed on are just as crazy as them for even repeating lines like the ones on this film. All the stories about Harvey W. and Kevin Space and many more i am sure, have  me double guessing about the intentions behind some films, specially when those films are this dark and obscure. Of course, to not be so obvious they choose women as predators and man as the victims sort of, because even man are sexually harassed in Hollywood.
So, actors, producer and directors and writer film better material and start projecting your dark , obscure and crazy desires on a film and actors please have some standards and a strong identity and don't sign up for this crazy stuff.",1510185600,,1615,4.305921052631579

On the plus side, the plot is somewhat unnerving and suspenseful, which was clearly the goal.  Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo manage to pull off moderately believable performances as deeply disturbed sociopaths, but Ignacia Allamand and Keanu Reeves scarcely make a meaningful impression.  Not that it's entirely their fault: the film is totally lacking in character development, sensibility, and flow, and the ending is so disappointing, poorly done and lacking in imagination that it renders the whole movie a disastrous dumpster fire.
