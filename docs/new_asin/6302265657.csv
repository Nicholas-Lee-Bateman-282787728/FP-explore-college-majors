7823453,4,6302265657,"Deathstalker IV...Quality of film to dvd transfer very good, shots are slightly erratic but acceptable during the battle scenes, audio is dubbed because it was filmed in Bulgaria.  Rich Hill has aged a little since his first acting role in Deathstalker I from 1983.  If your looking for barbarian vixens and drunken warriors this film is made to order.

7823454,1,6302265657,"This fourth entry in the DEATHSTALKER series marks the return of the original hero, Rick Hill.  While Hill is looking remarkably fit for a middle-aged man, his performance is so lethargic it's a wonder why he even agreed to do it at all.  Add the incredibly bad Maria Ford and others, and you get a really bad sword and sorceror flick that makes little if any sense.  Only Brett Clark as the doofus hunk and Michelle Moffett as the evil queen come out with any semblance of acting ability.  Little to recommend this clunker though!",1129507200,2,531,4.557894736842106
7823455,5,6302265657,"I got this movie because I have been a fan of Rick Hill since before his B movie days.  I saw DS1 and thought it was a typical silly B movie, but this one is much better.  The acting is better and it doesn't take itself seriously (as in, in addition to being unintentionally funny, it has some real humor).  Yeah, I'm biased because I'd watch Rick watch paint dry.  But if you like this kind of sword and sorcery with scantily clad chicks in it, (and some hot guys too), it's a lot of fun.",1119484800,5,489,4.0625
7823456,5,6302265657,"This movie is a treasure trove of unintentional laughs... it's really a horrid movie, but so many stupid and nonsenscial events and people surface that you laugh at 'em all.
I suggest the original DS as the best (by  which I mean worst) of the hilariously campy and recycled Deathstalker  series.",922579200,9,296,4.784313725490196
