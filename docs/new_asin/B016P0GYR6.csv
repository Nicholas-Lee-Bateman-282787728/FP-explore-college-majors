The movie had the usual equation: Dad is a blundering idiot, kid looks up to dog more than Dad, dog gets killed, Dad tries to step up but since he is such an idiot his son will never like him, Dad invents robot dog that looks exactly the same as the dead one, and dead dog doppelganger hi jinx ensue.

7476719,3,B016P0GYR6,"10th Dec 2017  - Note Amazon has combined all reviews for DVDs of the both the original Robo-Dog 2015 film, along with Robo-Dog Airborne which is it's 2017 sequel.  I saw the original a while ago and reviewed it back then.  Which is the review below now under that title, but as of 10th of December 2017, I have also added a review of the sequel.  The first is a better movie than the second, simply because it has a villain and more of a plot and more characters.

Robo-Dog (2015 made movie review)

Robo-Dog, is a low budget, mostly unknown actors, film.  Even though I didn't find it there, it reminds me of the budget kids films you find in the $2 display at discount stores in its quality. It isn't great but it is watchable, although not something you'll probably watch a second time. The storyline is very basic, not much happens, its a simple tale, boy's dog dies, father is an inventor who gets fired so he's got a bit of time on his hands, father decides to take apart the car and other household appliances and make a robotic companion for his son that looks exactly like the real dog did.  Robo-Dog has some extra features Dog (the name of the dead dog) didn't have, he has an inspector gadget type human hand arm that can emerge from his side, he can speak in English, he can run really fast, he has incredible strength, can record video through his eyes, can bark loud enough to blow clothes off of a human and has a powerful vacuum cleaner in his butt.  Basically this is one of those movies where the kid learns to be less of a jerk and treat new things (Robo-Dog) better.  There's a side story about the father's former boss who wants his never runs out battery back that the father invented while working for him, which powers Robo-Dog.  Of course it is like Robo-Dog's heart, without it he isn't operational.  A mentally handicapped employee who just wants to please initially the father by bringing him the battery with his personal belongings, and then the boss by kidnapping the dog to get the battery is basically the only villain of the film, and he's not meaning to be really.  One of the few funny moments in this film revolves around him, the vacuum feature and some people walking by in the street.

I'm pretty sure I've never seen the main character actor in anything before, nor the actor who played his father.  But you will recognise Wallace Shawn's face, and more likely his voice (he voiced Rex, Toy Story amongst other things) who is the boss.  I also recognised Olivia d'Abo's face who plays the mother from minor roles in TV shows and movies where she played a teen or well not a mother character in those.  Everyone else is pretty much an unknown, I can't say their acting was that great so it's unlikely we'll see them in much in the future.

The robotic dog looks exactly like a real dog and isn't like Robocop or anything if that's what you were after.  I did find it odd that a kid who has the original Optumus Prime and other 80's toys in his room wouldn't have seen that film and mentioned it as some point.  Being the dog just looks like a real dog they could well have made the same film with the dog being an alien or something.  This isn't a realistic film at all, for example explosions happen and basically the only result is soot on the face and clothes smoking like in a cartoon.  The arm in the dog and some scenes where humans get thrown look like very bad Photoshop jobs.  I found it weird that the boy was into his neighbour, who was a girl who looked like his mother.  On his mum she was just too accepting of every bit of behaviour by her husband such as stripping parts from their car, when he says I got fired, she doesn't seem to care saying ""oh well, I making decent money now.""  The boy also wasn't very likeable.  Also the boss had every right to want his battery back, the battery was developed in his lab, with his equipment, on company time, the law would have been on his side if they went to court.  I'll talk about the ending in a second but basically if you're into dog films and don't mind if the quality of the writing isn't great, this isn't a bad choice.  It passes an hour and a half of time enjoyably enough, but just don't go in expecting a memorable film.

The ending was pretty weak (spoilers follow).  The giant battery looked exactly the same when everyone started to panic, as it did when it was working fine.  When the movie ends, you're thinking, what that was it?  They could probably have had Robo-Dog appear earlier as the movie is already a third over when he appears, Dog (the real dog) took 15 minutes to be killed off, we knew he was obviously going to die, surely that could have happened in the first few minutes so we could have had more Robo-Dog scenes.  (end of 2015 Robo-Dog review)

Robo-Dog Airborne (2017 made movie review)

You could watch Airborne without having seen the first one, the father and son character return played by the same actors, as does the mentally challenged character Kenny.  I imagine the dog is played by the same canine actor/s, it looks the same anyway.  But that's it for returning characters.  The mother is absent from the movie, which isn't explained  If you hadn't seen the first one, you'd just assume the dad is a single father.  There's two new main human characters in this, with another single parent with a young daughter.  This other dad is conveniently a wizz on computers.  Robodog who can now fly but has been ordered not to by the dad, since he crashed and created a big pothole. He and Tyler are attending a science competition in a different city.  The father has to give a talk in New York, so Kenny has offered to drive Tyler there and look after him.  Of course the dad has no confidence in that, so sends Robo-Dog with them, even though he needs him in New York for the final keynote speech.  So the plan is for Kenny to bring the son and the Robo-Dog to New York as soon as the science competition is over. But the guy organising the science competition is dumber than Kenny, and a soft drink experiment goes wrong causing the convention center to be evacuated.  Robo-Dog helps evacuate the kids, but gets hit by a car driven by the new single dad character.  The driver realises Robo-Dog is a machine, and takes him home to fix him.  However he doesn't put back in the memory card, Robo-Dog can't remember his past, the man's daughter loves him and thinks he's her gift, so the father doesn't correct them. Tyler and Kenny set out to find them, but Kenny hampers things.

I'd rate the second movie two stars. There's some obvious green screen going on, such as when we see the other dad driving the car before he hits Robo-Dog.  It just doesn't look real at all.  There's also a bit of blurriness, especially at the beginning of the film when the characters move.

There's also parts of the plot that don't make sense.  Spoilers obviously.  The whole premise is Robo-Dog can't remember his inventor and that family because his memory chip was taken out, and the other dad put in a blank memory card.  So surely that would mean when the old one is put back in Robo-Dog shouldn't be able to remember all the stuff that's happened to him with these new owners.  He shouldn't remember Mia because she was on a different memory card, he definitely shouldn't remember a place they went.",1459209600,,7331,4.413690476190476
