The idea was to give her something that would help her burn off a little energy - and this definitely fits the bill - and from her perspective IT IS FUN!!!",1474675200,,325,4.0625
8040282,4,B00068NWMO,"The crazy names the grown up uses to describe the dances got a laugh out of us and my niece did the routines over and over again. She especially loved the hip hop routine. Each routine gets done a couple of times and gives the kids enough time to practice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got it for her as one of her Christmas gifts and she did it for weeks non-stop, but was tired of it by the time her 8th birthday came around in March. But I guess that's how kids are, right? Lol",1346716800,2,511,3.876190476190476
