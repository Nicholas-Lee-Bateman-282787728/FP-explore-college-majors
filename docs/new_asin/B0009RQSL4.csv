I was planning to show to a bible class, so I sat with my bible to check the accuracy and gave up after 10 minutes because there is just too much that is different. Also, the audio and visual do not line up, which made it even harder to follow.",1506297600,,274,4.092592592592593

8065637,5,B0009RQSL4,"Awesome! Excellent! Understandable, biblical entertainment which depicts historical accuracy straight from the Holy Bible. The best feature length film on the rise of King David of Israel, to date. The film is clear and concise and flows effortlessly, especially the  portrayal of the ever-increasing jealous insanity of King Saul, when he found out that David and not one of his own sons, was his successor. A great family movie for both Christian and secular audiences, alike. Well worth the cost and your viewing time. It's a classic DVD and a definite keeper for your home collection.
