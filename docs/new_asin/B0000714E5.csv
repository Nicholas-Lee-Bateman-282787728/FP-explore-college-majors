1798566,5,B0000714E5,"I haven't seen this movie in over 20 years. The first time I saw it was as part of a Chinese film festival at the U. of Minnesota. It was a massive hit at the time. There are several things I remember about it. The first half was unbelievable, the second half, fairly slow. The cast had great chemistry together. In fact, they tried making a follow-on movie with the same cast, but it didn't fair as well. I'm a big 'Crouching Tiger' fan, but as I recall, it did not push beyond what Zen accomplished. I just hope when I do see it again, that it does not disappoint me like so many 'classic' movies do when I re-watch them long after their initial release(Godfathers I, II, Lawrence Arabia being exceptions).",1040860800,13,708,4.371212121212121

1798599,5,B0000714E5,"I first saw this film in the 1970s when Asian martial arts films were still quite a novelty for me. I really only knew Kurosawra's two films with Toshiro Mifune as the masterless samurai, which unlike SEVEN SAMURAI do not probe the social and moral context of the warrior hero. This Chinese film does just that - as well as having exciting, acrobatic sword fights. The film takes its time and lingers over intimate scenes and scenes with a Buddhist master, who is the most powerful warrior of all but simply beyond the realm of conflict most of us live in. His presence in the film is remarkably moving and spiritual and the climax of the storyline belongs to him. There is also a villain who appears only toward the end who embodies such compressed evil that I found him terrifying. But in terms of action sequences this film is a hoot! They are numerous, varied and unfailingly exciting. All these years later I can recall them in my memory - that is the degree of their vividness. They release a simply giddy kinetic joy while viewing. They are NOT graphically bloody, this is a hymn to force but it does not wallow in gore. It is violence in the service of the good cause, and you will understand that statement fully as you watch with fascinated attention.",1466467200,18,1261,4.535087719298246

The pacing, characterization and storytelling has never been better but be warned, it starts off slow (stay with it), then your pulled into a mystery building toward a crescendo that is all out explosive.

1798658,5,B0000714E5,"Sublime and sprawling, A TOUCH OF ZEN is perhaps the greatest in King Hu's series of ground-breaking, metaphysical period dramas.

Vaguely, A TOUCH OF ZEN is a martial arts film, and it's greatest influence was on other HK martial arts films (and later international crossovers like CROUCHING TIGER, HERO and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS).  But it approaches being martial arts as Tarkovsky would have done it - the film is set up in three methodically paced, long sections (it's a 3 hour film), which all feature a bit of action but devote more attention to character, landscape and narrative.  The focus of each section falls upon different characters, with the central character in each section embodying different virtues:  the humility and creativity of the artist (the focus of the first act), courage and confidence in the second act, and an assured enlightenment in the third.  The three acts are linked by tightly controlled and far more explosive bursts of action in an otherwise meditatively paced film.

Hu explores other elements as well - the first act, mostly devoted to the artist, eases viewers into a framework of intrigues that will shape the plot; this section of the film is very slow, but in hypnotic (and definitely not dull) fashion, with an abundance of careful set detail and some rather astounding landscape photography.  Here, palace intrigues and suggestions of the supernatural (A TOUCH OF ZEN is loosely adapted from a number of Pu Songling's gently surreal stories, collected in ""Strange Tales From A Chinese Studio"") drive the slowly coalescing plot.  Intriguingly, the ghost story elements explored early in the film are satirized a bit later, adding a discrete layer of  obtuse irony and genre commentary to the overall proceedings.

Gradually shifting into a second act, which moves the focus to an imperial fugitive (Yang Huizhen) who is being tracked in the area.  Here another of Hu's advances surfaces - Hu had a knack for creating strong and complex female characters, and the fugitive seen here is one of the most memorable; definitely a touchstone for Ang Lee, among many others.

A TOUCH OF ZEN is divided with an intermission (on the DVD - more on this later) into two halves, and this 'second act' falls on either side of this division.  A semi-famous, and much imitated, action sequence is to be found here.

During the third act, the focus shifts again, to a group of monks that make a brief but memorable appearance earlier, and - as the level of action gradually rises, so does the level of mysticality, with Hu's complex and highly personal take on Buddhism recalling Andrei Tarkovsky's similarly mystical and oblique Christianity.

Throughout, we have Hu's sense of humor, a sort of greatly modified slapstick providing extra charm - the very playful sense of humor would seem to be a strange addition, but it somehow works, giving an otherwise slow, meditiative film a breezy sense of rhythm.  Again, I would point out the influence of Pu Songling (perhaps upon Hu's entire body of work); Songling's work - a classic of Chinese literature, blends spiritualism, surrealism, unexpected humor, political intrigues, horror and hints of the erotic - and Hu is unafraid of blending these seemingly disparate qualities into a vast, and sublime, cinematic endeavor.

This is a beautifully shot film, on my personal short list of the most gorgeous ever, and the US/R1 DVD does present A TOUCH OF ZEN in all of its' widescreen glory.  Unfortunately, the film seems to be otherwise unrestored, with an indistinct print and several spots of faded colors distracting from some exquisite compositions and landscape shots of a variety that would've made John Ford jealous (with at least one explicit visual reference to Kurosawa as well).  I would hope to see a fully cleaned-up DVD available at some point in the hopefully not-too-distant future.

But - grainy DVD or not - this is something every cinephile out there should see.

1798659,5,B0000714E5,"In the first ten minutes I thought it was just okay;

then it did nothing but get better for the next 177 minutes. Director King Hu was a visionary;no wonder so many contemporary movies have explicitly and liberally lifted his ideas.

Unlike so many martial arts' movies, character reigns;

the plot is intricate, evolving and and motivates the action.

And the natural locations make me want to take a very long walk around China. A feeling of reality and naturalness prevails in every scene.

If you buy this, and you should, read the bio of King Hu Jing-Chaun; amazing what he's done and the lasting impact of his work. His genius really shines in Touch of Zen.",1153699200,16,664,4.641025641025641
1798660,1,B0000714E5,"This movie is terrible.  It is three hours of nonsense.  The pacing is so slow that you have to make a lot of use of the fast forward button.  The fight scenes are laughable.  The fighters hop like bunnies.  Every single fight scene in this film, and in almost every other oriental so-called kung fu film, is absolute worthless garbage.  Fast forward through all the fight scenes, which means fast forward through most of the movie.  Also fast forward through all the scenes where nothing is happening.  That doesn't leave much.  They have a 15 minute movie with 170 minutes to skip.  And someone tell me why the two stars of the film look so Caucasian.  Is that the Chinese ideal of beauty?  In the movie they make fun of superstition and belief in ghosts, but at the end they give us a final shot of a godlike image, more superstition.  The star is actually some magical Buddhist abbot.  Gimme a break.  The only good thing about this horse manure is that the leading lady is very cute.  Other than that, I can't think of a reason to waste 3 hours on baloney.  And for all the people who place this idiocy at the top of their all time movie list, I have to question your motives.  Do you want to seem smart?  Is it cool to recognize crap simply because it is from another country?  That is an insult to all the truly great foreign films.  Just cause it's foreign, doesn't mean it's worth a damn.  Placing this trash on a par with the truly great foreign films simply because it is foreign is an insult to the great ones.  This movie, pure and simple, is inferior.  It makes me wonder if the Chinese movie audience has the taste of little children.",1151625600,5,1649,4.366336633663367
1798661,4,B0000714E5,"Included in the Time Magazine Best 100 Films of all time list, A Touch of Zen does not disappoint. Though it starts slowly, the momentum gradually increases until the viewer is completely caught up in the story of a refugee woman who seeks the help of two generals, disguised as common townfolk (one a blind man, the other a doctor), and a group of monks led by an abbot whose spiritual strength is expressed in his ability to thwart violence and defeat evil based on deflecting the advances of his enemy and using that deflection to repel whoever attacks.

This mystical bent is strong in the film and lends it some real juice. Also on hand is a poor artist who lives with his mother, a spy who wishes the artist to draw his portrait, the evil eunuch Hsu, a whole bunch of guards/soldiers in service to both Hsu and his ""boss"" Wei (the equally evil ruler), Mun-Ta (another bad guy), the town magistrate, and, of course, the artist's mother who's on hand for comic relief and as well to provide a touch of humanism to A Touch of Zen. The bad guys had previously tortured and murdered the refugee woman's father and are now out to finish her off, as well as the two generals who have sided with her.

A clear inspiration for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon--as many others have noted--this film boasts quite a few martial arts fights (mainly with swords) and quite a few flying leaps. It's also nice to see that a good looking woman, the refugee, is so adept at martial arts herself--women's lib had apparently hit China before it got to the US!!

This is a three hour film, broken into two parts, so there is actually an opening credit sequence for the second part of the film exactly like the first part sequence and a short (two-minute) recap of the last scene from the first part at the beginning of the second part. In addition, the image is somewhat muddy at times. In spite of these drawbacks (hence the four stars instead of five), this deservedly is part of the Time Magazine Top 100 Film List; it's a gripping story with great visuals and nary a false note anywhere.

Highly recommended.",1140220800,8,2095,4.519788918205805
1798662,3,B0000714E5,"I first heard of A Touch of Zen when it made the run of the art houses in London in the early 80s.  I desperately wanted to see it, but by the time I had a free afternoon, it was already gone.  Since then, I've been waiting anxiously for it to show up, first in repertory cinemas, then on VHS, and then on DVD.

Needless to say I was thrilled to see that the film was finally available on DVD.  I got a copy as soon as I was able, popped it in the DVD changer, and settled back to watch.  Two hours later, somewhat dejected, I found myself wondering whether I really wanted to continue watching this film, since its only remaining appeal to me was as a film history exercise.

All of this film's strong points are visual, and each visual technique has been done better in later films.  It's interesting to see where some of these techniques originated (though some of my Chinese friends dispute whether the techniques were original even at the time), but unlike other films with pioneering visual styles (e.g. ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain""), the plot and characters just don't justify sitting through the whole thing.

Also, the film is often too self-consciously artistic, and definitely too long (or at least too slow-paced)...  Though that could just be me, I suppose; I also thought ""House of Flying Daggers"" was too long and slow.  (In my defense, I did like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"", and I absolutely love all 208 minutes of ""The Seven Samurai"").

I don't think this film was overrated at the time it came out, but its value was entirely in its innovation, and not in the plot, characters, or even the action.  As a result, it just doesn't hold up compared to all that followed.",1136937600,7,1732,4.516025641025641
1798663,5,B0000714E5,"A Touch of Zen is a magical film.  I have never seen anything like this before (or since).  A whimsical tale filled with vengence, redemption, honor and enlightenment.  Everything about this film is a wonder to behold.  King Hu wanted to make a movie that people will never forget once they saw it.  All I can say is that he accomplished what he set out to do.  Originally this movie was over six hours long.

The studio forced him to edit it down to three hours.  To hell with ""Crouching Tiger...""  You want to see a real mystical martial arts/asian zen film then this is the one!

However the DVD presentation is not that spectacular.  A classic like this one deserves better.  But despite it's flaws this is one movie you need to see!  Watch out for a young Sammo Hung, Yuen Wah and Yuen Biao!!

Highest recommendation possible, one of the essentials.",1120262400,19,854,4.496732026143791
1798664,5,B0000714E5,"I went to see ""A Touch of Zen"" in the late seventies at the New York Film Festival.  In all seriousness it was my greatest moviegoing experience in all my years as a moviegoer.  I guess it's because whenever I saw a classic film like ""Citizen Kane"" or ""The Bicycle Thief"" or ""The Godfather"" or whatever, I was prepared to see something great.

But I was totally unprepared for this.  I had never seen anything like it before.  And when Hsu Feng suddenly revealed her ability to fight with this awe-inspired power and grace--not to mention  bound like a gazelle--it hit me with all the beauty and magic of what movies can be.  And it knocked me out to see a woman warrior like this.

Since then of course I've seen many films like this.  ""Crouching Tiger"" quotes many films, but Ang Lee and James Schamus are fans of this one.  But there is also ""The Matrix"" (the shot where Hsu Feng is revealed on the ceiling over the door) and of course, ""House of Flying Daggers"" - the scene in the bamboo forest is totally ripped off in that film.  And of course, countless Hong Kong films. This was the bible.

And I also believe that the painstaking beauty of it's Leone-like compositions, it influenced the new generation of filmmakers like Zhang Yimou.  Other directors of King Hu's time made four films a year.  He spent three years on this.

But the thing to remember is that ""A Touch of Zen"" was completely done before CGI.  Of course there is a lot of old-fashioned cinema trickery, but much of it is just plain old acrobatics.

So I was a little afraid to see what I would think of it decades later. What made the first time work was how unexpected it was. Anyway, I popped in a copy, just to check out how bad the copy was.  I ended up watching the whole three hours, finishing at two am.

I've seen so many other films like this since, but it is still the best.

The copy is just like the ones you see in restoration videos, when they show you how the brilliant color has faded and there are all these scratches, etc.  There is another version of this film that comes from a different company, it's available on Amazon. UK, but you would need an all-region player, which is of course illegal.  It might end up being the same print anyway.  There is another version I've seen at cinflix.com that has no subtitles.

One final note, I actually met King Hu on a Hollywood backlot in the eighties.  He was trying to make a Hollywood film with producers Midge Sanford & Sarah Pillsbury (""Desperately Seeking Susan"")  I guess he was a little too early.  I'm sure there would be a place for him now, but he passed on years ago.",1117929600,34,2617,4.375518672199171

You will be amazed by the outdoor cinematography, and the intense fight sequences will have you on the edge of your seat.

I must confess that, contrary to the critical consensus, I did find it overly long, and the acting of the leading man, quite frankly, grating on my nerves with his frequent silly cackling. There is a very slow and long night sequence in what is believed to be a large, haunted derelict building, a sequence that is supposed to make one's flesh crawl in a terrified but thrilling wait for the ghosts, goblins, or whatever supernatural entities inhabiting the place to manifest themselves and go Boo!, But it only got me impatient for the action to move on, to get over and done with it.
Overall, there are some memorable moments in the movie, that reminds me of some passages in movies by Akira Kurosawa, a contemporary of Hu said to have influenced his work considerably.
Be that as it may, I sadly conclude that Hu, a great martial-arts director and creator, was no Kurosawa, that ""A Touch of Zen"" was no ""Kagemusha"" or ""Hidden Fortress"" or ""Rashomon"", movies that, by the way, are among the great ones of all time, and any one who loves movies should have in his or her bucket list.",1475884800,2,1184,4.642857142857143
