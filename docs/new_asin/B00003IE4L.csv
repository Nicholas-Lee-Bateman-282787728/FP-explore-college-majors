1329984,5,B00003IE4L,"What can I say, those who know Dream Theater know of the ability
and prowess of Mike Portnoy. This video is one of the better vid's I have purchased in the world of drum instruction. The only thing I would like to have seen is a cut away view of the kick pedals to understand what was happening at both ends through the instruction. Besides that, it's a MUST HAVE in the collection.",1001721600,,382,4.2465753424657535
1329985,5,B00003IE4L,"I really enjoyed watch this video set, I think it is a must have for Mike Portnoy fans, but there was not that much advanced instruction, just some double-bass exercises, and he covered odd time signature a little.  Don't buy this video, if you are just interested in learning.  He talks about details of DT and LTE and counts some songs, and play a bunch of them. I really liked it because I just wanted to see him play, but I realized that to me it's not a instructional video.",996019200,,479,4.311111111111111
1329986,4,B00003IE4L,If you are a drummer and a Dream Theater fan this video is a must.  This video shows just how good Mike is and shows what a good guy he is.  His talent is awesome and explains some key parts in many songs.  The solos are  outstanding.,948067200,10,234,3.9148936170212765
1329987,5,B00003IE4L,This video is great. Mike Portnoy breaks down drum parts from Liquid Tension and DT songs and shows how and what is going on. Some parts anwersed questions on how he did some things. The drum solo on part 2 with  audience partipaction shows what a player and gentleman Mike Portnoy is.,944092800,28,285,4.480769230769231
1330008,4,B00003IE4L,"I'd never really heard Dream Theater 3000's music until watching this double set.  Honestly, I'm not a fan of their music style.

But as a drummer, I continually go back to this for reference and technique.  Portnoy is amazing...hands down! And the video is well made.  He breaks down a wide variety of specific licks, grooves and fills throughout the 2 disc set.

I really like this because it gives me a fresh perspective on odd time signatures and fills.  I'm used to playing either 4/4 or 6/4, most of the time, and this DVD brings a new challenge and a new dimension to my playing.

Bottom Line: Highly recommended for any drummer who studies techniques of others, especially if you want to expand in odd time signatures.",1177372800,,726,4.625
1330009,5,B00003IE4L,Very comprehensive and most importantly fun. Don't take my words for it. Polled in a certain drummer magazine as one of the best instructional drumming dvds. 2 thumbs up!!!,1172534400,,172,4.9655172413793105
1330010,5,B00003IE4L,"For all of you who were wondering how the h*** Mike Portnoy creates, rehearses and performs the drums either with Dream Theater or Liquid Tension Experiment, if you want really good tips about timing, odd timing, double bass execution or memorizing really complex pieces of music, you must watch this documentary/exercise dvd.",1167782400,,326,5.288461538461538
1330011,4,B00003IE4L,"I liked it a lot and enjoyed it very much.
The four stars are because on a personal level, I was expecting a little more about the notes Mike takes when writing a song at the studio along with the other musicians, and that is why I was expecting a little more on how do they do it, how does Mike do it.
I recomend this DVD very much, its very entertaining and it does has some very interesting tips and solos. I like a lot the different angle views. If you like drums and progressive music, you have to buy it.",1153872000,,510,4.009803921568627
1330012,5,B00003IE4L,"An excellent video -Portnoy elaborates on his style of play, demonstrating his drum fills step by step, breaking down his patterns.  Definitely worth the money and something you never tire of watching repeatly.",1140912000,,210,5.363636363636363
1330013,5,B00003IE4L,"As a former rock drummer I found this DVD very insightful. Mike, as the whole Dream Theater band, shows his progressive technique in a very understandable manner. Easy to follow, and yet very comprehensive. I fully recommend this to any rock beginner drummer. I've ordered recently another of his DVDs.",1124668800,,302,5.06
1330014,5,B00003IE4L,"Well first off if you know Mike then you know already how bad ass of a drummer he is. To me definelty top drummer all time. I only just recently got into Dream Theater and drumming. When i seen this DVD it was the first DVD i ever bought for drum purposes and man im glad i picked this up. This DVD shows off all of Mike tricks in his band Dream Theater as well as Liquid Tension Exp. What a great DVD to watch. Mike breaks down parts of the songs and gives you step by step fast and slow how to drum the way he does. If want instruction you get it here. He also gives the whole performance of some of his songs and then breaks it down for you. I have a 4 year old and i occasionally watch it w/ him and he is now into drumming. He got a drum set for Christmas and he has been all over it since. Since then i have also purchased Drums of thought, which is break downs of Dream Theaters Train of Thought album. Just a wonderful video of superb drumming that can only come from the best in the business today. Hopefully Mike comes out w/ a video of Dream Theaters latest album Octovarium. We'll see.

Purchase this DVD w/ piece of mind knowing that you will get all the bang for your buck and a lifetime of tricks to learn if your learning to drum. 2Hrs. + of the greatest instructional video to date even though this is already 5 + years old!!!",1122595200,,1343,4.0111940298507465
1330015,5,B00003IE4L,"this dvd rocks. if you are a mike portnoy fan you should most definatly check this dvd out, he not only breaks down his dt stuff but he also breaks down the liquid tension stuff as well. he does a great job of playing everyhting slowly and breaks everything down pretty well. he has lots of great practice tips this is definatly a must have.",1111104000,,341,4.2615384615384615
1330016,5,B00003IE4L,"This is by far the best DVD I have ever bought. Being one of many that look up to Portnoy on drums, I saw this and read all the reviews. When I finally watched it, I couldn't beileve everything on here:Extra concerts, tons of drum solos, many songs from both LTE and Dream theater, and not to mention he teaches you to play some of it. I really love how you can change the camera views on it also. If I recommend and DVD, it is this one FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1107993600,,458,4.1
1330017,5,B00003IE4L,"A great DVD with almost perfect sound and picture quality from prog-king Mike Portnoy,which consists of two discs and over 190 minutes of material and which gives in-depth information about Liquid Tension Experiment and LTE's first studio album, the making of ""Scenes from a Memory"" by Dream Theater and of course the drumming of MP.

However I would not rate this DVD as a ""pure educational DVD"". The educational aspect of ""Liquid Drum Theater"" might disappoint some of the drummers out there, who desperately seeks the key element to play like Mike Portnoy does, or learn the secrets to progressive rock drumming. What you can mainly learn from this DVD tough, apart from Mike's set up and style-including but not limited to- is double-bass playing techniques, hand/feet combinations (which are Portnoy's speciality and he does them like noone else) and some of the fills and rhtyms from Mike's bag of tricks. Mike's solo at the end of Disc 1, which he performed at one of his cliniques, is one of his best so far.

However, I have to add that, whether educational enough or not, I found this DVD to be quite entertaining. To me, this is not just an educational DVD for drummers, but a DVD which anybody who likes music and wishes to witness high quality musicianship would enjoy.

If you are a drummer and like to learn more about the topics summarized above, don't miss it. And if you are a DT or/and LTE fan, whether drummer or not, this is a must have DVD for you.",1107993600,,1470,4.6461538461538465
1330028,5,B00003IE4L,"There is no doubt in my mind that Mike Porntoy is one of the most influential drummers of all time, and this video ""opens up mike's bag of tricks"" and shows the audience the basics of his incredibly smooth fills and  grooves. This video has definatly helped me in terms of breaking stick/feet patterns down, and has enabled me to apply them all over the drum set to create my own fills/grooves. Not only does mike go through many songs from Dream Theater(1st tape/DVD), but he also plays a few songs off of Liquid Tension Experiments albums(2nd tape/DVD). In the video there are also a couple of live performances and drum clinic clips, that keep your mouth dropped to the floor for hours, and not to mention the drum clinic solo at the very end of the first tape/DVD. This DVD is a must have for all Mike Portnoy fanatics, and prog drummers alike...GET THIS FILM CRAKCAHS",1102550400,,872,4.554140127388535
1330029,2,B00003IE4L,"I'm not sure what every other reviewer on here was smoking but in my honest opinion this DVD is over-priced, and under produced. Sure, Mike Portnoy is an experienced, logical drummer, and he probably has a lot to teach, but this DVD is not a great educational tool. In my humble opinion, Dream Theater's brand of 'math rock' or 'geek rock' is very technical (fine if that's what you like) but suffers from it's own efforts. I don't particularly like the music of Dream Theater, who cares, but I still expected to learn more from this DVD.
There are only about 4 discrete lessons in this entire production, and to be brutally honest, they're pretty darn simple. I'm not saying I can nail them all as machine-like as Mike, but they don't take a lot of explaining. The double DVD is just filled with... well.. filler. The amount of effort taken to communicate ideas, and teach, is minimal. I felt pretty ripped off after buying and watching this DVD, which is touted as such an essential educational tool.
There are plenty of good educational productions and products out there. Don't waste your money on this one if you're looking to learn. If you don't believe me, check out how many of these DVDs are for sale second hand! I'd love to get rid of mine too!",1074556800,10,1255,4.557522123893805
1330030,5,B00003IE4L,"This is a wonderful video. Mike Portnoy is an astounding drummer and has had countless acclaim for his work. As the drummer of Dream Theater,he has made a name for himself and become an icon for all drummers like myself. I am a big fan of Dream Theater and am a big fan of Mike Portnoy. I admire his technique and footwork. By watching videos like this,along with any other Dream Theater video,be it live or otherwise,I learn alot from him by watching him. He is one of the greatest drummers of all time and inspires other drummers to be as good as him. When people ask me who I look up to,I say Mike Portnoy. I promote his videos on my personal website, snarncymbl.vze.com. Nobody does it like Mike Portnoy.",1051574400,4,708,4.412213740458015
1330031,5,B00003IE4L,"this DVD shows what this guy is made of.
PURE DRUMMING MATERIAL!!!!!!!!",1036195200,,71,5.0
1330032,5,B00003IE4L,"This is a tremendous video, with all the best angles for watching Mike and his double-bass technique.  He shares with you the beginnings of Liquid Tension Experiment, along with the writing and thought process that's involved with both Dream Theater and LTE. This DVD contains the angle feature during his songs, that show all perspectives.  Mike Portnoy goes into his ""bag of tricks"" and tells you the fills he incorporates in his music, as well as his drum solos.  There is alot of classic footage of Mike Portnoy in the early days of Dream Theater. Did I mention that this is a double DVD? 190 minutes long, with bonus footage! A must have for any Dream Theater fan. Another side note: at the end of the DVD, your given a password that gives you access to all of the sheet music, for all of the songs on these DVDs.",1021766400,24,818,4.476510067114094
1330033,5,B00003IE4L,Three strong words to describe this amazing human being.  Mike Portnoy is a machine.  This DVD is so much worth more than the measley [price] they are asking for.  There is so much extra live footage added and Mike even took the time to give an awesome commentary to an already awesome detailed look at his playing with Liquid Tension and Dream Theater.  I find that Mike does a great job at giving the fans what they want on his own and with Dream Theater.  This man deserves what he has and more as it is evident that he has worked hard to earn every penny and every bit of praise he receives.  What are you waiting for...order it!,1020470400,2,633,4.277310924369748
1330034,5,B00003IE4L,"Realmente un excelente dvd , me quede boquiabierto la rapidez y fluidez con que toca , y mucho mas aun que los ritmos generalmente son distintos y te permite tener una idea variable de las cosas a utilizar ritmicamente. Un gran dvd que recomiendo puesto que se tine la opcion de hacer girar la camara, ponerla hacia un costado y verla desde la vista de los Bombos , ademas de las tecnicas propias de mike en cuanto a la manera de tiempos y enseanza....
No se arrepentiran una muy buena compra...",1016409600,3,495,4.450549450549451
1330035,5,B00003IE4L,"You don't even have to be a drummer to enjoy this set!  It is pretty amazing to watch Mike Portnoy work his way thru some of Dream Theater & Liquid Tension Experiment's toughest work.  I think Portnoy is probably-along with Ted Kirkpatrick of Tourniquet-the best rock/metal drummer ever.  And I'm a fan of Mr. Peart as well.  Anyway, there is a lot of material here to enjoy and it's fun to watch him explain the ideas behind different song parts and drum fills.  Seriously, this guy is just so much fun to watch, you'll forget you are actually learning something!  The highlight for me is the instrumental ""Hell's Kitchen"" named after the NYC neighborhood.  Beautiful.  I can see why this was named ""Instructional Video of the Year"" by a number of drumming publications.  Enjoy!",1013644800,6,779,4.753731343283582
1330036,5,B00003IE4L,"This Two-Disc DVD set is really an improved version of the VHS tapes released two years ago, but now include bonus live performances, an audio commentary from Mike, camera angle switching options and photo gallery.
The cool thing about this DVD set is that it really underlines the potential for the DVD format in the area of instructional videos. For anyone who has used VHS to learn either an instrument or foreign language, you know how difficult it is to keep forwarding and ""bookmarking"" particular sections that you are trying to study. Nobody just watches a video from beginning to end while learning a particular subject. You will want to focus on sections, sometimes for weeks at a time. With the DVD format and chapter breaks, it's simple to do and frankly makes any instructional VHS tape obsolete.
The next fascinating thing about the DVD is the audio commentary. Already there are over 3 hours of playing and instructional information, but with the audio commentary on, you get a behind the scenes view of what it takes to make a video like this. One interesting tidbit was when Mike was talking about how a particular drum sequence was so difficult to get right in one take, that they actually took several different takes of him playing and spliced them together! You would have never guessed this unless you had the commentary on. The other great thing about it is just the ease at which Mike talks to the viewer and lets them in on all the details of being in a working rock band. He tells interesting stories of tours, recording sessions and drum technique. All of this is extremely interesting to practicing musician who just can't hear this stuff enough.
Another technology introduced on this DVD is the multiple camera angles provided in certain sections. Mike is known for his use of double bass work and being able to fix the camera on those sections that are difficult to the viewer is invaluable!
In conclusion, the DVD set is a MUST BUY for any musician hoping to improve their chops or just be entertained by the amazing drumming of Mike Portnoy. My girlfriend, who isn't even a musician, let alone drummer, actually enjoys just watching the DVD because of the great music. There is so much to this deep and useful instructional video that you will continue to view it for years to come.",1006560000,14,2314,4.716049382716049
1330037,5,B00003IE4L,I had the VHS and this is even better. Portnoy teaches drum-fill concepts very well. The added footage of the concerts makes it great.,1003363200,2,134,4.625

7918789,5,B00003IE4L,"Love, love, love this DVD. I actually had the VHS of this many moons ago and played the heck out of them. So when I saw it on DVD, it was a no brainer. Has some really cool shots above and behind his kit and he breaks songs down to show you how to play the drums on them. Excellent DVD!",1391472000,,286,3.7049180327868854
7918790,5,B00003IE4L,"A friend of mine lent me a VHS tape of Mike Portnoy - Liquid Drum Theater. I loved the tape. I wanted to watch it again before I returned it to him. When I did, the tape was jammed in the VCR. The tape was old but I still felt responsible for it. I didn't know what to do. It's not something you can go down the street and get. Being new to computors I Googled, ""Where can I buy music?"". Amazon popped up and the rest was history! The price and quality were above my expectations. As a matter of fact, I bought one as a replacement and one for myself! Thank you, I'll be back.  P.S. If you like drummers, Mike is in the same league with Neil Peart, Dave Weckl, Simon Phillips, Rod Morganstein.......... You get the picture. Enjoy!!!",1326067200,,732,4.154929577464789

7918792,2,B00003IE4L,"This DVD is okay if you just want to watch Mike Portnoy play the songs on the album, but it does not offer much more than an explanation of a few songs. I personally feel that Portony's playing is dynamically limited, and his bass drum chops are weak.

For a great DVD for entertainment and great exercises to improve your chops, control and independence, I recommend Thomas Lang's Creative Control.",1211155200,2,399,4.7
7918793,5,B00003IE4L,"I just ordered In Constant Motion, but I've had this DVD for a number of years. It has an exceptional amount of substance and quality. The disc with the Dream Theater tracks is phenomenal! THe LTE stuff is pretty cool and Mike really knows how to break the complexities of his drumming down.",1181606400,,291,4.509433962264151
