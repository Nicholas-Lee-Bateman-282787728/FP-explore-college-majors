4710875,5,B005J47Q90,"King of Devil's Island, a film by Marius Holst, starring Stellan Skarsgard.  This 2011 Norwegian film tells the true story of the infamous Bastoy Reform School situated on the Alcatraz-like island of Bastoy in the Oslo fjord. Bastoy's school housed delinquent male juveniles aged 11-18 years of age from the 1900 until 1953, who had committed crimes as heinous as stealing out of the church collection box. The events detailed in the film occurred in 1915 with the arrival of 17 year old Erling, a rumored murderer. The bleak Norwegian landscape is beautiful and infuses the film with its cold isolation. We watch as Erling struggles with his individual desire to escape and the devastating consequences for the group. King of Devil's Island is a fascinating look at the development of the individual's attachment to the group. The cinematography is stunning and the entire cast is exceptional. This is a dark, brooding and haunting film; terrifying and brutal, it ends on a hopeful note. Stellan Skarsgard is an exceptional actor who is underutilized by Hollywood. Checkout Skarsgards' performance in Aberdeen to see more of this gifted actor. Highly recommended. This film is NR (Not Rated), but contains graphic violence. Parents are strongly cautioned.",1338422400,,1256,5.187192118226601
4710876,5,B005J47Q90,"Not familiar with Scandinavian films, I didn't know what to expect from King of Devil's Island. The film instantly plunged me into a cold and haunting atmosphere spurred with the rare presence of colors and striking visuals magnifying black and white Norwegian landscapes.

In many ways, I found the story in KODI similar to Haneke's The White Ribbon, both films showing how the moralistic bourgeois education employed at the beginning of the 20th century was only a tool to impose domination. But this film is not a tragedy. With the talent of Stellan Skarsgard and a non-professional cast of young actors, the brutal depiction of a true violent story gains humanity and poetry.

I highly recommend King Of Devil's Island for its stunning cinematography, its breathtaking pace and the emotion of the acting. Combined, they give to the film this powerful impact on the viewer's emotions and thoughts.",1335916800,3,900,5.074324324324325
4710877,5,B005J47Q90,"Something about Scandinavian films always intrigues me. The cold, often bleak atmosphere frequently provides a fitting backdrop to raw and dismal tales. King of Devil's Island is a perfect example of this, from the cold, rugged setting to the intense and unsettling scenarios. To top it off, the film is based on true events which adds that level of realism that really immerses the viewer into the story.

The film takes place on Basty, an island-bound reform school for boys that existed in Norway in the early 1900s. When Erling (Benjamin Helstad) arrives, he's got only one goal on his mind: to escape. Erling is soon enough introduced to the way of the island which is relentlessly led by its governor (Stellan Skarsgrd). The staff rule harshly, enforcing grueling manual labor and crude discipline. Not willing to forfeit his freedoms as a human being, Erling rebels which ultimately leads many other boys to follow suit.

While the governor genuinely seems to believe he's doing good by the boys through his strict demeanor and beliefs, it's apparent his power has gone to his head, causing him to lose a bit of humanity. We see a few scenes with the governor and his wife which was one area of the film I would have liked to have seen more of - I felt like there was a lot more depth there that could have been uncovered. Many of the school staff on the other hand don't seem to care at all for the boys, often treating them as sub-beings. One housemaster (Kristoffer Joner) commits the most foul of abuses which causes tremendous outrage with many of the boys, mainly Olav (Trond Nilssen) - a 6 year resident of the island who befriends Erling.

The abuse and heartlessness of the school staff is hard to swallow, especially when reminding oneself of the true story behind the film. Our character Erling is seen as a rebellious troublemaker to the adults, but to the other boys he's a hero, representing freedom and courage. He is just what the repressed boys needed to instill a sense of hope. As situations heighten, an uprising soon takes place which results in a face-off between the boys and the Norwegian military.

King of Devil's Island had me on the edge of my seat nearly the entire length of the movie. The acting, aside from that of veteran Skarsgrd which goes without saying, is simply superb and realistic. The young and inexperienced cast and the realism they portray are the driving forces behind the film. Every scene of conflict is gripping and intense, while the more subtle moments, especially those between Erling and Olav, are hopeful and almost poetic.

While not a feel-good movie, the film has a lot of what I enjoy including realistic and believable acting and a gripping story that doesn't let up. I can't help but find beauty in the cold and snowy landscape, which makes these types of stories all the more effective. The film is well polished but also feels raw where called for which really helps set the tone for each scene.

The film really leaves one with a lot of thoughts. The story is full of tragedy but still offers amounts of hope for the viewer. I found myself feeling all kinds of emotions throughout. Part of me sympathized with the governor, I understood his intentions but felt his approach was misguided. I also felt for the boys, who must have felt discarded and unwanted by society. What King of Devil's Island does so well is that it combines great storytelling with effective performances that really evoke the viewer's emotions by really making us feel for the characters and getting us involved in the story. Combining my love for Scandinavian movies and movies based on true stories, King of Devil's Island did not disappoint and really stuck with me.

4710878,5,B005J47Q90,"I was gripped and impressed, and wasn't expecting to be so connected to the characters, sympathizing through their pains and victories.  This film is definitely one to watch.  Trond Nilssen's performance as Olav, who is the leader of the boys' barracks that the film highlights, is especially great.  I found myself rooting for all the boys on the island.  Of course Skarsgrd's acting doesn't fail, or the film's young, rebellious leading man, Erling played by Benjamin Helstad.

The film is worth every minute you spend in front of that screen.
""Edge of your seat"" is an understatement.",1333584000,4,587,5.010309278350515
4710879,5,B005J47Q90,"KING OF DEVIL'S ISLAND (Kongen av Basty) is an experience more than a film.  It dares to take the viewer where all is black and white, emotionally and visually, and while the film is shot in color, the only moment of color in this dark, atmospherically eerie snow bound island boys prison is the occasional blood and fire that creates even more of an impact because of the bleak screen that serves as background for the story. Based on a true story by Mette M. Blstad and Lars Saabye Christensen and adapted for the screen by Dennis Magnusson and Eric Schmid, the fine cast is directed by Marius Holst.

In 1915 on the island Basty, located in the Oslo fjord, live a group of delinquent, young boys aged 11 to 18 in the Basty Boys Reform School. The boys daily, sadistic regime is run by the guards and Governor Bestyreren (Stellan Skarsgrd) who is stern but seemingly fair in his management of the reform school (his wife lives with him in an opulent manner).  But the Housemaster, a smarmy pedophile names Master Brthen (Kristoffer Joner), is cruel and malicious and bestows both mental and physical abuse on the boys: the boys are used for cheap manual labor rather than being schooled and `corrected' to return to society. The boys attempt to survive by adapting to their inhumane conditions. One day a new 17 year old boy, Erling who is assigned the `name' C19 (Benjamin Helstad), arrives with his own agenda: how to escape from the island. How far is he willing to go in order to get his freedom? There is a stalwart lad Ivar/C5 (Magnus Langlete) who is due for release and a rather frail lad Olav/C1 (Trond Nilssen) who falls victim to the Master: these lads are C19's colleagues. After a tragic incident takes place, Erling ends up forced into the destinies of the other boys by leading them into a violent uprising. Once the boys manage to take over Basty 150 government soldiers are sent in to restore order. How he maneuvers the escape fantasy brings a surprising ending to the story.

The acting is first rate from a fine group of young actors.  The cinematography is by John Andreas Andersen and the haunting musical score is by Johan Sderqvist. In Norwegian with English subtitles. A moody, deeply moving work.  Grady Harp, February 12",1330300800,6,2249,4.652392947103275

I have seen him in many Swedish films and am a big fan. Like a Bergman film it is dark and shows the harshness of life, the brutality and the humanity of man.  It is not a pleasant film to watch but beautifully acted.  The characters are three-dimensional and you can feel for them.  Even the Governor who at one point I felt was not bad surprised me.

SPOILER ALERT!

I was amazed that so many soldiers with rifles were sent to put down the insurrection of the inmates who were young boys.  But I am sure the Governor had his revenger.

4710890,5,B005J47Q90,"King of Devil's Island is a 2010 Norwegian film directed by Marius Holst. I noticed this movie under the Amazon Prime feature and due to the five-star rating, I decided to take a chance and watch it. This movie is thought-provoking and emotional. King of Devil's Island is based on the true story of a student uprising that occurred at the infamous Basty Boys Home correctional facility in Norway. The island is in the middle of nowhere and the boys are surrounded by the harshest conditions possible. They are also subjected to abuse, lice inspections, solitary confinement and diets of raw fish-heads. I do not wish to create any spoilers however, I will say I recommend this movie. The characters are well developed and Benjamin Helstad is the epitome of a hunk.  Although the movie is subtitled, it was very easy to stay focused and engaged because there is action in almost every scene. Overall, King of Devil's Island is full of drama, tragic occurrences, and emotional scenes that will cause you to feel empathy for each and every prisoner. This movie is also considered to be of the dark and depressing genre. To think of this movie as being loosely based on a true story is a real eye opening experience.

4710899,5,B005J47Q90,"The King of Devil's Island centers on the isolated island boys home of Bastoy in 1915 Norway. Actually, it is a veritable prison for minors, as we soon find the character Olav has already spent six years there. That's right, SIX YEARS. The mood of the film is one of unending cold compounded by the solitude not only of the island itself, but the inner angst of the inmate boys as expressed on their numb faces. Not only does the island setting make you feel as lonely as the inmates, but so does the outward unfeeling demeanor of the administrator and his staff -- and it doesn't let-up, nor should it.

Stellan Skarsgard is his usual high-quality self in the role of a deceitful, faux-caring administrator of Bastoy. Under his somewhat watchful gaze, Bastoy has become a brutal, nightmarish corner of the world tucked away from view. As events play-out, we find he has allowed his staff to administer needlessly-mean punishments on the boys for years to the point that it has become commonplace and unquestioned. We also find out that a certain member of the staff has more than an interest in just disciplining the boys.

Erling is one of two new inmates and he is physically developed and mentally rebellious to a fault. Tasked (by the Bastoy staff) with attempting to get Erling to be more compliant is longtime inmate Olav, whose release may be granted soon. The development of these two characters is magnificent to watch as you cringe at certain actions of theirs' but later root them on as they psychologically ""free"" themselves of the repressive brutality of Bastoy. All of this is in preparation for their ultimate (and unplanned) crescendo. This film isn't a ""laugher,"" but it is simply great film making.

Oh and that ""rape culture"" I mentioned in my title is one no one seems to want to talk about: the rape of boys by perps of any/all ages. Typical how women get all the attention yet again on a subject that has effected countless boys before they reach a troubled adulthood, isn't it? There are campaigns to prevent rape of females, but where are these campaigns for boys?",1476144000,,2089,4.702185792349726

4710938,5,B005J47Q90,"Pros: the acting, the acting, and the acting. Since Good Will Hunting, Stellan Skarsgrd has quietly added considerable and growing weight to so many projects. I'm thinking Spacey, Hoffman and Fiennes-type stuff: you know it's coming and have the highest of expectations, yet they still manage to pull you in and have fun with your thoughts and emotions at their whim.  That being said, the rest of the cast, particularly the group of young actors, was absolutely amazing. I don't know where they found these kids, but they are so impressive and carried the entire film effortlessly. Benjamin Helstad - just wow. It's one of those movies put together so well that after 2 minutes you forget you're reading subtitles. (""The Man From Nowhere"" is another excellent example).

Cons: **Semi-Spoiler Alert** I realize this was based on a true story, so maybe there wasn't room to maneuver, but the movie was doing so well until the issue of money came up. Why on earth... just no. Money had no place in the movie and it arguably didn't even fit the character. I understand something had to cause a certain someone's return, but in my opinion the embezzlement thing was crass and took away from the far deeper and dramatic rest of the story.

Does it deserve less than 5 stars as a result? Perhaps, but in the end I think the fantastic acting and directing deserve 5-star appreciation for their incredible work.",1431302400,2,1403,4.789256198347108

4710947,5,B005J47Q90,"This film is a poignant testimony to a historical side of modern, progressive Norwegian society that is meant to make its viewers uncomfortable with how the nation once dealt with its young-offender population. The filmmaker takes us into a harsh world where a puritanical society is determined to subject its juvenile delinquents to a corrective regimen where the evil in them would be gradually replace by goodness. The setting for this production is the grounds of the old bleak Bastoy Reformatory out in the middle of the Oslo Fjord and the time was 1915. The inmates of this prison were young lads that needed some behavioural modification fast. One resident, Olaf Erling, is one who will find it hard to accept the Christian discipline being imposed on him because it is cruel, demeaning, and oppressive. We get to follow this young mans efforts to break loose from this wretched environment as he attempts a couple of unsuccessful escapes over some incredibly rough terrain. The elements are definitely stacked against this very determined lad. The climax in the film is reached with an uprising of the boys that is ultimately quashed by the Norwegian marines. I find this cinematic work to capture all that is real about the Nordic world of man clashing with nature: a foreboding sense of trouble: a remoteness of location that expresses a leaness of soul; and a hardiness of spirit that bespeaks an heroic determination to overcome great hardship. This title accomplishes all this with a complement of good acting, great plot, and compelling theme",1362096000,,1556,5.011583011583012

I am sorry maybe it is because I have not been in dire straits before, but I sat down thinking this movie was about boys being prepared to enter Hitler's army (horrfic), or about boys in some concentration camp (Profoundly sad). The only thing this movie was about was boys in a Juvenile delinquent type facility and the people in charge not properly taking care of them. Yes, the dude molested the boys but that was one person. You mean to tell me he molested every single one of them? Another thing when they took over the camp didn't they think the brigade would come in? And since the governor brought it up in one of the conversations, would the boys prefer prison instead of the facility? To me in prison their arse would of been raped most likely as well.

4710951,5,B005J47Q90,"I decided to blindly stream this on Netflix today (available as of 11/22/12) and enjoyed it immensely. King of Devil's Island tells the story of Erling, Olav, and the rest of the youth located at Basty, a prison-like island for adolescents, and the mistreatment and torture they endured. It's a powerful tale based on true events, and it's one worth watching.

The first thing you'll probably notice is how beatifully shot the film is. For such a darkly-themed film, this movie looks amazing and creates the perfect atmosphere. The story was engaging and works off of immersive dialogue; I was fully engaged from the intro to the stunning conclusion, which I really enjoyed; I won't spoil any of the scenes this time around, but there are some tearjerker worthy scenes in this film. The movie has an amazing performance from Stellan Skarsgrd, although I feel he was a bit underutilized; Kristoffer Joner also had a brilliantly sinister performance. The entire film is complimented by an enchanting soundtrack; an often dark, and even chilling, soundtrack.

Overall, I highly recommend this film. It's a powerful and often disturbing drama with amazing acting, music, and direction.

King of Devil's Island has strong violence and blood, some nudity.",1353542400,,1249,5.112745098039215
4710952,5,B005J47Q90,"The King of Devil's Island is an incredible exploration of the grand human themes of brotherhood, suffering, hatred, and hope. The production quality was astounding- particularly the desolate atmosphere and wintery landscapes that embodied the emptiness of being confined. Skarsgard's performance, as usual, was perfectly suited to the austere 'Governor' who is at once the stern upholder of order and discipline and at the last a selfish coward. Leaving the Sigur Ros montage aside, this will be a film I will return to for years to come.",1353196800,,539,5.206896551724138
4710953,5,B005J47Q90,"This is a Norwegian film from director Marius Holst and is based on actual events which took place in 1915 on Bastoy Island. It was then a correctional facility for adolescent males. It is in Oslo fjord and was run as a home from 1900 to 1953 and is still today a minimum security prison.  The film deals with events that occurred in 1915. Erling is a seventeen year old who is sent to the prison. He is given a new name C19, all personal effects are removed, hair shaven etc.

The boys are supposed to be turned into good Christians by the regime in order to be released. This is indeterminate sentencing, as it is the Governor who decides when a boy is redeemed and can go back into society. The regime is one of hard physical labour, meagre and poor rations and both physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the house masters. C19 is one of those who decides that it is not the sort of place he wants to remain and so sets about planning to escape from the freezing hell hole.

What ensues is a tale that mirrors quite a few films that have gone before such as `Scum' and `Evil'. The Governor played brilliantly by Stellan Skarsgard tells the boys `escape is a childish fantasy', and for me that is pivotal to the whole film. This was shot in 54 days and the boys are not `professional' actors but this really works. No one is a passenger and the tension is palpable throughout.

It is one of those films that seem shorter than it is and when you consider this is based on actual events it makes it all the more engaging, in Norwegian with good sub titles, this is a real and visceral film that deserves more attention than it received.",1352678400,7,1640,4.297734627831715
4710954,4,B005J47Q90,"I was held captive by this movie throughout its entirety.  As others have stated so well, the acting and cinematography go so well with the reserved, quiet actions of its characters and their remote setting.  The movie expertly implies the hidden sufferings and desires of its characters before showing the consequences of all their actions.

The story within the story of the great whale and its gallant fight to survive harpooners' attacks is masterful in giving this movie its theme and deeper meaning. The whale story is alluded to from beginning to end as the roles of the captain, crew and whale seem to alternate throughout.

Though I enjoyed the straight-faced, unsentimental look of all at Bastoy Reform School, I expected more desperation by the boys earlier in the movie.  But then again, the movie does a great job building the subtle anger and desperation of its characters to a climax. Hollywood could learn much from this movie.  Sometimes less is more when it comes to telling a story.  Well done Norway, well done!",1352505600,2,1031,4.890804597701149
4710955,5,B005J47Q90,"The director, Marius Holst, and the large cast have created a movie that needed to be told. The brutal treatment and abuse suffered by the inmates of a reform school for boys, located on an island in the Oslo fjord, Norway, was not only horrific but demonstrative of the tragic public and academic ignorance about the causes and corrections of juvenile delinquency that prevailed a hundred years ago. This movie is visually and emotionally visceral. How much of it is true is undocumented but the plot is based on actual events. The institution was operating from 1900 to 1953 and having grown up nearby I can say that ""behave yourself or you will be sent to Basty"" was a threat routinely voiced by adults to my more rambunctious peers. It did put the fear of the devil into little boys.

The Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgrd has the main role as the Governor of the school. His acting is superbly crafted to the role. The cruelty of the headmaster is also portrayed with convincingly chilling skill. But the young actors who portray the boys who instigate the rebellion deserve the biggest accolades. It was necessary for this movie to be abruptly blunt in its imagery and consequently it is not for the squeamish. Photography and music intensify the grittiness. The dialogue is in Norwegian and Swedish with English subtitles.",1348963200,2,1326,4.815789473684211
4710956,5,B005J47Q90,"Let me state upfront that I am a long-time fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies (in fact earlier this year I finally gave in and started my subscription). I recently was shopping at the foregn movie section of my local library and when I saw this. I immediately picked it up.

""King of Devil's Island"" (116 min.) is a 2010 release out of Norway. It bring the (true) story of a reform school located on Bastoy Island in Southeastern Norway. The movie starts with the arrival of a young man named Erling at the reform school. Let's just say that Erling is not suited well in this strict disciplinary (if not abusive) environment, and almost immediately he is planning his escape, almost Alcatraz-like. In fact, Erling does manage to escape! At this point, we're only 40 minutes into the movie. To give more of the plat away would really ruin your viewing experience, but let's just say that there are quite a few more dramatc moments to come.

The real star of the movie for me is the scenery, which is stark, and the photography, which is rich even in the many dark and gray scenes. Thie movie proves once again that a foreign movie doesn't have to be ""boring"", even if if doesn't have any CGI scenes in it. If you like a sophisticated, spellbinding foreign movie, ""King of Devil's Island"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1344643200,,1335,4.558333333333334
4710957,5,B005J47Q90,"The King of Devil's Island is a brutally powerful movie that reminds us yet again that many of us live our lives governed by unjust and unforgiving people and institutions that happily benefit from our suffering.  Yes there is decency and caring in this film, but they occur episodically and against all odds within a context so hard and destructive that humane impulses are invariably short-lived, sometimes terminated by death, and otherwise smothered under depravity, greed, cowardice, and indifference.

Given this background, the script is exemplary.  The black and white setting is so cold and forbidding that one can feel it's unyielding grip while watching at home, as the actors play their parts to perfection.  It's understandable that viewers would be moved by moments of compassion and sharing, and that they would be be thrilled when the oppressed finally turn on their oppressors and, if only briefly, take back their lives.  The fact that they do so without the hate-filled drive for vengeance that one might expect is either admirably humane or disingenuously self-mortifying, I can't decide which.  Maybe it's just a byproduct of chronically under-fed boys preferring to wolf down stolen sausages before they think of violent retribution.

Either way, there is nothing to celebrate.  The iron-fisted rule of a corrupt administration is restored in short order.  While one of the strongest boys drowns after falling through a soft spot in the ice, a ship bringing agents of state oppression smashes through a frozen fjord and rounds up those who remain, returning them to the reform school's comfortless barracks.

After watching The King of Devil's Island, anyone who takes solace in small victories in impossibly painful circumstances as evidence of the strength and durability of the human spirit is, I think, missing the point and succumbing to sentimentality.  The dead are dead.  The brutalized are brutalized.  The powerful remain powerful.

Yes, the King of Devil's Island ignites sparks of decency where they would seem least likely to occur.  As with so much of the good in our world of six billion, however, the promise of a more humane existence is quickly stomped out.

This is a truly fine film in every respect.  It is not, however, a hopeful film, but one that speaks truth to damnation and does so with no effect, an example of broadly applicable Norwegian realism at its very best.",1343174400,3,2415,5.088832487309645
4710958,5,B005J47Q90,"I'm still trying to put into words how I feel about this film.  It is so much deeper and more fulfilling than I initially expected and so I'm still piecing together exactly what it left me with.  I was really expecting a more generically constructed film; a film that was more on the clich&eacute;d and genre side of things.  With a quote like ""Skarsgard is terrifying"" pasted on the top of the poster, my mind blocked in the possibilities and basically centered on `young boys are treated harshly by heartless man' with no wiggle room for what I was really presented with.

Marius Holst is a genius.

`King of Devil's Island' tells the true story of the Bastoy Boys, young men sent to Bastoy Island to a correctional facility where their childish ways are to be worked out of them.  The facility is governed by a stern yet complex man (there is so much more behind those eyes than one could imagine).  Bastoy is shaken with the arrival of two youths, Erling and Ivar.  Erling is a repressed soul, rough and not one who easily bends to authority.  Ivar is a quieter and more impressionable young man; easily taken advantage of and almost instantly becomes the target of a housefather with questionable intentions.  Erling comes under the wing of Olav, a fellow Bastoy Boy who is a few weeks shy of getting his ticket home after spending six long years on the island.  As the days pass and Erling continually bucks authority, refusing to learn the rules, life is turned upside down when the morals and convictions of the boys and those in positions of power is questioned and confronted.

The script is fantastic, dissecting the raw humanity found in each of the film's main characters.  Holst's direction is a major asset for he understands how to mold such intensity between the lines.  The homoerotic nature of the scenes, the way that the boys are framed, is just insanely inspired.  The scene in the washroom between Erling and Oystein is a marvelous example of using a subtle sensuality to dig into the heart of these young men.  The cinematography is some of the best of last year; so crisp and cold and emotionally compacted.  The way that these scenes are framed and the almost washed out color pallet adds so much weight to the proceedings.

But this film is really a showcase for some stunning performances.  Stellan Skarsgard is breathtaking.  The way he edges out an entire backstory with mere facial shifts and emotional stares is remarkable.  While his lips are moving you can watch his eyes betray his words with a confliction that is hard to express adequately, and he manages to do so effortlessly.  He reminds me here of his `Melancholia' co-star Kiefer Sutherland.  Both actors (in these respective roles) balance out the desire to lean on the paternal yet the flawed way in which circumstance can derail even the best of intentions.  But, it is the youth in this film that really shine.  Morten Lovstad is saddled with a seemingly clich&eacute;d role as the resident bully, but he builds so many layers with barely a word to the point where his character's arc is beautifully sincere.  Benjamin Helstad helms with film with such bridled intensity, it is unforgettable.  The way he cycles his character's actions with his intentions is beautiful to watch.  But, this film belongs to young Trond Nilssen who just blew me away with his portrayal of Olav.  The slow burn, that build of character, the turning point, the breakdown, the final frame; all of it sent shivers down my spine.

`King of Devil's Island' sounds like a generic film.  It has the ring of a teen film about aggression with shallow development.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  With rich character development and a beautiful understanding of visual depth, this film is unforgettable.",1341446400,16,3780,4.766153846153846

4710960,5,B005J47Q90,"Set in 1915, Marius Holst's drama ""King of Devil's Island"" (""Kongen av Basty"") starts with 17-year-old boy Erling (Benjamin Helstad), sent to Basty Boys Home, a real-life correctional facility that existed in Norway from 1900 to 1953. What the newly arrived boy committed outside the island is not very clear. What we know is that Erling (his assigned number C19) is determined to escape, like Steve McQueen's character ""Papillon""

The ""model"" inmate Olav or ""C1"" (Trond Nilssen) does not understand Erling's rebellious attitudes. Olav believes it is impossible to escape, let alone revel against Bestyreren (Stellan Skarsgrd), strict governor of the facility. But things take a drastic turn when some terrifying secrets about the facility are revealed.

Stellan Skarsgrd is brilliant as governor Bestyreren trying to protect the system he is determined to believe in. With his barely-concealed hypocrisy he clings to the remnants of ideals he knows are lost. Skarsgrd gives depth to this complicated character, which is something he is rarely given a chance to do in Hollywood-made films.

""King of Devil's Island"" works both as a parable of powers, and a story about friendship. Probably you have seen films with similar themes and settings. That does not mean that intense and chilling ""King of Devil's Island"" is only recycling worn-out themes. The film's strength lies in the realistic portrayals of people, teenagers and adults alike, trapped in this small island where everyone, everything stopped moving on.
