1178394,5,B0000039NC,"I loved this movie. It's rare that a film manages to combine social commentary (a bitter indictment of racism) with romance, glamour, suspense, beautifully photographed locations, mysticism, and complex characters. The racism element added depth to what otherwise would have been a steamy, trashy potboiler along the lines of a Sidney Sheldon or Jackie Collins novel. As it is, this film is all the more moving because so many scenes are based on truth: Queenie is based on the life of part-Indian Merle Oberon who managed to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 1930s by passing for white. However, unlike this fictionized version (spoilers here) Oberon was never able to come to terms with her heritage and there is no way she would have been able to work in Hollywood again as a leading lady had she done the brave actions her fictionized heroine does here (see the scarcity of Indian actresses in today's Hollywood cinema as an example). Kirk Douglas plays a surprisingly sympathetic if ruthless movie director, based on Alexander Korda, and his death scene at the end is shockingly realistic. The scene in which Dawn must pretend her mother is a maid is also based on truth. While Oberon of course never accidentally killed anyone, I liked how the murder subplot (which is not really the focus of the film) added urgency to Dawn's hiding of her identity. Great care was taken with this production, and it shows. A great film that inspires anyone of any race to be true to his/herself.",1308268800,13,1499,4.836575875486381

Later on as Queenie rises to the heights of Hollywood superstardom, she gets an offer to star in a film which is to be filmed in Calcutta...
Queenie is based on the the novel by Michael Korda.
The first part of the film shot about Queenie's early years are much more interesting than the years that follow ... in London & Hollywood.
A moving picture, with great performances.",1021334400,26,526,4.728260869565218
1178399,4,B0000039NC,"When I first saw Queenie, I was immediately struck with the masterful depiction of British India.  The bitter racial prejudice that permeated the environment was exceedingly well portrayed in Queenie's life story.  It  emphasized the ridiculousness of racial superiority, as Queenie was part  Indian, yet no one could tell so merely by her appearance, as she looked  quite white, and was treated thus by those who did not know her ancestry.  This superficiality of skin color was a fantastic motif in the movie.  Besides being rich in historical culture, however, Queenie also succeeded  in being a movie about the power of the individual--Queenie persevered  against all odds, fighting herself as well as her environment, yet at the  end she is able to accept herself, and be proud of her heritage as well.  In essence, this movie is a unique and classic archetypal story, richly  done, and laudable.",963446400,12,901,5.054421768707483

1178409,5,B0000039NC,"This is a fabulous movie - one I saw on Tv years ago, but never forgot, and which I hunted for on Amazon, and happily found. It's the story of a young half caste British/Indian girl named Queenie, who is born in India, and whose looks don't show the Indian side of her heritage. Her mother sends her to a proper British School in India, and she tries to bring her daughter up as British. Some ugly incidents happen, which cause Queenie to have to go to England in a great hurry, where she struggles but eventually finds work at several different jobs, over a period of time, until finally, she makes it in the movie industry and becomes famous as a beautiful British movie star, but under a different name. Unfortunately, a previous nasty incident in India, raises it's ugly head and threatens to unravel her new life.",1348531200,5,818,4.496644295302014

7902509,4,B0000039NC,"Review of Queenie
Hot Toasty Rag, January 18, 2018

When I started out watching the 4-hour miniseries Queenie, I thought Id certainly turn it off after the first fifteen minutes or so. How could an epic period piece starring the girlfriend in Ferris Buellers Day Off be any good? Well, my apologies to Mia Sara, because not only was Queenie riveting, but she gave a very good performance as well!

The miniseries starts off with Kate Emma Davies as young Queenie, a fantastic look-a-like for Mia Sara. Shes half Indian but passes for white; but she gets teased at school and shunned by white society. All she wants is out of life is to become a movie star. She doesnt have a crush at school, and shes not aware of any sex and power struggle between men and women. Unfortunately, because shes so beautiful, men cant keep their hands off her, starting with her schoolteacher. Throughout the episodes, when Mia Sara takes the lead, its heartbreaking to watch Queenie change her life view. Because shes continually objectified and desired by men, she learns that she can use her body to get other things she wants, and she turns into a completely different person. Its tragic, but also true to life and quite fascinating.

I don't want to spoil the plot, because Queenie has such an eventful life and comes in contact with so many interesting characters, but I highly recommend this miniseries if you like the genre. With seasoned veterans joining the supporting castKirk Douglas, Claire Bloom, Joss Ackland, Joel Grey, Martin Balsam, Sarah Miles, Topol, and Leigh Lawsonevery scene is well-acted and compelling. I was on the edge of my seat during Queenies journey, and just like every great miniseries, theres sadness, suspense, romance, violence, secrets, blackmail, and the perfect tying of all loose ends. For a very fun weekend with your mom, rent Queenie, light a fire, and bring out the china tea set!

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since there may or may not be a rape scene, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1516233600,,2058,4.805084745762712
