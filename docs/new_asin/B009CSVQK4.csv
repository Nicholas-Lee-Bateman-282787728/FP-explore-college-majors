8539676,5,B009CSVQK4,"Tony Manero is the perfect sociopath and Larrain captures the type to perfection. Very creepy yet engaging. Tony can fool 'em all and gets his form of justice. The A/V is very good and suits the film.  Post Mortem is equally effective and likewise captures the sociopathic personality. Political oppression is the the theme of the film but the lead character is quite the chameleon to behold. The A/V is ok here, but  does not take away from the experience.  Pablo Larrain is an excellent director and I look forward to his next film.",1374278400,2,534,4.659574468085107
