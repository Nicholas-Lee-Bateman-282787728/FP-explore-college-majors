4898625,5,B005W2BVX6,"When I first viewed this series, it was in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and I was totally blown away! The characters are pretty darn cute, the fan service is there-but at a minimum. However, the gags are non-stop and one hardly gets time to catch their breath between giggles and full-blown belly laughs! The premise starts almost like that of ""The Little Mermaid""...and things really get twisted from there! Our mermaid does save a young boy from drowning-but her father is head of an underwater Yakuza clan sworn to destroy any mortal who even catches a glimpse of them. So our hapless hero must agree to be the fiance of the cute little mermaid or face being wiped from the face of the Earth along with his entire family...what's a poor boy to do? Between the rival suiters, the mermaid king's hitmen, and the curious school mates questions as he brings his fiance to school are enough to test anyone's metal! Will the two lovebirds-er-fish ever rise above the mayhem and discover their true feelings for each other, or will our hero wind up as fish bait?!
There's plenty of action, some cute romance, a supporting cast of crazies, and more jokes than you can keep up with-so watch it twice to catch the stuff you miss the first time! Thumbs up for this one!",1325721600,25,1278,4.634361233480176
4898626,5,B005W2BVX6,"This is one of the funniest anime you must own. For me I laugh so many time see this show there is a little fan service in it but not to much but when there is it pretty funny when it dose happen. This show is a love comedy  about a boy named Nagasumi who drowned and get saved by a mermaid named Sun and in the law of mermaid if a human sees a mermaid the mermaid must be but to death but if the mermaid would married the human who saw there mermaid form the mermaid would live and that where the title come from (My Bride Is a Mermaid). So Nagasumi owns sun and this is how this love comedy start oh to even make this show even more funny sun is a daughter of a mafia gang so it get really funny really fast. If you are looking for funny, love, or need to see a new anime comedy well this right up you ally. So you should get this now because once you get this you won't want to take this out of your dvd/bly-ray player anytime soon vary recommended it worth buying check it out.",1325462400,5,981,3.8805970149253732

4898631,4,B005W2BVX6,Went in a different way than I thought it would be  but extremely funny. Gets ridiculous after awhile but towards the end remembers it has a plot. expect a loose plot line crazy humor and a terrific end. Also great work by Alexis Tipton,1360022400,,236,4.363636363636363

4898634,5,B005W2BVX6,"The title of the anime might push one away at first, but the comedy factor this anime provides is awsome, as well as the moments when it gets serious as that's when things start to really get intense, definitely a good watch.",1357084800,,225,4.380952380952381
4898635,5,B005W2BVX6,The story reflects upon the japanese culture of honor.  The boy becomes a man as he learns to become a man by living the Yakuza's code of honor.

4898636,5,B005W2BVX6,My Bride is a Mermaid is in my opionon very cool and fun. I mean here you see a young boy getting saved by a beautful mermaid then he has to marry her or else die. I mean the way they did the expressions for the characters is hilarious. I think they should make a season 2 because it would be interesting to see how things have changed with lunar and the others.,1351814400,,362,3.9726027397260273
4898637,4,B005W2BVX6,"I've watched my fair share of Anime's over the years and although this one wouldn't find its way into my top 5 or even 10, it still delivers a fun story to watch. The main male character was fairly annoying at times, but I always found myself pulling for him anyway. The lead female character was a nice complement to the lead male in terms of personality. The episode structure was predictable at times but was also full of its own suprises. Overall I would reccomend this anime to anybody looking for a fun and wacky adventure.",1351814400,,529,4.463917525773196
4898638,5,B005W2BVX6,"This is one of the funniest anime I have seen in a while! The expressions they draw for the characters are priceless, the jokes are over the top and hyperbole abounds. This show covers about any awkward relationship situation there is and does it well and keeps the jokes fresh while doing so. I picked this up as an impulse buy just to see what it was since it was on sale at the time. I'm glad I did! It turns out that gangsters, mermaids, and teen angst make a good recipe for absolute wackiness. I have already re-watched it once, which I usually don't do soon after finishing a series for the first time. If you want a break from serious character, story driven anime pick this up, hit play and get set for a fun time. Definitely a nice series to have sitting in your collection to pull out from time to time as a palate cleanser or a good laugh.",1351641600,,851,4.226993865030675
4898639,4,B005W2BVX6,"Nagasumi is saved from drowning by a mermaid named Sun. Mermaid's are put to death if a human discovers their true form. In order to save Sun he decides to marry into her family. Her family is Yakuza. Sun goes to live with Nagasumi and his family, unfortunately her father and his lackeys tag along to keep an eye on her. This anime is a lot of fun. There are lots of school hijinks, love rivals and sticky situations. There is a lot to like about this story. Lots of random wackiness and tender loving moments. There are a lot of cliches but the story is still different enough to be quite enjoyable. All of the characters are really likable, and the laughs never stop. I recommend My Bride is a Mermaid to anyone who liked Tenchi Muyo or Love Hina. I want to marry a meramaid too, but not one that's a gangster.",1348963200,3,813,4.285714285714286

4898641,5,B005W2BVX6,This anime series comes in a nice boxset with quality cover. The anime itself is 26 episodes long and it is great to have the entire series in 1 boxset. (Good for collections). The anime contains a lot of interesting humor and the rewatchability factor is actually quite high!,1342310400,,276,4.653061224489796

4898644,3,B005W2BVX6,"This is an OK anime. decent animation, nothing special. The storyline sounded interesting, but then they blew it with the over the top silliness. Its a bit hard to watch more than 3 episodes at a time, i would wait for it to go on clearance before you waste your money.",1330387200,,269,4.294117647058823
4898645,5,B005W2BVX6,"My husband and I just finished watching My Bride Is a Mermaid on DVD.  We decided to buy this set after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wallflower-The-Complete-Collection-S-A-V-E/dp/B003NE8B6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wallflower: The Complete Collection S.A.V.E.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hetalia-Axis-Powers-The-Complete-Series/dp/B006MWA906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hetalia: Axis Powers - The Complete Series</a>, both of which had us laughing, and we wanted to keep the laughter going with another funny anime.

Story: 4/5
This is the story of Nagasumi, a high school boy, who nearly drowns during summer vacation but is saved by a mermaid, Sun.  Because he sees her as a mermaid, either he must be killed or Sun must die.  However, both Sun's and Nagasumi's families come to the arrangement that they will get married, and if he's family, no one needs to die.  The series follows Sun and Nagasumi as they go to school and try to keep the mermaid secret, with mermaid yakuza, a mermaid pop star, typical schoolgirl harem around Nagasumi, hilarious fights, satire, and all kinds of funny hijinks.  Don't expect the story to be amazing because mostly, it is just a set-up for funny episodes.  However, it does deliver on the comedy, which is exactly its goal.

I will say, however, that some characters got annoying, and by the 4th disc, I wished they would just go away for an episode or two.  However, I'm sure that this is just a reaction to watching most of the episodes back to back.  You might benefit from watching only a couple episodes a day.

Animation: 5/5
The animation in this series is excellent.  It's modern, colorful, vibrant, no repeated video, etc.  It's hard to find fault with this aspect!

Sound: 5/5
I watched the English dub version with subtitles.  All of the voices were spot-on and not at all annoying.  Additionally, the music fit the series perfectly!  The opening track was fun and set the tone for the show.  The soundtrack didn't miss a beat, using music that fit the particular funny scenes (like Lunar's dad's theme was similar to the Terminator's! haha), and no track was repeated enough to be a bother.

Packaging: 5/5
The packaging of this set is wonderful enough to even meet my standards!  I dislike flimsy cardboard packaging, sets where the discs are stacked on top of each other, and weak disc holders that can fail and leave the discs moving around during shipment.  My Bride is a Mermaid, to its credit, comes in a sturdy plastic case, in which each disc is stored on a separate plastic piece.  Each DVD is held firmly in place.  The plastic case also comes with an animated, removable cardboard outer box.  I kept it because of its graphics.  It does look nice on a shelf.

Warning:
If you are a parent purchasing this for your child or to watch with a child, be fore-warned, this series contains suggestive sexual themes and a small amount of fan-service.  It was enough to make my husband and I eye each other in surprise at certain moments where sex was suggested, characters behaved in a sexual way, etc.  It did not bother us at all as adult viewers, but I know some parents out there are sensitive about what their children are watching.

Overall: 5/5
When compared to some of the anime greats out there, this series doesn't even come close.  However, as a comedy, My Bride is a Mermaid is pretty entertaining!  If you like the harem/comedy genre, I'm almost certain you will like this.  I don't particularly care for harem comedy, and even I enjoyed it.  So if you are looking for a few good laughs and think the concept of mermaid yakuza in the normal world has some comedic potential, by all means, buy My Bride is a Mermaid!",1330128000,23,3806,5.0772946859903385
