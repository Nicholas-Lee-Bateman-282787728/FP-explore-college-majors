8309274,5,B001HNXR68,"This film, directed by Laurent Herbiet, revisits French memories of the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962) through a young soldier's journal. Costa-Gavras (of ""Z"" and ""Missing"" fame) and his wife Michele co-produced and Costa-Gavras co-wrote the screenplay with Jean-Claude Grumberg. The film contributes to a recent surge in Algerian War films after a much-too-long dry period in French cinema. For years, French films depicted the war taking place largely off screen. When will Algerian films like Chronicle of the Smoldering Years (Chronique des annees de braise), winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes in 1975, resurface in a  DVD version? Maybe this film and films like it will lead to a renewed interest in such classic masterpieces as well as formerly censored French films about the war.",1379894400,,799,5.291338582677166
