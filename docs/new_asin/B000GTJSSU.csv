2618186,5,B000GTJSSU,"Great little british movie about ex-con/burgler who after prison stint  tries to rebuild his life by working in a bakery.  It would all be fine if his adult daughter is not married to a loser who owns a lot of money to a local loan shark.  The loan shark is a tough guy with thugs working for him to beat up debtors and lawyers working to cover all of his legal angles.  In spite of bein tough, he has his own weakness and debts to someone else, that no money can buy...

Then, of course there are lawyers.  Sexy female lawyer shark, partner at the law firm who hires a young ex-lover to be her law partner.  She uses her sexual power over him to make him do what she wants him to.  He, one the other hand feels guilty for cheating on his young, unsuspecting wife who just gave birth to thir first child and his pro-bono client who happens to be the (anti)hero of this movie - our ex-con.

There is a police officer with a young boy in provate school, unable to provide enough money for his son's schooling and protection from a local public school bullies.  His partner, sharp young black woman with almost no other friends in a police department is willing to do whatever it takes in order to preserve their partnership and friendship.

So when everyone owes something to someone in this crew of characters, can an ex-con get away with burglery, arson and murder?  See this movie to find out and enjoy it along the way.  I totally loved the music in the film.",1233446400,13,1461,4.327205882352941

8134534,5,B000GTJSSU,"Such a great gem of a comedic movie. The writing is brilliant. All the actors are brilliant in their parts, every one. I thought to list a few of the obvious ones, like Warren Clarke, Martin Freeman, Amanda Abbington, Malcolm Storry but really they're all pitch perfect in this. Right down to the small roles, like Sophie Stokes (played by Jodi Albert.) Jon Jones did the direction. He also directed the 2007 version of Northanger Abbey, a very tough one to get right.",1518912000,,468,4.650602409638554
8134535,4,B000GTJSSU,"My husband and I watched this movie because it was a BBC production and we like most things by BBC. However, because it started out a bit slow, we almost turned it off but decided to give it more time. I'm so glad we did. Once the twists and turns to the plot kicked in, the movie picked up and held our interest. It was very entertaining and we're glad we stuck with it.",1477180800,2,371,4.027027027027027

8134542,5,B000GTJSSU,"After binge watching all sorts of movies here on Amazon, I'm so glad I came across this.
The plot wasn't that complicated, and I love the use of the narrative of several individuals of the movie.  It wasn't confusing for me at all once I got used to it.
Yes, I may be biased because I love Martin Freeman (Watch the first Fargo season!!) but he was a non like-able mess up in this movie.
Everybody wants something, and you can't help but empathize with the characters- understanding why each person did what he/she did.
Give it a try!  It's fun and a hidden gem.",1470182400,,562,4.3428571428571425
