Rod Taylor and Keith Michelle were well paired in this swashbuckling high seas drama. Good viewing, if only for the nostalgia experience.",1428019200,,301,4.921568627450981

8483729,4,B005QROKTO,"""Seven Seas to Calais"" is among the very best of the ""spaghetti swashbucklers"".  Its Italian production and international cast is greatly strengthened by the presence of Australians Rod Taylor as Sir Francis Drake and Keith Michell as Malcolm Marsh, with American Irene Worth as a delightful Queen Elizabeth.

The film opens with a rousing chase through the streets of Plymouth, England, leading to a thrilling sword fight among the skeletons of the ships under construction at the wharf.  Unlike other spaghetti swashbucklers, the pacing doesn't flag too badly, though ""Seven Seas to Calais"" is overlong at 102 minutes.

Still, with its exciting action set pieces, beautiful costumes and period setting, capable leads, sense of humor, and a good (if not great) story, this is confidently recommended for aficionados of swashbucklers and period dramas.

The print by Sinister Cinema is a rather dark, pan-and-scan copy.  Widescreen copies from brighter and cleaner stock are available on DVD, but not from Sinister Cinema, nor MGM (at this time).  As the film was shot in CinemaScope, cropped versions such as this Sinister Cinema edition rob the viewer of almost 2/3rds of the picture and can be very frustrating during action sequences.  It's still better than no movie at all, but a proper widescreen release would be most welcome.

UPDATE (10 August 2014):
Warner Brothers Archive Editions have released a DVD-R with a decent widescreen print of ""Seven Seas to Calais"".  Amazon has it here:
