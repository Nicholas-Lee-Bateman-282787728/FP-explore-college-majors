1392293,1,B0000541W8,"What a waste of time, money and effort making this trash is. Forget that ""you won't like it if you're not a Christian"" claptrap. This movie is so insulting to anyone who cares about parenting, children, the clergy, with no intelligence behind it. I'll give them some high marks for some scary special effects. But how can Kim Basinger have anything to do with this trash.
Having a cult leader demonstrate to a six year old girl how to douse a homeless man with gasoline and set him on fire right in front of us? Yes, that's an important message to get out.
This movie was made in the hopes of sucking up a few more hapless teenagers' movie dollars, and they didn't care for one second how they did it.
Its worse sin? It's sinfully stupid. The dialog is not to be believed. ""Say his name [Satan, we assume]. SAY IT"" yells the villain as a knife is held to the throat of a small child. I think they hired a few small children to do the screenplay, is what.",982108800,3,954,4.276243093922652
1392294,2,B0000541W8,"The main problem with a movie like this -a scary movie I mean- is when it is not scary. Kim Basinger is just bad in this film about a young girl that has a special gift to lead people to God. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason her and real life ex-husband Alec Baldwin split because of her lack of being in good movies(this and ""I Dreamed of Africa""). The young girl featured is good. But the murderer of the film has to be the screen writer chickening out when it finally get really creepy. I mean, Satan shows up, roars and is gone just like that. Why couldn't he eat someone or at least say how hell is doing these days. An okay attempt that falls short compared to others of its kind.",982022400,,691,4.125925925925926
1392295,4,B0000541W8,"Bless the Child is another Good Versus Evil type of movie, but unlike most of them, this one is pretty good.
Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits were great(although Smits' role wasn't a far cry from his character on NYPD Blue).  There is just enough suspense to keep you wondering what was going to happen next.  The special effects, although sparingly used, were well done.
Overall, its an enjoyable movie, and worth checking out.

1392296,5,B0000541W8,This movie was incredible - espeically to those familiar with the Christian Faith.  There was so much symbolism throughout the whole movie that each time you see it you pick up more.

It's undoubtedly Kim Bassingers' worst career choice ever.  Jimmy smits should stick to television shows because their is a  huge difference between the silver screen and the little grey one!  As for the little girl she should watch tapes of Haley Joel Osment if she wants to really know how to be a successful young actr/actrss.

1392298,5,B0000541W8,"While I am disgusted with the critical reception this film was greeted with (as I usually agree with film critics), I can certainly understand why so many people were dismissive about ""Bless the Child."" However, the fault cannot be placed on the film. This is for one very simple reason: ""Bless the Child"", despite its R-rating (for violence and language), is, at heart, a Christian film. And unless one is a Christian, one can rarely enjoy a Christian film. ""Bless the Child"", starring Kim Basinger as a nurse attempting to wrest her kidnapped (and unusually Christ-like) young niece away from a demonic cult masquerading as a self-empowerment group, moved me to tears. It is a one-of-a-kind portrait of the very real spiritual warfare going on all over the world, in our country especially. It joins such films as ""The End of the Affair"", ""Stigmata"", ""Dogma"" and ""Dead Man Walking"" as a contemporary Christian allegory/critique which must dress up its true message with enough audience-grabbers like violence, obscenity and sex/nudity to avoid being labeled as ""Christian."" Were this to happen, the film would not receive big-studio backing and would be restricted to the well-intentioned but wholly mediocre ranks of ""The Omega Code"" and ""Left Behind."" It definitely wouldn't have gotten such upper-B list stars as Basinger, Jimmy Smits (as the cop on the case), Christina Ricci (in an unexpectedly small but crucial role as an escapee from the clutches of the cult), and up-and-comers Rufus Sewell (of ""Dark City"" fame, as the leader of the cult) and Angela Bettis (from ""Girl, Interrupted"", as Basinger's constantly troubled sister and the mother of the kidnapped girl). I will concede that even as a Christian film, ""Bless the Child"" is occasionally over-baked and, when viewed out of its Christian subtext, is basically your typical formulaic pseudo-spiritual Hollywood poop. However, if you are reading this and you are a Christian, I can practically guarantee your enjoyment and appreciation of this truly inspiring film which just happened to be a victim of bad marketing.",979603200,23,2082,5.162721893491124
1392299,1,B0000541W8,"I only saw this film because my girlfriend wanted to and I did try hard to enjoy it but it sucked big time. There are so many plot holes and hard to swallow plot elements.
For example are we really supposed to believe that Kim Basinger is the sister of someone who is about 24 years younger than her? What on earth was that evil nanny supposed to be? What was the point in taking Cody to the dentist? And why did this film build up to such an unsatisfying climax? For a film that tried to draw its power from supernatural hokum the ending was spectacularly ordinary.
The acting was exceptionally poor throughout and I am very surprised that Chuck Russell churned out such a piece of manufactured garbage. If you take equal parts of Rosemary's Baby, Devil's Advocate, End of Days and that awful Winona Ryder film Lost Souls, mix it up with a large dose of badly recorded ADR (99% of the film's dialogue) and you have this film. It might have been better if Christina Ricci had been in it more. I swear, she must have been in it for about 5 minutes absolute max.
I also must mention the absurdly fake SFX that polluted the whole film. What were those flying demons supposed to be anyway? I give this film a big 1/10

After i saw this film, i only thought that ""I Dreamed Of Africa"" was a good film. that is how bad this movie is. it makes bad films look more appealing. This film has the makings of what could have been a better fillm, the first thing being the actors. Here we see Basinger, Christina Ricci, and the great Rufus Sewell (Dark City). Do any of these actors give a performance that i remembered when i walked out of the theater? No, not at all.

1392324,4,B0000541W8,"Bless the Child is a really good horror film.  At first I thought the writing, acting and story was tacky and low budget because the film feels older than 2000, but the storytelling improves in a major way later on.

It stars Kim Basinger as a woman taking in her sisters baby daughter (the sister played by Angela Bettis who looks WAY too young compared to Kim to be a younger sister and more like a daughter, and the daughter is played by Holliston Coleman).  Angela's character is a mess.  She does drugs, has mental issues, she's an emotional wreck and disobeys authority.  She doesn't even know if she did drugs while being pregnant with Holliston.  This prompts Kim to take in the daughter for what she assumes is permanently and work through all the issues Holliston goes through such as banging her head on the wall until 6 years later when Angela and her new boyfriend (Rufus Sewell) arrive and demand that the baby return to them.  Of course Kim declines which results in a few unfortunate instances when Kim finds out what Rufus is all about.

However Rufus... well let's get to the daughter first!  She's a little angel and can miraculously bring birds back from the dead and make them fly again.  Rufus however, is a sadistic monster.  He worships the devil and does the worst thing imaginable- when he and Angela gain control of their daughter, he makes it his personal mission to turn Holliston into a devil worshipping child.  Holliston however is too bright and pure to fall for that nonsense.

Rufus makes some good points about God vs. the devil.  ""I'm real because you can physically touch and see me- God may or may not be real"" says Rufus (more or less not word for word) as he sadistically holds Holliston over the edge of a building top and attempts to lure the little girl over to his dark side.  This is a VERY hard scene to watch because it shows a man basically tormenting a child and threatening to drop her off the top of a building, but the little girl is clever and say ""You first!"" as a response which had me laughing.  Rufus didn't find it funny though.

There's another crazy segment involving Rufus threatening to set a homeless man on fire in his attempt to convince Holliston that being evil is the right path to take, only for Holliston to walk up to the man and place a religious ornament in his hands.  I liked this scene.  Too bad Rufus sets the man on fire as he walks away anyway.  So basically the storyline is all about Rufus trying to turn a sweet little girl into the devil and Kim attempting to stop it but failing time and time again because Rufus has others (such as a cranky old lady and a bald-headed man) who are part of his crazy group of misfits.  Not sure if Rufus worked for the devil or was the devil himself, because he certainly had that evil look in his eye like he could be the actual devil.

A couple more frightening scenes are when Kim sees demonic birds flying around in the subway station or hovering in a circle around a building.  The way these demonic birds fly around is pretty scary stuff.  Not exactly the flying monkeys from the Wizard of Oz but close!  And don't forget about the daughters rat-infested bedroom!  At least that was just a bad dream.  Good to see Jimmy Smits again- he played in all kinds of mystery dramas on TV in the 80's.  Not sure whatever happened to him.

Overall Bless the Child is pretty good.  The storyline is tacky in the beginning and the acting isn't up to par on a few occasions either, but gradually the storytelling improves.  The final 30 minutes is pretty awesome.  Christina Ricci's character feels sort of unnecessary probably because I associate her with more important roles.

1392332,5,B0000541W8,"The film starts out with the busy New York City hospital nurse, Maggie O' Connors visiting her sister Jenna and discovers her trying to abandon her newborn daughter, Cody. Maggie decides to take Cody into her home and take care of her as the daughter she never had. Six years later, Maggie is now six and acts strange at times. Doctors diagnose her as having autism but Maggie refuses to believe it and decides to enroll Cody in a Catholic school, hoping that the environment will bring Cody out of what's causing her to act the way she does. In addition, there are a string of grisly child murders sweeping the city

Meanwhile, Jenna is re-married with a new, mysterious, and creepy husband, Eric Stark, a fairly known man who has written a book and is the founder of an interesting organization called the New Dawn that serves as a rehabilitation center for people with drug and alcohol problems as well as taking in people who have lost their way into a dark place in life and need re-direction. When Jenna learns that doctors have diagnosed Cody with autism, she decides she wants Cody back to have her live with her and Eric, but Maggie is extremely reluctant, believing that she's taking good care of Cody on her own.

One day, Maggie and Cody visit again, where this time, Cody is kidnapped by Eric with the assistance of some assailants. All the while, a series of grisly occult related child murders have swept the city, in which each murdered child shared a common connection of being born on the same day. Maggie enlists the aid of FBI agent, John Travis, who's experienced in occult related crimes in ritual murders. He takes up her case upon realizing that Cody shares the same birthday as many of the other children that were recently killed.

Soon enough, it turns out that Eric is responsible for the child murders and has kidnapped Cody for a special reason. Cody was born with extraordinary holy powers that evil forces have waited centuries to gain control of and sway into their own favor. In the midst of a spiritual war between good and evil, Cody is left with a major ultimatum: join Eric and his congregation and be reborn as a high disciple of the god they love and worship or die for the one she does. Whichever decision Cody makes, will greatly impact the spiritual war of good and evil forever

Overall: I was fortunate enough to catch this on TV one morning, getting ready for work and am glad to say it's become a favorite of mine. The plot of Bless the Child is fresh and original and doesn't try to paint religion in a bad light. Come on, how many times have you watched a religious based horror or thriller film where the God believers/Christians/Catholics were portrayed as the psychos/killers/abusers/villains of the movie? Too many to be frank. Bless the Child doesn't do that. In a film of God and angels vs Satan and demons, the producer portrays the Satan worshipers as evil, while the Catholics are the protagonists. It's a nice and at times emotional film that portrays the war that goes on everyday that most of mankind is not even aware of. The effects for this film are just marvelous. While mostly computer graphics were used for effects, they were really well done for a movie that came out in 2000. There's one scene in particular where rats come together and form a terrifying but striking image of Satan. They couldn't have chosen a better person than Rufus Sewell to play the eerily sinister Eric Stark. I mean the guy just naturally looks like a creep. Like one of those guys whose face you don't want to see when you walk in the dark or close your eyes. Overall, Bless the Child is amazing beginning to end and if you're a fan of religious thriller movies then I highly recommend you put this one in your collection",1434153600,,3767,4.576296296296296

1392368,4,B0000541W8,"Released in 2000, ""Bless the Child"" is a thriller/horror that comes across as an inverted ""The Omen"" (1976) with elements of ""End of Days"" (1999). A little girl with awe-inspiring abilities is raised by her aunt, Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger), because her mother is a drug addict (Angela Bettis). The latter hooks up with a weird cult, led by the arrogant Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), and they want the child for diabolical purposes.

This is no low-budget production as it cost $40 million to make and was directed by Chuck Russell, who's known for a few fairly significant movies, like ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors,"" the remake of ""The Blob"" and 1994's highly successful ""The Mask."" Despite this, ""Bless the Child"" strangely comes across as a Lifetime movie with a higher budget. In other words, it somehow lacks the sheen and pizazz of an expensive production, which explains the film's mediocre ratings.

While I understand this criticism I was able to enter into the world of the characters and enjoy the movie. It's not technically as good as ""The Omen"" (and some would say that it's sacrilege to even compare them), but I personally prefer ""Bless the Child"" simply because I like the story, characters and themes better, despite the film's weaknesses.

Concerning the cast: Kim Basinger was past her physical prime, but she still looks good and she's a likable and compassionate protagonist. Jimmy Smits co-stars as the detective on the case and he's effective, as always. Cutie Christina Ricci shines in a small role as a runaway who tries to help Maggie. They're all good, but it's Rufus Sewell who's most memorable as the leader of a cult that mixes elements of LaVeyian Satanism with Sciencefictionology.

The CGI is a mixed bag, some of the effects are pretty good while some are barely serviceable, but you have to consider the age of the movie. Regardless, special effects are just icing on the cake; it's the story and characters that count and this is where ""Bless the Child"" is solid -- nothing great or exceptionally good, but solid.

The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in Toronto, Burlington and Sarnia, Ontario.

1392379,5,B0000541W8,"""Bless the Child"" is not the easiest movie to classify, which is one of its strengths. It can be categorized as a supernatural thriller or even as a horror film, but it is more than that.  In the story, Jenna has just given birth to an autistic girl named Cody. Jenna abandons Cody, however, leaving her sister Maggie to raise her. After six years, Maggie begins to discover that there is more going on with Cody than autism. Cody is showing signs that she is gifted with amazing powers that could only come from God, including the power to heal dead birds. It seems that Cody is destined for greatness. As you would expect from this kind of movie, however, there are forces who want to use Cody's power for evil. Cody is kidnapped by a cult leader who intends to kill her if he is unable to turn her. Maggie must find the cult leader and rescue Cody before it is too late. There is plenty of action and drama mixed in with the thrills and scares, including chase scenes, an exploding car, and an extremely chilling scene of a young boy being lured into a kidnapping. There are some very moving moments as well, including one in which Cody tells a homeless man that God has not forgotten him. Overall, this is a fantastic movie. Compared with others that focus on the traditional theme of ""good versus evil,"" this is definitely one of the better ones.",1382659200,,1351,4.44758064516129

If you are looking for an action film with a religious theme then this is a good one.  Not as inspiring as some, but a nice story and as believable as you want to let it be.  The overall plot is a little far fetched if you are talking strictly biblical, but as a movie it is good.

1392406,3,B0000541W8,"This is a fun movie about a special child, in appearance autistic but in fact gifted in uniquely special ways.  Her aunt, Kim Bassinger, accepts responsibility for her and, only later, encounters a secretive organization that wants to control the child for its own ends.  With a good cop, Smits, she rises to the occasion, in the process reexamining her life and faith.

The strongest point of the film is the acting.  Bassinger is not a sex symbol, but a normal woman who is desperate to save a loved one.  Her sister is movingly portrayed as a troubled addict, while the evil protagonist is truly frightening.  Smits is also excellent as a priest turned cop, having found ""another way to serve him.""  The chemistry of these characters works extremely well.  The child is also eminently believable.

In addition, though dated the special effects are quite evocative, esp. at the end.  I don't want to give away the plot:  suffice it to say that even though I am a non-believer, I was moved, at times terrified, always interested.  The atmospherics of the film are especially powerful.

On the weaker side, the plot was a bit far-fetched, full of chance encounters and desperate moves that didn't quite ring true to me.

1392418,4,B0000541W8,"I've always liked stories about the battle of good vs. evil-even liked the Exorcist,when I thought I wouldn't. The Christian based movies by Cloud Ten pictures-Left Behind films and Apocolypse films, I liked them for awhile, until I realized they pushed the message too hard.
Now on with the review. Stephen King's movies, imo, know exactly how to depict evil charecters, it's pretty rare that I see one I don't like. Kim Basinger, is definately the good guy here, as is most of the cast, except Rufus Sewell from Dark City, the obvious villian, very convincing as well. Soft spoken, weird eyes, and very creepy. Jimmy Smits did a nice job as the cult investigator. The special f/x were pretty good, coming from me that's not saying much, I initially said the same about End of Days, liked that movie too. Now, if you're a Christian, you may not like this film, because it is very violent, and somewhat graphic. That didn't bother me, but one thing does-trying to make the Devil look more powerful than God.
One certain critic infuriated me when they said KB is so clumsy you'll be rooting for the cult group. But if you haven't seen it and are religious by any spectrum, you may be impressed, if nothing else-try it because of Holliston Coleman who plays Cody, for a young girl, she was incredible.",1306022400,4,1299,4.6521739130434785
1392419,4,B0000541W8,"One of my favorite movies of all-time is ""The Omen"". That is my yard stick for horror movies in general and supernatural thrillers in particular. This movie holds-up well in the comparison. ""Bless the Child"" does not have any truly nail-biting moments like the scene from ""The Omen"" in the Italian graveyard but it does come close with the scene in the beginning showing a child being abducted, Christina Ricci in the subway, and the final scene.

I also had a great affinity for some of the biblical and apochryphal stories that were woven into this movie: the scene with the bird is similar to a story in one of the Gnostic Gospels, the retelling of the ""Slaughter of the Innocents"", and the temptation at the top of the building.

One thing that needs addressed is the relationship to the book, which is tenuous at best. The movie is an extremely stripped-down retelling. The novel weaves many different religious systems and mythologies together and contains significantly more material than that shown in the movie. Heck, other than the names of the characters, I think this is probably the furthest I've seen a movie stray from its source novel....OK, maybe throw in Baldacci's ""Absolute Power"" in there, too.

Aside from the comparison to the novel, this movie as a stand-alone project was one of the better supernatural/religious thrillers I've seen. The story wasn't overshadowed by special effects nor was it bogged down by an array of sub-plots and other extraneous material as I've experienced in other similar movies.

I thought the actor playing Eric Stark was perfect for the part. Just enough arrogance interlaced with charm to nail that character perfectly. The girl playing Cody, the central character, was tremendous, especially considering she was only six or seven years old...so, I have to give a lot of credit to the director for that performance, too.

The other enjoyable performance was Jimmy Smits. His character was an FBI agent who had spent some time in Seminary. He walked a fine line of having his character stay true to his religious beliefs, especially in a very secular workplace, without coming off a 'preachy' or 'moralistic'. That was a refreshing change from other movies in this genre.

All in all, ""Bless the Child"" is one of the better movies I've seen in this genre...not a full-blown horror movie but a highly entertaining, fun way to spend 90 minutes or so. This is one to watch more than once.",1278460800,3,2439,4.879227053140097

Cody quickly touches Maggie's heart and becomes the daughter she has always longed for. But six years later Jenna suddenly re-enters her life and, with her mysterious new husband, Eric Stark, abducts Cody. The little girl, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply ""special."" She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.

1392425,5,B0000541W8,"Perhaps because this low-key thriller had a message of faith in the Good vs. Evil battle in our time it did not fare as well at the box office as darker films of this ilk, but is in fact, both exciting and involving. Kim Basinger gives a fine performance in director Chuck Russell's underrated film.

Christmas is a week away and the appearance of a star which has not been observed since the birth of Christ coincides with a series of ritual child murders. Maggie O'Conner (Kim Bassinger) is a nurse living alone after being deserted by a husband who split following two miscarriages. Her sister Jenna (Angela Bettis), a drug addict, shows up on her doorstep only long enough to leave her newborn baby, Cody. Maggie raises her as her own, becoming mother to the somewhat withdrawn little red-haired girl. Maggie senses something is different about Cody, not accepting the diagnoses of autism given her by doctors, and is right. Cody has gentle powers and has been born to lead people back to God.

John Travis (Jimmy Smits) is the Federal Agent whose time as a seminary student comes in handy leading the investigation into the six year old children being killed because they were born on December 16th, an occult symbol carved into their arms which points to Black Easter. Rufus Sewell of Dark City and television's 11th Hour is Erik Stark, a charismatic guru who knows what Cody is, and must turn her or destroy her. Holliston Coleman is excellent as the very sweet Cody, whose powers, such as lighting all the candles in church through thought and healing injured animals through her touch is witnessed by Sister Rosa (Lumi Cavazos). When Cody is kidnapped by Stark, Maggie and Agent Travis are helped by angels directing them to her.

Christina Ricci gives a fine performance as Sherry Post, who is being sought out by Stark's followers as well. She tries to help Maggie find Cody before it is to late, highlighted by a tense chase in a subway with a shocking ending. As Maggie gets her back and then loses her again amidst images of winged darkness and Stark's minions, Sister Rosa and Reverend Grissom (Ian Holm), a scholar censured by the Vatican, aid her in her desperate search to save her daughter's life and soul.

This is all handled in a low key and effective manner of ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances, which adds to the suspense. There is an underlying message about faith in God scattered throughout this teriffic film perhaps different than what many came to it expecting to see. The old-fashioned notion that good will always, in the end, will out and conquer evil leaves viewers of that mindset heartened by its message. Those looking for a film in this genre with a more hopeful ending and substantive message may find this as good as I did when I first saw it in a theatre. An excellent suspense film with supernatural overtones, and an ending for those who still believe there is hope.",1253404800,4,2931,4.729941291585127

I purchased this movie in a Wal-Mart ""$5.50 Bin"" expecting nothing more than a few cheap thrills and something to watch while enjoying a bowl of popcorn.
It was much more than that. I will not go into details, you can read those in the Amazon review. What I will say, though, is that Kim Basinger did a fantastic job of acting in this one. Her character exuded warmth and strength simultaneously. I actually cared for her character and wanted the good to overcome with tremendous conviction. The story had depth and a somewhat believable premise, if not convoluted slightly (but not too much to take away from the edge-of-your-seat thrills).

You see this especially in the last scene of the movie, but it is also depicted in other parts as well. It is a ""horror movie with heart"".",1163376000,2,380,4.291666666666667
1392434,3,B0000541W8,"It takes a brave person to willingly view a film with a 95% ""rotten"" rating on the ""Tomatometer"" but when the cast includes Angela Bettis, Christina Ricci, and Ian Holm you begin to get interested. Then when the same critics are overwhelmingly praising an exercise in excess like the new ""King Kong"", you begin to wonder if their judgment can be trusted about a film like ""Bless the Child"". Not that ""Bless the Child"" is a small independent film, it had a $40 Million budget although there is little sign much of that money actually made it onto the screen; except that the DVD has far more extensive special features than some low-budget production.

Anyway, if you are curious enough to view ""Bless the Child"" and if your expectations are modest, you should find it a pleasant surprise. Not because of Ricci (who has only two scenes although both are done well). Or because of Holm (who makes an extremely short appearance of little consequence). And not because of Bettis, although she gets a fair amount of screen time and has one especially good scene at the start of the film. And not because of top billed Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits, who give competent if unexceptional performances.

The real star is young Holliston Coleman (best known as the ""Me"" in the television movie ""Miss Lettie and Me"") as six year old Cody. Director Chuck Russell (The Mask,"" ""Eraser"") gets a restrained but glowing performance from Coleman as a six-year-old savior sent by God to restore mankind's faith. At the start of the film, a strung-out Bettis brings then 9-day old Cody for a long over-due visit with older sister Maggie, a NYC psychological nurse. Once Maggie starts fussing with the baby, Bettis sneaks out, leaving Cody behind to be raised by Maggie.

At first it is thought that Cody is autistic but when she starts resurrecting dead birds and performing small scale miracles her Aunt Maggie (Basinger) begins to realize that she is something else. Without the right actress and the right level of performance this whole idea would be truly awful, but Coleman deftly alternates between playful and serious, giving the character a believability that has to be seen to (dare we say it) be believed.

The suspense is provided by a self-empowerment guru named Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), who is actually an agent of the devil and intends to kill Cody if he cannot turn her to the dark side. Stark first appears about midway into the film, which begins to go steadily downhill from that point.

There are a couple of good thrills (including a bedroom full of rats), one great scare (the nanny's face changes suddenly and unexpectedly into that of a demon), and some lame special effects stuff that doesn't work well (Maggie's drive against the flow of traffic). In a cool and perversely funny scene Maggie threatens Eric with a gun and he says, ""Are you really going to shoot me? Right here in front of Cody?"" Maggie simply tells Cody to close her eyes.",1134864000,8,2946,4.74609375
1392435,3,B0000541W8,"I love movies with religious tones to them, despite not being any which way religious myself. Stigmata and End Of Days, and now this, are excellent examples, although Constantine overdoes it slightly. The trailer gets it totally wrong, and makes it look more like an Exorcist movie, than what it eventually ends up being. Don't think it's going to be an Exorcist movie, it's so much deeper, and I ended up working out what was going to happen quite soon into the movie. So unlike me.

The actors in this also do an excellent job. Everyone raves about gorgeous Kim Basinger is, but they forget she can do plain & ordinary just as well, and pulls it off. Rufus Sewell was perfect for the cult leader he played (with shades of Scientology?), and with those eyes, god I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares after watching this movie! The slight lazy eye makes him stand out from everyone else. Jimmy Smits, wow! For an older guy, he's definitely kept in shape, and looks good! I wasn't sure about Angela Bettis' character. She played it well, don't get me wrong, but from the roles I've seen her in (only this & Girl Interrupted), it's almost like she plays the anorexic, drug-addict very well. Probably cos she's ultra skinny, and needs a good feeding. Christina Ricci should have been in this movie more, as she's an excellent actress, but she's only a couple of scenes, and then gets killed - real or not?! Funky scene though, you'll jump out of your seat at this bit.

The bridge where the car ""accident"" takes place is actually the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan. It was being ""twinned"" at the time so the whole bridge was closed down for repairs and was available for numerous re-takes. The scenery shots of NYC were then placed in the background, although people who grew up there recognize the shores as being Sarnia and Pt. Huron, respectively, not NYC.

The subway station where the attack on Meg takes place is a ""ghost"" station on the Toronto subway that is used frequently as a stand in for New York subways. The city's film office wanted to leave it set up as a NYC station but the Toronto fire department nixed that idea. The station is below the Bay station on the Bloor line, on the track connecting the Bloor and Yonge lines. At one time trains went from one line to the other - thus the station - but the practice was discontinued because of switching problems. (There is also a ""ghost"" station beneath the Queen Street station. It was roughed in 1954 for a planned Queen Street subway which never was built.)

In the original script, a character is deliberately pushed off a subway platform. This had to be changed to an accidental fall before the Toronto Transit Commission would allow filming on its property.

When the candles in the cathedral ignite together, the camera pulls back and Maggie's shirt can be seen blowing, as if the candles were in fact being blown out, and film was run backwards.

The line ""the devils greatest trick was convincing man that he didn't exist"" is a reference to a similar line in another movie of the same Genre, End of Days (1999). In which Father Kovak (Rod Steiger) says: ""Satan's greatest trick was convincing man that he didn't exist."". And also to The Usual Suspects (1995) where the line ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing man that he didn't exist."" shows up.

This is also based on a book, which looks good, and I managed to find it in a bookcase in our house soon after getting the DVD, so I might give that a try soon.

I wouldn't believe the bad reviews that you read about this, at least if you think it looks interesting, give it a chance. I enjoyed it, and glad I got it now. Pick it up cheap though.",1111622400,16,3724,4.54776119402985
1392436,4,B0000541W8,"A little girl named ""Cody"" supposedly representing the ""light side"" is born, whom which is heralded by a bright star shining in the heavens like the nazarene fable. A cult-leader takes on the role of Herod in attempting to capture this special child, labelled herein as ""The Slaughter of Innocence"", in the process, murdering children born in the same week, much like that presented in Omen 3, which displayed the same dynamic. At first, she is misdiagnosed with autism, for being so introverted, but steadily begins demonstrating supernatural abilities, particularly in the telekinetic vein, which catches the attention of one of the cult leader's lackeys; the cult-leader charms his way into the life of the single, drug-addicted, thieving & emaciated mother named 'Jenna', who dumped the child with her older sister Maggie O'Connor {played by Kim Basinger}, who takes the child as her own, until the lowlife 'mother' returns with the Cult-leader to kidnap the child, in order to brainwash her towards the 'Dark Side', or to sacrifice her if she does not turn to darkness. The cult is more reminiscent of Scientology in its aesthetics & iconography, rather than some satanistic cult, although the adolescent thugs match the gothic/devil-worshipper criteria. Which in one notable scene, beat the hell out of Christina Ricci's character {a little goth-(...)}, eventually decapitating her in a subway, through the behest of demonic enitites circumnavigating the area as she is beaten into a bloody pulp. . A nice effect.

 The demonic manifestations witnessed by Basinger's character at various spots are remarkable, given marvellous life. The whole story, after she is chased down by the cult to retrieve the girl whose attempted re-kidnapping in a poignant scene lands her in her car travelling in the opposite direction on a bridge highway, at which she crashes into the edge, the car teetering on the verge of plunging into the rushing river, but she is rescued by a burley angel who dematerializes - that is one thing that is noticed now & again, these ""angels"" appearing here & there to help her & the girl along in various places, rescuing them out of some tough spots, where they would have otherwise surely perished. As the angels appear, so do the demons manifest themselves in the various ""humans"" surrounding the cult-leader, whose henchmen speed around in a black limousine {reminiscient of Mike Warnke's fictional ""The Satan Seller""}.

 Jimi Smits plays an occult investigator {a-la Randy Emon}, who is pictured briefly leafing through The Devil's Notebook among his collection of occult books, although the camera does not once close-up on it, but instead shows the back from a distance - but does display a ""photo"" {looks photoshopped} on one fabricated collage of Dr. LaVey in horned cowl.

The materialization of Satan in a converted church {surrounded with flying, graceful serpantine black demons} is splendid {recollections of The Devil's Rain comes to mind}, transmogrifying from a legion of rats {likened in the Francis Ford Coppola version of Dracula} onto an infernal throne behind the altar, upon which the little girl awaits to be sacrificed, or to rule the world, depending upon her decision. She is prepared in a bridal gown, brought forth by two black robed cultists. Well, she decides for the blindlight, & is ""delivered"", as it were, by etherial angels who distract the cult-leader, who is then shot by Smits.
The movie does play in the typical binary scenario of good vs. evil, so of course there is the demoralization, but The Devil is not confronted directly, but only makes a brief cameo appearance as described above.

The villain {played by Rufus Sewell} & his organization described in this movie are in the newage description, complete with an insignia which resembles the pyramidical O.T.O.'s, with the caption ""You Are Your Own God"" {so at least there is a minimal portrayal of Satanic philosophy}; although the ideology presented herein is more akin to a bug-eyed satanified Jim Jones.

 Included in this DVD are interviews with director Chuck Russell, as well as with the actors, & allows to jump to various scenes throughout the film. And the cover portrays a striking inverted cross comprised of flames. The film is not Satanic per se, but can be entertaining with the suspension of disbelief.",1105920000,,4338,5.091420534458509

1.) Instead of barely escaping evil (and having the snot beat out of you in the process), Good clearly kicks evil but and triumphs (a frightening/feel good movie).
and
2.) The makers of this movie have clearly interviewed people who have ""seen things"" and tried with more than some success to show evil that way on the screen.  (With that said, some sceens do lose a little on the small screen vs. the theatre.)

Casting was very well done for this movie - choices for evil cult leader, loving mother (aunt actually), and street trash cult member were excellent.

That being said, it is a great film. It is pretty obvious which  cult the film ""cult"" is supposed to be a parody of, and the film makers avoid enough similarities to avoid a law suit. Anyway, aside from that, its a great mix of made up supernatural elements, and action, and some superb acting. And Basinger is great, both visually and in the acting.

1392451,5,B0000541W8,"Along with those here, who have given favorable reviews to ""Bless The Child"", I totally agree.
 It's easy to be critical of the content of this movie by the crirically minded, but take a second look if you will.
 Here are actors portraying a story, of good versus evil. It's done with an honest moral story, of two brave people, working with the odds against them.
  It's my understanding, that when Kim Bassinger was offered this movie, she turned it down with a comment she did not want to do a movie showing children being exploited. But when she was asked just to read the script only, she changed her mind with a great conviction that it was an outstanding story theme.

  You don't have to be religious to see the basic struggle of this movie, and the rescue of a child, with all the  people portrayed  helping out as best they can to save the little girl, the nun's, a cop, a nurse aunt, and the use of prayer to cover the two people involved saving this child. And prayer was a key to the victory in this story.
  It would be great to have more individuals like this we see portrayed in the movie in our country today, from all walks of life, not afraid to to take on evil and injustice around us, in all forms. Apathy only lets evil win, and the people in this movie were determined to fight it, at any risk to themselves.",1075507200,8,1331,4.284

1392455,5,B0000541W8,"Bless The Child is a theatrical tribute to the current world's situations plagued by an intoxicating need for quick solutions to problems no matter what the cost.  The film shows how some will give up their lives, and their souls, in order to fulfill their needs instead of conquering their battles themselves.
The movie starts with a single and middle-aged Maggie (played by Kim Basinger) meeting her long-lost-sister, Jenna (Angela Bettis) ,who brings, and leaves her newborn to her Brooklyn apartment for her to take care of.  Persistent in finding out what is wrong with the child, and disagreeing with the doctor's diagnoses of autism, Maggie places the child, Cody (Holliston Coleman), in a Catholic school where she hopes she will come out of whatever is causing her problems.
A case of murdered children in the area brings federal agent and former seminary student John Travis (Jimmy Smits) to Brooklyn to help the police investigate the murders.  With a specialization in occult mysticism, Travis informs the police that they are not dealing with a comic-book psycho, and the crimes are meant to attack God, not man.
Maggie is greeted by her sister once again, six years after her startling departure.  She is occupied with her new husband, Erick Stark (Refus Sewell), founder of the New Dawn which provides the city with a rehabilitation center for those who abuse drugs or alcohol.  Of course the New Dawn also welcomes those who are confused about who they are, and need some stationary brainwashing.  Insisting she is well enough to take care of her child, Maggie is caught off guard with the request of Stark to take Cody with them to their home, promising she would receive the best medical attention under the most prestige's doctors.  When Maggie declines their request, she learns Cody has been kidnapped.
Maggie quickly goes to the police station and explains what has happened but insisting it is a social worker's custody issue, she is blown off.  Detective Travis ushers her back to his office and explains that he has had an eye on Stark for some time, but protected by the best lawyers-he is legally well-protected.  Frustrated, Maggie leaves the office and ventures into Stark's New Dawn building to solve her problem herself.  Littered by ""There is no God, but you"" pamphlets, Maggie acts interested so she may e-mail Stark directly on one of the message boards, requesting another conference with him.
Experiencing some exhaustion from the current circumstances, Maggie walks into one of the rooms at the hospital where she is a practiced nurse.  Here she meets Sherry Post (Christina Ricci) who explains her friends shot her up and left her to die.  While having a conversation, Sherry accidentally blurts out that Maggie looks like her sister, revealing she knows who they are.  Being summoned by a doctor to assist him in another room, Maggie has to run out after Sherry tells her ""Don't let them get the girl.  You know she's special, don't you?""
When Maggie arrives back at her apartment, there is a message for her from Sherry telling her to meet her at a diner.  Upon arrival, Maggie hands Sherry some cash for a bus fare out of the city.  It is here that Sherry explains to Maggie Cody will lead people to God, and Stark will do whatever it takes to stop that.  Spotting some of Erik's minions outside the diner, Sherry slams a gun on the table wrapped in a small piece of paper which includes the address of Stark's home, and runs away.  Maggie chases her into a metro station where she is knocked out by one of the goons, and left for dead on the tracks while it is far too late for an oncoming train to stop.
Fit-up, Maggie goes to Stark's home where she tries to take Cody back with her, but is drugged by one of Stark's accomplices and placed in a car on the wrong side of the road on top of a bridge. Swerving to avoid cars, Maggie hits the side and forces the car to titter-totter off the side.
Finding help from a nun and a reverend that have experience helping people out of Stark's occult, Maggie ventures into the dentist office where Cody is having her teeth cleaned.  Sneaking in and out, Maggie grabs Cody and runs out into the street.  Chased by the dentist, minions, and the nanny, Maggie takes Cody into a nearby metro station and runs to a train just as the door is shutting.  A shy woman with an umbrella calmly places it between the closing doors, opening it, and allowing them to escape on the train just before the nanny runs to the train and bangs on the side-revealing her demonic form to Cody and Maggie.
Upon the reverend's advice, Maggie takes Cody north to a church in upstate New York where she will be safe.  Noting Maggie's tardiness, the nuns begin to pray for the safety and well-being of Maggie and Cody.  Cody is once again kidnapped, and Maggie once again chases after her, resulting in herself being held against her will in an abandoned church.  Finally being able to see one of Stark's ceremonies first-hand, Maggie notes the flying dragons and thousands upon thousands of rats which form a brief, but graphic Lucifer.
This dramatic and heart pounding adventure brings people of all backgrounds under the realization that ""there is a spiritual battle happening every second of everyday.  All of our actions influence the outcome of this battle.""",1055548800,17,5319,4.736728060671723
1392456,3,B0000541W8,"I saw this movie at the cinema, having previously read the book. As with most movies adapted from a novel, the movie barely barely scratched the surface of the real story.
Unless you're able to sit back and watch it with an open mind, you'd end up comparing every little (and not so little) thing. You could spend hours doing this. For example, in the movie, Ghania was portrayed simply as a rather nasty looking Nanny figure (who admittedly was later revealed to be demonic) and was white, whereas in the book she was black, and an evil witch of phenomenal power. The prime nasty in the movie is Eric Stark (played nicely by Rufus Sewell); in the book he is Eric Vannier. There is also a relationship of sorts between Eric and Ghania that never made it onto the screen - probably for a very good reason. Jenna is rescued in the movie, and gives her sister Maggie full custody of Cody. In the book, Jenna is actually Maggie's daughter, and far from being saved, she ends up being ritually sacrificed by her 'loving husband' Eric, and is damned to Hell for eternity. And the final spectacular confrontation that results in Eric's death, the temporary demonic possession of Cody, and her ultimate rescue by Maggie (Grandmothers rock!) is reduced to a 'Showdown at High Noon' style finish.
The movie also fails to include many crucial characters that played a vital role in rescuing Cody.
I probably sound like I'm being overly critical, but read the book and you'll know where I'm coming from. Don't get me wrong - I definitely enjoyed the movie. It really wasn't anyone's fault that it came up a bit short. To fit everything in is an impossibility. To try and do that, they would have ended up with a mini-series, rather than a 2 hour film.
In all honesty the only thing that really disappointed me, I suppose, were the restrictions they had to place on Cody's true nature.
And in response to another previewer, no. Cody was never supposed to be autistic. This was a misdiagnosis on the part of doctors who could not comprehend any other reason for her behaviour.
In the movie, Cody is simply represented as a new prophet of God, someone who is almost messianic in their current incarnation. In the book, Cody is the Isis Messenger, a promised saviour from the Goddess Isis as far back as very ancient Egypt. The Cody character from the book encompasses not only Christianity, but every other religion that focuses on good rather than evil. Likewise, the nasties in the book encompass all aspects of evil, from multiple religions and sects.
All in all, the adaption was a very reasonable one. It's just hard to be completely open-minded when the book was so fantastic.
I would recommend this movie. There are some real gems of moments to be found in it - particularly the mental and emotional duels that take place between Eric and Cody. Both times, Cody wins out spiritually, much to Eric's fury.
There are some fine performances from Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell, and Jimmy Smits as the priest-in-training-turned-cop who is an expert in the occult. Christina Ricci has a brief but notable role as the addict friend of Jenna who tries to escape the cult, and in the process warn Maggie of the real danger that Cody is in. The child actor who plays Cody also puts in a great performance as the little girl who is far more than she appears.
The movie lacks a little in substance, but that is more a time constraint problem than the fault of the director or the actors. They do a damned fine job with the material they have to work with. This is a movie worth having, but get the book as well.
Even if you aren't that much of a reader, this one is worth it.",1042416000,2,3652,4.560121765601218
1392457,3,B0000541W8,"The battle between good and evil? We've seen it, but never quite at this intensity. A six-year-old autistic heavenly messenger? I doubted I would stay awake long enough to write the review. I couldn't have been more wrong. The effects were impressive, if not eyebrow-raising. The script was written passably well. Kim Basinger (Academy Award winner, 'L.A. Confidential'), cast as Maggie, remains expressionless and monotone (can Oscars be revoked?). Rufus Sewell ('Illuminata') is charmingly diabolical and manipulative as the standard ""bad guy"", playing it to the maximum height possible. Every mother in the audience readies to throttle him for tormenting little Cody, but we soon learn she can take care of herself. Indeed, tiny up-and-comer Holliston Coleman ('Supreme Sanction') is the shining star in this. Coleman, with soulful, intelligent eyes and a sweet smile wins the audience immedietely, bringing an intensity to the role that I've never seen in a seven-year-old or a thirty-seven-year-old. An old-soul appeal makes her perfectly believable, and her tears are not contrived but heartwrenching. This girl is one to watch. Angela Bettis ('Girl, Interrupted') is convincingly confused and desperate as Maggie's daughter/sister (differs between the book and film) Jenna, Cody's drug-addicted mother. Christina Ricci ('Casper') gives the best performance I've seen from her. Her usually-flat voice finds some expression here, although her eyes remain vacant.
A brief note to the writers: research autism before you write about it next time.  Or perhaps Cody was never truly meant to be autistic?
The idea of the battles of extremes isn't so much what drives the film as the child herself. Cody and Maggie's relationship is what, in the end, rekindles some of our faith in the goodness of people.",1031529600,2,1804,5.397163120567376

1392461,2,B0000541W8,"Kim Bassinger did an interview in which she said the took the lead role in Bless the Child because it told a good story. Like many of the works of Stephen King, Bless the Child shows that some stories that read well don't necessarily film well.
Around Christmas Eve, Maggie O'Connor [Bassinger] gets a surprise visit from her drug addicted younger sister, Jenna [Angela Bettis], who brings with her a daughter who's only a few days old. Within minutes Jenna has fled, leaving baby Cody in Maggie's care. A few years later Jenna still hasn't surfaced, and Maggie is raising the child alone. Cody has been diagnosed with autism, but Maggie, who is herself a nurse, doesn't necessarily agree with the doctors. While Cody is withdrawn, she is responsive and loving. Jenna reappears one day with her new husband, Eric [Rufus Sewell]. They demand that Cody be turned over to them at once. Eric heads a vast and mysterious New Age cult, and Jenna claims to be drug free. Maggie refuses to give up custody. You guessed it. Eric is literally in league with the devil, and what follows is a fight for Cody's soul. It seems the child has been chosen as the prize in yet another earthly battle between God and Satan.
The movie is one of dozens that have been spawned over the years as the result of the successes of The Exorcist and The Omen. The themes of Bless the Child are not as dark, in that the ideas of free will and the power of good are emphasized. It is the tired old tools of the horror genre that bring it down. Once again, the Catholic church is used as the only religious power on earth that can recognize evil forces and that has the tools to battle them. Yet, as always, the people the church employs to fight evil come across as lunatics and fruitcakes. No wonder we are doomed to defeat. Who could be expected to trust, much less believe in, these crazies? Why does cinema Satan always use the same old tricks? Can't anyone think of some new ones?
Kim Bassinger gives a decent performance as Maggie. Eight-year old Holliston Coleman is acceptably creepy as Cody, although she doesn't have much to do other than appearing to be in trance all the time. Both actress are upstaged by Angela Bettis and Rufus Sewell who remind us that playing the bad guys can be the best roles there are, especially in mediocre movies.",1016323200,,2321,4.5285714285714285

This movie was suprisingly uplifting, maybe that's why some don't like it, it's not 'The Omen' in fact it's the complete opposite and that's what I loved about it and found very encouraging.  This day and age everyone wants to blame God for all the bad in the world and this movie shows that it's not God but Satan that underminds the weak minded.  Again, probably another reason why some don't like this movie.  I'm suprised Kim Basinger agreed to play this role.  I'm under the impression that she's a huge, NONE beleiveing in God, liberal.  As the movie says, 'Satan's best work was getting people to beleive there is no God, or Satan, at all.'  This is true in real life too.  There's so many people who only beleive in themselves and only what they can see.  ALSO: The Theory of EVOLUTION, Satans best work indeed.  Have you been dooped?

1392464,3,B0000541W8,"No matter how bad you may find ""Bless the Child,"" do not think it is worthless.  It is produced by Mace Neufeld, who also produced ""Omen"" 25 years ago, so if you like the latter, you may take a look at ""Bless the Child.""
The problem is this; ""Bless the Child"" looks as if it wants to satisfiy the audience at the sacrifice of coherence and probability.  Subtlity is thrown out of the script, even if there was such a thing in the first draft.  Interesting thing is, the film succeeds to a certain degree by that method; but the success also means it killed its delicate side, which tries to depict the fight between the good and the evil.
For example, Kim Basinger provides fairly good performance as a protector of a little girl who is wanted by a cult group.  Her co-stars are also good, including Jimmy Smits, Rufus Sewell, Angela Bettis (""Girl Interrupted,"" ""Sparrow""), all doing great job.  On top of that, there is Christina Ricci.  But, good as their actings are, they are not so memorable as they should be after all.
The reason lies in the way the film is directed.  As soon as emotional tension between the actors is created to inspire the familiar story, the director, discarding the inspiration, goes to CGI extravaganza next, to destroy the atomosphere delicately staged by actors.  So, after you see Basinger playing the mother's role pretty impressively (touching), you see lots of rats swarming in a room (Uhh!).  Or, after we see Angela Bettis showing a skillful acting as a distracted drug addict and cult member, we see ... eh, a car crashing on a bridge, or a policeman hit by a car (yes, car again).  It is like riding a roller-roaster, and sometimes creepy, to be sure, but the thrill gets thinner as he film goes on.  Like ""The Exocist,"" the film portrays the ultimate battle between the good and the evil, but fails to capture the sinister atomosphere of the masterpiece.
So, let's face it.  This is not a horror movie; it's more like a horror action movie, and you should make a new category for ""Bless the Child.""  I enjoyed watching it, but I really doubt the actors are happy to see their efforts turned into a concocted chain of instant excitement.  My conclusion: if you  define good horror movies by a refined script with good acting, avoid it.  If you're not, it's an OK film.",1010534400,,2308,4.565533980582524
1392465,3,B0000541W8,"Bless The Child portrays the prototypical story of Good vs Evil effectively....to a point. The acting is hit & miss for the most part. Rufus Sewell portrays the role of a cult-leader nicely without going over the top. Jimmy Smits doesnt seem too inspired in this film, but nevertheless gives an okay performance. Holliston Coleman, the girl who plays Cody, does an excellent job in her role. Kim Basinger comes off bland throughout most of the movie, and the role Christina Ricci plays shouldve been extended to more than just two short scenes. The plot has obvious major holes that drag the movie down if you sit & disect them. And some scenes are ridiculously laughable / over-the-top. For example, a bird flys head-first into a Catholic-school window as Cody looks on. Next thing you know, all of the children are outside gathering around Cody as she holds it, while the nuns and Cody's aunt (Basinger) watch and laugh whole-heartedly, not caring about the health issues that could arise from a 6 year old girl holding a seemingly dead bird she picked up off the ground. Little things..Characters always being in the right place at the right time. Smits' character always finding clues and evidence that the dozens of cops at the scene seem to always overlook. Basinger not handing over key evidence that could save the child 30 minutes into the film, instead opting for the role of superhero and trying to infiltrate the premesis of a cult all by her lonesome. These along with other noticeable things bring down the film a few notches. However, the film is entertaining. If you sit and watch it just for the entertainment value and not for realism or disecting the plot, you should enjoy this movie. Its a solid story of good ultimately triumphing over evil, with a few thrilling moments along the way.",1003190400,,1807,4.776357827476039

1392467,3,B0000541W8,"Unlike most movies in the religous horror genre, Bless the Child manages to get the theological aspect pretty right, (even though a vision of a child as antichrist or, as in this film, a new savior, have no basis beyond ""The Omen""). It seems to take that aspect seriously, and so much the better.
There is a good story here, well told for the most part. Things generally remains subdued yet manages to create some creepy moments. The cast is strong. Kim Basinger seems to have a great connection with Holliston Coleman, who plays little Cody. Rufus Sewell makes a smart and compelling villian. And Jimmy Smits makes a good showing here to. The visual side of Bless the Child is workman like, but certainly thoughtful and professional. And the effects, though obvious, are certainly effective.
Despite these good marks, there are quite a few questionable ones. Just as the acting is good, it's also uninspired. There doesn't seem to be a high level of passion among anyone involved. And there are quite a few side characters, namely Christina Ricci, who are meakly realized. Some of the horror elements divert from the films tone as well. I'm always up for some gore, but it needs to be well utilized. There are some scenes here that seem outright goofy in relation to the rest of the movie, if not just a little illogical. The end is also something of a let down. It's not bad but it does seem a little shallow. I just felt there should have been a little something more.
Still, I must recommend Bless the Child. Though there are faults, director Chuck Russell obviously took this film very seriously. It's a tale told with care. That always shows.

1392468,4,B0000541W8,"I'm not sure why a lot of people gave this movie poor reviews.  It was a very well done movie with plenty of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Unlike a lot of supernatural thrillers (i.e. ""End of Days""), ""Bless the Child"" requires less suspension of disbelief.  Rather than humans in direct conflict with demons (how is it that humans always seem to be able to blow up or shoot demons, anyway?), humans are in conflict with other humans -- sometimes getting a glimpse into the supernatural realm and seeing the angels and demons at work behind the scenes.
I'm not one who really gets into supernatural thrillers, but this movie was really good.  Unlike a lot of supernatural thrillers, this movie didn't seem to twist common religious beliefs to make a great film.  If anything, the movie portrays a believable struggle between good and evil -- both in our world, and in the spiritual world.",1002240000,2,905,4.63125

1392471,3,B0000541W8,"Come on people, the cinema isn't perfect these days. Very rarely do we get gems these days. Yet, most of the stuff that is being put out is certainly entertaining. And although a large majority of people do not have this movie on their list of entertaining ones, I do. Bless the Child, I think, contains a well thought out story of a young girl who was sent from God. A Satanist who has been searching for her will stop at nothing to make sure he turns her over to the devil.
 The good stuff: Some of the acting. The little girl who plays Cody, Holliston Coleman, was actually very good. Her character never once annoyed or bothered me. She can deliver some strong lines. ""After you."" Yeah, I know, it may sound corny to some people, but while watching the movie and what happened before she said it, kind of chilled me. Christina Ricci did well here. Her character was used to get Kim Basinger's character closer to finding Cody, but wasn't used enough. I really wish they would have broadened her character. It was also nice to see Jimmy Smits put back on the ""cop / detective"" routine. Although this is labeled as a psychological thriller or what have you, there are jump scenes and gore. The jump scenes were pretty much non-effective in some parts, but in anothers, it worked well. I didn't even expect the gore. Yes, there are decapitated heads and knitting needles through eyes here. It surprised me.
 The bad / fair stuff: Um, Kim Basinger really didn't do well here. In her other movies she's been in, she is awesome, but here? She rarely gave a convincing performance. The ending is pretty much where she shines. Rufus Sewell, who was Eric Stark - the villain-  did okay as the Satanist Eric Stark. But he wasn't that much of an intimidation with his actions. Although his performance really never dulled.  I felt as if the beginning of Bless the Child was a bit rushed, but after that, the movie settles into the basic plot, and rides from there. It's not a quick ride. I do admit, sometimes it dragged, but it never lost my interest.
 The DVD's video and audio transfers are pretty good. The colors are done very good. The only supplements on the disc are an audio commentary (Which I have yet to catch), theatrical trailer, and interviews. Would have been nice to at least seen a featurette of some sort.

This movie fits that category pretty well. I would not recommend this to someone who really wants to get into a movie though because there is nothing to dissect. (Go check out PI or the Tin Drum.) There is only enough mentioned about the characters and their motivations to further the plot. And speaking of the plot it's just your basic good vs evil story. Nothing wrong with that if the writer doesn't get to heavy handed, a fate just narrowly missed in this case.
If you're religious then you would probably like Bless the Child for it's religious affirmations. If not then you will probably like it if you are in the right mood to ignore plot holes. You know what I'm talking about...the good guys finding a dirt road that just happen to lead to the back of the bad guy's heavily guarded compound.

Cody was just one of God's many messengers sent here for the greater good, and as we all know there is also the other side that wanted to keep her from her mission.

If you delight in hating movies which positively refers to Christianity, you won't like ""Bless the Child"".  If you believe Satan is sexy and cool, you won't like ""Bless the Child"". If you were exhilarated by the conclusions of ""Seven"", ""The Hitcher"", or ""Fallen"", you won't like ""Bless the Child"". If you are a ""Chapter and Verse"" Christian who cannot stand movies which reference Judeo-Christian  stories and ideas without being too concerned with exactness, you won't like ""Bless the Child"". If you think Catholics are heretics, you won't like ""Bless the Child"". If you believe that God only works with Believers, you won't like ""Bless the Child"". If you think that movies portraying violence or evil behavior are sinful or the cause of the ills of Society today, you won't like ""Bless the Child"". If you read, take phone calls, or leave the room, when you watch movies, or you don't like movies which require that you pay attention, you won't like ""Bless the Child"".

Kim Bassinger is her usual twitchy self (why does she DO that?) If you don't know what I am referring to, watch 'The Real McCoy' or 'I Dreamed of Africa' or this film...she has a tendency to twitch whenever she is injured in some way.  Bassinger does well with what she was offered in this part(twitching aside) and manages to invoke emotion and realism in her somewhat altruistic character.  Jimmy Smits performance was a joke.  Should've stayed with NYPD Blue...at least his character had some depth.  Christina Ricci manages to create a believable character that surfaces from the bottom of the barrel to help save the world.

1392480,3,B0000541W8,"This movie can be effortlessly viewed on autopilot (that's when you're drifting into slumber on your sofa or running hither and thither preparing spaghetti in the kitchen): it's extraordinary predictable and  boasts every clich a movie dabbling with Satan and His coming: a girl destined (?) to become a new Messiah (?), mysterious murders of children by followers of a ""new dawn"" cult (who ""test"" the kids to find the ""one"", but they never show the ""test"" when they finally find ""the one""), their magnanimous chief (dark, big-eyed and outwordly - gorgeous R. Sewell, the only one taking his part seriously) driving a black limo all the time, a priest-turned-cop (or visa versa), some punksters-demons in disguise, swarms of second-best sfx-generated rats and other horny creatures, and the fire-blasting, demon summoning finale in a decaying church.

second...God's power which is blessed to human is never needs to be shown as an ability to light up candels!!!!! He is not a magician....lighting candles up from a farwhat is a wasteful thing to do! and God is not wasteful!!! He heals with His power....not lighting candles up!!!!!!!

The more I watched the movie, the more powerful was my desire to walk to the kitchen and stick a knife in my skull, thereby ending my own life.  OH MAN!
In my opinion, a movie with a plot heavily based on religion has to be careful not to come across as preachy and silly.  This film wasn't too careful in that respect.  This movie made me sad for some of the main stars, because I think they did a good job with their roles, it's just that I felt like their talents were wasted with this movie.  In fact, it was kind of like watching a Jerry Springer episode where an 8 foot crossdresser comes out to confess to his 2-year boyfriend that he's really a man, you know?  The numbskull boyfriend should have known better, but I still can't help but feel sorry for the guy on some level. The actors in this film are just like the surprised Jerry Springer guests.

Sure, it's Silly in places, the Performances are either Over-the-top or Non-Existent, The Special Effects are Obviously Computerised and Unrealistic and the story is too much to stomach, even by ""Devil Movie"" standards.
But, one the Plus side... It's Fun, and not meant to be taken seriously. It is a Rarity in the ""Devil Movie"" sub-genre as it's Ultimately Uplifting, the role reversals from ""The Omen"" work well and there are two or three moments where I was spooked right out of my seat.
On the Performance side, the Bad takes over the Good. I found Kim Basingers Performance to be a Mixed Bag. She is a little too Emotional, but also pretty Believable. Christina Ricci is virtually a Glorified Extra with about 20 minutes screen time. Jimmy Smits looks Bored, Confused, Tired, Scared, Bitter and Lifeless. If this is the best he can do Post-NYPD Blue, than his Career will Assuredly follow David Caruso's.
Rufus Sewell makes up for all his Co-stars Misgivings. His Devilish Role is a Scene Stealers Dream, and he never misses a chance to show up his co-stars. Much like Gabriel Burne in ""End of Days"", Rufus has the Best Lines, the Best Scenes, the Most Talent, the Most Professionalism and he too walks off with the film.

1392498,3,B0000541W8,"Since it was one of the most anticipated events of the century, it only seemed fit that there be a large number of movies that dealt with a premise of possible apocalyptic events that mean the end of the Godly world and signal the coming of darker forces. We were given ""End of Days"" at the tail end of 1999, which was a good try, but missed out by slipping into typical action thriller gimmicks. ""Lost Souls"" also gave us a formula for the world's end, with a man who is destined to become the antichrist and the woman who will stop at nothing to save him. ""Bless the Child"" falls into the category of apocalyptic thrillers, and for all intensive purposes, it does seem to work quite well in the genre.
What keeps me from truly liking this movie as much as I wanted to is the fact that it deals with so many different elements and plot twists, but they never really fit together when the ending comes. It deals with one woman's struggle to find and rescue a small child, all the while battling evil visions that haunt her and the ongoing battle of her faith in God. It's also a story of the accult, which believes in Satan and all his evils, and their wish to bring on specially-powered child into their powerful group to strengthen their actions. But, no matter how hard they try or how much you try to make it work, the two never really fit together, and the end of the film seems to leave more loose ends untied.
When hospital nurse Maggie O'Conner comes home one night and finds her addict sister Jenna on her doorstep, holding a newborn baby and the hope that they can become sisters again. No sooner does she con Maggie into allowing her to stay does she leave, leaving baby Cody in the care of her aunt, who lovingly raises her and brings her up in a healthy home. From the very beginning, Cody is different from other children, and while most doctors think it is a form of autism, Maggie believes otherwise. Cody has the power to make things happen: a bird is willed back to life in her hands, unlit candles spring to life around her, and she feels a strongly emotional connection to the Virgin Mary, whom she says ""is crying for us.""
Meanwhile, there are darker forces at work, looking for one child that has been named as the one that will strengthen the connection between humans and Satan, and when they come across Cody, they know they have found the one. Jenna hops back into the picture, strangely enough with a new boyfriend who leads a spiritual group for drug addicts, and they both demand that Cody come to live with them. They later resort to kidnapping, and it is clear that something more sinister is in store. Maggie goes to the police, but when she is attacked in the subway one night, no one believes her story that she was attacked by members of the cult. Escaping the hospital, she goes on the run in an attempt to retrieve Cody from those who would do her harm, sometimes with thrilling results.
The rundown of the plot is this: the beginning starts out well, leading into a satisfying middle chunk and soon spiralling into an ending that leaves us a bit confused as to what message its really trying to get across to us. When working separately, the elements at hand all work very well, giving us different perspectives about opposing opinions in the field of religion and faith. When you try to put together some of these different elements, you will find that it makes the movie muddled, taking away from what has true potential but never lives up to it. All throughout the movie, I kept waiting for some terrific explosion of everything the movie had been saying up until the ending, wanting to know just what it was trying to tell me. We already knew that the little girl was special, and had the power to heal like no other person alive. We were given the facts as to Maggie's beliefs and disbeliefs about religion, and it was plainly obvious that she had changed them during the middle sequences.
So what is the movie really trying to say in the end? There is something lying underneath all of the plot and storyline that is just screaming to be let out. There has to be. A movie like this does not go so far into the catacombs of religious beliefs and the battle between good and evil, and not have something to show for it in the end. I guess it all just depends on how you look at all the elements of the movie before that makes a difference in how it will affect you after it's over.
There are some good forces at work in this movie, moreso than some of the critics thought after its release in theaters. The many questions that it raises about a person's faith are remarkably affecting. Most intrical to the plot is the symbolism of Jesus being tempted by Satan, when Cody is being tempted by the satanic leader to do things and have faith that God will save her, or deliver her from possible harm. The way in which she keeps her calm, never letting go of her faith in God, will give you chills more than anything else. Also, I truly liked the way in which her powers are displayed, not through grandiose special effects wizardry, but through heartfelt scenes of simple hugs and kind words, like those of Jesus in his teaching and miracles long ago.
The intentions of the cult side of the story seem a bit murky, though. When Sheri, who has escaped the group and knows the whereabouts of Cody, is revealing the group's plans for Cody, she tells of their plan to bring Cody over to their side, or have her killed. I was left with a lot of questions as to what might possibly happen if she were to be brought to their side: would she lose her magical, God-given abilities, or would they segue over into her devilish beliefs if she chose to convert? Also, why was it so important that the cult have her, anyway? Sheri speaks of the group's ability to do horrible things to other people without physical interaction, and that is later demostrated in Cody's test of good and evil. So why would they need her powers anyway?
Despite its flaws, ""Bless the Child"" does deliver a good story, due majorly in part to the acting talents involved. Kim Basinger is the lead as Maggie, and she gives us a powerhouse performance that keeps us involved in the movie. We really do believe that with all that's going on, damnit, she does love that little girl. Jimmy Smits plays the detective assigned to the case, and with all of his past involvement with ""NYPD Blue,"" he breathes real life into his character, who knows what he is talking about and how to deal with his job's frustrations. Rufus Sewell is a chilling cult leader, and you may find yourself frightened by his approach to his beliefs, and how he acts upon them. Holliston Coleman plays Cody, and she gives us a sweet and effective performance that resembles the gentility of Jesus in his day.
Though it can be slightly confusing, ""Bless the Child"" is not that bad. It does keep you entertained while also giving you a unique look at different aspects of religious and non-religious beliefs. The acting will keep you involved with the plot, so just sit back and enjoy the ride. It can be thrilling at times.",983404800,6,7093,4.448540706605223
1392499,2,B0000541W8,"This film is a dreadful attempt at producing a supernatural thriller pitting the forces of good (God) against evil (Satan).  This script is abominable.  The story is utterly unimaginative in its premise and the dialogue is incredibly bad.  The behavior of the characters, especially Maggie (Kim Basinger) is often incongruous and sometimes ludicrous.
The story is about a modern second coming of Christ, with the little Christ girl being born to a drug addict (Angela Bettis) and left with her Aunt Maggie.  The child is being sought out by the disciples of Satan with the intention of converting her to the dark side or killing her.  The army of inept devil worshipers keeps kidnapping her and our mousy heroine single handedly keeps outwitting them and stealing her back followed by interminable car chases pursued by a stretch limo.  Meanwhile, a group of nuns gets together and prays aloud that God will protect Maggie and the child in one of the film's most laughable scenes.  All this culminates in a showdown between God and Satan including some lame visual effects.
A number of reputable actors are wasted on this hack script.  Jimmy Smits is a good actor who gives his standard solid cop portrayal.  Kim Basinger can be excellent in the right role.  She is good in sexy roles, certain dramatic roles and has even proven to be an effective comedian at times.  However, an action heroine she is not and will never be.  The most convincing performance is given by Angela Bettis as Jenna, who looked genuinely strung out on heroine.
Supernatural thrillers provide unlimited possibilities for creativity and imagination.  This pedestrian script is a trite treatment of a familiar story that is poorly written and directed.  I rated it a 3/10.  If you are intent on seeing a ridiculous supernatural thriller see ""End Of Days"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  At least you will get some good action footage with your tripe.",982713600,3,1921,4.937694704049845
1392500,5,B0000541W8,"Some of the special effects could've been done better, but the story was very impressive! Kim Basinger and Ricci were also very good. I wish Ricci had a longer part in the movie though, she was a great touch.  The child's acting ability was brilliant. Going from sheer terror to calm,powerful certainty in the jump scene made the film worth watching alone. Incredible for such a young girl and in such a subject matter! I'm going to add this one to my Video collection of great thrillers.",982627200,8,488,4.609195402298851
1392501,1,B0000541W8,"I was highly anticipating the release of this movie because I had just finished reading the novel. Much to my horror they cut out just about everything in the novel that would have made the movie amazing. They deleted countless (important) characters and reduced Jimmy Smitts role down to almost nothing. I read the book in one sitting it was so amazing, and as I started the movie all I kept thinking was ""Is this it? Is this really it?"" Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smitts did a good job with what they were given, but had the writers kept the screenplay like the novel, their characters would have had a chance to grow and develope and their performances wouldn't have been so shallow. Remember, you cant blame everything on the actors, if the writing stinks there's not too much the actor can do with it. Bottom line-READ THE BOOK!!!! Hopefully it will erase the foul stench this bland movie left.",982454400,2,895,4.6
1392502,3,B0000541W8,"Oh wait..  it's not a dream..  this film had the greatest potential..  it could have been a creative, fesh and spine tingl;ing chiller.. IF THEY HAD TRIED!!!  Kim basinger should stick to chomp at the bit romantic comedies..  The only two things about this movie that didn't completely suck were some graphics strewn throughtout the film and Rufus Sewell playing the bad guy..  his ""henchmen"" were pretty cool..  but Sewell did a great job playing the satanist on a mission to destroy an innocent child of GOD..  if you are really bored and need something to pass the time between Friends reruns..  rent this and take a nap..  otherwise..  don't waste your time..  go with a good end of the world drama and rent The Seventh Sign..",982368000,2,730,4.661417322834645
1392503,5,B0000541W8,"""Bless The Child"" was a truly excellent film, fast paced, full of suspense. The little girl is incredibly impressive in her role, and Basinger and Smits shine as always. The film isn't predictable and contains great interesting images. I really liked the religion angle, and it was nice to see perhaps the most positive portrayal of nuns since Sister Act! Great special effects as well. A winner on all counts.",982281600,3,410,4.871428571428571
1392504,2,B0000541W8,"This is one of those movies that has a good idea but cannot seem to figure out just what to do with it. The early segments of the film are testament to this, because, at first, I was really hooked and enjoying myself and wondering what had sired all those bad reviews I'd read. But mid-way into the film what was subtle becomes blatent, what was creepy becomes cheesy, and what was promising does not ever find its full potential. The climax of the film is completely underwhelming, though mid-way through things start to become more amusing than frightening. All in all, it's a bottom-of-the-wrung supernatural thriller, and if you want to see good against evil on a Biblical scale, check out The Devil's Advocate instead.",982195200,2,723,4.746031746031746
1392505,1,B0000541W8,"First of all, I understand the Christian Faith.  But what I understand more is the art of the cinema.  It does not matter ONE BIT if the film has uplifting Christian values if the whole thing is done with such bad taste and awful storytelling.  A famous critic once said, ""It doesn't matter what the film is about, it's how it is about it"".  This film is awful and I didn't care what happened to the little girl (whose most amazing talent is spinning plates! WOW!)  Poorly executed special effects, such as the demon and the bedroom full of rats, don't help this badly acted and dull klunker.  And enough with the STUPID end of the world, Christian mumbo jumbo, ala ""END OF DAYS"" and ""STIGMATA"".  And just because ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" had a child with special powers, doesn't mean every film does.  Just avoid this CCCCRRRAAAAPPPPP.",982108800,5,829,4.591836734693878
7930490,5,B0000541W8,Good movie! Must have seen this movie multiple times and Kim Basinger is perfect for her role on this one. Just can't wait for the blue ray version to come out so that I can upgrade to high definition. This is a hard to find dvd and it is oop so more likely you will have to scour for used ones and pay a little extra if you do find a sealed copy. Film plot: A gifted child is blessed with divine powers and while there are others like her and they are being hunted down by a satanic cult disguised as a foundation for helping young people. Go get this dvd!,1524528000,,557,3.982142857142857
7930491,2,B0000541W8,"A supernatural thriller, yes.  It is very odd to hear anyone give this movie any religious ties really, because while it is very lightly flavored by Christian themes, it is laughably in no way grounded in any point of theological relevance aside from a spiritual name-drop here and there and a very shallow ideal of good versus evil.  The arch-angel Tinkerbell makes a guest appearance.

Oh, and the chosen one uses the force!",1521158400,,426,4.808219178082192
