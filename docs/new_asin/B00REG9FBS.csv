8695197,1,B00REG9FBS,I was expecting a documentary style film on Babe Ruth. American Hercules is a nonsense film that tries to compare the Babe with Hercules. It doesn't include baseball people talking about Ruth's accomplishments but has scientist and others talking about mythological things and trying to connect Ruth to them. The whole film borders on ridiculous. Even the footage of Ruth is shown against a backdrop of and old castle so you never see him clearly. There have been several fine documentaries on Babe by A&E Biography and HBO seek them out. Don't waste your money on this one it was a major disappointment.,1463616000,,604,4.87378640776699

8695199,4,B00REG9FBS,"Tale of a boy who at the age of seven ended up at a boy's home as his parents got divorced, dad said mom was a drinker. While there the boy learned the game of baseball.

At age 19 he signed a minor league contract and soon was with the Boston Red Sox as a good pitcher. He did some hitting and soon went to the New York Yankees. Aspired for a family with not much results. Chronicles his successes  and faults. Insightful. Old photos and footage. Interviews. Aspires to compare him to mythology. Insightful.",1448236800,,508,4.336842105263158
