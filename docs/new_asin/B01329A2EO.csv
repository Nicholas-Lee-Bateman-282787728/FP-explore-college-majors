8726912,4,B01329A2EO,"My 2.5 year old daughter loves paw patrol! We have a portable DVD player and i wanted to get her some paw patrol to have on the go. This DVD comes with a mini sticker sheet , mini coloring book with 4 crayons and a small poster which my daughter tore up right away. It has 8 episodes and runs for a total of about 90 minutes. My favorite part is that the audio options come in 3 languages; english, spanish and french. I really like this because we are a bilingual family and encourage our daughter to speak spanish and we cant ever switch the audio to spanish when we watch paw patrol on tv. It was a really nice surprise to see that option available. The DVD keeps my daughter entertained, it was a good buy and the only reason I deducted a star is because its widescreen which isn't a huge deal but makes a bit of a difference when you are watching on a small player. I would recommend this DVD to any parent of a paw patrol lover.",1496102400,4,934,4.109289617486339
