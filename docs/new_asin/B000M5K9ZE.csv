2725652,4,B000M5K9ZE,"Well, actually the pacing is pretty much like .Hack//Sign and the story feels much more like that series than the disappointing .Hack//Legend of the Twilight, so if the first series was good for you then this season looks like it probably will be. For those new to the .Hack series this set will probably be infuriating and impenetrable.

But I like it.",1181001600,5,353,4.693548387096774
2725653,3,B000M5K9ZE,The episodes on this DVD are slow to get to a point.  The creators seem to be trying (too hard and needlessly) to emphasize that there's more than what you see going on.  If you've watched .hack//SIGN then I think this will be somewhat more interesting to you because it feels like a continuation.,1180828800,4,297,4.481481481481482
2725654,1,B000M5K9ZE,"As with all Anime great animation and art work.  Slow boaring story, no depth to characters a waste of my time.",1178928000,,111,4.285714285714286
2725655,5,B000M5K9ZE,"A truley amazing start to hte series, the Shirt is really cool, and the soundtrack is excellent, that box will hold a few more DVDs for when they come out!

Recommended for .hack// Fans.",1178928000,3,186,4.470588235294118
2725656,5,B000M5K9ZE,"I own this on japanese dvd and I'll tell ya, this is only beaten by .hack//sign.  This series has better animation, and more fighting. But sign had a wack story line. Well anyways If your a .hack//  fan or if you play the games, or if youve seen either sign or roots on cartoon network I recomend this item. I guarentee you won't be disapointed",1174003200,9,344,4.276923076923077

8166527,5,B000M5K9ZE,"Honestly Im going to be speaking of .hack/roots as a whole. A lot of people may say the pacing is slow and what not however in .hack/sign (the most overrated of the series) it was a whole mess from one episode to next complete randomness and too many emo moments , its alright to have those dark emotional reflecting scenes but sign just spammed that and took it to a new level way to much! For Legend of the twilight princess they took a more lighter child like approach and the incest made it a little akward still a good series though

Roots to me is a good mesh of both  however I might be a little bias due to the fact I've played GU and loved it (also a very underrated game compare to the quadrilogy) Go into it with an open mind and enjoy.",1388016000,,747,4.109589041095891
8166528,2,B000M5K9ZE,"This dvd is a set of episodes about about a virtual reality
game called ""The World"". In this one the two guilds are rivals for membership
and finding the ultimate secret of the game.
The theme music is kind of irritating at times,
but some of the composition as background music are really kind of well done.
The male main character is the newbie Haseo
who actually appears more female looking than male by western standards.
no one would be caught dead with his hair-do?
Or the cheesy jump suit he wears either...The female
players seem either weaker or more evil than their male counterparts.
The format is kind of hypnotic in effect and seems meant
to get kids to buy into online multiperson
interactive gaming as a sport.",1259107200,,725,4.627906976744186

8166530,3,B000M5K9ZE,"Great package.
GREAT package...

This anime will bore the nuts off a tree.
Unless you know this anime, and love this anime, don't rush into a purchase.
The games were fun and silly, but longwinded.  This anime does more of that but without the action of the game, and with even slower and less poignant dialogue.  I was hoping it would be like //SIGN where there was talking but it felt the characters connected and solved a mystery.  //ROOTS is a lot of talking that goes nowhere and means nothing.  You can definitely play the games without knowing anything from this anime series.  The only part it fills out for the gamer is Phyllo's placement within the game; though he doesn't show up in the game, his legacy is handed down.

You have to be hard core to enjoy this anime.",1221091200,2,777,4.468085106382978
8166531,3,B000M5K9ZE,"For myself, neither of the dot.hack tv series are very enjoyable unless you're simultaneously playing the video game series that compliment each one.  I find both SIGN and ROOTS boring except to provide additional background for the action-packed video games.

The later episodes of ROOTS, like SIGN, actually matter to the overall story and have some action.  It's worth the wait.",1189296000,,381,5.213114754098361
8166532,4,B000M5K9ZE,"I am originally a .hack//SIGN fan, and I'm reluctantly sticking with project .hack to see where the story goes. With the original The World destroyed and ""R2"" created, it's become much more shallow and technological. There is less intrigue, magic, wonder. It's a story where the gods are dead and mysteries are gone. Trying to keep the typically mysterious theme going, they impliment it in one character: Ovan. No one knows what his deal is or what his motives are, but it doesn't really tell you anything to keep you watching. The pacing is far slower than //SIGN, and it takes much more patience to get through it. The animation seems to remain constant, which is a plus from //SIGN, but the storyline is very slow, reserved only for the diehard .hack fans.",1187740800,2,760,4.7218045112781954
8166533,2,B000M5K9ZE,"As some others have stated, I was a huge fan of the .Hack//sign series.  When I saw roots, I was very excited to see the next generation of characters.  However, I quickly got over that excitement.

As others have said, the pacing is off.  Nothing much seems to go on for large chunks of time.  On top of that, one of the things that really turned me off were the characters in general.  It's like every griefer from every MMO you've ever played all banded together in one place.  I can't stand those people in my games, and they're not any more entertaining when I watch them animated on my television.  The heroes aren't really much better, and it's hard for me to get on their side, or become emotionally invested in their quest.

Whatever happened to wreck The World, it wrecked the francise too.  This is for die hard fans only.",1185494400,3,833,4.421052631578948
