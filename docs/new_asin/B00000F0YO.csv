1201609,3,B00000F0YO,"Others have commented on the film's classic status so I won't repeat those comments here. Instead, I just want to warn potential purchasers of the video quality. The picture lacks resolution and colors are smeared with poor edge integrity (meaning the colors of objects smear into adjacent areas). The colors are also artificially intense. Overall, the copy quality is about on a par with that of real-time dubs using home VHS equipment. Given that we now live in a world of high quality [price]tapes from the major studios, the quality of this tape given its extremely high price is ludicrous. The rating is three stars: 4 for the movie and 2 for the tape copy (I have seen poorer quality tapes but at least the sellers charged a price consistent with the quality of the tapes).
Note: For future readers, this review applies to the videotape copy of the film sold by Jef Films during the year 2001 ...",1011052800,22,902,4.679245283018868
1201610,5,B00000F0YO,"If you like Sophia's comic side, as well as her very serious side, you will find this an excellent movie!!! After being told that distribution of the movie in the U.S. was discontinued some years back, and after searching for quite some time, I eventually found and purchased (at a premium, though!) a VHS copy of this movie here on Amazon.com in March 2001. I was quite pleased to possess a copy of ""Marriage, Italian Style"" and later purchased Sophia's ""Two Women"" from Amazon as well. I originally wrote this review in 2001 but revised it today (June 2011) just to state that the VHS copy I purchased in 2001 did not have any problems with picture quality or sound - unlike much of what I have read here with regards to the DVD version.",983404800,4,739,4.481481481481482
1201611,4,B00000F0YO,"I consider this film to be the best teaming of SOPHIA and MARCELLO. They are both wonderful in this satire dealing with a prostitute who wants to trick a long time client to a marriage. Seeing SOPHIA LOREN in a spiderweb almost killed me ,since i was a teenager the first time i saw it. They should however take down the price. Weren't we lucky guys to have women like SOPHIA LOREN as models?. Those were the days indeed, now we're stuck with tall actresses so skinny they seem to disappear.",972777600,6,491,4.406593406593407

1201656,3,B00000F0YO,Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this slow moving snoozefest. But this movie doesn't deserve 4 stars. Sophia Loren deserves 5 stars for being her but this movie is just boring and not much ever happens.

1201658,5,B00000F0YO,"Made my cry at the end.  Very much a story of Naples and Southern Italy and it's population from WWII to the early 60's - and likely to its present.  The passion and depth of its people, and especially as it relates to family is interesting and enthralling.  The only unfortunate thing (for me) is that my Italian was not good enough to listen well, and my understanding of the Neapolitan dialect has long past along with my relatives; so, in parts, I was unable to keep up with the action and the subtitling, so I needed to fill the gaps on my own. Thank goodness for the acting of Mastroianni and Loren.  Their chemistry is fabulous and allowed the gaps to fill readily.",1465776000,2,672,4.395161290322581

Both are just phenomenal in their range and effortless artistry - and their combined physical beauty is just about blinding. It's an amazing films that manages to be funny, sad, brave, moving and everything in between. The ending is an act of courage on De Sica's part - thank God this wasn't filmed in the US - I can only imagine the ending Hollywood would have decreed!

For it is the English-dubbed version that really sparkles, where the dramatic moments are played against the comedic ones more strikingly. Sophia Loren and ""Marcello Mastroianni"" are wry, amusing and laugh-out-loud funny in the dubbed version inserting different lines from the original Italian all the while retaining the heart-pulling moments. Other films give us the luxury of different languages, why not this one? Loren copped a Best Actress nod for her work here. I wonder which version the Academy members saw.

1201854,2,B00000F0YO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I couldn't remember if I had seen 'Marriage Italian Style' years ago so I decided to take a look at it, now far into my middle age. I was expecting a sophisticated comedy since after all, the director was the famed Vittorio De Sica. Unfortunately, I must confess that I was disappointed. Not that the acting was so bad--after all, superstars such as Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni usually never proffer up performances to sneeze at. Nonetheless, it was obvious from the start, that De Sica was working from a script that is now woefully dated.

'Marriage Italian Style' begins in the present time when the movie was made (early 60s). Loren plays Filumena Marturano who is pretending to be grievously ill, in one last desperate attempt to trick Domenico Soriano (Mastrioianni) into marrying her. We then flashback to when the couple met, (which was during World War II) when Filumena was working as a prostitute in a brothel and Domenico, a successful businessmen, begins a relationship with her. The comedy is supposed to stem from Domenico's awkward attempts to hide his infidelity from Filumena but she's always one step ahead of him.

Eventually Domenico 'ups' his commitment to her by offering to take her into his home as an unofficial mistress. At first, Filumena appears honored since his mother lives there and she plans on establishing a good rapport with the mother, in order to solidify her relationship with Domenico. The relationship with the mother immediately becomes a burden when it becomes clear that the mother is hopelessly senile!

After Filumena's charade is exposed, she has one last card to play: she reveals that she has three children and one of them is fathered by Domenico. Now the comic plot shifts as Domenico keeps trying to figure out who is the son. After he basically kicks Filumena out of his home and plans never to see her again, he eventually has a change of heart, realizing the error of his ways in trying to favor one child over the two others.

One wonders why Filumena is drawn back to the cad Domenico due to the way in which he has mistreated through the years. The answer of course is that Filumena is a) pretty much emotionally dependent on him despite the bad treatment, b) financially dependent and c) lacking in self- esteem to walk away.

The sudden change of heart by Domenico, to go back to Filumena and accept the three children as his own, seems unlikely, given his years of philandering. Nonetheless, a la Hollywood, the happy ending appears pre-ordained.

Even though you might expect a film such as this which features such big stars, to be an instant classic, even the best directors can do little, if they're saddled with a weak script!",1414800000,,2745,4.790697674418604

She should have won her second Oscar for this but Julie Andrews had been messed over for My Fair Lady so Hollywood decided to make up to Julie.  The product itself is exceptional.

As with ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" and ""Casanova '70"", their Blu-ray editions (and I suspect the same with the DVD) are the most quality presentations there have been to these much known foreign films.  ""Marriage, Italian Style"" had the distinction to receive nominations for Best Foreign Film and Best Actress (the second) for Sophia Loren for Academy Awards.  She is quite excellent in this, but Julie Andrews won that year for ""Mary Poppins.""  Sophia indisputably won in 1961 for her performance in another Vittorio de Sica film, ""Two Women.""  Here de Sica directs his two stars of his Academy Award winning ""Best Foreign Film,"" ""Yesterday Today and Tomorrow,"" Marcello Mastroianni and Loren in extraordinary star performances as extraordinary characters that display with power the essence of matrimony, even in the complicated laws of the Italians.  They are at their peaks here.  The writing by Eduardo De Filippo and Renato Castellani, the images by cinematographer Roberto Gerardi and the magnificent music by Armando Travajoli are all equally brilliant.  Everyone in the cast is superb.  It is the best Italian movie I have ever seen.  It is indeed a rewarding experience and never patronizing.  It presents marriage as human and personal.  Produced by Carlo Ponti in Technicolor and with subtitles.  Now, as it always should have been.  Watch it often to experience the film as it was in theaters in 1964 and let it resonate in your mind, the joy and pathos, the drama within, the sumptuous images, acting and music.  Mastroianni and Loren make being Italian a beautiful heritage and make the pseudo look of it in the movie version of ""Nine"" seem phony.

1202089,4,B00000F0YO,"Vittorio De Sica, the filmmaker and actor who captured the attention of the world through Italian Neo-Realism with films such as ""Shoeshine"", ""The Bicycle Thief"" and ""Umberto D."".

Known for his neorealist films in the '40s and '50s, by the '60s, De Sica was a man who did what he wanted to do and that meant changing genres and experimenting with various themes. And in 1961, he would go on to create a film that would feature an all-star Italian and American cast titled ""The Last Judgement"" (Il Giudizio Universale) and also go from creating films about the poor to the people flourishing during the post-war economic boom (known as the Italian Economic Miracle) in which Italy would transform itself to a major industrial power starting from the '50s through the '70s. A subject that De Sica would focus in his 1963 comedy film ""Il Boom"".

While known for his neorealistic films and also his starring role in the 1957 film ""A Farewell to Arms"" (which De Sica received a ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" Academy Award nomination), his 1963 film ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" (Ieri, oggi, domani) would win an Academy Award in 1965 for ""Best Foreign Language Film"".

With the collaboration with actress Sophia Loren (""Two Women"", ""Boccasio '70', ""Marriage Italian Style"") and actor Marcello Mastroianni (""Divorce Italian Style"", ""La Notte"", ""La Dolce Vita"", ""8 1/2') resulting in success, the three reunited  again for the 1964 film ""Marriage Italian Style"" (""Matrimonio all'italiana""). The film is the second onscreen adaptation of the play ""Filumena Marturano"" by Eduardo De Filippo.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" in 1966 and also a nomination for ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" for Sophia Loren in 1965.

To celebrate the working relationship with filmmaker Vittorio De Sica, Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, Kino Lorber have released three Blu-ray titles and a special four-disc DVD set featuring ""Yesterday Today, Tomorrow"", ""Marriage Italian Style"" and ""Sunflower"") as part of ""The Sophia Loren Award Collection"".

VIDEO:

I have to admit that I was a bit surprised that ""Marriage Italian Style"" was given a Blu-ray release but considering it is one of the well-known Vittorio De Sica Sophia Loren films, I can understand why Kino Lorber was released on DVD and Blu-ray.  The film is presented in 1080p (1:85:1).

While it is great to see this film available in HD, I caution those who are expecting pristine picture quality.  You can tell that this print has not aged gracefully through the years and its important to note that similar to other De Sica films at the time, they chose to go with a more economical choice for film than the best quality available to them.

With that being said, there is mild flickering, there are white speckles and dust, a lot of grain, colors are not exactly vibrant and black levels are OK.  While some parts of the film look great and this is probably one of the few films where videophiles can easily debate the use of DNR.  If anything, Kino kept to the original print and not mess with it, so people are getting a film transferred to high definition.

But it's important to remember that if you want any of these Vittorio De Sica/Sophia Loren films, you either buy the DVD boxset or buy the Blu-ray release individually.  Personally, if you love the film and I do feel it is the better of the three films in the Sophia Loren Award Collection, the Blu-ray release is the way to go.

AUDIO:

""Marriage Italian Style"" is presented in Italian Dolby TrueHD 1.0. The lossless monaural track is still clear in dialogue and everything comes quite clear through the center channel. Granted, I did choose to watch the entire film in stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape.

I didn't notice any hissing, pops or crackle and for the most part, soundtrack is what I was expecting from the lossless monaural soundtrack.

Optional English subtitles are included.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Marriage Italian Style"" comes with the theatrical trailer (3:41) and the trailers for the three De Sica/Loren films that are available from Kino Lorber.  Also, a stills gallery with 28 images from behind-the-scenes and promotional images as well.

EXTRAS:

""Marriage Italian Style"" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a Vittorio De Sica fan, knowing that many viewer's exposure of his work are through his neorealist films, let's step away from that and not focus too much on De Sica's past work but focus on what he has done in 1960.

Sophia Loren literally became the filmmaker's muse.  Beginning with ""Two Women"" in 1960, he would follow up film after film with Loren, ""Boccaccio '70' and ""The Condemned of Altona in 1962, his Academy Award winning film ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" (1963) which featured the first major collaboration between De Sica, Loren and Mastroianni.  And to follow-up a year later with ""Marriage Italian Style"".

While ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" did win an Oscar and while it was a fun comedy anthology that showcased Loren's body and sexuality, Loren was more than just a beautiful buxom actress, she was also a talented actress that can dish it out like any major actress out there.  You want her to play sexy, she will play sexy.  You want her to play a woman who has been jilted for nearly 20-years and want to see that frustration, she absolutely delivers in ""Marriage Italian Style"".

In fact, this is a very different film than ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"".  While sex does play a part, this film is not much about the comedy, it actually focus on the emotional drama and toll it takes on Sophia Loren's character Filumena Marturano. We have seen Loren give a superb performance in De Sica's ""Two Men"" but she shines again in ""Marriage Italian Style"".

And Marcello Mastroianni, he also delivers in a superb performance as their characters both feed off each other's anger, stress and passion.  The scene which involves Filumena giving a peace of her mind to Domenico about how she really feels and the fact that she has three sons was quite powerful.  She embodied the character of Filumena and I felt that she was absolutely on fire!

Mastroianni played the convincing role of the suave, wealthy older gentlemen, with the graying highlights and all, he looked the part, he played the part and he delivered!

And I do believe that the film was very much deserving of its two Academy Award nominations as this was the better film compared to ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" when it came to story and performance.

But while I enjoyed ""Marriage Italian Style"", it's important for those who are planning to purchase the Blu-ray to know that this film is not pristine by any means.  In fact, some may find the film unlike any film they see on Blu-ray because of its high level of grain, minor flickering, dust and speckles and so forth.  Yes, the film has been given the 1080p High Definition upgrade but Kino Lorber does not do restorations like other niche companies specializing in cinema.  They take the film elements and give you an HD version of those film elements and suffice to say, because restoration is extremely expensive, not all films that come to Blu-ray are given significant restorations.  Even from the major studios.

As for special features, this one is pretty much barebones.  While ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" contained the Vittorio De Sica documentary, I was hoping there would be some revisiting by Sophia Loren or someone involved with the film.  Also, may there be an audio commentary or something else that would make this release much more attractive to Blu-ray fans.

And this brings me back to the man who is responsible for directing the film, Vittorio De Sica.  Like Fellini, Rosellini, Visconti and Antonioni, De Sica is a legendary filmmaker in my eyes.  While not all De Sica's films were magnificent hits, the fact is that throughout his oeuvre, he has created a few masterpiece.  Not one, not two...there are quite a few that surprise you with its overall look but performances that really are heartwrenching.

While ""Two Women"" was a powerful film featuring Sophia Loren, the primary focus of ""The Sophia Loren Award Collection"" is to feature three major collaborations between De Sica, Loren and Mastroianni.  And for me, this is important because if you want to enjoy ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"", you must watch ""Marriage Italian Style"" and ""Sunflower"" and pretty much, if you enjoy the working relationship between these three talented individuals, it's worth watching each of these films.  By no means, are each of these films their best work but its a collaboration that remains special for cinema fans and fans of each of these three individuals.

And as De Sica brought out the performances of both Loren and Mastroianni, for me, this was like the Italian equivalent of a William Powell and Myrna Loy or Clark Gable and Myrna Loy ala early '60s.  They may have not made that many films than their Hollywood counterparts but they did have great chemistry onscreen for these three films presented in the collection.

Overall, while ""Marriage Italian Style"" is not the best looking film on Blu-ray nor does it contain a lot of special features, it still is an enjoyable film.  So, if you are a big fan of Vittorio De Sica, Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, ""Marriage Italian Style"" is worth giving a try!",1312156800,3,9401,4.887208569628229

Sadly many have panned this DVD because of ""poor quality"", ""awful dubbing"", ""illegible sub-tiltles"", not to mention those that incorrectly state that this is a movie about a ""middle class couple"".  First of all if this DVD is played on a PAL player there is no problem whatsoever with its quality.  If it is played on a US format player the quality suffers somewhat, languages cannot be selected nor can subtitles be switched on.  I know because I watched it in my US player AND in my MAC computer that can handle PAL.
I first saw this movie in my youth, before having lived in Italy or speaking the language fluently.  I loved it then and now that i understand all its nuances and I am fluent in Italian (whether Neapolitan, Sicilian or any of the many dialects) I must classify it as a MASTERPIECE.  It is funny yet manages to accurately portray the customs and peculiarities of life in this amazing country.

1202188,4,B00000F0YO,"Sophia Loren is at the top of her game in this 1964 film by Vittorio de Sica, and she and Marcello Mastroianni display real chemistry acting together. The story is much more than just a slick comedy, and can keep you guessing what's coming next.

Most of the reviews here complain bitterly about the poor quality of the DVD transfer. Well, it isn't great, but I've seen far worse. And it's really only in the first few minutes of the movie that the video quality is especially poor; it improves considerably a little further on, and then remains that way.

At least one reviewer has remarked that without subtitles the video quality is much better. There's a simple explanation for this. There are actually two separate complete copies of the movie on the DVD, taken from different sources. If you'll notice, the Carlo Ponti Italian release (without subtitles) begins with red curtains, whereas the Joseph E Levine American release, with burned-in subtitles, omits that intro. The original Italian copy that was used for that portion of the DVD was in much better condition than the original of the American release.

The bottom line is, if you care more about how sharp your picture is than about the qualities of the movie itself, then this is definitely to be avoided. But if you're able to excuse a less-than-pristine copy of an important film, or alternately, if you can manage some Italian without subtitles, then go for it.

--------------------------------------------
EDIT: One previous reviewer complained that the movie is dubbed, and another complained that the English version was wanted but the Italian version had been sent.

Neither of the two different copies on this DVD is dubbed into English; both are in the original Italian. I'm not aware of a dubbed version ever having been made. The American release of the movie has subtitles in English (granted, not the best or most complete job of subtitling possible, but not at all bad -- they're in the film stock itself rather than being added for the DVD, and are exactly the same as what you would have seen in a theater in 1964), while the Italian copy does not.

I sense a bit of piling-on in these reviews -- something doesn't meet your highest expectations, and then you find all these 1-star reviews here, which just reinforces your own disappointment, so you add another one instead of putting the situation into perspective. Many of these old Joseph E Levine releases of foreign films are in fair-to-poor condition, and the DVD issuer used the best copy they could find; they didn't screw it up just out of laziness or to annoy people. It's true that with a lot of expensive equipment and an enormous amount of time and labor a film can go through a restoration process where each frame is digitally cleaned up, and perhaps eventually an outfit like Criterion may turn their attention to this one. In the meantime, this is what there is.

So don't buy this DVD unless you're willing to watch a great movie with less-than-perfect video.",1199577600,20,3010,4.810444874274662

""Marriage Italian Style"" is director Vittorio De Sica's fourth collaboration with the actress Sophia Loren. Loren's sensual beauty, fine comic timing, combined with a brilliant script and the rare chemistry with the co-star Marcello Mastroianni makes the film an excellent combination of a  sparkling and amusing farce and a poignant drama of one woman's life and struggles. As Domenico Soriano, a wealthy, arrogant and selfish Neapolitan businessman, Mastroianni is on the verge of marrying a younger woman when he hears that his long time mistress, ex-prostitute Filomena, is on her deathbed. He rushes to her side and agrees to marry Filomena and soon become a widower but when she recovers ""miraculously"" he recognizes that her illness was only a trick. Then, in her flashbacks, we learn that she did it for the sake of her three children of whom Domenico knew nothing about and one of them (or maybe all) could be his... Mastroianni and Loren had perhaps the best on-screen chemistry ever; it is delight to see them together in this film as well as in ""Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow"" and ""The Sunflowers"" - little known but wonderful Soviet - Italian film, both by Vittorio De Sica. I also liked them together in Altman's ""Prt--Porter"" (1994) aka ""Ready to Wear"". One scene in Marriage Italian Style should be on the list of the best ever filmed - young Filomena walks down a sidewalk in Naples to meet with Dominico and every man, regardless of his age stares at her. I am a woman but I could not take my eyes off her - Cleopatra or Nefertity could've walked like that. My verdict - they don't make comedies like that anymore.

I was really looking forward to the release of that film, but the result is not only disappointing but also a disaster. Of course, one can not always demand a transfer quality on the level that criterion has established with its releases (""divorce italian style"", to cite just one example of that great collection), but there is a minimum of quality standards to be followed.

Although amazon is neither responsible for the content nor the quality standards of the offered products, they should be able to find a way to rate new products in the DVD section initially.

First you are supposed to assume or take as fact, that the two stars have this deep and loving connection from the beginning, that somehow they've always loved each other. I call BS. First of all, no screen time was ever use to demonstrate this. Not even a single scene to establish that they have anything other than a superficial relationship. Him, a wealthy guy looking for some arm candy. Her, a plotting manipulator looking for a wealthy man to take his name for her ""three sons"". Sons, who, by the way, are not introduced until 2/3 the way into the movie as a kind of desperate plot twist to I don't know, give this movie any kind of plot, at all. So by the end, you have a contrived situation where the jerk guy is told that one of her bastard children is his own, he has a mid-life crisis, and in a particularly trite, cheap twist, both horridly unlikable characters have a ""change of heart"" while lying in the sand on the beach. The next scene is these two people, who we've spent the entire movie watching these two selfish people mistreat, yell, scream, cheat on each other, basically, the most dysfunctional relationship that could possibly exist. And then suddenly it's all erased instantly, they get MARRIED, move back into their big condo and live life happily ever after with her three sons. Sons who, throughout her entire life, know her only as that weird woman who shows up every once in a while with pastries. It's all terribly contrived, the script falls completely flat and there is not a shred of emotional impact at any point in the movie. Sophia Loren is not very attractive for the sole reason that her character is unlikable. Why would you take a beautiful woman like Loren and cast her as a scheming, lying, emotionally immature prostitute totally beholden to some jerk? Are we supposed to like ANY of these characters? IF so, the writers know absolutely nothing about human beings. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1517443200,,2054,4.554054054054054

Unfortunately, there are a few scenes that have been edited out this and it is a shame because one of them shows Sofia's phenomenal legs.  More importantly, it is a transition scene.  So, you won't understand why she goes from a young woman in a house of il-repute to an older woman with red hair and a nice dress who is sitting in Marcello Mastrianni's car in the rain storm.  They cut out the scene where her character and Marcello's character meet again a few years later after they first met.  They also cut out the scene where the Priest persuades Marcello's character (Don Domenico) to marry the dying Sofia character (Filomena Marturano).  It's a quality DVD but comes up a little short.
