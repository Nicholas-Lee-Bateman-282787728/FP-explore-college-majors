786350,5,6304132654,"Sesame Street's monsters shine in this song-filled, 30-minute video. Highlights are Grover's ""What Do I Do When I'm Alone?"" and Cookie Monster's ""C Is For Cookie"", both from 1971. More obscure favorites are 1975's ""Fur"" and ""Frazzle"". For those Elmo fans out there, be forewarned: this video came out before Elmo became huge, and therefore, has minimal representation. If you love the monsters and if you love good songs, this video is for you!  END",894844800,13,449,4.986666666666666

786456,5,6304132654,"this video is so cute and adorable!
my 3 year old loves it. he loves sesame street and it did take him some time to warm up to this video but now he loves it. I like it a lot because it has characters that are not so common, so they feel fresh and new. Also Herry monster is a lot in it and he's one of my favorites. Elmo is in it but is not the main character which is nice for a change. This video is not all about elmo like it seems to be now a days. The songs are really fun!! I have them in my head all the time!",1318118400,,517,3.543859649122807
786457,5,6304132654,"I have been looking for this tape for a longtime. Watched it on VHS when I was a kid. Song on this program include C is for cookie, Fuzzy and Blue, That Furry Blue Mommy of Mine, Frazzle, Cookie Monster's healthy food rap. This DVD chronicles the greatest songs from the first 20 years of this groundbreaking children's series sung of course by favorite Sesame Street Muppet friends as they present the first ever ""Fuzzy Award"". I recommend this DVD to any fan of Sesame Street. Your kids and grand kids will dance and sing along every day for years to come.",1310169600,,558,4.480392156862745
786458,5,6304132654,"I was completely overjoyed when I saw this dvd on amazon. I have old school seasame street books back from 30 years ago from my older brother, so I am quite familar with the old monsters. My almost 1 year old son loves frazzle, everytime he sees a page with him in it he kicks his legs and gives me a huge smile. :-D I am saving this for his birthday in november but my friend has the dvd also so I did get to view it and it was very musical and fun, an attention grabbing for any young kid. My son always bobs his head when he hears his music, so it is perfect for him.",1251417600,,570,3.8389830508474576

786461,5,6304132654,"This is by far the best Sesame Street DVD by Sony Wonder. My 19 month old loves it, especially Frazzle. He repeatedly asks for Frazzle by going ""Arghhh"" and shaking his head. It is also nice to hear some of the old songs I had in my Sesame collection, like Fur, Frazzle, and C is for Cookie. 10/10",1195171200,,297,4.137931034482759

786463,5,6304132654,"This is one of the best theme-oriented Sesame Street videos, a collection of songs sung by various monster Muppets, notably the super-blue, super-furry Herry Monster, who co-hosts the ""Fuzzy Awards,"" a Grammy-style award show that provides the glue for the video release.  Elmo is Herry's co-host, but other than some comedic skits during the interludes, Elmo is admirably in the background on this one... More Herry!  More Grover!  More Cookie Monster!  Now you're talking my language.  My kid loves this one, and so do the big people in the household.",1174003200,,553,5.1

786545,4,6304132654,"My daughter is 17 months old, and next to Rock and Roll, this is probably her least favorite of the Sesame Street movies (and we have a lot of them).  If your child is like mine and likes the characters she sees a lot of on Sesame Street (Elmo, Ernie, Cookie, Grover, etc.), they might not be as interested in this one (although Elmo is the cohost of the awards show with Herry).  It is nice to see the monsters that don't get a lot of play, though.  Herry Monster is in about half of the songs.  It is worth it if you don't have any videos with Monster in the Mirror (also on Rock and Roll), Fuzzy and Blue (on Sesame Street 25th Anniversary), or C is for Cookie (on several of the DVDs).",1139875200,2,689,4.0814814814814815
786546,5,6304132654,"I had this on vhs when my now 13 and 16 year old were very small. They loved it. I can't tell you how many times a week this tape played. I still find myself singing some of the songs (although I had forgotten a lot of the words) After having my ""change of life"" baby last spring, I had hoped I could find this b/c it is a bit older. I was so excited I had. My first  two loved it and I know this little guy will too.",1129248000,,417,3.6333333333333333
786547,5,6304132654,"Okay I admit it, I never really outgrew Sesame Street and I have bought numerous DVDs for my children.  All these years later, they still have the ability to enthrall children.

And of course for adults it brings back many memories of childhood as you revisit some things you have not seen in quite awhile.

Of course the songs remain in your head, and after you hear C is For Cookie a few times, you may find yourself humming it now and again, and you can always tell who has young children if they hear you humming it and give you a knowing smile :)

All in all, you cannot go wrong with Sesame Street videos.",1127260800,3,611,4.241379310344827
786548,5,6304132654,"My son is close to sixteen months old at the time of this writing, and over a year ago he started loving this video. To this day, except for the Grover's song, ""What Do I Do When I'm Alone"", playing it on our VCR is an automatic way to get him to calm down, no matter his mood.

This video will give you so much mileage and make your child smile in such a unique way, you will wonder how could anyone want to ever get rid of it. It's by all means the video that has given us in the family more moments of joy since Santiago was born. I wish you the same fortune.",1106870400,5,562,3.8448275862068964
786549,5,6304132654,"Sometimes it takes a few viewings to get into a video in our house.  I always preview the tapes before my 17 month old watches them, just to make sure they aren't too scary.  I watched this one twice, I loved it so much!  This tape is now played every day without fail, and we all love it.  Don't be put off by the style of the songs.  They aren't really modern sounding, but they are so catchy, that you can't help but love them.  Remember that these tapes are for your child, but you have to watch them, too.  Enjoy!!",1044576000,2,519,4.079207920792079
786550,4,6304132654,"Similar to ""The Best of Kermit"" this is arranged as an ""award show"" - but it contains a fabulous collection of clips with your favorite monsters, and some you've never seen before!
Herry and Elmo host the ""Fuzzy Awards,"" and though Elmo can hardly wait to open the envelope, Herry manages to make him behave while they play the nominees - ""Fur,"" just for fun, ""Herry's Family Song,"" comparing Herry and his parents, ""Frazzle,"" - who says ""arrrgh!"" no matter what he feels, ""Two Heads Are Better than One"", with the two-headed monster, ""Fuzzy and Blue (and Orange!)"" with the terrific trio of Grover, Herry, and Cookie (and Frazzle), ""Comb Your Face,"" ""Healthy Food,"" a Cookie Monster rap, ""What Do I Do When I""m Alone"" with Grover (what happened to Being Afraid?) and, of course ""C is for Cookie.""
My favorite moment in the show is the achievement award, which Herry gives to ""That Furry Blue Mommy of Mine,"" a song remeniscent of ""Dream a Little Dream"" that makes me give my boy an extra squeeze.
Enjoy!
PS.  One small dissapointment:  it doesn't include ""Monster in the Mirror,"" which surprised me.",1042588800,15,1100,4.7539267015706805
786551,5,6304132654,"I've bought quite a few used videos lately, as the selection is better than what the stores are carrying lately for Sesame Street.  This video is a riot and my daughter begs for it almost daily.  Set-up like an awards show, the songs ""Fur"" and ""Fuzzy and Blue"" are fun and entertaining even for adults.  I like this video because it includes the character Frazzle, who was dropped because he was deemed ""too scary"" to kids.  My 2 year old LOVES Frazzle and begs for his song over and over.  How's that for scary?  This video is cute and the songs are fun.  From the songs mentioned above to ""C is for Cookie"" this video contains lots of monster fun!",1020211200,3,649,4.358333333333333
786552,4,6304132654,"Parents,
This is a great Sesame Songs Video. My 8 year old son loves Cookie Monster and I wanted to find a video that did include him. Tap along as Cookie Monster croons his big hit C Is For Cookie, clap along as Grover sings Fuzzy And Blue and What Do I Do When I'm Alone. Get some more monster in you.",1018742400,6,303,3.903225806451613
786553,4,6304132654,"It took our 2 year old a little while to get into this video, but now that he has, he asks for it every night ""Onster Hits"".
As a parent, it's nice to see characters that I grew up including Grover, Herry, Cookie Monster which don't seem to appear much in the current Sesame Street shows.
There are quite a few monster in this video that I hadn't seen, nor have I seen since, although Frazzle is great.
I'd definitely recommend buying this video.  You just may have to view it two or three times for you and your kid(s) to get into it.",1000166400,8,535,4.144230769230769

7862264,4,6304132654,My two-year-old daughter loves this program. I am more of a country music girl so it's a little less appealing to me than some of the other Sesame Street shows. Many of the songs have been rewritten from the original hits to include some sort of educational concept.
