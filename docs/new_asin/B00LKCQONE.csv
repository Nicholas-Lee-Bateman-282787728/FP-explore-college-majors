6488788,4,B00LKCQONE,Nice.,1414454400,,5,5.0
6488789,2,B00LKCQONE,I was disappointed by the poor acting in the film and the lack of substance in the story.  I wanted to see how God played a greater role in giving us grace and how devastated we can be when tragedy strikes.  It seemed a little too passive in dealing with real life situations.  As seen in many other stories when the big specialty stores set up in town it doesn't seem real that little stores can continue to exist unless they sell something that the larger stores don't so it didn't seem authentic to me.,1414368000,2,505,4.294736842105263
6488790,5,B00LKCQONE,"Love this great family movie.  There are too few ""quality movies such as this around"".  I look forward to another Perna movie!",1414281600,11,126,4.681818181818182
6488791,5,B00LKCQONE,"I bought this movie and  it is very well done it,s been a long time since I have seen a Christmas movie that talks about god. The actors did an awesome job . I would recommend this movie to anyone. This is a Christmas movie to add to your collection. This movie is the true meaning of Christmas.",1414108800,26,295,4.086206896551724
6488792,5,B00LKCQONE,"I was stunned to see such a wonderful family oriented movie.  In fact, I ordered two DVDs.  One for myself and one for a family member.  The message is so important that I will order another DVD and give it to my local library so that many other people can see it for free.  What a pleasure to view a movie that does NOT use sex, vulgar language or violence to entertain the viewing audience.  Most movies today shy away from personal relationships that stress integrity and kindness to our fellow human beings.  Highly recommend this movie to all age groups, you will NOT be disappointed.  I am so glad I found this Godly movie on Amazon.",1413676800,72,639,4.410256410256411
6488793,5,B00LKCQONE,love it,1413158400,2,7,3.0
6488794,5,B00LKCQONE,"I love a Christmas story that follows the Bible.  It was beautifully played,",1412985600,27,76,4.846153846153846
6488795,5,B00LKCQONE,Very good family movie for the holidays.  It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy.,1412812800,19,88,4.176470588235294
6488796,5,B00LKCQONE,This is a great family oriented film.,1412812800,2,37,4.428571428571429
6488807,5,B00LKCQONE,Would give 6 stars if possible.  Shows grace of God and really shows how Jesus Christ makes a difference in people's lives.  Also great if you are hurting or if someone is hurting you.  Gives new perspective on handling bullies and mean people.,1515110400,,244,4.627906976744186
6488808,1,B00LKCQONE,Super bad acting; horrible,1515110400,,26,5.75
6488809,5,B00LKCQONE,We love this movie! Great for the whole family! Its very clean and wholesome! Beautiful message too!,1514851200,,100,4.9411764705882355
6488810,3,B00LKCQONE,"Good for families with young children.  Very hard to get past the horrible dialogue and bland acting, but if you REALLY want a spiritual message that is strong and unapologetic, you'll like this movie by the end.  The overall plot points really aren't that bad.",1514764800,,261,4.777777777777778
6488811,5,B00LKCQONE,"It was refreshing to see a clear presentation of the grace of God to sinners. God's grace can be received by even the worst sinner, such as Mr Tollman in the story, who repents of his sins and turns to Christ as Lord and Savior.",1514764800,,228,4.088888888888889
6488812,5,B00LKCQONE,"The message in this movie is absolutely awesome! Yes, it's true that there is room for improvement as far as acting goes, but please look pass that because this movie is a hidden gem. Must see!!!",1514764800,,195,4.444444444444445
6488813,1,B00LKCQONE,"This movie was so incredibly bad.  I would give zero stars if that is possible. A star is too nice. A poop emoji might be a better representation. I am actually surprised that Amazon allows it to be on Prime because it is so bad. I can't believe that someone paid to produce it. I think it might just be like a rich preacher's son or something that made it to show in Bible study classes or something. I mean it is soooooo bad. I only continued watching it to see how much worse it could get. And it didn't disappoint, the acting and staged conversations about religious crap just get worse and worse throughout. The acting is so bad, it is almost like they are reading off of a play in an English class in high school where no one wants to be reading it. Wow. Bad!",1514592000,,765,4.168918918918919
6488814,2,B00LKCQONE,"Obviously low budget, bad acting, and not a good script and somewhat of an attempt at trying to evangelize. I let the movie play just to see how it would proceed, which is as thought it would as it was very predictable.",1514592000,,219,4.238095238095238
6488815,5,B00LKCQONE,Great message!!!,1514505600,,16,7.5

6488827,2,B00LKCQONE,"I truly tried to watch it, gave it 30 minutes but couldn't continue. I don't care what the story line is, it has to be watchable.",1514332800,,129,4.0
6488828,3,B00LKCQONE,"It's a Christmas movie with sub-par acting, but a good story line/lesson. However, the way in which the topic is approached screams religion and God, so be prepared! The messaging was pretty forced towards the end and not subtle at all.",1514246400,,236,4.780487804878049
6488829,5,B00LKCQONE,Acting  very good  great plot,1514160000,,29,4.6
6488830,5,B00LKCQONE,"This movie is so good, it was made in the future. Living future right here. It's Futorial Fiction, set in 2025. Aside from the plot and story, 10/10 I'd highly recommend--really a great look into the future.",1513987200,,207,4.621621621621622
6488831,5,B00LKCQONE,This is the fifth Christmas movie I have seen in the past few days. This movie gets to the heart of Christmas! Most of the others just fool around.,1513987200,,147,4.103448275862069
6488832,5,B00LKCQONE,I enjoyed this movie and so did my kids!,1513987200,,40,3.5555555555555554
6488833,4,B00LKCQONE,This is a low budget film with a simple story line. However it definitely captures the impact of a Christian who follows God without regard for their own well being.,1513900800,,165,4.533333333333333
6488834,5,B00LKCQONE,"Great movie! Christmas is about celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus (Yeshua). Even though the real birth day isn't on the 25th, but it is a reminder that God the Father loves us all.  He created all things.  It's a reminder of Love and Grace that God has given to all man kind.  Without love and death on the cross mankind will always be blinded.  Regardless of the negatives on all other reviews, those who don't understand the true meaning of Christmas still celebrate Christmas, but why?  So, why do people celebrate Christmas if they don't know the true meaning.  Because blindness and not knowing the truth lead to ignorance just like the actor in the movie.  Those who don't know the truth will never understand because they do not search for the truth about kindness, giving and loving others.  Blinded by the commercialism millions of people don't know why they celebrate Christmas.  The movie gave a good example of God's grace and love.",1513728000,3,950,4.709090909090909
6488835,1,B00LKCQONE,"Acting is abysmal, sounds like robots are reading from a script and plot is nearly as bland. I nearly vomited several times just having this on in the background, so fair warning if you try to actually watch it. The entire point of the movie is to try to force religion down your throat. I'm all about religion being an important part of Christmas, but this is just a horrible movie.",1513641600,,383,4.408450704225352
6488836,1,B00LKCQONE,horrible only watched 4.3 min,1513555200,,29,5.0
6488847,5,B00LKCQONE,"Did a good job of showing the truth of Christmas. It is a low budget movie, but I enjoyed the story.",1513555200,,100,3.8095238095238093
6488848,1,B00LKCQONE,"The ""in your face"" Christian references, ""God this .... God that ..."" way too much. Real people don't talk like that ... unless it's an ""in your face"" Christian movie ... ugh. Spiritual messages should come through subliminally with actions, not words. Yet, in this case, the bad acting wouldn't make a difference. I couldn't watch the rest of it. Obviously, Mr. Grinch (the other toy store owner) gets it in the end, whether it's a warm fuzzy, a feel good moment, understanding what it means to be good to others, yadda, or other. For now, I don't care. Don't waste your time. See ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" cartoon or movie for the same message, which is way better than this nonsense.",1513555200,2,693,4.642276422764228
6488849,4,B00LKCQONE,"A blessing that brought tears to my eyes! The storyline is all about the undeniable difference Jesus makes in a life. If you'e ever been unfairly ruined but trusted God anyway, you'll love this movie.
Filmed outside Detroit, the cinematography is excellent and the music is perfect; the actors are clearly amateur but it was a fine performance nonetheless.",1513555200,2,356,5.0508474576271185
6488850,3,B00LKCQONE,"I saw at the end that this movie used kickstarter to be made but this pretty much is a typical Hallmark type feel good movie. The music is even the kind you'd hear in a Hallmark movie. The over all story is up lifting & it has a tidy ending. The things that kept me from rating it higher were:
1) The continuity was glaringly off. A person went inside during the day & sent out and it was night...the daylight/night time shots were really muddled a good bit.
2) Across the board the acting was sincere, but not very high quality.
(On a scale of A-F ;if Ben Kingsley & David Suchet  are A grade, these actors would be  C grade)
Some people may not like the very obvious Christian characters, but it is part of the story. (Example: it's a Christian moral : forgive & do good to your enemy)
Overall I didn't hate the movie & it was very uplifting",1513468800,,843,4.1656441717791415
6488851,2,B00LKCQONE,"Good message as a Christian, but too pat and the acting was so bad it took me two days to get through it.  Very boring.",1513468800,,119,3.76
6488852,5,B00LKCQONE,Sound doctrine in a nice story. Great way to wrap up a busy happy Christmas celebration with family.,1513468800,,100,4.611111111111111
6488853,5,B00LKCQONE,Great storyline!,1513468800,,16,7.5
6488854,5,B00LKCQONE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  This kind of movie is what we need more of.  I only read one of the negative reviews, and that's all I needed to read. I wasn't going to let it get me down.  Let them say  what they want, it doesn't matter. Whether it was a low budget movie or not, it was the message it told.  That's what was important.  God bless everyone this Christmas season.",1513468800,2,380,4.136986301369863
6488855,1,B00LKCQONE,"Bad Acting, es muy horrible",1513382400,,27,4.6
6488856,2,B00LKCQONE,Full disclaimer--- I didn't finish the movie.  I'm guessing the plot/themes end up being all well and good.  The acting is just too bad to make it through.  Wooden across the board.,1513382400,,181,4.59375
6488876,1,B00LKCQONE,Not good.,1513296000,,9,4.0
6488877,5,B00LKCQONE,heartwarming!!!,1513296000,,15,15.0
6488878,5,B00LKCQONE,"It was a classic christmas movie with the moral of the story to trust in god, and accept Jesus as our savior.",1513209600,,109,4.0
6488879,4,B00LKCQONE,"The only reason I'm writing this review is because I couldn't believe all the 1 star reviews on IMDB, there's a ton of them and it's because
of the religious overtones in this film, that being said this is a very enjoyable movie about 2 toy stores, the newer one bigger and with many
more items and cheaper, yes it has many christian references but that's part of the story line and if you don't like it pop It's a Wonderful Life
or Scrooge into the DVD player.",1513123200,3,461,4.25
6488880,5,B00LKCQONE,Great movie for all ages!,1513036800,,25,4.2
6488881,3,B00LKCQONE,A little brash on the Christian recruitment and acting is not nuanced but the story is strong enough to make it enjoyable.,1513036800,,122,4.590909090909091
6488882,4,B00LKCQONE,"The acting was at times amateur, like a high school production, but so what.  The message was compelling (if not obviously baptist).  As a Catholic, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and message, but remember that there is more to achieving salvation than a one time act of being ""saved"".  It is a life long journey to achieve grace.",1512950400,,330,4.655172413793103
6488883,1,B00LKCQONE,I got about 15 minutes into it and had to turn it off.  The acting was absolutely horrendous.  The only reason this is getting good reviews is because it's a Christian movie and people are rating it for that reason and not for the actual production value.,1512777600,,255,4.404255319148936
6488884,1,B00LKCQONE,A poorly written and acted Christian based movie.  I am amazed it received the high rankings it did.  It is one of the worst movies I have every watched in reference to the writing and acting.,1512691200,2,192,4.305555555555555

6488897,5,B00LKCQONE,AWESOME Family Movie it really Shows Gods Love For others and how he uses us to do great things and to help people. find Him though his son Jesus Christ. it also really focus on loving your enemies and with that  love you will show them Jesus Christ.,1512432000,,250,4.208333333333333

6488904,4,B00LKCQONE,Moving Christian message.  Good Christmas movie that isn't a romance and good for the kids.  Simple production but good story of how love can change a person.,1511740800,,158,4.814814814814815

6488917,2,B00LKCQONE,I haven't found anything mentioning that this is a pushing the Christian view of God on viewers.  That is not what I want to watch.,1511568000,,131,4.24
6488918,5,B00LKCQONE,I loved the movie. Any movie that shares this kind of storyline and uses the name of Jesus is more than worth watching for me.,1511568000,,126,4.08

6488938,1,B00LKCQONE,"I have attempted to watch this movie twice, on Amazon prime. I found it to amateurish and overtly christian trite. A little christian platitudes goes a long way. The owner of Gary's toy store was meek, mild and turn the other cheek. The competitor was overly mean, nasty and ruthless. I love uplifting and inspiring movies. I like to see faith and hope without the christian bible thumping smugness. I stopped the movie after 12 minutes, because I could not take any more the poor acting and predictable plot.",1510444800,,509,4.730337078651686

The concept of treating others with kindness and love despite their rude, angry behavior is central to the theme.  I don't think the acting or the editing of the movie meets today's standards (for example, in the Hallmark Christmas movies), but I still think that some of the characters particularly were sincere and surprisingly real in a way.  I haven't seen any other videos that deal so directly with bringing God's love into contemporary story, and I think many people would be touched by that.

6489318,3,B00LKCQONE,"We were looking for a good holiday themed movie to watch as a family and chose this one based on the fact it looked wholesome and seemed to focus on delivering a positive message. We also tend to like independent films. While the boys and I enjoyed it and it was indeed a wholesome movie, it did overdo the religious piece of the movie. We all felt like we were at church and being lectured to.  It quite frankly became almost comical and off-putting at times and detracted from the quality of the movie. We all thought the message could have been delivered in a more subtle way without all of the preachiness. That being said, the message was a good one for everyone in all walks of life and the tone was uplifting. The acting left a bit to be desired but the character development was good.  I would recommend this movie to the religious community and those not religious providing they can tolerate regular sermons throughout. It was quite apparant this was a low budget film; however, I think they did a great job with what they had to work with.",1482796800,5,1050,4.435233160621761

6489499,3,B00LKCQONE,"This would have earned 2 stars or even 1, if it didn't have such a good message. There are few films that portray Christ's command to ""love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you"" (Matthew 5:44). Even though the filming was terrible, the production was awful (with the exception of the Treasure Ball game, that was pretty cool), and the acting was worse than I had seen outside a high school play in the last 5 years, the message still came through powerfully enough to warm the heart.

My wife picked this; she and my teenage daughter left the movie halfway through; they said they couldn't stand it any longer. They urged me to turn it off, but I told them, ""There's a certain pleasure in watching movies that are so bad they're good."" My two sons and I stayed through the end (their choice; they could have just gone to bed too). I wanted to see how it ended, and I wasn't disappointed.",1482278400,2,976,4.392265193370166

6489520,4,B00LKCQONE,"This movie touched me more than I was expecting. The acting is certainly not Oscar-worthy, but it was strong enough to hold up the simple, strong plot of the movie. The plot itself moved along nicely and didn't seem to drag. I love how this movie went straight to the heart of the issue, and didn't dance around spirituality and the name of Jesus. The Christian messages were strong, but not sappy. The message the movie sends is actually strong enough to gently challenge believers, and maybe, hopefully, instill some hope in non-believers.

I'd love to see more movies from this director/writer. My only serious critique would be this: although your lead characters are pleasant, the Christians in the film are a little too squeaky-clean, and therefore come across as not-so realistic. Don't be afraid to write in the flaws; the Lord knows we all have them! One of the amazing things about Christianity is that we have a Saviour who loves us DESPITE of our flaws, not because we  are flawless.

This one is definitely worth a watch!",1482278400,,1034,4.76536312849162

6489733,1,B00LKCQONE,"This is a totally hilarious film. It's a turn the other cheek movie that explains how christians believe that if you make fist-fulls of money it means that God is on your side. All of his plans are about opening windows so that you can get richer. So, the christian who turns the other cheek is rewarded by, what?, MONEY! And his loving act is to take over the competitor's business in a seemingly loving way by loving brotherly love and what is brotherly love: more money! Without the money there was no redemption. It's the most greedy, capitalist plot you could ever find and encourages middle class people to give even more money to corporate conglomerates who treat their lower class employees poorly. How stupid is it possible to be?  Pretty stupid. Also, the acting is drop dead bad (the only reason the film is slightly enjoyable to watch).",1481760000,,848,4.653333333333333

Christmas is my favorite season so, this year, I'll be asking Santa for better actors and directors in future Christmas movies.  It's pretty much a PG-rated B film.

The flimsy, transparent script is riddled with clichs and sappy sentimentality. The theology is at about a kindergarten level, the plot is thin, the characters absolutely stereotyped, and the acting unnaturally sweet with an extra overtone of saccharine.

Some of the great art through the centuries in every medium has told the Christian story. This movie is the opposite of great art. If I were a non-Christian looking at it, I'd laugh it off and be embarrassed for the people who produced it. I imagine the filmmakers were trying to evangelize.

6489925,5,B00LKCQONE,"Keith Perna has accomplished a Christmas miracle in his directorial debut. ""Christmas Grace"" presents an incredible story of loss and redemption at the holidays. One cannot finish this movie without a deep sense of wonder at Gary the toy store owner, brilliantly portrayed by Ryan-Iver Klann. We all remember Klann from his unforgettable role as a tetherball player in the 2010 blockbuster ""Tetherball: The Movie."" Here he finally gets the part he was born to play: a kindly toy store owner whose livelihood is threatened by the malevolent Mr. Tollman, played with pathological precision by the incomparable Tim Kaiser, who brought new life to an aging franchise as Admiral Gardner in ""Star Trek: Horizon."" Move over Ebenezer Scrooge; a new Christmas villain has been born. Buttressing the all-star cast with a performance ranging from pathos to exultation as Gary's wife Michelle, Rebekah Cook delivers as matriarch of the underdog toy purveyor's family.

Samuel Joshua has assembled a musical score worthy of Max Steiner's classic work at Warner Brothers. The music plunges the viewer into the abyss of despair as Gary faces the conniving Mr. Tollman, only to bring forth the joy of redemption. Not since Bernard Herrmann's haunting score for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960) have we seem such a meaningful score.

Filmed on site in suburban Detroit, ""Christmas Grace"" delivers a heartwarming story of love conquering greed at Christmas. Joy to the world; a classic is born!",1480377600,,1478,5.232067510548523

6489949,4,B00LKCQONE,"I simply cannot watch a season of Christmas movies without first reaching into a good faith-based film. Well, my hopes are that it will be good. Christmas Grace did not disappoint. It starts out with a perfect small town setting. There is snow on sidewalks and a light hustle and bustle is captured. And then there is the toy shop. I tell you, I was ready to dive right in. There is just something about small towns and the suggestion of a tight community that warms the heart and opens the mind to dreaming. I am won over every single time.

We meet Gary the owner of a the small toy store. The store isn't bustling but it looks like the kind of place where you could find something unique and share a little news with Gary. And news is shared by a friend...a gigantic toy store is opening up across the street and it doesn't look good for Gary. Gary is not overly concerned. He believes God has everything in control and has an attitude of there is plenty of room for everyone. Obviously things are not going to work out so simply.

What I liked: I loved that Christmas Grace is filled with a cast of...how can I put this? Normal people. If you are in a small town, you are going to see and interact with individuals much like those you see and encounter in Christmas Grace. It drew me in far more than seeing another typical Christmas movie cast and by typical I mean the same stars in the same roles that are just slightly recycled. With Christmas Grace, everyone grows on you if you are willing to let them. I liked that Gary kept his trust in the Lord and was encouraging to others. There were key points in the film that had a nice impact on me and even my husband.

What I would have liked to see tweaked: The acting could be a little off and wooden at times.  I read some reviews that really blamed the actors for anything negative about the film, and I have to disagree with that. This film and its underlying message is not ruined even when the acting is not top notch. I think that the writing could have been tweaked a little bit so people might have spoke a little more naturally, but none of that took away from the film for me. The timeline also could be a little hard to follow, but again none of these things made me dismiss the film nor become impatient with it. I looked for and found the gold in the story.

Last note - I did not purchase Christmas Grace. I watched it via streaming and I hope Amazon streams more like it. If you are looking for a sweet Christmas story to get you in the mood for the season, definitely check out Christmas Grace. If you are offended by the mention of God in a Christmas movie...don't see it. If you are over critical of acting or semi-corny story lines...I really don't know why you see Christmas films anyway, because aren't they all a little predictable?",1479600000,,2811,4.296226415094339
6489950,2,B00LKCQONE,"This movie needs better actors. I really tried to like it, but I only made it through the first 30 minutes. The whole cast was lacking in acting skills.  Family and sappy movies like this are what I enjoy watching this time of year!",1479600000,,232,4.2727272727272725

6490130,1,B00LKCQONE,"Christmas Grace tells the story of two rival toy store owners competing
for business over several Christmas seasons. One of them is Gary
(RyanIver Klann), a young toy store owner who runs an honest business
and who tries to maintain a good reputation with his customers. Things
are running smoothly for Gary until his business is threatened when a
much larger toy company moves to the neighborhood. The owner of this
larger company, Mr. Tollman (Tim Kaiser), is a ruthless businessman who
voraciously wants to grow his business and eliminate competition. Since
his most immediate competition is Gary's store, he sets his target on
him. As the story unfolds, it becomes very clear that God is at work in
the lives of these two men, and God's grace and providence work out in
ways neither of them could have imagined.

There is nothing professional about this film. Its bad. It slow moving
& anti climatic. Its also too preachy. I don't mind a religious message
but they do hit you over the head with it every 2 minutes. This film is
not worth your time.",1472601600,4,1052,4.686486486486486

The film was very, very religious which I didn't know before starting it. Usually Santa or angels, or some kind person is the focused change maker, but for this film, religion, God, and faith play this role.

I wish there was more closure to details that transpire during the film rather than just the main conflict.

All in all, not bad. Probably more like 3.5 stars, whereas hallmark and lifetime Christmas movies for me are like 4.5 to 5 stars.",1460332800,,578,4.495238095238095

6490161,2,B00LKCQONE,"It is sad that by virtue of the fact this is a Christian film - overtly so - poor production values and acting are not only accepted but lauded.  Christians seem so hungry for representation, they will accept poor casting, acting and scripting and make a huge positive review response simply because accepting ""Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior"" is mentioned.  The same can not be said for countless films depicting Muslim or Hindu life, for example.  Christmas films are generally mediocre fare and this one definitely so.  I cannot possibly award more stars in good conscious for the simple fact it is a ""Christian"" film.  There are plenty of secular films out there depicting a practicing Christian life without all of the bible thumping fanfare.",1449273600,,752,4.889763779527559

Normally I love Christmas movies, even the silly cheesy ones, but I can't recommend this one. The cover was beautiful; that was the nicest thing I can say.",1445385600,6,481,4.540229885057471

6490172,5,B00LKCQONE,"Christmas GRACE is the best Christmas movie, that I have ever seen!

The music, photography are excellent and the performers are wonderful!

Keith Perna, please make more movies like Christmas Grace! Please make all your movies, so they are rated NR, and God honoring, like this one!

Please make some Easter and Thanksgiving themed movies. I know that thousands, besides myself, are starving for films, that tell the reasons for the seasons. I pray that you are richly rewarded for this!

Movie searchers,

If you want a Christmas movie, that will melt your heart and bring you joy and hope, please buy this movie.

If you want to bless others, like another reviewer mentioned, buy more copies and give these for Christmas gifts! God Bless You!",1438905600,,745,4.873015873015873

6490195,4,B00LKCQONE,"This is not a bad movie though, as others have pointed out, the acting is not of the highest calibre.  But it isn't really bad, a little amateurish, but not enough to keep me from watching.

And I rather liked it.  It is the story of a young couple who run a toy store in a small town -- the wife is very pregnant, but the store is doing well -- not a surprise because the couple are nice, friendly and helpful.  They are not doing so well once a bigger toy store moves across the street.  The new owner is not nice, friendly, or helpful -- in fact you might think that the devil has been his idol.  Gary the owner of Gary's toys is not only religious, he believes that just about everything is a sign from God, even when he goes out of business.

His fortunes do change and he goes back into the toy business but takes that as a sign that he should help his rival stay in business.  Yes, this is very much a Christian-oriented movie with a strong message and that is how the writer/director planned it all along.

It is not my favorite Christmas movie, but it is interesting and I did find it very different and likable.  It was certainly a heartfelt movie for all those involved.",1421020800,2,1181,4.185840707964601
6490196,4,B00LKCQONE,"I enjoyed this movie.  This story shows how events can occur that seem overwhelming or disastrous, but all works out in a way that everyone learns from.

I really wanted to like it, but it was painful to watch.  I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it was ""clean"" family fare, but I would only recommend it for an old person who has nothing better to do.
