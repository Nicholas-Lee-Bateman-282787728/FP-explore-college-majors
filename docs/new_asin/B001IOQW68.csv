3649531,4,B001IOQW68,"When calibrating softcore movies, one has to use a different yardstick to review and rate them. That yardstick has to be adjusted again when evaluating American vs. European vs. Asian softcore (I personally prefer the Euro ones). The unstated but ultimate purpose of these flix is not only to entertain but to stimulate the viewer, and the best do both. But there are very few that succeed. If you don't believe this, I envy your navet. If you think you're gonna mine gold in this arena, you're being foolish.

  Here's the skinny on this Asian soft-core horror flick - it's not as good as 'Onechanbara', 'Machine Girl', 'Tokyo Zombie', 'Stacy', 'Meatball Machine', or 'Tokyo Gore Police' as far as solid, campy horror goes. It's at least as good as 'Zombie Hunter Rika', 'Captive Factory Girls' (both 1 and 2), 'Maid-Droid', 'Sexy Battle Girls', or 'Cruel Restaurant' as far as action/horror flix go. And it's WAY better than 'Female Prisoner Sigma', 'Yo-Yo Girl Sexy Cop', 'Sars Wars', 'Maid`s Secret' (both 1 and 2), 'Ninja Vixens', 'Kekko Kamen', 'Lady Ninja Kasumi' (1 through 4), or any of the 'Lady Ninja Kaeda' flix.

  These last ones are ALL soft-core, and most pretty much suck on a variety of levels. This film is ridiculous, sure, but it's good for more than a few laughs and has copious amounts of nudity to keep me away from late-nite Ron Jeremy flix on satellite, so there's something to be grateful for right there...",1273276800,4,1434,4.808943089430894
3649532,2,B001IOQW68,"Many countries have tried to test adult video with an actual storyline.  One film would be equivalent to an X-rated film and another minus the hardcore sex scenes and thus gets an equivalent R-rating.  In Japan, the film known as ""Joshikyoei Hanrangun"" aka ""Attack Girls Swim Team versus the Undead"" (or Nihombie 2), is a softcore horror film directed by Koji Kawano (""Kyoshujo no Oneesan 2', ""Love My Life"" and ""Cruel Restaurant"") and a screenplay by Satoshi Owada (""Cruel Restaurant"") and features Japanese adult video stars Sasa Handa and Yuria Hidaka.

The film revolves around a new student in high school named Aki (Sasa Handa).  We hear various warnings of a virus in the area and all students and teachers must have a virus shot.  Unfortunately, the girls swim team is too busy with their upcoming meet and don't get the shot.  Meanwhile, a girl named  Sayaka (Yuria Hidaka) pushes Aki who is looking at the pool into the water and she realizes that Aki is not a member of the swim team.  She eventual becomes friends with her quite quickly as the two take a shower together and Aki sees that she has a certain mark on her breast that she has.

While Aki is laying on top of the roof at her school, she is greet by Sayaka once again and notices the same birthmark on the side of her neck that she has.  Needless to say, the two quickly become friends (despite the other classmates thinking Aki is spooky because she never talks to anyone).

By this time, the school has changed for the worst as everyone who has received the flu shot are now turning to zombies.  In one class, a teacher uses his rulers as a weapon, chopping students up, while other students start eating each other.

Needless to say, the teachers and schools gone made but the swim team happens to be OK?  How come they are unaffected?  With the school now infested with zombies, will the girls swim team survive around the undead?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Attack Girls' Swim Team versus The Undead"" is presented in 16:9.  Its evident that the film was shot digitally, so it has that clean grainless look. For the most part, the film is shot inside a school, inside a classroom or swimming pool area and outside the school.  Very few scene locations but for this type of film, it's not really needed.

As for audio, audio is in Japanese via 2.0 and English subtitles.  For audio setting, I had my receiver settings with stereo on all channels but for the most part, the film is front-channel driven.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features on the DVD, nor is their a menu.  So, expect the film to begin right after you insert the DVD inside your player.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Attack Girls' Swim Team Versus the Undead: Unrated Limited Edition"" is marketed as a gorehouse pulp horror film and the cover with Japanese girls with weapons definitely will catch one's attention.  But the film is not to be looked at as a ""horror"" film per se, possibly a watered down porno without the hardcore sex scenes but with a wacky ""Resident Evil"" meets ""Dead Rising"" but at a girl's school type of storyline.

The film would definitely appeal to the Japanophiles or the curious horror fan but for the hardcore horror fans, you're not going to exactly get those visually sickening scenes.  Even I have my limits to horror films but this film, was difficult to get scared because in one scene, you'll see the main talent nude and then it cuts to a horror scene.  Sure, you get severed limbs and hardcore blood splatters all over the place but they look so low-budget that it becomes almost like comedy than horror.

And for those who are used to schlocky zombie films, ""Attack Girls' Swim Team Versus the Undead"" maybe schlocky, especially when you find out what can make a zombie revert back to human but where zombie films focus a lot on the carnage, needless to say, this film probably leans less towards carnage and more to possibly getting the audience aroused.  I can see Japanese adult video fans wondering how far both Japanese porn stars Sasa Handa and Yuria Hidaka will go in this film and although this is an unrated film, let's just say that Sasa Handa is probably not acting during those sexual scenes.  In fact, it made me wonder if this film was similar to ""Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge"" which also features adult video stars in a more story-driven film, but in ""Pirates II"", that film was released in two formats (X-rated and R-rated).  I have no idea if there is an X-rated version of this film but I wouldn't be surprised if there was.

Overall, the film is laughable, low-budget horror fare but then again, this film was not exactly created to win awards for cinematography or best screenplay, this film was created to bridge the gap for those who enjoy horror, zombie and softcore films and eventually brought overseas (and possibly a smart way for the Japanese to promote their AV stars outside of Japan).  You literally get a mix of all three in ""Attack Girls' Swim Team Versus the Undead"".

For hentai anime fans, yes you get the fan service ala pantie shots and even a sexy beam that is shot from Aki's vajajay, what more can you ask for?  If anything, the weakest part about this DVD release is that there are no DVD menu and no special features and of course, the storyline and acting is not exactly something to rave about. And this is a low-budget film, so you're not going to get a 5.1 soundtrack or awesome picture quality.

I'm sure there is a segment of movie fans who don't mind being aroused without the hardcore sex scenes and I know there are plenty of people who dig these style of Japanese horror/softcore films, so if you are one of those fans, then this ""Attack Girls' Swim Team Versus the Undead: Unrated Limited Edition"" is definitely for you!",1254355200,3,5747,4.586105675146771

Luckily the girls swim team is unaffected and they must fight for their survival against the undead student bodies and a mad scientist that's running it all.

3649534,1,B001IOQW68,"First and foremost, this movie is atrocious.  Some of it feels like a really bad after school special with a bad budget.  Other aspects reminded me of the kind of R-Rated soap opera that gets cancelled after one episode.

Essentially it's a movie about a school infected and overrun by zombies.  Some girls have sores on their sweater kittens.  One girl has a completely idiotic history of abuse and flute music hypnotism.  Along with the abused, the only girls immune to the infection are those on the swim team, because of the pool's chemicals.  A fight for survival and the school ensues (as if the zombies stood a chance against a girl with a crotch-laser).

The highlights, if they can be called that, are all about exploitation and absolutely horrible production value.  It's the side-melon shot, the up-skirt, the unnecessary shower scene, faux-lesbianism, and the voyeuristic close-ups of butt cheeks that peek outside of tight panties underneath schoolgirl outfits (when they're not in swimsuits).  The exploitation factor is through the roof in this one, and it there is no doubt that those who made this are the same crowd who have fueled the most bizarre videos that have come out of Japan (you know which ones I'm talking about).  As for the production value, it may be the worst in any movie I've ever seen.  The acting is atrocious in any language.  The gore is so hokey that it's insulting.  Everything else is pathetic.

Aside from the zombie teacher who juggles rulers and uses them like kitanas, and the female teacher who speaks in hilarious Engrish (both are unintentionally funny), the only thing this movie has going for it is naked Japanese chicks engaging in gratuitous soft-core action (which is probably why most people watch this in the first place).",1245715200,,1778,4.88

Good film for the just into puberty crown with hormones that react to anything, but as a zombie film for anyone past age 17-18 I don't think you'll watch it again, or want to.  Even the lazer hidden up the heroine's wazzoo that she fries the bad guy with at the end was NOT an issue of saving grace for the film.  DO NOT BE IMPRESSED (see, that did not work, did it?) with all-caps exclamations of how great this film is.  Methinks they dost protest too much in advance.

3649537,4,B001IOQW68,"Attack Girls Swim Team vs. the Undead (Koji Kawano, 2007)

Okay, let's start off by saying that if you're the kind of person who sees a title like Attack Girls Swim Team vs. the Undead and does not immediately think ""THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER"", you're probably in the wrong place. Because that's exactly what I thought when I saw the title of this movie, and, well, I'm the guy who's writing the review. If we're coming from entirely different mindsets... you know. And while the movie doesn't live up to the promise of the title, it's certainly good for a romp.

Aki (Sasa Handa) is the new girl at school. Keeps to herself, quiet, that sort of thing. One day, Sayaka (Yuria Hidaka), seeing her at the side of the pool and mistaking her for someone else, pushes her in as a prank. The two of them become fast friends after that, but this is no simple friendship drama. Because, after all, there must be an evil mastermind experimenting on the school (where else but in Japan?), administering a ""vaccine"" for a cold that's going around. But, yeah, vaccine? It makes zombies of everyone but Aki and the girls' swim team, who must find a cure.

No, it's not a great movie, and most of the time it's not even a good movie. But on the Joe Bob Briggs blood, breasts, and beasts scale, it gets top marks in all three categories (including one scene between Handa and Hidaka that wouldn't be out of place in an Emmanuelle flick), and it adds a continual element of just plan weird, in that style the Japanese do so well. The climax of the movie is just jaw-dropping. I mean, really, off-the-scale, [censored for Amazon consumption] nuts. And hysterically funny, if that kind of humor works for you.

So, yeah, not a good movie, but it's the kind of bad movie that transcends its badness and becomes something great. This is one you owe it to yourself to watch. ****",1233964800,15,1860,4.477876106194691
3649538,2,B001IOQW68,"Ok, every now and then we see a movie so outrageously silly, so sleazy, full of exploitive scenes and so trashy that you wonder as to why you would waste your time watching it and how you managed to sit through the whole thing. I saw ""The Girls REBEL FORCE of Competitive Swimmers"" (aka. Joshikyoei hanrangun, Attack Girls' Swim Team vs. The Undead) earlier this year, and honestly, I feel so guilty that I managed to sit through the film. Well, I have a weakness for zombies and I have to prove that I am no snob. Hey, The film does feature hot Japanese girls in swimsuits and they're often seen in their birthday suits.

Aki (Sasa Handa) is a student with a troubled past. She was kept prisoner and abused by an enigmatic professor and trained to be an assassin. She had just transferred to a school at the worst possible time. There's a mysterious virus in the school and students and teachers are being rounded up to receive a vaccine to counter the virus. However, the very same vaccine supposed to protect them from infection is actually a drug that turns everyone to flesh-eating zombies. Luckily, Aki skipped on the vaccine, and the swim team is immune to the virus because of the chemicals present in the school's swimming pool--chlorine. Aki finds out that the man responsible for the injections is the same man who sexually abused and kept her prisoner.

I was expecting a film much like ""Wild Zero"", ""Sars Wars: Bangkok Zombie Crisis"", and ""Meatball Machine"" when I put the DVD in the player. The film is pretty bad, but I have to admit I couldn't help snickering and giggling while I was watching it. The film is somewhat entertaining in a ""guilty"" type of way (or maybe I have bad taste?). The film really seemed like director Koji Kawano and the rest of the film crew were writing the film as they went along and drinking a lot of sake while shooting it. The fight scenes are laughable, the ""special effects"" are a far cry from being ""special"", the plot is so silly and it is so dumb that the script doesn't make sense at all.

So why the heck did I waste my time watching it??

The film does find some originality when it comes to sheer campiness. A swim team that takes on zombies sure is original. The girls aren't as hot as those in ""OneChanbara"" but they are quite sexy in their own way. It's a wonder that they had to change to swimsuits before they go into battle. There's an abundance of female nudity and softcore sex scenes--there's even girl-on-girl action. There is blood and gore when a teacher uses a ruler to chop off limbs and heads. There is a zombie lunch buffet. I will tell you the film's most outrageous scene: a laser beam is shot from the lead actress's crotch area!! The actresses knew what exactly they signed up for in this film--count on the Japanese to make a film that counts on pure exploitation, panty shots, sex scenes and a lot of female nudity to put audiences in the seats.

The film does not make any bit of sense and to be honest, I feel quite hypocritical if I said I didn't enjoy trashy films--but I really don't. But how come I know this film is indeed bad but never for a moment did I feel bored in its entirety? The film's sex scenes are unarrousing but I have a hard time telling the difference between erotic and dull--because the film doesn`t make any sense. The rape scene feels forced and the acting is really bad. I have to say that the low-budget blood and gore is appealing. Plus, nothing is as outrageous as a ""crotch laser beam"". ""Attack Girls` Swim Team vs. the Undead"" is DEFINITELY NOT for everyone. If any of my descriptions sound appealing to you, then go ahead and give the movie a spin--just don't say I didn't warn you. The film is a hoot!

Rent it! But recommended to fans of Japanese trashy exploitation and wacky films. [2  Stars]

8311241,4,B001IOQW68,"An inoculation that's supposed to prevent a virus that's going around the school turns those that get it into flesh-eating zombies. However, the members of the swim team aren't affected and it's later discovered that the chlorine in the pool seems to make them immune to the effects of the tainted vaccine. So, we have the swim team vs. the undead.

Sasa Handa (known during her non-AV days as ""Chieri Haruyama"") plays Aki Kitashima, a new student with a mysterious background who possess the skills to fight the undead. If the character was written as being emotionless and wooden, then Sasa played this one to the T. However, I believe it's safe to say that Sasa was cast in this role for at least two reasons other than her acting abilities, or lack of. Yuria Hidaka plays Sayaka, who assumes leadership of the swim team after they lose their captain. She gives Aki a very warm welcome to the school and encourages her to join the team without even knowing if she can swim. She also reveals to Aki that they share some common physical traits (or so it seems) and a very special bond. There's a very steamy shower and kitchen floor scene between the two in this film and the latter even made me forget I was watching a splatter-comedy ....even one with T&A. A little Googling on Yuria will reveal she's done some pretty ""extravagant"" work during her JAV career. One of the prettiest ladies in the film whom I wish would have had a larger part, is Mizuka Arai. In this still from the classroom carnage scene, she's about to be a tasty bite for her zombiefied classmate. Ayumu Tokit plays Miss Mariko, a teacher who becomes a sex-starved homicidal maniac after being infected with the strange virus, which also causes her (for whatever reason) to speak in English. However, it's so poorly-enunciated, the English subtitles remain during her crazy rantings. If you have a collection of Japanese gore movies with gratuitous female nudity, this one is definitely worth adding to it.",1441756800,,1979,4.719653179190751
8311242,2,B001IOQW68,"""Attack Girls' Swim Team Versus The Undead"" is a movie I bought for the title alone. I will say off the bat that this is not a good movie, but for the title and the extremely original laser deployment in the film I gave it two stars. I'm not especially fond of zombie films though I'm not averse to them either. This one features a hilariously inept blend of over-chlorinated Japanese schoolgirls defending themselves in a confusing melee with the undead. The continuity and plausibility problems here are legion (even given the suspension of disbelief required for a zombie flick,) and the acting is exceptionally poor.

As far as I could understand it Aki (Sasa Handa,) a mysterious water assassin (?) (!) decides she really pines to be a schoolgirl, so she doffs her machine gun amphibious invasion ensemble and dons a school uniform and just shows up at a girl's school. Through a ridiculous mole and bruise identification subplot (don't ask,) she realizes her long lost twin sister already goes to school there. Unfortunately her arch nemesis has joined the faculty and is behind the nefarious plot to turn the students and faculty into zombies with a new vaccine. There are some terrible special effects (watch particularly for the astonishing bomb detonation and the aforementioned laser deployment scenes,) a juggling zombie math teacher, undead frivolity in the faculty lounge, and a scissor-related big toe amputation. Apparently the moral of the story is ""don't let the teachers have a chainsaw"" or perhaps ""beware of heat strain."" I cannot divulge more.

There are some eye-rolling adult situations (did I mention the laser beam?) which culminate in a truly astonishing flute captivation scene, but when Speedo one piece bathing suits pass for battle gear (their term, not mine) and guitars are horribly misappropriated on the floor of the school cafeteria kitchen, you can't expect a lot in the lucidity department. Top it off with extremely odd closing credits and you have a truly aberrant piece of Japanese popular culture that is like no other movie that I have ever seen.

8311244,1,B001IOQW68,"Let's get this right out right now, this is much less of a Zombie flick than it is Japanese soft porn.  Sure, there are some fast Zombies in crappy make up.  There are Zombies that speak and use weapons (in one case a mad teacher uses what might be metal meter sticks as swords).  One lady teacher Zombie seduces  a male teacher, ties him to a chair and then tells him she is going to eat his brain.  She then eats his brain.  The acting is horrible, even by Japanese Zombie movie standards.  The leading lady shows no emotion at all no matter what happens to her.  The script makes no sense whatever.  It has elements of mystery, horror and loads of porn all mixed up in a jumbles mess.  It is almost as if they made two or three different movies using the same actors and spliced them together at random.
 The main actress is seduced in a lesbian scene that is quite graphic.  She is raped a few times.  She trains as an assassin.  She fights Zombies.  She masturbates while the mad scientist plays the fluet to encourage her.  She suffers repeated betrayal by those that she trusts.
  But never does she change her expression.
 This horrible film should not be shown even in film school.  As a Zombie film it fails in the areas of make up and coherence and general competence.  Even the sound stinks.  As porn it fails because just when something thrilling comes to a conclusion on screen, the scene shifts to someone being ripped up with a chain saw or something which quite ruins the mood.
 It lasts only one hour and 20 minutes.  If we cut out the scenes with naked teen age Japanese girls it would be only half as long.  A rarely seen zero brain for Attack Girls Swim Team vs. the Un Dead.

8311247,1,B001IOQW68,"First, let me say that while I'm not a zombie or horror maniac, I'm not opposed to the genre at all (big Walking Dead fan).  The cover shows a handful of very cute Japanese girls in one-piece bathing suits.  I didn't expect to see Dances with Wolves here.  I fully expected a blood-soaked zombie killing spree (hopefully the zombies would be the cannon fodder) with beheadings and some cute Japanese girls in and out of their bathing suits.  Instead, what I watched was a movie any high school kid with a camera, some rubber arms and legs, and a bucket of fake blood could have written and filmed in about a week.

The plot made no sense.  A runaway girl, Aki, wants to leave her water-assassin-in-training life to beccome a high school girl like she's seen in a magazine.  She shows up at a random school for girls, but somehow her captor is already there, transforming the faculty and students into zombies via a flu vaccine.  At the school Aki finds her identical twin sister, who has already been at the school for some time, looks nothing like her, seduces her, and then betrays her, wanting to have the man who held them captive (and raped them daily) all to herself.  (She could have just killed her at any time.)  The girls' captor, who disguises himself as the school doctor and the new swimming coach (he kills the cruel coach of the swim team in the shower) later turns out to be a pair of twins, who took tunrs raping the girls, and wanted Aki all to himself.

Only the two girls (Aki with her best friend and supposed twin sister) ever actually fight the undead.  The rest of the swim team have very few lines, hide out (off camera) at the swimming pool for most of the movie, and then all fight the crazy female zombie English teacher who can't really speak English, all dying within about ten seconds in one of the worst choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen.

There was a lot of nudity, but most of it was the lead actress (who has silicone implants).  There's a bare butt for about five seconds.  The female teacher enters the men's room and has her bra pushed up for a few seconds, but in prudish zombie fashion, her bra is back in place for the rest of the film.

The graphic violence is mostly rubber arms and legs being dropped on the ground and fake blood being splashed and splattered against a wall.  Occasionally, a zombie will reach under a deceased victim and pull out a bloody intestine.

The fight scenes are mostly zombies and Aki circling each other, a punch or two, someone holding their head and acting dizzy, and maybe a kill shot.  There's also a mysterious laser beam from nowhere that frees the chained-up zombie teacher, and Aki kills one of her captors with a laser beam from her vagina.  It seems that even the folks that made the movie couldn't find a way out of the ridiculous plot holes.

It appears as though the person who wrote the script found a couple of girls that would take off their clothes and kiss and a guy that could juggle and do a firebreathing bit and made a movie around it, hoping to show his buddies.  Sometimes I actually like to watch a campy movie, knowing not to take it too seriously, but AGSTvTU was beyond campy.  A little effort--just a little--in making this film would have been nice.

With AV Superstar Sasa Handa leading the cast (I was unsure what AV Superstar meant exactly but 30 minutes in it became pretty clear) this movie prides itself on the amount of exploitation it manages to wrench from its unbeatable comination of a Girls Swim Team + Sasa Handa + Zombies . With a smaller budget than the likes of Meatball Machine or Mutant Girls Squad it does share the same level of unhinged imagination and the burning desire to entertain through an outlandish story told in the most excessive way possible with extra ketchup.",1315180800,,827,4.703448275862069
