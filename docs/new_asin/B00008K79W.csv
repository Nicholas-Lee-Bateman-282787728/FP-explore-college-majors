7984957,5,B00008K79W,"Wanted to see this again for nearly 40 years...That's about how long it has been since it was shown on Television. CBS used to show this every year around Thanksgiving and it became a Tradition, at least for the few years it was shown.",1464393600,,235,4.363636363636363

Thanks for helping me relive a part of my childhood through this animated feature!",1388361600,,256,5.219512195121951

The picture and film quality is not as good as modern dramas and the makers did not have Millions of pounds to play with, but this is by far one of the best and most historically `accurate' versions of Robin Hood I have ever seen.

The element of political intrigue adds another dimension to the plot, making it more than the simple Hood in the forest stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. So Eleanor of Aquitaine and Prince John are prominent characters, and there is much plotting and scheming amongst them. It also includes several new characters, such as Sir Kenneth, Marion's Uncle, who are interesting and well developed.

Marion is independent and can stand up for herself, but does not feel the necessity to 'do everything the men do and best them at it' as do many modern versions of her character. Her resistance is in assisting Robin behind the scenes not very implausibly wielding a heavy sword too big for her and fighting off whole groups of soldiers with it. There is no female superhero/ninja nightwatchman here, but Marion is all the more likeable for this and not so perfect as her BBC successor.

One of my favourite characters was Robin's ever faithful friend and sidekick friar Tuck. He is the stereotypical tipsy clergymen, but here Tuck does remain faithful to many of his religious convictions, and is not irreverent, hypocritical, or violent and murderous as some other Tucks. Here he is insightful, sympathetic and indispensable.

Most interestingly this series contains many original elements that seem have been emulated by later versions. In this version for instance Gisborne has a vindictive sister and Tuck is very much a warrior as well as a clergyman, which goes to show that the recent BBC version was not the first to include these things.

The only gripe I have is that the low-budget nature of the series does show quite a lot, especially when the characters are wearing wooden crowns, or 'jewellery' that is quite obviously painted wood. Having said that the costumes are excellent, and those of the noble characters look fittingly expensive, he fight scenes are convincing and the series (though I would very much have liked it to be longer) is excellent in almost every respect.",1334361600,2,2300,4.812658227848101
7984960,5,B00008K79W,I enjoyed Robin Hood even though it was 30 years old. The acting was superb. It gave a new and nearly historical account of Robin's life.,1329868800,,137,4.3076923076923075
7984961,5,B00008K79W,"I viewed this offering in the 1970's when it was hosted by the late Bill Bixby.  Excellent in every way.  I have not seen a better rendition of the story; hopefully the companions ""Legend of King Arthur"" with David Robb, and the ""Talisman"" will eventually be published on DvD as well.  This set can be enjoyed by the whole family.",1307491200,,330,4.466666666666667
