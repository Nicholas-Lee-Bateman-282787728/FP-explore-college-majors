1632103,5,B00005NFYL,"I have enjoyed listening to this story for over 12 years on cassette, before I finally found it on DVD this past winter.  Of all the Dorothy Sayers stories I have listened to and read, this is the best and most well designed of the lot.  Watching the story unfold on DVD brought back a lot of the memories I had from living in England for 4 years.  Ian Carmichael plays the role of Lord Peter just right, as do the other characters.  Having listened to the voices for so long, I felt I knew the characters so well.  If you enjoy English mystery, whether it be Agatha Christie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Frances Durbridge, Dorothy Sayers, among so many, you will enjoy this DVD, as well as the others in this series.  It is a truly special series of mysteries that add tremendously to the genre.",1027555200,6,792,4.35374149659864

1632106,5,B00005NFYL,"With cross and candle and bell-knelling....More than one of the characters in THE NINE TAILORS is haunted. Lord Peter Wimsey and his valet Bunter are haunted by their recent experiences in France, where they spent too many weeks in the trenches. Other characters are haunted by events that transpired before WWI. The nine tailors are a set of very old and large bells that hang in the tower of a church in East Anglia. Each of the bells was specially cast and each has a name. On high holy days in the Anglican Church, such as the Feast of the Epiphany, the bells are rung by a group of men. Wimsey takes part in the change ringing and it is glorious. Dorothy Sayers was intrigued with Anglican theology, and in her later years she abandoned mystery writing for the study of theology. Every chapter of THE NINE TAILORS is preceded by a quotation involving instructions to clergy, change-ringing, and the like. Each is a clue. I believe Sayers was haunted -- like P.D. James -- by East Anglia, that odd part of England with a long violent history. THE NINE TAILORS is the best mystery I've ever read. It will appeal to those who like a literal case, but it will also appeal to those who sense that life itself is a mystery, and that even the greatest sleuth cannot solve it. I read the book, saw the original dramatization of the story, and then haunted by this incredible story, I traveled in East Anglia searching for the church. It does exist, and it contains one of the most beautifully carved interiors in England. Ultimately, the church provides Wimsey with many of the clues he needs to solve several mysteries. For there are several mysteries involving the theft of priceless jewels, betrayal, and murder. The question as always is whether or not these mysteries are related, and whether or not the same individual is responsible for all the evil deeds. I have been waiting a long time for the DVD and I am so glad ACORN finally is ready to release it.",999129600,46,1959,4.568181818181818
1632107,5,B00005NFYL,"I have always liked this series with Ian Carmichael as Wimsey, and THE NINE TAILORS has always been my favorite.  I am glad to see it on DVD, as my old videos are fading fast.
Acorn Media took great care with the transfer of this title, and you'd never know it was originally shot back in 1974!  It looks better than many of the recent transfers I've run across.
The story adaptation is well-paced, Carmichael is marvelous as Wimsey, and the supporting cast (especially Houston as Bunter) are great, as well.
If you have to buy one of these series as a first, even though it is out of order, buy THE NINE TAILORS.  The background information on how Lord Peter and Bunter met, and how the story unfolds, is somewhat crucial to understanding the entire Wimsey/Bunter relationship.
Bravo!",998438400,14,785,4.633093525179856
1632108,5,B00005NFYL,"Many viewers who have seen the various titles that have been filmed in the Lord Peter Wimsey series may be wondering how he met his manservant Bunter and how they formed their impressive partnership.  Early in ""The Nine Taylors"" that mystery is solved as we watch Sargeant Bunter save the life of Captain Wimsey in the trenches in WWI.  Later Bunter visits Lord Peter in London and hints that he would like to become Lord Peter's manservant.  Bunter is far more than a servant in these stories, even though he understands his role as gentleman's gentleman and accepts it for what it is.  In my opinion The Nine Taylors is one of Dorothy Sayers' best novels and the producers have been faithful in their adaptation of this mystery story.  It is the also the best of the series which now is complete.  Ian Carmichael is one of the reasons for the success of this series.  He is the perfect Lord Peter.  The English Monarchy might use him as a model for what a royal should be.  His grace, charm, intelligence, and wit are always in the service of others and Carmichael brings out the nobility of the man who has not lost the common touch.  Next, the producers are so lavish in their attention to detail that it seems like we have truly stepped through the looking glass into the world of the English gentry just after WWI.  Nothing is overlooked and no expense is spared to recreate this lost time.  Finally, the mystery is wonderfully intricate and complex and takes all of Lord Peter's keen observation and analytic powers to finally solve the case.  ""Brideshead Revisited"" remains my choice as the finest television series ever made, but ""The Nine Taylors"" comes in a close second.  This is television at its best and a special treat for a discerning audience.",996364800,20,1761,4.638709677419355
1632109,5,B00005NFYL,"The release by Acorn Media on two DVDs of the 5th Lord Peter Wimsey mystery adaptation, <The Nine Tailors>, brings to completion the series of Wimsey videos telecast back in the 70s and eagerly awaited for nearly three decades by devotees. This story stands in relation to the other four as ""The Yeomen of the Guard"" stands in relation to the other Gilbert & Sullivan works. Both are darker than the others, far more serious, and ironic where the others are paradoxical (not to say whimsical).
  Very much like the situation in the classic ""Trent's Last Case,"" every one of Wimsey's assumptions in ""Tailors"" proves to be wrong. He is mistaken in the identity of the handless, faceless victim (as the viewer will probably guess anyway) but also in the identity of the killer, which he learns in a most unusually dramatic way--but more I cannot say without ruining it all.
 The feeling of life in a very small English community is beautifully brought across by the usual superb acting of even the most minor characters, especially the pretty postmistress. The plot, which is (face it) the most important feature of any mystery, is fairly convoluted but nothing  as complicated as that of ""Five Red Herrings"" in which the whereabouts of several characters have to be kept in mind along with several train schedules. Here we know, for the most part, several things Wimsey does not; but not enough for us to be certain about the more important events.
 The question at the back of the murder is to what extent a person might be justified in committing a crime when the victim is evil and not committing it would lead to undeserved personal degradation. But again, I cannot reveal too much.
 Ian Carmichael is far less Bertie Woosterish in this episode, his Bunter (Glyn Houston) as Jeevish as ever without being comically so, and the local Reverend (Donald Eccles) for once not a sanctimonious bore.
 And so, now that we have all five sets, the first three only on tape but soon to be on DVD, the last two in both formats, allow me to recommend them in this order for those who have none yet: ""Murder Must Advertise,"" ""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club,"" ""The Nine Tailors,"" ""Clouds of Witness,"" and ""Five Red Herrings."" They are all very good indeed, so I am using a somewhat ambiguous ""enjoyability"" factor in my ordering of them.",996019200,27,2332,4.729064039408867
1632160,5,B00005NFYL,"Wonderful story.  Wonderful performance by Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey.  Interesting mystery solved in an interesting fashion, as usual, by Lord Peter. Great screenplay from the original Dorothy Sayers mystery.  All in all, a tremendous four hours of viewing pleasure.  If you are a fan of Dorothy Sayers, a fan of the BBC, or if you love great mysteries and a lead performer (Ian Carmichael) who matches the great portrayal of Sherlock Holmes by Basil Rathbone, this is a must for you.",1354838400,,494,4.9156626506024095
1632161,5,B00005NFYL,"This DVD is an excellent adaptation of Sayers' book!  Practically every twist, turn, and detail of the book is skillfully incorporated.  Often characters are speaking Sayers' exact lines.  The views of the fine old church add what a book cannot give.  The actual sound of the bells also, though not very musical, add a valuable dimension.",1311638400,,338,4.982142857142857

1632163,5,B00005NFYL,"To my mind this is the best of the noted BBC dramatizations of five Lord Peter Wimsey books by Dorothy Sayers, starring Ian Carmichael. Here we meet the young Wimsey, attending a wedding in uniform, just prior to reporting to his regiment, on the brink of World War 1. After some startling events following the wedding, we see him on the receiving end of an artillery shell on the Front, which occasions his lasting indebtedness to his Sergeant, Bunker, whom later we see, both invalided out of service for wounds sustained, forming a lasting friendship as Lord Peter and his Man, Bunker. By chance, they are in the village, within which these post-wedding events occurred, some 20 years later. Lord Peter fills in for a victim of Flu in ringing a work for bells, hence the name 9 Tailors. While there, events occur which are related to the post-wedding happenings, which. in turn, lead Lord Peter to return to the village and take a hand in the proceedings.
With this more elaborate prelude to action, we are thus given greater insight than in other stories in the series, to see Lord Peter as the man under the mask. The drama is more intense, the tone, in general, more serious than in other series entries, but the acting, scenic design, and characterizations quite up to the standard maintained throughout.
This is the drama with which to start one's viewing of the series(if it is available to you). It is the first chronologically (in the life of Lord Peter) and the first in quality. For any devotee of the old-fashioned ""classic"" mystery filmed in the traditional manner, this will provide a most satisfying experience.",1270944000,,1628,4.776595744680851

1632166,5,B00005NFYL,"The Nine Tailors is generally agreed to be Sayers' finest book. There isn't much romance, but it uses flashbacks to put Lord Peter Wimsey in the frame of the First World War and explain his relationship to Bunter, his faithful man servant. Ian Carmichael delivers one of the outstanding performances of his career. The other characters are real, believable, people who suffered through WWI and the 1930's.",1221436800,,405,5.059701492537314

1632168,1,B00005NFYL,"I love this series a lot and enjoyed the first half of this particular mystery however there was a problem with the disc. This is a two disc set and while the second disc is correctly marked, it is actually a duplicate of the first disc! This is obviously a mistake in the factory but it is highly frustrating since it happened not once, but twice. It's quite frustrating to be left on a cliff hanger and then have the second half of the mystery be unavailable. By all means, buy this wonderful mystery but note that there are some defective sets floating around. I have ordered my third set and hope to finally see the ending. All I can say is, Buyer Beware, check both discs right away so you can return it promptly if you need to.",1037232000,15,733,4.280575539568345
1632169,5,B00005NFYL,"The Nine Tailors is my favorite Wimsey mystery,and not surprisingly, it is my favorite of the Ian Carmichael series which were produced in the 1970s.  Here we see Lord Peter's early life as he attends a wedding where an expensive emerald necklace goes missing.  World War I interrupts before an investigation can begin, and Wimsey goes off to fight.  We see him meet Bunter, later his faithful valet/assistant, and eventually wind up back in the vicinity of the spot where the necklace went missing.  His interest piqued, Wimsey resumes the investigation just as some surprising events and mysterious strangers reminds everyone in the village of the robbery.  The untangling of this mystery is vintage Dorothy L.Sayers, with twists and turns and lots of red herrings.  You also get to learn a lot about church bell peals.  Highly recommended.",1032739200,9,842,5.057971014492754
7946782,5,B00005NFYL,"A young Lord Peter (Ian Carmichael) in formal uniform on his way to the war. He is standing in for his brother The Duke of Denver at a wedding. Mischief is afoot and an emerald necklace was pinched. Where it was stored for save keeping I can not say. It looks like the perpetrator was winged by a well placed shot. We get the inside story and know the truth.

All in the first chapter we see the crime and the fait of the perpetrators. We also get a first hand view of the meeting and growing relationship and Wimsey and Bunter (Glyn Houston.) As fait would have it Lord Peter finds him self once again in Fenchurch St. Pauli. This time as providence would have it just in time to replace a sick bell ringer on New Year's Eve.

Three months later a body is found in and Lord Peter is invited to the inquest.

This film is based on a Dorothy L. Sayers novel of the same name with the screen adaptation by Anthony Steven.

At first you are not sure that this is the same peter Wimsey when you see the blond hair and mustache. However if you look close they made little attempt to cover the wrinkled face.

If you have, an opportunity to view this film before reading the book you will not be distracted by the deviations and omissions form the written story.",1506038400,2,1256,4.2384937238493725

7946784,5,B00005NFYL,"I bought the double boxed set of DVDs and love it.  Carmichael is just perfect as Lord Peter Wimsey.  I have one question about the theft of Lady Wilbraham's emeralds.  When she goes to bed, we see her dismiss her maid and then put the jewels in their case and put the case in a ceramic chamber pot. I guess she figures she is not going to need it,  The case is rectangular and actually protrudes out of the pot.  She then places the case and pot in a wooden cabinet beside her bed.  Then she climbs into bed.  But when Deacon sneaks in to rob her, he reaches under the bed in order to get them. Not into the small wooden cabinet.  There is no sign of the chamber pot. Deacon grabs the case, struggles to open the window, makes such a racket that he wakes Lady Wilbraham up, and must jump to the ground where he hands off the case to his accomplice.  Then Deacon circles back around to the house and pretends nothing has happened.  So when did Deacon switch the jewels out of the case?  Is that just a scene the director edited out of the final cut?  And how did the case get out of the chamber pot in the wooden cabinet and under Lady Wilbraham's bed?",1484438400,,1152,4.13963963963964

7946790,5,B00005NFYL,"This is, truly, one of the greatest mystery stories ever written, especially since there are NO ""red herrings"".  Sayers is scrupulously fair, and literally throws the solution at you every chance she gets.  But you won't see it because the beautifully written story, the powerfully drawn characters, and the haunting Fen country will dominate your attention.  (Plus, of course, as usual there's Wimsey's wit and panache!)

However, I've one quibble with the reviewers.  Too many of them say the ""Nine Tailors"" are the bells.  No.  The Nine Tailors are the number of times the bells are rung to signal a man's death.  (Women get eight ""tellers"".)

And because they are so important to the story, you deserve to know the names of the bells.  (Trust me, you will remember them.)
