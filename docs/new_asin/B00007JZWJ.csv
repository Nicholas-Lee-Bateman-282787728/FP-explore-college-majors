7977479,5,B00007JZWJ,"I just love to see Burton work.  Every action, every word is like an acting lesson.  And he's so handsome!  I think of his gritty background yet the hard intelligence that got him to the top of his game.  I love his voice and he uses it as an instrument.

Of this group, I like ""The Kansmen"" the best. I remember when it came out.  All the ""Blacksploitation"" Movies turned me off--and I'm black!  But the furor of the era is well behind us and I can sit back and appreciate Burton acting in what I'm reading all around me is ""one of the worst films every made.""

I enjoyed all the stereotypes.  I loved Lee Marvin's professionalism also as he like Burton treated ""The Klansman"" like the big studio epics they had been part of.  I loved to hear his voice too and his screen presence.  They both know how to rivet the viewer.  Who cares what the story is about?",1381536000,,859,4.234567901234568
7977480,2,B00007JZWJ,"Bought this triple DVD set from the States to the UK because I wanted a legit DVD copy of Green Grow the Rushes. Quality is no better than VHS, but the worst thing was though they have ""butchered"" Green Grow the Rushes, they have cut important parts of the film so it is NOT a complete film WHY? It is an innocent ""Ealing"" type of early 50's comedy film so what is the problem? Seems like I will have to still stick with my TCM copy from years ago until someone else takes it upon themselves to release a proper digital version.",1306540800,,528,4.186274509803922
7977481,1,B00007JZWJ,"I got to this Triple Feature DVD offering on a search for Burton's MY COUSIN RACHEL.  After 10 minutes of trying to figure out what 3 movies are contained in this set, I gave up and read a review to find the answer.  I think it rather lame to offer three movies and not tell customers the names of the three movies.",1195776000,,315,4.064516129032258
7977482,2,B00007JZWJ,"Mainly in response to the first (non-)""review"" I spent a while with the (grainy) image of the case artwork and the Internet Movie Data Base.

The three films appear to be ""The Klansman"" (1974), ""Divorce His - Divorce Hers"" (w/ L. Taylor - 1973), and ""Green Grow the Rushes) (1951). While I'm not an expert on Burton movies, I don't recall any of these as having a reputation for excellence. As I got here following a search for ""Becket"" - which is magnificent, but not presently available on DVD - I share the earlier reviewer's concern.",1169424000,,537,4.59375
7977483,1,B00007JZWJ,It would help if you'd list the films in this collection so I could tell if I wanted to buy it.,1166054400,,95,3.5714285714285716
