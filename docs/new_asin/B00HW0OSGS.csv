6230120,5,B00HW0OSGS,"Zany. One intensely crazy situations after another.
A FULL CAST OF BIZARRE CHARACTERS YOU'LL LOVE TO LAUGH AT. Keep the remote in hand for many a `pause' while recovering from belly laughs. A hullabaloo of hilarious one-liners. More LOL than I've done over a series in the past 5 years.
Cast led by Ed (Anthony Head) and Lauren (Eve Myles), significant others with a 26 year age gap. 9 more regulars keep this extremely fast-pace humor.
Perfect for when you just need something fun; totally off the serious side.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 6 episodes and bonus material.
1  -Lauren & Ed cohabitate and her family visits/inspects. That causes comic chaos, including his uninvited EX (Lindsay Duncan -Rector's Wife).

2  -The pair does dinner with Lauren's parents (Susie Blake & Jeff Rawle.) Sis-in-law (Daisy Beaumont) invites grandson Tim (Joshua McGuire.) Brother Alan's (Nigel Betts) third person on his date is Ed's EX, Lydia. Confused? Mags played by Felicity Montagu (Doc Martin.)

3  -Redecorating ideas become a Lauren/Ed tiff. How can dishwasher dysfunction become so funny?

4  -Bereavement humor. Debs & Keith (Marcus Garvey) tackle a dying sex life, while their daughter (Alice Felgate) tries some killer consorting.

5  -The men try a bit of social bonding over sports. Ladies meet McCready.

6  -Lauren & Ed tested during a BBQ. Alan & Keith go testy over hamburgers.",1395619200,2,1377,5.04424778761062
6230121,4,B00HW0OSGS,Enjoyed the series but had difficulty getting it to play and then when it would play at times would just freeze.,1468627200,,112,4.380952380952381
6230122,2,B00HW0OSGS,"As much as I adore Anthony Head, this show is sub-par and totally predictable. Older man, younger woman dynamic not very creative.",1467417600,,130,4.954545454545454
6230123,5,B00HW0OSGS,"Only was able to watch 2 episodes of this series and love it!  Now I cannot get any of the remaining videos in the series to play on any of my devices.  I have rebooted the modem multiple times, reconnected my devise, and to no avail.  All other prime videos play just fine!",1466553600,,274,4.132075471698113

6230131,5,B00HW0OSGS,"The plot is a bit predictable, you know the outcome of each argument and situation before it plays out on screen, but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic show. The acting is superb and makes the whole show seem effortless. The characters over the top and yet easily identifiable. It's easy to laugh at without having to focus on every little word, but when you do it just makes it that much better.",1446768000,,406,4.426666666666667
6230132,4,B00HW0OSGS,"First of all, I should say I am a big Eve Myles fan, otherwise I would not have paid the outrageous price for purchasing the series.  Fortunately, I was not disappointed.  There is a Season 2 being produced.  Hopefully by then Amazon will price this show correctly.",1436745600,,265,4.595744680851064
6230133,5,B00HW0OSGS,A wonderful series. Wish there was a Series 2! Excellent cast of characters and actors. So enjoyable to see GOOD comedy!,1421366400,,120,4.761904761904762
6230134,5,B00HW0OSGS,"The show is a comedy about a couple, Ed and Lauren, who have a large age gap but are in love with each other. Their meddling families make life difficult for them at times, but they still are family.

If you want a good laugh and need something to watch other than another crime drama or stupid reality tv, this show is for you.

British tv seasons are very short, only 6 episodes. I am so happy they have been set for a second season!",1414195200,,435,4.105882352941176

6230138,4,B00HW0OSGS,Fine slapstick British fun.  If you have kids and relatives you should find eerie similarities to these characters.  That's what I heard anyway.,1403395200,,144,5.217391304347826
6230139,5,B00HW0OSGS,"Really fun, up beat, helps if you had bad day!! Love Anthony Head!!!! Hope for Series 2!! Must watch ASPA!",1400284800,,106,4.35
6230140,5,B00HW0OSGS,"A comedy about romance with an age difference of 26 years might seem to be an old concept, but in You, Me & Them the story line is given a fresh and really funny treatment.  The problems are not so much with Ed (Anthony Head) and Lauren (Eve Myles) and their relationship, as they are conflicts with the ""Them"" of the series.  A normal couple, Ed and Lauren are surrounded by a group of odd characters who seem determined to cause them trouble.  Topping the list is the next door neighbor (played by Lyndsay Duncan) who also happens to be Ed's ex-wife.  She of course wants him back, and apparently will do anything to sabotage the happy couple aided unknowingly by Ed's awkward brother, and smarmy grandson.  Eve's family is no help either, as her parents consider her immature and incapable of making a good decision, and her married sister brings her own family drama into the mix.  It sounds as though it would be a sad tale of dysfunctional living, but You, Me & Them is sweet, touching, outrageously funny, and takes a look at surviving in a relationship against the strangest set of circumstances.  I don't want to give examples because part of the fun is how the twists and turns work in this series.  It is in turn sophisticated and silly, and I love it.  I can't wait for series 2.",1397606400,5,1291,4.482905982905983

8636620,4,B00HW0OSGS,"This is a fun series which is off the wall. The actors do a good job in their parts and Lindsay Duncan shines in just about anything she does and playing the ex wife is no exception. If you like things that take twists and turns and makes you think what just happened, you will have fun with  this...",1480204800,,300,4.084745762711864

8636622,2,B00HW0OSGS,"Cringeworthy nonhumor about a couple who are surrounded by dysfunctional family and it's not clear why they don't just cut off contact with all of them. Also, old dude and way younger gal is treated like a novelty when it's already a tired construct. No interracial? Everybody is straight? This is made in 2013??? I so miss Anthony Head and wanted to like this but I didn't crack one smile in the pilot. So, moving on to something else.",1472947200,,436,4.531645569620253

8636627,5,B00HW0OSGS,"Omg! This is hilarious :-) Lauren and Ed live together in Ed's beautiful house. He has a lot of money but that's not why Lauren loves him, but her family hates him because he's so much older. Although, they do come around later.

Then you have Ed's brother that lives with them. He is hilarious in everything he does from running around naked to giving everyone athletes foot by running his feet across the carpet.  You also have Ed's ex-wife that moved next door and she's always showing up and causing trouble.

This show is just hilarious with all of the craziness going on :-D",1469232000,,580,4.504761904761905
