7733779,3,B01E9MTYGA,"B-3, The Next Cut, gets credit for immersing itself in the current realities of gang warfare and mounting, near daily, murders on Chicago's Southside. Once again, Calvin considers re-locating to another neighborhood but this also would take down the adjacent women's salon (a new addition to the franchise) not to mention Calvin's staff of barbers. What to do? Instagram and Facebook to the rescue! Well, almost, thanks to some plot-forcing.

This film is a VERY mixed bag and the writing is uneven. A number of the script lines whiz by so fast that you cannot understand them. And some of the plot points combine with anatomical abundance to over-emphasize physical humor .... or attempts at it: BIG BOOTY JOKES! Enough already!

B-3 paints its story with broad strokes and caricatured urban black types, and for this reviewer, even a little bit of that style goes a very long way. You've been warned.

But after all the trash-talking and gang menace, TNC ultimately affirms admirable conservative virtues in a fairly effective manner: family values, neighborhood stability/cohesiveness, and small business as the bedrock of community -- even when it is menaced by supra-armed ""gangstas,"" easily and lethally equipped thanks to the effective lobbying of the NRA and its white rural ""2nd Amendment"" defenders.

I think B-2 is the best of the series so far. I cannot imagine what story B-4 would try to tell.",1461456000,6,1407,5.051724137931035

7733782,2,B01E9MTYGA,"I enjoyed the first two installments in this series.
The cast is always good, even in this one despite many only making cameos, or not being in it with the time passed, etc.
This one doesn't break the series at it's core.
Unfortunately, it would seem the writing team knew the characters, but couldn't come up with anything for them to talk about but a bunch of political nonsense.
The four 25 minutes of this movie glosses over key plot points like the beauty shop being fused with the barber shop, no development for new characters we want to like, etc. It's like a 25 minute discussion on ""what's wrong with the world"" except it's even worse than that. We got some indian guy saying ""I don't like white people"" and nobody even looks at him wierd. We have a guy who was totally ready to cheat on his wife and if he wasn't going to get caught he was going to do it, he even admits he might as well after being accused when nothing had started.

This isn't ""Barbershop."" It doesn't work with the rest of the series in that instead of focusing on the characters and what they feel they need to make it in this world, admidst all the bad, and decisions made ""with the best intentions"" but not the right ones, is so in the backdrop.
I thought it'd be pretty enjoyable to revisit the world made from the first two after so long, literally from my early teens to now my latter 20's.
This movie is just not good. It's political speak for 1/2 the runtime and is also an extremely down in the dumps angle they doesn't make for better drama. If they were trying to make it ""current"" and believable, it goes the total opposite way. And if this is ""realistic,"" than it's pretty pathetic.
I'm glad I watched this for free on hulu, paying $4.00 for it would've irritated me. As it is I somehow managed to sit through it despite being pretty done 50 minutes in, it didn't do anything to want me to push it up to 3 stars, so it stays at 2. Why not one? Well, maybe people will go and watch the other two since Ice Cube's star power is clearly not letting up (Ride Along 1 and 2), and it did have stuff in the backdrop. If only they'd put all of that front and center, and made the movie about 20 minutes shorter, it would've been a worthy entry even if the ""sell out the shop"" angle was also used before.
Don't waste your time-Ice Cube fan, looking to see why they made a sequel so many years later, heck tbh I never thought ""Barbershop 2"" was that great, not in comparison to the original. But this sequel makes it look great. Skip this one unless you can see it for free or a dollar, just for the sake of forming your own opinion. I really hope if they do decide to make another one they skip over washed up storyline and endless political talk.",1510617600,,2732,4.243761996161228

7733848,2,B01E9MTYGA,"This movie tries to be many things and doesn't quite hit the mark on any of them. There are a lot of stories working to be told, politics, gang violence, black live, family dynamics, but none of them are fleshed out into anything meaningful. There was one pivotal scene in particular that had the potential to make a real impact but instead was glossed over with an unrealistic conclusion. This movie is a half-hearted attempt at speaking on the issues being dealt with by the black community, specifically in Chicago, but doesn't quite tell you a coherent story. Not to mention, it's getting tiresome watching Calvin, played by Ice Cube, throw a tantrum in each Barbershop film.

The people at the barbershop also try to get two gang members to form a truce at least for a weekend so they can throw a cease fire type of party. This movie pretty much deals with alot of the violence going on in Chicago something the movie Chiraq failed to do. It's finally good to see a movie that brings back the essence of the early to mid 90s when movies had messages in them, you don't see to many movies in this lame decade that takes violence in the streets serious like this nowadays, this generation seems to be passive.

7733874,3,B01E9MTYGA,"Barbershop: The Next Cut,"" the third film in the comedy franchise, once again focuses on Calvin (Ice Cube) and his longtime crew, including Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), who are still hanging around the shop, though it has undergone some major changes. Most prominently, the once male-dominated shop is now co-ed. The ladies bring their own gossip and drama, challenging the guys constantly to comic effect. In contrast to the good times, big laughs, and camaraderie within the shop, the surrounding community has taken a turn for the worse. Calvin and his friends come together in an effort to save not only the shop, but the neighborhood as well.

Though this installment of the franchise veers into more serious social commentary, it retains the easy repartee among a colorful group of folks, exchanging opinions, gently dissing one another, and  this time around  continuing the ages-old battle of the sexes. Director Malcolm D. Lee keeps the pace brisk, the one-liners coming, and the conflicts simmering just enough to keep us involved.

Comedy ensemble work is not that common in feature films, which are usually based around a star. The new Ghostbusters is an exception. The Barbershop films understand the secret of getting laughs  clever writing, point-perfect delivery, and great chemistry among the cast. Even though the characters deal with a troubled neighborhood and the movie aspires to provide a socially conscious message, the carefree chit chat in the shop keeps things percolating.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include the featurette The Next Cut: Barbershop Bootcamp, deleted scenes with director Malcolm D. Lee, and gag reel.",1469404800,,1661,5.2727272727272725

The first one was funny but didn't think it needed a sequel. The second one was really bad and I didn't like it at all. This one though I thought was the best of all 3. That being said that all pretty much have the same plot. This one has nothing all that original and the movie is fairly predictable but the reason to watch isn't for the plot. This movie has a great and very timely message. It was a little strange to see the guy responsible for F the Police to have such a strong anti-violence moviebut that actually adds a little to the impact of it. Overall, the best of the series with one of the best messages of any movie in the last few years. I actually recommend this for that, and the laughs.

In the case of ""Barbershop: The Next Cut"", the third film in the franchise or fourth if you want to include spinoff ""Beauty Shop"", it doesn't feel as if any time has passed at all. That's a remarkable feat given all of the lousy comedy sequels of late, many of which separated from their predecessors by more than a decade. But with ""Barbershop"", it succeeds by staying focused on the core values that have made these movies so beloved and successful: faith, family, and community.

And right away it's clear that 'The Next Cut' is going to be more topical than before, acting as a response to the gun violence plaguing Chicago. While this may seem like well-worn territory in the wake of Spike Lee's ""Chi-Raq"", it delivers its message of non-violence through comforting jokes and freshly cut hair rather than elaborate rhyming verse. Another reason it doesn't feel as if any time has passed is that most of the cast is back, looking and acting much the same as before. Ice Cube returns as Calvin, whose barbershop remains a pillar of the Chicago community. He's always weighed down by some hardship or other, and in this case he's worried about the safety of his son, Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.), who is beginning to see the allure of the gangster lifestyle. Shaggy, motormouthed veteran Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) is still flappin' his gums more than he cuts actual hair. His observations are as pinpoint and controversial as ever, whether they be on the fairer sex, Barack Obama, or the inevitable Bill Cosby crack.

Like Eddie, many of the characters seem to be in the same place they've always been, but a few have taken some interesting forward steps. Angie (Regina Hall, rockin' a mean blue-haired look) is now part owner, with her beauty shop occupying half the space and doubling the tension. The perpetually hard-working Terri (Eve) is now married to the soulful Rashad (Common, making his first appearance in the series), but their marriage is troubled and he's caught the eye of bootylicious stylist, Dreya (Nicki Minaj). If anything, the ""Barbershop"" movies have done a lot to promote rapper/actor careers, and they all have fit in well, probably due to the loose, laid back atmosphere. Other new additions fit right in, such as JB Smoove as the shady, enterprising One-Stop; ""New Girl""'s Lamorne Morris as the nerdy Jarrod; Utkarsh Ambudkar as cool Indian barber, Raja; and Margot Bingham makes a mighty impression as Bree, the resident feminist sista.

Each has their own subplot going on, and the screenplay often struggles to keep up with them. The same goes for returning director Malcolm D. Lee, who has an understandable amount of difficulty keeping track of a dozen characters holding court in the same room. While some of these subplots don't work (like Anthony Anderson's shady food truck business), when these characters are allowed to just riff off one another the film is a laugh riot because much of what they say rings true. ""Barbershop"" cultivated a certain chemistry right from the very beginning and it has never gone away, even as characters come and go. So when the gang makes fun of Eddie for being old and useless, it doesn't feel mean-spirited, but the gentle ribbing all friends give one another.

That familiarity also makes the painful moments sting just a little bit more, and no matter how much fun is being had, we're always pulled back into Chicago's grim reality. As well intentioned as the gang violence plot may be, it often makes for a clumsy and heavy-handed fit for a film that clearly wants to make you laugh first. Every time we catch up with Jalen it's like being slapped in the face with a dead fish; you just want to go back to the warming embrace of the barbershop where people are busy jonin on one another. But even that get messed up by a couple of violent blow-ups right under Calvin's roof, leading him to make a fateful and sobering decision to protect his son's future.

It's interesting to think back to where Ice Cube was 20 years ago. Not only was he embroiled in a vicious rap feud with Common (check out Common's diss track, ""Bitch in Yoo"" where he absolutely crushes Cube), but he was starring in ""Boyz n the Hood"", one of the first films to really bring the issue of gang violence to a broader audience. Many of the same themes and simple solutions then are made in ""Barbershop: The Next Cut"", only now Cube is about as far away from Doughboy as anyone could have ever imagined. In that film, it would have been inconceivable for the President of the United States to come walking into South Central. But now, the first African-American President (or a reasonable facsimile) can stroll right into Calvin's Chicago barbershop; get a fresh cut and a chance at some side booty. In a way, that sounds a lot like progress.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbershop-The-Next-Cut/dp/B01DYYXCIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbershop: The Next Cut</a>",1463788800,2,5025,4.893192488262911
7733878,4,B01E9MTYGA,"We all know that Ice Cube likes his movies to contain a message. This one is no exception. In fact it does it extremely well... This PG-13 outing (language and sexual situations) shows us how important Community is to our society, as first shown in Calvin's Barbershop, 10 years ago.

So what has happened in the 10 years since last we visited our friends? Director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man Holiday"") is happy to show us. Now half of our favorite gathering place is devoted to the girls! It's no longer an all-male sanctuary where the guys can relax, gossip and shoot the breeze, but a shared space where weaves, wigs and women also find one another (AND chime in on some of the guys' gossip!).

Here is part of the cast:
  * Ice Cube (""Ride Along"") is Calvin, worried about his testy teenage son and thinking about moving his family and relocating his shop to a safer part of Chicago.
  * Jasmin Lewis (""Barbershop"") Jennifer shares her husband's concerns but wants to give their boy time to grow up a bit before they yank him away from his classmates and move to a new part of town.
  * Regina Hall (""Vacation"") Angie understands Calvin's concern, but her beauty shop is half of their business and this business partner isn't ready to move.
  * Nicki Minaj (""The Other Woman"") Draya can't help but flirt, and it's obvious that she has Rashad in her sights
  * Common (""The Wiz Live!"") Rashad tries to stay out of Draya's clutches. The bigger challenge is convincing his wife that he HAS stayed out of Draya's clutches!
  * Eve (""With This Ring"") Terri is even more successful than ever and doing a lot of traveling. Problem is, she can tell Draya is eying her man...
  * Cedric the Entertainer (""The Soul Man"") Eddie never shuts up. He is the Grand Old Man in that little community and he gets upset every time he sees baggy pants and dreadlocks or hears guns.
  * Anthony Anderson (""Black-ish"") J.D. claims the revenue from his business is for the Boys and Girls Clubs in their part of Chicago... Ummm.... Uh oh.....
A barbershop is the unofficial community club of the neighborhood. We have a chance to hear all sides of today's issues, delivered with insight, conviction, and heart. These are good people, trying to do what's right. We liked it.",1463616000,5,2255,4.567164179104478
