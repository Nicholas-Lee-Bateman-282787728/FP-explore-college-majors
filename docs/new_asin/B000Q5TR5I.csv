I am a die-hard Rajesh Khanna fan so of course that was an added incentive. He looks great and has acted with quite some restraint ( he does tend to overact sometimes or go theatrical but not in this movie) and looks downright sexy without trying to. Hemamalini looks georgeous and has really good chemistry with Rajesh in this movie. The songs are great and flow with the story. People growing up with postman delivering mail will specially connect with the story since Rajesh as a postman is the backbone of the story. Great performances by all and worth multiple re-watches at least for me.",1371427200,,833,4.751724137931035
