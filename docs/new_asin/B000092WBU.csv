1876915,5,B000092WBU,"This movie I saw back in the 80's. I loved that he fell in love with this girl that had high morals. He protected her. A very important man wanted her out of the way. He was to kill her, but he innocent she was protect her from other hit men. It was a good story and it kepted you interested.",1386115200,,292,3.80327868852459
1876916,3,B000092WBU,"This is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I have always liked William Forsythe so
I thought I would take a chance on this movie. The film has a decent story-line with Forsythe
playing a hitman with second thoughts about his last job. Forsythe is good in the role
as is George Segal playing his boss. I was not impressed with Jo Champa in the female lead.
She's not much of a actress. This is not bad for the VOD rental price but there are quite
a few other films with the same story-line which are much better.",1287878400,,516,4.17
1876917,3,B000092WBU,"Direct Hit (1994) In the late 80's and early 90's, a production company called PM Entertainment turned out a slew of usually avoidable horror and action flicks direct to video. As time wore on, their product did improve in quality though. Case in point, this actioner starring William Forsythe (Stone Cold). Forsythe, a very recognizable bad guy in countless action movies, gets to strut his stuff as the lead here. He's a burned out hit man named Hatch working for a faceless government agency, and he's desperate to retire. When his last assignment turns out to be an attractive and innocent young woman, he instead takes her on the run, with his employer's other thugs in hot pursuit. Forsythe is an interesting choice for the protagonist, with his less-than-chiseled body and non-leading-man looks, and he is very good as the heartless killer trying to find his soul. I don't want to make this seem like a deep thought film or anything. It's a popcorn movie that knows how to blow stuff up real good. If you like that kind of entertainment, give this one a try. Also with Richard Norton (China O'Brien) and George Segal (Look Who's Talking).",1232755200,,1145,4.787878787878788
1876918,2,B000092WBU,"Most of what comes about during this action melodrama is precisely what must be expected, given the rather ordinary pedigrees of those responsible, in a narrative of John Hatch (William Forsythe), an assassin for the CIA whose activities unaccountably seem to be confined to stateside assignments. Presumably recognizing after a lengthy career that his original aspirations for patriotic service have been mislayed due to the callous aspects of his occupation, Hatch has determined that he will retire from the life of a ""hit man"". Compelled by CIA chieftain James Tronson (George Segal) to implement one last murder more than he desires, Hatch stalks his designated target: Savannah (Jo Champa) who purportedly is blackmailing a public figure, a former CIA director who is campaigning for a position of U.S. Senator. Having had the precepts he once believed in buried by the nature of his activities Hatch decides, in an attempt to partially redeem himself, not to complete his obligation but instead protects Savannah from the Agency after discovering that she is a victim of governmental deception and not an extortioner. Forsythe, a true original, performs his role as well as he can under the circumstances, and with his wonted low-key manner, here marked with a more than usual emphasis upon throatily aspirating his lines. He can, however, be heard and understood, a condition not consistently achieved in this production wherein the dubbing is often misaligned and the editing is uneven, manifest despite all of the violent proceedings. The script is nearly totally nonsensical as Forsythe, whose physique resembles an outhouse, magically evades hundreds of rounds fired directly at him by CIA operatives and others, while finding the time to demonstrate his need for a new plan of living by bedding rangy and sensuous Savannah in a mild scene (he is thankfully not in the buff) composed more of nuzzling and nibbling than the customary thrashing about - his cinematic force rests in his quietly ominous demeanor, not often tinged with a stripe of vulnerability.",1116892800,3,2070,5.2192192192192195
1876919,5,B000092WBU,"DIRECT HIT effectively returns audiences to one of Hollywood's
best genres: the cat and mouse game.  The movie reminds us that
flesh and blood adversaries, who display both motives and emotions, are more interesting to watch than the flanks of computer generated combatants populating big studio action flicks. ""Hit"" is a worthy diversion from all that blockbuster noise.  Ensemble work by an excellent cast also makes a notable
difference and gives this film its compelling quality.  William
Forsythe is John Hatch, a hit man with one last assignment from
the Agency before his retirement.  He falls for his target, a
woman questionably charged with bribing a senator, and becomes
her protector.  Hatch's boss (George Segal) dispatches another
agent, played by Richard Norton, to clean up the mess. In a smartly acted bar room scene, Norton admonishes Forsythe, ""You
turned your target into people.  Can't do that.""  Fans do not
need a reminder that Norton ranks among the best actors in action dramas and thrillers.  Even so, Norton's finely nuanced performance in ""Direct Hit"" delivers another example of the remarkable skill and energy he consistently brings to the screen with every role.",1062374400,5,1193,5.209424083769633
1876920,4,B000092WBU,"The first scene is so stupid, I almost turned it off, but I stuck around to see Forsythe. Today's action heroes have to wipe out whole armies of bad guys without getting a scratch, and destroy lots of property. This movie is no exception. Forsythe is a hit-man with a heart of gold, unable to kill his target because she has a child. You have to believe that all this mayhem is caused by a 10-year-old photograph and that even though the  woman's child has been kidnapped, she spends the night in bed with the hit-man. I had to watch this movie twice to appreciate it, but Forsythe makes a likeable unlikely hero.",979603200,3,613,4.424778761061947
