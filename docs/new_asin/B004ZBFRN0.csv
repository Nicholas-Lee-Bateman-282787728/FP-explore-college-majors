The characters are flat and the movie just sort of rolls along through the plot points without ever giving the audience a reason to care.",1325376000,2,542,6.337837837837838
4507623,4,B004ZBFRN0,"This has been compared to `Made in Dagenham', but I think this is actually much better and whilst they both deal with female empowerment, this one just oozes style. It stars Catherine Deneuve as Suzanne Pujol, who is the trophy wife of Robert. He married her and got her fathers umbrella factory as a dowry, employing three hundred workers. He then became a misogynistic stereo type of the bullying kind that epitomised the early seventies.

His negative attitude spills over to industrial relations and sets him on a collision course with the unions at his factory. They do a wild cat strike, he intervenes and after much wrangling he is released. This is done with the aid of the Communist Mayor, one Maurice Babin (Gerard Depardieu). All of the attention, and it must be said womanising finally catches up with Robert and he has a collapse. In the power vacuum that ensues, Suzanne steps in and takes over.

Set in 1977, there are some great period details, despite IMDB claiming a couple of gaffs like using a song from Bacarra that was not out until 1978, not really a deal breaker. It is beautifully filmed and directed by Franois Ozon (`Swimming Pool' and `8 women'). We soon discover that Suzanne is a `woman with a past' which makes up for her dumb blond performance at the beginning. This `past' includes the Mayor Maurice. I must say that there is genuine on screen chemistry between Deneuve and Depardieu, but he always seems to be able to pull it off (no pun intended).

There are also sub plots involving the children, a sideways dive into politics and some good comic asides. This though is not a full on comedy, it is a warm gentle film, with a feel good factor that sweeps you along. All of the performances are top notch especially from Fabrice Luchini who plays Robert. He is sexist, manipulating, a bully and yet I could not help but find him absolutely genuine and quite funny.

It has the perfect run time of an hour and a half, and some great musical asides too, but to say anymore may be a plot spoiler. I saw the trailer for this and decided I would not rush to see it, but this is one of those rare exceptions where the film is miles better than the trailer even hinted at, very nearly five stars, highly recommended, cest une triomphe!",1322179200,2,2262,4.5503685503685505
4507624,5,B004ZBFRN0,It's so great to watch a movie that just relies on a funny/great story  line that was so 1970's and great acting instead of loads of special effects. We really loved this movie and have lent it to many of our friends who have made the same comments. Hollywood should bring on more movies of this calibre and get back to the basics.,1319155200,2,331,4.253968253968254
4507625,4,B004ZBFRN0,"Loved this little movie. Catherine Deneuve was as lovely as ever, and tapped into the sometimes denied inner businesswoman desires of a ""traditional housewife"". Relevant for many of us.",1314748800,,185,5.413793103448276
4507626,4,B004ZBFRN0,"I am already a fan of Francois Ozon, so I expected I would like this film, and indeed I did.  Ozon has a very light touch, and although he also makes serious films, I see him as a master of comedy.  Throughout his works I can see the influence, visually and in terms of humour, of Pedro Almodovar and the later-phase John Waters.  Like Almodovar, Ozon's sets are always impeccably and artistically done, with a fantastic sense of color and good taste.  The actors are well-cast and well-utilized in their roles; I especially enjoyed Deneuve, whose portrayal makes use of that light touch that she and Ozon seem to have in common.  The look of the ""Potiche"" is often similar to that of Ozon's comedy ""8 Women"" that also features fabulously extravagant interiors.

Besides Deneuve--Gerard Depardieu, Fabrice Luchini, Karen Viard, Judith Godreche, and Jeremie Renier are standouts as well.  The excellent score is done in a style reminiscent of 1970's sitcoms, although not specifically in the American sense.  As Madame Pujol's son Laurent, Jeremie Renier is a strangely effeminate supposedly straight guy; it's as if Ozon had him portray the role in this way to play up yet another campy aspect of the film.  I found end of the picture to be quite moving, as Madame Pujol finally achieves her ultimate liberation and expresses her love and support for the community she has always been a part of.  The final scene features Madame Pujol singing, 'C'est Beau La Vie""; at this point, she seems to be Catherine Deneuve as much as she is her character; but it doesn't matter, and the entire effect brought tears to my eyes.  Ozon has a way of making comedies that initially seems superficial and silly, but by the end of the film one becomes aware of a sub-textual rigour as well.

The DVD also includes the 1 hour and 11 minute ""Making of Potiche"" that  provides insight into Ozon's working methods, who appears to be even-tempered and generally smiling.  The actors also seem to be enjoying themselves on the set.  This documentary also gives one hints of the various actors' off-screen personalities; Depardieu is constantly ""on"" and making jokes, almost to the point of being obnoxious; Karen Viard complains the glasses that ""uglify"" her in her role as Nadege, the sexy secretary; Jeremy Renier often looks uncomfortable, although trying to hide this with good humour; the rest of the cast remains relatively low-key.

4507627,4,B004ZBFRN0,"This film is a very clever amusing watch.  Not the best comedy ever. Not even up to LEGALLY BLONDE, by my taste.  But very enjoyable, and Catherine Deneuve is always a joy to watch.  Well worth watching. Rent, don't buy. You won't want to see it again, I suspect.",1309046400,5,263,4.326530612244898
4507628,5,B004ZBFRN0,"Potiche pretends to be silly and lighthearted while being rife with undercurrents that threaten to provide deeper meaning to the story. This is colorful and goofy with acting that approaches broad, then withdraws at the verge as if to regard whether the audience is paying attention. At the lead is Catherine Deneuve (Suzanne), who skillfully plays a smart character that has become accustomed to playing dumb all her life. `Potiche' refers to the trophy wife that she has become, married to a ignorant and arrogant man (Robert) who rules an umbrella factory as his own private fiefdom. The factory was built and run for years by Suzanne's father, but he seems to think it was his creation all along. The workers at the umbrella factory strike, Robert storms the protest to give them a good verbal lashing - and is taken hostage. Suzanne is left to negotiate as the head of the factory in his absence with the help of Maurice (Gerard Depardieu), the socialist mayor. While styled as a quick-witted farce, Potiche is filled with conflicting passions. The socialists and capitalists are at each others' throats, men and women battle for financial supremacy (always thinly veiled sexual warfare), and numerous themes regarding globalization, sexual liberation, and gender roles play a supporting part. First and foremost, it is a comedy, and it is a sharp one at that.

Suzanne is the very picture of still waters, though she is none too deep throughout Potiche. She writes simple and silly poems, jogs, and ignores her husband's clumsy infidelities. She is not stupid, however, just bored. Her husband does not have her fooled, for example, since she just prefers to let other women service the idiot with whom she shares the house. This is where Deneuve shows why she is one of the greatest of actresses - her arc is a practical one, and when given power she runs with it, and it never feels like a false one imbued with informed attributes. Her children do not seem to recognize her abilities, openly mocking her with their assumptions of her simplicity. He daughter Joelle remarks ""I do not want to end up like you"", with no malice intended. Well, Suzanne just has nothing better to do at the moment. When the strike occurs, she eventually becomes an effective negotiator after considerable trial and error. Maurice is on hand to lend his support, though mostly out of affection for Suzanne, as they shared love once. Robert is thick from start to finish, never accepting the notion that his wife could actually run the factory effectively, though he is correct that she would be incapable of his ruthlessness.

While this sounds like a 9 to 5 remake (sans the awesome douchebaggery of Dabney Coleman), Francois Ozon is careful to maintain a tone of breezy silliness. Make no mistake, there is an iron grip on the production, and the tale is meticulously crafted while appearing to take nothing about itself seriously. Potiche is deeply derisive about traditional gender roles, mocks capitalism as only a Frenchman can, and is free to drop acidic dialogue whenever possible. Suzanne is a demure housewife, but this mold is hilariously broken as we get to know her more closely. As the flashbacks begin to pile up with her copulations, and she starts to forget just who she was servicing at any one time, it becomes a joke in itself. The most traditional woman is her daughter Joelle, who is herself a parody of virulently conservative radical women who feel women belong in the home and men belong in the office, holding a bullwhip to use on cheeky employees as often as possible. Robert is a traditional man, and inherits the factory but acts as though he built it. This is a sly play on free market conservatives who are confused by the notion that there is more to success than work. He has his fun with the secretary (who hates him anyway), but Suzanne could not give a toss, her own infidelities committed out of joie de vivre rather than something as insipid as revenge.

The film is set in the 1970s amidst a time of economic turmoil, though the subject of globalization (Joelle proposes moving the factory to North Africa) renders the period moot. The issues involved in Potiche are timeless, and perhaps one of the points to be made would be that one must always be adaptable, if not always capable. Suzanne is as egalitarian in her political and fiscal leanings as her sexual conquests, while Maurice appears to be running out of steam. He changes little throughout the film, and it is suggested that perhaps one's political bent should be either flexible or it had better be disposable.

This is a busy film, and one gets the impression that Francois Ozon is constantly messing with you. I appreciate that sentiment, as his best films (Swimming Pool, 52) struggle mightily to move the goalposts and deny the audience a comfortable seat. In this, I likely missed some important themes and clever jokes that slid by me, as I was captivated by the enormous sense of humor at the core of Potiche. That, and the flawless and immensely relaxed performances by Deneuve and Depardieu, who inhabit their characters and make acting look easy.",1307750400,34,5144,4.8156108597285066

4507669,2,B004ZBFRN0,"After watching what seemed half an hour of a 1970's TV show, I told myself to keep on watching because I was sure there would be a twist to all the clichs. However, after an hour, the film lasts an hour and a half, I gave up watching ""Potiche"". Two stars for the acting, which was very good at portraying dated, stereotyped characters from the 1970's, and the cinematography, which is also state of the art.

During the entire hour I managed to watch, ""The Brady Bunch Movie"", with its silly sexual innuendos and Women's Liberation theme, came to my mind. In fact, I think ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" had a more complex plot despite its vast array of clichs. What's the problem with ""Potiche""? Everything was dated: from the score to the plot. If Mr. Ozon wanted to honor 1970's films, he could have done it in a more original way, maybe with a twist or ""reinventing"" the genre. I mean, even the ""Bewitched"" remake with Nicole Kidman had a new perspective.

Of course, ""Potiche"" is French and Catherine Deneuve and Grard Depardieu are its stars, so this means that it is considered a great film. If this film had been made by an unknown director and it featured a cast of unknown actors, I know that it would have been slashed and dismissed immediately. After having watched other engaging films by Franois Ozon, like ""Ricky"", ""The Refuge"" and ""Swimming Pool"", I cannot believe ""Potiche"" was made by the very same director.",1365724800,2,1419,4.604743083003952

Both shine as superstars which does not necessarily translate to well to American audiences unfortunately.  They are France's equivalent to Streep & DeNiro.  The story was, however, lightweight and  more of a nostalgia film for these two French co-superstars.  I loved watching them together anyway!  Fabrice Luchini is really the one who stole the movie as the overbearing factory owner and husband to Ms. Deneuve.  He was hysterical and his comedic timing was fabulous which infused life into a borderline dull movie.  I was a teenager in 1977 and wore the same kind of clothes in the movie--which at the time thought were so cool!!!",1357257600,,789,5.007692307692308

Imagine the lightness of Legally Blonde combined with the ambivalent humanity of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, blended into a mature (and somewhat subversive) sex comedy.

I love light comedy, and Potiche has the light-comic flavor... but the underlying stories surrounding the film's central marriage-in-crisis reveal funny and interesting people who appear intensely conventional yet reveal lives which defy expectation and pulse with messy truth.

This film is the oddest combination of heart-warming comfort food and taboo-stretching sexual innuendo which paints a rather thought-provoking portrait of some deeply flawed but intensely human, sympathetic people. I rather loved this film, but it is very strange... in part because it presents itself as being utterly conventional, just as its characters seem to be at first... until the film is over and you're sitting there, wondering what hit you. This is not a perfect movie by any means, but if you like light comedies which portray frank, human sexuality and human relationships in all their complicated glory, you will probably enjoy this picture.",1338076800,,1395,5.5754716981132075
4507679,4,B004ZBFRN0,"We had planned to see this film at a local theater but it was so far away that we would have missed the first part of the movie.  I checked on Amazon and found it for rent.  We streamed it to our laptop and watched it on our flatscreen TV with an HDMI hook-up.  The beginning started out blurry but it cleared almost immediately and was so clear that it was possible to read the very small credits at the end of the film.  The film streamed seamlessly, although we never tried to pause and resume it.  The story was very enjoyable.  Catherine Deneuve was gorgeous, as usual and the French subtitles were reasonably easy to read.  It was nice to find the exact film we wanted to see at a very affordable price and to watch it in the comfort of our home.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Potiche/dp/B005DD7MDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Potiche</a>",1337817600,,888,5.0

4507681,3,B004ZBFRN0,"Amusing comedy with Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu. Nice storyline that seems to fall apart at the end. Why did Suzanne decide to run for office - opposite Maurice? Did she want to see him more often through work? or was it just a way to state her independence after losing control of the company to her husband? If to prove her independence, why strike out at the man who had helped her and with whom she had a love interest? What was the purpose of the cute young man flirting with Laurent? Why hint at his possible homosexual affair at the end when there was no basis for it in the movie? What was the meaning of the song at the end and why did Maurice smile when he heard Suzanne sing it? Enjoyable but too many unanswered questions at the end.",1332460800,,756,4.293706293706293
4507682,5,B004ZBFRN0,"This movie is packaged as a silly insight into french society during the 1970s, but it does more than that. It offers a critique of the assumptions that society relied upon to treat women in the manner they did. In doing so, the movie uses a light hearted script and excellent cast to weave the tale of a poor housewife who is not taken seriously by anyone, but her son and one time lover. The movie reveals how she fights these assumptions and is able to overcome the low expectations people place upon her. But it does not do it too seriously and still makes its point. All in all, a very good movie.",1330560000,,602,4.2894736842105265
4507683,4,B004ZBFRN0,"It is 1977 and Suzanne Pujol has been a stay at home wife for the last 30 years, her husband Robert Pujol runs a famous umbrella factory (owned by Suzanne's father). Her daughter aspires to work whilst her son shows no interest in the family business. But things are about to change when strike action hits the factory and Madame Pujol steps up to take charge of the ailing umbrella business. She finds an unlikely ally in the communist mayor Babin played by the excellent Gerard Depardieu.

This gentle, intelligent comedy has a lightness of being and the period detail works beautifully throughout as does the highly accomplished cast who work well together with Deneuve shining brightly among them.

If you are looking for a french farce with feeling, look no further. Potiche is a delightful movie and well worth a watch!",1328313600,,825,4.802816901408451
4507684,4,B004ZBFRN0,"'Potiche' (meaning, approximately, 'trophy wife') is an enjoyable and, in fact, educational light comedy period piece from writer/director, Franois Ozon.  Ozon, creator of 2003's intriguing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swimming-Pool-Unrated-Version/dp/B00005JMIJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swimming Pool (Unrated Version)</a>&nbsp;(Charlotte Rampling and a very unforgettable Ludivine Sagnier), has here styled a mid-sixties tale of business and family and the way things used to be.  Ozon's Potiche is the ageless Catherine Deneuve, a true international treasure.  She's a trophy wife in the original sense: not a young, second wife hottie, but rather the first wife and the daughter of a successful industrialist whose lucky husband has married into the family and taken over the firm.  Deneuve's Suzanne Pujol is expected to stay home and tend to house, home and family.

The tables are turned when Mme. Pujols' husband, an obstreperous, conceited corporate hack played with delicious, over-the-top perfection by the great actor, Fabrice Luchini (along other physical comedic delights, he executes a perfect 'spit take' here), is taken prisoner in an oh-so-French way by his fed-up workstaff.  That's a storyline that maintains immediacy through at least 2008 when a wave of these events swept France.  Through a series of machinations, Suzanne ends up taking control of the firm.  And, lo and behold, she's a far superior manager to her husband in every manner...investing in human capital, fostering good relations with her employees and recognizing - with the able assistance of her artist son - the importance of design and originality in products.  Suddenly, the firm's umbrella factory is turning out not just utilitarian, functioning rain repellents, but bold, personal statements and fashion pieces.  It's a story that has relevance through today.

Through another series of machinations, husband Robert turns the tables on Suzanne and reasserts control of the firm.  Suzanne's tack?  An unexpected - and unexpectedly successful - turn into politics.  Using the same flair and verve that reinvigorated the family firm, she embarks on a campaign to win voters over one at a time.  She does this at the expense of local functionary - and one-time lover - Grard Depardieu, here cast in dual roles as labor leader and local left-leaning MP.  [I do wish filmmakers would back off the romantic interludes featuring the increasingly unromantic-looking Mr. Depardieu.  I realize his charm is legendary, but his Andie McDowell-wooing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Card/dp/B00008977F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Card</a>&nbsp;days are distant history.]

One scene that had me clapping my hands with delight: Ms. Deneuve - left on the side of the road by a miffed Mr. Depardieu - hitchhikes and is picked up by a trucker heading back to town.  There in the driver's seat: wordless, smiling, supremely content Sergi Lpez, the sublime, quadralingual Catalonian actor. Touch, M. Ozon!",1327708800,,3083,5.918735891647856
