8634973,5,B00HRUQ9N8,A great education purchase for my class. SOme times you need a different approach to teach to students. These videos give my students a glimps of animals they have not been able to see especially in the wild.,1531008000,,208,4.5
8634974,2,B00HRUQ9N8,Rather cheesy and a little disturbing; focused way too much on whether the predator could kill humans rather than just showing it in its natural habitat,1522281600,,152,4.884615384615385

8634977,5,B00HRUQ9N8,another superb national geographic special,1490313600,,42,7.6
8634978,3,B00HRUQ9N8,"I agree with Charlie, a previous reviewer.  Contains a lot of scientific explanations and computer animation, but not too much action. I prefer wildlife DVDs such as Eternal Enemies, Relentless Enemies, and Crocodiles: Here Be Dragons. This is what I expect from National Geographic-dramatic, nonstop footage with the species in their natural habitats and nothing but.",1468195200,,368,5.571428571428571

8634981,3,B00HRUQ9N8,"so far, i saw the first disc - about cats and constrictor snakes. this is about how predators kill - what tools G-d gave them (of course without mentioning His name). there is very little full, uninterrupted footage of these animals in action. it's about the claws, the teeth, muscle, bla bla, with brief clips backing up those facts. wierdly, the main footage about lions, tigers, and anacondas are of attacks on humans! (unclear, of course.) if you want this, it's for you.being that i wasn't looking for this, i was disappointed.",1436745600,5,532,4.793478260869565
