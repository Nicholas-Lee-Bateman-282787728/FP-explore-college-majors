4330976,5,B004CZRE7Q,I loved watching the series of Hart to Hart with  both Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers and the late Lional Stander. So when I saw the Return to Hart to Hart Returns was available it was a great treat...to be able to see them altogether one more time. So if you were or never saw the orginal series this is a real treat to see how they have acheive the same quality as they did earlier.,1299369600,22,388,4.105263157894737

4330981,5,B004CZRE7Q,"I think this is my favorite of the last one made. The trip to the mountains for alone time and getting away , riding horses that both actors love  was great. But to see the house burn was horrible I cry every time, I guess it was never rebuilt, it was beautiful. But above all I loved the ending it was terrific!!! ",1426204800,,315,4.064516129032258

4330987,5,B004CZRE7Q,Love this movie!,1407196800,,16,4.666666666666667
4330988,5,B004CZRE7Q,Love Stephanie Powers and everything she does.  Had to get these just because.  I get in a mood for simple entertainment and this is wonderful.,1389571200,,143,4.68
4330989,3,B004CZRE7Q,This one was ok because I don't think it was as good as the series show. But if you like seeing the couple in action again it's worth buying and watching at least once or twice. I liked the orginal show so I wanted to see all the additonal movies as well. It's too bad the show ended.,1389052800,,284,3.913793103448276
4330990,5,B004CZRE7Q,This video is of great quality and is economically priced. I enjoyed every minute of it. I've watched it more than once. The series brought back a lot of memories.  I recommend it.,1382486400,3,180,4.454545454545454
4330991,3,B004CZRE7Q,"Sony Pictures Entertainment is releasing now all the TV movies on DVD-R's. That the movies are coming is the good point.

Also its nice to see the Harts AND Max 10 years later after ending the Serie (I don't understand why they didn't have released all 5 Season on DVD - the show is very entertaining and fun with very good dialogues).

The picture quality is so far good and also the sound. The most dissapointing is, ther're no SUBTITLES (english) included which makes for me a little difficult to understand (because little bit hard hearing and foreign speaking).

FAZIT: the ""return"" is a very nice movie (i liked it)  and has any nice guest stars but in my mind: every dvd needs subtitles (even it would be only english!!!!)

P.S. i met Stefanie Powers last year in London during her ""Lorenz""-Hart-Tour (she was very charming and nice and had a nice chat with her) and she signed me this DVD Cover.",1366070400,5,903,4.549382716049383
4330992,3,B004CZRE7Q,"I was wanting to see what this 20 year return would be like, expecting ""more of the same"".
That proved fairly true, but pretty good. The plot was not all that grabbing, I think it could have been done better.
But still a nice clean romantic adventure.",1365379200,,251,4.361702127659575
4330993,5,B004CZRE7Q,It has the same feel as the tv show and same actors for the characters. If you liked the series you would like the movie.,1363910400,,121,3.88
4330994,5,B004CZRE7Q,Had just what I expected. If more couples shared there life and love approach we would have less divorce. It is refreshing to see  couple still in love with each other. Even if it is just on tv. Gives us something to hope for in our own lives. The plot was very believable.,1358985600,2,273,4.150943396226415
4330995,3,B004CZRE7Q,Same as the above although I  wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it - Alright for light viewing on a rainy day!,1354147200,,115,3.7916666666666665
4330996,4,B004CZRE7Q,It was a lot of fun to see the Harts again.  Yes I own season 1 & 2 and yes I desperately want the remaining seasons released.  But this was fun to see.,1352073600,,152,3.5757575757575757
4330997,5,B004CZRE7Q,"The Harts always showed you the best side of people. That's what made the show such a hit. Love, kindness, togetherness, faith in each other and tenacity! They have it all in each show. Especially this one! What happened to them only made them stronger; if that's possible.",1340409600,5,273,4.708333333333333
4330998,5,B004CZRE7Q,"After a break of over a decade it is great to see Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner team up with Lionel Stander (Max) as the Hart couple in the first of these 90 minute film length mysteries. Just like the TV series, the couple end up in all sorts of escapades.
Good to return to some decent TV shows from the early 80s.",1340236800,7,320,4.095238095238095
4330999,5,B004CZRE7Q,"I love to watch the series- I bought the first two and watched them so many times that my kids and I try to find flaws in each episode.  It you watch the the Vail episode ""Down Hill to Death"" when Jennifer is riding up the ski lift- one slide she is holding her ski poles, the next slide she has them under her leg- also, have you noticed the ""finger prints"" on the mirror she's looking into at the opening of each episode! We love the show!
I bought a chinese version that has the rest of the seasons but the picture quality is very poor and skips but I can still manage to get a few episodes out of it.  I was hoping Netflicks and the like would sign a deal.  That's the way it's going now, I dought they will product CD's but I see a big following...Magium PI and Remmington Steel are also favs- I love the 80's!",1323388800,6,815,4.018518518518518
4331000,5,B004CZRE7Q,"I loved ""Hart to Hart Returns""  I have the first two seasons and six of the eight movies that were made.  I loved them all.  I am very anxious for seasons three,four,five, and the last two movies to be released.  When will season three be released?  I am a huge fan of Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner. I have Ms Powers book ""One from the Hart"".  I could not put it down.",1322179200,,372,4.097222222222222
4331001,4,B004CZRE7Q,"Loved this return of our favourite detective couple! The chemistry between to 2 main charactures is as HOT as it was in the original series, and once you get used to the few grey hairs and wrinkles it like they never left our screens. Great Sunday afternoon chill out movie :o)",1320192000,,277,4.450980392156863
4331002,5,B004CZRE7Q,Very good quality DVD of one of my favorite 80's TV shows! Seeking to get all the episodes. Have to write more because this system refuses to accept only what I want to write!!!!!!!!!!,1317945600,,184,4.4411764705882355
4331003,4,B004CZRE7Q,"Do you have for us a contact email address of Sony where we can all post that we wanna have the rest of the Seasons???

I would like to tell them as well that I want to purchase the other seasons as well. I only have Season one and two. I want the others!!!  :-)",1311465600,7,262,3.7454545454545456
4331004,5,B004CZRE7Q,"What can I say the ""Return"" was like they never left. I really enjoyed the the story line and especially the last scene, true Hart to Hart sytle. The writers again captured the essence of what the series was really about love, adventure and mystery. The characters, Jonathan, Jennifer and the late Max is timeless. As a baby boomer this is what I call good television. There are very few good shows on today so I am finding myself going back to the 70's, 80's and 90's for good viewing pleasure. I watched the series when it aired '79-'84 I enjoyed it then I am thoroughly enjoying watching it even more now. While all us Hart to Hart fans are enjoying the movies made for TV they can't completely take the place of all the other seasons that have not been released yet. As I said in a previous review I am expressing again if you have any input please convey to Sony that we are anxiously awaiting Seasons 3-5 or atleast season 3. Release them and I guarantee they will be purchased.",1310947200,29,984,4.382513661202186

This is it . . . Why did they !  Dont bother",1309737600,,134,3.0303030303030303
4331006,5,B004CZRE7Q,"Releasing all 5 post series telefilms is a great thing to do BUT where are seasons 3,4,5 ?
 We only have seasons 1,2 and the post films so far.
 Please release the rest of the seasons so that we can complete our collection.",1302652800,34,223,4.162790697674419
