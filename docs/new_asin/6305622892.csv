1061594,4,6305622892,"The play is there, or most of it. It is funny and light, though a little bit too spectacular. Shakespeare requires and deserves some simplicity in the special effects to make the text more effective. The magic of the play is nevertheless with us : imbroglios, funny sexual innuendo, puns, etc. And of course the end is the triple wedding ceremony with a fourth one (Titania and Oberon) behind and a fifth one that gives a tragic vision of what happens when parents or social circumstances refuse love and impose fake weddings : this leads to death and it is the play in the play that is made funny by the inability of the amateur actors to perform tragedy and also by their creativity in having a wall played by a man and the moon replaced by a lantern held by the man in the moon, or even by ythe replacement of a roaring lion by a barking and biting poodle. Yet I am afraid that the transposition of the play into the finishing 19th century is kind of naive and also adds too many gadgets of the  modern  world, especially bikes. The result is too anecdotic and the humor is no longer on the situation among the young people, but too much in the use, abuse and misuse of these bikes. It also makes the dilemma of getting married with the man chosen by the father or getting executed or becoming a nun kind of silly and out of place because mostly impossible at the end of the 19th century. What's more the two couples of young people are supposed to be sixteen or seventeen in the play, children in a way, and they are obviously adults, too old for the part, too old to be that naive and fresh. Finally I am afraid that turning Puck into an old man is not a very good idea. He has to be inexperienced and innocently sloppy in his work, hence he has to be a very young fairy. Good entertainment in spite of all those negative rermarks.",1036022400,,1836,4.2881844380403455
1061595,4,6305622892,"asthetically, the movie was grand. The costumes and locations were beautiful. However, the acting didn't impress me. Tucci was a fine Puck, Pfeiffer a beautiful and regal Titania... but past those two, I was not wholly impressed. Little was done to at ALL express the characters of Demetrius and Lysander, I got no feel for them whatsoever in the movie... their characters did not show through at all. Hermia was wonderful, she played the role fabulously. Calista Flockhart, however, did not do the part of Helena justice. She whined throughout the whole thing, making Helena two dimensional and annoying. (although, I must say I'm rather critical of her because after being Helena in a play of MND myself, I've learned a lot)
Many important parts of the script were cut out, which left the play lacking in many important aspects. The direction was fair, at best. I absolutely love the play, therefore I do enjoy the movie, despite some of the mediocre acting.",1035590400,,960,4.895705521472393
1061596,2,6305622892,"This ambitious attempt to film the Shakespearean fantasy has much to recommend it, but in the end falters on the rocks of its own lack of imagination.  Director Michael Hoffman starts out promisingly, showing an interesting society of fairies living in the enchanted woods and depicting Puck riding around on a giant snail. But Robin Goodfellow quickly changes in his snail for a bicycle, and the film soon becomes as mundane as the sprightly elf's choice of transportation.
The performances are a frustrating mixed bag. Anna Friel's sexy and vulnerable Hermia is the undeniable standout in the cast, projecting such depth and humanity in a role that few actresses make much impact in that her depiction approaches the overused Shakespearean mantle of ""definitive."" Impressive turns are also offered by Roger Rees as a browbeaten Peter Quince, Bill Irwin as a surprisingly moving Snug, and Calista Flockhardt - who is well-cast and effective as Helena, although her whiney characterization is so reminiscent of her TV turn as Ally MacBeal that it was difficult for this viewer to suspend my disbelief to the point where I could fully accept her in the role.
Coming off less well are David Strathairn, who gives such a low-key and flavorless performance as Theseus that the viewer wonders if he was told that the cameras were on when he was playing his scenes; Rupert Everett who offers little more than a stiff line recitation as Oberon; and Stanley Tucci as Puck, who was a victim of director Hoffman's inability to use any cinematic magic to make the character come off as anything approaching fairylike.
Special mention should be made to the producer's casting coups of Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer. Kline, of course, is widely regarded as the finest American Shakespearean actor of his generation and his reputation as a farceur makes his casting as Bottom seem inspired. But Kline not only offers a disappointingly lifeless characterization, but Hoffman made a fatal error in trying to ""flesh out"" the part by making him a hen-pecked husband who is constantly trying to avoid a shrewish wife that was never anything Shakespeare imagined: indeed Hoffman quarantines her from the other characters by writing her dialogue in Italian, a clumsy device that only serves to make the aberration seem like even more of a sore thumb.
But unquestionably the low point of the film is the incompetent performance of Pfeiffer as Titania. Her delivery of the Shakespearian dialogue is so unconvincing that she comes off as a performer in a high school play. It's time that producers realized that casting ""movie names"" like Pfeiffer, Keanu Reeves, Ethan Hawke and Jack Lemmon in classical roles that they are ill-equipped to play may help them raise the budgets for their projects, but it ultimately sinks the artistic aspirations of the endeavor.
But for all its faults, this ""Midsummer"" is almost redeemed by a magnificent rendering of the ""Pyramus and Thisby"" play-within-a-play in Act V. This is actor-proof material, to be sure; but the players depicting the Mechanicals as well as the Lovers supporting them in the audience do a miraculous job of playing the scene for both its farcical elements and for the very dramatic moments that lie just beneath the text.  If the entire film had been played at this level, it might have been one of the great masterpieces of Shakespeare on film; but as it is, it is little more than patchwork.",1020038400,,3434,4.980836236933798
1061597,5,6305622892,"Midsummer's Night Dream was my first introduction to Shakespeare, and I have never forgotten it.  I loved it from the start.  In this version the time is changed (I don't generally like modern settings of Shakespeare, but this one is acceptable), and the acting is great.
Kevin Kline is outstanding as Bottom, and adds so much depth to this character.  Tucci is great as Puck, and Calista Flockhart turns in a decent performance as Helena.  The special effects add a lot, as it is, after all, a fairy kingdom.  The play within the play is outrageously funny and unexpectly touching. Still, it is the portayal of the characters that make this production outstanding.  It adds a certain tenderness to the play that I never fully realized before.",1018224000,,743,4.811023622047244
1061598,2,6305622892,"I watched my video of the 1999 film of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" together with borrowed videos of the 1969 and 1935 versions, and the comparisons were very interesting.  I was surprised to find that I liked the 1935 film the best of the three (except for the tacky Korngold intrusions on Mendelssohn's incidental music) and the 1999 version the least.  I feel that removing a play from its original time and place is largely a ticket-selling gimmick and distorts the original cultural and emotional context.  Nick Bottom in a city-slicker suit just doesn't work for me.  And 16th-century expressions of Celtic/Anglo-Saxon fairy lore don't  have any place in 19th-century Greco-Latin/Catholic Italy.  The soundtrack was a jarring mish-mosh of musical styles obviously intended to sell CD's.  And Stanley Tucci as an oversized, middle-aged Puck?!  (No one, not even Ian Holm, can come close to Mickey Rooney in that role.)  However, I did think that the poignance of Flute's speech in his Thisbe role was the high point of this version -- a very touching departure from the usual broad comedy of the play-within-a-play -- and it's the only reason I'm not getting rid of my video.  (Similarly, the best part by far of the 1969 Peter Hall TV movie was the play-within-a-play and the Nick Bottom role in it.)",1018051200,,1305,4.917808219178082
1061599,1,6305622892,"I tried with all my heart to like this movie.  I really did.  I thought with a cast like that, how could you miss?  With characters so vivid and bold and an array of talent that included Kline, Pfeiffer, Tucci, et al, this was bound to be a sure winner.  WRONG!  This wonderful cast fought valiantly against absurd, misguided and egomaniacal direction that paid little tribute -- much less attention -- to Shakespeare.  Hoffman is so interested in leaving his own personal stamp on the piece that he ignores the delightful story itself.  I am not such a traditionalist that I require a play to be done the same way by everyone. Indeed, I have been known to take some artistic license in the productions I have directed.  But I always try to maintain the integrity of the play's spirit.  Hoffman could definitely use a heathy dose of Branagh lessons.  Thank heavens Mickey Rooney and James Cagney committed ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" to film.  At least those of us who love Shakespeare have someplace to go. Hoffman's star-studded pastiche is an utter waste of great talent, an unjustified personal indulgence in absolute directoral power (which corrupted absolutely)and an assault on every Bardophile.

1061600,5,6305622892,"As a Shakepeare fan and English major, I often cringe at the Hollywood versions of Shakepeare plays. I thought (along with Hollywood screenwriters, evidently) that the American public, your average Joe wouldn't want to sit through a lot of thee's and thou's. But this is both a stunning visual adaptation and surprisingly true to the text. The casting is also stellar! Michelle Pfeiffer is luminous as the fairy queen Titania, and Rupert Everett as her Oberon is mouth-wateringly sexy. Kevin Kline is laugh-out-loud funny as Bottom the Weaver, wearing the donkey ears surprisingly well for someone of natural dignity and poise. He also delivers a new poignancy to the end, when he recalls the dream just past with heart-breaking longing and a real sense of loss. I admit, I was critical of ""Ally McBeal"" star Calista Flockhart as Helena (who was supposed to be exceedingly tall), but she also delivers a wonderful performance of dispair and frustration. Chistian Bale's capability to be so magnetically sexy (when under loves spell and even before, when threatening Helena) never ceases to amaze me. Puck (Stanley Tucci) proves both impish and critical (""What fools these mortals be""). The addition of computerized special effects, instead of distracting from the action, add a new depth and wonder to the scenes. The viewer is truly transported to a world of fairy magic and Midsummer Madness.",1010966400,,1394,5.118421052631579
1061601,3,6305622892,"While I don't have a problem with new interpretations of Shakespeare, I didn't find this all that new, just confused.  Updating Shakespeare is also fine, if it serves a purpose, or at least doesn't interfere with the story, but those bicycles were ridiculous, and simply not funny.  There was no point of reference, no reason for them to be there, no punchline.  Likewise with Helena and Hermia's little mudbath...generally, the direction was absolutely horrible.  The film is quite entertaining though, thanks to some very hard work from some of the cast.  And that does not mean Calista Flockhart and Michelle Pfieffer (C.F. is grating, and M.P. obviously not comfortable with the text).  It means Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, and Rupert Everett among the stars, but especially to some of the secondary characters: Anna Friel as a grounded Hermia (mud bath excepted) Sophie Marceau as an actually likeable Hyppolyta, and the great Roger Rees, as the most memorable Peter Quince I've ever seen.  The music is gorgeous, and the scenery is nice, although having actually taken the trouble to go to Tuscany, Hoffman decides to film the magical forest on a really horrible, cheesy, creaking sound stage.

I think that bycicle introduction is great and Sheakspear would have loved it. Besdies being close to text the film is just beautiful to see. This opus brought to my attention such a great actor as Kevin Kline who is different in every film he appears in.
Those who like great names will appreciate Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett, though the whole cast is super.
Great credit to the director! And a must for a Sheakspearan lover.",1003881600,,659,4.5
1061680,3,6305622892,"I can only give this a mixed review: it is a great play, after all, but the direction of this film is so clunky and heavy-handed that, if you aren't already familiar with the play you will wonder what all the fuss is about.  Of the cast, only the bumbling actor's troupe led by the great Kevin Kline makes any impression at all.  The exception is the excellent Calista Flockhart as Helena.  Some have complained that her performance is too similar to ""Ally McBeal.""  The two roles do depict young, insecure single women, but Flockhart makes something new and touching out of Helena.  She actually thinks she is ""ugly"" (something that would never occur to Ally)  and Flockhart does get across an awkward, spinsterish quality that is quite amusing.  Of the young lovers, all played by plastically pretty performers, Calista comes off as fully human.",998265600,,847,4.8

1061682,4,6305622892,this play was one of my least favorite of shakespeare's work mostly due to the terrible versions i had seen on the amateur stage. this film version brought back the beauty and the innocence and the dreams of love that are at the core of this play. herein lies some of shakespeare's most beautiful love poetry and a perfect example of his genius as a comic writer. the three main plot points are twined all together in a manner that is nothing short of delightful. a perfect movie that is wonderfully acted by all. my faith in the all-knowing bard is restored.,978566400,,559,4.490196078431373
1061683,4,6305622892,"If you're a Shakespearean purist, don't torture yourself by viewing this colorfully engaging version!  Some would say that Shakespeare should be presented as written and that one should not take ""liberties"" with the Bard.  Poppycock!  Bill Shakespeare was always one for taking ""liberties"" -- he almost single-handedly created much of the language we speak today.  He would probably have enjoyed the concept that modern-day actors and directors would take his works and bring them ""alive"" for their audiences.  The unfortunate reality is, however, that this version falls just short of doing that.
Kline and Tucci walk away with the best performances of the film and both help keep the story alive, humorous, and in-keeping with the tongue-in-cheek humor which Shakespeare obviously enjoyed.
For someone new to the storyline, especially younger viewers, the not-modern language will get in the way of fully understanding the story.  But even my youngest kids get much of the point and enjoy the story.  You and yours will too.  The show is a fine afternoon view -- allow yourself time to explain some of the obtuse points to your kids as you go.
A great movie to keep in your collection.

1061684,5,6305622892,"""Much Ado About Nothing "" with Kenneth Branaugh is much more true to Shakespeare. However, this film yields good things. Like ""Much Ado "" it was shot in Tuscany, Italy, the beautiful wood and village scenes taking the place of Shakespeare's original city of Athens. There are a lot of opera songs running throughout the movie, since Italian opera was a hit durin the nineteenth century, and so were LP's and bycycles all of which are featured in the film. It is definately a twist to the original version Shakespeare intended. But it's beautiful to see and hear. Top-notch performances by Calista Flockheart as Helena, Kevin Kline, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania the Fairy Queen. There's lots of great comic moments (like the mud fight) and the soundtrack is gorgeous. Must see for Shakespeare fans, or fans of Pfeiffer and Flockheart. I give it a deserving five stars. I viewed it twice and loved the film.",972864000,,909,4.833333333333333
1061685,3,6305622892,"A Midsummer Night's Dream by the great William Shakespear enjoys a reprisal in this lavish American production. The movie's strong points are its rich costumes, beautiful music, and pretty decent acting. However, this is not enough to offset its weak points. These include nearly incomprehensible, and if I may be pardoned for this, phony acents; historical anarchronisms, and the lack of connection between the first part of the movie (the love story) and the second part (the performance of the play at the royal palace). Although the acting is polished, I somehow lacked the feeling of sympathy for the characters: they just did not convince me their emotions were genuine. This movie is neither a classic adaptation of Shakespear, nor a classic in its own right, but is definitely scores points for the magnificence of its production",971049600,,837,5.116788321167883

1061687,2,6305622892,"Can Shakespeare's most magical play stand having all the magic taken out if there are at least pretty people playing the parts? I'm sorry, but no. Some have complained about the mud fights and nudity that pervade the film,  which are not really a problem in a convention-defying play such as this,  but every major role is so miscast as to make this movie nearly  unwatchable.
The main culprit is Calista Flockhart, who has to stop  McBealing her way through every role she gets. Stanley Tucci does an  adequate job of acting but physically is about the last person who should  play Puck. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett do a fair job as Titania  and Oberon, but as usual it's Kevin Kline who chews up the Tuscan scenery  and steals the show with gusto.
The worst mistake for a movie about  enchantment is to be mediocre and ordinary. You just won't remember this  ""Dream"" for very long after it's over.",961286400,,908,4.61875

1061689,4,6305622892,"This is not the best version of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM out there.  Once again, for some strange reason, it has been decided that Shakespeare didn't know what he was doing, and actually, the setting for the film is Italy,  not Athens.  And as the film opens we discover that characters like  Hippolyta (Queen of the Amazons) and Theseus (Duke of Athens) actually live  in a 19th century villa.  Rather remarkable, that.  Oh, and wait till you  hear!  Nick Bottom the Weaver has a wife.  Where she came from, I guess  we'll never know.  She even has a speaking part.
There's also the  mystery of the bicycles.  They're definitely not from Athens or from Greek  mythology.  And the fairies' haunts in the woods look amazingly  pre-Raphaelite.
All that aside, there are some nice performances in  this film.  Stanley Tucci does a wonderful Puck, Kevin Kline actually  manages to do a good job with Bottom once his wife is out of the picture,  and the other tradesmen are quite well done.  Flockhart does a passable  Helena, and Michelle Pfeiffer is ravishing as Titania.
One thing I  couldn't get past in this movie is that there are at least four, count 'em,  four different accents being employed.  Hermia is obviously a long lost  sister of Elisa Doolittle, while Lysander sounds a lot more like, oh, James  Mason... meanwhile, Hippolyta seems to have gone to the Gina Lolabrigida  school of diction and Calista Flockhart... well who knows WHERE she got HER  accent.
Oh, while we're at it, is it REALLY necessary to have mud  wrestling in bloomers?  I mean, we all would have paid just to catch a  glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline.
Yes, this video is worth  seeing.  No, it isn't great Shakespeare.  Watch it just for fun.  Let's  hope Branaugh is over his Hamlet fiasco and back producing SERIOUS  performances of the Bard's work.",959126400,,1845,4.7365079365079366
1061740,5,6305622892,"The village of Monte Athena, Italy, at the turn of the Nineteenth Century is the setting for this delightful version of William Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" directed by Michael Hoffman.  Bustles are in  decline, and a new invention, the bicycle, is rising in popularity; and on  this one particular night in the forest, mortals and fairies come together  for a mirthful interlude rife with mischief, unsolicited intercession and  the pursuit of love.  This is a most engaging production, highlighted by a  number of outstanding performances, beautiful photography and a wonderful  score by Simon Boswell which features the talents of Cecilia Bartoli,  Luciano Pavarotti, Renee Fleming and Roberto Alagna.  Kevin kline gives  an especially noteworthy performance as bottom, while Rupert Everett  (Oberon), Dominic West (Lysander), Anna Friel (Hermia) and Sam Rockwell  (Flute) are also exemplary.  Michelle Pfeiffer is absolutely stunning as  Titania, Queen of the Fairies, and Stanley Tucci delivers a nimble Puck.  There are some wonderful moments in this movie, and one especially  memorable scene in which Bottom and his troop perform ""Pyramus and Thisbe""  for the Duke (David Strathairn) and Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau); it is  hysterical.  Rounding out this superb cast are Calista Flockhart  (Helena), Christian Bale (Demetrius), Roger Rees (Quince), Max Wright  (Starveling), Gregory Jbara (Snug), Bill Irwin (Snout), Bernard Hill  (Egeus) and John Sessions (Philostrate).

And if you've never had an English class where you liked Shakespeare or if you've never read and enjoyed an Elizabethan comedy  and/or tragedy, forget about this movie.  The language will just confuse  you too much.
But if you can get past your conservative views and are  open to the language, then watch A Midsummer Night's Dream.
I think  that after five hundred years, it's amazing that these plays are still  around and can generate such mainstream attention.  I also feel that after  that long, a fresh adaptation is more than welcome, especially if you've  been subjected to the less than glamorous BBC version.
I felt that the  setting (the Italian Athens you've never heard of) and anachronistic props  (bikes with lights) actually lend to the farcical quality of this movie.  It is a comedy and it is supposed to be funny, so lighten up and enjoy the  fantastic  performances of Michelle Pfeiffer (my FAVORITE Fairy Queen),  Rupert Everett (fairy king--pun intended?), Kevin Kline as Bottom (he makes  an Ass  of himself--heehaw), and the myriad of other wonderful actors and  actresses that breathe life into an old play.

Until we saw everyone together in the end, the two couples shown  earlier in the story had nothing to do with the couple shown later. If this  had been written as two separate stories it might not have been as  confusing. The historical language made the movie even harder to follow.  You had to REALLY listen closely (maybe more than once) to the poetry in  order to understand the point trying to be made at any given time. The  language should have been updated, with some of the historical poetry added  when necessary (when necessary would not be an everyday, ordinary  conversation). Michelle Pfeiffer was definitely not one of the main  characters but they used her to attract an audience which probably would  have otherwise been non-existent.

The most outlandish use of poetic license was when Puck  (actor/director Stanley Tucci) was taking his ride on the bicycle. It  seemed very out of place for this mythical creature to be doing this.

I teach a Shakespeare course, I've studied Shakespeare at Oxford,  I've seen 30 or so productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and I've  got news for you. This video is just fine! True Shakespeare buffs are  theater people, not dusty curmudgeons so old they fart dust. I have seen  about 15 versions of AMND, and this certainly holds its own. The setting is  a fantasy world anyway, so putting it in Tuscany does not violate any  ""rule."" There are some niggling complaints: Kline's Bottom is a  little too sad, and Callista Flockhart is supposed to be playing the ugly  one. She is not convincing. There are many gems as well, Rupert Everett's  lithe,sensuous Oberon foremost among them.  A bit of trivia: one of  Christian Bale's earliest roles was as the boy in Branagh's Henry V, and he  continues to delight. You may watch this video, enjoy it, AND consider  yourself a Shakespearean.

1061823,5,6305622892,"I echo most of the kind words previously offered to this version, but want to add a few additional observations.  First, rather like ""Shakespeare In Love,"" it amply rewards a second viewing, and a third.  Also as in  the case of ""S.I.L.,"" it was a film that the makers obviously had  fun making.  Cheers, of course, to Kevin Kline (given an opportunity to  combine some serious acting with his patented eye-rolling mania), Calista  Flockhart (a sublime comedienne), Stanley Tucci, and many of the minor  roles, such as Roger Rees as Quince.  The gorgeous Sophie Marceau doesn't  have much to do, but just looking at her is ample reward.  The production  values are exalted, and the insertion of opera vocals by such as Renee  Fleming and Cecilia Bartoli delightful...if distracting, I can't resist  singing along with them.  They even made up one extra as a dead ringer for  Giuseppi Verdi, stovepipe hat and all. Pure Shakespeare?  Of course not.

The scenery and music were to DIE for, and the  actors executed their parts perfectly. I do have a few little nitpicks,  though: Bicycles? Maby. With Lights? NO. I doubt that in Shakespeare's time  they had lights. And Why on earth is it not set in Athens? It looks more  like England! And the Hippolyta in this version is completely un-Amazonian.  Also, if you're real familiar with the words of the play, you'll notice  that they left some parts and words out of this version. But, like I said,  It's a great movie, and it does say ""based"" on the Play by W.S.,  so they didn't >have< to follow it exactly.
And I will say that  Kevin Kline was wonderful in this, as well as Calista Flockhart (albiet  pulling off the 'Desperate Helena' part perfect!)",947721600,,923,4.573170731707317

This hilarious tale of love gone awry  thanks to the mischief of the fairy world is told through splendid visual  and musical scenery.  Shot in Italy, it really adds a touch of wonder to  the already wonderous atmosphere. My favorite is Kevin Kline as Bottom, the  actor without a clue, although I do love Christian Bale as the spiteful  Demetrius, who has a great change of heart by the end of the film.

1061828,4,6305622892,"Well, I have little to add that my fellow critics have not already mentioned.  The movie truly did convey a sense of magic and wonder.  Sometimes I think this play is so well loved because it takes the mind back  to its earlier child-like fantasies.  And this movie succeeds superbly in  creating for today's visually oriented viewers the fantastic world that the  Bard's audiences would have visualized clearly with their ears alone.
I'm sorry to hear that many still consider Shakespeare's poetry more an  obstacle than a pleasure, for the words truly are the music of the play.  But it IS unfamiliar to many, and if movies such as this are able to bridge  the gap between today's audiences and Shakespeare's verse, to spark the  interest of the average viewer and prompt him or her to discover the magic  of the poetry one-on-one, then it's a good thing.
Speaking of music, I  was delighted as much by what I heard in this film as what I saw.  Using  Mendelssohn's incidental music to this very play was a welcomed treat and I  found the operatic selections equally effective.
I enjoyed this movie  tremedously from first to last, and thought it handled both the comic and  the sublime with a masterful touch.  I recommend it to those who venerate  the Bard as well as to those who are now just getting to know him.  For  those who prefer the comic vein to the tragic, it is as good an  introduction to Shakespeare as any I know of.",946944000,,1435,4.545098039215686

While the first half moves a bit more swiftly than the second, and there is more emphasis than Shakespeare made of Kevin  Kline's Bottom, the overall effort is more than satisfying.  The language  is delivered coherently, the fairies are delightful, and the wandering  lovers, lost in the woods are extremely believable in this outing.  I was  especially delighted with the decision to set the action in Tuscany in the  19th century and to use the bicycle as a comic device.

I  thought at the time that such an original idea could only have come out of  Hollywood. But no it just happened to originate in a dingy little flea  infested attic room above an amateur London theatre some 400 years  ago. Shakespeare,what a guy. His works will live on and on long after we're  gone.
As for the movie well for her role as Hermia I can finally forgive  Calista Flockhart for all those shenanigans she pulls off in Ally  McBeal. Well done girl! I agree with all the praise heaped on Kevin Klines  performance but I thought Stanley Tucci also deserved some kudos for his  portrayal of Puck. Because it was such a pivotal role I thought he made the  movie,even with his broad New York accent. Well he made me laugh a few  times. Pfeiffer's sexy Queen Titania was excellent while Rupert Everitt  seemed to fit Oberon like a new skin. He never looked so macho!

I could just imagine William Shakespeare watching and enjoying every minute of this  beautiful production. I'm sure that this is exactly how he would have  intended it to performed if he were here today. Kevin Kline does things I  didn't know an actor could do... maybe his best performance to-date!  Calista Flockhart avoids doing anything that could even remind you of Ally  McBeal despite the closeness of the characters. She is shockingly good and  pleasant as is everybody else.

The film's  scenery, from the mysterious and evocative depths of the enchanted wood to  Theseus' richly appointed palace, was magnificent. And the actors  themselves were both delightful and compelling. Michelle Pfeiffer was  enchantingly beautiful as Titania, the Queen of the Fairies, and Rupert  Everett was in his element as her darkly handsome and commanding consort,  Oberon.

I teach English to teenagers.  Teenagers, who gasp in horror at the mention of Shakespeare.  Teenagers, with their 30 second attention spans, faulty grasp of the modern English they supposedly speak, and affection for the physical comedy of the likes of ""Jackass.""
So, how do we make teenagers like Shakespeare?  We edit.  So, naturally, some of the best speeches are missing or drastically shortened (remember, 30 second attention spans); the physical, often silly humor is accented; and the women mud wrestle.  So what?
This movie is entertaining.  At times, it is enchanting.  It is fast-paced, visually interesting, and funny.  The emphasis is shifted away from the complexities of the language because it is the language, the very thing we love about Shakespeare, that makes these plays inaccessible to the majority of the American movie audience.
I use this film because it is easy to understand.  The actors have faces my students recognize, and it gets them excited about Shakespeare.
What this film does is to put the content of the play within the grasp of its modern audience.  Shakespeare himself would have done no less.",1089936000,,1363,5.040178571428571
7893215,3,6305622892,"One of Shakespeare's most beloved works finally gets a modern cinematic makeover, good news for all of those who'd rather not see Mickey Rooney's Puck again.  Unfortunately the latest retelling leaves much to be desired. Though mostly enjoyable, this film could use a good shot of fairy dust.
The story concerns three sets of lovers - Hermia and Lysander, Helena and Demetrius, and fairy royalty Titania and Oberon. The first pair loves each other but cannot marry because Hermia is betrothed to Demetrius, the object of Helena's desperate affection.  When Hermia and Lysander steal away, the second couple makes chase and all four end up lost in the woods where our third pair, the quarreling fairy king and queen, reside.  Oberon, dissatisfied with all about him, enlists his servant, Puck, to make amends. Puck is to place a spell on Demetrius so that he will fall in love with Helena, but a case of mistaken identity causes Lysander to become smitten with her. Meanwhile, a traveling actors troupe, led by Nick Bottom, stumbles into the woods for a late-night rehearsal. They prepare a play for the Duke's wedding and soon become the object of the fairies' mischief.
With the shell of Shakespeare's original, this movie pulls of adequate amounts of wit and humor; clearly the script is better than most.  Despite Puck's much abbreviated role, it remains a light comedy and surreal and magical in every sense. The costuming, makeup, and Italian backdrop add to the enchantment and are some of the most enjoyable aspects of an aesthetically pleasing film. I loved the energy of Monte Athena in turn-of-the-century Italy (punctuated by a soundtrack of renowned operatic talent), although it added little to the understanding of the story or the updated time period.
My main qualm for this otherwise fanciful retelling is the distracted acting, which ranges from inspiring to embarrassing. Shakespeare's language, archaic by our standards, depends on talented actors and directors to lift it and his beautiful stories from obscurity. Kevin Kline proves that you don't need an English accent to perform Shakespeare effectively. His Nick Bottom is the most rounded character in the film, wholly human and rich with emotions thick enough to dip your fingers through. Anna Friel's Hermia acutely defines the play's romance and innocence. Along with Kline, she seems the most comfortable in her role and possesses a grace and naturalness absent from the other female characters. Dominic West gives an amusing and (sometimes) smitten Lysander to Friel's Hermia. I also liked Roger Rees' affectionate Peter Quince. The remainder of the cast spirals downward. Calista Flockhart as Hermia and Michelle Pfieffer as Titania appear uncomfortable and rather unsure of their characters, as if they are too afraid of fouling up the Bard's work to dig deeply into it. Rupert Everett's Oberon is tired and melancholy to a point of boredom. I am still trying to figure out why David Strathrain, who lacks the nobleness of his character, was cast as the Duke. Poor Sophie Marceau should have stuck with Mel Gibson. Though I would not have picked Stanley Tucci for Puck, he provides a slightly amusing if ineffectual performance, as does Christian Bale as Demetrius.
Because of the spotty acting, the film never gels completely. An unfamiliarity with the play by certain actors interrupts otherwise fluid scenes. Those who act well in this film make it worth watching; the others leave us wanting more.",1080604800,,3482,5.103508771929825
7893216,3,6305622892,"Surprisingly unentertaining. Perhaps it was because I was not in a jolly mood when I watched this. This film version of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' simply does not capture the verve of a play. Obviously, this is in film format, but not much - other than dazzling scenery, costumes, music, and change of setting - have been added. One would think these additions were a dramatic improvement. Instead, they seem to conceal a fairly sloppy Shakespeare production. Subtelty could have been used to a greater extent. This movie is somewhere between a decent theatre production and a good film.
Regarding acting (which I consider the most vital part of a Shakespeare presentation), it was only adequate. Kevin Kline was a surprisingly good Shakespearian actor. His Bottom was less obnoxious than I had previously seen. Stanley Tucci, as Puck, was one of the better actors in the play. I only wish he were in it more. Dominic West was a solid Lysander; Anna Friel, Hermia, faired as well as West. Rupert Everett was a fine Oberon, though the softness of his voice got old (my only criticism), and John Sessions shined in his tiny role as Philostrate.
Michelle Pfeiffer was okay as Titania. She was gorgeous, and is obviously a capable actress, but her drawn out voice became a bit too sing song for my taste. Calista Flockhart was a passable Helena. Christian Bale (Demetrius), was disappointing - expressionless, and his lines were not believable. The mechanicals were touching and well acted. Theseus (David Strathairn) was particularly bad, and the little time Sophie Marceau did have as Hippolyta was not memorable. Bernard Hill was a decent Egeus.
Somehow I always imagined Bottom as a bachelor. However, this change added to the different portrayal of Bottom as a sympathetic character. Also, the play at the end lost just a whit of its humorous impact by having the audience laugh. If they had not laughed, though, viewers of the movie simply would have felt sorry for Bottom and his gang.
Perhaps three stars is a harsh rating for a Shakespeare production. After all, this had a great script (though beloved parts were expectedly eliminated), and the acting was not terrible. I just felt that the actors did not have the charisma or the lovers the chemistry to carry off an already unbelievable story when this time there is a screen between the audience and them.",1076803200,,2365,4.885572139303482

While the director may have taken slight liberties in this production, the essential elements - the Chinese box structure, the reality-layering, and the contrasting of Goddess Time with Linear Time, which lie at the very core of the play, are very much intact.
A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest are without a doubt The Bard at his most inspired and most magical. This is a gorgeous production and yet another showcase for the seemingly limitless genius of Kevin Kline.",1067904000,,706,5.042735042735043
