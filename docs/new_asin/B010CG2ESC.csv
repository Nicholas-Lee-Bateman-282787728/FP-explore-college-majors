8721831,5,B010CG2ESC,"Making a film is a labor of love and you never forget your first one. While any first film with a low budget is not without technical flaws, this film does many things right. The story is solid and for the most part the actors give good performances. Go grab a copy and check it out. Enjoy it for what it is and hopefully we will be discussing the sequel soon.",1442620800,2,360,4.084507042253521
