8505059,5,B006VPOAUE,"This documentary of the haunting Chester Gillette/Grace Brown Adirondack murder case of 1906 should be seen by anyone already familiar with the fascinating story, or those who should be. It was the basis of Theodore Dreiser's classic novel An American Tragedy as well as the 1951 film A Place in the Sun starring Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The documentary features real photos as well as reenacted scenes of the fatal relationship between Chester and Grace that eventually led to murder in the cold waters of Big Moose Lake. In addition, there is detailed information about the sensational (in its time) trial and Chester's ultimate execution. One viewing and you will be inspired to read one of the several available books on the case.",1356566400,2,748,5.040322580645161
8505060,5,B006VPOAUE,"Well done documentary on the Grace Brown murder makes for an excellent primer to Craig Brandon's in depth book Murder in the Adirondacks.  Fittingly, Brandon and Jack Sherman tell the story of Grace's murder and Chester's trial accompanied by pictures and a few tasteful re-enactments.  I had hoped for more of a re-enactment(drama) based doc, but I can't criticize what Derek Taylor produced as it's perfect for anyone who is interested in the people involved beyond what the ghost stories provide.",1327449600,2,499,5.148148148148148
