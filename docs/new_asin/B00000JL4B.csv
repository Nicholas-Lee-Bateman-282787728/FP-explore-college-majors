This contains episodes 22-24, 22 being the season finale of Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro finally fights Shin, and you have a picture of a no-name punk flapping his tongue around at Ken on the cover.. But anyway, episode 22 is one of the most dramatic episodes of any TV series I've ever seen. But make sure you buy this subtitled. The dubbed version totally destroys the drama, and they even completely remove the vocalized song ""Yuria.. Towa Ni"" that plays during one of the most powerful moments of the series, replacing it with some synthesizer garbage. Buy the subtitled version!",993340800,,632,4.754545454545455
7912486,5,B00000JL4B,"This video contains the closing episode to the first season of Fist of the North Star, and the next two episodes. Finally, Ken reaches the end of his mad ambition to kill Shin and the best battle in all 8 tapes takes place. Everything from the music to the acting to the action was excellent. What happens to Julia is not what one would expect.... In season two, a man named Rei appears, who practices Nanto Suichoken, an attack which makes perfect incisions in enemies with his hands, causing them to split apart. His technique is said to parallel Hokuto Shinken. And Rei's goal is to defeat Kenshiro... So, buy this. Now. Please.",973296000,2,631,4.592920353982301
