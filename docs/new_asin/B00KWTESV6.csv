6452598,5,B00KWTESV6,"I love all the Perry Mason movies.  I can't wait to get the last ones, (ie: Case of the Deadly Kiss)  is one of them.  I have purchased all of the new Perry Mason volumes.  Now I am waiting for the last ones.

6452599,5,B00KWTESV6,"I bought this DVD as a gift. I think it's great they are FINALLY coming out with the Perry Mason movies on DVD. My only complaint is that there are only 2 movies per DVD, so it's going to be a little pricey to be able to pick them all up. (Only 1 DVD per package)  I waited until this one went on sale. (Since I bought it as a gift, I can't tell you if it has subtitles or not, or if there are any extras.) But you can't go wrong with Raymond Burr as Perry Mason.",1420416000,4,463,3.7244897959183674
