6788669,5,B00P6ZG88C,"Fascinating documentary. I want to believe in that consciousness exists outside the body, and yet I'm skeptical at the same time, as there seems to be little clear evidence of it out there, and I've never had any experiences of that nature. This documentary, in very simple, yet compelling accounts, helped me see the very real possibility of this occurring for many people - not in the context of near death experiences, but in laboratory-like studies that have apparently allowed people to experience this when the body is in a sleep-like state. It's really piqued my curiosity and helped me open my eyes to a whole subject and realm that I'd never really heard of or knew existed, .",1444867200,17,685,4.764705882352941
6788670,5,B00P6ZG88C,Very interesting documentary.  A balanced perspective of an nontraditional view of reality that is growing into a respected field of sceince.,1476921600,,141,5.714285714285714
6788671,5,B00P6ZG88C,"Fantastic film about the realms which exist beyond this five-sense prison we too often limit ourselves to.  The topic is fascinating and frightening the deeper the film delves.  But well worth your time.  OBE's are real.  The question is, what's happening?  What are the limits of the power of the will and consciousness?  Who lives on the other side?  What are demons?  What are guides?  And who are the brave adventurers/scientists/experiencers trying to gain us answers?

The Path attempts to shed light on this topic from a scientific as well as spiritual perspective.  We have more responsibility than we know.  We have more power to create our experiences than we know.  We are part of a much larger reality than we may WANT to know.  But facts is facts, as they say.  And the tales told (as well as the rationalizations given) in this film will make you see the spectrum of OBE's differently.",1476835200,,899,4.746753246753247
6788672,2,B00P6ZG88C,"I am a big fan of the subject of OBE's and have listened to Bill Buhlman, read his books, and watch various YouTube videos but ""The Path"" is nothing but a one and a half hour infomercial for the Monroe Institute  and a regurgitation of the info that is found in Mr. Buhlman's online videos, so for me this was just a waste of time. I don't recommend this video to anyone but what I do recommend is going on YouTube searching for William Buhlman - there is more informative info to be had rather than sitting through this one and a half hour commercial.",1474329600,12,552,4.257142857142857
6788673,4,B00P6ZG88C,Love this topic and it was interesting.,1473552000,,39,4.714285714285714
6788674,4,B00P6ZG88C,"The content is rather interesting; not sure what to make of it personally. If accurate, this is quite profound information. It is fascinating to think about. It is an older documentary, quite simply made, but the topic is interesting. If you get a little bored 3/4 thru, hang on, because the tail end I found to be enthralling.",1472947200,,327,4.655172413793103
6788675,4,B00P6ZG88C,enlightens and ideology of energy that seems to make it more understandable on the Science end of it all. At least it gives you some room outside of a religious box and explains fears. Nice to think about for a while.,1468540800,,217,4.317073170731708

6788677,5,B00P6ZG88C,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Like many, I'm skeptical, and it is precisely that which separates me from the ability to experience advanced adventures in consciousness. To clear away the junk our minds have been packed with means to open ourselves to the miraculous, wide-open nature of existence. Out-of-body experiences, remote viewing, and connecting with alternate realities are possible for anyone willing to believe and put in the effort to make it happen.",1465516800,5,465,5.383561643835616

8686623,5,B00P6ZG88C,"I call it the Inner Space Program, because we have to travel inward to reach our real universe.  Like so many others, I had a paranormal experience, which changed my mind about our existence.  Trying to explain that experience became an obsession, because I was trying to find a loved one who left the physical.  I used a lot of trial and error, and searched for authors that fit my experiences.  Later, I realized that they all had one thing in common: Training at TMI (The Monroe Institute).  I tried to find out why, and watched all the videos I could find, but still could not see the complete story that the Path 11 series conveys.  There are four videos in the following order:  Afterlife, Beyond the Physical, Evolution, and Evolution Bonus Footage.  These 4 videos explain the incredible journey of Bob Monroe, the pioneer of modern consciousness experiments and his team of explorers and experts.  To everyone who created this masterpiece, I along with many others will be eternally grateful. This is a beautiful and moving overview of a vast amount of experience, told by the authors themselves.  It is an amazing production, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  To everyone who created this production, thank you so very much.",1482105600,,1229,4.832535885167464
