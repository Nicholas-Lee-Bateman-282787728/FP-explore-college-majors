5963902,5,B00F2VDNWY,"Just got my Power Yoga 2 DVD last night and did some of the workouts.  I'm a devoted yogi and typically only follow traditional yoga/ashtanga.  But I love Zuzka's spin on it.  It's a great mix of yoga, strength training, and what ends up being cardio.  With several different programs on the DVD, you can mix it up and make your own workout, or use these individually for the 'active rest day' and stretching.  It's a great option to add to my workout arsenal.  Thanks Z!!! :)",1379030400,12,476,4.413793103448276
5963903,5,B00F2VDNWY,"The best workout! While being based in yoga, the workout incorporates strength and cardio training.  This isn't your typical power yoga workout.  It does have certain  yoga moves and balances, but is not solely a yoga DVD.

This workout provides full body strength training and gets your heart rate up with HIIT elements.  I read reviews of the 1st yoga DVD in the series and saw people hoping that they could do the complete DVD without having to start each section seperately.  The second in the series lets you go through the whole workout without having to touch the remote. I hope she does more in this series. They are fabulous!",1402185600,,634,4.666666666666667
5963904,5,B00F2VDNWY,Just awesome!,1398556800,,13,6.0
5963905,5,B00F2VDNWY,"What else can I say? She nailed it again! This DVD is more challenging than the first, so be prepared. Had a great time with this one, another for the collection",1396224000,,161,4.225806451612903
5963906,5,B00F2VDNWY,I did everything on the dvd except the Upper Body Burpee segment due to a sore shoulder. This dvd was a lot of fun to do. It was very challenging but was so worth it. I think I like this one better than her first one.,1395100800,,217,3.739130434782609
5963907,5,B00F2VDNWY,"Fantastic workout at a great price I have tried and still use p90x, turbo fire, insanity, etc. And these are cheaper and just as good if not better than the others.",1394928000,,164,4.32258064516129
5963908,5,B00F2VDNWY,"My advice is watch it once so that you know what to expect that way when you follow along you kind of already have an idea of what to do. I'm a big fan of Zuka and you will be surprised at how much of a workout this really is,",1393372800,,226,3.54
5963909,5,B00F2VDNWY,I love all her DVDs! I have long work hours & this is the only HIT workout that gets results fast.,1393027200,,98,3.7142857142857144
5963910,5,B00F2VDNWY,I LOVE ZUZKA and all of her workouts! She is a great instructor for everything that she does! Definitely recommend any and all of her workout DVDs.,1389571200,,147,4.481481481481482
5963911,4,B00F2VDNWY,"I have volume 1 & 2 of the ZCUT Power Yoga Series. I love them BUT be warned. These are not, I repeat, NOT for beginners. I am out of shape and have a bad back but do not do all the routines. I would hurt myself. However, I take it slow and work my way up. If you looking for a challenge I highly recommend it. But if you're just starting, go some where else. Zuzana is very impressive, even her toes are ripped.",1388188800,,412,3.8588235294117648
5963912,5,B00F2VDNWY,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778
5963913,5,B00F2VDNWY,"This is truly a yoga-inspired workout as the description claims, so if you're looking for a traditional flow or you're just starting out in yoga, this DVD probably isn't for you. However, if you are interested in both yoga and getting more cardio out of your workout than what traditional vinyasa flows offer, then this is a great workout. Zuzka gets more cardio into a yoga flow by adding jumping lunges, squats a burpees.

Improvements have been made between the Vol. 1 DVD and Vol. 2. One of my only complaints with Vol. 1 is that you have to go back out to the menu between flows. This DVD has to option to play all flows straight through. Also like Vol. 1, some of the moves will be challenging at first, and maybe even impossible to do (i.e. going from crane pose into a plank). For me, that's a benefit to this DVD because I can challenge myself and still get a good workout, and these moves will become doable with practice.

All in all, this is a fun workout for a great price and I recommend it for anyone who wants to switch up their routine.",1383350400,,1053,4.340101522842639
5963914,5,B00F2VDNWY,"You cannot stop the avalanche that has descended on the fitness world in the form of Zuzka! She has created ANOTHER exceptional yoga DVD and I really enjoy the difficulty level on this one. It's a bump up from her first yoga dvd and really challenges you. Would recommend for those that have completed her first yoga series or have a basic knowledge and understanding of yoga, but it's also fairly easy to pick up and attempt.",1383091200,,426,4.545454545454546
5963915,5,B00F2VDNWY,I just started getting into doing yoga. I have done Zuzka's workouts for 4 years now.  This is yoga + a workout. Not just stretching.  I also like that you can choose to do just a short segment or go through the whole DVD if you have time.,1383004800,,239,3.9583333333333335
5963916,5,B00F2VDNWY,I absolutely love all of Zuzka's workout videos. Her workouts keep on getting better and better. I have seen a definite difference and a change in my figure doing her workouts.,1382659200,,176,4.709677419354839
5963917,5,B00F2VDNWY,"I was waiting on the beginners to do the yoga poses right. now i can work vol 1.
love it :-)
thanks for following your passion.",1382313600,,127,3.923076923076923
5963918,5,B00F2VDNWY,"I am not into yoga much at all, but I am into good, challenging workouts and this one is amazing. Zuzka brings her charming blend of encouragement and focus to this unique power yoga workout. I am glad that Volume 2 has the option to play all the workouts back-to-back. The music is awesome and flows well with the movements. It is a surprisingly difficult upper body workout and I was pleasantly sore the next day. Even if you are very fit, you will find this a challenge and will work up a good sweat.",1382140800,2,503,4.3052631578947365
5963919,5,B00F2VDNWY,I have every one of Zuzka's workout DVD's and I've never been disappointed. Each one is better than the last and they are all so different. This puts a fun twist on traditional yoga and is definitely more of a workout than you would expect yoga to be. You can do mini workouts or go through the entire DVD. Definitely recommend this!,1382140800,2,333,4.387096774193548
5963920,5,B00F2VDNWY,"I usually don't write reviews but just had to after completing this workout! Zuzka is amazing I absolutely loved this yoga DVD I also have her first one which would get 5 stars as well. She has such a new fresh approach to yoga and ALL her workouts she never ceases to amaze me! It's not like any other yoga I've done before. I usually do Bryan Kest power yoga which I love but Zuzka has a different approach I was dripping sweat when done I completed the whole DVD at once and it""s not for beginners I consider myself advanced maybe even a little less there were moves/poses on here I barely could do. Looking forward to adding this into my workout collection!!",1380844800,,662,4.346774193548387
5963921,5,B00F2VDNWY,"I purchased Power Yoga, Volume 1 and loved it.  I purchased Volume 2 as soon as it was released.

The first thing I noticed was the way the DVD is set up; there's an option to play the disc all the way through (as opposed to Volume 1, when you have to manually select each workout).

Similar to Volume 1, the warm up itself is a bit of a workout.  Segments include:
*Warmup
*Sumo Workout
*Balance Flow Workout
*Upper Body Burpee Workout
*Twisted Chair Workout
*Warrior Endurance Series
*100 Abs Workout
*Cooldown

I was surprised at how hard this DVD is.  There isn't one workout I can get through at my current fitness level, and I consider myself pretty fit (yoga, running, CrossFit 5 times a week).  I considered giving this less than 5 stars based on the level of difficulty, but then I changed my mind.  We buy workout DVDs to take us to the next level; and this one certainly will.  I am modifying the workouts so I can still be challenged and get to the point I can do it right along Zuzka.

The moves are a little more difficult to understand (in my opinion) than Volume 1, so I found it helpful to watch the DVD once and learn what Zuzka was giving verbal cues to do.

I recommend buying this DVD, but purchasing and becoming familiar with Volume 1 first.",1380672000,29,1264,4.336170212765958
5963922,5,B00F2VDNWY,"I don't like regular yoga because it forces me to contort my body into painful awkward positions and hold the pose and I always feel like a giant stiff iron-board about to fall flat on my face no matter how hard I try.

I Have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this power yoga series. I love Zuzka's poses, she doesn't make you hold them rather she moves through them in a quick secession of different yoga movements and you don't even realize you're doing yoga until half way through it and by then it's over and you start to feel aches in areas of your body you never even knew existed.

I am the type of person who workouts but rarely stretches, so I was looking for something that would force to me stretch. And this DVD delivers! Not only did I get an awesome workout I feel like every single part of my body got stretched and I did become a lot more flexible since I started to include the power yoga in my workouts last month. I own both Vol 1 & Vol 2.",1379894400,18,962,4.111702127659575
8611798,5,B00F2VDNWY,"Zuzka is awesome!  This video is filled with fun cardio moves, that then flow into a yoga routine.  It gets your heart rate up and stretches out all your muscles.  I love the yoga/interval mix because it gets your heart rate up, and forces you to take deep breaths during the yoga segments, which makes the yoga even more refreshing.  I have tried other yoga/cardio interval workouts before but found them too slow and disjointed.  This video flows between the different types of exercises well and goes at a good pace.  I highly recommend this workout.",1447286400,,553,4.708333333333333
8611799,5,B00F2VDNWY,I found this to be of good quality and very nice that the video is follow along format. Z has great energy and she shows it from the start. Someone who really cares about fitness for all.,1446163200,,187,4.081081081081081
8611800,3,B00F2VDNWY,"I adore her,  this is a  fantastic work out series that will kick your butt,  short enough to fit in daily.",1430697600,,107,4.0
8611801,3,B00F2VDNWY,I've done it once. A bit repetitive but effective. I like her other dvds a lot.,1419811200,,79,4.0
8611802,5,B00F2VDNWY,"I've been doing many forms of yoga for over 15 years.  Within the last few years, my training has shifted quite a bit to include forms of unconvention training such as kettlebells, power lifting and crossfit.  I have not furthered my yoga practice much since this time, however do go back to it every now and again.  After trying out some other Zuzka workouts, I decided to give this one a shot for my off days that I don't go to the gym, and to get back into my stretching and mobility a little.  This workout is fantastic, especially if you do each segment in one session rather than one here and one there.  You'll get a great workout using body weight alone, and there are enough *traditional* yoga poses incorporated so that you still feel you are getting your stretching and mobility work in.  I will say I don't believe this would be good for beginners to yoga, as some of the poses can be difficult to learn with out practice and detailed explanation.  There are also many plank to chaturanga moves incorporated within pretty much every segment, so be prepared for a decent amount of upper body/arm/shoulder work!  Great job Zuzka - I see this dvd as being my new go to workout for the weekends and at home.",1418515200,,1215,4.46606334841629
8611803,5,B00F2VDNWY,anything Zuzka is great!,1413244800,,24,5.25
8611804,5,B00F2VDNWY,"Rating this workout on the challenge alone, I give it five stars; but there are some things I didn't particularly like.
I have been looking for a program like this for years.  I am 33 yrs old, and I have been into fitness for the past 15+ years.  I have tried most everything out there and I am always looking for something fun and different to challenge myself (Insanity, Insanity Asylum, P90X, marathons, ocean sports).  I LOVE power yoga, but sometimes I don't think it is challenging enough - unless it's super advanced (with inversions and crazy pretzel like twisting that I am unable to do).
Zuzka takes yoga and makes it into a more dynamic cardio/strength yoga-themed workout.  She takes some of the most challenging moves in yoga (chatarunga, crescent pose, warrior 3, chair series) and throws in some plyo moves to create a tough 6-12 minute mini ""flows"".  They are pretty intense! Just what I have been looking for!
So why not five stars?  This is quite different from traditional yoga. The video stops at each section (chapter) and there is about a 1 minute break between each section when she introduces the new section.  I really wish she would ""flow"" from one section to the other.  Also, Zuzka doesn't quite have the typical Yogi inflection.  Yoga teaching is an art and although Zuzka knows how to challenge the body, I didn't quite get into the Yoga breathing or mindset with Zuzka.  There is little explanation regarding breath and form (I am okay with that, but it might be a problem for those who aren't very experienced with Yoga).
With that said, I highly recommend this for anyone that is seeking a tough, challenging workout!",1410739200,,1650,4.7177700348432055
8611805,5,B00F2VDNWY,Great workout,1408579200,,13,6.0
8611806,5,B00F2VDNWY,Power yoga 2 is NO joke. I love the challenge.,1406073600,,46,3.7
8611807,5,B00F2VDNWY,"This is the first yoga workout I've done that was actually difficult! It's a fantastic workout for moderate to very high fitness levels. I think a beginner could use it as well, but will take some work to finish at the instructor's intensity.",1403136000,,242,4.651162790697675
