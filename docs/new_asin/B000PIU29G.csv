8191868,5,B000PIU29G,"Very calming movie. Family friendly.  I rented it from the video store and watched it with my daughter. She passed out after the beginning. It has a good story line about a humble family man who lives in Hawaii. This movie shows so many beautiful scenes of nature and it almost makes you feel like you're there (or really want to be.) There's so many soothing sounds of the water, birds, and sounds like windchimes, the harp, and sound bowls. The sounds put my daughter to sleep. If you're having a bad day, angry about something, can't sleep, going through anxieties, watching this movie will slow your heart rate and make you imagine you're camping in paradise -far, far away from where you are right now.",1467417600,,707,4.611111111111111

8191871,1,B000PIU29G,"It was so bad I couldn't stop watching it. We must've watched a differnt movie. Boring, boring, boring. Bad voiceover. My husband and I use ""Stonecutter"" to reference the worst movie ever made.",1393545600,,193,4.878787878787879

8191873,5,B000PIU29G,"This film is all visual as  the story  is narrated by the screen play writer. You hear his voice with slight Dutch accent,music and Tahitian singing .

Some of my favorite visual images:

""Old Thomas"" and the Stonecutter paddling  an outrigger canoe on the clear ocean

The big, long  table and low benches used by the Stonecutter and his family. It really has to be the most beautiful dining table and ""chairs"" that I have ever seen.

Elephant bamboo railing along side the lanai/porch.

Toy outrigger canoe made from a coconut husk,sticks  and a leaf.

Pareo fabrics

Tropical Flora and Fauna of Tahiti

Roasting coffee beans over an open fire and hand grinding beans.

The Stonecutter's  woven coconut frond  back pack.

Mantra Rays being fed by the Stonecutter in pristine water.

----------------------------

The thread of the story is about a beautiful child with green eyes who gives the Stonecutter 7  sounds.

This film showed me that a simple life is the best.",1187827200,2,971,4.87037037037037
