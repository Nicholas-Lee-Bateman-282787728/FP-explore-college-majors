2073485,5,B0002ADWE4,"I love this movie and hate that I can't get it in a regular DVD format.  I happened to see it on a cable channel and was very happily surprised.  It has intrigue, action, suspense, humor, emotion and a smart exploration of what it might be like to be telepathic.",1217376000,3,262,4.22
2073486,5,B0002ADWE4,I LOVED this movie!  I caught it on tv and it intrigued me from the very beginning.  My only problem is finding it on DVD - I can only find it in Region 2 format and it doesn't work on my player.  Why is it so hard to find?!  *sigh*,1190505600,8,232,3.58
2073487,4,B0002ADWE4,Thoughtcrimes is slightly predictable but the acting is realistic and the idea is conceivable... hey with the NSA anything could be going on...,1136160000,3,143,5.260869565217392
8025196,5,B0002ADWE4,I love Joe Flanigan in this.  Too bad it never made it to tv.,1509580800,,61,3.357142857142857
8025197,1,B0002ADWE4,This was not the right version.,1480464000,,31,4.333333333333333
8025198,4,B0002ADWE4,"I LOVE this movie.  I caught it on USA network several years back and was dismayed to find it is a Region 2.  I have since watched it a few times on youTube (someone uploaded it in 10 munute increments.  If you can handle the ""squinty-vision"" quality I guess it's worthwhile.  I am now thinking about getting this DVD as someone said in another review it plays on their computer. Still the same as watching it on Youtube but at least it won't be in 9-10 minute increments.  If you have the means to see this in its entirety I highly recommend it.  Love the story line and wish they had made a go of the series...",1467936000,,612,4.188034188034188
8025199,5,B0002ADWE4,"Could have been a fantastic show.....great idea, awesome chemistry between main characters.....total mystery why this wasn t picked up.......",1426982400,,141,6.473684210526316
8025200,4,B0002ADWE4,"Since Region 2 is not valid for the USA and that's where it's been in Amazon.com, I have added it to my Netflix account but have been waiting a year for it to be available on DVD in Region 1.  I've heard great reports on this film and seeing Joe Flanigan perform.  Amazing that this film was released in 2003 and in 10 years it still has not been available in Region 1.  Oh well, just have to wait.",1375574400,,398,4.012658227848101
8025201,4,B0002ADWE4,"I heard about this movie from someone, that it was a pilot for a TV show that never got picked up.  I missed it on TV, I guess, and I couldn't find it ANYWHERE!  Apparently they never released it on DVD in Region 1 (NTSC/USA version) as I could only find Region 2.  I took a chance and bought it anyway.  Much to my pleased surprise, it played just fine on my computer!! Would NOT play in my Blu-Ray/DVD player, though.  But hey, I got to see it!  I loved Joe Flanigan as the insecure NSA agent; I enjoyed getting to 'eavesdrop' on what was going on in his head!  The girl who played the telepath is great, too, but I will probably never be able to remember her name!  I'm a little sad this didn't get turned into a series - maybe someday they'll make a movie sequel, or a series of movies (like Tom Selleck did with the Jesse Stone movies?)?  I'd love that!  In the meantime, I wish they'd release a Region 1 DVD or Blu-Ray of this one!",1368662400,6,937,4.0989010989010985
8025202,4,B0002ADWE4,I found this to be very interesting. It was different to what I was expecting but was pleasantly surprised. Navi Rawat was excellent.,1357257600,,133,4.826086956521739
8025203,4,B0002ADWE4,Item is as advertised. However the customer service rep didn't really answer my question prior to my purchase. That is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5. Glad I took a chance on this merchant anyway.,1272844800,,198,4.378378378378378
8025204,4,B0002ADWE4,Loved the movie. Would recommend it to anyone. Starts out slow but then gets very interesting.,1244505600,,94,4.9375
8025205,4,B0002ADWE4,"I really liked this movie! It's not a big-budget blockbuster, but it's definitely well thought-out, well-written, and well-made. It's like a little indie film that does everything right. It plays a bit like the pilot for a TV series in some ways, but I really enjoyed it on it's own, so that's no issue.

Basically they take the concept of telepathy and do a solid little film about what it would be like, and where you would go with it. Nothing groundbreaking or twisty or terrifically original in the plot, but it's so well-done - they don't try  for shock value or anything - so it turns into a solid, very enjoyable, well-thought-out, well-acted  movie. It was so very worth my time.",1228521600,3,687,4.614754098360656
