2783460,3,B000NVIGDE,"The CRIME CLASSICS 50 MOVIE PACK has one film in it that features 17 famous actors. Almost without exception though, this collection presents movies starring the no-name performers of the 'B' picture industry. These low-budget, quickly shot, edited and released three and four-reelers were once-upon-a-time the bread and butter of many a small and independent company. Even some of the bigger outfits, like RKO and UNIVERSAL, released their share of 'B's.

If you are unfamiliar with the likes of Frankie Darro, Kane Richmond, Jameson Thomas or Vivienne Osborn, the CRIME CLASSICS box set is a perfect opportunity for you to see how ""the other half"" kept themselves busy during Hollywood's Golden Era. And lest you think these forgotten titles aren't worthwhile-- look again. A good number of these are VERY well done!

Recommended for all fans of vintage motion pictures.

I would have liked to gotten more and better digital enhancement but for the price value is the goal here.  There were no real losers in this collection, no silents or obscure dubbed iron curtain remakes as a couple of collections have.  I liked them all and didn't have to strain too much to watch and hear the productions.  There were also some gems so I am secure that it is money well spent and I am glad to have these on my shelf.

These twelve two-sided DVD discs contain 50 crime or mystery films. They are comparable to the TV dramas of the 1950s-1960s. They were ground out to provide entertainment at the lowest cost. Some of the studios would be called ""Poverty Row"", a low-budget independent producer. While still entertaining, these are mostly overlooked by modern generations. They provide a view of culture in 1930s America. Their sight and sound quality are in line with the cost of this set, and vary from film to film. They were selected on price. Remember the movies on TV in the 1950s and 1960s? Thirty-one of these films were made in the 1930s, thirteen in the 1940s, and six in 1951 or later.

These low-budget, quickly shot, edited and released five or six-reelers were at one time the bread and butter of many a small and independent company. Even some of the bigger outfits, like RKO and UNIVERSAL, released their share of 'B' grade quickies.

8181518,4,B000NVIGDE,"A list of the films on this set is available on at least one of these reviews and others have commented on the audio/video quality. I'm just going to point out a few of the highlights in this set. Even a busy person who can only watch one movie a week is still set for a year with this set. The highlights include:

BLONDE ICE: Leslie Brooks does a great job as an icy femme fatale who will stop at NOTHING to get what she wants. The ending is a bit disappointing but Leslie's performance and the story in general make this one to watch.

BORDERLINE: features Fred MacMurray and Claire Trevor as undercover narcotics operatives working for different agencies but after the same villain, (Raymond Burr), but unaware of each other's law enforcement connection. It's a quick comedy/crime picture that isn't great but it's definitely entertaining.

DEATH FROM A DISTANCE: A great little gem of a film in which a murder takes place in a planetarium during a lecture in a room full of people. You've got some classic 30's B here. What with the brassy girl reporter, tough talking detectives and snappy dialogue full of 30's lingo. One of the better movies in this collection and the best murder mystery in a planetarium I've ever seen.

HOLD THAT WOMAN! Skip Tracer Jimmy Parker repossess a cheap radio that unbeknownst to him houses a small fortune in stolen diamonds. When the thieves find out what's happened, they come a `calling. There's more comedy than caper here in this amusing and breezy little gem.

HOLLYWOOD STADIUM MYSTERY: Neil Hamilton (Alfred on the 60's Batman!) plays a D.A. investigating the murder of a boxer moments before a championship fight.  He's forced to match wits and trade snappy wisecracks with a sharp female mystery writer. The only clue is a whistled tune. This is another good one.

THE LADY CONFESSES: Hugh Beaumont, the Beave's dad, plays a likable guy who is set to marry a sweet young thing, then has his wife (who disappeared seven years ago) show up. She is strangled and the plot is set in motion.  This is a very cheap yet entertaining quickie from PRC.

MURDER BY INVITATION: The relatives of a rich old woman unsuccessfully try to have her declared insane, so they can divide up her money. To show them that there are no hard feelings, she invites them to her estate for the weekend so she can decide to whom she actually will leave her money when she dies. Soon, however, family members begin disappearing.

THE RED HOUSE: This low-budget thriller concocts a Molotov cocktail of sexual frustration, psychological S&M, and pubescent curiosity that seems primed to explode at any minute. Stars Edward G. Robinson, Judith Anderson and Julie London.

SUDDENLY: A group of killers take over a house in a small town because the house is located in a perfect spot to allow them to assassinate the president of the US as he tours the town. You got some psychological melodrama, some suspense, some decent dialogue AND Frank Sinatra vs. Sterling Hayden

TOUGH TO HANDLE: Frankie Darro and Kane Richmond team up to bring down some racketeers who are running a fraudulent sweepstakes scam. It is light entertainment with some snappy lines and some over the top fake fighting and a very fast pace.",1291766400,2,3226,4.741071428571429
8181519,3,B000NVIGDE,"Enjoyed most of the movies and the quality is good. A few movies were lame, but most were good with actors like Edward G. Robinson and Frank Sinatra in gripping performances. Even better, if you can buy at a discount.",1280016000,,217,4.45
8181520,2,B000NVIGDE,"The sound track is nearly completely ruined by an an attempt to improve the sound on every Mill Creek collection that I have bought.

Music: To suppress hiss sounds in the high frequencies the music that accompanies the program has been so lowered in volume that you do NOT feel the musical emotion of the film. This makes every single show unnecessarily boring. It took me a while to realize what was going on. I found that on movies that I have duplicate copies by other DVD makers that the sound is much better and the overall effect is dramatically better even though they have more hiss. Hiss is soothing to some people and it is obviously not worth ruining the sound track to suppress it when you compare.

Dialog: It is hard to tell what the actors are saying. Apparently the sound hiss processing makes the sound suddenly go up and down in volume when an actor talks but the high part of the voice is suppressed to eliminate the hiss. This makes every actors voice sound dull and boring and women do NOT sound as feminine as they normally do (you miss the sexy voice of fem fatals). Suddenly you will hear a little more music when the voice is boosted louder reminding you that you are missing the musical sound track thus you are not feeling the emotion of the program.

Story: Some of these are great old B and B+ movies that are worth watching though they are not the highest budget programs so not the best. Sadly they are ruined by the sound processing. As I have said, I have found a copy of some of the movies on other DVD's and they are dramatically better. Sadly rated a 2.",1273536000,,1590,4.3830508474576275
