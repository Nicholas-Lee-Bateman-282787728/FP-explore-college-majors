8235499,3,B000ZIAXO0,"""Grasshoppers Can Be Controlled"" from the Science and Technology National Archives series, 22 minutes.

A U.S.D.A. film produced in 1955 for farmer education, this 22 minute color video reflects the atmosphere of 1950s farming. The opening scene is in a Midwestern or Plains church with a reading from the Book of Joel describing the grasshopper plagues. The term ""locust"" is applied in common language to both the cicada and the grasshopper but there is no confusion in this video that clearly resorts to ""grasshopper"" throughout the rest of the footage.  Close-up footage of female egg-laying is accompanied with illustrated frames. 1934 was considered a ""good growing year"" for grasshoppers with 25 to 75 percent crop destruction. The distinction is made between mild and dry good years that allow massive grasshopper survival, and the wet and cold years where fungus takes a high toll on eggs. There are dust bowl scenes although the causative link to the dust bowl is questionable; the grasshoppers' increase is due in part to the dry conditions and weakened crop defenses.  Various food crop destruction is shown: alfalfa, grains, etc. with an emphasis on the threat to the American economy. Grasshopper species shown include the red-legged, differential, clear-wing and ""migratory"" (not to be confused with the Rocky Mountain migratory locust that was extinct by this time (see the book ""Locust"" by Randy Lockwood).  However, the video switches among different species and they are not labeled. Useful video of oviposition, egg excavation. Egg survey teams are shown sifting for egg pods in late summer and fall. The old mimeo and typewriter technology, as well as the appearance of 1950s trucks, tractors, etc. will be a chuckle to young students. The brief discussion of contact and stomach powders and sprays includes now-banned chlordane, heptachlor, etc.  Personnel are using little to no personal protective equipment or gloves in spraying, which represents the understanding of that day. A brief message on the importance of insect scouting, public education, and farmer cooperation to keep down the population sizes ends the video.  The fact that we do not today see countryside skies filled with such grasshopper swarms attests to the effectiveness of modern farm practices first sketched in this primarily historical film.
