1235778,5,B00000JMQ5,"The quality of the sound is much better than in the VHS version I've seen (Dolby digital 2.0 on DVD). However there aren't any special features except scene selection.
The titles of the episodes listed are the following: ""Jeeves takes charge"", ""Tuppy and the terrier"", ""The purity of the turf"", ""The hunger strike"" and ""Brinkley Manor"".
The 5 episodes of this set appeared previously (VHS) under different titles: ""Jeeves' Arrival"", ""Golf Tournament"", ""The Gambling Event"", ""Hunger Strike"" and ""The Matchmaker"".
Two memorable characters are introduced: the ever-amiable, charming and foppish gentleman of the '30s, Bertie Wooster, and his stately, cultured and dignified valet, Jeeves. Bertie (and his helpless friends) finds himself in trouble all the time, and only the priceless Jeeves can extricate him and make things run smoothly again, until the next imbroglio comes up.
Their creator is P. G. Wodehouse (1881-1975). If you already met him, then no more talk is necessary. If he hasn't crossed your path yet, you're even luckier; you will be able to discover his sunny world starting afresh.
Bertie Wooster is played by Hugh Laurie and Jeeves by Stephen Fry. They are simply brilliant and I laughed myself into stitches watching the series.
Usually TV adaptations are disappointing, but in this case, none of the original flavor is lost!
Plot lines are not followed exactly sometimes and separate novels and short stories are combined together in one episode to make the whole thing livelier, but the final result is, somehow, exactly right.",986169600,60,1548,5.220883534136546
1235779,5,B00000JMQ5,"P.G. Wodehouse's creations never saw a finer performance than from the comedy team of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry.  These first five episodes of Jeeves and Wooster set the tone for the series, all 23 adventures.  Hysterical.
Bertie Wooster, an upperclass twit with a kind heart, is constantly subject to the whims of his evil aunts and egotistical friends.  Bertie is thus perpetually embroiled in trouble, but no fear!  His manservant Jeeves will surely save the day every time.  Stephen Fry plays Jeeves impeccably - as the valet who is quite frankly smarter than all of the so-called educated upperclass nobs who order him around.  But were it not for his sage wisdom, poor Bertie, perfectly realized by Hugh Laurie, would be long since married off to the likes of the awful Honoria Glossop!
A must buy!",985478400,11,806,4.846715328467154

I've seen all four seasons, and the one thing I found confusing is that sometimes secondary characters are played by different actors.

1235781,5,B00000JMQ5,"Readers who have seen my Amazon review of PGW's French Leave know I am an incurable fan of the Master. Here I will merely make some notes on the DVDs of the Jeeves and Wooster series, since other readers have already reviewed them so well. Since the TV episodes do not have titles, the shows appeared on video under various names, which made for mix-ups, and you could easily have bought the same show twice. This was particularly the case in the transition from the Masterpiece Theatre/PBS editions to the A&E sets. To make matters worse, A&E also retitled the sets variously, so you never knew what you were buying.
The DVDs are at least grouped by seasons. In the first season on VHS, the five shows,""Jeeves Arrival,"" ""Golf Tournament,"" The Gambling Event,"" ""Hunger Strike"" and ""The Matchmaker,"" also appeared as: ""Jeeves Takes Charge,"" ""The Purity of the Turf,"" ""Tuppy and the Terrier,"" ""The Hunger Strike,"" and ""Brinkley Manor."" The A&E boxed VHS set is called ""The Very First Jeeves and Wooster.""
The Second Season in VHS consisted of ""Jeeves Saves the Cow Creamer,"" ""A Plan for Gussie,"" ""Pearls Mean Tears,"" ""Kidnapped,"" and ""Jeeves the Matchmaker."" The Third Season on VHS was called ""More Jeeves and Wooster,"" and included ""Bertie Sets Sail,"" ""The Full House,"" Introduction on Broadway,"" ""Hot Off the Press,"" ""Comrade Bingo,"" and ""Right Ho Jeeves."" Fourth Season titles are: ""Return to New York,"" ""The Once and Future Ex,"" ""Bridegroom Wanted,"" The Delayed Arrival,"" ""Trouble at Totleigh Towers,"" and ""The Ties That Bind.""
I find the first three seasons eminently watchable, although they go slowly downhill from the excellent first season on. The fourth season departs too far from PGW's style to please longtime Wodehousians, but some viewers unfamiliar with Plum's books might like the faster pace better.
This retitling problem occurs with P.G.Wodehouse's books also, since the American editions were often renamed from the British versions, different short story collections were variously titled, etc. etc. In his book, P.G.Wodehouse, in the Thames and Hudson Literary Lives series, Joseph Connolly gives a listing of duplicate books with different titles. I also have a review of that book in the PGW section on Amazon.com for any interested readers.",950227200,,2265,5.1409214092140925
1235782,5,B00000JMQ5,"For some reason, A&E has released the first series of Jeeves & Wooster under different episode names.  The original first series was  available from PBS branded as Mobil Masterpiece Theatre, which is how this  wonderful series first ran in the States.
I made the mistake of  purchasing the first set offered by A&E thinking these were episodes I  did not already have.  Don't you do the same if you already have the  original set from PBS.",941241600,64,439,4.697368421052632

The actors perfectly portray the characters from PG Wodehouse ----- Gussie Fink-Nottle and his newts -- Scary Aunt Agatha --  the soppy mushy Madeline Bassett -- Tuppy Glossop (who is always looking for a quick road to riches), and Bertie's nemesis Roderick Spode (who runs a lady lingerie shop on the side) are some especially great reoccurring characters.  The filming locations are amazing too, Downton Abbey fans may recognize Highclere Castle as one of the majestic houses used in this series.

I can't imagine it could've been done any better--the actors, the theme music, the wardrobe people. I want to say I especially admire the sets, especially when they're in New York City. We know that Wodehouse was stuck in the 30's with this as well as other writings. A fantastic, awesome reflection of this era, in particular the Art Deco.

1235831,5,B00000JMQ5,"Very entertaining, light-hearted comedy about the convoluted exploits of Bertie Wooster, a clueless upper-class man in 1930s England.  Wooster bumbles his merry way through a series of gentle adventures without causing too much damage, thanks mainly to his faithful (and extremely clever) valet, Jeeves.  The lack of violence and only a few very mild British epithets make this a nice show for the whole family.",1473724800,,411,5.3076923076923075

PG Wodehouse, the author of the stories, spent most of his adult life in this country.  His Jeeves and Wooster stories were beloved by many and were incredibly successful.  The TV series (1990-93) is faithful to his writings and anchored brilliantly by actors Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry as they portray the bumbling but lovable upper crust gentleman and his all-knowing, ever efficient valet.  The supporting cast is rich in talent and a testament to perfect casting. The episodes are set in mid 1930's England with hilarious forays to the US.  I think this is comedy at its highest level.

1235857,5,B00000JMQ5,"The first episode I watched was actually season 2, in my experience shows often don't hit their stride right out of the gate. Now, having seen the entire series, I do feel season 2 to be the most acessible, perhaps of the entire run. But here in season 1 we still find the characters we love played to perfection by Mr. Fry and Mr. Laurie, and I laugh out loud at every episode. If you're new to the series, or to Mr. Wodehouse himself, the first episode where our main characters meet is, I think (you may feel free to disagree) a bit less madcap than those that follow, so you might jump in on the second episode. But beware! Many episodes have connecting arcs and plot lines that will be hard to grasp unless seen in the proper order. Now, all of that said, allow me to boil this thing down for you: Jeeves and Wooster as literature is 10 times better than 90% of what you find published today. Jeeves and Wooster as television entertainment is so far above all shows currently running on American television as to be in an entirely different galaxy. So start here, my friend!

1235884,3,B00000JMQ5,"If you enjoy PG Wodehouse then you will undoubtedly know all about this collection. So why are you reading this review.buy it!

If you're unfamiliar with PG well, then you should become familiar with his witty and brilliant writings. This series is Wodehouses most popular. If youve ever wondered where the saying Ask Jeeves came from, this is it.

This series retells the comical mishaps and lost loves of the happy-go-lucky Bertie Wooster. Stephen Fry is the essence of Bertie Wooster and while Id pictured Jeeves to be a bit older Hugh Laurie plays the role perfectly. Im not sure there could ever be a more perfect Bertie and Jeeves.

Unfortunately that is not the case with all the actors in the series. Several of the key characters are played by a different actor throughout the series and it makes it rather hard to keep track of who is who. Its downright frustrating to be honest. And while most episodes are stand alone they build on the other and the characters cross and refer back to earlier events.

And, as good as this TV series is, its NOTHING compared to the books. Still one has to judge each media on its own merits I suppose.

1235950,5,B00000JMQ5,"I tried a number of times to get into this author's work because my friends recommended his work for years. Wit, hilarity, irony are frequent words tossed about in reference to his work. On every prior effort I've failed to ""get it"". I finally got it in two formats to break this impasse, if indeed it was breakable. First, I got the audio version of JEEVES & WOOSTER, narrated by Martin Jarvis and Jonathan Cecil. Then I watched the Video version with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. I am happy to report that I finally ""get"" the humor and fun which readers of Wodehouse have long enjoyed. If you too have had trouble getting into the wit behind the work, I suggest you do the same.

The stories revolve around a well connected English gentleman, Bertie Wooster, who is as idle as can be. There are lords and ladies in his family. He did go to Eton and Oxford and now belongs to all the right clubs. However, the way he behaves, is the way most men of his class behaved in England back in his day, when automobiles were first coming out. You do see Bertie tooling about in his roadster. Bertie is played by Hugh Laurie. This character couldn't be any more different from Doctor Gregory House, especially since Bertie could not figure his way around his own breakfast, much less diagnose someone in dire distress. Bertie is funny but you are most definitely laughing at Bertie, not with him. Hugh Laurie is superb. His is the harder role as he has to come across as likable but not having much but air between his ears.

Jeeves is as opposite from Bertie as can be. Jeeves is of the working class, Bertie's valet. He is suave, intelligent, well read, shrewd and manipulative. Also, he is always calm and collected, never losing his cool. Stephen Fry plays him to perfection. In each and every episode, it is Jeeves who rescues Bertie, his friends or his family members after they have gotten themselves (always) into some ferocious mess of their own making. Just with picking out potential marital partners, they are all utter disasters.

A big part of my problem with Wodehouse and J&W was simply being American. In this same era in America, a well born, well educated man like Bertie would be considered a sluggard for accomplishing nothing. That he could go to (by comparison) Andover and Yale, after being born into a prominent American family, yet be such an idiot that his valet had to do his thinking for him, would not be the making of an American satire! That Bertie and all his friends regard any form of work as beyond the pale is also about as un American a concept as there could be. This classic of wit and satire could only come from England since it revolves around the concept and conceit of the idle English gentleman in that era.",1429747200,3,2745,4.530241935483871

First I checked out A Bit of Fry and Laurie, then on recommendation from a friend saw this.  I hadn't read any of P.G. Wodehouse's books, but this series can easily be enjoyed for what it is without that.  Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are both brilliant in this period comedy, set in the London of the late 1920s.  Hugh Laurie plays Bertie Wooster, a minor aristocrat and part of the monied noblesse, an affable but slightly dimwitted social animal content to navigate the social calendar and hang out at his raucous club, The Drones, with others of his ilk.  But his dragon of a dowager aunt is always pressuring him to marry and arranging for him to meet respectable girls that she finds suitable, but he doesn't.  Enter Stephen Fry as Jeeves, the new valet sent by the agency to Bertie's flat in the first episode.  The quintessential ""gentleman's personal gentleman"", Jeeves is erudite, a brilliant intellect and multitalented.  Time and time again he saves the day for his young employer, masterfully manipulating the overmonied and underoccupied nobility as they hatch harebrained plots and affairs and always seem to drop Bertie into the soup of awkward situations.  The wordplay is masterful, and if period comedies are your thing, then the series is a joy to watch.",1380672000,,1380,4.716666666666667

Wodehouse's Burty Wooster. His partner in comedy, Stephen Fry, is also perfect as the austere and all-knowing butler, Jeeves.

This is English comedy at its very best. Extremely witty and deadpan while at times approaching slapstick. I enjoy it very much.

This acting - this production - of the Bertie Wooster tales is so dashed wonderful that whenever I see Fry or Laurie I can only think of Jeeves and Wooster.

Aside from this, he is a great actor and was a good actor as Wooster, just completely different from House.

Hands down, this was the funniest part of the whole season one.  No, I know, it doesn't sound funny, but it's a visual thing.  Trust me, it's worth it.  I'd give the last two episodes of season one five stars, but the first three earn only three stars because, well, it's a bit of a slow-moving show.  And I'm not just talking about its lack of explosions and other CGI-eye-candy present in most movies and TV shows today (at the expense of a plot, oftentimes).  Even taking into account the style and sly, subtle humor, it took awhile to get warmed up to the characters and get into the show.

There is something delightful about watching something set at such a time, though, when decorum and decency were very different.  And the men's outfits!  So dashing.  Who nowadays wears a three-piece suit to a formal event, let alone every day?  I'm sure there might be historians out there who would quibble with some piece of furniture or cut of a coat (there's always someone who finds somewhere they've slipped up!), but for the lay-person it is quite nicely done and sets the scene wonderfully.

Fry and Laurie do a great job as Jeeves and Wooster, but it's really Bertie Wooster's aunts that steal the show.  Their characters are vibrant and strong (and, well, yes, a bit shrill) and provide a wonderful counter-point to Jeeves's demure intelligence and Wooster's bumbling, but cheerful, incompetence.  The cast works together marvelously, and the plot, while slightly weak and rather in the background, works with the characters.

Both actors were 17 years younger and both were well suited to their respective roles. ""Silly [...]"" Bertie Wooster is a gangling, Eton educated, wealthy young man about town in the thirties in London and around the English countryside and he and his equally foggy cronies amuse themselves with sport, drinking and ""getting up to great wheezes"" which often involve baiting the members of the constabulary and ending up in front of the magistrate. Super suave, intelligent Jeeves is the perfect valet with immaculate taste and far more brain power than Bertie and his chums and is more often than not, the means of getting them out of scrapes.

Not that these are bad.  There are some laughs.  But there is much hostile humor here, and Wodehouse's comedy is typically good-natured, feel-good comedy, as it is uniformly in Wodehouse Playhouse.

Also, Wodehouse's women are as odd and as funny as his men, but today they would be politically incorrect.  The screenwriter here obviously removed all the political incorrectness from these women but did not put any characterization in its place.  The result is blah, boring women characters.

Wodehouse started the Mulliner stories twenty years after he started the Jeeves series.  Maybe he'd learned a thing or two.

Also, of course, it is hard to equal Pauline Collins and John Alderton.

Bottom line: if you haven't seen either series, Wodehouse Playhouse is a much better bet.  If you've already seen some of the Jeeves comedies, go straight to Wodehouse Playhouse and save your money.

Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is a well-to-do young Britisher who spends his time in idle fun.  Jeeves (Stephen Fry) is a valet (gentleman's gentleman) who's much smarter than his master and keeps his charge out of trouble.

The first episode is a typical Wooster scene.  He's in court for playing a minor prank, so hung over he can't talk.  He somehow manages to direct a cab to get him home and who shows up on his door, but Jeeves.  Jeeves has been sent by the agency to be his valet.  Jeeves gets Wooster his patented hangover remedy, turns a disreputable flat into organization in short order.

1236217,5,B00000JMQ5,"P.G. Wodehouse wrote some of the most beloved stories in the twentieth century, including dozens of short stories and a number of novels of probably his most famous characters, the fopish Bertie Wooster and his brilliant valet, Reginald Jeeves.  Those stories were the basis of this wonderful collection of episodes in the first season of Jeeves and Wooster.

Set in Bertie's flat in London and various other locales around England, including the wonderfully named Drone's Club, the episodes revolve around Jeeve's always successful machinations that rescue Bertie from one scrape or another, frequently involving real or imagined relationships with a variety of mainly unsuitable women who travel in the same upperclass world as does Bertie.  Bertie is indeed doubly lucky; first, to be born to wealth, allowing his ineptitude to do no real damage to himself or others, and secondly, to aquire the services of his valet, Jeeves, whose cleverness is the epitome of the helpful servant.

Hugh Laurie, now quite well-known as Dr. House on the highly-regarded Fox network medical drama 'House', plays Bertie with a knack for physical comedy and a wide range of facial expression that perfectly convey the emotions of a man totally at the mercy of strong-willed women, particularly his aunts and a variety of young marriagable women.  Bertie sees no need to ever marry, since he has a wide circle of hilariously-named friends called Bingo and Gussy Finklenottle.

Wodehouse obviously loved to tweak the noses of the totally clueless upperclass members of British society.  We see the extremely large houses where the aristocrats lived; thanks to Wodehouse we can safely laugh at their foolishness.

Wodehouse's humor is definitely British, physical, and simply wonderful.  I have purchased this set and all the other episodes of Jeeves and Wooster, and I've watched them several times.  I'm happy to report that they hold up extremely well to repeated viewing.

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry expertly fill in the ditzy aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his stoic ultra-brain manservant Jeeves. Hilarious writing, great casting, insanely complicated storylines that make ""Seinfeld"" look like a walk in the part.
""Jeeves Takes Charge"" when Bertram Wilberforce Wooster advertises for a new valet (the old one kept stealing his socks). As Bertie becomes accustomed to Jeeves, he is also being sent to the country to (theoretically) woo Honoria Glossop, a woman so hearty and athletic that she slaps Bertie right off his feet. To make things more complicated, one of Bertie's pals is in love with Honoria, and Bertie's two crazy cousins are stealing stuff.
""Tuppy and the Terrier"" includes Bertie planning to propose to the mischievous Bobbie Wickham, a move that rapidly gets him into hot water (specifically, a hot water bottle punctured by a needle) -- but not as much hot water as he'll be in when Aunt Agatha finds out that Bobbie gave away her beloved dog. Meanwhile, Bertie's pal Tuppy Glossop has fallen in love with a snooty opera singer and dumped Bertie's cousin...
""The Purity of the Turf"" is soiled when Bertie's uncle falls in love with a waittress. Aunt Agatha's orders that Bertie bribe the girl away work -- and don't work -- and the resulting threat of imminent death sends Bertie and Jeeves into the countryside. There they start up a gambling syndicate at a fete where betting of all kinds is off-limits.
""Brinkley Manor""'s ""Hunger Strike"" goes horribly wrong when Bertie's cousin Angela breaks up with Tuppy, and newt-obsessed Gussie Fink-Nottle falls in love with the soppy Madeleine Basset (she believes the stars are God's daisy chain -- how about that?). Bertie offers advice to the lovelorn young men, only to have Madeleine assume that he is in love with her, and Tuppy assumes that he is in love with Angela. Anatole the cook also quits. And Jeeves is Bertie's last hope. before Madeleine marries him and Aunt Dahlia murders him.
P.G. Wodehouse's novels spoof the idle rich, and you may come out of it thankful that these people had too much time on their hands. Timid young men, carnivorous aunts, a guy obsessed with newts, another guy who falls in love with every girl he comes across, a stuffed moose, uncles in the throes of midlife crises, incredibly smart butlers, and young women who accept a marriage proposal that was never made -- if anything here strikes you as funny, this will be perfect. Hugh Laurie is perfect as the gangly, amiable Bertie Wooster (who's too accomodating for his own good) and Stephen Fry is quietly, dryly humorous as the opinionated valet Jeeves.

fast forward 15 years. i'm stuck with the onerous task of driving from houston to los angeles (or vice versa, who remembers such things?) so i pick up the audiobook of 'the inimitable jeeves'. fortunately i have learned to laugh without doubling over, otherwise i would be in a mangled pile of german engineering somewhere in new mexico.
as soon as i reached houston (yeah now i recall), i jumped onto amazon and ordered this dvd set. wouldn't you know that i had to move to atlanta before amazon delivered it. so i ended up buying an audiobook of 'baudalino' to last me from atlanta to houston where i finally picked up 'jeeves & wooster'.
it was with great relish that i finally vewied the stories, many of which were picked from 'the inimitable'. i was fully satisfied. these are, go get a tub of moo goo gai pan and a smirnoff ice, fluff your pillows and get ready to laugh stories. the kind of entertainment you really enjoy. it was all i could do not to watch all of the episodes at once.

Stephen Fry (Jeeves) and Hugh Laurie (Wooster) are well-known English comedians. They both had major roles in the Blackadder series and Laurie starred in Stuart Little. Here, Laurie plays Bertie Wooster, an air-headed young English aristocrat, a character exactly like his Blackadder roles, and Fry plays Jeeves, Bertie's valet, a man of sophistication and cunning, equally at home in the sitting room of a county manor or in a rowdy East End mission. A character completely unlike any Fry played in Blackadder.
The series is set in the 1930's, and is rich with period atmosphere. Poor addled Bertie may be rich, debauched and carefree, but he forever seems to be getting into social trouble with either his aunts or his eccentric school chums. The punch line every time is that, after Bertie has made such a pig's breakfast of things that you can't imagine he'll ever be invited to anyone's mansion for dinner again, Jeeves comes up with a simple and elegant resolution. Along the way, we are treated to crisp, witty dialog, in the best British tradition. I particularly enjoyed Jeeves's reaction to the mess jacket he finds in Bertie's clothes closet:
""I assumed it had gotten into your wardrobe by accident...or else been placed there by your enemies.""
Bertie protests. ""I wore this jacket at Cannes, Jeeves, and all the young ladies tried to catch my eye.""
""No doubt they mistook you for a waiter, sir.""
The striking thing about this series (unlike, say, Blackadder) is that it will keep you laughing without the slightest sexual innuendo or a smidgeon of violence (unless you count Bertie's golf game). You could show this whole series at a Sunday School picnic and no one would blush.
How many comedies can you say *that* about?",1023840000,32,2008,4.80635838150289
1236243,5,B00000JMQ5,"I was a rabid Wodehouse fan before I saw any of the Jeeves and Wooster episodes, and feared disappointment. I needn't have worried. It's obvious that true love and affection for the great Plum went into these gems. If you like your British humor on the subtle side, with some absurdity bunged in without warning, you must own this set. Stephen Fry is perfect as Jeeves, and Hugh Laurie is lovable and believable as the hapless but well-intentioned Bertie, who spends his time attempting to avoid hellish aunts and horsy, corn-fed females determined to lead him to the altar. You'll love it!",1020038400,2,590,4.794117647058823
1236244,4,B00000JMQ5,"I love the Jeeves and Wooster series and highly recommend them to all but with a caveat.... Not for the hearing impaired! I bought my parents two of the series along with a DVD player for Christmas, my mother needs closed captioning for television viewing, imagine my surprise to find no closed captioning or a sub-title option. I was very surprised.",1018915200,3,350,4.754098360655738
1236245,3,B00000JMQ5,"I love this series -- the acting, the timing, the comedy; some of the best British humor I've seen. It absolutely pains me to drop it to three stars from five, and it lies completely on the head of A&E for removing the already-present Closed Captioning track, so those of us with hearing disabilities cannot fully enjoy it. I was so looking forward to buying the entire DVD collection, too.",1014595200,20,390,4.585714285714285
1236246,4,B00000JMQ5,"A perfect cast anchors these clearly brilliant and nearly faithful adaptations of P. G. Wodehouse's sparkling, narrow prose portraits.  If you have affection for the British you will love these none-too-gentle digs at the noblesse, as it were.  Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are sublime, perfect in every way, and they are backed up by a gifted group.  The screenplay is delightful.  The sets are lush.
All that brilliance aside, the DVD is disappointing.  Surely someone has some reminiscences?  Home video of the wrap party?  Anything would be lovely.  The carton back reads:  ""DVD Features: Interactive Menus, Scene Selection""  Oh, how very kind.
The material easily gets 5 stars, but the DVD package falls short of what consumers have come to expect.",1011744000,5,752,5.090163934426229

1236249,5,B00000JMQ5,"I always heard about how wonderful Jeeves and Wooster was but I held back on buying it since I had no idea if it was to my taste. At last, I decided to give it a try and was delighted by the witty dialogue, the marvelous set-ups and the back-and-forth between the very talented leads.
To anyone who wants to try this series but is not sure, it is marvelous. From the first bars of the catchy theme song (which gets stuck in your head) I was totally in love. The comedic style reminded me of the screwball comedies of the 1930s, the era in which this series is set.
A must for Anglophiles, fans of older comedy and people looking for good, clean humor.
My favorite episode is the first one but every episode in the set in a minor comic masterpiece. Try it and you will not be sorry.",1001030400,5,781,4.178807947019868
1236250,5,B00000JMQ5,"I bitterly regret not having seen the series when it was on television and waiting all these years to experience such visual joy. The sets and costumes are sublime. The actors were certainly born to play their roles. Hugh Laurie is divine, handsome, charming witty, urbane and erudite exactly as I have imagined Bertie to be in all the many years I've been reading Wodehouse.
I can't stop watching the tapes. I'm hoplessly under Bertie's thrall.",997228800,4,445,4.868421052631579
1236251,5,B00000JMQ5,"Jeeves and Wooster may not have the production quality of a Merchant Ivory film, but it's got funnier stories and twice the laughs per minute. At 250 minutes between the five episodes that turns out to be quite a rib tickling time.  Readers of the Jeeve's novels are no doubt aware of the difficulties of reproducing Wodehouse's stories verbatim, but these chaps have made a bally good show of it. The stories that inspired writers like Douglas Adams, Ben Elton, and Richard Curtis (as well as the films of Blake Edwards) are done admirable service here. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are every bit as funny as they are in Black Adder's tales. The scenery is authentic (since they filmed the series in England) and the supporting casts are wonderful. I enjoyed them like a very enjoyable thing with a slice of lemon.",986256000,7,814,4.6923076923076925
