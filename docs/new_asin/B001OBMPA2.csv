8330301,1,B001OBMPA2,"This film contains no information about astrology. It contains music, scenery and the story of an attractive young woman going through a breakup. Mixed in with the story line are a number of experts making big claims and promises. No explanation or evidence was offered. It was, in short, an infomercial.",1346630400,2,304,4.980392156862745
8330302,5,B001OBMPA2,"This is a brilliantly constructed video with many excellent components.

It teaches a lot about astrology through a good storyline that the astrologer-
director Kelly Lee Phipps creates.  Also there are hours of interviews with some
of the world's best and most enjoyable astrologers.  Excellent.

P.S.  I am an astrologer myself and learned so much.",1299110400,7,350,5.290909090909091
