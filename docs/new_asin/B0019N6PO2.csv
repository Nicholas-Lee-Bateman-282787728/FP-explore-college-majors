3441701,3,B0019N6PO2,"This is a good suspense thriller that veers on the Jason/ Michael Myers turf as to how many times can a killer come back. It is also loosely based on the Andrea Yates case.

The promotional quote is a little contrived...it states it's based on true events.....postpartum depression and mental illness is a true event, and murder, but this movie is a dramatic extreme. So for those who leave this film thinking this story really happened...think again. Andrea Yates happened...and although her crime was violent, this film heads into slasher territory

But, if you look at it as a horror/ thriller...it's pretty good. All the actors pulled their respective parts off well...even the little kids. Things get really intense, and you know the murder is happening, but the kids are not being shown directly murdered, but the adults who are murdered are shown.

On the negative side, some of the dialogue from the mother was all twisted ""mommolies"" [stuff your mom might say] said as she was commiting the crimes on her children. It just seemed too odd and out of place. That alone helped move the movie towards a Freddy Kruger slasher aspect as he usually had something clever to say as he murdered. In this film, it took away from the punch.

It becomes clear early in the film that the father is pretty much independent from the family. He is home a few days, but does nothing to help with the four kids. When his wife sends him clear signal that all is not well with her, he tunes it out. She needs to feel pretty and loved, and he's in a walking coma towards her and the needs of his eldest sone to be at an all important ball game.

3441709,5,B0019N6PO2,"Baby Blues (Lars E. Jacobson and Amardeep Kaleka, 2008)

I've watched a lot of movies-- probably way too many-- over the past couple of weeks, from the sublime to the ridiculous, and all points in between. Baby Blues a little straight-to-video thriller that just recently hit the shelves, may be the best of them. This is the reason I watch so many awful horror films-- because every once in a while, I find a microbudget movie that impresses me more than almost anything I've seen from the major studios in the past five years. There was Shallow Ground. There was Deadbirds. Now there is Baby Blues.

Jimmy (The Bad News Bears remake's Ridge Canipe) is a rural fourteen-year-old with problems. He's not quite the town bully, but he's not a model kid, either. His dad (Anonymity's Joel Bryant) is a long-distance trucker who's around, it seems, just long enough to get his mom (I Know Who Killed Me's Colleen Porch) pregnant every once in a while; as we open, Jimmy is one of four kids, the youngest an infant, and mom is suffering some serious post-natal depression, which is augmented by a distressingly rapid slide into full-out madness. Dad has to make a run to Tallahassee, and not long after he gets out of sight, Mom snaps for good. This, as it turns out, is a very, very bad thing for her children. Jimmy finds himself in the uncomfortable position of having to protect his younger siblings from their mother's murderous wrath.

Make no mistake, this is an exceedingly dark movie, and one that will disturb and offend many viewers, but it gets its power by the fact that it's frighteningly well-acted and very well directed by first-timers Jacobson and Kaleka, who have obviously done their homework better than most of the first-time directors working within the system these days. This is just shy of being the perfect thriller; the opening scenes are a bit on the slow side, but once Jacobson and Kaleka (who also wrote the screenplay) crank up the tension, it never once lets go. The current theory that humorous interludes punctuating the horror is certainly workable in the right hands, but this is a movie that shows that unrelenting tension can work even better under the right circumstances. These are the right circumstances. Keeping in mind my warning above-- there are many who will find the basis of the story (which is, supposedly, based on a true incident) offensive to even think about, let alone see depicted on a screen-- I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. See this, and see it soon. **** ",1223596800,9,2525,4.757990867579909
3441710,5,B0019N6PO2,"Lars E. Jacobson wrote this movie and the box claims it is based on a true story.  Which true story its based on or inspired by is not relevant.  What is relevant is that Lars E. Jacobson understands what makes a movie horrifying.  The plot to this movie is pretty straightforward.  A woman, known only as Mom, convincingly portrayed by Colleen Porch, gives birth to her baby boy and begins a descent into madness and psychosis created by the all too common condition, post-partum depression.  She begins to see things in drawings made by the children.  She believes her husband, an over-the-road trucker who is gone frequently, is cheating on her.  And of course, she begins to kill her children, one by one.  Ok.. enough said about the plot because too much more would spoil this movie if you haven't seen it.  And from what I can tell this film isn't trying to make any sort of social statement about post-partum depression. But, many of us know the story of Andrea Yates and mothers like her that simply snapped and killed all of their children in a post-partum depression induced psychosis.  Thus this story is all too real and thus all too disturbing.

My wife and I cringed and turned out heads throughout this movie.  But not because it is terribly gorey or bloody, we love gore and blood. We turned our heads, much as a young child covers his eyes when the monster comes up, to avoid the truly scary parts of this film -- the mother in her madness killing her children.  My wife actually pulled our 3 year old son up on to her lap and held him as this woman brutally murdered these children.  The film was simply brutal and horrifying.  Rarely does a film kill young children, but this one does it, does it in a horrifying and realistic manner, and does it in front of other young children.

The boy who plays the 10 year old son, Jimmy, who does everything he can to protect his siblings from the mother's rage is the actor Ridge Canipe.  He is phenomenal.  I can't imagine this film won't have a lasting effect on his psyche.  The Mom is so believably potrayed by Colleen Porch that I'm quite sure when I see her in other movies I'll immediately have flashbacks to the terror of this film.  The cinematography is phenomenal.  The directors (Lars Jacobson and Amadreep Kaleka) create many very scary scenes and shots throughout the film. For example, there is one scene where Jimmy is hiding in the chicken coop and his mother, on her knees, looks into the chicken coop through the small entrance used by the chickens, and the look on her face and its framing in the doorway was most reminiscent of the classic Jack shot from Kubrick's THE SHINING.

Although I strongly recommend everyone watch this movie, we will likely never watch this movie again.  The movie was simply too psychologically disturbing for the loving parents of three children to endure once more.  This horror is real.  There is no slasher, there is no zombie, there is no vampire nor werewolf, that is as real as Mom is in BABY BLUES.

As I don't really have a regular rating system that I use to give a film 5 out of 5 stars or whatever, I'll just say whatever rating system you want to use I give it all of them .. 5/5 stars, 10/10 skulls, 5/5 Holy Craps, whatever the case may be.  The movie has it all, a great story, great acting, great cinematography, a perfect balance of blood and gore in its kill scenes, and great directing.",1220572800,6,3415,4.501623376623376
3441711,4,B0019N6PO2,"Even in horror cinema there has always been an underlying rule; CHILDREN BELOW THE AGE OF 15 SHALL NEVER BE KILLED!  Of course a few films have been able to cross that boundary and become all the better for it(I'm talking about the raft scene from The Burning and the finale to Who Can Kill A Child as sparkling examples), but for the most part it just isn't done, and usually it isn't neccessary either... I mean, as long as someone's being slaughtered what do we horror junkies care the age, right?  Well Baby Blues can not only be added to the short list of films that successfully cross that aforementioned line, but it spanks it raw and throws it in ""time-out"" for added measure!  That statement right there should get my more depraved horror brethren salivating as well as provide fair warning to everyone else... this movie is NOT for the faint of heart.  For the overly sensitive(and for those types I'll say it for you, ""anyone who likes this movie is a certified sicko and should be ashamed of themselves""... there, now you don't have to leave that comment at the bottom of my review) or the type that can't seem to differentiate film from real life, you may want to steer clear... rent the incredibly safe(and dumb) Prom Night remake or any number of other tame Hollywood horror films currently littering your local rental joint instead(and watch out for that killer!  Oh, *whew* it was just a cat... LOL!).  So Baby Blues puts the all-too-real condition of postpartum depression(severe depression after delivery of a baby) to film, and in the process creates one of the best horror films of the year... and maybe most surprising of all, it's an American movie(I was begining to think only France was churning out movies like this anymore?)!  Follow 10-year-old Jimmy, and his 3 younger siblings(one a newborn) as they flee from the most unexpected of evils... their own mother!  The plot is set, however since this is a low-budget independent feature, acting and the directors ability become incredibly vital to whether or not the film will ""sink or swim(much like the baby in this flick... wow, that's a tasteless joke even for my standards!).""  Thankfully Baby Blues excels in both departments, particularly Colleen Porch as the mother who has lost sight of the boundaries between right and wrong, her perfomance is a revelation and should springboard her career onto bigger things(to which she'll probably do interviews stating how she ""regrets making this film""), while the duo of directors come off far better then a couple of recent film grads on their debut project(which they are), creating some intense moments of cat-and-mouse and getting believable performances out of the children in the cast(which can't be easy).  Now there are a few missteps that keep Baby Blues from reaching it's complete potential, a 71 minute runntime is one problem to be sure, especially when a lacking need in the film is for the mother to be more fleshed-out before losing her mind... the same is known about her at the start of the movie as in the end, she's looney!  Another issue I have is that it doesn't take full advantage of it's subject matter, what starts off incredibly dark and uncomfortable takes a slight turn into campier material(when the film flips from the mother weeping and trying to drown her kids in the bathtub, to running them down with a corn thresher while spouting off about Hansel & Gretel deserving to be cooked alive?!), and a tacked on ending that, although provides a creepy closing shot, is about as believable as a razor-gloved killer who attacks you through dreams.  All said though, Baby Blues should be on the top of most self-respecting horror fans list of movies to see in the near future(and by near future I mean right now!) and is not only one of the best of 2008, but of the new millenium so far... so put the kids(safely!) to bed and check this out!",1220140800,8,3894,4.744082840236686

8274770,5,B0019N6PO2,"I'm surprised I haven't heard more about this movie.  In fact, I can't even remember from if where it was I first heard about it.  I remember getting it off Netflix back when I still did the DVD/mail thing and was happy to find it here for relatively inexpensive.  It's not one you buy and keep to rewatch repeatedly.  You buy it to HAVE and so you can lend it out when people start talking about bizarre or intense or WTF movies.  Luckily the back of the DVD keeps the majority of the main plot details vague.  But it strikes me as such an unknown film I'm guessing anyone reading this already knows what it's about.  It's a low budget horror flick with children as the main protagonists so of course the acting isn't going to knock your socks off, but none of the adult actors are cringe worthy or anything and the kids aren't half bad either.  They definitely know how to convey fear without becoming annoying.  With a movie concerning this messed-up a subject matter the last you want to be doing it rooting for the kids to get it.  Because SPOILERS!!!, once they do you might feel like a jerk.

The main actress does a great job with the role and isn't afraid to just go with it even when it starts to get really over-the-top.  She's convincing and creepy and she's, in my mind, up there with, maybe not Mrs Voorhees but definitely Mary Lou Maloney, and the other B horror bad ladies.  She even gets to babble out some campy killer bon mots.

The movie goes places you rarely see horror flicks go rather early, but the shock wears off quickly and then it settles nicely into your typical horror chase thing.  Luckily it's not even over 80 mins so it's over before it wears out its welcome.  Also, the cinematography is better than you'd expect, especially the daytime scenes of farm life and rural southern landscapes that come off as dreamy and vaguely sinister.

So it boils down to a bit o nasty and effective exploitation of a topic that might borderline on the tasteless or some.  Personally, I thought it was a pretty original topic ripe for a slasher flick and one I can't believe hadn't been done sooner (or since?  Are there more like this?).

Directed by Lars Jacobson and Amardeep Kaleka and released in 2008. Baby Blues is a very disturbing film that covers one of the most horrible acts that can be committed by humans, filicide. The film is based on Andrea Bates; the woman who drowned her five children one at a time in Houston, Texas. The film follows the same premise, but it utilizes the slasher run and chase formula.

When coming into this film prepare yourself to be disturbed. Baby Blues attempts to cross the line and succeeds by having the murders take place with toddlers. The film works its horror edge to the fullest by utilizing its characters. The children and mother deliver some fine performances. I was actually able to feel the children's terror and the mothers insanity.

The film is low budget but it delivers where it counts. The gore isn't very graphic, and at least one child death scene is very brutal. The children are brutally killed. However, the murders are delivered off screen and the film accomplishes what it sets out for.

There's no CGI in the murders and one death takes place in the dark. I also enjoyed the set pieces which took place in high vegetation and within a barn. The set pieces delivered the right amount of lighting to display the sinister feel, which was caught by the blue moonlight. I won't say that the film was heavy on atmosphere, but the tension was higher than what it should have been. Mainly because the victims were children, and no one wants to see a child killed in any way. Had this exact same element taken place with booze drinking teens. It never would've had the same effect. Especially, during a time when the horror genre is so over-saturated with young adults being murdered, and trying to hide in the clumsiest of places.

The pacing of the film was excellent for quite some time, but this chase grew a bit too long and began to follow the typical slasher routine; such as a character whom was introduced and killed off just because. The plot really began to fall by the end and the ending itself just wasn't to my liking.

Baby Blues could have been a great character driven horror film, if only it went the route focusing on wicked human nature or mental illness. My biggest problem with the film was the writers trying to make it more than that, by presenting the possibility of a supernatural element which was delivered through visions and flashes. There are obvious references to the supernatural influence of scarecrows. I can probably explain on how Baby Blues was nothing more than 85 minutes of Jacobson and Kaleka completely missing the point, when concerning the mythology behind scarecrows. Instead, I'll avoid doing so as not to lower my rating, and completely ignore everything else the film did a great job on.

I believe the possibility of an evil outside force reduced the seriousness of the film as well. Baby Blues is a film that wants to be taken seriously. I mean after all it features children under 10 being killed. That's pretty serious if you ask me. Therefore, I feel the film would have worked out a lot better had the mothers rage been more natural instead of supernatural. This way the message to the film wouldn't be as distorted as I see it right now because let's face it, people who suffer from mental problems are among us and I seriously doubt that some demon from hell is the culprit.

Overall, I recommend Baby Blues only to real horror fans and when I say real horror fans; I'm talking about those who understand that most of the point to horror films is to be disturbed. Either through atmosphere or a majority of the time through people committing heinous acts such as murder.

I've seen this film blasted only because it's disturbing and has death in it. I could never drill this into my head. Why would an individual invest time and money into a horror film only to later complain that it's disturbing? It's mind boggling and I'll never understand it. Baby Blues is a disturbing film. If you know child murder is something you can never digest, then skip this film without hesitation.

Pros: Very disturbing, good setting, solid acting, good pacing

Cons: Unrealistic ending, loses a lot of steam towards the end, very questionable plot element",1412380800,,4910,4.689895470383275

Besides the horrifying plot the film goes way over the top with the blood and gore, as if the story wasn't disturbing enough. As for the acting, well it's about as horrific as the storyline, I honestly think the children may have written some of their own lines.

8274775,4,B0019N6PO2,"BABY BLUES is a horror movie that is more frightening because the monster is all too real---post partum depression.  As Andrea Yates and Susan Smith have painfully reminded us, this depression is devastating and can turn an ordinary woman into a heartless killing machine.
Colleen Porch is absolutely chilling as the young mother of four children whose truck driver husband wants to go for five, not cognizant of the fact his wife is crumbling before his eyes.  What transpires in BABY BLUES is disturbing and hard to watch.  Ridge Canipe is heartbreakingly stunning as Jimmy, the oldest son facing the woman who once was his mother.
