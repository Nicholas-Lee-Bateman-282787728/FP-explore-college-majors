Thumbs up!",1391385600,,119,4.95
8406526,4,B003VADRVA,These two movies are very touching.  The Christmas Choir is inspiring on how a little faith and belief in others can change lives.  The Chistmas Hope is sad but very good on showing how people deal with grief and later come to terms with it.,1358985600,,241,4.333333333333333
8406527,5,B003VADRVA,I like both of these movies and that is why I ordered them. They are very warm and encouraging especially during this time of year.,1323129600,,131,4.28
8406528,5,B003VADRVA,"I love all of these Christmas ""tear-jerker"" movies.  I have the complete set now, including Christmas Shoes and Christmas Blessing.  It's these type of movies that should not be watched just at Christmastime but anytime, especially if you want a movie to lift you up.  It really demonstrates the true meaning of Christmas, about giving and caring about others.",1295568000,,360,5.067796610169491
