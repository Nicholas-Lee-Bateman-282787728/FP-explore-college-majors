347001,4,6301590740,"This rather brilliant dark comedy had so few interesting reviews online I thought I would help it out a bit with my own observations, especially since few reviewers seems to mention the last scene which, to me, is key and shifts the whole movie and its meaning to another level. One can, and should, watch this movie for a variety of good reasons: Peter Sellers subtle performance, Hal Ashbys quirky direction, or the fine supporting performances by Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas, and Richard Dysart.

First, I LOVE Hal Ashbys classic cult film Harold and Maude, another dark comedy, so I think I can understand his intent in this movie as well. Its clearly a satire on our modern television saturated culture, so sharp and inclusive that you can see a little Trumpism in Chases blank canvas appeal to the American political and social elite. I would argue that it is actually more than that and can be seen as a critique of the kind of mysticism where when we go in search of God only to find ourselves.

Spoiler alert: Im about to summarize the last scene and if you haven't seen the movie yet, read this review before watching and mine afterward if you're still interested.

A summary of the last scene: Chance (Peter Sellers) is at the funeral for his friend and benefactor, Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas), and he wanders off across the fields in his natty suit as the pall bearers discuss their plans to use him to hang on to power by getting him elected president (like Trump was, some might say). As Chase wanders over hills and next to a pond, fondling a small pine tree and looking around at the gardena cemetery, don't forgethe turns away from the camera and begins to walk across the water. You know, like Jesus in the Bible? It has become metaphor for doing the impossible. So is Chase a stand-in for Christ or God?

To back up a bit, we can look at what other characters are saying about Chase. They project on his rambling non-sequiturs a kind of earthy wisdom. The other characters think his answers on every thing from questions on the American economy to deeply personal existential questions are profound and metaphorical. To them, like Jesus, he speaks in what most people in the film think are gardening metaphors, as in the Garden of Eden kind of garden. The dramatic irony here: we know hes not being profound. He actually is talking about gardening, the only thing he knows. But, much like the human search for meaning where there is none, they project meaning into his garden talk, the long pauses and empty spaces of his utterances.

Other events that bring to mind the mistaken God-consciousness are when Ben Rand tells the doctor that he feels OK to die as long as Chauncey is around. His wife, Eve (another Garden of Eden reference?), has a life-changing orgasm without Chase even touching her when he tells her he likes to watch and then doesnt, which becomes one of the funniest sex scenes in cinematic history. Notice that each of the other main characters (except the doctor) uses Chase, and his God-like inaction and blank, innocent and strangely inviting stare as a canvas upon which they write their dreams, desires and ambitions. He only reflects, hes not really there. Thus the titles irony.

One the few clear-eyed characters in the film is Dr. Allenby, played by Richard Dysart. As a man of science he doesnt quite fall for Chances empty metaphors and blank stares as some sort of wisdom. He recognizes Chance for what he is: just a not-too-bright gardener. But at the point where hes just about to spill the beans on Chance, he realizes the old mans fondness for him and backs off of telling him the truth after Rand tells Allenby that he feels OK to die with Chance around. He allows a dying man his comfort, much as any humanitarian would.

I highly recommend this film. Its sly humor and ironic tone are delightful and each of the cast members is brilliant in his or her own way. The film is quietly witty and humorous in a way that only a Hal Ashby film can be.",1517616000,,4008,4.612903225806452

347039,5,6301590740,"The film Being There has some brilliant acting from multiple people all around. In Being There, the character of Chauncey Gardiner, a.k.a Chance the Gardner (Pete Sellers) ends up starting all over after the death of his employer. The viewer is getting a glimpse into Chances persona when a coworker tells him of his employers passing. The fact that he has never ventured outside of his employers home is the least of his challenges when he is told by some lawyers handling his estate that he has to move out of his employers home by the next day. The viewer is left wondering how things are going to go for Chance until he is unexpectedly hit by a car with Eve Rand (Shirley Maclaine) and owned by her husband wealthy businessman Ben Rand. There are multiple brilliant acting performances all around yet I have to admit that I thought the acting portrayal of Eve Rand was very moving/heartfelt because of the hospitality she showed to who she mistakes for Chauncey Gardiner (Chance the Gardener) while dealing with the emotions she has while coping with the situation involving her husband Ben Rand who even with her misgivings she clearly loves. Regardless of how I may be perceived for writing this, I do believe that a person can learn more about the world around them/become wiser regardless of their age, it just may take more effort from some compared to others depending on the type of life a person is living and the environment they voluntarily choose to reside in. However, I was surprised to see Eve Rand react that way she did around Ben Rand only because it is common knowledge both many men and women romantically crave someone who is somewhat at least on the same level of intelligence or greater, the same level of being intuitive andor greater andor the same level of self-confidence or greater self confidence as them. I understand how abrasive this may sound, it is just that I had to give a disclaimer to others to imply the level of an open mind a person must keep to watching this. Even to this day, many mainstream articles (even from spiritual sources andor even from respected andor prestigious sources) preface the type of job andor socio-economic status a person has in order to imply the worthiness of the article. I am complain free while saying this, Im just implying the way of the beast common knowledge wise.  Chauncey Gardiner becomes very popular, has an esteemed reputation in even the high society circles of the Washington D.C. area and not one person is able to dig up anything juicy about his past. Even a male employee connected to the Washington Post tries to dig up something gossip-worthy for mainstream fame yet he causes a female employee to quit when he presses for her to do it and she tried to make it clear that trying to dig up any history on Chauncey Gardiner is in vain. The Washington Post reporter felt compelled to dig up some info after noticing Chauncey Gardiners reputation bringing him fame after the President (Jack Warden) quotes him in a speech. The only man who seems to know the truth about Chauncey Gardiner is Dr. Robert Allenby (Richard Dysart). However, Dr. Allenby holds back from telling his employer Ben Rand the truth in order to protect Rands morale and high spirits. The end of the movie ruthlessly skewers politics by the way a group of men have a discussion around politics and how this ties into the main character (played by Peter Sellers). Even I know to be very careful what online andor offline sources(such as television) that I comment on andor share yet fortunately it is because of both knowledge gleaned from my undergraduate college years and my interest in public relations/advertising trends that help inform my discernment. For these reasons alone, I strive to avoid judging others who are still learning discernment even as I am guilty of playing along with some of the online sources that Im aware are targeted to me for certain reasons. I refrain from saying more as a woman such as myself has to keep some secrets as to how to tell which online andor offline sources that are worth me looking at and which ones are better left for others.",1512259200,,4134,4.702068965517241

He went back for yet another but I decided two viewings gave me more than enough to ponder.

The colors look sharper, the detail is better and it preserves the grain of the film stock to give it a wonderfully textured look.

The Making of Being There features interviews with producer Andrew Braunsberg, screenwriter Robert C. Jones, cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, and editor Don Zimmerman. They talk about how the film came together, from buying the rights to the book to getting Hal Ashby onboard. Author Jerzy Kosinski was uncompromising and originally wanted to write and direct the adaptation himself but Braunsberg managed to convince him otherwise. Ashby wanted Peter Sellers cast as Chance and didn't consider anyone else. This is an excellent look at how the film came together by those that worked on it.

Hal Ashby at the AFI is an audio excerpt from a 1980 seminar that the filmmaker gave at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. He takes questions and addresses things like the films famous ending and working with Sellers, explaining how the actor put the character together.

Jerzy Kosinski and Dick Cavett is an appearance the former made on the latters T.V. talk show in 1979 to promote Being There. As typical with Cavett, this is an in-depth and engaging conversation that provides Kosinskis take on his involvement in the adaptation of his novel into a film.

Peter Sellers features two T.V. show appearances he made promoting Being There. The first is the Today show with Gene Schalit. He talks about his uncanny knack for accents and what film he enjoyed working on the most. Then, he makes an appearance on The Don Lane Show from Australia. Sellers talks about how he got involved in the film and what drew him to the character of Chance.

There are two deleted scenes, an alternate ending and outtakes. The excised footage doesnt add much and its easy to see why it was cut. The alternate ending seems more conventional, lacking the enigmatic wonder of the one that was used. The outtakes were shown under the closing credits and see Sellers repeatedly breaking character.

Promo Reel features Ashby and Sellers in a promotional piece for the film. They joke around in this fun piece.

Finally, there is a trailer and T.V. spots.",1499299200,,2440,5.241025641025641
347108,1,6301590740,"Review of ""Being There""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

This is a pretty famous movie, but I don't agree with any of the reasons why it was so well-received. If you really want to watch it, go ahead. Just know what you're getting into.

Reason 1: Peter Sellars gives a tour-de-force performance. I don't agree. Yes, hes usually known for playing hilarious roles, but Being There wasn't his first or only dramatic performance. For a truly great dramatic performance from Sellars, watch Hoffman. In Being There, he gives one dull expression, and its far from impressive.

Reason 2: Melvyn Douglas gives an Academy Award winning performance. Technically, thats true; he won the Oscar in 1980, but I thought it was undeserved. In this movie, he was 78 years old, and unfortunately, his aging process had rendered him unrecognizable. I felt very sad watching his performance; he was very frail. I have great respect for actors who continue working through their old age, but I didn't see a very powerful performance in this case.

Reason 3: Shirley MacLaine is dynamite. I love Shirley MacLaine, but I don't even understand why she took this role. Call me old-fashioned, but decades of filmmaking during the Hays Code proved actresses were able to show off every talent without taking their clothes off or doing a sex scene. Ive never been impressed by someones acting talents because of an R rating. Im not spoiling anything, because this is far from being a critical plot point, but theres a scene in the movie where Shirley MacLaine, well, does herself a favor. Im convinced one of the only reasons why this movie got any attention at all was because of this scene.

Reason 4: The plot is deep and poignant. I don't agree. Being There is about a simple-minded gardener who soaks up and believes what the television shows him. I don't think thats very deep; I think hes just simple-minded. Due to a misunderstanding, the gardener is believed to be a rich, intelligent businessman. People take his simple statements to be very profound, and he influences everyones lives. Again, I don't think thats deep. Its an obvious mockery, too obvious, in my opinion.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to a graphic sex scene, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1498435200,2,2288,4.823979591836735

Sometimes I think that a good drama does not need multiple story arcs or fancy effects to resonate with audiences.  This film shows the truth of that powerfully, while leaving it up to us (the viewers) to create meaning from what we have seen.  The hold of the mass media over our collective imaginations has never been presented in quite such a funny way, with the possible exception of Paddy Chayefsky's Network.",1494806400,4,628,4.831775700934579

347137,5,6301590740,"""Being There""(1979) is probably the perfect film to close out the decade of the Seventies, a decade that seemed to pale in comparison to the previous one. To be sure, it did bring an end to the Vietnam War and even marked the first time a sitting President resigned from office but the socio-political values and the effect of the media on society are still with us in 2017. Based on the novel by Jerzy Kosinski, ""Being There"" is an outrageous fable of the political, religious and consumer society in which we live seen through the eyes of a simple minded and childlike gardener named Chance. Criterion has now brought ""Being There"" to Blu-ray and the results are once again outstanding. According to the liner notes from the enclosed booklet: ""This new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution from the 35 mm original camera negative and color graded under the supervision of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed"". The result is a pristine picture from start to finish(Bitrate: 28.00) which should more than please fans of the film. Directed by Hal Ashby, the majority of the film takes place in the Washington DC mansion of wealthy industrialist Benjamin Rand(Oscar winner Melvyn Douglas) and this is where the cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is really highlighted. Filmed inside the enormous Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina(substituting for Washington DC), both interiors and exteriors are a wonder to behold on Blu-ray. Viewers will actually feel like they're inside the mansion watching all the action take place whether it's in the two-story book lined library, the carved wood paneled interior of the elevator or the flowered gardens and greenhouse of the mansions exteriors. Close-ups are another delight (you can easily see Shirley MacLaine's freckles underneath her make-up) as are costumes, automobiles, books, and the many Seventies television sets used throughout the film. The acting is top notch with Peter Sellers giving a career capping performance as childlike Chance,  gardener who has an unusual effect on those around him. Sellers totally inhabits the role in a remarkable performance that will stay with you long after the film ends(sadly, Sellers died shortly after the films release). Shirley MacLaine. Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden are excellent in their supporting roles. The Audio(LPCM Mono 1.0) is crystal clear. Again from the liner notes: ""The monaural soundtrack was remastered from the 35 mm original magnetic track. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum, and crackle were manually removed"" and this makes for a pleasing listening experience. ""Being There"" is 130 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.85:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include: (1) Promo reel with Sellers and Ashby(3 min.); (2) a ""making of"" documentary(48 min.); (3) Hal Ashby at the AFI(audio only-33 min.); (4) A 1979 appearance on the Dick Cavett Show by Jerzy Kosinski (20 min.); (5) Peter Sellers on two TV talk shows from 1980(11 min.); (6) Deleted scenes and outtakes(10 min.); (7) Trailer and TV spots(3 min.). There is an informative booklet by writer Mark Harris enclosed with the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in Criterion's standard clear Blu-ray case. ""Being There"" is a remarkable fable that has lost none of it's meaning in the nearly forty years since it's release and comes very highly recommended.",1491091200,10,3457,5.251356238698011

realize that this film is highly regarded for various reasons, but it
was a total misfire for me.

The film is a one-joke work that wears thin very quickly. Just as
quickly, it becomes less and less credible. It becomes not so much a
matter of how obtuse the Sellers character is, but how totally
credulous and unbelievable the rest of the characters are. Not for one
minute did I believe any of their reactions to Sellers beyond the first
few encounters.

It's too bad, really, because Sellers was an amazing talent; a totally
plastic actor who could literally become any of the characters he
played. I will continue to enjoy most of his other work, but I could
never sit through this again. It was boring and, after a while,
excruciating.  The two stars are for Sellers alone.",1472860800,,845,4.438709677419355

347319,4,6301590740,"This was a difficult film to watch at first. Peter Sellers was a tremendous talent and the world has lost him too early. If he had lived longer, he would have become knighted and awarded with an Academy Award as Best Actor. His performance is quite, subtle and humble unlike his Inspector Clouseau character. He plays Chance the Gardener who leaves the only home he has ever known into Washington D.C. where he becomes involved with the powerful Rand family, political insiders, who socialize with the President of the United States.

For two hours, this film is a quiet powerhouse with Melvyn Douglas in his Academy Award winning performance as Mr. Rand. Shirley MacLaine plays his wife, Eve Rand. She is barely recognizable in her role. The supporting cast is stellar with performances by James Noble, Jack Warden, Richard Dysart, Alice Hirson, Richard Basehart, and more.

Based on Jerry Kosinski's novel, Chance is an uneducated gardener who has spent his entire life in one home. When he ventures out into the world after his employer passes on, he is totally clueless and innocent at first. Peter Sellers delivered a performance of a lifetime in this role. The screen credits at the final film displayed his sense of humor.

The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer and a list of awards won by the film itself. Melvyn Douglas was one of the first actors to join the Screen Actors Guild too. His Academy Award was long overdue.",1468713600,,1431,4.808943089430894

347379,5,6301590740,"BEING THERE is at one level a period-piece, an evocation of a period in American history when Washington DC was a far more dangerous and drug-ridden city than it is today, and where television (in the pre-cable era) was dominated by quiz-shows and raucous advertisements. The characters' long hair and double-breasted suits also attest to an era that to modern viewers might be seen to lack style.

Yet despite the settings, the basic thrust of Hal Ashby's classic comedy remains as significant today as it did nearly forty years ago. Chance the gardener (Peter Sellers) is very much the innocent abroad; the servant forcibly removed from his childhood home trying to make his way in a hostile world. It is his good fortune that he should fetch up at Eve Rand's (Shirley MacLaine's) mansion, and be offered a new home as a result. Sellers gives possibly his best characterization on film as the television-fixated gardener whose expression remains largely impassive yet oddly charming. Chance accepts everyone on their own terms; class and status do not matter. He addresses the President of the United States (Jack Warden) as ""Bob,"" being completely unaware of expected formal conventions. All he knows about is tending gardens, and he preaches that message with an enthusiasm and an ingenuousness that contrast with the more worldly speech-patterns of the other characters.

The film offers director Ashby the chance to lampoon politicians and media buffs, all of whom willfully misinterpret Chance's words and regard him as something of a guru rather than a lowly gardener. There are strong echoes of other comedies such as Moliere's TARTUFFE in the way the chat-show host Gary Burns (Jerome Hellman) listens intently to Chance as if he were a great politician. The only difference, of course, is that whereas Tartuffe merely pretended to be a guru as a way of exploiting his social superiors, Chance is a true innocent.

The ending is both poignant and unexpected, as Chance is seen, quite literally, to walk on water. He might not be very clever as his one-time protector Louise (Ruth Attaway) remarks, but his determination to enjoy the moment offers an example to us all.

Director Hal Ashby fashions a brilliant film out of Jerzy Kosinski's novel. There is very little music to distract the viewers' attention, and Caleb Deschanel's lush photography captures the olde-worlde quality of the Rands' mansion. The director uses several establishing-shots to denote the world in which Chance operates; and is not frightened of using long takes focusing on the characters' relationship to their environment.

BEING THERE is a modern classic; it is sad that the film won only won Oscar, and the fact that Sellers was deprived of a Best Actor award (by Dustin Hoffman in the mawkish KRAMER VS. KRAMER) demonstrates how myopic the American Academy of Arts and Sciences actually were.",1462147200,,2882,5.071729957805907

This was his final performance. And he should have got an Oscar. Again denied. It is a political satire that is particularly relevant given politics in America today.

In this stimulating comic allegory, Peter Sellers plays Chance who is brilliant as a slow-witted, innocent gardener who becomes destitute when his employer dies, as a former house cleaner of his said that that boy had rice budding between his ears and was short-changed by God. The gardener's only understanding of the world comes from watching television, for he had never been allowed to leave his home. As the narrative proceeds, the audience are shown that through an odd series of circumstances, Sellers ends up being a close personal advisor to the President of the United States (Jack Warden). His naive pronouncements are professed as reflective insights, to such a degree that he is seriously considered as a Presidential contender.

--------""Life is a state of mind""---------- (One of the pronouncements from the film) -----------

Sellers made this film, a timeless comedy - but wittier than most of the comedy we see in film today. This performance is second, to maybe his role in Lolita and in the Pink Panther series, Sellers is not only funny, Sellers turns in one of his most skilled performances ever, in what would also be one of his last before his sudden death.

Not matter how small your movie tastes are; this is a film that is really worth seeing.

347534,5,6301590740,"In this stimulating comic allegory, Peter Sellers plays Chance who is brilliant as a slow-witted, innocent gardener who becomes destitute when his employer dies, as a former house cleaner of his said that that boy had rice budding between his ears and was short-changed by God. The gardener's only understanding of the world comes from watching television, for he had never been allowed to leave his home. As the narrative proceeds, the audience are shown that through an odd series of circumstances, Sellers ends up being a close personal advisor to the President of the United States (Jack Warden). His Nave pronouncements are professed as reflective insights, to such a degree that he is seriously considered as a Presidential contender.

--------""Life is a state of mind""---------- (One of the pronouncements from the film) ------------

Sellers made this film, a timeless comedy - but wittier than most of the comedy we see in film today. This performance is second, to maybe his role in Lolita and in the Pink Panther series, Sellers is not only funny, Sellers turns in one of his most skilled performances ever, in what would also be one of his last before his sudden death.

347550,5,6301590740,"I had seen glimpses of Peter Sellers talent in Lolita and Dr Strangelove. However, I did not realise what a talent he was until I watched Being There.

 Sellers plays a middle-aged man called Chance. He has lived his whole life in an older mans house, working as a gardener and watching television. When the previous owner of the house dies Chance is made to move out and begins an aimless wander into the outside word.

 From Chance's first interaction with people, he is revealed as not having a personality. He has spent his whole life socialising with a television, and his mind has turned into one. He simply expresses what he hears, with the messages not being mixed with other ideas or reshaped by emotion. He does not have human emotion: emotion blended and shaped by ideas, wants and desires. He has a kind of fear: but it comes across as the fear of a deer in the wild, rather than a human responding to a situation based on past experiences and future plans and desires.

 Being There suggests the idea that a human personality is shaped by socialisation: we are products of our interactions. Chances interactions have been with a television, and he has been shaped through those interactions. In this we hear both echoes of Lockes notion of tabula rasa, and the Hegelian thought that our personalities are the result of our interactions with external beings.

 Being There however is not only about the nature of the human self. As Chance moves into the world, he encounters a range of people that project themselves onto him. He tells Eve (the wife of a wealthy businessman that he gains the favour of) that he is Chance the gardener; from this point on he is known as Chauncey Gardiner  a name one would not be surprised to hear in wealthy circles.

 When he repeats something someone says to him, or something he heard on television, he is viewed as speaking words of wisdom: people take him to be a modern Confucius; a man who expresses great truths through vague statements. Others take him to be espousing economic theory, a tendency towards sexual deviance, or reflections on death.

 Being There is a philosophical masterpiece but is also comedy. There is something hilarious about the seriousness of the people that project their agendas onto Chance. It is not incidental that the things taken by Chance to be statements of wisdom are taken straight from television or from the mouths of others. The movie is making fun of what humans take to be wisdom: of how we hear ideas and repeat them without truly reflecting on them. This perfect blend of comedy and deep insight is encapsulated by the music to that plays when Chance enters the world: a jazz/funk arrangement over Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss.

 Sellers plays this role perfectly. Throughout the whole movie he never once fails to convince. A personality simply never emerges to make us sense that this is an actual person pretending to be nothing. It is simply astonishing that Sellers failed to win an Oscar for this performance: who really takes the Academy Awards seriously anyway?

 Hal Ashby, the director of Being There, is not well known in 2015. In researching Being There I discovered that shortly after making this movie Ashby entered a downward spiral of drugs and unreliability, and never made another well-regarded movie. The movies Ashby made before Being There are also nowhere near its greatness. We are left to speculate whether Ashby had only one great idea, or whether the world was deprived of more masterpieces due to a premature decline.

347561,5,6301590740,"""Life is a state of mind.""

Peter Sellers lobbied for years to get the lead in ""Being There.""  From the late sixties to the mid seventies, his career had stalled, resuscitated only by the revival of the ""Pink Panther"" series.  When he finally landed the part in ""Being There,"" he hoped it would be his lasting contribution to cinema after years of playing lightweight roles.  He was right.  With all due respect to Clouseau fans, of which I am one, along with his roles in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" his portrayal of Chance the gardener in ""Being There"" was probably the best thing he ever did.  It's a pleasure to welcome this film back in a pair of 30th Anniversary editions, one on DVD and the one reviewed here on Blu-ray.

Never underestimate the power of good fortune.  Mark Twain understood the principle when he penned the short story ""Luck"" over a hundred years ago, as did Nathaniel Hawthorne in ""Feathertop"" before that.  In both stories, people judge others not by their accomplishments but by their appearance and by their being in the right place at the right time.  With Twain a military general rises to his position by blundering into victories; with Hawthorne a witch brings an empty-headed scarecrow to life as a handsome, well-attired young man, whom people mistake for a person of wealth and position.  Which brings us to ""Being There,"" the 1979 comic fable by Jerzy Kosinski, directed by Hal Ashby (""Harold and Maude,"" ""The Last Detail,"" ""Shampoo,"" ""Coming Home""), with music by Johnny Mandel.  Like the movie's famous predecessors, it follows the exploits of a man of humble means mistaken for one of enormous authority.  The film's subtitle in the promos was ""A Story of Chance,"" and so it is.  Would that we were all so lucky.

""Being There"" has for many years been special to me personally.  For one thing, it's a serious comedy classic that enormously impressed me the first time I saw it in a theater and one that continues to impress me today.  For another, it was the last great film Peter Sellers made after giving us a lifetime of notable accomplishments like ""The Ladykillers,"" ""The Mouse That Roared,"" ""Lolita,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and, of course, the ""Pink Panther"" movies.  It's a shame he had to end his career with the appalling ""Fu Manchu"" debacle, but ""Being There,"" his second-to-last film, more than compensates.  And for yet another thing, ""Being There"" was the first prerecorded videotape I ever owned, a gift from the Wife-O-Meter, along with a brand-spanking new Sony Betamax, circa 1981.

Sellers stars as a simpleminded gardener named (what else?) Chance, an idiot savant of gardening, a little boy in an adult body.  He has worked in the same house in Washington, D.C., for the same man his entire life, never leaving the confines of the home's walls or gardens.  He has no relatives and no background beyond his existence as a gardener, the only thing he ever remembers doing.  He is middle aged, distinguished in appearance, always elegantly dressed in his master's best suits.  Being a simpleton, Chance is devoid of much understanding of the goings on around him, and devoid of much feeling, too.  Above all, he enjoys watching television.  In his tiny filament of a brain, TV is his only reality, yet he is wholly indiscriminate in what he watches.  He is unable to do so much as read or write.

Imagine his dilemma when the old man dies, leaving him penniless, alone, and virtually helpless in the world for the first time in his life, with no one to look after him and nowhere to go.  Lawyers for the old man's estate throw him out on his ear.  Dressed in his finest clothes, Chance wanders the streets of Washington aimlessly for a while until, as luck would have it, he gets lightly bumped by a car.  Not just any car.  A limousine belonging to Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), the wife of the richest and most powerful man in the country, Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas, winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor Oscar in the role).  Eve insists that Chance come home with her and let the Rands' personal physician (Richard Dysart) tend to his injury.  Mystified by it all, Chance does so.  When she asks him his name, he tries to mutter ""Chance, the gardener,"" but it comes out sounding like ""Chauncey Gardener.""  And so begins one of the shrewdest, funniest, and most touching sociopolitical satires in movie history.

From this point in the story, everything Chance does or says people misinterpret to mean something else.  He unintentionally ingratiates himself to the Rands, who find him refreshingly honest and invite him to stay in their fabulous mansion indefinitely.  No one questions him but takes him at face value.  Chance looks good.  His bewildered silence people repeatedly mistake for quiet intellect, and they think his idiotic smiles are nods of knowing approval.  People put words in his mouth, and they think he has a wonderful sense of humor when he asks inane questions like why the elevator is such a small room and whether it has a television.  Before long, Rand invites Chance to meet the President of the United States (Jack Warden), where everyone misconstrues Chance's advice about gardening as learned metaphoric wisdom about the state of the country's economy.  He becomes the talk of the town and the intimate of the high and mighty, even appearing on TV talk shows where he becomes a media icon, and the entire nation comes to love his unadorned philosophy.

Sellers puts in what may be the most effectively understated performance he ever committed to the screen.  He never raises or lowers his voice beyond a monotone (Sellers said he patterned his voice inflections after Stan Laurel), he never makes a gesture of hand, face, or body beyond the slightest increment of movement, yet he conveys a world of meaning with every nuance.  He is able to make all of those around him draw their own conclusions about him, and in the film they are all wrong.  The Russian ambassador (Richard Basehart) thinks him brilliant, at an embassy party the rumor floats that he speaks eight languages, the CIA and FBI can find no trace of him in their files, leading them to believe that he must have enormously influential connections, and Eve falls in love with him.  ""He's such a kind and sensitive man.""

""Being There"" is a film that begins slowly and becomes funnier by the minute as it gets ever more absurd.  By the end, to the people around him, Chance can walk on water.

Trivia:  The Academy nominated Sellers for an Oscar for Best Actor, which some people said he lost because of the outtakes shown during the closing credits.  Sellers thought they spoiled the tone of the movie.  I agree.

Video:
The image quality in this newly remastered Blu-ray edition looks clean and clear after three decades, with no obvious age marks, scratches, fades, or lines.  Warner Bros. went out of their way to capture the 1.85:1-ratio picture as well as possible, using a VC-1 encode and a dual-layer BD50.  However, the image remains fairly soft and pale most of the time.  Director Ashby appears to have shot many if not most of the indoor scenes using natural light, or he tried to emulate natural light, which doesn't provide a very bright or vivid image.  Nor has the picture the sharpest delineation, with colors sometimes on the dim and dusky side.  When Ashby is shooting outdoors, the colors and definition come into their own.  Therefore, the disc's video quality is basically true to life, yet it is not such that will impress many fans of high-definition Blu-ray.

Audio:
We get the English audio track in both Dolby TrueHD 1.0 and Dolby Digital monaural, neither of which is anything special.  The TrueHD adds a slight degree of clarity and weight to the sound, but it does little for the dynamics or frequency extremes.  Still, the all-important midrange is smooth, rich, and truthful, and for a dialogue-driven story such as this one, that's all that really matters.

Extras:
The 30th Anniversary Blu-ray and DVD releases contain a small but notable collection of extras.  First among them is a 2008 featurette, ""Memories from Being There,"" a fifteen-minute set of reminiscences with filmmaker and actress Illeana Douglas, the granddaughter of the film's co-star, Melvyn Douglas.  After that are two recently discovered scenes, totaling around two minutes, followed by a two-minute alternate ending that is far less memorable than the one the director chose to use, and then a six-minute gag reel.

The extras conclude with a generous thirty-six scene selections but no bookmarks; a full-screen theatrical trailer; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
""Being There"" is not a comedy that will thrill everyone; it isn't deep, dark, or sidesplitting, just placid and poignant.  The movie's satire is perhaps more topical today than ever, and it remains a gentle reminder of Man's eternal gullibility, our susceptibility to be taken in by appearances.  We believe what we want to believe.  We make people into what we want them to be.  The movie ends in one of the most remarkable scenes in cinema.  There is apparently nothing Chance is incapable of doing.",1432944000,2,9239,4.863723608445298

The lines are so simple but yet profound. This film shows the absurdity of television and how it influences our society profoundly, without us even knowing it. That's what is so brilliant in this film, as the actors are soooo obtuse they have no clue as to the mentality of their ""celebrity,"" Mr. Gardner, whose every action is taken from what he has seen on T.V.
Everyone in the film thinks ""Chauncy"" has totally hung the moon and they take each word he says and apply it to their own life even though what he says is nonsense. Yet, his simple life is profound also, as he is not distracted by modern society (telephones, newspapers, etc.) but what he sees on television.

347610,4,6301590740,"I am torn.  The film is one of my favorites, until the surprise ending, then it baffles.  As a young man I saw this film when it played in theaters, and I loved it.  A great satire of the mind-numbing effects of television and our quick fix culture, and the ending just added to the mystery of the Peter Sellers character, Chance the Gardner.  But after viewing it recently, in middle age, I had the sinking feeling that the ending was inappropriate, that it didn't fit the rest of the film.  So I had to view it again with the ending in mind and I was only confirmed in this feeling.  Was Hal Ashby telling us that Chance could make you ""think"" that he could walk on water?  Could he in fact walk on water?  But as I listened to the eulogy for the Rand character, all meaningless bromides, I couldn't help but think that Chance, indeed, was a character that simply made people see what they wanted to see of themselves in him.  For that, he was the perfect candidate for the corporate masters who wanted to control the country (the pallbearers at the end of the film).  Why have him walk on water?  That said, the film is a wonderful satire of our desire-driven culture, cleverly shot with scenes that frame the action as if it was on a television, and Peter Sellers' performance is stunning, absolutely stunning.  I just wish Hal Ashby was alive to explain the ending.",1426032000,,1370,4.414342629482071

347639,5,6301590740,"The film makes the point that we rarely relate to each other as we really are - we see in others what we want to see.  Chance the gardener, as a well-dressed man wandering around Washington, DC, is mistaken for a businessman with the very proper name ""Chauncey Gardiner,"" and his simple statements about gardening are interpreted as profound metaphors of the meaning of life and how to run a productive society.  As for himself, Chance no more understands the people around him than they understand him, despite his sincerely repeated ""I understand.""  It's necessary to ignore the implausibility of Chance never being found out - maybe people will buy his ""in winter, the garden sleeps"" pronouncements, but eventually, someone is going to ask him where he ""summered,"" if he's a Harvard or Yale man, or his favorite brand of scotch, and while he may be able to fool everyone on TV, he still has to be able to make chit-chat at the country club.  Appearance is everything - the scene where the maid, Louise, sees Chance on television and remarks ""it's a white man's world in America"" makes the difference clear - Chance would not be where he is if he had been a black man, dressed in overalls like a real gardener.

The ending is a dig at the GOP smoke-filled back-room establishment types who historically have decided that party's nominee; Dan Quayle and George W. Bush come to mind as Chance-like figures.  And the last scene, in which Chance walks out onto the lake with no visible means of support, like the rest of the film, means whatever the viewer wishes to make of it.  Is Chance a god, to whom the laws of nature don't apply?  Is he continuing to fool everyone, even himself, by walking on a submerged pier that no one knew was there?  Or, since this is his first encounter with a body of water, is he simply too stupid to realize that he's supposed to sink?  Wisely, the film leaves the question of Chance's fate open.",1422144000,,1928,4.578488372093023

I stayed there a little longer.  Then I stayed a little longer and then the ending came along.  I was struck by the magnetic effect that this show (and some others in the past) had on my mind.

I didn't know what the beginning was like though.  When it came along the next time on TV I also missed the beginning.  I finally caught the beginning of the show on TV sometime in the future and I was captivated by the entire show.

347649,5,6301590740,"Do not judge a movie by the first few minutes. If you did that with this movie, you would have missed a great movie.

Yes, it started slow, but once people started listening to our main character (Peter Sellers) and misunderstanding him (thinking he is talking more deeply than he really is), it gets hilarious. It gets better and has a surprise ending (at least it was a surprise to me),

What made this an even more memorable movie for me? The many examples of things that the main character said. I could understand where he was coming from (I have ADHD and Asperger's, which might make it easier for me to empathize), but I could also understand how the people around him got completely different meanings from what he said. His responses are totally innocent, yet how he gets misunderstood is just fantastic.

This is a strange movie. It starts out slow, and I was lost for awhile. I was feeling sorry for Peter Seller's character, Chance, because he was being forced out of the only home he ever knew. I practically yelled at the screen that his years of steady occupancy should count for something.

Anyway, chance encounters between Chance and other people help the movie move along. The ending of the movie was a total surprise to me, and reflected on the innocence of the charaacter..

This is a wonderful little movie. And the little ""extra"" feature looking at the memories that are related to us by the granddaughter of one of the other actors gave me some extra pleasure. I understand it is based on a book. I will have to put that book on my ""read list"" someday.

John",1421539200,,1582,4.552816901408451
347650,5,6301590740,"If your reading this review, then you have probably already seen Being There.  The four and five star reviews on Amazon on this wonderful movie are all spot on. The great script, deliberate pacing, direction, cinematography, music and excellent acting by entire cast, especially Peter Sellers, are all simply outstanding. For its entire running length, Being There successfully holds a delicate combination of two moods, humor and sadness.  The film easily rates four to five stars.

My problem is with the Blu Ray. I have both the original DVD of the film (circa 2000) and I now have the brand new Blue Ray as well. By far the Blu Ray has the more perfect and attractive picture, strong contrast, vibrant colors and non-existent grain and artifacts.  It simply outshines the DVD in all respects. That said the old DVD version is better. The problem is that the Blu Ray version of the movie no longer looks like the film's original and personalized photography. Being There's photography is now indistinguishable from any other current Hollywood movie and the deliberately soft and slightly muted, autumn-like colors no longer has any connection to the mood of the film.

Top Hollywood cinematographers knew exactly what they were doing and most were very good at matching the directors intention. Now we have young people moving a PC-mouse and messing around with colors, tints, brightness and contrast.  They are playing with the entire mood of the film.  The look of the photography in Being There on the Blu Ray now pops off the screen to the point of distraction.  I saw Being There in the theater and I recall that the original photography was soft and subtle and never drew attention to itself, much like story and the characters.  This is the way it looks on the old DVD. On the Blu Ray, now every car driving on DC's dirty Pennsylvania Ave in the winter shine like they were just waxed and detailed.  White shirts, bed sheets, handkerchiefs are now way up front and jump off the screen where they should remain unnoticed in the background.  The viewer should be focused only on Chance while he is walking through the forest at the end of the film, not being distracted by the now stunning white snow.

I noticed a similar problem with Criterion's Blu Ray restoration of A Hard Days Night.  Originally, A Hard Days Night's photography gave the impression of watching an old black and white news real on TV.  Now the digital nerds have turned A Hard Days Night into a beautiful looking, ultra clear, ultra sharp piece of black and white eye-candy, as if it was made yesterday on the finest film and with the newest cameras. The original Blu Ray restoration changed the look of the photography, where it no longer fits the TV-documentary-like feel of the time period.

It's one thing to restore the tattered, torn, speckled and worn out prints to their original look. It is another to erase the character of the cinematography by ""beautifying"" the film with digital shenanigans.  This is what has taken place on the Blu Ray restoration of Being There.",1421452800,47,3057,4.7942857142857145

347671,5,6301590740,"Peter Sellers had a stellar film career but this was a unique outing for him.  This is listed as a comedy but it was as much an existential look at society and power as a comedy.  It truly was as if the Twilight Zone had a comedy episode...it is that strange and that well-written.
The story has Peter Sellers as a clueless boarder who's forced out of a posh estate home and thrust into the no-holds-barred world of the Washington elite.  He's constantly amazed at the slightest thing...though he's impeccably dressed and speaks with perfect elocution, he's apparently utterly clueless.  Instead of this being an impediment, somehow he's construed as being brilliant and is promoted socially until he's a clueless power broker.
With brilliant acting by Shirley Maclaine and Melvyn Douglas(as the wealthy wife and husband that take him in as house guest), the script just weaves an incredible tale of blind luck and being in the right place at the right time(i.e. 'being there').

It's a bit long by today's standards.  The main character, who is evicted when his benefactor dies and has no way to prove he has the right to continue to live there, is unbelievably lucky and ultimately triumphs over those who don't respect him.  He becomes very famous and successful because of inane statements he makes that are misinterpreted by others - very cleverly done dialogues. The movie champions and rewards simplicity and goodness of character.

I will admit to a preconceived notion of Seller's over the top routines in previous films. I was truly taken aback with this supremely subdued performance and taken in with hopes of a new and exciting hidden talent. But alas, Qualludes ruled the day, scene after scene. The TV programs shown provided highlights to recall the ""Best Of"" Mister Rogers, my favorite and most appropriate.

Hence, drivel driven dialogue prompted me to look elsewhere for entertainment and found the Shirley scene most enlivening. I thought her wild antics in ""Terms of Endearment"" would be the zenith of her seXy endeavors but here er, lies her consummate performance. Bravo! She was most beautiful and believable in her attempts to deliver a distraction for dear ol' Chance.

Political figures perennially provide fodder for mindless creature exposition, but this vehicle exudes an inordinate sorrow for such a career path. Ashby is to be commended for utilizing reverse psychology with nary a hint at this fait accompli.

Having lived in the Washington D.C. area for many years and enjoying a diplomatic license plate immunity made for remarkable memories. What a beautiful city, notably apres sunset.

347833,5,6301590740,"Am still reeling from just watching this tautly-drolle film, can't articulate a proper review;  will edit later.  Surely someone was thinking of Oscar Wilde's classic, when shooting it.  Same appearance versus real identity issues, same romantic comic result (but for a whole nation of people, not merely a few), plus much more.  BRAVO.

How all the cast members, especially Peter Sellers, managed to stay deadpan enough to make this film, is a wonder to me.  If you want to know what is wrong with the human race, as well as what is endearing about it, watch this film.  It's as true today as back in 1979 when the film was made.

The other reviewers covered the specifics of plot and ethos.  For me, this is a tour de force answering the question, 'why don't we humans GET IT, by now?'  This, and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are my two favorite movie satires, right up there with Ruling Class.  Save yourself time and money reading 'the philosophers', who frankly are the same folk who'd hawk 'Chauncey' here in the movie.  Just watch the movie.

347923,5,6301590740,"""Being There"" transports one into another world--which is what movies are supposed to do--and is beautifully crafted in every aspect possible.  The movie came out when I was a teenager, and I never fully appreciated it until now.  I'm sure there are teenagers who might enjoy it on certain levels, but middle age brings out the subtleties in things I missed as a young girl.

Because the plot about the intertwined lives of a few individuals is unique in the annals of filmmaking, I won't repeat the story here, except to say it is funny, sad, warm, gentle, sharp and utterly brilliant.  Peter Sellers turns in the best performance of his life.  The screenplay was adapted by Jerzy Kosiski, who wrote the original novel, and so I am persuaded that he successfully created the vision for which he strived.  There isn't a single wasted moment or misplaced image in the entire picture.  Visually, it is a treat; philosophically and otherwise, it will make you think.  This is, in my opinion, an example of cinematic perfection.

So--I highly recommend ""Being There.""  I find that it's best viewed late at night, when things are quiet.  See it with someone you love.",1401580800,11,1162,4.788944723618091

347983,5,6301590740,"This movie has been analyzed to death so I'll throw in my 2 cents worth. As someone once said ""you don't need to know anything to have an opinion"". Like John Wayne in ""The Shootist "" I feel Peter Sellers somehow knew this was to be his final film even if only subconsciously. Now, the final scene where Peter walks on water. I am of two minds about this. First, Peter is a godlike being having a giant cosmic joke on everyone, enjoying immensely the mortals reading profound meaning into his inane pronouncements about gardening. Thus the slight smile after he pushes his umbrella into the water to show he really is walking on water.
Second, he really is as stupid as his black house keeper says. Ergo he can walk on water because he's too stupid to know he can't do it.

As Yoda told Luke ""Don't try - Do or Do Not, that is why you fail. He was commenting on the total belief and commitment you need to do a seemingly impossible task. If only it was this easy for most of us to shed the mental garbage that holds us back from becoming what we could be.

Of all sad words of tongue and pen - the saddest of these ""It might have been"".

This movie is a wonderful comment on how perception of reality is clouded by ones preconceived notions of what reality is. If Aliens landed in Central Park before the military could clamp down on the media boy I'd like to see that. Maybe, because there's always a BUT !!!

Every time a comedic genius dies the world looses another light. Hopefully another is born at the same time.

The wonderful jazz piece playing as Chance walks into the world for the first time is:

Also Sprach Zarathustra  by Eumir Deodato,  a jazz rendition of the Strauss song. Many will recognize it from the movie 2001.",1397088000,3,1733,4.343653250773994

348041,1,6301590740,"Based on the Jerzy Kosinski novel, it is the story of Chance, a middle-aged simpleton who has lived all his life inside a mansion, watching television programs at random when he isn't gardening.  The owner dies, but Chance is incapable of truly caring about the fact.  He is forced to leave the house, along with a black woman who was the other servant.  The neighborhood around him has turned into a slum, and he wanders around until a car owned by a wealthy man hits him, and he is taken to the house of a dying millionaire and his wife.  He is mistaken for somebody intellectual when he spouts random gardening-related phrases, and people are impressed.

The idea of an idiot taken for a genius is a good basis for a comedy or satire.  But the trouble is, Chance is not only without brains, he has absolutely no feelings as well.  What's funny about that?  And people who have gotten who they are through guile and ambition can certainly be fooled, especially through their own wishful thinking.  But a con can go on for only so long before people get suspicious, and it seems that nobody does.  Perhaps if these people knew he was a simpleton and used him as a front man, the idea might have worked.  But the movie's joke goes on for far too long and ultimately has no ending.",1393718400,4,1280,4.450643776824034

He is surrounded by people who think his introspection is a sign that he's a genius and has all the right answers to solve the world's problems.

348181,5,6301590740,"This is a very well-done movie of a very funny, very disturbing, very chilling book by a very disturbed author.

Peter Sellers plays Chance, who, while still young enough to have no earlier memories, ended up in the house of a very rich, powerful man in Washington, D.C. where nobody paid him much attention and, like Topsy, he just growed.

The movie opens with him watching a TV as some other somber, well-dressed people come in and explain that they are lawyers and that he must pack his belongings and leave.

Wearing his benefactor's clothes (the 1920's wardrobe of ""a man of parts,"" now come round to be fashionable again) he steps through the gate in the estate's garden wall and steps into the Hieronymus Bosch hell of late 20th Century Washington, D.C.

His first experience is with an encounter with some street punks who try to shake him down. He has seen this before on the only place he has seen anything: TV. He resorts to the only keepsake he was allowed to bring out of the old man's house: the TV remote control. He doesn't like the gang confronting him so he knows how to make them go away. He points the remote at them and presses a button.

There are computer programs which start out ""knowing"" nothing. They learn by watching you. They learn the goal and the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe by watching what their opponent does. Thus does Chance learn.

He ends up a guest at the house of a Washington heavy-weight and, like the computer program, copies the actions of the people around him without having the slightest idea of what he is doing or saying.

The last scene has a troop of Washington insiders planning to run him for President.",1386633600,,1651,4.5574324324324325

Few of us ever grasp that something that thin is stronger than gigantic steel cables and nanotube strands. It brushes by billions of lost souls who have been looking for something stronger to save them; power, money, status, deceit, megalomania. They have yet to learn how it helps  to see and understand the world that rolls over them. It's always been a garden of serenity where you can sit and think. If you can sit still long enough in any place, it becomes a garden where you slow things down and see how they grow; how they adapt, how they move one way or another, to avoid obstacles and find those natural paths of least resistance. It's always a journey of growth to wisdom. If you drive 65 MPH on a highway over a period of time, most of it is always a blurred place you zoom through. When there is construction up ahead or an accident that slows your life down,  the invisible tube you had flown through, suddenly has a new universe of natural green detail. Find a quiet place where you watch the world around you and you will be fertilized by natural movement. Nature has Life lessons for everyone.

348342,5,6301590740,"If you like comedy that runs a few degrees out from the plane of reality, this may be a great movie for you. Surreal is an apt term.

Being there depends on one basic joke that makes the whole movie and makes it wonderful. Chauncey sees the word in his simple way and almost everyone he meets thinks there is some deeper meaning to the simple way he looks at the world. His innocent simplicity makes you want to like him.

How the powerful Chancy meets read deeper meanings from him and assume he is a person of power is the basis of the whole movie. I can only imagine Peter Sellers playing this role so perfectly. A superb supporting cast including Shirley Maclaine, Jack Warden and Melvyn Douglas provide the framework for Seller's great performance.

I wish this had been the crowning last glory of the great Peter Sellers. I would have been a fitting finish to a great career.

Being there is a masterpiece of how people believe what they want - isn't that so much like politics today? It makes the premise and theme of this movie as pertinent today as when it was first released in theatres decades ago.

It wasn't exactly the type of movie that a teenager would sit through but somehow, it slowly engrossed my interest and absorbed me into the story and the characters.  It was a perfect mix between comediec, dramatic, ironic, humorous, because the audience was meant to get it, while the characters skillfully portrayed how oblivious and yet as charismatically drawn to Sellers as the audience in the theater.

I walked out of the theater knowing i had just seen a true masterpiece as it left me wondering endlessly about the film and the character of Sellers for years to come.  I have seen the movie once as an adult, and again just recently on Amazon, and again I was totally immersed in the characters and genius of the story and Sellers character.

In 1979 I walked out of the theater not quite understanding everything I saw, but it touched me, the ending espeecially left me in wonder about what it meant, and it was just that ending that etched this film into my mind for years to come.

This was a movie that was rich in depth, and remains probably the best film I have ever seen, as it has evoked the same wonder and awe today as it did when I saw it as a teen in the theater.  I am now almost Seller's age at the time he made this film, and it one of the only films, if not the only film, that I remember with wonder, intrigue, love, curiousity and wonder. And that is where the genius of this film lies, is so thought provoking.

33 years after my first viewing, I wishI could count the number of times I thought about this film, how mysterious, and beautiful this film was and still remains, to leave such a lasting effect in my consciousness.  Those who can appreciate fine art, this film will leave an impression that will last through the ages.

Much of the film focuses on his quirky episodes to dealing with the real world as much of the enclosure he experienced in the early years still encompasses him like a shadow (going on a talk show, speaking to the President). Strange indeed with memorable scenes involving him walking down a black neighbourhood in D.C. using street talk, hearing Shirley MacLaine receiving an indirect orgasm (probably too kinky for a PG these days), and watching the Basketball Jones music video and Looney Tunes' cartoons on his favourite little obsession, the television. But even with its highlights, the film suffers through an inconsistent and very naturalistic plot that almost feels like it is going nowhere other than following the warm waves of a radiator.

Interesting and enticing at first but rather dull as a whole. It is unfortunate to claim such a thing about a film like this (often having so much grandeur and recognition from film associations, critics, and the Academy) but Sellers is best when doing a rather witty caricature. This is all too much like a drama than a comedy if that is how someone puts it and the political subtext behind the film feels incidental or momentary and not worthy of being listed as a ""political satire"" on some people's lists. Hopefully, someone might see different.""",1371081600,2,1666,5.054545454545455

348703,4,6301590740,"""Being There"" is a very enjoyable movie.  There are insights into politics, social status, human nature, and handicaps/disabilities.

Chance the gardener, a simple-minded soul, works for a wealthy old man.  The old man dies, and Chance is left to fend for himself.  As he leaves the mansion where he's spent his entire life, he meets by chance a wealthy businessman and his wife.  They mistake his simple talk concerning his garden for insightful social and political commentary.  As luck (or chance?) would have it, the  businessman has the ear of the president.  Soon, the simple-minded Chance is hobnobbing with the elites, completely out of his element, but faring remarkably well, because people seem incapable of taking his simple-mindedness for what it really is, instead projecting their own thoughts and aspirations on Chance.

One thing Sellers does extremely well is to portray the world of the mentally handicapped.  Chance's particular problem is never spelled out in the movie, but to me, it seems a remarkable portrayal of mild autism.  You can see the growth in the character from the death of his first benefactor, over which he doesn't shed a tear and seems not to understand, to the old businessman, where we see a tear running down his face.

One word of caution, though:  Don't expect a laugh-out-loud movie.  This is very different from Sellers' Pink Panther movies.  It's more subtle satire than it is slapstick comedy.  And there are times -- especially when Chance is watching TV -- that the story slows down to a crawl.

The movie is a few decades old and we are more cynical today than when it was released. The subtle point the movie seems to make is that we believe what we want to believe and not necessarily what is true. I did not find the premise engaging enough.

Much is made of Sellers acting but what is so difficult about not emoting? Obviously Mr. Sellers is a wonderful actor and I have enjoyed his other work, but this movie was not a favorite.

His comments on the only subject he is able to address intelligently--that of gardening--are mistakenly thought to be metaphors for broader issues ranging from economics to foreign policy.  His chronically misconstrued observations on horticulture soon land him guest spots on television talk shows--appearances that are met with such success that he is eventually selected by the gilded ruling class as their choice for front man and presidential candidate.

348984,5,6301590740,"""Being There"" is a brilliant, brilliant film that gets better every time I view it. I can't say that about the vast majority of movies I see, obviously. Peter Sellers is diabolically good as Chance the gardener, a sheltered nitwit who has spent his entire life in a townhouse, working for an old and presumably once-wealthy man. Upon the man's death, Chance is cast out into the world.

A truly chance encounter then occurs; he is hit by the chauffeur-driven car of a wealthy couple living in the Washington, D.C., area. Just as he's telling the wife his name, he begins coughing because of the alcohol she's served him, and when he says ""Chance the gardener,"" what she hears is ""Chauncey Gardener."" She -- Eve Rand -- takes him home to be cared for by a medical team in the employ of her husband, multimillionaire Ben Rand, who , considerably older than she, is dying.

What ensues is a run-on case of mistaken identity. Chance is just a gardener, but his homespun sayings are taken as wise philosophy by those who insist on seeing meaning and metaphor in everything. Chance is only a gardener, yes, but in the wishful minds of those he meets, he is the mysterious Chauncey Gardener, man of few -- but sage! -- words. Chance really is talking about gardening, but Chauncey becomes a Candide to those who think his voice is the very sound of enlightenment. We must cultivate our garden, indeed!

""Being There"" is a black comedy. Whether you find it funny, along with disturbing, depends in great part on your world view. If you do not suffer fools gladly but enjoy seeing them, now and then, in your books and movies, this flick's for you. If you find it hard to believe that a blithering idiot can't possibly be mistaken for a genius, you need to watch something else -- and, I would submit, pay more attention to the real world around you, in which this sort of thing happens all the time, especially in politics.

349072,5,6301590740,"There is something really special about `Being There'.  It is a sharply written film about the power of just being in the right place at the right time.  It reminded me of `Forrest Gump', just a good movie.  Yes, my loathing of `Forrest Gump' (which I've deemed `well done mediocrity') knows no bounds, but when I see a film like `Being There' is further cements my sentiments because it becomes clear that the idea or premise involving an unsuspecting simpleton making an unexpected difference on the world is a doable and certainly a moving idea that had rich promise.

Peter Sellers, Jerzy Kosinski and Al Ashby pull that promise out and hand it to the audience in spades.

`Being There' tells the story of a gardener named Chance.  Chance has been raised by a wealthy man all his life, tucked away in large home filled with dusty furniture and a bounty of television sets.  Chance has never left the home.  He has tended to the man's garden, clothed himself with the man's clothing (found in the attic) and loved on a schedule of television and prepared meals by the man's maid Louise.  On the film's outset, the old man dies and Chance is left homeless.  He doesn't understand the outside world, but by a stroke of luck he happens to have a run in with Eve, the wife of a wealthy stock broker, and he has found a new home just like that.  His demeanor and his nonsensical rambling about gardening and television is mistaken by men in power as insightful and profound and soon he has made an impact on the entire nation; completely unbeknownst to him.

The ensemble is wonderful.  Peter Sellers completely owns this beautiful performance.  He doesn't resort to gimmicks that loaded down Hanks performance, but instead he finds so much genuineness in Chance.  You can feel the weight of everything completely escaping Chance as he takes it in in the only way he knows how.  Shirley MacLaine is also fantastic here, completely owning Eve in a way that plays off the subtle and injects a ferocity that feels so natural (where was her Oscar nomination?).  I really liked Melvyn Douglas, although his Oscar win was unnecessary (especially when you consider that both MacLaine and Sellers delivered finer turns).

In the end, this film is just beautiful.  The depth of character development is incredible, and the religious allegory that swells in the films finale (talk about a simple trick that makes you reevaluate the entire film) makes for a film that is not only poignant and profound but timely and, well, timeless.",1339977600,2,2520,4.738532110091743
349073,5,6301590740,"I watched this movie originally because I live near the Biltmore Estate where the larger portion of the movie was filmed - mainly to see the landmark in its movie debut. If this had not been the case, I may have missed one of the best dark comedy films of all time!  After the death of the ""Old Man"" Chance is forced to leave the only life he has ever known - a sheltered gardener. After roving thru the streets of Washington DC he is accidentally struck by a limousine carrying a distraught woman named Eve. Eve takes him home to her husband Ben, a important political personality and with an abundance of influential friends and wealth. By doling out common sense he is immediately mistaken for a intellectual genius. Chance the Gardener which is erroneously interpreted as Chauncey Gardiner by his new-found benefactors is a bland gardener with virtually no personality, yet he manages to bungle his way to being one of the most important men in an inner circle of a rich body political. The fact he is clueless to his new-found status adds to the humor and richness of the film. The scene with Shirley MacLaine in the bedroom is top notch - she writhes around the bedroom floor in ecstasy as Chance, once again clueless to the situation, states ""I like to watch"" however, to her detriment, he is talking about the TV and not her sexual escapades. Chance doles out deep advice, which unbeknownst to all involved, pertains to gardening and TV shows but in its genius, cures whatever ails the moment. After tutoring the president in all that is right, Chance wonders away into oblivion literally walking on water.

Peter Sellers is a riot as the deadpan Chance Gardener whose endless pontificating on the welfare of plant-life becomes a potent metaphor for 80's politics, granting him national attention thanks to the endorsement of a dying codger and his concupiscent wife. The film is timeless, save one walking montage early on that seems like it was scored by a malfunctioning machine. The action is primarily contained to a cold, ornate mansion, though it does not seem catastrophic, instead casting a wide sense of exposure due to the fact that most plot points revolve around television and its ability to manipulate the truth--if the truth ever even existed to begin with! Much has been made of the film's final shot with its Christ-like implications. For me, the last few frames make the movie--elevating the proceedings to a level not quite broached by all the network-TV nudging and winking when Chance says things like ""All Is Well In The Garden"" a phrase you might find yourself constantly regurgitating long after the credits have rolled. If you don't mind a slow-boiling storyline and are excited by good old fashioned acting, you will find much to love here. And oh, stick around for a blooper reel (one of the first of its kind) which shows Sellers with his hair down, worth the price of admission alone.",1332979200,,1472,4.987804878048781
349090,5,6301590740,"""Being there"" could be one of the greatest comedies ever produced. When this film was released the misinterpretation of the language used by the protagonist ""Chance the Gardener"" seemed to paralleled the next President's use of language in my opinion. While Ronald Reagan was running for president his language just had to be misinterpreted. During his debate with Jimmy Carter he was asked what he would do to quell the racial tensions in America and Regan confidently said ""In my world there is no racial problem"" & everyone applauded interpreting what was said as that Reagan would create a utopian world free of racial prejudiced. What I believe he was actually saying was -In my world I am sheltered from poverty and I live in world of jelly beans and limousines. This is why I compared the film with Reaganomics. Being there features Peter sellers as a man who repeatedly said ""I like to watch"" which may as well have been ""I don't recall"" which Regan repeatedly said under oath during the Iran Contra Trials. Being There"" seems to parallel how limited use of language can have a misinterpretation in the most ironic consequences. If one views this film one will find only one black actor in this entire film who says ""It's a white mans world"" and she was correct for the time period-1979.

349091,5,6301590740,"Being There (1979)
Drama, Comedy, 130 minutes
Directed by Hal Ashby
Starring Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas

Being There is an unusual movie which is told in an understated way. The events unfold slowly and the viewer is left to reflect on any meaning. Peter Sellers stars as Chance. He tends the garden of an old man and is left homeless when the man dies. The relationship is never explained. Is he the man's son?

The story takes off when Chance leaves the comfort of the only surroundings he has ever known and enters the real world. He is a simple man and apparently doesn't understand the concept of lying. When someone tells him anything, he takes it literally. He suffers a minor injury when a car hits him and the owner, Eve (MacLaine), offers to have him checked out by her doctor.

Although Chance knows nothing of the real world and just talks about his former job as a gardener, others take his words to heart and think that he's using metaphors. It's funny to see how much of an impact his innocent remarks have on the people around him.

Sellers was nominated for his performance and Melvyn Douglas won an Oscar for his portrayal of Eve's dying husband.",1330473600,,1188,4.589622641509434

349094,5,6301590740,"Being There is the most charming movie I've ever seen.  Peter Sellers, as Chauncy Gardener, is at his very best playing a character totally devoid of guile, innocent in the ways of the world, and unself-consciously forthcoming.  Through happenstance, coincidence, and uncontaminated trust he comes to the attention of an aged and infirm man of great wealth who has the political power of a king-maker, ably played by Melvyn Douglas who is a perfect fit for the role.

Before we meet him, Chauncy was a man of unknown provenance who had spent his adult life as the gardener for a rich benefactor whose death leaves him jobless, homeless, and on his own.  Chauncy is a good gardener who knows nothing more than his work and what he has seen watching television.  His lack of experience with the world at large accounts for his ingenuous frankness and winsome good cheer.

It is easy, and probably correct, to construe Chauncy as simple-minded, witless, and slow, but Melvyn Douglas' character and his circle of politically powerful associates see intelligence and wisdom in the calmness and pastoral metaphors that come so easily to a man of the soil.  Soon, absurd though it is, there is talk of promoting Chauncy as a candidate for the presidency.

When Chauncy appears on a national TV talk show, his audience is similarly won over.  His sure-handed rendering of the notion that for everything there is a season is nothing more than a commonsense observation from his years as a gardener, but viewers interpret it as a manifestation of temperate even-handedness and non-ideological good sense.  Chauncy's vagueness does not put off prospective voters, who understand it as reflecting depth and honesty. Yet Chauncy's delivery is really no less abstract and subject to any and all interpretations than the meaningless oratory of contemporary politicians.  Chauncy, however, is speaking of something concrete, his garden, and he seems much more plausible and sincere than those who have no specific referent in mind, but seek only to manipulate prospective voters, a notion that is not part of Chauncy's hopelessly simple worldview.

Melvyn Douglas' wife, played exceptionally well by Shirley Maclaine, falls in love with Chauncy.  As far as love making is concerned, Chauncy, true to his TV-based former life, is limited to watching.  ""I like to watch,"" he tells Shirley Maclaine's character, who comes to revel in it, never having been so satisfied as she does whatever it is she has to do to take care of her self while Chauncy looks on.  Probably a scene that the Being There could have done without.

Some viewers may quite understandably take Being There as a cynical affirmation of our ability to see what we want to see and believe what we want to believe.  I think, however, that the film is better understood as a testimonial to a yearning for true innocence, unvarnished honesty, a fundamental simplicity in a thoroughly corrupted world. suffused with dissembling, temporizing, lying, and brutality masquerading as hard-nosed realism.  Unfortunately, However, in the 21st Century each of us needs a thick carapace of pretense and artificial polish to keep from being crushed.  However, without being sappy or maudlin, Being There shows us the attraction of an alternative.  I'm the most cynical person I know, but you don't have to be squishy soft and hopelessly deluded to appreciate Being There; you just need to be imbued with a last faint trace of wistful idealism.

The final scene, in which Chauncy literally walks on water, is problematic.  Is this a metaphorical testimonial to the power of innocence, honesty, and lack of guile in an ugly world where nothing is what it seems and all is self-seeking and corruption?  Or is it an hallucination of a man so limited in experience and lacking in worldly scope that he sees what he wants to see?  I think it's the former.

If we take Being There literally, it's just another characterization of the ease with which we are manipulated and the stupidity of the categories we bring to bear on interpreting the world.  If we take it as a metaphorical statement as to our long-last naturalness and innocent inclination to take things as we find them, it is a charming antidote to the suspicion and cynicism that imbues our lives.",1323475200,,4288,4.962237762237762
349095,3,6301590740,"For myself, growing up in the 1990s, the quintessential film simpleton is Forrest Gump, but before him there was Peter Sellers in the 1979 film BEING THERE. Sellers plays Chance, a dim-witted gardener who, after the death of his employer, finds himself cast into Washington D.C. society. Unable to offer more to a conversation than a few remarks about gardening, Chance ends up being a rising political star, as his interlocutors (and eventually the American public) treat him as the mirror of their own opinions.

All in all, I found BEING THERE an enjoyable film but no unmissable classic. The cinematography isn't memorable, and there are two exceedingly lame scenes of sexual humour. Sellers' performance as this man-child is solid, though one wishes for more of the variety of other roles. Sadly, the film's message -- that in American politics people latch on to vacuous soundbites instead of seeking competent leaders -- is still as timely as it was several decades ago.",1322352000,,977,5.030864197530864

Now I do not think I have any great insights into human nature or that I have powers of perception into the character of individuals that surpass either the President of the United States or his entourage. I therefore spent the whole film watching very intelligent people (yes, you do have to be intelligent to get where they were - and please do not instance George Bush Jr) respond to this buffoon with a level of culpable naivety that just was not believable.

I am ready to criticise politicians with the best, but found this route to mockery, in view of its lack of credibility (it is a satire, by the way, not a comedy),  had no power to successfully satirise. For me, the people mocked are the writers rather than anyone else. It reminds me of another film, but in that one only the ending is silly (Fail Safe), and in both instances the overwhelming majority of reviewers think they are fine films.

349223,5,6301590740,"After I finished watching this movie, I thought of the Tao te Ching, which says that that which is low will be raised up, and that softness will outlast hardness. This movie fable shows how that can happen, while having a sense of the larger social structure that mean some benefit and others don't.  Chance the gardener is sent out from the house where he's lived his whole life.  He's not quite right in the head and only knows what he's seen on TV.  A chance encounter with Eve (Shirley McClaine) brings him into the world of the rich and famous and renames him Chauncey Gardiner.  Everyone sees in him what they want to see and what they want to be.  He is a blank screen for their projections, and by the end of the film he's gone from a nobody to being bandied about as the next president.

There are a lot of funny moments here, but underneath it is a very dark view of human nature.  Chance is separate and untouchable, and others feel a connection, but it is mainly through their ego and the pleasure of projecting on him what they want.  The clearest example comes when Eve throws herself at Chance, then pleasures herself alone.  She thinks he's watching, but he's really watching TV and at one point he withdraws his hand so he can do the yoga he sees on the screen. So even the act of love, which could be a moment of great connection, is emphatically made of two different and completely separate experiences.  Here I disagree with Roger Ebert, who says the two sex subplots are unnecessary.  They both show the lack of connection between people, but in very different ways.  For most people in the film, being there means being alone.",1293494400,9,1649,4.46

349225,5,6301590740,"I may be wrong about Peter Sellers, but he impresses me as being a quiet, educated man of great accomplishment.  His career more than likely gave Peter Sellers a profound understanding of acting, film making, and other business side details; making him a savvy individual with worthwhile mentoring skills.  I'm talking about the man, not a role he played.  Peter Sellers served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, rising to the rank of corporal.  His comic genius in the ""Pink Panther"" series of films has yet to be rivaled.  Peter Sellers had friendship ties with George Harrison and Ringo Starr of the Beatles notoriety, as well as Roman Polanski, Princess Margaret, and Sophia Loren.  Peter Sellers was the first man to appear on the cover of Playboy magazine (April 1964 with Karen Lynn), and purportedly socialized on at least one occasion to have tea with the Queen Mother at Clarence House.  Peter was married to Anne Howe, divorced, remarried to Britt Ekland, divorced, remarried to Miranda Quarry (now the Countess of Stockton), divorced, and remarried to Lynne Frederick.  He passed away in July of 1980, leaving behind an estate worth an estimated 4.5 million.
Which brings us to the 1979 release of ""Being There"" which must have been very enjoyable for Peter Sellers to challenge himself in such a role as Chauncey Gardner, a simple, totally without education man who grew up on a humble estate and as servant there, and had never left the property throughout his lifetime.  All he knows about life is what he has seen on TV.  Now Chauncey Gardner is in his 60's, and the property owner dies, which means Peter Sellers's character has been evicted out onto the street with no place to go, no direction, no explanation, and totally clueless altogether about what happens next.  Supported by a cast such as Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warden, Richard Basehart, Richard Dysart, Melvyn Douglas, and others, ""Being There"" is a film based upon a book by the author Jerzy Kosinski, and two things stand out in the critical reviews of this film regarding Peter Sellers's performance.  Some say this film was the crowning triumph of his remarkable career, whereas others have said this film's fantastic black comedy premise would never have been as credible without Peter Sellers achieving a pinpoint sharp exactitude of nothingness.  Simply stated, the character of Chauncey Gardner is one of a helpless childlike simpleton, who accidentally ends up as advisor to the President of the United States.
This is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time.  Peter Sellers surpassed my expectations in ""Being There"" and I can't recommend this movie highly enough for those who appreciate irony, satire, dark comedy, and understand the genius that is Peter Sellers.  It doesn't hurt that Shirley MacLaine is a high-society wife of a prominent rich business tycoon, and as the elderly tycoon's life is ebbing away (Melvyn Douglas), Shirley MacLaine's character (Eve)  is drawn emotionally and passionately to the character played by Peter Sellers - which ends up wonderfully because of misunderstandings and the two consummate professional actor/actress stars displaying a geometric progression of their individual talent which culminates in ""Being There"" as multi-level entertainment you'll watch many, many times.  Shirley MacLaine is hot, in other words.  Very hot.
I'd give this movie 10 stars if I could.  Mind blowing film.  Definitely worth owning.",1289174400,4,3452,5.086879432624113
349226,5,6301590740,"I know a lot of moviegoers are expecting a plot that spells out what to think, lots of obvious subplots, and special effects.  If you want obvious comedy, this isn't the movie for you.  I think from reading all the different reviews you can see how many way's this movie can be interpreted, and that's what's so good about it.  I think every one of us can relate to different aspects of this movie, where the simplistic is made into so much more than it is.  Simple words are interpreted into something more complex by people who aren't accepting to simplicity.  So if you want a thought provoking movie, where you won't get the deeper meaning without some thought about the plot, then you're going to think this is the best Peter Sellers movie ever made, as I do.  If you want a movie that's in your face, tells you everything you should be thinkiing, and is obvious in every way, you're probably going to hate this movie.  I know one review mentions Obamamania, but I think it relates to any type of mania where the superficial surface is all that you see.  If you're from my era it's the philsophical quotes of John Lennon, not so much what he says, but the fact that he said it, so it must be important.  So as it points out in the film description, this isn't slapstick comedy as in The Pink Panther, but more along the lines of The Mouse That Roared.  The meaning behind the film is more important to the enjoyment of it, rather than rolling over laughing, as in a lot of Peter Sellers films.  If you want to think, you'll love this film, but if Star Wars, speaking of accepting the absurd, is your cup of tea, don't waste your time.",1288915200,2,1639,4.358552631578948

A story just about right for a Senior Class production at your average High School, but the screenplay and performances are so brilliant that the viewer sits mesmerized during the 130 minutes. One mmorable, quotable scene after another, beautifully captured.

If a viewer likes ro dissect a movie thre's a good amonunt of impossibly improbable stuff to poke at in this 1979 release - some parts have not dated well (although someone with no traceable background might garner about 22 million hits on youtube)- but the *message* holds absolutely true for today: ""Image"" is all-important and even the aristocratic types can be impressed and motivated by what they *read into* a person.

Plenty of satire on the powers-that-be in the Corporate World, in the Executive branch, and where they meet. With today's agenda-driven Cable TV outlets, a person's resume is secondary to the rhetoric they can deliver. Chancey Gardner just might win a full-time Host gig on Foxnews, today.

349279,5,6301590740,"Sellers is spot on as humble, amusing, and simple-minded Chance who, through circumstances not of his own doing, winds up woven into the lives of the rich and powerful.  This occurs principally via the vulnerabilities and loneliness of those around him, but occassionally on account of the silliness that accompanies arrogance and pomp.  Kosinski's scathing indictment of television, journalism, politics, consumerism, and power is fun to watch as social commentary; the humorous treatment of the daily lunacies in our lives accounts for the film's now iconic stature.  But it is a slowly paced story, about moments, and momentariness.  How the film fills those moments is critical.  And it is Sellers' performance as the half-wit who wins over hearts, while inadvertently disguising his true mental capacity, which is the film's emotional life blood that fills those moments brilliantly.  Film-making lore says Sellers lobbied hard for the role, feeling he had one more great character to introduce to the world.  Whether people actually feel such looming deadlines is a matter of debate.  But Sellers knew he was a sick man and had already suffered a number of heart attacks.  So much has been written about his performance that it's easy to forget that there is no Chauncey Gardiner without all of the people around him who create the character he becomes, leaving the cast's ensemble performance a keen requirement for the story's success.  Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine Being There without Peter Sellers.  The way the celebrity of an under achiever is launched via his ""natural"" way and our gullibility foresaw a more recent real-life rising political celebrity and her own ""folksy"" way.  As the protagonist's name implies however, Being There may be nothing more than a story about chance.  Nevertheless, whether it is Kosinski's characters, Deschanel's cinematography, Sellers' performance, or the intersection of all these things, there's a charm about Being There that casts a spell which stays on the viewer for a long time to come.",1280275200,,2048,5.226299694189603

He is convincing in the role of Chancy Gardiner, a man who has never known any life outside the home where he grew up and where he worked as a gardener. This is not a comedy, but the movie is full of humor as he is always misunderstood and he himself misunderstands the others. In a bizarre way he is seen as a wise philosopher, eventually even being considered as the only person capable of becoming president of the USA in order to save the country from an economic disaster. The only recommendation I would have for the serious movie viewer is to stop the movie after the last scene before the credits start rolling. During the credits some funny scenes are shown, taken during the actual filming of the movie, but it is an anticlimax after this tremendous movie.

Kosinski's satire isn't limited to the effects of media culture on people and society -- it productively branches off into related areas. The satire is so rich for such a short novel that it becomes difficult to provide a coherent exegesis. But I'll try.

There's nothing cryptic about the title's meaning. A man who's ""experienced"" life vicariously only through what he's seen on television, suddenly finds himself ""being there"", in the ""real"" world, which he has essentially no understanding of. He has trouble making the distinction, as we see when he uses a remote control to try to shut off a disagreeable young man.

Chance isn't congenitally stupid -- he's been ""stupi-fied"" by watching so much TV. This is not accidental. The Old Man who took him in as a child paid no attention to his education. Chance provided labor for nothing more than the cost of feeding and clothing him; his development as a human being was of no importance. (It's noteworthy that Louise, the Old Man's black maid, though claiming to have raised Chance, made no effort to teach him to read and write.) The poke at capitalism is obvious -- even heavy-handed -- but it could apply to any society in which the worth of the indvidual is not of primary importance. *

Chance's vapidity is a ""tabula rasa"" on which others' values and views are written. But the projection is largely due to the listener's unwillingness to hear what the speaker is actually saying. People hear what they want to hear, and ""Being There"" is also an indictment of our failure to ""be there"" with those with whom we engage in conversation.

Chance's repeated ""I like to watch"" has obvious voyeuristic connotations, which were confirmed in a Dick Cavett interview where Jerzy Kosinki revealed that he liked to go to public baths to watch people having sex. Most people found (and still find) this shocking, but I've never understood why ""voyeurism"" is considered a disorder (unless it replaces sex). Humans are highly visual animals, and we all ""like to watch"" all sorts of things, which is one of the reasons television has taken over so much of our lives.

The projection of our inner lives on the outer world of television and movies can block the development of an ""inner dialog"" that can help us make sense of our own lives and what is going on around us. (Fundamentalist religion also has this effect.) Chance is lost in the outer world, in part because he has no inner world in which to retreat and figure out things. His is the ultimate ""candidness"", in which everything is on the surface. ""There is no there, there"", as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland.

It is all-too tempting to paint Ronald Reagan as a real-life Chance, and I won't resist the temptation. It is difficult to understand why such a vacuous idiot was elected to the Presidency, but it was partly due to his very shallowness, which allowed even people who disagreed strongly with his policies to find him ""likeable"". How can one like a stupid person who has nothing of any value to contribute? It is no surprise that, at the end, the power brokers are thinking that Chance should run for the Presidency.

The film was made at Peter Sellers' encouragement, as he viewed the novel as a vehicle for his acting skills. It's a near-perfect performance (unlike, say, Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", where we're constantly aware we're watching an actor pretend to be something he isn't). Although the novel describes Chance as handsome and athletic, the older and somewaht vacant-looking Sellers is a better choice for the film, as removes the possibility people think well of him simply because he's good-looking. The other performances are mostly good, with Maclaine, Dysart, and Douglas standing out. Douglas's Oscar-winning performance, in particular, is a fine example of acting without appearing to act.

The ending -- not in the novel -- spins the story in a direction Kosinski did not intend. Is Chance the fool of God? Is he so cut off from the material world that its laws no long apply to him, and he can walk on water -- perhaps because he doesn't understand it isn't possible (as suggested by the tag line on Rand's tomb, ""Life is a state of mind"")? Either way, the story's meaning is softened and blunted. Chance is neither hero nor divine.

Other than this misstep, Ashby's direction is spot-on, giving the material the weight it needs to be believable. A lighter tone would call too much attention to the satire. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful, highlighting Caleb Deschanel rich photography.

Thematically, ""Being There"" recalls ""Rear Window"" (voyeurism) and ""Network"" (media corruption of the ""inner self"").

The film is very good, and the novel great, arguably one of the best of the 20th century.

349352,5,6301590740,"""Being There""-- so what DOES the title mean? Ilana Douglas, (real-life granddaughter of Melvyn Douglas, whose impeccable portrayal of the old tycoon justifiably won him his second Oscar in a long and worthy career) in the short reminisce that comprises the entirety of the ""special features"", said that to her ""Being There"" meant being in the moment. That Peter Sellers' characterization of the man known alternately as Chance the Gardener and Chauncey Gardener was so strong it kind of drug everyone else in and there was a kind of onscreen reality, if you will, a ""being in the moment"" that happened and made this film the profound masterpiece that it is.

 I am not one to disagree with that take. It is equally viable as any of my own thoughts on the subject, (depending on your point of view) yet perhaps there is more to it than that. I have found that many trully great pieces of art posses a certain ambiguity about them that goes beyond anything the author originally intended. A meaning that is only revealed through the realization of the work itself, a force which surpasses any conceptual inspiration. I think this is the ""Being There"" that Ilana Douglas refers to. When Peter Sellers went ""full-on retard"", as it were, ""full-on shut-in"" rather, the rest of the cast could not but help to follow suit in their portrayals of what are essentially cultural caricatures, and magic was made in front of the camera lens. No denying that. However, there is another aspect of ""Being There"", something that may in fact be more intentional and blatant as conceived by the author of the book this film is based on, yet, because most people aren't willing to climb the ladder's top rung, usually remains much more evasive.

Follow me if you will down this rabbit hole;
 I couldn't help thinking that it harks back to the old adage about ""being a fly on the wall"". Have you ever had that notion when thinking about how the corporate sector and the political structure of our country and the world is really run at the top? To be a fly on the wall during those subtle, intimate moments when old, bloodless creatures congregate and deals are struck, policies are shifted and Atlas shrugs? Of course we are able to see the aftermath of many of these moments, which allows those of us who get beyond the smoke and mirrors and dog and pony tricks to understand the nature of the course our society is on, and where it is being steered-- but to hear it from their own curmudgeonly lips! To hear them acknowledge public sentiment against their tyranny yet justify it as necessary for the good of the species in the long run!-- perhaps just after they've been pumped full of another fresh batch of blood to keep them in good spirits as per Chance's first encounter with old Ben Rand. ""Some call me a 'kingmaker', but I've stayed true to myself, and that's what matters most of all , my boy.""

 Wasn't this concept (the fly on the wall, the emotionless being who likes to watch, etc.) the onus of what this film was actually all about? One of the most cleverly disguised depictions of what life is really like at the top? To be a master of the world, to live as if life will never end, as if you will be at the controls forever, and yet, to still be powerless against death when your time has come. To have it all, to live in opulence and luxury while the rest of the world goes to the dogs,(as so poignantly depicted when the Gardener leaves the house he's spent his whole life shut up in for the first time) yet, in the end, to be drug down to Sheol with the rest of us.

 So it is that we get to observe our overlords (or at least their caricatures) throught the glinted eyes of a perpetual voyeur (the fly on the wall), the only one of us ""down-to-earth"" enough to be allowed within their hallowed walls. A character sought after and hobknobbed by the upper eschalon by virtue of his rare optimism and seeming lack of judgementalism, a trait which tends to infect all those of us not quite placated enough to be content to just watch.
 Which begs the question concerning the ""common man""'s role in modern civilization; are we nothing more than voyeurs? Our thoughts shaped and controlled by the fabricated envoirnment we live in on this tedius journey through life, watching the big men make their moves on deck while kept safely locked away down in the holding regions below?

 How about that tomb, eh? A beautiful, little beady eye that makes the one on the back of the dollar bill look like a pale imitation. A legacy for a proud, life-long upholder of The Code, a fitting monument, built in finely hewn stone, built to last. The pallbearers hastily deciding momentous strategy in hushed tones while bringing the old man to his tomb-- er, ah...""final resting place"". The show must go on, plenty more runners to snatch up the baton and carry on.

 Jack Warden as president!! The first time he appears onscreen is from afar, yet I recognized his craggy features (talk about finely hewn!)from that instant and it filled my heart with glee. What a man, eh? From ""Twelve Angry Men"", to ""...And Justice For All"", to ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"", one was never disappointed with a performance from old Jack. Or his cousin Robert Loggia, for that matter. (Somehow the two are inexplicably linked within the caverns of my mind.) Fitting how his character eulogized the deceased, his own doubts and impotence weighing on him like a roped man at the gallows.

 Yes, a lot to digest in this flick, many a hearty meal for the cranial sponge to soak in. Watch it again and again, let it marinate your senses.

Unfortunately, he was not the first U.S. President to hold those credentials: Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan come immediately to mind (the last two come from California I am sorry to say).

But I digress... Peter Sellers was amazing as Chance the gardener. But I have to give this performance second place to his brilliant acting in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, where he plays three characters that carry the entire film. Third place would go to another Kubrick movie, Lolita, where Sellers plays writer Clare Quilty.

349420,5,6301590740,"An amazingly wonderful possibility takes root and grows in the most unlikely setting imaginable. What emerges is a truly witty and triumphant story. `Being There' allows us to look at what we have become as a society and tears down the ladders we are expected to climb. What is left is a revealing look at the common denominator and the math involved in obtaining it. Along the way, it becomes clear that friendship, understanding and love are unaffected by the simplicity of one's actions. Indeed, we find that it sprinkles the pathway with a chance to read one's intent not through words, but by thinking, searching one's eyes and trusting our instincts.

Peter Sellers is deeply entrenched in a character that may be the hardest role for someone of his intellect, oratory gifts, and physical presence to inhabit. I am not sure that I have ever seen a film that so brilliantly uses reactions as a major part of the script. This also makes for hilarious `what if' scenarios. Sellers' talent for this goes without saying. He is joined by an impressive array of old Hollywood talent who compliment his every gesture.

Melvyn Douglas rightfully earned the Oscar for his portrayal of Benjamin Rand, somewhat of a J. Paul Getty industrialist who has one foot in the grave and the President's ear as well. Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Eve, Rand's devoted but antsy wife. Ms. MacLaine is always a good bet to take over any film she is cast in, and she steals several scenes. In one, she leaves us rolling on the floor laughing.

Jack Warden builds a role as the crafty and cranky President into a fine performance. Initially, it appeared that he would be used sparingly, but his subsequent scenes were very good. Ruth Attaway portrays Louise, a woman burdened by the truth, yet rightfully embittered by it. Richard Dysart provides intrigue as the skeptical Doctor Allenby.

`Being There' was directed by Hal Ashby. He was afforded an excellent script, cast, and crew. I think one of the reasons that great actors require great directors is due to their immersion into their roles. Mr. Ashby had the ability, as they say in sports, to `see the whole field'. It was an essential ingredient to making this a classic film. The movie was filmed in 1979, and there is much to date it. Yet, the core elements are timeless.

The movie is now on Blu-ray. There are a few extras, such as memories of the filming, an alternate ending and deleted scenes. It does look nice, but do not expect the normal HD experience. It was filmed almost 30 years ago. However, I sent this to the top of my Netflix list on the strength of its story. That and a message that I need to be reminded of from time to time when life seems absurd.

349422,5,6301590740,"Peter Sellers plays Chance the long time gardener for a wealthy gentlemen who dies early in the film. Chance's life revolves around television and gardening. He has a TV close by wherever he is, even while working. His ability to communicate with others is limited to parroting what he hears and sees on TV. Put out on the street (literally) when the owner dies with nothing but a suitcase full of the owner's custom made suits (perfect fit except about 3 inches short in the legs) he tries to find what life has next. A minor accident lands him in the home of a wealthy and dying industrialist who has a powerful influence on the presidency. (the film is set in D.C.) who assumes that his cryptic speech and tailor made clothes represent an eccentric genius. (The real genius is Seller's acting in the film) His 'words of wisdom' (often the most recent words he has seen on TV) take on a life of their own when coming from the mouth of this 'genius'. Read Roger Ebert's review for a more in depth discussion of the various levels of interpretation one might read into the film. While not everyone (action oriented viewers) will appreciate this film, it is a terrific satire on our culture and the way people react with pre-conceived perceptions of the way people dress and talk. While set in D.C., a great deal of the movie is filmed at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina, an unbelievable landmark.

One of Peter Sellers' final and, perhaps, best performance, the role of Chance the gardener is a huge departure from the typical, over-the-top, slapstick comedic roles for which he is so well known and loved.  An amazing mixture of political satire, social commentary, and Biblical metaphor, BEING THERE is strangely prophetic and very relevant to our own current political drama.

In BEING THERE, we meet Chance the Gardener (Peter Sellers), a mentally handicapped man who has learned everything he knows from TV and has had no other interaction with the outside world.  Chance appears to have been born in the garden, and has never been outsides its walls.  When his employer, the Old Man, dies, Chance is thrown into the real world. Chance's initial interactions with the outside world are very innocent, simplistic, and very literal.  When the wife (Shirley MacLaine) of a wealthy power broker (Melvyn Douglas) accidently hits Chance with her car, he finds himself hanging out with the rich and famous.  To Chance, these are just people, people whose kindnesses and words he takes at face value.  Yet these people believe that Chance is great man and a great scholar; they believe that his simple observations about plants are rich metaphors for life, business, and politics.  Chance becomes a valued and well known advisor to the rich and famous, to the country, and to the world.

While Peter Sellers is always fun, in BEING THERE the humor is more muted and subtle.  BEING THERE is a successful mockery of political conceit and the effects of seeing what you want to see. The character of Chance is a mirror; the people who go to him for advice see what they want to see - what they NEED to see - whether the subject is political, business, or just plain life.  To me, BEING THERE is a new, updated version of the old fable The Emperor's New Clothes.

Peter Sellers is outstanding in this, his penultimate role. His performance is subtle, calm, and nuanced to near perfection.  He makes you want to laugh, to cry, and to just plain hope.  Shirley MacLaine as a woman looking for love and Melvyn Douglas as her dying, powerful husband are both superb.  In fact the entire cast does a marvelous job.

As previously stated, BEING THERE is thoughtful, understated film, brilliant in its simplicity.  The finale of the film is a subject of much debate, but like Chance, himself, I think the ending is what you want it to be.

The elegance of the plot is that almost everyone - from the overly indulged wife of a wealthy and powerful man to the president himself and TV audiences use Chance as a mirror for their own hopes and beliefs.

Despite the comedy there is a sad thread that runs through the movie speaking to the human condition and the randomness of life.  One of my favorite scenes is when Chance the Gardener having spent most of his life working as a gardener and watching TV finally steps out into the real world complete with TV remote. He attempts to 'change the channel' using the remote when he is confronted by a crowd of hoodlums.

The end of the movie is enigmatic and adds a strange almost religious twist to the movie. Western readers may be interested to hear that the film's ending was changed or removed in several countries since it was seen as blasphemous.

Writing this review at a time when the global economy seems to be lurching towards depression many of Chance's utterings are apposite -""in in the fall we need to do some trimming and in the winter the garden lies fallow, but in the spring there is growth"".

I've seen it mentioned in other reviews too, but the whole Barack Obama phenomenon is so reminiscent of Being There.  An unproven man who comes out of nowhere with an unclear background and experience; a populace desperate for change that uses his vague statements about hope and change to reflect their own hopes and beliefs.

But more importantly, this is one of the best films of the past thirty years, with a flawless performance by the late great Peter Sellers as Chance the gardener, an elegant, polite gentleman who woos the elite in Washington, all of them blind to the fact that poor Chance is a sheltered simpleton who looks good on camera but hasn't the foggiest clue what's going on around him. He likes to watch tv. That's about it. Out on the streets for the first time in his fiftysomething years, he encounters a gang of hoodlums and tries to turn them off with the remote control he took from the house he was forced to vacate. At first, he's really quite heartbreaking, and you want him to be saved by the stupid elitists, and lo and behold, he is. And then you are relieved. And then, towards the end of the movie, you say, hey, wait a minute, this idiot may be headed for the White House and then WE will be the ones in the heartbreaking situation. Some may say this is the story of Dubya, too. Well, maybe. I'm an ignorant, nonpartisan independent registered voter. All I know for sure is, with all these Pink Panther remakes and Austin Powers-Love Guru comedies all over the place (and I love both Steve Martin and Mike Myers, who is our modern day Sellers), all one can say is, I miss you so much, Peter Sellers!!! (oh, I should add, the extras on this dvd are REALLY disappointing - I was looking forward to a full length making of documentary, not Illeana Douglas talking on camera for 15 minutes - that + a trailer is all you get, no commentary nothing - I know just about everyone from the picture is dead but couldn't Shirley MacLaine step out of one of her lives for a couple of hours to reminisce?)",1234656000,4,1723,4.370716510903427
349525,4,6301590740,"This is a comedy classic.  It is arguably the best film about television ever made.  And it is clearly the best film about ""the suit makes the man"" to the extreme.

And it looks better than it ever has before.

But it could look better.  Black levels are poor, with murky grays everywhere, and noise reduction has been over-used.  One professional review notes: ""the studio applied some aggressive Digital Noise Reduction. The problem is quite severe in some scenes, especially the opening. Film grain freezes in place while the action of the scene moves around it. Detail is mushy, and objects smear when in motion.""

The sound is good.  You really get the clear-but-clanky presentation of the TV shows that form the backgroun or foreground of many scenes.  But beware, for some bizarre reason, the default soundtrack is not the lossless track, but the DD1.0 track. Whose silly idea was that?",1234224000,37,893,4.860927152317881
349526,5,6301590740,"A mixture of political/social satire and metaphor, ""Being There"" was Peter Sellers' penultimate performance and also one of his finest. Sellers plays Chance a mentally handicapped gardener for a wealthy man who has learned everything he knows from TV and has had little interaction with the outside world. When his employer dies, Chance is thrown into the real world. When the wife (Shirley MacLaine)of a wealthy power broker (Oscar winner Melvyn Douglas) accidently hits Chance with her car, he finds himself hanging out with the rich and famous. Everyone believes that Chance's simple observations about plants are rich metaphors for life making him something of a celebrity.

Hal Ashby's film receives a sharp looking transfer and while the film may have faded a bit, the muted tone suit the film I just can't recall if it looked quite this dull in its original release. The film has been cleaned up for its high definition debut and doesn't look overprocessed. Audio sounds quite good and is presented with its original mono soundtrack.

The extras on the Blu-ray are quite good but not qutie as extensive as I would have hoped given the reputation of the film. We get a featurette on the making of the film with Douglas' granddaughter actress Ilena Douglas sharing her memories of the making of the film. MacLaine is curiously absent. We also get a pair of deleted scenes that were recently discovered as well as the gag reel which ran during the credits in the original film (they are still there, too) and a pair of interviews with Sellers and Ashby tacked on to this section as well. The original theatrical trailer is included.

I'm disappointed that there wasn't anything on Sellers' next-to-last role. He had lobbied for the part when he first read Jerzy Kosinki's novel back in the early 70's but couldn't get anyone to finance it with him in the part. Although MacLaine is the only surviving major cast member there are others that could have commented on the film, Sellers' performance and Ashby's career as a direcor. It also would have been nice to see a featurette on Ashby and novelist/screenwriter Jerzy Kosinski.

While the extras are kind of meager (running less than 30 minutes) the film looks very nice and continues to be a classic.",1234137600,3,2256,4.8671875

349528,5,6301590740,"This is a wonderful film that I saw theatrically some 30 years ago. This blu-ray is sharp and film like, with muted colors appropriate to the story, but still very nice to finally watch in hi def. Don't expect it to look like a modern day film. I saw several subtle things I hadn't noticed before, because of the sharp resolution.

The extras are nice, but brief. One short scene and one 'extension' plus the alternate (original) ending. Also, there's a promo piece for distributors with Peter and Hal Ashby. Nice to have these, but I'm wondering what happened to all those hours of videotapes of alternates of the whole film that I read about before. Were they poor quality or impossible to find? I heard some crumbled into dust when played back so perhaps they're gone for good.

The making of only has Illana Douglas (granddaughter of Melvyn)who was on set as a youngster. (Where is Shirley Maclaine? Most of the others are, of course, no longer with us.)

While some might call him retarded, to me he seems more ""vacant"".  As a Zen saying goes, in the beginner's mind there are infinite possibilities, in the expert's mind, very few.  Chauncey has beginner's mind, of a sort.  The brilliance of this film is the depiction of how these ""experts,"" the other characters in the film, perceive in Chauncey this world of possibility (to the point of him being considered for the Presidency).  This reaction is because they see a blank canvas for their own desires, to be played out on a good and wise and untainted man, who resembles their own such qualities lost (or given up) long ago.

This film displays deep insight into the character and state of modern man, depicted subtly and poignantly.  If one doesn't get it, perhaps one is too deeply embedded in the game of modern life?",1230768000,,999,4.7398843930635834
349532,4,6301590740,"I remember when I first saw this film on tv many, many years ago I really liked it.  Something about the whole thing spoke to me; I liked the way it took its time to develop and I was very impressed with the great acting by the cast and especially the great script.  Now seeing it again many years later, I've actually grown to appreciate it even more and I've come to realise that not only is this one of the great comedies of the 70s but it is also one of the best films of that decade and it is certainly among my all-time favourite movies.

Melvyn Douglas totally deserves his Oscar and Sellers shows himself to be an excellent actor playing a very controlled and subdued yet powerful role and while it may not be his best ever performance as that would have to be his work on ""Dr Strangelove ..."" it is certainly a close second and while many may remember him for his Pink Panther roles I will always remember him by this excellent movie.

This dvd version is rather good as the picture quality although not perfect is still very good although the sound quality although also good as far as mono goes only comes in this format.  There are no special features either which is a shame and I look forward to a future release of this great film in either standard or Blu-ray formats with restored picture quality and at least a 5.1 surround sound option.  A classic like this film deserves the best treatment as far as restoration goes although it is still a worthy dvd version as it is to enjoy one of the few films out there which rewards repeated viewing.

349569,4,6301590740,"I missed ""Being There"" when it came out and I never seemed to find it later on TV so I finally rented it to see what all the excitement was about.  I now understand the reputation it has accrued and I must say that I really did enjoy it.  I can't see my way to rating it with ""5 Stars"" but ""4 Stars"" is certainly an indication of my respect and appreciation of this quality film.  I laughed out loud on several occassions but the more common reaction I got was one of curiosity.  Although everything that takes place in ""Being There"" seems to be normal, I never knew what to expect next.  That's because, in the midst of all these characters who play their expected roles, there is one person who is completely out of place.  Right from the beginning we are aware of who this character is and why he is so out of place.  We just aren't prepared for the places he goes, the people he meets and the things he does.  At times we see the parody of lifestyles, at times the parody of philosphies, at time the parodies of relationships, and at times the parodies of something else (we may not fully grasp what the parody is of...but we know it must be a parody).

The movie, will draw you in if you let it.  Although I am often too pragmatic for my own good, I found it easy to be drawn into ""Being There"".  A cursory look at some other reviews tells me others were not.  I think the way this movie succeeds is the way the character was set up for us.  I recall seeing ""The Sixth Sense"" years ago when it came out.  I was insulted not by the movie but by a trailer in which the writer and director reviewed scenes in which a deceased character was able to believe that he was actually alive based on his perceived interaction with living persons.  Their contention was; See! You doubted that this could happen but we just showed you how it could!  OK, I thought, that proves your point for those 7 or 8 scenes but they took place over several days at least and you don't account for what this character did the rest of his time.  In ""Being There"" we never need to concern ourselves with such pragmatic issues because we know that Chance Gardner is usually going to be off by himself watching TV.  We can accept that the only scenes with him interacting with others were the only ones that actually occurred.  (My pragmatism often works overtime).  We can accept him as he is which enables viewers like myself to then accept everything else that happens as well.

The ending is a bit peculiar and left me reviewing what I had seen.  There is an opportunity to elevate the meaning of ""Being There"" depending on how you react to that final scene.  Personally, I thought it was simply more parody only this time it was of us.",1222473600,,2715,4.2907662082514735

349571,5,6301590740,"It's been nearly three decades (ugh!) since I saw this film in the theater and always remembered it as being one of the great movies of all time - intelligent, witty, satirical, and thought-provoking. Sadly, I hadn't had a chance (no pun intended) to see it since and, while browsing for something to watch that would transport me to another place (something that all good movies should do), I remembered ""Being There."" To my great delight, I was surprised to find a copy.

Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled with my decision to buy this movie. The wit and humor remain as powerful today as it was when the movie was first shown. The only part that seemed ""dated"" where the 70's clothes and styles but that only ads to the movie's ""character.""

Granted, the movie may appear ""slow"" to some but, like a good piece of music, every moment needs to be savored in order to fully appreciate every nuance of the magnificent script and brilliant performance of each actor; without question, this was Peter Sellers' finest performance, Shirley McLaine was magnificent, Melvyn Douglas was brilliant, and Richard Dysart was superlative.

The film is fraught with all kinds of unanswered (but intriguing) questions which leave intelligent audiences with countless topics for discussion. For example, just who (or what) was Chauncey Gardner? Other reviews (rather disturbingly) refer to Sellers' character as ""learning disabled,"" ""retarded,"" a ""simpleton,"" and other epithets and yet, other than the hilarious comments by the maid that Gardner ""has no brains at all. Stuffed with rice pudding between the ears. Short-changed by the Lord and dumb as a jackass"" we really don't know why he led such a bizarrely sheltered life that centered on his need to watch TV and his childlike behavior that exuded strength and confidence to so many others. Why was ""Chancy"" left alone? By whom? Why did the maid leave Chauncey after having taken care of him for so many years?

Of course, that's all part of the mystery that makes this such a sublime masterpiece - there are a lot of questions for which answers are not needed in order for the genius of this film to succeed. People will continue to debate the mysteries of the film including such things as who stated """"I understand"" at the death bed of one of the characters, or the meaning of very last scene, forever. Obviously, there are no real answers to these and trying to answer them is simply futile. I would strongly suspect that that was exactly what this film was trying to accomplish - to get people to argue over something that really doesn't exist (or doesn't matter) - while, at the same time, ignoring more important issues. The real brilliance of the movie; however, is found with the amount of satire - almost nothing is sacred in this movie if one has that courage to really take a good look at exactly what is being said. Every word (especially those uttered by Sellers) is spoken with precisely the right amount of meaning, nuance, and inflection required. Some may feel that this movie is ""slow"" but the slothfulness of the main character and his careful, yet simplistic, dialog with others (in contrast to the constant cacophony of a blaring TV which he surrounds himself with), is precisely what makes this movie so great.",1215907200,3,3281,4.822380106571936
349572,1,6301590740,"The word 'awful' doesn't even get near to describing how bad this movie is. 'Appalling' or 'crass' would be more apt, but even then I would be tempted to use an expletive intensifier with it. The idea itself has some sort of value, there is some satire in the motiff of a pure simpleton becoming the most listened to man in any major political regime, never mind the White House. And yet...! And yet the outcome here is a terribly contrived, horrendously artificial, and maddeningly overwritten piece of cliche.

The thing is, I like some of the actors in it. The actor who plays the pres - sorry, I can't remember his name - is a pretty good character actor who adds a bit of colour to films he's in, and Ms McClaine is a fine female foil and always entertaining. Then there is Sellers - the man is a bona fide genius, I love him as an actor, there is no one who quite shares his gift for characterisation, not Sim, not even Guinness. But his judgment was way off when he took on this preposterously OTT role. A screenplay like that should have gone straight in the bin, and his agent should have been sacked for giving it to him. The whole thing is just so painful to watch, a blatant and totally predictable narrative is so slowly, so uninterestingly constructed and there is hardly any dramatic tension in it, even at the points where the screenwriter has demanded their should be some, but it is just lifelessly directed, so flatly played by everyone, seemingly concentrating so hard on playing it straight, including Sellers, that it just comes across as flat, one dimensional, and artificial. A TRULY awful project from beginning to end, no way at all to be remembering one of the greatest comedy actors of cinema. And I don't agree with the consensus that this was a great performance.

I believe they were trying to demonstrate how absurdities in public life and politics become accepted and no one challenges them because of who accepts them.  I do think they succeeded.  But I kept thinkig about where I would have gone with the theme and they did not go there.  The ending was one more absurdity on top of the rest with Gardener walking across the surface of the lake.

349652,5,6301590740,"This is one of the films that make you think about it long after the credits were gone and Rafael finally received his message. What was it? The comedy? Political satire? The Drama? Gospel according Jerry, Hal and Peter? What is it about Chance the Gardner aka Chauncey Gardiner (Peter Sellers) simple minded, possibly retarded character that everyone admires so much?

It is a prophetic film - how often we've seen individuals that have been elevated to high political office for simply looking good and smiling nice on television. It is a story of a man who was an embodiment of purity and child-like innocence of such high concentration that he could be called a retard - depending on your state of mind. Chance is always himself - he never pretends to be something other than a gardener. All he wants is to watch TV and work in a garden taking care of the plants and flowers. Having meals on time would not hurt, either. Whatever happened to Chance only happened because he was there - in the right time in the right place. But was it a right time and place for anybody? Was Chance the answer to the problems the country was going through? Of course, not. I agree with the comments that the society has the rulers it deserves - if we believe that Chance's messages are profound and deep, we very much deserve him as our leader. It is very sad film, I think. It has many hilarious scenes, jokes, and dialogs but it is not a comedy, and not a feel good movie. It is a sublime, intelligent meditation on very serious matters - politics and media and how they relate to each other; the great power of being there and projecting the image the public wants to admire and follow. How easy is it for us to be fooled, especially when we want to be fooled?

Peter Sellers is magnificent. I don't think that anybody else could've done what he did with the character. I also liked a lot Melvyn Douglas' Oscar winning performance as a dying billionaire, the frail and old but the strong and wise man who realizes that the time has come for him to go.",1188432000,4,2041,4.44
349653,5,6301590740,"Peter Sellers' final film role came in 1980's disastrous ""The Fiendish Plot of Fu Manchu,"" but I suspect he would have preferred to be remembered for the previous year's ""Being There,"" for which he earned his second Oscar nomination. The role of Chauncey Gardiner didn't win him that prize (Dustin Hoffman was cited for ""Kramer vs Kramer""), but he was voted best actor by the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (in the musical/comedy category).

 Chauncey, a.k.a. Chance, was the brainchild of Jerzy Kosinski whose novel found a passionate fan in Sellers. At the time of the book's publication, neither Sellers nor the author had the clout necessary to get a film made (Sellers' career was sliding downhill by 1968 and wouldn't recover until 1975's ""The Return of the Pink Panther""), but they promised each other that whoever got ""hot"" first would set the project in motion. By 1979, both had their share of clout and the film was a hit with both critics and the public.

 Chance the gardener is a slow-witted, mildly retarded man who has spent his life in a rich man's house, tending the garden and watching television, his only source of knowledge. When his benefactor dies, Chance is expelled from his Garden of Eden and left to wander the streets of Washington D.C. where he is struck and mildly injured by a limousine belonging to one of the country's most powerful financiers. Guilt stricken, the financier's wife (Shirley Maclaine) takes him home where his innocent words about gardening impress her influential husband (Melvyn Douglas) as brilliant, symbolic pearls of wisdom. Before long, the president of the U.S. (Jack Warden) is quoting the gardener who becomes a media sensation.

 Whether Winston Groom, the author of ""Forrest Gump,"" read Kosinski's novel or saw the film it inspired is unclear, but there are similarities. But ""Being There"" has a darker, more cynical edge, and is the superior film. It lambasts the shallow times in which we live as effectively as Paddy Chayefsky's earlier ""Network,"" but explores it from a different angle and avoids being a shadow of any film that came before. The only debit of this production is the inclusion of the out-takes that run alongside the closing credits. Amusing though they are, they tend to spoil the mood the film so effectively creates.

349656,5,6301590740,"Jerzy Kozinski's brilliant novel is brought to life in a nearly flawless adaptation.  Peter Sellers' finest moment as an actor comes about by his playing a completely blank slate, a man who makes no decisions himself, but rather floats along the river of life, periodically spewing quotes and catchphrases he's gleamed from television, all the while being mistaken for a messianic genius by all who encounter him.

One could argue about what the true meaning of the film is.  Is Chance someone to look up to?  A sort of idiot-savant guru?
Or is he merely a comic foil used to bring to light the foolishness associated with ""cults of personality""?  A disgusting byproduct of a media-saturated culture?

349657,3,6301590740,"Peter Sellers stars as Chance, a learning disabled man who is evicted by lawyers from his landlord's estate after his benefactor dies.  Simple, yet dignified, his only recourse is to leave with nothing but his umbrella and a suitcase with his sparest belongings.  He comes across tough neighborhoods asking people for food and a place to stay with a garden until he has a minor accident where a limousine backs up into his leg.  Passenger Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine) is so taken in by him, she  offers to bring him to a hospital.  Seeming so innocent, she takes him instead to their estate where her husband tycoon, Ben (Melvyn Douglas) is bedridden with a blood disease often associated with children.  Knowing nothing much more than what he sees on television and his own gardening skills, Chance (renamed Chauncey Gardener by his own conversational mishaps) talks about seasons and gardening growth until he meets the President of the United States (Jack Warden) who visits Ben seeking his economic advice.  Once able to impress the President, everyone (including a television audience) thinks they're hearing profound financial advice from an inside man.  In the meantime, Eve becomes infatuated with someone whom she only half knows to rejuvenate her life from her older, sick husband; while the rest of the world tries to figure out the identity of this new, stellar personality.

`Being There' is so sweet it takes off any of the cynical edge of the satire.  Hardly plausible, the actors and script do well enough to suspend our disbelief, nevertheless.  The movie is quirky and innovative for its time.  Afterall, when the world waits to hear each work (literally) uttered from Chance's mouth, we know that they had first dibs before 'Forrest Gump'.

Chance, played by Peter Sellers, is painfully disconnected, not within the narrative but from the narrative. He's a fortunate simpleton. I get it. Tom Hanks got it too in Forrest Gump. The difference is that Forrest is dynamic and likable, Chance is a roulette ball that rolls obliviously for 2 hours and never drops. But the movie is not about Chance. The star turns into the backdrop before which society plays the real fool. That's profoundly ironic, let me tell ya.

349735,4,6301590740,"""Being There"" features one of Peter Sellers' best and final performances as a simple, stupid man who climbs up the political food chain. A movie with an ending that has been the subject of endless discussion for years. The thing that makes Sellers' performance so good is not that it's showy or flamboyant, but that it's quiet. He plays the role the same throughout, with the same speech pattern. Not once does he change his cadence or raise his voice or lower it. He talks like a machine and that's pretty much what his character Chance the Gardener is. Sellers got the role by sending a telegram to the writer of the book (who ended up writing the screenplay), saying he was perfect for it. That's an understatement. I don't think anyone else could play this role. As I said, Sellers plays Chance the Gardener. Chance lives in a big mansion with ""the old man"" and Louise, the maid. All he knows he has learned from T.V. So when the old man dies and Chance is evicted he finds himself on the streets for the first time. He's never left the mansion. The problem is, Chance presents himself like a typical well-to-do man. He dresses in the old man's clothing and his speech sounds intelligent. When he's accidentally hit by a car, he finds himself befriended by a dying millionaire named Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine). When he introduces himself to Eve, he begins choking so when he says ""Chance the Gardender"" she hears ""Chauncey Gardiner."" Pretty soon, Chance finds himself meeting with the President (Jack Warden) and ending up on T.V. By the end of the film, people are thinking about nominating him as a presidential candidate. Chance, despite being stupid and illiterate, responds well to cues which is  how he makes it around these people. His scenes are written perfectly, because you can see how people could be fooled by his demeanor. It's never overplayed. ""Being There"" is considered a classic, but isn't seen by many people anymore. It would be a perfect film, but a couple needless subplots (like the president's impotency) slow it down a bit. Any good actor is capable of giving a great performance, but few performances are capable of getting you to have your eyes glued to the screen. Two examples of these kind that pop into my head are Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast' and Al Pacino in 'Dog Day Afternoon.' Sellers' gives one of those performances, because it's so unlike anything you've seen. The ending is the perfect way to end the film. A lot of people try to explain the scene logically, but no explanation convinces someone else. It's obviously a metaphor, but sometimes the smartest film watchers don't know what it means. A lot of people try to say Chance is standing on something, but doesn't work. The final scene is an image that we're presented with. It's for us to interpret, but, theoretically, we're not allowed to pry deeper into the image we're given. And speaking of images, another thing that makes this film so good is the photography by Caleb Deschanel (whose recent works include 'The Passion of the Christ' & 'Ask the Dust'). All the photography in this film is superb, but there are two examples in this film that wow me. One being the final scene and the other fairly early on when Chance walks down a busy street. ""Being There"" is a satire, when you get right down to it. It's a great film, with some minor flaws. Douglas, Warden, and MacLaine also deliver memorable performances, so I recommend you see this.

That would explain, perhaps, the eerie plausibility of a character who is the ultimate empty suit. Reared in isolation, elegantly dressed in his late benefactor's cast off clothes, well-spoken through lack of exposure to vulgarity, and ignorant of everything except gardening, Chance is at grave risk of starving to death on the mean streets of Washington, DC, until, by blind--umm--chance, he is thrust, uncomprehending, into a world of wealth and power. There his taciturnity is mistaken for gravity and his endless, inappropriate references to gardening as optimistic wisdom in troubled times. The smug self-delusion of the mighty skewered in Ruth Attaway's masterpiece of understated satire is every bit as delightful to watch in 2007 as it was in 1979.

The hallmark of a great movie is its ability to wrap you up in the plot, and suspend your disbelief long enough to make you feel as if what's happening in the movie is reality. Unfortunately, this movie does not accomplish that goal, although it most definitely wants to. The beginning scenes of Chance in the city are certainly realistic, especially his confrontation with the punks, since their reactions are certainly what one would expect. However, from this point on the film goes from cold realism to blissful fantasy without ever giving the viewer a chance to transition between the two. Chance is mistaken for the second coming by the rich elites, when in reality, their reactions to him should've been as apprehensive and suspicious as the punks were. This harsh transition from reality to fantasy is too quick and abrupt to afford any understanding by the viewer, and one is left with the recurrant, nagging feeling of ""oh come on"" throughout the rest of the movie. The film takes a disturbing turn at the end, when Ben is to be entombed in a pyramid with an all seeing eye atop (possibly an Illuminati reference?). Chance, completely oblivious to the machinations of the political puppetmasters (""Is America really a democratic Republic?"" is what's seemingly said here) simply walks away, and on water for that matter, just like he did in the beginning. Unfortunately the ending does nothing to clarify what was happening throughout the movie, and viewers are left with the infamous ""that's it?"" impression. This movie does contain a few humorous scenes, but nothing outright riotous, not even the masturbation scene involving Eve, which just comes across as sad and pathetic. One is tempted to analyze her pyschologically, given the fact that she has a tendency toward unfulfilling romantic relationships.

As the only TV anchor/reporter in the cast, I had a ""leg up"" in getting stories for my newscasts. When the casting director called to tell me to be at the Biltmore House the next morning at 6--""for wardrobe and make-up""--I didn't dare call my bosses at the TV station for fear they wouldn't let me do the movie. I was going to be in this film if it meant quitting my day job. And now, some 27 years later, how glad I am that I am in it, if only in a small speaking role. All I had hoped for was to be chosen to appear an an extra in the funeral scene (they were casting several dozen locals) and wound up cast as a ""day player"" with my own dressing room, for God's sake. The high point for me was doing a TV report on makeup legend Charlie Schram, who had been the head of MGM's make-up department during its golden years, making up the likes of a teen-age Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West in the ""Wizard of OZ"", among actors in many now-classic films.

349741,5,6301590740,"The novel Being There is dark farce. The film Being There is an epiphany of light. As the film proceeds, we settle down quite comfortably into our own stereotypes - We're watching a sweet but dim-witted man innocently get the better of all his betters. Yes, absolutely, that's just what it is. But when the movie reaches its finale, we see with mild shock our perceptions were just as proud, just as superficial, just as wrong as those of the worldly people surrounding the ""dim-witted"" man. We - like they - never realized we were in the presence of spiritual majesty, in the presence of a living miracle. The movie thus holds up a mirror to the viewer.

Some amazon reviewers don't see themselves in this mirror. They don't understand this film for just that reason - they watched it through from beginning to the end with blinders on - and declined to take them off at the finale - even when the blinders were pointed out to them. Some folks apparently want more car chases, light saber battles, or good old-fashioned CGI explosions; others seem to consider the profound ignorance of a dim-wit as capable of producing miracles.

Being There, because of its sweetness and humor and innocence and profundity, is one of my favorite films. It was Peter Sellers' swan song.",1165881600,8,2058,5.079881656804734
349802,5,6301590740,"""Being There"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, starring Peter Sellers in his last major film role.  How Sellers was cheated out of an Oscar is still a mystery to me, as this has to be one of the greatest performances by an actor in the last 40 years.  Maybe voters for the Academy Award weren't in the mood for a black comedy, which this show is, or maybe they didn't like its political overtones?  Or, maybe they just couldn't give such a serious award to someone who'd played Inspector Clouseau?  In any case, this movie was way before its time in style and substance; Academy voters missed the boat.  Among other things, they should have asked themselves if anyone else could have played this part so well?  Could anyone else have done the blank, languid stares so convincingly?  Could anyone else have delivered the dead-pan lines so flawlessly?  The answers would have been a resounding, No.

The movie tells the story of a half-retarded gardener, Chance, whom one supposes is the illegitimate son of a prominent business man in Washington, D. C.  This occurs in 1979, when the Carter Administration was in its last stages of faded glory.  Chance, played by Peter Sellers, is left homeless when the old man dies.  He then wanders the streets of the big city in search of his new life.  Whatever he has learned has come from watching TV and he uses his remote control to change channels.  While roaming the streets of Washington, Chance even tries his clicker in real life situations, which is very funny.

Chance then stumbles upon one of the main power brokers in D. C., a gravely-ill Ben Rand.  He is played by Melvyn Douglas who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this portrayal.  Rand's wife Eve, played by Shirley MacLane, falls for Chance and a tawdry affair (on her side) ensues.  Later on, Chance becomes a media sensation, of sorts, and appears on late-night TV to present his simplistic views.  They're all couched in terms of keeping a garden prosperous which rings a responsive chord with all concerned.  Almost everyone takes Chance for a modern day genius when he really is just the opposite.  Various private and government security agencies do research on Chance's background and can find nothing.  He wears expensive clothes and underwear, dating from the 1930's, that apparently are hand-me-downs from the old man.  It's as if Chance suddenly dropped out of the sky, which he practically has.

At Mr. Rand's funeral, the surviving power brokers talk of making Chance the next U. S. President.  The closing scene shows Chance stepping out onto a lake appearing to walk on water.  Maybe this is to serve as final proof that he deserves the #1 job?  As far as I know, no one has ever explained the significance of the scene which is as it should be.  As with the best art, it's up to the viewer to decide its meaning.

To me the movie shows the power of television and other forms of mass media in shaping the public mind.  Taken to the extreme, a total idiot might be foisted off on the public to hold the highest political office if only he has the right handlers and avoids any whiff of scandal.  The biting sarcasm and irony of ""Being There"" would not appeal to everyone's taste but most thinking adults should be captivated by the story and by Sellers' amazing performance.

Before buying the DVD, I tried to find out either on websites or on the outside of the package, if the hilarious out-takes appear on this recording.  These were superimposed over the closing credits in the original version shown in theaters but often do not appear when the film is shown on TV.

349805,5,6301590740,"A VERY DIFFERENT PETER SELLERS!?

Peter Sellers had for all his professional life on the big screen lived by making excessive characters, sometimes as many as 3 at time, come to life and literally create a universe for us to watch in wonder. ""Being There"" is different, completely different. Here the universe is waiting for Peter Sellers in a rare, less-is-more performance where the theme could rightly be called, ""A Charmed Life."" After all, how else could a seemingly-autistic person take on knife-wielding street-gangsters, political heavyweights, and romance with no more emotion than when he walked on water, stopped to check the depth of the water with his umbrella, and then simply continued.

MY TAKE ON 'BEING THERE' - -

""Being There"" is about the impossible being not only plausible, but completely accepted on face value. Peter Sellers is simply startling as a soft-spoken, well-dressed, gentleman's gardener who knows nothing more about the world than what he sees on TV. He relates to everything as though it were a garden, because that is all he knows on a first-hand basis -- UNTIL NOW! That's where the movie begins, Chance the Gardener's foray into real life. Don't miss it.

'BEING THERE' IS THE DEFINITIVE CHARACTER DRIVEN BLACK COMEDY - -

Call it a black comedy, a cross-over film, a poltical satire, or anything you like. This film simply works as an example of the actors making the film with the help of excellent direction by Hal Ashby and an excellent adapted screenplay by the book's author Jerry Kosinski. Peter Sellers' Oscar-nominated performance was supported by an incredible cast:

This phenomenal film from 1979 is one I had not seen until recently. I can't imagine why or how this one got by me, but I was thrilled to see it now. It is uncomfortable to watch at times, but it is definitely worth viewing.

ABOUT THE DVD: LACKS FEATURES BUT PLAYS VERY WELL!",1159920000,2,2142,4.859504132231405
349806,5,6301590740,"I can see why some people don't like this movie. If the themes don't resonate with you, it's not really strong enough as a story; and, of course, if your comedic horizons end at 'Jackass', you'll find it awfully slow. Personally, I think it's a great movie and Peter Sellers should have won the Oscar for it- the Academy gave the award to Dustin Hoffman for one of his more pedestrian performances, presumably because he had been nominated and lost 3 times previously.

I won't repeat the plotline, it's been dealt with extensively already. One of the strengths of the movie is that it means different things to different people. Here's what it means to me. I see Chance the gardener, aka Chauncey Gardner, as representing life. The film shows how other people perceive him and, sure enough, he is what each person perceives him to be. He's wise, he's philosophical, he's a great lover, he's down to earth, he's politically astute, he's underhanded, he's ambitious...... in reality, he's none of these things. He's a blank canvas on which others paint their pictures- and what they see is different in every case. Only one person sees him as he is, and sensibly keeps quiet about it. The message is that life is how it appears to you- and most people see what they want to see.

Chance is also an individual experiencing life, and in this capacity life becomes what you make of it. Chance, in his state of innocence, doesn't have any preconceptions about his limitations. He simply does what he wants to do or is asked to do. When he's asked questions, he answers in the only way he knows how without wondering what others will think of his answers. When he wants something, he asks for it. Nothing intimidates or scares him. When he's asked to appear on a talk show or to advise the President, he isn't afraid that he will make a fool of himself. In the final, consummate act of innocence, he walks out on the water, simply because he doesn't know he can't. Chance shows what life could be if we were unbounded by convention or fear, things that constrain most of us and limit what we achieve.

The film's messages are brilliantly realized by Hal Ashby, and make this movie one of the few (A Room With A View would be another) which outshine the book from which they are derived. He draws a wonderful performance from Sellers, who is completely convincing as the man/child, and excellent performances from the great supporting cast. If you want belly laughs, the only scene in this movie you'll enjoy is the one with Shirley MacLaine pleasing herself. If you want thoughtful, subtle comedy with a message, try Being There. And don't forget to watch the final credits.",1159401600,5,2668,4.648305084745763
349807,3,6301590740,"As with its title character (Chance the Gardener or ""Chauncey Gardner"" as he's mistakenly called), I found Being There amiable, but slow. The movie did evoke some chuckles from me, but I didn't find myself laughing that hard and it's pace was too slow for my tastes. Granted, it's not a joke-filled movie. The humor comes from the characters, not one-liners. The plot: a men with the mind of a child is left to his own devices after his rich but reclusive caretaker dies. After being accidentally hit by a car belonging to a wealthy woman, he is taken in and soon has access to the rich and famous. Everyone loves Chancey's innocent, simple, good cheer. They mistake his innocent words as great wisdom. The largest problem I had with it was the premise, which I found very hard to believe. Only one person in the movie is on to Chauncey from the beginning, but doesn't say anything so as to not rock the boat. But other events are hard to believe. First of all, would lawyers evict a man from a home even though he is clearly not competent to live on his own? Could a middle-aged man--retarded or not--never have been taken outside the place he lives?  How could there be no paper trail detailing Chancey's existence? Could a ""slow"" person like Chauncey really get access to the president within a day of leaving his home? And would people really seriously consider him for becoming president himself? My answer to these questions is no. But the movie must stretch our disbelief for the sake of its plot and to make a social/political statement about people liking mindless optimism. Unfortunately, the movie says nothing new. It's a cynical belief that the people in power are dumber than those they lead and that politics is about choosing the most inoffensvie candidate possible. There's some truth in these views, but I believe the opposite. I think politicans are shrewd people who are forced to pander and oversimplify in order to get anything done. Some may see this movie as a great statement about how personality matters in politics.

The 2nd time I saw this film, I saw and felt a poignant undercurrent to it.  There's poetry in it, and I'm not so sure that my first impression was correct.  Many saw the film (and still do) as a satire on American stupidity and our adoration of television.  Many compare (even myself) Chance (Peter Sellers's character) to George W. Bush.  It is a false comparison.  While Chance seems to be raised on TV, he also comes across almost as a ""holy fool"" (a term used in Russian literature), a person who is seen by many as an idiot but who is spiritually and morally strong.  Many who watch this film think he's an idiot, but there's something poignant, humanistic, and really childlike about the character, as if maybe he is a little more than just an idiot who made good.  Someone will tell me that I'm falling for Chance's ""folksy wisdom"", but I'm not.  I'm as jaded and as cynical as anyone.  There's a meditative quality about this film, a poetic quality that I don't believe was an accident.  Some have said that Sellers is a Christ like character (especially when he walks on water at the end), and others have said it just shows how stupid Chance is at the end by walking on water.  I don't know.  I found the ending beautiful myself.

Sellers is astoundingly good in his penultimate film here.  Melvyn Doughlas (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) and Shirley MacLaine are excellent as well.  It's really a special film that many may have interpreted incorrectly.  I think people need to see this film again with a different eye.",1156118400,6,1765,4.4937106918239
349809,5,6301590740,"The bad news is, of course, that Peter Sellers died shortly after making this film. The good news is that he finished the film first. I had always believed, since his days in THE PARTY, that Sellers was a highly nuanced actor, with more authority and talent that he was often given credit for, in part due to his love of---and great skill at---farce. BEING THERE is a classic vindication, proving once and for all what a very great acting talent Sellers possessed.

It had been several years since I'd watched the movie. I found a DVD that I'd gotten for Christmas and watched it yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was as good, or perhaps better, than I remembered. Every actor is centered and believable. There is great humor involved and applied most subtly. Sorry if it sounds maudlin but I think a very good adjective might be that the film is ""sweet.""

Peter Sellers was simply brilliant.  The fact that you can believe this character at all is a tribute to the writing and the directing.

349851,4,6301590740,"I'm a big fan of both Peter Sellers and Hal Ashby, so this was a real treat.  Ashby's simple, straightforward filmmaking perfectly backs up a simple, straightforward character played honestly and charismatically by Sellers.  Just like how the characters use Chance as a way of projecting their needs outwards and clearing up their fears, the film is readily willing to allow you to put whatever you want into it, whether it be the nature of simplicity, the effects of television on people, and like themes.

But overall, it's a heartwarming and wonderful parable, something that, despite its sometimes sexual content, is really open for anybody to enjoy (though I don't know, kids or such might be a little bored by the prolonged way it presents its story).

Only because I saw the latter recently, I thought I'd mention that this seems an interesting precursor to a Japanese movie that came out last year named Bin-jip (3-Iron).  Both deal with invisible characters living on the fringe of society who eventually take in all that the other characters give them (kindness in Being There, hatred in Bin-jip) and transcend to another plane of existence.  In Being There, Sellers' transcendence is Biblical, while in Bin-jip the mute is Buddhist.  Both of them are really good movies and make interesting companion pieces, so if you were awed by this movie, you should check out the other one.

Anyway, the key thing I got out of this movie was that Chance, being unable to really communicate the way people expect of him, is unaware that he makes the perfect listener.  His ""I like to watch"" line is taken just as the characters take it: he is meant to provide the necessary objectivity needed in a room so that the characters can subjectively clear out their own anxieties and conscience.  The familiar and warm presence of Sellers works great for this, because he of all people is really comforting to watch in his various roles.

Although seeing it on the big screen made the movie more justice, it remains one of my favorite films of all time. I still haven't read the book it was based on, out of fear of finding flaws in the movie.

The movie is more or less one joke stretched out into 130 minutes, and believe it or not, it really works. The joke is that the simple minded Chance is taken for a genius by those who meet him, simply because he is nicely dressed and says things that they believe to be metaphors and deep words of wisdom. Throughout the movie, and their relationship with Chance, the characterd grow and develop, except for Chance himself that is.

Because of of his naivite, Chance is the least troubled, and the happiest person in the movie. At one point in the movie, another character says that ""Life is a state of mind"". I try to remember this and not worry so much. This film comes closer to changing my view of the world than any other movie I've seen. It's definately a favorite.",1149811200,,1065,4.215686274509804
349853,2,6301590740,"After the Old Man dies, a dim-witted , middle-aged man (Peter Sellers) finds that he must leave the house and enter the world after a lifelong cloistered existence.

 While I respect the opinions of many of my friends who think BEING THERE is a work of genius. Like Dustin Hoffman in `Rainman' and Tom Hanks in `Forrest Gump,' two other movies I'm not that crazy about, Sellers tones it down considerably.  Smartly decked out in dark brown business suit and derby - thirty years out of days, cast offs from the Old Man's attic - Sellers swiftly becomes involved with the rich and powerful when a car driven by an industrialist's chauffeur pins him against another car and injures him.  The old man is dying and the woman invites Chance (Sellers) to her home to be seen by her husband's live-in physician.  Melvyn Douglas plays the dying man, Shirley MacLaine his wife.  While there the old man becomes enraptured by Chance's simple, plant related philosophy.  Even the President (Jack Warden,) an old friend of industrialist Douglas, is impressed.

 I've watched BEING THERE three times since it was released in 1979.  Each time I finished watching it I think, I know, I'm missing something.  I figured maturity would reveal it to me, but now I'm afraid I'll have to wait for my dotage to figure out this ones appeal.  There are some very nice scenes, especially Douglas's last, understated one.  As always MacLaine dances between great and brilliant. I can't even find anything to fault Sellers for - this is as subdued a part as he's ever played.  I'm in the minority on this, but I think the plot is contrived and bends over backwards, finally snapping, to sustain the unsustainable and convince us that a simple-minded gardener could rise so high, so quick and gull so many so completely.  A pretty fantasy, not to every taste.",1145232000,4,1831,4.75

349901,5,6301590740,"While Dr. Strangelove is his best known performance and is arguably the funniest film ever made, Being There is Peter Sellers greatest perfomance.

Based on the Kosinski novel, Sellers stars as Chance the gardener at the estate of ""the old man"" who dies just before the film starts. Forced into the world by the estate lawyers who come to settle the old man's affairs, Chance must learn to live in the world beyond the walls of his garden. A simple man, all he knows about life in the real world is based on what he has seen on television. All Chance's reactions and observations are what he thinks he should be saying based on what characters have said in similar situations. Since he has, basically, the social comprehension of a small boy, he dosn't really understand what he is saying. Through a series of remarkable coincidences (Chances) he comes to the home of one of the most powerful men in the country and is introduced to the President of the United States.

Since Chance dosn't really understand the world he is thrust into, all he can do, again, is respond how he thinks he should. His simple honesty is viewed by those around him as subtle metaphor and his gardening advice becomes the cornerstone of the President's economic policy.

An allegorical tale, this film was Sellers' dream. He had to fight hard to get it made and eventually succeded. A perfectly serious performance, Sellers finally got to do what he always wanted, to be himself, a scared, confused man cught up in a world that dosn't really get him, existing only as an idea in other peoples' minds.

While the book is one of the greatest works of fiction of the twentieth century, Sellers' personal connection to and instant love of this character is truly remarkable and makes for one of the most bittersweet performances any actor has ever given.

It lets us see a bunch of people who think they've got it all under control, but are really just a bunch of baffoons!

Are we to believe that this character really doesn't know any better?  The character as written in the script is simply implausible.  The reactions by the other characters are totally unrealistic, too.  The situations are ridiculous.  That's okay for a screwball comedy, but this film wants to have a serious side.  Unfortunately, gardening metaphors aren't that novel or compelling, and neither is this bore of a movie. I normally like movies about eccentric, perplexing introverts, but this one, though sprinkled with amusing moments, just isn't credible as a story.  I especially loathe the absurdist ending, which has Chauncey performing a supernatural feat.

""Dr. Strangelove"" may have been Sellers' finest film but his work here as Chance the gardener is his most challenging role.  I've seen this film a number of times over the years and the most common perception of Chance is that he is a stupid man.  Upon further viewing I'm not so sure that Chance is unintelligent but a man sheltered from life's harsh realities and forcefed an alternate reality of banal television.  I think Sellers understood this distinction and from that he taps into the pathos of Chance and gains the audience's sympathy.  I used to take a harsh view of Chance's wealthy patron's, the Rands(Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas) as ignorant dupes.  On further review these are lonely people whose high station in life has isolated them from the larger society from all but the sycophants and yes-men.  So what if Chance's banal allusions to gardening is misinterpreted as something profound?  If their interpretation brings joy to their otherwise depressing lives then so be it.  I also do not take as harsh a view of the public at large who like the Rands have also misinterpreted Chance's non-profundities.  From my understanding the intention of author Jerzy Kosinski was to satirize the television generation and that Kosinski was a bit contemptuous of Chance.

This movie is based on the 1970 novel ""Being There"" by Jerzy Kosinski (who also wrote the screenplay for this movie).  It's a movie that probably will not appeal to everyone's taste.

The comedy-drama is about a man named Chance (Peter Sellers), the gardener of a small estate that he has lived and worked on all his life.  (In fact, he has never left the estate because all his needs, even meals, were provided for.)  When the owner (the ""old man"") of the estate dies, the truthful, well groomed, well dressed but illiterate Chance is evicted.

Chance knows only about three things: gardening, watching television, and the environment of the estate where he lived and worked.  That's it!!

By chance, he becomes involved with a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley MacLaine).  The billionaire is also an economic advisor to the US president (Jack Warden).  Everything that Chance says is misinterpreted as profound and ""sage wisdom.""  (Even his name is misinterpreted as ""Chauncey Gardiner."")  The billionaire's wife becomes interested in him romantically.  By the end of the story, Chance is considered to be the next president.

To get an understanding of how Chance or Chauncey is misinterpreted, consider this dialogue between him and a worker at a publishing house.  (Notice that Chance is absolutely truthful in this conversation):

WORKER: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you would consider writing a book for us, something about your political philosophy.  What do you say?
CHANCE: I can't write.
WORKER: Heh, heh, of course not, who can nowadays?  Listen, I have trouble writing a postcard to my children.  Look, we can give you a six-figure advance.  I'll provide you with the very best ghost-writer, proof readers...
CHANCE: I can't read.
WORKER: Of course you can't!  No one has the time!  We glance at things, we watch television...
CHANCE: I like watching TV.
WORKER: Oh, sure you do.  No one reads!

The very ending of this movie has Chance walking on water.  Actually, he's walking on the surface of a lake and he reveals to us that the lake has depth not just a surface.  This ending is open to many interpretations but for me it summarized the entire movie beautifully.

Sellers gives a superb, subtle comic performance.  This was truly the last great movie Sellers made.  All supporting actors (especially MacLaine and Douglas who won an Oscar for his performance) do terrific jobs.

The music is said to be by Johnny Mandel.  I think this means he's just performing it because the main music seems to be that of composer Eric Satie, who wrote beautiful, non-complex music.  The music in this movie adds to each scene.

The only problem I had with this movie was when the end credits rolled.  Comical outtakes are shown.  These are hilarious but I feel that these broke the mood of the movie.

Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality.  Unfortunately, it has minimal extras.

In conclusion, this is a great movie that will probably not appeal to everyone's taste.  In my opinion, this movie serves as a tribute to the comic genius of Peter Sellers!!

The scene at the end with Sellers walking on water is a bit much (it hits us on the head with the obvious, just in case we didn't get the connection), and at 130 minutes the movie is much too long - especially since Sellers walks around in a near catatonic state the whole time. There is much food for thought here, though. Definitely worth a watch.",1126828800,,1118,4.623115577889447

349966,5,6301590740,"I have read the many reviews with interest.  A recurring question is what is the film about?  Many people point out that many characters in the film 'project' qualities onto chance the gardiner - qualites that do not 'really' exist but all qualities are projected and do not exist inherently.  The qualities of the film are projected, they are mere opinion, they are not intrinsic to the film and I think the author of the book/screeplay knew this and has the last laugh for what I believe is the point of the whole film (and here I am projecting too) is summed up in the final words 'Life.....is a state of mind'.  And so it is.

Being There - one of my very favourite films of all time - it's magial and I love it. So few films are so right in all it's parts but this is one and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts - I can watch it again and again.  Magical and priceless.",1126051200,,885,4.146198830409356
349967,5,6301590740,"My wife and I watched ""Being There"" last night and found it to be a wonderful movie! I remember hearing about it when it first came out but I just never got around to watching it.  Recently I was reading Shirley Maclaine's book ""Out On A Limb"" and there were several pages regarding Peter Sellars and some extraordinary spiritual experiences he had shared with her during the filming of this movie. That intrigued me enough to want to watch it.

 The character played by Peter Sellars, ""Chauncey (Chance) Gardiner"", is a man who is more like a child. He can't read or write but learns most of what he knows from watching T.V. He is childlike in the best sense, in the way a Zen master would be. Totally present and innocent.

 Thru strange circumstance he ends up living in a mansion owned by a dying and good hearted industrialist who becomes enamored with  Chauncey's ""realness"" and takes him in. Not only that Chauncey ends up somehow in a position where people from the President of the United States and others are influenced by his innocent wisdom. Shirley Maclaine as the wife of this industrialist also falls under the spell of this innocent Gardiner (without any effort from him).

 This movie is just one that you have to watch to really appreciate it, there's no way I can do justice to this masterpiece in words. It is so well written, acted and produced that you just have to experience it.

 Peter Sellars IS Chauncey Gardiner, he is brilliant. Shirley Maclaine and the rest of the cast are right up there with him, they truly became their characters.

 This movie is very subtle and strange so you have to just flow with it. It's not a one that will hit you over the head, and yet I found it totally compelling and was drawn into it completely.

 Highly recommended!",1124409600,,1781,4.559748427672956
349997,5,6301590740,I think this may be the best film that Peter Sellers ever made.  The satire is wonderful.  I doubt if anyone else could have played the part as well as he did.  His comic genius shines in this movie.,1124150400,,199,4.051282051282051
349998,5,6301590740,"Having recently seen The Life and Death of Peter Sellers starring Geoffrey Rush, I was compelled to see Being There. In the ending of his biopic, they did an reenactment of a scene from Being There in which the maid Louise said goodbye to Chauncy Gardener(Sellers) for the last time. It was  a very touching scene. He's a kind, non-judgemental, compassionate, and loving man. He's lived in the Old Man's house, and worked as the gardener. For the first time he has to embark a life outside the house. He has no real experience of the outside world, and had only seen life on TV.

Chauncy's life is changed completely when he met Eve(Shirley MacLaine) and her wealthy politician husband. His unusually down-to-earthness and fondness for gardening instantly impressed the couple, and they took him to live with them. Eventually, he's introduced to other powerful figures in the political world and managed to inspired the president, as well he attracted the mass media to interview him and go on TV. Chauncy Gardener instantly became a sensation and influence to the citizens who saw his interviews. Meanwhile, Eve was falling in love with Chauncy when her ailing husband was bed-ridden, and encouraged her to go on a date with Chauncy.....

Peter Sellers gave the performance of his career that garnered him an Oscar nomination, and this is a very different role compared to his snapstick comedies. It's an isntant comparison to Forrest Gump, but this film doesn't rely on so much unrealistic fantasy storyline or special effects to make it a captivating expeience. Shirley MacLaine was wonderful together with Sellers in the love scenes.",1117411200,4,1637,4.989010989010989
349999,5,6301590740,"I would rather think of this movie not as dark comedy, though I am sure that would be the correct genre, but as enlightening comedy. ""Life is a state of mind."" So what kind of mind have you? We as the audience are invited in to see ""Chance"" as he is and then observe how everyone interprets him from their own perspective. On a practical level, knowing estimates of the mentally ill in my state range around 25%, it suggests how we may wrongly interpret those around us by universalizing our sense of everything and presupposing it is the sense of others too - without ever really finding out what they understand and how they intend what they say. It is clear to me from observing mentally ill people in conversation with those that do not understand the mental illness of the person they are speaking to just how accurately the movie depicts the results. In this sense, the movie is a training film for those who would work with the mentally ill and that should cover everyone! On another level the movie points out that as we see the world so it is. Life is a state of mind. But you can change your state of mind. When you change your state of mind you change your world. As invited guests into the mind of ""Chance"" we are offered the opportunity to elevate our mind to another level of perception. This level enables us to perceive the perspective of others and remove us from the box that was our own previous limit. This is a great teaching device for those who are attempting to show this to someone who is not aware of the technique - having never done it before. The movie shows them they can do it and should.
Further, the movie is commentary and suggestion. I fail to see that the interpretation is forced. Interpret the last scene as you will - it still drives home the thesis just blatantly depicted on the Rand Memorial ""Life is a state of mind"" also repeated for emphasis by the presidential remarks. The movie leaves it up to the viewer to interpret the depth of this thesis.
This is a great movie and very useful.",1114905600,4,2030,4.401595744680851
350000,5,6301590740,"""Being There"" (1979) remains one of the all-time great films, with a brilliant portrayal by Peter Sellers that should have won an Academy Award. Director Hal Ashby has done justice to Jerzy Kosinski's perceptive satire on the media age  dominated by Sellers' unique performance as the simple-minded gardener Chance. Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas lend excellent support to Sellers' finest screen role. In retrospect, ""Forrest Gump"" is a pale imitation of this timeless classic.",1114646400,4,482,5.513513513513513
350001,5,6301590740,"In an age where we are seemingly governed by what flickers on the idiot box (reality tv anyone?) this movie is sadly still extremely relevant today.  So what if everything you know was learned through watching television; what kind of person would you be?  That is the lure of Being There (although by no means is it the entire movie).  Peter Sellers (in a performance proving yet again how invalid the Academy Awards are in judging the ""best"" of anything) plays ""Chance"", a quiet gardener put out of work and home when his elderly employer dies.  Not really all that harrowing until you realize ""Chance"" has no understanding of a world without commercial interruption or the convenience of changing the channel with a remote control.

The ability of mankind to see and hear what it wants is definitely the underlying theme to this film.  When befriended by an ailing millionaire with extreme political influence ""Chance's"" every word is viewed by the media (and subsequently the world) as that of a philosophical genius.  Everything ""Chance"" says is relevant to gardening which gives him the appearance of being steadfast in his philosophy.

It's very rare that a movie comes along with such amazing acting, writing, and direction.  Peter Sellers gives the performance of a lifetime and I can't imagine anyone else ever playing ""Chance"" with more conviction or nuanced aplomb.

The script is amazing, providing a thought provoking introspection of our own assumptions of the everyday.  The ending of this film is one of the best I've ever seen, as it makes you rethink every interaction and smile, because it all makes sense.

Being There is a must see film for anyone who is fed up with the vice grip television has on the world mindset and how we are more often than not misinformed and deluded with it's freely provided misconceptions.

350003,4,6301590740,"If ""Dr. Strangelove"" was a Peter Sellers showcase for his wide-ranging talents as both an actor and comedian, then his performance in ""Being There"" is a magnificent contrast of reserved genius.  The rest of the cast in this film ranges from good to passable, but Peter Sellers is the reason to own this strangely captivating film.  He plays a feeble-minded gardener whose only experience in the outside world has been through watching hours of television.  His elderly guardian dies and he is then cast out into the ""real"" world with only his clothing, his umbrella and hat...and his channel-changer.  He begins a surreal journey that eventually leads him to another wealthy, elderly gentleman who eventually considers Chauncy Gardner (Peter Sellers) a good friend and confidant.  This wealthy gentleman has links to the Presidency, as well, and what follows is pure political satire.  Chauncy is considered a thoughtful political analyst, often unwittingly comparing the government to a garden in wintertime, and is thereby thrust into the limelight as a potential candidate for the Presidency.  The satire is intelligent and well-written, Peter Sellers carrying the film with an under-stated performance that garnered him yet another Oscar-nomination.  It is remarkable how many different characters Peter Sellers has portrayed.  His work in ""Being There"" is superb and the political satire laced throughout the script is dead-on.  The final scene is one of those moments that makes you re-evaluate everything you just saw; that perhaps ""life is a state of mind"" after all.  Recommended.",1107216000,6,1589,5.341365461847389

That there is season and a purpose under heaven, and no matter how hard and complicated we try to make things around us, basically, it is very simple. Peter Sellers, as ""Chauncy"", is often described as dimwitted and retarded.  However, I disagree, he is merely reflecting how seeing things in respect to one's expercience in life, we can draw our own answers. The other characters in the movie merely expand on his point of view, drawing their own answers as well. The billionaire, the President, the Ambassdor of Russia, men of great education, power and knowledge, however, so caught up in their own inherent selfish interest. They fail to realize how things could be resolved by just showing a genuine interest in your fellow human being. Basic things in live: food , shelter and a sense of purpose.

This is a different kind of comedy than the standard Hollywood fare.  It is really best described as a satire, and it would make an excellent double feature with Chayefsky's ""Network"", which, like ""Being There"", seems even more relevant and prophetic now than it did in the time of it's initial release.

350006,5,6301590740,"Seeing this film for the first time, 25 years on from its original release, two things really hit home. Firstly it's very good - the acting and direction are excellent, it's funny, it's a clever story, and it makes you think. All pretty good credentials for any film. Secondly - and here's where its true brilliance lies - its underlying message hasn't dated at all and, if anything, is more relevant and effective than it was when it was made.

And the message itself? Superficially, it's an exploration of how, in a world dominated by the fleeting demands of mass media, someone with absolutely no knowledge at all can become a megastar and, once established as such, can demand respect and gain power far beyond their capabilities. And, beneath that... well, that's where the fun starts. Is it an exploration of the shallowness of western society? Is it a study of people's weaknesses & needs? Is it a religious allegory? Is it, in terms of most of the characters, a huge tragedy? Is it all or none of these?

The ending, which generates much debate about its ""meaning"" - is he walking on water in a messianic way or is he simply so stupid that he doesn't realise he's walking, by accident, on a submerged jetty? - is quite brilliant as are the final ""over the titles"" cuts of Sellers being unable to deliver his deadpan lines without laughing at them, leaving you with the uncomfortable feeling that the ""joke"" might be on you in trying to read too much into what's on offer here. In the end, of course, it's what you want it to be and that's the whole point of the story - we make people, situations and films themselves into what we want them to be not what they necessarily are.

His imitation of hand motions, the lack of empthy or emotion... etc. Autism (at least semi functional autism) to me is not lack of intelligence but freedom from those things that impair us. Chance was so simple in a perfect kind of way. His garden and his tv were enought to satisfy him. He made no judgement of anyone around him either. The ending to me, showed him as I've always imagined god to be. Uncomplicated and bereft of those emotions which set us against one another.",1104278400,6,784,4.489510489510489

For the first time, Seller really seems to reveal his true nature on screen, ironically by portraying a man who really WASN'T all there emotionally, closely parallelling Seller's own personality (see the recent HBO movie about him,The Life and Times of Peter Sellers, to get a more detailed look at Sellers' life and personality) in so many ways.

  The basic premise of the movie is simple - a gardener has been kept secluded from the world, exposed only to television. As a result, his view of things is rather flat, not fully fleshed out. His personality is equally flat but also serene and straightforward. When he encounters the outside world, his simplicity is seen as wisdom and Sellers makes this odd scenario...well, believable.

  This movie was made during a particularly turbulent period in Seller's personal life and yet he manages to be serene, even placid, on film, giving no hint at the emotional turmoil in his offscreen life. Just as Sellers defied categorization (he is, after all, the same actor who made The Pink Panther movies with Blake Edwards as well as Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, this movie is in a class all its own.

350072,5,6301590740,"When I first saw Being There I was all of 10 years old, and for some reason, I loved it. And yet I could never exactly say why. Several years latter while looking for another movie, I happen accross this video and read the review. Chance Gardner played charmingly by Peter Sellers, ( I think that is what the revierwer wrote) stumbles his way into the upcrest where he is mistaken for someone with deep knowledge of the world. Other reviews point out this movie is cynical characterization of self absorbed people in politics and media. As a kid I didn't get that, and now on further reflection what I liked about this movie was how these people where drawn to Chances innocense. In some ways Forrest Gump tried to attempt to tell this story line, but only manages to rehash old sterotypes. Being There depicts in clever, but through real characters whose veil of politness covers a cynasim they have of their world and their own power. But for a kid and maybe why it has a cult following is because the heart of the show, whats addicting about is no matter how self absorbed we become, our best nature is drawn to a simple life, absent of complications. After watching the movie again, the dark comedy is more apparent, but I am happy to say that in the ""Life and death of Peter Sellers"",  Sellers himself interpreted the character as I thought of it when I was kid. Gardner is a man who is sublimely content with no past and no future, and therefore no worries. As a kid I kind of new that as innocense.

350074,5,6301590740,"Freud said, ""Go ask the poets."" We can learn many lessons from art, music, stories, and film. This brings me to ""Being there,"" a novel written by Jerzy Kosinski. The book was first published in 1970. In 1979, the film was released based on the screenplay that was co-written by Kosinski and Robert C. Jones. In keeping with a postmodern perspective, I am willing to entertain multiple interpretations of this story. But I cannot help but think that despite the many potential understandings about this work, there is a most important lesson to be learned.

So, what is the lesson to be learned from Being there? How did a simple-minded gardener--""dumb as a jackass"" according to his maid Louise--become Chauncey Gardiner? The heir to a billionaire's fortune. A media guru. An advisor to the president of the United States. A potential presidential candidate himself. Maybe even a prophet. Was there something innately great about Chauncey? Maybe. But probably not. Being there begs the question, ""Being where?""

Being there is about three things: location, location--and location! Chauncey Gardiner, upon getting hit by the Rand's car, was in the right place at the right time. But the lesson goes beyond a mere bump on the leg by a billionaire's fender. Chauncey Gardiner's greatness lied not in the man but, rather, in the relationships of people who chose to define him as great. Simply put, Chauncey Gardiner was a socially constructed reality.

These elite (who represent not actually the government of the United States, but the hidden government behind all governments) have obvious plans to use this simple gardener to advance their own agenda for the world. If you notice the symbols at the end of the movie, you will realize that behind the comedy, there is something sinister about this secret government and their plans for the man they are going to create out of the simple gardener. And yet, maybe this simple gardener has greater powers than anyone actually realizes including himself?

350076,5,6301590740,"""Being There"" plays against almost every type imaginable for American film comedy.  Granted.  Off-putting, even, for some.  Check some of the reviews posted here for proof of that.  No, these are not Keystone Kops visual gags; and neither is this a comedy in which the central character is the kind of dimwad one instantly grasps in totality as one would in any Bill & Ted, Ashton Kutcher, or Chris Farley farce.  One might suggest that the only parallel to Sellers' demure performance is that of Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump.""  But that's not correct.  Where ""Gump"" is a cheezy, high-budget form of sappy audience manipulation, ""Being There"" is a gorgeous, pure form of allegory.

The corrolary in American film comedy is, precisely, Buster Keaton, the eternal but average-guy stoicist who responds to events and rarely initiates them.

Sellers was robbed of the Academy Award for ""Being There"" he rightly deserved because it was surmised that the title explained how he played the role - in other words, he merely phoned it in, being by then too impaired to perform physical comedy.

But part of physical comedy is the discipline of restraint.  Someone has to play the straight man in comedies of manners, or the shortcomings of those around him won't come to light.  Imagine the discipline of restraint involved in playing Chance the Gardener from an actor who had been known for his physical comedy, and secondly for his history as a love 'em and leave 'em ladies man.

The story is now known of how Sellers wrote to Jerzy Kozinski as soon as he heard he intended to bring his short story to the screen, how he signed that note ""Chance,"" and how that cemented Sellers' participation in the film.  This is far from a film in which a physical comedian phones in a sleeper part; to the contrary, this was perhaps the most subtle and sophisticated American film comedy since Paddy Chayefsky's landmark film ""Network"" of 1976.  The closing visual gag, for example, is treated as an absolute throwaway - if you blink, you miss it.

The film has come to be shown with two endings: the one with video clips, and the one with hysterical Sellers outtakes.  The outtakes show Sellers' passion while making the film, and reveal that in no way was he diminished of comedic faculties, and has become as important as the theatrical ending in its own way.

Now here's the theory: Is it possible that Sellers, best known in the United States for the farcical (and sometimes vastly overblown) comedies of Blake Edwards but better remembered overseas for his monumental work with The Goon Show and Stanley Kubrick, was perhaps ill used by Edwards in a bunch of comparatively simple-minded comedies which belied the full range of Sellers' potential?  Did Edwards typecast Sellers which to some extent forced him into a string of dreadful ""ethnic"" role comedies like ""The Bobo""?

To me, the logical line of Sellers' brilliance goes through The Goon Show to Kubrick to ""Being There,"" bypassing Edwards' comedies almost entirely, even as noteworthy as some of those were.  Try Sellers' three (it would have been four but for a broken leg) roles in ""Dr. Strangelove"" and his turn in ""Lolita,"" including his drop-dead hysterical improvized ""normal girl"" rant.  That rant stops traffic over forty years later, and Sellers never stops leaning against a railing the entire time.  This then is a glimpse Sellers' gleeful deviousness as a comedian: setting all the other actors in the scene with him off balance.  He could do this with a word, or just a look, just as ably as he could do it with a physical reaction.  I think this is really lost on viewers who consider Sellers as a comedian only in broad strokes, and much of this comes from Sellers' work not only in Edwards' films but in a number of productions from the 1960s including ""After The Fox,"" ""I Love You Alice B. Toklas,"" ""What's New Pussycat"" and ""The Wrong Box.""

There's a disturbing parallel between Sellers' Chance the Gardener and the alleged Presidency of George W. Bush, and a national media falling all over itself to read brilliance into the quizzical mutterings of a simpleton.  Will he be exposed or will the aura of prophet-like adoration continue to fall at his feet?  Ultimately it doesn't matter - the die is self-casting.  That's Kozinski's and Ashby's point, and why ""Being There"" has to be considered entirely on its own terms rather than as a comedy with the comedy missing.  The comedy isn't missing at all, but if you miss it, it's because you failed to see your own role in it.",1093305600,9,4537,4.779487179487179

Chance hasn't much to say (remember, he's never gone to school and only likes to watch tv). However, he's an astute observer and listener, and when he responds with a smile and nod of his head and utters ""I understand"" to his conversation partner, who might be the American President, the Soviet Ambassador or a tv host, people think he's a genius. Preposterous? Try listening closely to the next person you talk to, nod and say ""I understand"" and watch them thank you for really understand them and knowing how they feel. As a musician, I really appreciate the score by Johnny Mandel (who wrote ""The Shadow of your Smile"" that Sinatra made famous and also the theme to MASH). It's a dark and comedic score puctuated with some Erik Satie pieces mixed in) that perfectly complements the movie.

 The acting of Peter Sellars, Shirley McClain & Melvin Douglas is so perfect both as individuals and as an esemble. Melvin Douglas won nod for Best supporting actor and Peter Sellars (Best Actor) and Shirley McClain (Best Actress) were nominated but did not win (a big slight I think considering Sellars brilliant, subtle and unique performance). As someone else suggested, make sure to watch through the end credits to see a few outtakes that are a surprise).

 A few notable facts; Peter Sellars was dying of stomach cancer when he made this movie (he died a year later). The house belonging to Benjamin Rand is the Biltmore House in Asheville, NC. By all means, please rent or buy this movie and enjoy it! Like a rare wine or cigar, this movie is meant to be savored and seen on those special days.",1090627200,4,2557,4.608791208791208

350120,5,6301590740,"This film is like none I have ever seen before.  In the past, when I thought of Peter Sellers (who plays lead character ""Chance the Gardener""), my mind automatically went to Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther series.  I thought of the bumbling, clumsy and silly detective in hot persuit of the pink panther jewel.  What a terrific change of pace!  I really got a sense of Peter Sellers' depth as an actor in this brilliant film.  Sellers, Melvyn Douglas, and Shirley Maclaine were all strong leads in this story, along with a great supporting cast.
BEING THERE tells the story of Chance, the Gardener, a simple man who spends his entire life gardening in the backyard of his boss' house, until one day the old man passes away.  When a couple of journalists come around to find out more about the former master of the house, Chance is the only one there.  The house must close, and for the first time the man must make strides into the big, wide world.  This world is like nothing he could have ever imagined outside of the house where he worked.  One thing that keeps him tranquil and holds his attention is the television.  As Chance says, ""I like to watch.""  (this line is misinterpreted a few times during the course of the movie.) By chance, Chance meets up with Shirley Maclaine the wife of an elderly billionaire.  This is just the beginning of an intriguing series of events where Chance--renamed Chauncey Gardner--the simple man who speaks of plants and their growth (the only real knowledge he has about the world) becomes central as wise sage in one of the most intriguing political ventures.
This film has moments of laugh-out-loud comedy, and serious elements as well.  (The final scene is chilling.....that is all I am going to say......)
Check it out if you are in the mood for something completely different.  In the words of Chauncy, this is definitely a film ""I like to watch.""",1085961600,10,1900,4.666666666666667

It shares much in common with ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" (1837), except there is no Honest Boy to point out that Chauncy Gardner is not whom he is assumed to be. Actually, Jerzy Kosinski wrote the novel on which this film is based and it was skillfully directed by Hal Ashby. The acting throughout the cast is outstanding. Douglas received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role, Sellers a nomination for best actor in a  leading role. MacLaine is also terrific. Obviously, Eve is devoted to her husband as well as very fond of him but starved for attention and affection when Chauncy appears in her life. She is attracted to him just as everyone else is. (I have already noted that this is a fable.) I should point out, now, that at no time and in no way does Chauncy consciously and deliberately attempt to deceive anyone. Yes, he really is THAT dim. If contrasted with him, Forrest Gump would seem like Gore Vidal. Credit Ashby and Sellers for establishing and then sustaining precisely the right tone. The satire has an edge throughout the film but is nicely balanced with gentle humor and tender moments. As someone immortal once said, ""All's well that ends well.""

His name is Chance, but Shirley mistakenly mistakes if for Chauncy, hence the name, Chauncy Gardener becomes this man's own. No one seems to realize the man is a simple minded child, and he even gets to meet the President of the United States and go on a TV show. It is obvious to the most casual observer that ""Chauncy"" is simple minded, probably even retarded, but not obvious to anyone in the film.

350126,5,6301590740,"Being There is the story of Chance (Peter Sellers), a slightly retarded man who has been gardener all his life, and is only interested in television. When the house owner dies, Chance is forced to go out in the real world. One freak accident involving a television later, he enters the life of the Rand family. His dress and demeanour makes everyone believe him a patron of industry, and soon his mundane and rote gardening pronouncements are revered as profound statements.
Being There is the story of a cypher who becomes popular because he appears to be powerful, and not despite but rather because of his pronouncements (such as ""I like to watch TV"", perhaps the most wildly interpreted of Chance's statement in the entire movie). As such, it is mostly reactive : everyone bounces on Chance, his appearance and his pronouncements.
There are many scenes to talk about : although it rarely deviates from its main theme (the wish-fulfillment of people who interpret banalities as profound, both politically and socially), this movie is very interesting philosophically. For instance, Also Sprach Zarathustra with modern rythms superimposed on it plays throughout Chance's first forays in the ""real world"". Chance tries to ""turn off"" a gang member with his remote control, or enters a car for the first time. But the story doesn't dwell too much on Chance's inexperience : he doesn't know how things are supposed to feel, but he does know things from television.
Being There is suppored by Peter Sellers' performance. It's not a hard role, but he plays it perfectly. The movie is about interpretation of the mundane and the limits of semantics, about our limited views of the world, and has often been interpreted as a shot against politics and ""a thinking man's Forrest Gump"".
Interestingly, one review I read compared Chance to the Buddha - he certainly sees the world through ""new eyes"", and is perfectly at peace with himself. He is incapable of thinking far beyond what he can perceive, like most people, but that is due to his retardation, not his will - in that sense at least he has an excuse ! Indeed, it seems a strong analogy between Chance and the people around you can be drawn as well, and that is because Chance's retardation is shown clearly enough that it can withstand very interesting analogies. Should we consider mindlessness as a mental problem ?
The story doesn't make everything tidy (for one thing, it doesn't clearly explains Chance's early life or his mental problem), and in that respect it provokes reflection in more than one aspect. Movies shouldn't explain everything or tie loose ends : that's boring. Being There is not only intellectually satisfying and interesting, but it's also not boring.

I don't think it should be billed as a comedy though.  I found it to be a sheer work of art.  I have never witnessed anything like it before.  There were a scenes that were humerous but not laugh till I fall out of the chair funny.  This movie truly shows what a GREAT actor Peter Sellers truly was.

350159,5,6301590740,"`Being There', starring Peter Sellers in perhaps the best performance of his life (he was nominated for the Academy Award for this), and adapted from Jerzy Kosinski's brief but rich novella, is one of the great, under-rated films that fill video-store shelves, rarely to be rented or purchased, but holding great rewards for those who do.
Perhaps it was in thinking of `The Tao of Pooh' and `The Te of Piglet' that the image of Chauncey Gardiner (Chance, the Gardener) came to mind, as someone who is as close to pure being and a human being can be. Unspoilt by intellect, education, or experience of society, Chance the Gardener has been raised in a protective environment where he main concern is for plants, other living things coming close to simple being, and for a mindless attentiveness to the television that washes over him like a halo, providing him with sufficient information to make others around him believe he is wise and knowledgeable.
In the film we come upon Chance as 'the old man' has died, and the lawyers are coming in to close the house. As a man apart from society, there is no record of Chance even existing (which becomes important later). He is a mystery from the beginning, made all the more mysterious by his completely innocent, non-evasive manner. This is rare for Washington, D.C.!
Having been turned out of the house, Chance begins his partial discovery of the real world. He experiences hatred, deprivation, and solitude for the first time, but all of this leaves little impact upon him. He continues his solitary journey until stopped by a store display of television sets, at which time he backs up to watch himself being displayed from the video camera, and is injured by a passing car belonging to Benjamin Rand, wealthy financier and kingmaker. Mrs. Rand is in the car (played astutely by Shirley MacLaine), and insists on taking Chance (who, while taking his first alcoholic drink, garbles the words to the degree that she mishears his name, becomes at this point Chauncey) back to the Rand estate, where doctors and nurses are in attendance at the sick-near-dying bed of her husband Benjamin.
Chauncey floats effortlessly through this world. Without apprehension and without an image to protect and project, he is simply himself, and in so being, becomes a mirror to project the hopes of those around him. While he speaks in terms of gardening almost exclusively, others, from Mrs. Rand to the President of the United States (who ends up quoting him in a speech) believe he is a master of metaphor, and, much like a mystical text, are quick to assign their own meanings to his words.
Because Chauncey is without affectation, well-mannered and, above all, a curious listener, people are charmed by him. The policeman outside the White House respond when he reports a sick tree in the park. The Russian ambassador responds when Chauncey laughs at his Russian jokes. The Rands respond because they both need, above all, hope. Chauncey becomes a cipher for all.
Chance is a mystery. The President quotes him in a speech, after meeting him at the Rand estate. But who is he? The CIA and the FBI cannot find any information on him. Thus, both decide he must be an ex-agent who has 'wiped the slate clean'.
Ultimately, it is unclear, purposefully so, if Chance is in fact mentally deficient or spiritually enhanced. The disturbing message of the film and novel is that even a little learning can be a soul-destroying force; ignorance is bliss, and enables one to walk on water when one doesn't know one can't.
Will Chance succeed, by Chance? Will the Randian consortium in fact propel him into the Presidency? Would you, the viewer, want him as President?
Filmed largely at the Biltmore Estate (pictured as if it were in the centre of the District of Columbia), this is a visually interesting film as well as an intriguing story, with superb acting performances and an ambiguous moral at the end. The very last words of the film are
`Life is a state of mind.'

350160,5,6301590740,"Part Forrest Gump and part Life of Brian, part the fable of The Emperor Has No Clothes and part parody of the story of Christ, Being There leaves a lot of room for meaning in a simple, artful, and seamless script. And the acting is suburb: I consider it to be on par with Dr. Strangelove as Peter Sellers' finest film.
Being There is a must-see for anyone who appreciates comic subtlety and dark humor.
My favorite interpretation of the film is that of Mr. Sellers' character -- Chance the gardener, or, later, Chauncey Gardiner -- as a Christ-like figure. The film's magnificent ending supports that take, and subsequent viewings reveal more evidence earlier in the motion picture of Chance as a reluctant savior, an increasingly in vogue interpretation of the Biblical Christ.
From a different view, I guess it's a stretch as a political metaphor. After all, who would believe that such a simple man with such a limited vocabulary and an inability to grasp even moderately complex issues could find a place in the public's political consciousness? Heh heh.
But I think Mr. Sellers, who is best known as the bumbling and hapless Jacques Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, would warn against taking his work too seriously. Maybe it's best to take the film as it is: a simple and understated story made great by one of the 20th century's acting geniuses.
Regarding the DVD, the film quality is fine but the overall package is a little short on extras. I know that few DVDs of films more than 20 years old carry things like behind-the-scenes filming or director's commentary, but it would have been nice for the producers of the DVD to do a little more to take advantage of the medium besides including the original trailer.

What makes this film so hilarious is its' dialogue and timing. These elements make the story work, as Sellers character moves from obscurity to celebrity.
Peter Sellers gives one of his finest performances as the timid idiot Chance (as opposed to the confident idiot, Clouseau). The misunderstandings that propel Sellers' character to fame are as clever as they are funny. He is better here than in the Pink Panther films. PP films deliver good slapstick, though sometimes predictable. This films humor is far more subtle and less predictable- making this film all the more funny. His ability to seem so simple to the audience, yet also seem profound to other characters makes all the jokes work. Shirley McClain delivers a solid performance as well.

I'm still scractching my head as to why this movie was/is characterized as 'dark comedy'. There are comedic moments, but like many great dramas, this is a film that may stay with you for days after viewing it. I won't go into plot details, as you can read other reviews for this, but it's an overall gorgeous look at a simple man who has been sheltered from the real world for so long that all he can relate to, and relate to others, is what he has seen on TV. The comedic mishaps that result, and the profound statements he makes to the rest of the jaded world (especially in Washington, DC, where the film takes place) are completely unknown to his character. Shirley MacLaine is wonderful in her role as the wife of the bigwig businessman that takes him in, her interplay with Sellers makes both characters take on whole other levels, each adding to the other.
The cinematography and film score really complete the mood, and the ending scene, with Sellers walking off into the water, umbrella (earlier a cane) in hand, it seems an ode to Chaplin as 'The Little Tramp', his signature striding off into the distance, with only our imaginations to help us wonder what will happen to this sad, singular fellow.
Brilliant...understated, subdued, and yet with enough emotional force to really make you think about all the subtexts it carries, like the meaning of life, death, truth, and character.

350182,5,6301590740,"According to his biography, Peter Sellers had dreamed of playing the roll of Chance Gardner as far back as the early '70s, and would actually go around pretending to be him for years and years, gradually refining the role... by the time the film was shot, he was almost devestated when he was told he was too old, fortunately, however, the director came around to his way of thinking, and hence the realization of a novel with a character perhaps only a genius like Sellers could play - - Sellers portrays an emotionless dimwit savant gardner who grew up isolated on an estate without having ever seen the outside world beyond the garden he tended to and the images on TV with which he has a strange obsession with (he walks around with a remote control, turns on every TV he sees and mimics whatever he sees while watching with his face devoid of expression or emotion.)  - - When his wealthy benefactor dies, he is set out into the world for the first time at middle age.  Immaculately dressed in an expensive suit, umbrella and bowler hat, he wanders through the ghettoes of Washington D.C., his first views and strange encounter with the real world accompanied by the famous disco/funk version of Thus Spake Zarathrustrata (the theme from 2001 : A Space Odyssey.)  It becomes clear that he is convinced that he has actually stepped into the TV and has no ability survive in the absence of the maid who fed and cared for him all his life.  By happenstance, however, he winds up in the estate of a wealthy dying billionaire where his silence and simple minded utterences about ""the garden"", ""seasons"" and ""growth"" are believed to have deep meaning beyond their simplistic intentions.  A powerful black comedy, he serves as a reassuring mirror to the vain and powerful people who come to surround him as theyread their own interparatations into his simple utterences.  He comes to be mistaken as a deep thinking genius among the ruling elite in Washington, and eventually rises to the highest levels of power, even offering advice to the President - - in reality, though, he is seeking nothing more than to find a garden to work in.
Though the film does not feature Seller's trademark madcap slapstick, it is clearly one of his best films.  Seller's does do some interesting physical routines (imitating in gesture whatever he sees on any TV set within vision even in the course of serious conversation), but in contrast to his other films, rather than creating madness and chaos in the world around them, the idiocy of his character is simply overlooked - - a metaphor of the blindness and stupidity of the powerful people surrounding him who are only capable of seeing what they want to see.
All in all, if you're looking for Dr. Strangelove or Inspector Clouseau, you'll probably be let down (as many of the critics were when the film came out), however, if you're looking to see a brilliantly acted, brilliantly written and brilliantly directed cinematic masterpiece with a deep message, this will definitely be a film to remember.

The film is an indictment on how people believe only what they want to hear, how we all behave like sheep and jump on bandwagons and mindlessly follow trends. The film is a harsh comment on the overwhelming power of TV in our lives, especially politics. (Chauncey is certainly mesmerized by TV). We can make heroes out of idiots! Are we all fools, duped into following certain people because they arrive at the right time when we are feeling particularly empty?
The ending is very controversial.  Possibly, a very subtle attack on religion and its leaders. It took many days to sink in...reading the book to gain more insight. Then I read an interview by the author (who played a bit role as a Russian revolutionary in REDS.) What famous person in history walked on water? Is the author saying that Chauncey Gardner is analogous to Christ, or any religious leader? Is he saying Christ was an idiot and people were ripe to follow?
Politics and controversy aside, it is a brilliant performance by Sellers. One scene in particular stands out, when Chauncey, set out on the streets for the first time, defends himself with a remote control! Priceless, just priceless!",1028505600,5,1317,4.751091703056769

He makes no attempt to adjust their ""reality"", he just affirms what they expose to him, and that's all they need to feel understood.  He dresses like a gentleman and that's how people respond to him.
This movie is a fable, because of it's fantastical ending, and also because it taps into the early 70's ""Be here now!"" consciousness.  The moral is, accept and respond directly to the world around you, and you'll go far!

Instead, what you'll find is an elaborate, satirical, postmodern fairy tale that operates under the following premise: The kind, naive, half-wit played by Peter Sellers is so completely out of contact with reality that all he can do is repeat what he's seen on TV. Yet his pronouncements, as vague and infantile as they are, produce sound-bites and are vapid enough to allow his admirers (just about everyone admires him!) to project whatever meaning they want to, so that he is considered some sort of genius, even a Christ figure. To further my point, I am reminded of the cartoon Mr. McGoo where the blind McGoo avoids accident after accident by sheer luck. Peter Sellers avoids verbal accident after verbal accident by the sheer luck of people misinterpreting everything he says so that he comes off as a genius. If that premise sounds funny to you for 130 minutes, you'll like this movie.

without these qualities wind up looking like fools or the

can misinterpret remarks. Chances remarks do make sense and
are intelligent if looked at deeper and his remarks and behavior
not only become inspiring, but are benifical to others. If it was
an ""Emperors new clothes"" story, Chance's remarks would have been revealed as nothing or leading to disaster and they are seen as the opposite.

Yes, I would agree with some former reviewers here, that it's slow of pace - but there is no other way, such a complex, deep and thought provoking film could have been made!
Sellers pleaded for almost a decade to play this part, ...and it is a crime and a display of ridiculous incompetence, possibly bias, by the Academy Awards organisation that Peter Sellers did not win the Oscar for Best Actor in 1980 for this role - ...I believe that went to Dustin Hoffman for Kramer vs Kramer, enough said!!
During the film, a fairly lengthy one at that, Sellers could have so easily broken the spell that was his character ""Chance"" the gardener - he never did!
He is utterly, utterly, compelling and simply superb during the entire portrayal, ...indeed the part of the film when the aged and dying Billionaire, played by the excellent Melvyn Douglas passes away, is one of the most memorable in cinematic history -...as the apparent, seemingly non-understanding Chance, chokes with emotion with the passing of his admiring benefactor.
The film's end, with Sellers walking on the water, offers several interpretations - certainly friends I have known that have watched this film, have differing opinions to it's true meaning -  and perhaps that was always intentional, & therefore significant to it's charm?

They sure were not in any of the audiences I was with, as everyone with me was absolutely broken up laughing.  So many of the people involved in ""Being There"" have been dead for awhile, including Peter Sellers, the star, Melvyn Douglas, the costar, Hal Ashby, the director, and I believe the writer as well.  For every single one of these people, ""Being There"" stands as one of their final works and also their best.

But the key was Peter Sellers, who was wildly uneven in his total body of work but 100% ""on"" for this movie. That he had to play it straight for virtually the entire movie too is further credit to his ample comedic talents.  Outtakes shown at film's end include his breaking into laughter while delivering some of his memorable lines, which ruined those takes. So even he wasn't immune from the comedy of his character, Chauncy Gardener.  The reality of casting though was that there wasn't anyone but Sellers capable of playing this role whereas the other roles could have been cast with others.

Chauncy Gardener takes his name from his sole occupation during life, tending a garden in a Washington DC home for a man who sheltered him all of his life because he was mentally slow or ""challenged,"" in the vernacular of today.  When his guardian dies, Chauncy ""Chance,"" takes to the streets of DC and ends up in the hands of Douglas and his wife (Shirely McLaine), who are key players in the Washington DC political scene.  Douglas adores Chauncy and takes all of his statements about his gardening as political statements and soon has all of Washington, including right up to the President himself, listening to Chauncy's advice.

The President is hilariously played by Jack Ward.  McLaine's character meanwhile is busy falling in love with Chauncy, putting all sorts of sexual innuendo implications into his lengthy silences while he is watching tv. He is literally addicted to tv whereas she interprets his addiction as his being ""hard to get"" and the ""strong, silent"" type. This acts on her libido like a Spanish fly.  (I can't imagine that there is a woman alive who can't relate to her reading too much into him.)  At one point in the film, Chauncy gets to literally walk on water. Since he's pulled off everything but that prior to his doing so, it now seems natural that he can walk on water too!  Take it from me: If you miss this film, it is your loss.

The story: a simple-minded gardener named Chauncy (Sellers) is turned out into the world after his master dies. This particular gardener, however, has never ventured outside the four walls of the estate and only knows the world through what he sees on TV.
What follows is a series of serendipitous adventures reminiscent of Forrest Gump. Chauncy sees the world in a child-like way, greets everyone with a smile and unknowingly speaks in gardening metaphors that are interpreted as high wisdom -- even by the President of the United States.
This is Sellers' finest role, revealing more depth and skill than any other role of his I can think of.
Although the movie seems long at times (a few scenes could have been cut to give it a quicker pace), it unfolds in a most endearing way.
The ending of this movie is one you'll never, ever forget. I can still hear the voiceover (""Life...is a state of mind"") underscoring Chauncy's stroll to the pond. I love watching the faces of people who see that scene for the first time.
I've seen this movie a dozen times and find something new in it each time. I'm glad it's finally out on DVD, although I would have preferred a widescreen format.

The brutal honesty with which Chance (Peter Sellers) regards everything takes the rest of the world completely unawares.  Something appears to a few of those he comes into contact with to be not quite right about him.  To others, he appears to be a possessor of deep knowledge and they read into his words and actions, finding their own conclusions about what he says or does.
An excellent video commentary about how modern society deals with  life and the assumptions that seem to be carried by everyone, it nevertheless provides plenty of comedic delight and occasional headshaking amazement at the way people react to Chance.
The end of the movie leaves you with a somewhat spiritual grin and prompts you to re-examine what you had concluded about the movie to that point.

350296,5,6301590740,"This film came out in 1979 and seems to get better every year.  It is the bizarre story of a blank slate of a gardener who literally has never been outside of the walls of a single house until he is in his 40s or 50s.  The entire worldview of this man comes from watching television.

The basic story is quite simple. As Chance the gardener is forced to leave the house he has lived in as a child, he is hit by a limo transporting the wife of a dying plutocrat.  Taken to the home of the plutocrat, he eventually meets the rich and powerful of the land (the president included)and is taken to be an oracle of wisdom with his simple statements about gardening and the television he has watched. It is a great satire that just keeps getting better as we rely more and more on soundbites for our information.

The best part of the film is Peter Sellers who plays this absolutely blank, innocent, and slow-witted person with complete aplomb.  I remember an interview with Sellers when the movie came out, and he said it was a real struggle to develop an accent that had no roots at all -- a perfect blend of voices heard on television.  He plays the movie absolutely straight, the comedy being how people react so seriously to his child-like comments.  For example, in a television interview about the economy, people take his comments that ""there is always growth in the spring"" to mean an end to a recession when he is simply talking about his garden.

This is a unique film with lots and lots of subtle humor (no slapstick ala Clouseau). There are some very funny moments as people react to Peter Sellers, but the humor always comes back to how we choose to see the world. There is no deception of the part of the character of the gardener -- it is everybody else who plays the fool here.

This is a definitely a movie to own and to watch over and over. I know some people who have found it a bit slow, in that very little really happens -- it is almost a comedy of manners. It is a great memorial to Peter Sellers from one of his very last movies.",981244800,18,2047,4.293506493506493

350366,4,6301590740,"Being There (1979) is most definitely unlike any other movie I've seen before.  In my personal opinion, it's not a film I'd probably watch again, but the movie itself was very well done.  I read the book Being There (written by Jerzy Kosinski) before watching the film version.  I think this was very helpful.  It could be hard to understand exactly what is going through the mind of Chance with out a little background first.  It's understood he likes television, and that he doesn't do anything other than watch t-v and garden.  By reading the book, the way it is narrated, it's possible to get a little deeper into his thoughts.
The story itself is a concept different from any other movie I've seen.  It's a real light-hearted movie.  This is a nice change from other movies with a bad guy, and the tension that goes along with that.  The doctor, played by Richard Dysart, added a neat spin to the movie.  The fact that you had an insider suspicious of Chance's personality added a little suspense to the film.  It had you wondering what he would find out, and then what he would do with the information.  Both Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), and Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine) have no desire to look into the oddness of Chance.  They enjoyed the different spin Chance gave to things, and never tried to change him.  The movie added a bit more humor to the story, which is nice.  The book is funny too, but it didn't have me laughing out loud.  Seeing their expressions right in front of me made it easier to catch the humor.  Another positive thing that couldn't be done in the book alone is totally explaining the characters.  Yes, the book did a good job of describing them, and I was close in my expectations.  Still, in the first couple of minutes I noticed Chance's walk, like a grown child.  Also, his look.  I expected him to be a bit younger, which was obviously the wrong interpretation to watch they had in mind.  The scene with the man who called for the limo for Chance was great.  As the man stands with the car door opened, Chance thanked him for the car, even though he had no intentions of getting in.  This was a good way to get into Chance's head, without any narration.
Peter Sellers did a marvelous job in the role of Chance. Boy, was this a hard role to play. Sellers had to speak in a monotone voice throughout the movie.  He had to show no expression of understanding to what others were saying.  Chance would have no idea of what anyone was saying, and yet was able to answer every question they threw at him.  He did this responding with the only thing he knew...gardening.  He'd be so sure of himself, that his little knowledge made him seem like a man of wisdom.  Thinking back to some other scenes, there was some crazy stuff going on.  For example, the scene where Chance was going to ""watch"" upstairs with the gay men.  Also, the scene where he told Eve he liked to ""watch"".  Through these and more, Sellers had to keep a straight face and play innocent.  Very well done.",979776000,,2998,4.442201834862385
350367,4,6301590740,"I think this film is a fairly accurate adaptation of the novel by Jerzy Kosinski, but I still enjoyed the book  more than the film.  This says a lot for Kosinski's writing because I personally do not enjoy reading in itself, and for me to prefer  reading a book over watching a movie is monumental.  It's not that I didn't like the movie, I just feel that the book flowed smoother and was more entertaining.  By reading the book I was allowed to create my own version of the character Chance, and I think I just like the way I pictured him more than the way he was portrayed in the film.  Another advantage of the book is the use of Chance's inner thoughts.  The reader has so much more insight into Chance's feelings and why he does the things he does.  I also didn't like some of the backgrounds they used.  I didn't picture Chance's first home in such a poor neighborhood, even though the house was fairly decent.  The president was also depicted a little unfairly.  The film made it seem that the president didn't really like Chance, where as the book gave the impression that the president really did liked Chance.  I did like some of the added elements of the film, though.  The scenes from Chance's house to his accident were a nice addition, especially the scene when he gets hit.  In stead of just stopping between cars, as he does in the book, Chance is mesmerized by some televisions in a store window that, at the time, he is seen on through a video camera.  This is when Eve's driver backs up into him.  Television  brings up another interesting difference from the book to the film, which is that I feel the film played up television more extensively than the book.  In the book we know that everything that Chance has learned, he learned from television and he watches it a lot, but I feel the film  extended the part that television plays in the story.  Most of the differences in the film were just minor details, which are more than expected in the transition from paper to screen, with the exception of the ending.  The book's ending is realistic and gives the reader  peaceful closure to the story, where as the film's ending was a little more surreal and left the reader wondering.  The book had a supernatural feeling to the end, which did not fit into the feel of the story.  Chance was never portrayed as a special human being, but more as someone who runs into things by chance.  A piece of the story that seems unrealistic to me is the way things all worked out for Chance, the way everything seemed to be rather coincidental, and that happens to be the basis of the entire story, and it puts a bit of formalism into the plot.  Can someone really get away with the things that Chance did?  It is really hard to anything with out some form of identification and you can only avoid answering questions for so long.  The way this story was written and the elements used in the film make the reader and viewer think after they've left the theater or put the book down, which an excellent quality of any film or book.

She wasn't bubbly and didn't act like Jerzy had her in the book. That was one thing that was very dissapointing in this movie. Benjamin Rand's character was played very well. He brought a dying man to life with his portrayl. I thought that the movie moved slower than the book but it did a good job nonetheless. I also thought that the story was done very well and kept true to the book for the most part.

Being There is a terrific story of Chance the Gardiner who must move out of the estate in which he has lived and worked for the duration of his life because The Old Man, to whom the estate belonged, has died.  Because Chance has never been outside the walls of that Manhattan townhouse, and because he has a certain degree of mental debilitation, he knows not how to interact with the world around him, except for what he has learned from his faithful television.  Chance immediately is thrust into a world full of people who perceive him for anything other than what he is, whether a financier, a presidential advisor, or a mysterious international figure.  Chance (Peter Sellers, Pink Panther movies) happens to ""be there"" every chance that life offers him, allowing him to become a truly international media figure.
Sellers really does sell the audience his portrayal of the main character.  Through facial expressions and bewildering looks, the viewer understands that Chauncy Gardiner only understands the life of a garden and the social graces and knowledge that he acquired from his television.  When people ask him to contribute to their conversations, he consciously abstains, not knowing the subject.  When Gardiner finally understands a question or a point made by another person, he answers the only way he knows how, by talking about the garden.  The other main player in the story is Eve Rand a woman, who like every other part of Gardiner's life throughout the story, becomes intricately and closely involved with Chance.  Though her character is heavily involved in the plot of the movie, I thought she was relatively undefined and obscure.  At times, she seems a ""gold-digger,"" while at others, she is a well-to-do social butterfly with many connections in the political world.  I found it rather confusing and insincere.
Not much can be said about the making of the film itself.  The photography is rather unexciting and the editing is something that one barely notices if at all.  However, do not let that detract you from seeing the film.  I believe the (for lack of a better word) blandness of the movie contributes to the theme of simplicity.
The writing, which can be credited to both Kozinski and Robert C. Jones, who wrote the screenplay, powerfully offsets the simplicity of the filmmaking.  The dialogue is witty and fun, while being intelligent.  Rather than the simplicity of the main character overwhelming the dialogue, it contributes to the entertainment value of story in a way that can only be experienced through watching the movie (or reading the book, of course.)
The film holds fairly true to the book, though there are some differences.  Upon reading the book and seeing the movie, I decided that the book was more enjoyable because the reader is able to experience Chance's thoughts whereas the viewer is left to speculate.  This makes the story much more full and enjoyable, I think.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie, with a few exceptions, and would recommend to anyone to see it.  It is thought provoking at times, while being fun and smart.",979689600,2,3262,4.8963636363636365

350374,5,6301590740,"Probably one of the two best films Peter Sellers ever appeared in, and also Sellers' finest role, this is the tale of an 'idiot sauvant' who, through a mixture of a luck and the gullibility of others, manages to get ahead in the world. Other films have used the idea since - 'Forrest Gump' is the most obvious, but there are bits of it in 'Rain Man', 'Bulworth' and, oddly, 'The Truman Show' (in that the latter was a 'serious comedy'). The comedic heritage of Sellers tends to overshadow the rest of the film, and the critics have generally either ignored it, or puzzled as to why it wasn't funnier.
Like 'Network', it makes even more sense today - witness, as someone else here notes, the rise of George Bush - and it's very much a 70s film, in that it has a measured pace, doesn't have a CGI lizard at any point, and features precisely no action. Chance is iconic and ironic, heroic and alarming at the same time, and the film has an abivalent message. Should we celebrate instinct over reason, or challenge our supposed betters with more vigour? It's impossible not to like Chance (there's a bit of him in all of us), and the thought that he might be a more effective leader of men than a career politician is both depressing and amusing, but is he something to be embraced or guarded against?
The final scene is almost as ambivalent as that of 'American Psycho' - is Chance merely lucky, or an allegory, or something else? If he is an allegory, does this mean that religion, politics, the things we are told to take seriously in school, are all based on the ravings of fools?",974851200,2,1580,4.451724137931034

From the perspective of the postmodern image culture of the 80s and 90s, the reduction of political conventions to TV info-mercials, and the elevation of ""new-age"" bromides to visionary wisdom, ""Being There"" seems more fresh and to the point than ever.  Moreover, the film-making technique--with it use of visual and aural space (the constant ticking of clocks counterpointing Chauncey's ""natural"" relation to time)--is far superior to today's films with their over-reliance on special effects, unremitting close-ups (for the video aftermarket), and mindless editing.  Finally, Chauncey Gardiner is not merely a device for political satire.  He is, in many respects, a genuine hero.  He confronts mortality, looks death in the face without reliance on sentiment, cosmetics, or baby boomer cliches comparing life's unpredictabilities to a box of chocolates.  This is not escapist therapy; it's a provocative, thoughtful, even philosophical film for our times.",971049600,2,1051,5.578616352201258
350396,5,6301590740,"I have always loved Peter Sellers and Shirley MacLaine anyway, but after FINALLY viewing this movie, I bought it. Reasons? I get tired of seeing  constant action movies, Hollywood at its worst. Not all of life is filled  with beautiful woman, men and children, living in the stereotypical  American huge house in the northern subs of Chicago. We don't all want to  see a groovy, clean, happy, perfect ending. Like many foreign films that  bring real-life to the movie goer, Being There, gave us real life. It shows  how Americans, among others of course in the Western World, beleive so much  crap on TV, and buy it willingly. Chance's world was all TV, but his  simplicity is probably his saving grace. Even through watching years of bad  television, he doesn't learn violence, hatred or prejudice: he learns  nothing.  This is a subtle movie, so don't look for action and blood and  guts and a clear-cut happy ending. Life doesnt always have one, and it  certainly didn't for Peter Sellers either. Just enjoy it for its reality  and its simplicity.  The scene where Chance is in his room, watching TV and  Shirley is masturbating while holding his leg is flawless. I watched his  eyes the whole time and he didn't flicker any interest whatsoever. The fact  that a man could be that disinterested while an attractive, willing woman  is all over him really breaks me up. Poor Chance...I think he's the perfect  man!",967852800,,1415,4.768595041322314
350397,5,6301590740,"This is my favorite movie of all time. And I don't particularly like Peter Sellers!
It's a slow starter. First time I saw it, I remember being  somewhat puzzled by the opening, where Chance is revealed as a very  retarded middle-aged man, trained as a gardener, who apparantly has reached  his full--and extremely limited--potential. He loses his livelihood and his  sheltered place to live when ""the old man""--his mysterious  benefactor--dies, and the lawyers in charge of the estate evict him.
My  first chuckle came soon after, when he tried using his TV remote on a  mugger, trying to change the experience into something more pleasant; it  wasn't until this point in the film that things began to make sense to  me.
Throughout the rest of the movie, scene after scene shows 'Chauncy  Gardener' as a complete misfit--and highlights how we human beings, in all  our frailty, create ourselves and our world through what we decide to  believe. When Chancy speaks, his words are mysterious because they are  short and puzzling--when those around him try to make sense of them, they  take what he says as metaphors, and read wildly profound meanings in his  words.
(This leads to Jerzy Kosinski's purpose for writing the novel, to  highlight the foolish way people blindly swallow whatever tripe the  media--and our politicians--serve up. IMO director Hal Ashby caught Jerzy's  intention with this movie even better than the book did.)
At the same  time that people read wisdom into his simple words, Chauncy is fully  present and honest in the moment, and the other characters--to whom this is  foreign--treasure that, even while they completely miss that Chance is  totally clueless as to what's really going on (with one notable  exception).
The irony is that those people closest to Chauncy are led by  the meanings they insert to personal growth and transformation--even, in a  performance that won Melvyn Douglas a well-deserved Oscar, acceptance of  approaching death, as just another season in the eternal cycle of  life.
Other reviews I've read on Amazon villify the walking-on-water  scene, at the end of the movie; I believe they completely miss the point.
Chance has, by chance, walked out on a stone quay in the lake, and  doesn't even know that he should be drowning. He slowly bends over,  inserting his umbrella into the water, and looks at it with some  puzzlement; he is once again demonstrating that his total innocence is  protected--and he gives the audience the experience that the characters in  the movie have, namely, to read into this enigma of a film whatever meaning  they choose to see.",966816000,312,2614,4.9883990719257545
350398,5,6301590740,"The previous review of the film ""Being There"" doesn't surprise me. Some people just don't want to be open to lifes many possibilities.  This is an excellent film but it is more importantly a profound film.  Kazinski's book and screenplay are way ahead of there time. I encourage you  to watch this film with out any preconceived ideas or beliefs and I trust  you'll be moved in some way. Sellers' character is unique, original and  truly memorable. It is also one of Hal Ashby's greatest achievements.",966556800,,501,4.77906976744186
350399,2,6301590740,"There are 2 types of reviews for this film- the ones written by people who think Peter Sellers is a comedic genius and can do no wrong, and the ones  written by people like me who, while respecting Sellers' talents, can see  through the cloudy lenses of adulation enough to notice when a film isn't  all that good.
This is a film full of ""almosts"": it's almost  touching, almost funny, almost deep, almost satirical. Sellers' performance  is almost great, though the monotony of the character he plays prevents it  from becoming one of his greatest roles. It's hard to feel much for a  character whose range of emotion ranges from glazed-over and preoccupied  with the television to  almost-not-glazed-over-and-preoccupied-with-the-television. While some  reviewers rave about the ""subtleties"" of Sellers' performance, I  found it quite dull and uninspiring. A few words of heresy here: ANY actor  with a grain of talent and charisma could've effectively worked this role.  This is in contrast to Sellers' absolutely brilliant performances in  ""Dr. Strangelove"", which only he could pull off.
The pace of  the film is nothing short of ponderous, and the feel of the film is  uncomfortably dated. There are scenes and characters that could've been  left on the cutting room floor, such as David Clennon's entire performance  after his first scene. The later scenes with his character are there only  to provide a kind of false tension that Chance's cover might be blown. Why?  And what good is it for the audience to know that the president is  suffering from erectile dysfunction? Those scenes weren't even  amusing.
There are a few bright spots, however. I couldn't help but like  Melvyn Douglas' character, who elicited more emotional response from me  than Sellers. Shirley MacLaine's performance was a welcome diversion, and  her scenes with Chance are hilarious AND effective in developing her  character beyond the relatively flat ""cardboard cutouts"" (as  another reviewer put it) that populate the rest of the film.
(spoiler) A  few words about the ending: not good. I didn't take this as some parallel  to Christ. I took it as some kind of statement of Chance's purity, of his  innocent view of the world, on and on, and it still didn't work. It was  unneccessary and if you can find the story about how it came about, you'll  agree with me that it's arbitrary. Bad bad bad. I didn't want to believe he  was walking on water so bad, I convinced myself for a few seconds he was  walking on ice. I was waiting for him to fall through and die, which would  have been a better ending to this film.
So, if you like Peter Sellers and  have seen all of his other films, maybe you'll like this one. Maybe you'll  like it enough to buy it instead of rent it (I suggest you rent it first).
There is a reason many people haven't heard of this film, that it  doesn't appear on many (if any) ""greatest films"" lists: it's  because it's not that good.

Peter Sellers gives the performance of a lifetime as Chance the gardener, a low-key performance that is essential to the film's purpose,  and Sellers doesn't fumble for a second. Also with an excellent supporting  cast, Shirley MacLaine and Jack Warden are excellent but Melvyn Douglas is  the one who delivers an excellent performance as the millionaire who takes  Chance in and presents him to the most powerful people in the country. The  film starts out as Chance's employer dies, the film insinuates but never  really affirms that he might be his father, it also tries to insinuate that  he might be God, by making him walk on water near the end. Then he meets  Shirley MacLaine by chance and his bumbling gardening ignorance is  misinterpreted as quiet wisdom and he is soon influencing the most powerful  people in the country, to the point where he is considered to be a  presidential candidate. The plot itself is a satire on the modern media and  the effect of constant bombardment of television and radio.

350403,5,6301590740,"I recently read a review by a young movie critic who had the honesty to admit being baffled by the final scene in Peter Seller's celebrated last movie, ""Being There"". In this scene Sellers' character Chauncy Gardener  strays away from the funeral party to walk in the woods of the estate he  may inherit based on the wishes of his dying benefactor's and the prurient  interest the benefactor's new widow has in Chauncy. He blithely strolls  across the surface of a pond like a squire surveying his acreage, stopping  to stab his umbrella into the depths. We're astonished, of course, when his  `brolly' disappears up to its handle.
This, of course, implies Chauncy  is walking on water. Is this intended as a biblical reference?  I think  not. More likely, it's the director's way of visually depicting the same  surreal theme he has been developing throughout the movie: All things are  possible to one whose own perceptions and understanding is so retarded and  child-like as to believe in both everything and nothing at once. The viewer  understands from the movie Chauncy is no one spectacular, a bit retarded  intellectually, totally naive, without any formidable experience or  understanding in the outside world. It is precisely this lack of merit, his  obtuseness, which makes him the perfect foil for everyone he comes into  contact with. The others lay their own biased perceptions, understandings,  and imaginings onto him, so he is seen as being everything they  superficially suppose him to be based on his outward appearance; his suit,  his visage, and his mannerisms. He who they see as everything is in  actuality nothing. Nothing but the perfect fool.
He succeeds not because  of his native ability, but because he has none.  He rises to prominence  because our culture has become so artificial, so intellectually bankrupt,  and so superficial that all anyone around him relates to is his image, his  superficial appearance, his innocent charm and lack of self-consciousness.  He's a chameleon, the ""tabula rasa"" they then write the script  for. To the dying billionaire industrialist, he's a caring friend, to his  wife an erotic tease, to the President, a witty raconteur. When the other  characters in the movie overlay their own human foibles and shortcomings  into the equation of interacting with him, superimposing their own  corrupted values and ideas onto Chauncy's blithe but transparently idiotic  behavior, his nonsensical utterances become transformed into clever  witticisms, witty, thoughtful and politically adept observations. He is  ""everyman"" precisely because he is no one.
 When people no  longer ground their perceptions, actions or behaviors on reliable,  objective and well-educated abilities to decipher and determine the truth,  when they abandon the laws of gravity and chance, they enter into a  cultural purgatory bounded chiefly by their own ignorance. They travel at  their own peril through a strange and quite unpredictable world filled with  artifice and illusion. Such a description also fits the way the world is  depicted in the stylized fantasies and superficial plot lines of many  mainstream movies, videos and TV.
Unfortunately, the consequence of a  steady diet of such palpable nonsense is nothing to laugh about. The use of  such superficial and stylized models as guidelines for operating in the  real world is becoming much more common. Indeed, we're living in a culture  virtually transfixed by simple surface impressions of what things appear to  be rather than with what they actually are. Like Chauncy, we walk blithely  on the surface of our world, never bothering to look at the dangers in the  depths below. Unlike our fearless celluloid hero, though, we cannot  necessarily evade the dangers of an incredibly complex and increasingly  disintegrating contemporary society by merely ignoring them.
At the  surface all shades of subtlety are muted and lost; the rich panoply of  shades, colors and hues characteristic of a complex world are stylized into  simple pastel monochromes, representing a gauze-filtered replica of a world  that's unclear, indistinct, and out of focus. This loss of clarity about  the nature of the world and its basic reality leads inevitably to dangerous  over-simplifications of complicated realities.
We would do well to  remember that ours is a complex, multilayered world; forgetting this fact  is a well-documented recipe for social, economic, and political disaster.  As George Santayana warned us long ago, ""Those who cannot remember the past  are condemned to repeat it"". We must remember that sometimes things are  profoundly different from the way they appear, that appearances may often  deceive and mislead even the best trained and the most sophisticated eye.  We must recognize  these negative social forces for what they really are;  arbitrary, indifferent, irrational, and profoundly anti-human. Mistaking  them for anything less (or more) could be a truly fatal mistake. Perhaps  Sellers was trying to tell us something......",958694400,56,5038,5.289873417721519

Politics, especially the American variety, parodies itself well enough without needing sophomore films like this to repeat the obvious. What saves this film is a good performance  by Peter Sellers playing the simple-minded gardener propelled to fame by a  series of coincidences. The best parts are where Ashby gets off his high  horse, stops preaching to the converted, and instead lets Sellers loose to  come up with some cracking gags:
Gay sophisticate at washington party (to  Sellers): ""Have you ever had sex with a man?""
Sellers  (confused): ""I like to watch"" (he means TV!)
Gay guy  (surprised) ""Ah! I'll get Warren...""
And who can forget the  classic scenes between repressed politician's wife Shirley McLaine and  Sellers in the bedroom?
Apart from that though, I had to say the film was  a disappointment. The rest of the characters are just cardboard cutouts,  especially the president and his ""fixer"". Worth seeing, just  don't expect any great shakes. Ashby is a very overrated director in my  opinion.
