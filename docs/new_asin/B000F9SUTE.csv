8119457,4,B000F9SUTE,"This is the story  from the genocide 1994 in Rwanda. In 100 days would be killed about 1.000.000 peoples of Tutsi from the Hutu. 3 days before was the neighbors Family of friends. Unimaginably. But true. This film is more authentic as Rwanda Hotel. But the most typical film I suggest the movie ""shooting dogs"" and the book "" shake hand with the devil"" or "" I will inform you, that I and my family will be tommorrow killed""

Please be carefull, the  is nothing for senble natures.",1236816000,2,480,4.431818181818182
8119458,1,B000F9SUTE,"100 days is a too simple movie: The French Army is represented by one wild soldier while the Catholic Church by a renegate priest. If pictures of Kibuye are superb, the movie is a succession of clichs. It is a pity because what happened in Kibuye should be known one day.
I would advice  in following order 1. ""Shooting dogs"" & ""The Ghosts of Rwanda"" 2. ""Sometimes in April"" 3. For the mamies of Hollywood, the too clean ""Hotel Rwanda"" (about somebody not as clean as described)BUT I will never recommend this movie",1195948800,6,515,4.537634408602151
