8347228,5,B001W8NO48,"HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB
Long ago, the evil Alaric De Marnac (Paul Naschy) and his evil mistress (Helga Line) are executed for occultism. It then skips to the present when Hugo Marnac (Paul Naschy) travels to his estate along with some friends after a sance. His ancestor, Alaric, (he was the guy who was decapitated in the beginning) later awakens from the dead with his mistress when his decapitated head is joined with the rest of his corpse.

This is a very 70s style Spanish horror film. The scenery with the estate and the surrounding places is excellent, along with the atmosphere. I liked the directing and acting as well. There's also some zombies in this one in the later portions of the film, although they don't eat anyone. It isn't all out carnage from beginning to end because the purpose of the film is to combine exploitation with scenery, atmosphere, and a story; so Naschy doesn't rise from the dead immediately and start going on an all out killing spree. I, personally, was never bored by it. It's a great classic for fans of 70s Spanish horror that delivers the goods of full nudity and gore. Some modern horror fans, however, may think it feels too old-fashioned: Naschy's portrayal of the undead Alaric, the music and entire filmmaking style is from the 70s. As I said, it's a great horror classic. The locations are great with the house, surrounding lake and countryside. The women are also really good looking, and the gore is cool also.

You get a small booklet about the film and the DVD quality is excellent. You also get a commentary.

LORELY'S GRASP
This one is from the director of those blind dead films, and it's a great horror classic. Although low-budget, it's well directed with everything done very well. Helga Line plays a woman who transforms into a mystical sea creature who tears out peoples hearts. The scenes with the hearts being torn out with her reptilian, clawed and green hands is very graphic. The gore effects aren't of really high caliber because it isn't a big budget film, but it shows the hearts being torn out in close-up. There's only a bit of topless nudity, so it doesn't deliver in that area. The setting for the picture revolves around an all girl boarding school and the surrounding area. Like many Spanish 70s horror flicks, the scenery here is really nice with the sea and other stuff. I think this movie will probably appeal to more modern horror fans if you're comparing it to HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB, although it still feels like a 70s Spanish horror film. You don't see the creature running amok throughout the movie and slaughtering people all over the place; If you want a carnage filled monster movie with a huge body count, I wouldn't recommend it.

You get a little booklet about the film and the quality is excellent.",1449705600,,2795,4.67479674796748

8347230,5,B001W8NO48,"Here's my review for HORROR RISES FROM THE GRAVE:  Everyone has defining moments in their life. It's those times that something happens that you'll never forget no matter how long you live. This film gave me one of those moments. Back in the 70's, all you had on TV were over-the-air channels. Cable was just in it's infancy and many towns weren't even wired for it yet. You had to make do with whatever channels you could get with the antennae on your roof or the rabbit ears on top of your set. A lot depended on the area where you lived (distance + topography) and how big that roof antennae really was. I was lucky where I lived in New Jersey. We got all the major channels: CBS (2); NBC (4); ABC (7); plus all the independents: WNEW (5); WOR (9); WPIX (11) and PBS (13). We were also lucky to pick up some UHF channels, like the one that showed Uncle Floyd (who helped shape my demented teenage years) and Channel 48, the Spanish station broadcasting out of beautiful downtown Paterson, NJ. Since my father was somewhat of an anti-social person (to put it politely), the only time I watched Channel 48 was when he went to bed. I didn't know a lick of Spanish but, somehow, I was always drawn to that station because they showed wrestling (Lucha Libre) in two hour blocks and they showed movies, all without commercials and all unedited. Mainly, the movies they screened were Mexican comedies starring Cantiflas or soap operas (novellas), but every once in a while they would slip you a mickey and show a film completely unsuitable for TV (at that time). This film (broadcast under the title ""El Espanto Surge De La Tumba"") was one of them. It was my first exposure to the Spanish horror films of Paul Naschy and I haven't looked back since. This film was quite an eye-opener for this teenager (this was 1974) because I was just beginning to ""get into"" horror films and this was one of the bloodiest films I ever saw. Let me also set the record straight: Until recently (the Mondo Crash DVD), the English-dubbed versions floating around now can't hold a candle to the Spanish-language I saw this one time. It had much more gore and nudity (including full-frontal) than the dubbed versions. The story is simple: Back in the 16th century, a satanist (Naschy) is beheaded, his body and head buried in separate locations so they can never be joined together again. Before he dies, he puts a curse on his brother and his descendants. His wife also suffers a similar fate. In the present day, Hugo (Naschy again) goes to a seance with some friends, where he sees the apparition of his bodyless ancestor's head and it tells him the location of his body and his head. They all travel to his ancestral home where some of them (and the help) become possessed and join the head back to the body. The parts merge back together, he comes back to life and then revives his long-dead wife. They both go on a terror spree and begin to hunt down Hugo and his friends, using zombies, possession, a shotgun and their bare hands to exact their revenge. The last two surviving members form a plan to defeat this demonic duo. I know this film may not seem like such a big deal today, but back in 1974 it was something else, especially all the bloody mayhem that my eyes had not seen (at least not in one single film). The opening minutes show a man being decapitated and a naked woman hung upside down and then having her heart cut out. The rest of the film contained full-frontal female nudity, breast-fondling, breast slicing, lesbian trysts, blood drinking, a really atmospheric mass zombie attack, a shotgun murder, a really graphic scene of a heart being ripped-out of a chest (the film's highlight), an axe in the chest, a needle through the heart, not to mention one final decapitation. Seeing all this on TV in 1974 was certainly something I never expected to see. Finding any information about this film, or any Spanish horror film, back then was next to impossible. There was no internet or those plentiful reference books that are available today. It wasn't until a year or two later, when Embassy Pictures released a bunch of Spanish titles as part of a TV package, that I saw my next Spanish horror film. The package included A BELL FROM HELL (1971), THE WITCHES MOUNTAIN (1971), NIGHT OF THE SORCERERS (1973) and many others. Unfortunately, they were all severely edited for TV and I would have to wait a good eight years before I would be able to view unedited Spanish horror films on TV, thanks to VHS. HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB gave me my first glimpse of what the Spanish thought horror films should look like and I wanted more. That is why it's my favorite Spanish horror film and it made me a Paul Naschy fan for life. Thanks for the memories. Directed by Carlos Aured (HOUSE OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN - 1973). Also starring Emma Cohen, Vic Winner, Helga Line and Cristina Suriani. There are various versions of this film floating around on VHS (originally released by Charter Entertainment) and DVD. The one to get is the Mondo Crash DVD. It has both the English-dubbed edited version and the uncut International version. There is also a long OOP Double DVD from BCI that has both the uncut version of this film and the uncut version of THE LORELEY'S GRASP (a.k.a. WHEN THE SCREAMING STARTS - 1974) in both their original Spanish and English-dubbed versions. If you can find this version, grab it. Not Rated.",1432339200,2,5405,4.5779153766769864
8347231,5,B001W8NO48,"I am a great fan of Paul Naschy.  This is a nice copy of Horror Rises from the Tomb, and Loreley's Grasp is a really fun story with a great rubber looking creature.  Really enjoyed this.",1383264000,,186,4.138888888888889
8347232,5,B001W8NO48,"if you love cheesy horror flicks you'll like this package  of 70s horror. I bought this simply cause i love actress Helga line' she was one of the most beautiful women in film , Horror Express, The Blanchville Monster, Nightmare Castle with the lovely Barbara Steele, & a bunch of 70s spanish Gladiator movies . Plus she was so great at being EVIL & TRECHEROUS !!!  The dvds play fine and clear And i got this one used. Mildly gory and lots of fun.... Helga is a delight in both movies..",1360713600,,487,4.34065934065934
8347233,4,B001W8NO48,"I got this originally because I was into the Lorelei's Grasp based on reviews I read. I'd never seen a Naschy go this way or that way, and ended up watching Horror rises from the Tomb first and really dug it. If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror films from the 70s based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film looks great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fans - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scenes where he gets to paw his actresses' naked breasts every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you?

Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babes at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girls like idiots and send them back to their rooms, then shake their heads in disbelief when they're murdered two minutes later... ""we did all we could"". Some people like movies where cops are staking out a school being attacked nightly by a monster, and then one of the girls complains there's breathing in her room and the cops just think she's imagining it and then act surprised an hour later when she's dead -- oh those hysterical women! At least that's how I remember it. You get the idea though. Eventually there's a twisted dark reflection of THE LITTLE MERMAID's trans-species / terrain love affair and a cool underwater cavern lair.",1272153600,4,1510,4.490909090909091
