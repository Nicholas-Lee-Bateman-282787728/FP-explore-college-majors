8053340,3,B0007XG158,"rec;d in a timely manner, well packaged. Had no problem with the seller. I did have a problem with the fact there are only 4, 1 hr. shows per disc, and only 1 disc. per box. So each box gives you about 4 hours of play time. Apparently I did not read description close enough, or it didn't register in my dimwitted brain. I would rather have the Canadian version that has been censored. At least you get more bang for your buck. So, buyer beware!",1446422400,,445,4.186046511627907
8053341,5,B0007XG158,"I picked this up for the specific purpose of collecting Leonard Nimoy's appearance in ""I, Robot,"" one of his last acting performances that also harkened back to his 60s appearance in the same series, and this was cheaper than buying a season set.",1413936000,,246,4.744186046511628

8053344,5,B0007XG158,If you liked the TV show you'll enjoy the DVD's. Double sided DVD's. Handy to have the episodes with the same theme on one DVD.,1221091200,2,127,4.12
8053345,4,B0007XG158,"This is really good entertainment; well-written storylines, decent acting, and overall quite imaginative and very well done.  The first story, ""I, Robot"" derives from a famous Isaac Asimov story in which a robot is put on trial for allegedly murdering a human being.  This is an excellent episode.  My other two favorites are ""The Glitch"" and ""The Camp.""  Both will rock even the most jaded viewers.  ""The Glitch"" in particular raises some interesting moral questions about what it means to be human, and humane.

Overall, like most Outer Limits collections, this is entertainment aimed at the viewer's intellect, unlike most TV entertainment.  The thoughtful viewer will enjoy this collection very much.",1191715200,4,704,5.288288288288288
