7361811,3,B013C6OXQU,Good movie but the Blu-ray transfer could have been better.,1443312000,,59,5.0
7361812,3,B013C6OXQU,An ok thriller that surprised me once. My biggest problem with the movie was its motto 'human knowledge belongs to humanity' ... or something like that. If no own is allowed to own any intellectual property they create how is anyone who doesn't make a physical product supposed to make money. Basically the movie says that spending years becoming and expert in a field and investing huge amounts of time and money into developing a product gives you no rights to it.,1522627200,,466,4.695121951219512
7361813,4,B013C6OXQU,"Great movie. If you enjoyed ""The Firm"" you will most likely enjoy the movie. Tim Robbins plays his role so well. IMHO Tim is under rated. Plot was fine, I don't understand why anyone would call it thin or maybe they just didn't get it. One of the reviews talks about violating copyright laws on release of the code to the public. The code in question was in development and not subject to those laws yet I think.
Well worth a watch if you enjoy a modern Robin hood twist where the little guy comes out on top for once.",1522195200,,518,4.19
7361814,4,B013C6OXQU,"This could have been excellent with better acting (these actors were not at their best in this film). The lead roles were poorly cast. For a 2001 film, it was pretty good as far as plot and suspense, but the music was too loud and out of place. This is a good rental, but I wouldn't recommend spending the money to buy it.",1521590400,,322,4.126984126984127
7361815,4,B013C6OXQU,"I really enjoyed this movie. I could tell it was slightly dated, but hey... with the pace of tech, that's completely understandable. The dynamics and relationships took some really cool turns that left me fully engaged to the end. I just wish the theme of forgiveness and also bloomed forth into restoration. While that might not have been believable in this world, it will be hopefully in mine.",1521331200,,395,4.823529411764706
7361816,5,B013C6OXQU,"I liked this movie and thought the storyline held  up today even though it was made in 2001.  The plat was understandable, moral message there, visuals and acting good.  Im not a ha ker or supertechie but it seemed accurate and not confusing to me",1521244800,,247,4.444444444444445

7361819,5,B013C6OXQU,Great movie! Suspense at all times. Recommend it!,1485648000,,49,5.25
7361820,5,B013C6OXQU,Love  this movie! Probably one of my favorites. I would highly recommend,1484352000,,72,5.0
7361821,5,B013C6OXQU,"Excellent movie. A suspenseful and intelligent flick. Perhaps a computer Geek, like those portrayed in the movie, can see the mistakes made but for the above average intelligent viewer but not a Geek the movie was very entertaining and did not insult the viewer's intelligence like so many of the brain-dead comedies coming out of Hollywood. I would recommend this movie to friends.",1484265600,,382,5.079365079365079
7361822,3,B013C6OXQU,"The acting is good and the movie starts with real promise, though the music is much too loud from beginning to end. But the computer part of the plot soon gives way to a chase film with people running up and down corridors so dark you cant see whats happening. The fact that nobody is what he or she seems to be, I suppose justifies calling the film Anti-Trust, but much of the double and triple dealing seems unmotivated, even inexplicable and, worst of all, not credible. And by the way, if you steal someones computer code and publish it for all the world to see, that doesnt make it open source or give anyone the right to use it; only the owner of the copyright in the code has that right and the right to license its use; and knowingly and deliberately violating copyright, as by copying a proprietary computer code and publishing it online, is a criminal offense (5 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine, no kidding).",1481241600,2,925,4.447058823529412
7361823,5,B013C6OXQU,Love this movie,1476144000,,15,4.333333333333333
7361824,5,B013C6OXQU,"A classic movie for those who grew up in the 90s, when Microsoft reach its climax as software provider. Any resemblance between Tim Robbins and Bill Gates is just coincidence ;-)",1476057600,,178,4.774193548387097
7361825,5,B013C6OXQU,No problems,1473638400,,11,5.0
7361826,5,B013C6OXQU,"FINALLY they have released this on Blu-ray! Purchased elsewhere because I saw it locally and that was when I found out that it was out on Blu-ray, but I love this film. It's not a five-star film of its own accord, but it's a fantastic nerdy film in a similar way to the original Hackers from 1995. If you are an IT person, you should see this. Even if you're not, you'll probably still enjoy it for what it is.",1471737600,,410,4.1375
7361827,5,B013C6OXQU,Considering I loved this movie when it came out I am a bit biased as this is my kind of movie.  Overall it does have a great cast and an interesting message.  Plus it gives you a taste of what life was like before the current state of technology (I still find it funny that Skype does everything Synapse promised to do in the movie).,1458345600,,333,4.107692307692307
7361828,5,B013C6OXQU,Was great,1454198400,,9,4.0
7361829,4,B013C6OXQU,"It's one of those movies you're surprised you haven't heard a lot about in the past. One of the few hacker movies out there and a villain that you know resembles Bill Gates. It's not the greatest thing out there, but definitely something that is worth watching if you like a movie that features computers, especially that late 90 and early 00s feel.",1450483200,,349,4.555555555555555
7361830,4,B013C6OXQU,"2001PG13: This movie takes technology recruitment to a whole new level. LOL

When Milo (Ryan Phillippe) graduates from college and lands his dream job writing software at a multi-billion dollar computer company, he couldn't be more thrilled. The company's magnetic founder (Tim Robbins) that he worshiped as a child is now his personal mentor. As he settles into his new position, Milo uncovers some dark secrets about the company and soon learns that he can't trust anyone but himself in the high stakes world of computer technology.",1449878400,,534,5.137931034482759
7361831,5,B013C6OXQU,Awesome movie,1447891200,,13,6.0
8727205,3,B013C6OXQU,"While Antitrust is definitely dated, I was surprised with how authentic the computer stuff was. They weren't using laughably fake graphics and animations on the monitors (*cough*The Net*cough*), they were actually showing regular, old, boring code on the screen. The story isn't great - it's a lesser version of The Firm - but this is a fun little thriller I enjoyed watching.",1532563200,,376,5.080645161290323
8727206,3,B013C6OXQU,"It's a predictable plot seen in many movies before. If young and haven't seen this plot before the movie fine, but for those who have been around this is old hat material.",1526083200,,171,4.375
8727207,3,B013C6OXQU,"3 stars means ok -- barely ok! Ryan Phillippe does well and Tim Robbins is alright though a bit one-dimensional. Speaking of one-dimensional, the women characters and friends of color are so thinly written that it is impossible to care about or believe them. As a result of this thin writing, the suspense is not very powerful because there's not any character development. There is a little suspense built in climactic timing however. With these actors having a real depth, I just wish the writing was able to give a more fulfilling, rich or surprising plot. It was exceedingly formulaic and the opposite of what the Bill Gates-like character always asked for: Surprise Me! Defy Me! Be Creative! Wish it was!",1526083200,,709,4.867768595041323
8727208,2,B013C6OXQU,"I agree with another poster ""meh"".  The movie is very predictable and the writer/director's understanding of hardware/software tech is off.",1525564800,,139,5.95
8727209,4,B013C6OXQU,This had great suspense and plot line; still in tune with today's technology.,1525478400,,77,5.0

8727211,5,B013C6OXQU,"An interesting take on the conspiracy behind a software programming startup, Ryan Philippe plays the key role of Milo Hoffman. He is convincing as the idealistic college graduate whose elation at being mentored by the ambitious CEO, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), turned to anger when he discovered the truth. On a less geeky note, Douglas McFerran provides some lighthearted moments in his role as the self deprecating Bob Shrot, the law enforcer. On the whole, its a good watch on a Saturday night.",1524873600,,497,5.0
