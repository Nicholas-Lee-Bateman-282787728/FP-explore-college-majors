4690758,5,B005GJCGIE,"First of all, I want to start my review by saying that we have ALL the Barbie movies and my daughter has loved and enjoyed each and every one. From an adult perspective, I think some are better than others, and that includes this movie. I am not sure what the pull is with this movie, I think it's ok, but my daughter AND my son are nuts over this movie, and have watched it over and over and over, and so on. The music is nice and catchy and my kids dance alot to the music.

The movie is about Barbie and her 3 sisters making it to NY for Christmas and they get snowed in at an inn that is getting ready for Christmas. The girls begin to wonder if the owner and the workers are Santa's helpers. While stranded, the girls discover what really makes a perfect Christmas.

These movies are made for children, so, from my children's perspective I will give this movie 5 stars.",1321056000,20,874,4.165680473372781
4690759,5,B005GJCGIE,"Thought this movie was very clean and sweet. I guard everything my little girls watch. This one has no romance, no rude language or indecent clothes which I truly appreciate in this generation movies... The story teaches us that the unplanned may be better, and to have an open heart to accept help and be united in the middle of the unexpected. It's very sweet and fun too! My girls and I Love it...",1321056000,12,400,4.418918918918919
4690760,3,B005GJCGIE,"As an adult, I've seen a lot of kids movies...that goes with the territory when you are a parent.  Some of them I find I enjoy every bit as much as movies targeted towards grown ups. In fact, I feel that way about some of the older Barbie Movies.  This one, not quite so much.

To be fair, my daughter likes it a lot (if she were doing this review she might even give it more stars), and I can see how it would appeal to younger kids, and fact, this movie seems to be really targeted towards a younger age than the last few.  With Santa as an invisible cast member in this flick,  I think that is to be expected. I think there are some nice messages about how spending time with family is important and can be better than anything else in life.  I even think some of the songs are catchy, though definitely there is a strong pop influence.

For anybody who wants a plot breakdown, Barbie and her sisters are planning their ""perfect"" Christmas in New York City, where each one will be doing an activity by themselves that they really enjoy.  But nasty snow storms ground their flight and leave them seeking shelter seemingly in the middle of nowhere at the Tannenbaum Inn, where they are welcomed by the every-jolly Christie Clausen and the Elif family.  With a heaping dose of magic from a frequently mentioned, but never shown Santa Claus (Christie's Uncle), the sisters learn for themselves that spending time together is what really makes their Christmas perfect.

When seen from the eyes of a child, this is a cute movie...and since it is for the children, their perspective matters in determining if this movie is worth buying.  I don't regret it...I may not watch it when she grows up, but for now it is good for her.",1320969600,12,1723,4.438095238095238
4690761,2,B005GJCGIE,"My daughters, ages 6 and 3, absolutely love the Barbie movies.  We own most of them, and the girls watch them regularly.  The fun part of the Barbie movies is they have nice messages, teaching the girls that friends and being nice are very important.  Also, the movies do not focus on boy-friends, or princes riding in to save the day.  The main characters in these movies are Barbie and her friends (in this case, her sisters) all working together to solve the problems they encounter. There is usually pretty good music with good singers and dancing to accompany the message, making the stories nice and fun. AND, I do not mind watching with them.  I even have my favorites.
""Barbie A Perfect Christmas"" follows that basic concept, in that my daughters love it, there is a nice message about working together to solve the problem, and there is singing.  Where this movie differs is that it is boring and the music is mediocore at best.  This movie is an example of the creative team just churning out a movie to make money.  It is Christmas themed, so of course, there is an accompaning doll set ($50! at Target, on sale! Really??!?) and I'm sure there is a CD.  However, as I have purchased the CDs in the past (and yes, even some of the dolls), I will not this time. The music is not good.  The singing is not good.  I can't believe this is a BARBIE movie.  I'm pretty disappointetd in this one.  We have not yet seen ""Princess Charm School"", although it has been purchased and is waiting to be given at Christmas. I really hope it is better.
With all of that said, we bought this movie yesterday and my daughters have already seen it two times.  I'm sure we'll watch it again today and then again.  So, they did their job.  I sure hope the next Barbie Movie (A Mermaid's Tail 2) is going to be better.  I may do like the other reviewer, however, and rent it first...",1320969600,8,1871,4.392441860465116
4690762,4,B005GJCGIE,My 3 year old daughter loves this movie...Is it going to be a classic film in the manner of White Christmas and Holiday Inn ? No but come on its Barbie and the music is really good...all in all it will be a holiday standard in our house !,1320883200,,238,3.877551020408163
4690763,2,B005GJCGIE,"My daughters were excited for this movie coming out so I bought it the same day. We watched it I have to say I wasnot impressed the singing is not great the storyline is a little bleh it culd have been made a  little more exciting and magical  we have the latest movies charm school, fairy secret fashion fairytale  mermaid etc and we love all these movies but I have to honestly say I wish I had waited to rent it instead of buy it.",1320796800,20,433,4.070588235294117

4690788,5,B005GJCGIE,My child and I agree on the Barbie movies. They have a slightly more subtle and gentle way than some other attempts to entertain while teaching great messages. There are so few movies for a younger age range that have strong yet realistic female characters that have interests in things outside of finding or saving a prince. What a nice and well needed break from this that my daughter still wants to watch and sing along with. Thank you for being a non-irritating and enjoyable watch for all ages and for including all young ladies and teaching them to follow their dreams. We have the whole series and await many more like them.,1481155200,,631,4.592920353982301

4690901,4,B005GJCGIE,"This is one of my daughter's favorite Barbie films, so she's still requesting to view it long after Christmas is over.  It has both good and bad points, and is ultimately enjoyable.

The Bad:
 The sisters' fighting taught my daughter some new tricks. Now she complains of her younger sister ""copying her"" which I know she learned from this film.  The point of the Barbie sisters arguing was to show how they forgive and grow at the end of the film, but younger audiences may not understand that transition, and just model the poor behaviors at the beginning.
 Chelsea went missing at the end after going off on her own. The sisters are scared and have to band together to find her, but then there is no reprimand for her wandering off. They just giggle when they find her.  I had to explain to my daughter that wandering off like that is very naughty, and point out how scared her sisters were.
 Typically, there is no mention of Jesus' birth in a ""Christmas"" special.  Barbie wishes on a star instead of praying to God.  I understand Mattel's limitations on this - companies are so scared to offend other religions.  But I really wish they would have at least mentioned the true meaning of the holiday.

The Good:
 It was fun to see a Barbie movies where Barbie plays herself.  (In most films she plays a character like Rapunzel). I loved seeing her with her sisters too.
 My favorite song is ""Give It Away."" I loved how the inn characters were stacking up presents to give to the less fortunate.  I thought it really showed the positive spirit of helping others.
 Actually, all the songs are really cute and catchy.  Only the first song ""It's Gonna Be Amazing"" is self-centered, with each character talking about how things will be great for them personally. The point of that song was to advance the plot, but it may be hard for younger audiences to understand that nuance.
 I liked that the film's ultimate message was to be happy where you are and with the people who love you. I like that the sisters learned to appreciate each other and to find the joy in their current surroundings.",1421539200,5,2090,4.542780748663102

Some people think that Barbie creates unrealistic or unhealthy illusions- blah to that and all the sheep that follow that. What those sheep ought to do is teach their kids media literacy and critical thinking! I think Barbie is wonderful, and this is a sweet movie to watch with my daughter. It is well worth the 5.99 I paid for it on here!",1421193600,3,514,4.421052631578948
4690904,2,B005GJCGIE,"It was alright, average, but it didn't have any excitement in it. Fairytale movies have great themes, plots and villains. In this movie, Barbie was voiced differently and they didn't make up names for Barbie like Barbie and 12 dancing princesses, Geniveve was Barbie. In the movie, Barbie was not named a different name. I didn't like how Stacie and Chelsea were fighting constantly and Barbie didn't take care of it. Also, the characters in the classics are animated well. In this movie, gotta admit it, Barbie looks sorta creepy. Her hair does not look blond blond. It's blond brown. The movie's okay. But they need to fix the animation looks and bring back the classics!",1421107200,,673,4.810344827586207

4690924,4,B005GJCGIE,"Im giving it a 4 as my toddler loves the songs and reindogs.
However, the movie starts out revolving around Barbie as the others do but after they get stuck at the Inn and cant go to New York it shifts to all about Skipper and Barbie is just there.  As an adult one scene alarmed me, Chelsea gets upset & runs off with a dog. They spend an hour or so (film time) looking for her. When they find her farther away from where she should be, Chelseas explanation is that she left because everyone was mad at her, she played with the reindeer & ""mustve fallen asleep because thats all she could remember"".
Umm, if my daughter ran out into the woods during a snow storm a mile away, told me she couldn't remember going to sleep; id be alarmed. Not laughing it off like Barbie & Skipper. Granted Chelsea was alright and its a kid movie, I believe the producers couldve left that out.

Overall cute movie and daughter enjoys it so thats all that matters",1417219200,,945,4.273743016759776
4690925,4,B005GJCGIE,"We've watched this movie ""ON DEMAND"" so many times the last few years; I'm glad we finally bought it. It's a cute Barbie Christmas movie.  Barbie and her sisters are on their way to NY for Christmas with their aunt and can't make it due to weather. Movie has cute, original songs.",1417219200,,280,4.384615384615385
4690926,2,B005GJCGIE,"I have to say, I have almost all the Barbie movies for my daughter, and I've enjoyed them all so far. We even have the soundtracks to some of them. However, this one is, for the most part, deplorable at best. The good points: the girls discover that being together is what makes a holiday special, and that accepting offers of help is better than shoving everyone away and failing at what you were trying to accomplish. Also that giving gifts and bringing joy doesn't have a shape, size, or price tag.
  The bad: aside from the obvious fact that no one who made this movie has ever been somewhere far north in deep winter (no hats, scarves, or gloves, but high heeled boots?),.. the biggest problem is the girls. Jolly jumping reindeers, Santa. Who on earth decided that instead of showing sisterly love and support, the girls, especially the two youngest- Stacie and Chelsea- sound be catty? Most of Stacie's lines are demeaning and antagonistic to Chelsea, on a level that I find disturbing. And barbie herself, as the oldest sister and in the semi-motherly role, does nothing at all to stop Stacie. Not even with gentle reassurance, or any kind of discipline. I would never let my kids be so vile to each other. Skipper comes across as arrogant and self centered, and ignorant. Upon seeing a group of ""reindeer"" strolling through the forest, she asked ""but there are no houses here, who takes care of them?""  (My three year old chimes in ""they forage, right mommy?""  What can I say, she's watched deer wander our property all the time.)  And the very first song in the movie, all the girls talk about ""every moment custom made for me...MY perfect Christmas."" It is not good to show young children that being greedy and self centered, especially as women, is something desirable or glamorous. One star for the fact that the animation is decent, despite someone having a little too much fun with the technicolor ( blue snow) and a star for the whole adopt-a-rescued-dog part, combined with the bring-joy-to-those-around-you part. Minus three stars for the shameful fact that greed, arrogance, and animosity are the foundation of the entire movie. Wrapped in a christmas-y storyline and slapped with a big shimmery barbie bow.

At least the husky puppy got a decent lead role.",1417046400,,2276,4.7639593908629445

This past Christmas my wife got this one for her and it wasn't long before my daughter and I were watching it.  I was really surprised by A Perfect Christmas.  It is a good story that illustrates that Christmas is about who you are with, and not about where you are.  The girls have all the normal sisterly fights you would expect in a family, so it is easy to relate to the movie.

4691028,4,B005GJCGIE,"Cut to the chase:

Good:  I thought not using the cheap plot ploy of having Santa show up at the end added to the movie.  Obviously the ""uncle"" was Santa, but still left it up to you to decide if it was really him or not.

A couple of good songs - Give it Away was very catchy.  Others not so much.

This really is a Skipper movie, but it was a good story about her personal growth.

Cons:  This is supposed to be a musical, so the oddness of the first song before they left the house made sense, sort of.  But if this is supposed to be Barbie's real life (family trip with her sisters), not some movie she is doing, why would it be a musical?  I don't make my daily life a musical.  After Barbie sings her ""wish"" song, the whole musical concept falls apart anyway and it just becomes a regular Barbie movie.

I thought replacing Kelly Sheridan was to take Barbie in a younger direction.  However, since there are no parents to be found, Barbie becomes the default Mom, thereby making her seem older.

I think the animation on Princess Charm School was better, especially since they got rid of the freaky facial shading that has, unfortunately returned in this movie.

Most of the songs were not as memorable as previous movies.

Personally I can't tell that much difference between Kelly Sheridan and her replacement, so I'm not on any side of this bandwagon.

All-in-all, a decent, watchable, family Christmas movie.  I like what another commenter said about there not being a villain.  My three-year-old sometimes gets scared watching some of the other movies and that is not an issue here.",1333324800,,1593,4.487804878048781

4691033,1,B005GJCGIE,"This is hands down the most poorly executed Barbie film yet. Evidently, hundreds of millions in profit a year are not enough for a corporation like Mattel, because now they've yanked production from Rainmaker in Vancouver and shipped it off to Technicolor in India. It's a pretty telling sign of how little respect Mattel must have for us when they assume that we'll buy off on this visually ugly movie, because, ""What the heck, it's Barbie, so they'll buy anything right?"" Wrong.

""Barbie in the Nutcracker"" was made 11 years ago and the characters looked more alive than in this drek. In this movie, Barbie and her sisters are lifeless automatons with robotic motions, plastic faces, and dead staring eyes. The toy dolls have more personality! Mattel has always cut costs by using motion capture (recording people in suits like Avatar) rather than using actual animators, but I honestly didn't think you could make animated characters look this stiff and dead in 2012.

As for the movie itself, it is vanilla bland and harmless. The message is fine,if not somewhat overstated. There are so many songs jammed in to help pad out the thin story that even my daughter grew tired of them after a while. I'm so happy that she is growing out of Barbie, because I honestly wouldn't want to reward Mattel with any more of my hard-earned money for such sub-par offerings.

Their last, best movie was ""A Mermaid's Tale"". It was well done and was the last to star Kelly Sheridan as Barbie's voice. Unfortunately, she must been cost reduced as well, but she will always be THE voice of Barbie.",1326758400,6,1582,4.745454545454545

My older girls even said that the singing is really bad and they should bring back the old Barbie speaking and singing voice.  The actual plot is ok, but not great.

RE BARBIE:

Will NOT be buying.

Very disappointing. Couldn't even watch past the first 10 mins. Mattel should have retained the original studio and production team, the artwork/animation in this ""film"" is visually disturbing, Barbie no longer looks like Barbie. Really, this is horrible, just compare others and this side by side (look at the credits too). The animation in others is sumptuous by comparison, this is a step backwards and the only way to let them know is NOT to buy, then perhaps they'll stop penny-pinching and dishing up rubbish just to increase revenue. I know economic times are tough in the US, but Barbie films & their toys are bought by millions (merchandising is a big deal to them). Mattel's profits rose by 13% to $1.02 billion ... no slap in the face.

If you are happy to accept lower standards, ok ... but isn't that how we arrived at this point ... everything made in China and unemployment ... think about it.

Rapunzel is still my favourite, looks brilliant converted to iPad/tablet.",1325376000,,1239,4.904306220095694

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the storyline and score was decent (for its intended audience) and we have purchased several Barbie movies since.

This movie is NOT GOOD. There is not much of a plot and although there are some songs, they are not as charming or catchy as songs in previous movies. It seems like something that was hastily thrown together in order to be able to sell a four doll set this Christmas, and probably should have been included as a ""free gift"" with the set rather than sold as a movie on its own.

The only slight negative was the two younger sisters squabbled just a bit too much. The extra camping short movie is very much enjoyed but wasn't long enough. Overall I think more Barbie movies like this one would be fantastic. Mattel should release 3 or 4, 15 minute short films on one dvd, just stories about every day happenings would be great.

The storyline was blah - MANY boring parts - only suggestion of anything magical was the hotel staffers wearing elf ears and Barbie and her sisters getting into the holiday spirit.  The singing in the movie left much to be desired.  This comes from a family who buys most the Barbie DVD's for watching again and again, only ones we've excluded from our collection are Diary, Fairy Secret (you can tell why by reviews on that one) and this one won't make it either.  I didn't enjoy that Stacie and her little sister Chelsea were constantly bickering - Stacie always calling little sister a copycat, time and again, it was hit home more than needed - and not how I wanted my girls to see how other sisters behave.

Singing was not fabulous, but you get used to it. If all Barbie movies could be musicals, my girls would be happy campers. Throw a song and dance number in the middle of any ol movie and they love it I think.  Liked that there was no love interest, no boys, no ""bad guy"", just Barbie, her sisters, and some obstacles. Cute movie with a couple of catchy songs we couldn't get out of our heads. My parents gave this to my girls on Thanksgiving and we all sat down as a family and watched it.

The songs in this movie seemed odd and out of place.  The older Barbie movies with songs just made more sense & the singing was MUCH better than in this film.  Every time they would start a song in this movie, my daughters (5 & 8) were frustrated because it took so long for the song to end.
