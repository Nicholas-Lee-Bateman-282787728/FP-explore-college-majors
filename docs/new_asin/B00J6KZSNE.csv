6338089,5,B00J6KZSNE,"Okay, do them in this order. Start with the 101 video. It's a great introduction, and starts you using your hands to communicate. Next move on to the common expressions, and then the vocabulary builder. The other two are more advanced, but certainly worth your time after some practice. All in all, this will get you through your first - call it - couple months of learning to sign. Get this and a nice reference book, and you will be well on your way!",1368057600,51,452,4.392857142857143

6338093,5,B00J6KZSNE,"I LOVE these! They cover A LOT! And the repetition is very good and helpful. I bought them for my children as part of their homeschool program. I plan to buy the others they offer once we get through these. The only suggestion I would have for the company is to offer a detailed description of exactly what words/phrases etc... are in the DVD's simply for a teaching aspect. It would make planning so much easier. I would gladly have purchased a ""teacher's book"" for each disc. I am currently going through each DVD making my own, along with ""tests"". But it's very time consuming, because they have so much packed into them, which is a good problem to have! Great Job!!",1441497600,6,669,4.491803278688525

6338103,1,B00J6KZSNE,"This is not as advertised. According to the description this is supposed to teach you about the deaf culture which should include the grammar in which the deaf speak. This just teaches you words and colors. Not the correct way to sign in order to not insult a deaf person. The deaf culture does not speak in the same order or dialect that hearing person does. For example a hearing person says ' How are you?' the deaf culture says "" 'How you'. The videos are not consistent and they all over the place. If you just want to learn a few words these disc are for you but if you truly want to be able to communciate correctly these are not.",1422316800,4,637,4.229508196721311

6338105,5,B00J6KZSNE,"Dvds came in timely manner,  I love the dvds they are easy to follow. Some are longer than others but if you really want to learn to sign you will invest the time until you can enroll in classes. I'm learning to communicate better with my son, my 5 year old daughter is learning to and that makes me excited.

I would recommend this product to others",1420070400,4,350,4.208955223880597
6338106,1,B00J6KZSNE,"If I were to have purchased a set of ASL flash cards and video'd myself doing the signs for them, I could have made a better set of instructional videos than these. I HAVE FOUND BETTER INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS ONLINE AND FREE OF CHARGE. These videos go over random words and phrases and fail to show you how to bring them all together into having the capability of conversing with the hearing impaired.

6338108,2,B00J6KZSNE,"I was very disappointed with these DVD's. If you are starting out with zero background in sign language, as I am, do NOT start with this series. It's hard to follow what the instructors are doing, and slight variations in movement can completely change what you are saying. I found that out by watching a couple of excellent tutorial videos on Youtube.",1407888000,4,352,4.693548387096774
6338109,5,B00J6KZSNE,My brother in law is deaf so I purchased these to learn ASL. He says I sign very well and I've had some limited conversations with other deaf people and they also say I sign very well. I think these are a great way to get a foundation of ASL if you can't get into a class or if you aren't around others who you can learn from.,1404864000,25,326,3.8088235294117645
