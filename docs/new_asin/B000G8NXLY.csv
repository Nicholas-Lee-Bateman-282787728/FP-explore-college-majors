2602273,1,B000G8NXLY,maybe decades. I didn't know it was possible for a movie to be THIS bad.,1174003200,10,72,3.8666666666666667
2602274,2,B000G8NXLY,"In simple terms, Dreamland is a confused mess of a movie.  Some people will tell you it is actually brilliant and outside-the-box storytelling, especially if you're familiar with quantum theory, but even then you have to watch it a second time to really appreciate it.  I'm not one of those people, and there's no way I'm sitting through this plodding storyline a second time.  I understand the premise just fine; I just found the whole viewing experience quite tedious and unenjoyable.

The plot summary featured on a certain well-known movie streaming site described a film about two impetuous young people setting off to infiltrate Area 51.  That is a grossly inaccurate description of the plot.  Our two main characters, Dylan (Shane Elliott) and Megan (Jackie Kreisler) are in reality two dysfunctional adults who stumble into Rachel, Nevada and the outskirts of Area 51 (having no knowledge of the secret military site, by the way) on their way to Megan's family's house for Thanksgiving.  Dylan suffers periodic seizures, and Megan can't function without her meds (apparently anti-psychotics).  Eventually, the two stop to eat at the ""Little A'Le'Inn,"" hear some strange stories from the bartender, and then head back out across the desert.  That's where really weird and increasingly frightening (to Megan - certainly not to the audience) things start happening, which leads to a lot of screaming and running around in the desert.  What's real?  Who cares?

Alongside the weak and convoluted storyline, Dreamland also suffers from some technical deficiencies.  The dialogue audio is frequently too low; I wouldn't know more than two-thirds of what was said if I hadn't been able to turn on closed captioning.  The scenes out in the desert are too dark, as well, so you get a double whammy of frustration just trying to follow the story.  That's not a formula for cinematic success.",1359417600,,1889,5.087662337662338

2602276,1,B000G8NXLY,"This movie has no story. It has no meaning. I has no point of view. It's like a box of nothing filled with more nothingness, than it can't hold. If you think I meant that literally then you might like this movie. And that song Into The Deep Blue or whatever it's called at the end, made me want to reach into the deep blue and choke that guy so he would stop trying to sing. Can we please have an intervention for this movie and it's makers?",1344729600,3,441,4.0227272727272725

2602278,5,B000G8NXLY,"This movie has truly spooky scenes.  Well worth watching.  It is a fresh take on horror, more of an abstract thriller as opposed to a blood and guts horror movie.  Get past the first fifteen minutes scene and it begins to take shape.  Everything is the anticipation, it is not about watching a slasher.",1342396800,,302,4.537037037037037
2602279,1,B000G8NXLY,"I guess you have to live in the dessert, pop a lot of pills and somke peyote to like this hideous DREAMLAND film. What was the point?",1334880000,2,133,3.962962962962963
2602280,1,B000G8NXLY,"I started to watch this movie but was unable to hear it very well, even with the volume turned up as far as it would go.  Poor sound quality!",1331078400,,141,3.8620689655172415
2602281,2,B000G8NXLY,"The first impression within 5 minutes is that this is going to be a stinker.  The painfully slow opening scenes don't explain or really seem to set up anything.  They start driving a ""40 year old car"" which to me looks more like a 70 year old car.  While driving, the girl keeps having these startling jump up from your dream episodes that just get old after awhile that are only really meant to give you a jumpy surprise.  She sees a ghostly girl in the desert, they drive and continue arguing while the same scenery seems to go by repeatedly.  He says they are ""somewhere between Reno and Las Vegas"" like a dope that never knows anything about anything.  They stop at a diner and the place is dead, you get the obligatory obnoxious local and the cliche boyfriend who has to challenge him.  The owner steps in and as the obnoxious guy goes to stab the boyfriend's tire, he gets zapped out of the picture.

So...the owner acts all creepy and says he'd like to see them ""back"" again. So we foreshadow something is going to connect them eventually.  They then drive on and the radio goes haywire and starts playing the ramblings of Hitler, then the car starts to go dead and quits in the middle of nowhere.  They get out, stupid effects happen and he passes out, and she runs off into the desert like an idiot.  More ghostly surprises, he turns into a pod-person like being and all the time the car is driving itself around playing Hitler music.  So on and on this goes, and finally we see Hitler himself calling Megan's name (the girl) and she freaks. By this point I'm getting tired of the screaming.  She comes across the tire-stabber guy dead in some ruins of a building, another guy and then eventually finds what she thinks is the boyfriend, gets in the car and goes back to the diner.  More stupid scare stuff, and of course they end up going back to the desert again, find a shack that answers everything where she finds out somehow she's outside of time and is actually the little girl in the desert she saw who evidently is the sister of diner-owner dude.

The whole thing is a giant mess. They drag on scenes forever on things like watching them walk or drive into the distance that just go on and on and not a whole lot really makes any sense.  Low budget, and I found myself hitting fast forward a lot just to get through the tedium.  Watched on Netflix....and wouldn't pay for this if it came down to it.  Others say ""Lake House"" is similar...so maybe I'll look for that. It's got to be better.",1328832000,3,2506,4.387445887445887
2602282,1,B000G8NXLY,"I can't tell if it sucks or is an okay movie.  Unless you got a home theater speaker system, you can't hear the movie.  With headphones, or my monitor's speakers cranked, the audio was too quiet.  Screw this. In a noiseless room you can't watch this garbage.  Pointless...",1322611200,,272,4.604166666666667
2602283,3,B000G8NXLY,"This was a good movie, but the audio level was too low, and I had my volume control all the way up!!!",1317340800,,101,3.6363636363636362
2602284,3,B000G8NXLY,"This film is touted as being low budget and short in length. However the fact is that only had one small theme and was trying to be too artsy.

To down and out youths Megan (Jackie Kreisler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott)  are on their way to visit foster relatives and a possible job. Everything is plodding along fairly normal until they stop off at an eatery near area 51. Then things turn bazaar for Megan as she needs many strange characters including Rachel; but why Rachel?

Being a short film I'm hesitant about going into details more than to say that several times this was literally a ""stay in the car"" film. It requires repeated viewing to put everything in place. However I'm not sure it's worth repeated viewing. Actually what little is held together for any, continuity is well acted by Jonathan Breck as Blake, the man behind the counter.",1316908800,,849,4.6092715231788075
2602285,5,B000G8NXLY,"I love a movie that allows my imagination to just run. A script that can stand on it's own two feet without visual crutches: blood, gore, sex scenes (take a hint Sci-Fi Channel). I thought it flowed pretty well. Gave you clues throughout. And although this had some tech special fx the producters/directors made amazing use of light and shadow, great acting, and soundtrack to produce a movie that kept me glued to the screen.",1303603200,3,426,4.693333333333333
2602286,2,B000G8NXLY,NOT MUCH GOOD TO SAY... ANOTHER CASE OF THE DVD CASE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE BETTER THAN THE MOVIE.,1268956800,,93,4.529411764705882
2602287,3,B000G8NXLY,"This movie is probably something you will either really like, or you will hate, but I hope that you give it a chance. It is obviously a very low-budget film--that's clear from the start, so I didn't have my hopes up very high.

However, I was *very* pleasantly surprised. The story makes some sense on the first view, but you really need to watch it a second time to put a lot of things together. Most of the story is told with clues and hints; you aren't going to be hit over the head with the meaning of the movie. I would almost say that it might even be more enjoyable--you'd be better able to enjoy some very fine, subtly crafted scenes--if you knew what was going on beforehand.

Overall, I really liked this movie. It initially looks like it is going to be a horror film, and it has some elements of horror (which I dislike--horror, that is), but this is, essentially, a science fiction film.

To summarize the story without giving anything away, two young lovers, Dylan (Shane Elliott) and Megan (Jackie Kreisler), are on their way from Reno to Las Vegas to visit her foster parents. After sunset, they stop at a bar for some food in the region where Area 51 is, and that's where things get spooky. The bartender behaves strangely from the get-go. This first meeting with him is chock full of clues about what the movie is about, so pay attention to the interactions between him, Dylan, and Megan. A lot is said with their eyes. Notice who is and who isn't surprised at certain words and phrases. Notice especially how the bartender looks at Dylan, and Dylan at the bartender.

After their meal, Dylan and Megan proceed down the road, but (of course!) the car fails. After that, things get rapidly spookier. I don't want to give away anything, so I will stop summarizing the plot at this point. A lot happens, and we learn a lot through clues we might see or hear for only a split second.

Not everything is explained in the end, though, and there are some things in the movie that are clearly there for effect; they don't really have anything to do with the story (at least as far as I can tell--the clown's eyes at the very start of the movie, for example). But there are plenty of clues to put together a pretty substantial and interesting story.

There are a few things I didn't like, and I don't know if most of them had to do with the low budget or just a bad transfer to DVD. It loses a star for these things. The sound quality isn't great; I had to turn the volume way up to hear the dialog, but since the sound effects are much louder than the dialog, that meant some unfortunately loud moments.

Also, the desert scenes are too dark, again perhaps because of a bad transfer to DVD. This made it hard to tell what was going on onscreen. The color tones are an unattractive yellow ochre in the bar but they are a much more elegant and intriguing blue shade in outside scenes.

As for the acting, I think Shane Elliott and especially Jonathan Breck did some top-notch acting in this. Jackie Kreisler did a fine job, though she spent perhaps a little too much time screaming, and at one point, even though she had left Dylan lying on the road unconscious far behind her, she cries out for him repeatedly to help her, which is the sort of thing that ruins immersion, because she hasn't been portrayed as idiotic up until that point.

Still, overall, I enjoyed this movie. I enjoy puzzles and I enjoy putting together clues and figuring things out, so this is the kind of movie I like a lot, low budget and too many screams notwithstanding. I either haven't entirely figured it out yet, though, or not all the loose ends are tied up. If you like that kind of thing too, and are willing to ignore the low budget and live with some ambiguity, then you might enjoy this movie too.",1214870400,16,3789,4.401428571428571
2602288,2,B000G8NXLY,Other than the fact the female lead in this strange movie is semi hot...Don't waste your time. I wasted 77 minute of my life watching this not to mention $2.99.,1201046400,5,160,4.366666666666666
2602289,1,B000G8NXLY,"One thing I really hate is when I have to go back in a movie to see what I missed because I couldn't figure out what or why something just happened a minute ago.  I could have spent 4 hours watching this film if I had gone back every time I lost track of what was going on.  It seemed like there were some possibilities here, but boy this thing really got derailed.  It was a mess.  I wanted some thrills and scares, but all I got was weird.  Little Hitler!  What was that all about?  Never mind.  Just don't watch this one unless you want to really analyze it then if you do tell me what was going on.  Me, I'll take a good Tara Reid thriller anytime.",1181865600,6,652,3.992248062015504
2602290,2,B000G8NXLY,This movie made very little sense.  I was left feeling like I wasted 2 hours of my life.,1180051200,5,88,3.888888888888889
2602291,4,B000G8NXLY,"We watched a double feature of DREAMLAND and THE LAKE HOUSE with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and afterwards realized they were essentially the same picture, only THE LAKE HOUSE had storyboards.

What happened to Megan shouldn't have happened to a dog.  She's dead broke, out of a job, and her boyfriend won't even properly maintain this big old showboat cruiser with an enormous gas tank.  So that when Megan and Dylan decide to visit friends in Nevada, somewhere between Reno and Vegas, the car stops dead on the middle of the highway, in a spooky, surreal nightime landscape tinged with blue horizons and mesquite trees, and not much else.  The desert whispers to them, calling their name, which would really freak me out, and the only place to get something to eat is the real life ""LITTLE ALE INN,"" a 40s style roadhouse with right wing bumper stickers plastered all over its walls and every shelf in the joint.  There, they are greeted by an eerie, tobacco-spitting barman played by Jonathan Breck from the Jeepers Creepers movies.

They realize they have somehow stumbled into Area 51 home of alien crash landings and government cover-up, and the so-called ""Black Mailbox"" (which also plays a substantial part in THE LAKE HOUSE, for Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock each live in the same house in different years, and can only communicate with each other through leaving notes in the mailbox.  Stick its little red flag up, and you'll see it come down as thoug invisible hands had retrieved the note you put in it.  Eerie!)  Anyhow in DREAMLANDS the main girl, Megan, is played by an actress with less charisma than Sandra Bullock, and also the cinematographers have given her shiny bright blue eyes, like a china doll, whenever she gets stressed.  Which, in DREAMLANDS, in 90 per cent of the movie.

I liked Dylan, as the boyfriend, until a certain point in the picture when it seems almost as though he had become somebody else and his eyes grow bright blue and opaque, like the jewels of the Nile!  Though neither star has much acting ability, teamed together they have real nuclear chemistry, and I hope to see them again in pictures with considerably bigger budgets than DREAMLAND.  Poor Megan only had one outfit through the whole picture!  (Except for flashbacks to when she was a little girl.)  No wonder she was freaking out.",1179014400,7,2344,4.781637717121588
2602292,1,B000G8NXLY,"The film is considerably shorter than most in this genre and doesn't seem to have a third act. Which caused me to wonder if the film company ran out of money before it could be completed.

At any rate, it lacked direction and the minimal plot ran into a wall.",1178928000,9,259,4.18
2602293,5,B000G8NXLY,I give the film a Big thumbs up.  It made me think outside the box lots of clues to look for throughout the movie...I loved the jumps in the movie too!!!,1174089600,2,153,3.935483870967742
8129378,5,B000G8NXLY,"I give this 5 stars because of the creative and unique theories developed here about ONE group of supposed experiments taking place in Area 51, types of experiments I have not seen or heard about in any other stories involving Area 51.  That being said, I must admit the story is difficult to follow, perhaps because of the idea of time movement or shifting taking place.  What is real and what is not real?  A person must really, really, pay attention and try diligently to closely follow the story line.  There are a few visual effects that are somewhat different from anything else I have ever seen.  But, if you want to sit back and snack and watch for dazzling special effects, don't watch this movie.... look elsewhere for that.  The acting is not the best, somewhat under par.  Then again, these ""actors"" were all unknown to me.

If you have a person who may have seen something he shouldn't have... what better way to discredit him than to have him try to tell someone else about seeing German soldiers in WWII Nazi uniforms and using German speech?  (Just an example, remember... Time Warp here).

A person must remember that in real life, whatever that is, that Area 51 is not all about UFO's.  Where and how are participants for experiments recruited?  Kidnapping maybe?  Last I read, about 60,000 Americans disappear each year.  Dreamland is where many new aircraft and other weapons are tested and proved viable.  Foreign aircraft, and other weapon systems, are vigorously tested there so that methods of beating them can be developed and implemented.  Red Hats (Russian aircraft) is one such program, developed so that American pilots may better engage hostile countries which employ Russian made aircraft.  There are many, many different divisions and sectors that are generally lumped under the name Area 51, though there are so many distinct and separate entities and the majority have nothing to do with UFO's.

I would like to see a sequel that goes deeper into this theme, and frankly, tie up some loose ends that leave the viewer wondering..., though I must say, that if you really think it over with an open mind, it is good food for creative thought.",1494547200,,2173,4.7801608579088475

8129381,2,B000G8NXLY,"This movie made me sick, but even so I keep getting drawn back to it, from time to time. It is not made clear what happened to the people even though hints are throughout the film. Were there ever any alien beings? I don't know. What I do know is that there were experiments by our government. One, an experiment with propulsion, and then a special plane that Rachael's dad went up in. There was World War 2 but that was before the Roswell Incident.
