7832928,5,6302967872,"This episode was a bit short also,but is definitely another lupin anime classic from the late great company streamline pictures and carl macek(May he RIP the genius that he was.)

The action,humor and everything comes at you fast,furious and truly exciting,a worthy story of the great arsene Lupin!

Along with castle of Cagliostro it's a nice companion piece for anyone who has that copy. Like some of the other anime ovas I've collected here,it's short but sweet and gets right to the point from beginning to end,gets you right between the eyes,YEAH!

LUPIN FTW!",1370131200,,564,4.9787234042553195
