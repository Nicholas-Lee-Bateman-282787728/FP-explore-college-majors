and removes language barriers. I highly recommend it!",1511481600,,196,4.444444444444445
8565849,5,B0091T4ARK,"These DVD's are amazing!  I have been looking for something for my mother to enjoy.  She used to watch old movies, but now she can no longer sit still and watch television or movies.  She used to read a new book every week, but now she never picks up her books.  One of my friends told me about The Journey Remembered DVD's, they told me that a nurse designed them for Alzheimer's patients.  I never thought that my mother would sit still and watch the DVD, but she does, and then she talks about her favorite characters on the DVD.  She loves children and the animals!

My father was sitting all day and it was making me feel guilty not spending more time with him, but when I played the DVD for him to watch, he laughs and seems to be happier. I enjoy hearing the great music on the DVD instead of the television.  The other day he wanted me to play it again.  I just purchased the ""Best Friends"" DVD and I can not wait for it to arrive.  Forever grateful, Sharon Wilson, Louisville, KY.",1408492800,2,480,4.252747252747253
