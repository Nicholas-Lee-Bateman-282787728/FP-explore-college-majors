7877434,4,6304794991,"I use this video for my undergraduate class Earthquakes.  It tells the story of the Northridge and Kobe earthquakes.  It has a lively pace, modern knowledge, and accurate facts.

Kobe is really the story of earthquake-induced fires, much as was the case for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and liquefaction of dock facilities, leading to economic distress for years afterwards.

I give it four rather than five stars because tape is simply less convenient and compelling than a clean dvd would be, and the facts are right, but 10 years old now.  The 3-video set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nova-Earthquake-the-Science-Behind-the-Shake/dp/B000T8Z04O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nova: Earthquake the Science Behind the Shake</a>&nbsp;includes parts of this video, and IS on DVD, but is less focused and more dated.

The best way to learn about moderate earthquakes in an urban setting in an engaging hour, with emphasis on the tectonic setting and and particular issues of Japan and California.  Good luck finding it.",1266192000,,1064,5.915032679738562
7877435,5,6304794991,"The other reviewers pretty much said it all, but I wanted to add that this is a program that actually analyzes the dynamics. It looks at science in context -- why would 2 earthquakes with such similar makeups produce utterly different results in terms of casualties and damage? What can scientists and governments do in the face of this? What new hardware can science develop to more accurately measure and capture data about earthquakes? Can quakes be predicted -- why or why not? And the big one: how do humans adapt and learn from catastrophes?

Great stuff.",1218412800,2,561,4.783505154639175
7877436,5,6304794991,"Like the other reviewer said, if you want an earthquake docu, make it this one; besides the usefull and interesting information given in this one hour tape, you'll also get a piece of the action, and that's in the end what everyone wants to see.

Yes, you do see actual earthquake footage, of a disasterous Japan earthquake and of a Californian quake, taped by security cameras, and given that, the material is in actual good shape, no foggy black and white shots, but good quality footage, very shaking! And shocking to see what could happen again, when an earthquake strikes anywhere.

I also find it very scaring, but that's because I live in an earthquake zone myself. I experience 4-8 earthquakes each year in my homecity here, between 3.0 and 4.8 on the scale, and like LA we're also waiting for the big one. Although we had a big one (5.8) here in 1992, lots of damage, but no bodycount, because thankfully we also build ""earthquake safe"" here, but after seeing this you'll know if earthquake safe-buildings really exist. RECOMMENDED!",1103673600,4,1041,4.777777777777778
7877437,5,6304794991,"This video is an excellent informational earthquake video.  I show this movie EVERY year when I teach earthquakes.  It is 60 minutes long but the students love every minute!  It talks about the similarities and differences of 2 earthquakes.  The one that occured in Northridge, CA and the one that occured exactly one year to the day later in Kobe, Japan.  The irony is a young Japanese teacher who survived the Northridge earthquake and returned to her home in Kobe, Japan only to become a victim again in that earthquake.  The footage is great.  Afterall, it is a Nova.  If you only show one earthquake video, make it this one!  For as many times as I have seen it--at least 4 times a year!--I still thoroughly enjoy it!",994291200,8,722,4.578125
