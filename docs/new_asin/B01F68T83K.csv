8760255,1,B01F68T83K,"DO NOT BUY THIS! Unless you want a DVD with NO ACCESSIBLE MENU that endlessly plays a stupid jingle for ""starry night publishing"" over and over on a completely black screen that gives you no options to shut it up. ""Home menu"" takes you to the jingle. ""Back"" takes you to the jingle. ""Up"" takes you to the jingle. ""Stop"" takes you to the jingle. You will be singing the stupid jingle in your sleep and STARRY NIGHT PUBLISHING will NEVER Be my choice for anything ever again. WTH?! I finally figured out how to finangle the ""chapter"" and ""title"" keys along with the up and down keys to change from cartoon to cartoon, but that's about as effective as washing your car with a toothbrush. Stupid, nearly useless and exhausting. To top it off, the first cartoon I managed to get working was one of the suspiciously racist old Bugs cartoons that likely should STAY locked in whatever time capsule they found it in, another feature was a one minute ad for WWII war bonds (Which meant I had to suffer through Starry Night jingle yet again...And I finally gave up. I intend on sending this back asap. Certainly not worth the trouble. Pass it by, and pass by anything by Starry Night because apparently they have no idea how to properly format a DVD.",1483920000,7,1240,4.491150442477876
