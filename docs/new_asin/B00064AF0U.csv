It is quite thrilling, and if you like sad endings, this is for you",1389312000,,148,3.966666666666667
8038379,1,B00064AF0U,"I really wish I could give you a raving revue of this picture, which I have been looking forward to watching for some time, but I can't. I have yet to watch the movie. I ordered the picture with Alchemy Shop on the 6th of September. It was indicated to be in stock. A couple of days later the order was indicated to await shipping and then nothing for 3 weeks. I then emailed Alchemy Shop for an update and for another week: NADA. I have to admit at this point I had lost both my patience and my cool. My next email to Alchemy Shop canceling my order was rather blunt.

Up until this point Alchemy Shop enjoyed a perfect rating and at least on paper they still do, but I promise you I will NOT be shopping with them ever again. As for Amazon their record has also been tainted with me. I think it is important for Amazon to enforce strict rules of conduct with their partners, which I don't think they have in this case. Fortunately for Amazon I had already made several purchases with Amazon and one bad experience is not enough to turn me of. Two however is another matter.....",1381017600,,1079,4.237864077669903

A naked woman covered in cream? What was my husband thinking?

A gritty, realistic film about the crime underground in Santiago, Chile, the director pulled no punches with the sex, violence or drug taking.  And, despite a slight flaw in that the first change of character perception was unexpected and thus confusing, we were engrossed for the entire film.

The acting, particularly Antonella Ros (who played the stripper/whore Gracia), was superb. Rios' portrayal of the tragedy of a whore's hopes was piercing; Gracia was a sex-hardened, manipulative addict, but not because she wanted to be.

The brother's struggle to survive, and the relentless effect of a city's vicious underbelly, slowly corrupting and then turning on them, was sad and all too real.  In the world of those born into a grinding poverty, how else can they survive?

This is the first Chilean movie we've watched. While the English sub-title were sometimes incorrect, the pace and pathos of director/writer Andrs Waissbluth's film is what makes Los Debutantes an excellent evening's viewing.",1301529600,2,1419,5.9950495049504955
8038381,1,B00064AF0U,"Unless you wanted to see a female character gyrating around the film naked, in whipped cream and other yawn-inducing ""acting"". AVOID this film at all cost.",1242864000,,155,5.0
8038382,5,B00064AF0U,"Unlike most sexploitation films, this movie has a believable story line and characters. It's an impressive exception to the normal run of the mill porn videos with credit due to the director for the way the story unfolded.
*The movie revolves around four main characters; two brothers, a ravishing girl, and the boss. It tells how the brothers and the young girl got into their plight in a sympathetic tone. As the story developed, there was a scene that I had seen earlier in the story and I became confused at what appeared to be an error on someone's part. But that scene took off in another story line with a different character.  That sequence would happen several times throughout the film. I was captivated by how easy it was to follow along.
*This is the first film that I've seen where the story took many different directions like this movie presented. What a stroke of genius!! The director did an outstanding job of telling the story without confusing the viewer. I highly recommend the purchase of this video especially for those who detest the existence of the porn industry.",1222905600,2,1089,4.731578947368421
8038383,2,B00064AF0U,"Okay, this will be spoiler-free except for discussion of the structure of the film, which I will spoil right now by comparing to the film ""Go"" (and others).  Maybe it's a better movie if you discover that structural game of the filmmakers on your own, but the trouble is that without talking about it, there's really not a lot more to be said for this movie.

If you took the film and re-edited it to flow in a traditionally linear way, it would be a crappy movie, plain and simple - loose ends would be left dangling all too visibly, the characters would seem like old re-hashed cliches, and the ending - well, the ending is a little forced in any event.

However, they DO the thing with the structure, so there is one salvation that probably is the only reason to watch this movie:  Antonella Rios, who doesn't seem at first to be a very talented actress, is allowed to peel the layers of her character more slowly and evenly, and the result is that she shows many different faces at different times, and actually pulls it off pretty well, though without the ultimate cohesion that a better ending would have allowed.  In a linear movie she'd be okay, you'd say ""neo femme-fatale"" and maybe even add ""ho-hum"" - but here the revelations of her characterization are more delineated and I think it adds to the overall effect.

That's not enough to recommend the film as a whole, though.  I hated almost everyone else in it, thought the plot was trite, predictable and ultimately boring.  And last but not least, it gets the award for the most misogynistic screenplay of all time, which is really an accomplishment.",1138492800,,1613,4.576388888888889
8038384,5,B00064AF0U,The movie was marginal at best but you get to see Miss Antonella Ros nude through out the film in many excellent scenes.,1134259200,,120,4.260869565217392
8038385,4,B00064AF0U,"Director/writer Andr&eacute;s Waissbluth worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in Santiago, Chile, and perhaps that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing. OR, maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling.

Two brothers - Silvio the elder (N&eacute;stor Cantillana) and Victor the younger (Juan Pablo Miranda) - have moved to Santiago from their home in Temuco after their parents' death and Silvio works to support Victor's education.  On Victor's seventeenth birthday Silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where he encourages Victor to lose his virginity with one of the club's stripper/prostitutes.  In a tender scene Victor must face his nascent impotency while Silvio is out on the club floor impressing the 'owners' with his potential for hire.

Silvio goes to work for the 'gang' as a bodyguard/henchman and makes good money to support Victor's schooling.  But Victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named Gracia (Antonella R&iacute;os) and begins to woo her, dropping out of school incurring Silvio's angry disappointment.  Gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gang's leader Don Pascual (Alejandro Trejo) who is Silvio's boss!  Gracia is the glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of Victor, Silvio, and Don Pascual and the consequences of this bizarre m&eacute;nage a trois has deadly results.  Through a means of re-telling the story through the eyes of Victor, Silvio, and Gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that results.

Sound like a Chilean Pulp Fiction? Well, it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful, dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity (both female and male) and provocative sexual encounters.  But in the end the sensual aspect of the director's vision is what drives this film, playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success.  The cast is fairly strong, especially Antonella R&iacute;os in the demanding role of Gracia.  There are enough twists and turns and replays of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character.  Bordering on two hours, some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film.  In Spanish with English subtitles.  Recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of South American cinema.  Grady Harp, July 05",1121731200,6,2594,5.039812646370024
