in perfect condition. The movie was okay but naturally
not as good as the promotion for the movie. I am glad
that I made the purchase.",1264809600,,188,3.973684210526316
945528,5,6304989199,"Let's clear up that there isn't enough nudity in this film to qualify as 'full frontal' which SHOULD mean you know if the carpet matches the drapes because in 1974 natural mink was in vogue. That having been said, there is several women displaying their sweater meat without the sweaters. This movie has perfect example of 1974 sub-B movie acting that's primary purpose was to give women an opportunity to show off what assets they had. The idea of women fighting in Roman gladiator arena style combat is exciting, but you need to bring your imagination with you as you watch 'The Arena' because the enthusiasm isn't convincing. History says the gladiators knew one of them had to die, so they fought with everything they could muster up. No doubt at some point, somewhere in the Roman empire, women who didn't want to be kitchen slaves, whores, or waitresses might have actually been ugly enough that the vulgar and depraved Roman owners actually decided it would be fun to make women fight in the arena. I doubt they looked like any of the women in this film, but what the hey; I doubt if slave women could have fought a Roman soldier and won in less than a minute and a half, either. I've watched this movie twice since I got my DVD of it (wore out the VHS copy I had) and can't figure out why anybody would rave about Pam Grier showing HER body any more than any other woman did in this movie - and try as I might, I can't figure out why anybody said 'full frontal' in their review of this movie, and I can't figure out why it was rated NC-17. But I am glad I bought the movie, it is fun, had R rating nudity like that era's movies had, and I definitely recommend this DVD to anybody who likes classic 1970's classics with a R rating. I vote 'yes' buy this DVD.",1263340800,2,1765,4.351515151515152
945529,3,6304989199,"Like the title of the review says, this awesome flick is given a mediocre presentation. Why, oh why, does it seem to be so hard to find cult classics like this presented in widescreen?

I won't delve too far into the content; the plot involves female gladiators battling it out in ancient Rome. It stars not only the great Pam Grier, but also one of my favorites; Rosalba Neri (although unfortunately, she stays fully clothed throughout).

If you really must get a copy of this great flick, go ahead and get this one, but don't pay too much for it nor expect to be blown away by an excellent treatment. Otherwise, let's all hope that one day it will get the release it deserves and pick it up then.",1260144000,,698,4.403100775193798
945530,2,6304989199,"I would only recommend this film
because it is an interesting alternative
to the usual scenery in which we are
accustomed to seeing Pam Grier.

Otherwise, it's stock 70's female exploitation,
in which Pam Grier led the pack. Very little plot:
exotic women are kidnapped from foreign locales and
are trained in the arena, where they put on spectacles
for eager, bloodthirsty onlookers.  In the end, the fittest
of the fittest, Grier and Markov, are forced to fight each
other. Fight or die, one or both. In the end, they both
rebel and race for freedom while pursued by the emperor's
soldiers.
Not much else to it.
Even nudity isn't a plus here.

It was not until this film
that I noticed how extremely BEAUTIFUL
Margret Markov is. Whatever happened to her?

I think this film is worth the time, but I don't
think you'd want to buy it, unless you already have a
space on your DVD rack for once-viewed movies that will never again see daylight.
This would be one of those movies.",1107907200,3,977,4.565714285714286
945531,1,6304989199,"Yeah I know that this was a ""B"" movie but this was a chore to watch! I purchased it hoping like every other male to get to see some great nude scenes of Pam Grier and the few nude scenes (only 2 of Pam) are not even worth it. The picture guality for a DVD left much to be desired. There was no plot whatsoever but then again this is a Corman picture. Dolemite movies don't have a plot either but I'd much rather sit through one of his ridiculous attempts at cinema than this stinker. Like Pam Grier? Get Coffy and don't waste your money on this garbage!",1044835200,5,553,4.08256880733945
945532,3,6304989199,"If you're looking for a funky sleazy flick like Coffy you've come to the wrong place, as although this sand & sandals ""epic"" has it's fair quota of sleaze it's just not up to the Jack Hill standards.
Grier is great, as always, and Margret Markov gives good gladiator as well, but the film really starts to sag in the second half when it can't make it's mind up if it wants to be a tounge in cheek catfight movie or a serious Ben Hur style epic.
Good...but not good enough - thumbs sideways.",994896000,7,490,4.223404255319149
945533,4,6304989199,"This is Roger Corman's version of Gladiator and Caligula rolled into one, years before them!  And it's not bad, either.  Beautiful slave girls must fight to the death in the arena in ancient Rome as a novelty for the jaded Romans.  The gladiator girls learn to fight and then use their skills to revolt and escape.  Sort of a feminist take on Spartacus.
And the production values belie the usual low-budget restrictions.  The costumes, sets, props, and fight scenes are good, and Pam Grier, in her pre-Coffy star-making role, is feisty, pugnacious, and naked, too.  Her nude scene, in fact, got a top 3-star rating in Craig Hosoda's The Bare Facts video guide!
The bonus features on this DVD include not one, but two Leonard Maltin-Roger Corman interviews, but neither of them is about this movie in particular!  There's the movie trailer, trailers of several other Corman films, a chapter index, booklet, and a few mini- biographies of cast and crew.  The image quality is good.
Unfortunately, though, the movie is in full screen format when it would have really benefited from the widescreen treatment.  All in all, not quite what it should have been, but still worth it to all us diehard Corman/Grier/ancient Rome fans!  MORITURI SALUTAMUS!
""O Csar, Morituri Salutamus!""
""O Csar, we who are about to die  Salute you!"" was the gladiators' cry  In the arena, standing face to face  With death and with the Roman populace.

945534,5,6304989199,"After seeing the best movie of my life, Gladiator, I had to find other titles of similiar interest. The Arena seemed too good to be true, and I'd much rather see women fight than men.
The story starts out with women of  different backgrounds (a priestess, a dancer, etc.) who are caught and sold  into slavery. An argument between two of the girls leads into a catfight in  the food room, where in turn all of the girls get into a huge food fight.  Ceaser is informed of the trouble and gets mad at the mess. His advisor  says if they can fight like this, maybe they can fight in the arena as  gladiators. (The crowd have been asking for something new)
The story line  continues as the women are trained and then pitted against eachother. (The  fights are superb in this movie, especially judging that the movie is  almost 30 years old!)
Finally the women turn the fight from eachother  towards the fight for freedom, against the Romans. They battle roman  soldiers in the Arena and fight for they're escape.
Eventually they find  a tunnel that leads out of the city and find they're freedom.
A very good  movie, it isn't the best I have seen, but I'd easily give it 5 out of 5  stars.",958867200,13,1185,4.400921658986175
