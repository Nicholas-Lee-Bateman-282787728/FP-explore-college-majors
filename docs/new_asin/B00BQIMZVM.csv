8572562,4,B00BQIMZVM,"We've purchased a lot of different educational videos for our 2 year old son.  Some of them are terrible but we like this one and our son does too.  It teaches letters, the sounds they make and how to put short words together in a fast paced, fun way.  My only complaint is that there are a few quirky things about the DVD - for example at one point one of the characters says something like ""You did good.""  Um - not exactly proper English for a video that is supposed to be teaching kids.  That being said, it's still one of the better DVDs in our collection (even better than some of the well known brands).",1375488000,,610,4.17948717948718
