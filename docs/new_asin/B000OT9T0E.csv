8186629,5,B000OT9T0E,"This is a keeper set. Mr. Orlando Has a wealth of knowladge, and does a great job helping one understand the ins and outs of his interpitation of a blend of arts. A great piece of Highly skilled work.

 With all do respect: Mike T. (Progressive Kali Silat)",1288569600,,256,4.3125
8186630,5,B000OT9T0E,"As I may have said in earlier reviews, I am new to Silat and with that, this training is suited for those just getting started. He goes over the basics in great detail and uses analogies to make key points clear. If you're interested in learning Silat, these DVD's will reinforce the key principles of Silat and make some of the mysitical aspects more clear. I would highly suggest this set for the Silat newcomer and almost would feel you'd be missing something if you didn't check it out. For those on the fence, understand that Silat is an excellent fighting system. If you're the type that wants to do flipping fly kicks and be the next Jet Li, Silat won't be your cup of tea. If you are however looking to learn a fighting skill that can be applied in an urban situation, look no furthur. I'd also suggest looking into Kali, also known as Escrima and Arnis as well. Krav Maga may also be of interest as well as I believe the novice student should be open to the fact that all the Martial Arts offer something.

In close, BUY THIS DVD!!! You won't be sorry. Also check out YouTube as I've seen clips of this DVD out there so you can see for yourself......",1268438400,6,1159,4.341013824884793
