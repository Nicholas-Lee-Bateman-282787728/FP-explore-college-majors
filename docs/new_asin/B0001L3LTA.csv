8014016,5,B0001L3LTA,"Survey of Giacometti is well produced and enticing.  Regarding, the bad review(s) of this DVD, keep in mind, to find the real Giacometti, one must go and see the work in person, this should not be the sole representation to students.",1426550400,,233,4.682926829268292
8014017,5,B0001L3LTA,""" Alberto Giacometti ""  the DVD, is an excellent complete visual catalog of the sculptors works.  The commentary identifies the year the work was created and if it was a breakthrough work that influenced future works.  This is not an explanation of abstraction or symbolism. It is best for someone already familiar with the artist' work. If you are a teacher, it could be helpful in exposing students to Giacometti's work. However, it would be best if you already understand the traditions of sculpture and can explain the development of art through the 20th century and up to the present to your students.  This is not a film that by itself can be swallowed like a pill, to  "" turn on "" students to make stick figure Giacometti inspired sculpture. It is an intelligent complete review of Giacometti's lifetime of work and a welcome addition to the visual material available on the artist.  Buy it.",1376438400,,898,4.7612903225806456
8014018,1,B0001L3LTA,"I bought this DVD to introduce my Art I high school students to the work of Alberto Giacommetti before we created a project emulating his sculpture. I am so sorry to say that although the DVD does tell about his life and his work, it was horribly BORING...even for me! I will not be showing this DVD in class again.
I'm also afraid that many of the DVDs featured in the Artists of the 20th Century series are not top-notch productions. Do yourself a favor and skip them all.",1357948800,3,474,4.337078651685394
8014019,4,B0001L3LTA,This DVD is has a good collection of Giacometti's work as well as a nice bio.  I enjoyed it and showed in a class I was coordinating on Modern Art.,1220572800,3,147,3.9
8014020,4,B0001L3LTA,"Faster and easier introduction than reading a monograph.  Alberto Giacometti (Artists of the 20th Century) presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is competent, detailed enough, and quite comprehensive, but only for a person with a solid art knowledge and established art understanding who is immune to the contentious remarks made by the narrator from time to time. Some works considered self-explanatory by the narrator are left without a comment. This documentary includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional work analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good.",1196640000,5,696,5.444444444444445
