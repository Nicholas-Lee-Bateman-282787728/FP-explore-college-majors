135287,4,0792110188,"James Caan can't sing like Ricky Nelson, and Arthur Hunnicutt isn't as amusing as Walter Brennan, but Howard Hawks' rehash of his own classic  ""Rio Bravo"" is almost as entertaining, though not likely to  challenge the earlier film's classic status.  John Wayne is his usual self  as a gunfighter, and Robert Mitchum, stepping in for Dean Martin as the  drunken sheriff, doesn't earn the viewer's sympathy quite as much as ol'  Dino did, but the script (by Leigh Brackett who also worked on the earlier  film) is probably to blame there.  All in all, a very pleasant way to spend  two hours.",927244800,4,590,4.705882352941177

135329,5,0792110188,"A terrifically fun film featuring the looser, more enjoyable Wayne of the 2nd half of his career -- though enormously similar to the wonderful ""Rio Bravo,"" it has its own set of charms, not the least of which are Robert Mitchum as the drunk Sheriff; a young James Caan as a knife-throwing, shotgun-blasting ally; Charlene Holt and  Michelle Carey as atypically strong women for the genre; veteran character actor Arthur Hunnicutt as a lean old coot loaded with funny retorts as well as a bow and arrow; and Ed Asner taking a turn as the town land baron and bully.

135349,4,0792110188,"In this one, John Wayne is a hired gun, deputized at the last act of the film.
There's a ""cavalry-trilogy"", and a ""sheriff-trilogy"". Rio Bravo('59); El Dorado('66); and Rio Lobo('70) are Howard Hawk's latter.
John Wayne's character is---pretty much---the same, as are the drunk [sheriff this time] and singing sidekick nicknamed after a state.
In both movies, ""The Duke"" helps an old, drunken deputy/sheriff friend, and an older comic-relief, deputy, sidekick, keep a bad guy in jail.
Drunken sheriff: Robert Mitchum (El Dorado) has a slight edge over Dean Martin's (Rio Bravo).
Sidekick: James Caan's ""Mississippi"" (in El Dorado) is more likable than the Ricky Nelson (Rio Bravo) ""Colorado"".
Crusty OLD deputy: Walter Brennan (Rio Bravo) towers over---though good---Arthur Hunnicutt (El Dorado).
Ladyfriend: Angie Dickinson (Rio Bravo) wins over whatever the other actress's name was in the other flick.
Prisoner: Ed Asner over Claude Aikens... but just because Ed plays it like ""Mister Grant"" on THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.
Get 'em all: RIO BRAVO; EL DORADO; and RIO LOBO. All widescreen, but the last two are 5.1 Surround Sound to boot!",1498867200,3,1138,5.258241758241758

135386,5,0792110188,"The movie itself gets 5-Stars. It's basically Rio Bravo with a slightly different story. It's still really good and entertaining. I'd give Rio Bravo only a slight recommendation over this. El Dorado has some editing flaws both with sound and picture. At one point, Duke is mid sentence in a bar scene when the scene cuts away. There's also another instance where James Caan dives under some horses and the editing was like that of a silent film. It was pretty ugly.
As for the Blu-Ray, WOW! I've gotten about 24 John Wayne movies since deciding that I wanted to start a collection back in 2009. Half of them are on Blu-Ray and look great for the most part. For whatever reason, I was blown away by how beautiful the picture looked for El Dorado. I mean they really cleaned it up and the color just jumps out of the screen. It's as if you're watching the movie on set. The extras are okay but of course I want as much info as I can get about Duke.
I still love this movie and it's one of my favorites in the collection.",1483660800,4,1018,4.307291666666667

135411,4,0792110188,"As a youth I tried to watch every John Wayne western.  This is a fairly typical example of such a western.  The director is Howard Hawks.  John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are, of course, iconic.  This is a very early role of James Caan.  Mr. Hawks directed a previous western with John Wayne, ""Rio Bravo"".  To be honest about it, this movie is very similar.  However, I do like ""El Dorado"" better.

My very favorite John Wayne westerns come both earlier, ""The Searchers"", and the so called Calvary Triology,  And later in John Wayne's career, ""True Grit"", and ""The Shootist"".  But this movie is a pretty good middle career western for John Wayne.",1480204800,,644,4.619469026548672

135470,5,0792110188,"To Leigh Bracketts dismay, she was asked to more or less rewrite Rio Bravo and call it El Dorado.  Apparently, she kept telling Howard Hawks that they had already done that (also, again, in Rio Lobo).  Hawks was of a mind though, that if it worked once it will work again!  Fortunately, she didn't get her way because she wanted Wayne to die at the end of this movie!!!

Even with an overly familiar plot, this is a fun movie.  James Caans hat alone provided much humor.  A great cast (even though Arthur Hunnicutt is no Walter Brennan).  I did feel sorry for poor Johnny Crawford, gut shot, with just a few lines to distinguish him before he was slung over a horse, dead.  If it comes to that, Jim Davis didn't fare any better in a blink and youll miss him appearance (the same goes for Robert Mitchums brother John, appearing briefly as Elmer the bartender).  Makes no difference as this was all about Wayne and Mitchum.

135486,5,0792110188,"Awesome treatment of an awesome classic Hawks film in bluray. I had this film years ago in dvd but moved up to  bluray .  Excellent commentary by Peter Bogdanovich and other historical commentary made me appreciate the film and Hawks filmmaking techniques ( which are thoroughly documented). For instance I now realize that I have loved Mitchum's work in this film: one commentator remarked that Mitchum's timing, rhythm and cadence was a perfect match for Hawk's slower, more deliberate style. Also Hawks let Mitchum work at his own pace and appreciated his fine work as an actor. That's just one example. In my opinion this is the only film in Wayne's career that the co-star equalled him in on screen presence -- Lee Marvin in Liberty Valence not quite doing it for me. In bluray the painstaking lighting and cinematography is just splendid, soundtrack is great though monophonic,the action intense and meaningful, and the comedy deep, plentiful and based on astute observations. Arthur Hunnicuts possibly best performance as Bull the bugle blowing Indian Fighter is a treat at every viewing.",1463011200,5,1095,5.0777777777777775

135499,5,0792110188,"El Dorado, released States-side in 1967, is very loosely based on a novel titled The Stars in Their Courses by some literary cat named Harry Brown. I opened with that to get it out of the way. What happened was that the fantastic screenwriter (and creator of Eric John Stark, interplanetary swashbuckler!) Leigh Brackett, when she adapted book to celluloid, excised most of what Brown had wrought and so created a more rollicking narrative. Yep, El Dorado is director Howard Hawks' first remake of his earlier banging western Rio Bravo (1959), a movie so awesome and so influential it inspired a second remake by Hawks in Rio Lobo (1970), as well as countless other movies not by Hawks, most notably, Assault on Precinct 13 (1976).

I count El Dorado a bonafide classic, but maybe not quite the classic that Rio Bravo is. It's absent of that original freshness. This cast is essentially a reprise of the cast in Rio Bravo. Still, Robert Mitchum brings his own droll swerve to Dean Martin's discarded drunk. James Caan's ""Mississippi"" exudes more personality than Ricky Nelson's ""Colorado,"" only, Caan slyly slings poetry instead of winsomely warbling a tune. An alluring dame in the saloon hospitality business pines once more for our star, and Charlene Holt's Maudie is perfectly fine even if she's not as memorable as Angie Dickinson's Feathers. Yo, there's bugle-tootin' Arthur Hunnicutt mustering up his best ornery Walter Brennan impersonation. And, above all, there's John Wayne playing John Wayne, oh, a tad longer in the tooth but still tall in the saddle and very much capable of coming to the aid of a beleaguered old friend. Wayne's role of aging gun-for-hire, Cole Thornton, is made even more interesting by a bullet lodged next to his spine, a messed-up state that causes hurtful spasms and temporary paralysis in the most inopportune moments.

The plot, in short, concerns a range feud over water rights. The action beats pit a covetous land owner and his nasty hired guns against ""two cripples, a green kid, and a noisy old Indian-fighter."" The shoot-'em-up sequences are dope, mind you. Duke, Mitchum, and Caan are asskickers of the first order. But I was equally invested in Cole Thornton's relationships with the peeps around him. Duke is in his wheelhouse when he's reacting to other actors and when he's playing the cranky and baffled straight man. Mitchum, Caan, and Hunnicutt provide generous doses of levity, with Caan very startled to learn that his was a comic role. He afterwards called out Hawks on it: ""Why didn't you tell me I was playing a comic part?"" Hawks's reponse: ""You'd have spoiled it. You'd have tried to be funny."" Caan is a hoot. Mississippi sure 'nuff has got sand. He can handle himself in a scrap. But it's amusing that he's such a bad shot he has to resort to blasting with a sawed-off shotgun. And, 1ord, how he kept quoting from Poe's poem, ""Eldorado,"" but kept on misquoting the verse ""Ride, boldly ride"" as ""Ride, Bodie, ride."" The funniest sequence has to be when the boys were trying to sober up Sheriff J.P. Harrah (Mitchum), him what's been prodigiously three sheets to the wind these two months running. By the by, I dare you to try Mississippi's infamous concoction to cure a tipsy state - ingredients include cayenne pepper, hot mustard, gunpowder, croton oil (which induces diarrhea), and asafoetida. I don't know if that spicy junk'll counter inebriation but I'd for sure like it to douse my daily breakfast burrito with.

But what an entertaining film - a colorful, raucous, action-packed, old-timey watch. Some say El Dorado lacks the focus of Rio Bravo, that it rambles around. But, to me, the plot's meanderings meant more opportunity to explore the characters, to allow us more time to know them during the minutiae of their everyday livin'. Wayne is such a big presence, he towers above all, although Mitchum isn't too far behind. It's these two impeccable screen veterans that make the thing work so beautifully. They lend gravitas to whatever's happening onscreen and a convincing sense of history between their characters, it's that kind of synergy between them. And when the time came to quit speechifyin' and commence to slapping leather, well, they're convincing there, too. And I loved the topsy-turvy manner in which Wayne's damaged (but pragmatic) gunfighter bested his big bad. When I first saw that ending, it floored me because I didn't expect Wayne to stoop to... well, go see the movie. Not quite as good as Rio Bravo, but it kicks other westerns to the curb.

Trivia time: Did you know that the paintings in the credits were painted by Olaf Wieghorst, who plays Swede Larsen - he supplied Mississippi with his mini-cannon - in the movie?",1460246400,9,4716,4.8986232790988735

""El Dorado"" is a tightly directed, humorous, altogether successful Western, turned out almost effortlessly, it would seem, by three old pros: John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and director Howard Hawks."" And I have to agree as this timeless western classic never seems to grow old and just like an old friend one never grows tired of visiting. The blu-ray transfer is beautiful and a large part of it is lovingly filmed at night by cinemaphotographer Harold Rosson who would take as long as an hour and a half to set up the lighting in the night scenes because he wanted those scenes to emulate the paintings of classic western artists. Incidentally, the gentleman who played the gunsmith Swede Larson ( Olaf Wieghorst) was his first attempt at acting. His profession was a western painter and he did the paintings for the background of the opening credits of this film. The score for the film was by Nelson Riddle who is famous for his jazzy themes ( the theme music to the original ""Emergency"" TV show to name just one) and it shows in a couple of the scenes such as when they are hunting down the three baddies who are holed up in a church. There are three documentaries that accompany the disc. One on director Howard Hawks; Ride Boldly Ride: The Journey To Eldorado. Another on the artist Olaf Wieghorst; The Artist and the American West. And a third Behind the Gates: A.C. Lyles Remembers John Wayne. There are two commentaries. One by Director Peter Bogdanovich, and the other commentary by film Historian and Critic Richard Schickel, Actor Ed Asner and Author Todd McCarthy. Although I did give this movie a much deserved 5-star rating the disc has a problem like I've never run into before. Neither the theatrical preview nor the third documentary (Behind the Gates) are watchable as the picture freezes up on black then white noise picture then a frozen scene and keeps going like that. Weird!
One behind the scenes tidbit that Peter Bogdanovich told on John Wayne was that he always stuck around between shoots. He was always doing something, as Mr. Bogdanovich described Duke Wayne as very fidgety between shots unlike the other actors like Robert Mitchum who always went to his trailer between shots. Duke Wayne and James Caan would often play chess as well between scenes just like he did with Dean Martin on the set of Rio Bravo.
In spite of the discs shortcomings the movie does play just fine and the 1080p sparkles and it is nearly like watching the movie for the first time all over again what with eye-popping details in costume embroidery and set decoration that is all the more evident since this is a full-screen 16 x 9 transfer in gorgeous Technicolor.",1454889600,3,2748,4.727083333333334

135544,4,0792110188,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this John Wayne western...

El Dorado (1967) stars John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, James Caan, and Charlene Holt.  This movie is almost considered a remake of Rio Bravo (1959) due to the very similar plot lines in both movies.  I actually like El Dorado better than Rio Bravo.  It's a good western that's considered a classic.  It's heavy on dialogue, but at the same time has plenty of action as well.  There is some good scenery throughout and the dusk and night scenes stand out.  I particularly like the nighttime bell tower sequence.  The acting is okay - not bad, not great.  The musical score by Nelson Riddle (of Batman fame) is decent.  The screenplay by Leigh Brackett could have used some trimming, though.

Overall, a very good western that I recommend.  4 1/4 stars, rounded down to 4.",1453680000,,885,4.6688311688311686

Wayne's Cole Thornton isn't  as hard as John T Chance but Wayne's  authority  is evident  in  every  scene  he appears  in,  and that's about 90 percent in this one. Robert Mitchum, who plays the drunk here, is good as usual, even though he is not given much to do.  The role isn't  as well developed as Dean Martin's part in Bravo.  James Caan as Mississippi  is head and shoulder above Ricky Nelson's Colorado, the difference between  an actor and a singer.  Charlene Holt and Michele Carey as the female leads are nice to look at but don't  add up to one Angie Dickinson.  Overall, director Howard Hawks had enough that was new to put into this picture to make it fresh  and enjoyable.  I read in Todd McCarthy's book on Hawks that Leigh Brackett, who helped write both this one and Bravo, quoted  as saying she was suprised no one but a few film scholars caught the similarities between the two films.

Yes, the story isn't much, but who cares when the acting is so great. The humor stands out more than anything, and it's shared equally among the leads.

I'm very happy with the BluRay transfer, especially with the soundtrack, which is very clear and free of distortion. That's good, because it matches the good job they did on the visuals (not always the case - the soundtrack is often a disappointment on such reissues).

I could watch this every week and never get tired of it.

135661,5,0792110188,"This is one of the ""Dukes"" best westerns. Made in 1966 and directed by Howard Hawks, it is a near carbon copy of Rio Bravo made in 1959 and also directed by Howard Hawks. Watch these two movies and you'll see just how close the town, the plot, the characters and the Duke's characters follow  one another. They are both great movies and I can watch them over and over. The cinematography, sets, costumes, scripts and characters are so similar, but wait, same actor, director and location, Old Tucson. I''m sure there are other similarities, but if you're a fan of the Duke and want to see more after you've seen one of these, see the other. Blu-ray really brings them to life.

135712,4,0792110188,"A classic, watchable late-'60's Duke Wayne western, directed by Howard Hawks and made enjoyable by a familiar theme (it's essentially a remake of Hawk's 1959 ""Rio Bravo"") and cast -- Robert Mitchum,  James Caan, Arthur Hunnicutt, Christopher George, and Edward Asner.

Instead of the town sheriff he played in ""Rio Bravo,"" this time The Duke is a roving, aging gunfighter at first contracted (until he learns his true intentions and backs out) by an evil businessman (Asner) to help him clear out a family of ranchers who are blocking his land-grabbing aspirations.  Mitchum plays the town sheriff, a formidable old friend of The Duke's who has taken to drink and gone to seed (like Dean Martin's character in ""Rio Bravo"") over a woman, James Caan plays a young man The Duke meets on the trail, coaches in the ways of survival in the West, and follows him back to Mitchum's town to help out, Hunnicutt fills in the Walter Brennan part from ""Rio Bravo"" as Mitchum's jailhouse deputy, and George is a sinister but affable professional gunfighter Asner hires to take The Duke's place.

A very enjoyable and utterly predictable John Wayne film, one of his last, best westerns, with a great supporting cast.  Maybe not as iconic in the Wayne canon of westerns as ""Rio Bravo,"" but fun nonetheless.",1421020800,2,1291,4.85

135730,5,0792110188,"John Wayne is classic Americana.  He set the bar for American westerns early on, which of laid the trail for other greats such a Clint Eastwood, Sam Elliot, etc.  And for me personally one of the all time great classics of John Wayne is El Dorado.  This movie is just perfection.  John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are magic on the screen, a perfect pairing of ornery, cantankerous, mean as snake gunslingers who fight, drink and badger each other to point of hilarity, yet sticking by each other's side as they fight some of the toughest gunfighters who are trying to rob honest settlers of their livelihood.

Ed Asner plays a great role in this film as the dishonest land baron who is hiring gun hands to kill off his competition and steal lands that others have worked hard to get.  John Wayne is offered the job and finds out that the only thing standing between Asner and what he wants is a sheriff who used to be a great gunfighter but is now a town drunk (Robert Mitchum) and John Wayne's former riding partner.  Wayne goes back to find out the truth and along the way picks up James Caan, a young man with a mission to kill the men who murdered his mentor Johnny Diamond.  Caan's character, Mississippi, is deadly with a knife, but cant' shoot worth a darn, so Wayne gets him a double barrel sawed off shotgun, and the stage is set.  As Wayne nurses his old partner Mitchum back to health, there is so many fabulous lines and great gun fights that this movie is just as good as it gets for pure fun.  I have watched it over and over again and love it.  This is an absolute must if someone wants to see one of the truly classic John Wayne westerns.",1418169600,,1651,4.3452768729641695

135748,5,0792110188,"As always the Duke got'er done in fine fiddle.  I enjoy all of these Wayne films there were about five in this series and I have seen every one of them many times over,, grate story lines if not a bit obvious, yet always kept your attention and entertained his fans.  I sure miss the Duke he was the kind of movie star you could look up to.",1414972800,,340,3.985294117647059
135749,5,0792110188,"I agree with the vast majority of viewers that this is a very good film. John Wayne is an aged gun-fighter who is still very quick on the draw. He is offered a job by a cattle baron who wants to take over the ranch of a family that had it for some 20 years. He is talked out of taking the job by his old friend Robert Mitchum, which makes the cattle baron his enemy. He decides to help the rancher, but accidently kills the rancher's son, which, understandable strains his relationship. In fact, in revenge the dead man's sister shoots Wayne in the back. The bullet cannot be removed and it paralyses his shooting hand from time to time.
Mitchum had a bad experience and has become an alcoholic. He is also fast with the gun, but his condition obviously hinders him.
Wayne is joined by James Caan who is an expert knife-thrower, but totally inept with a gun.
When Wayne refuses the cattle baron, the cattle baron hires another gun fighter who is renowned as being very quick on the draw. He kills one of the hired guns men and angers him.
Wayne, Mitchum, and can will need to face the hired gun and his gang despite their disabilities.
The opening credits to this film show a host of paintings by Olaf Wieghorst that are beautiful.",1414540800,,1231,4.379912663755459
135750,5,0792110188,Great cast! Love most all of John Wayne's westerns. Robert Mitchum is always great no matter what the role. Well worth the $$ to see these two fine actors in the same film.,1414195200,,172,4.242424242424242
135751,5,0792110188,"This movie is a classic John Wayne Western, and just the right mix of action, drama, and humor. Add in Robert Mitchum and James Caan, and you simply can't go wrong. Of the trio of Howard Hawkes ""High Noon"" remakes (Rio Bravo, El Dorado, and Rio Lobo), this one is my favorite. It retains the classic good guy vs bad guy plot and humor of Rio Bravo, the characters are a little better developed. I found it easier to identify with James Caan's Mississippi (who can't shoot) than Ricky Nelson's  Colorado Ryan, for instance. And, the rescue mission aspect of El Dorado was a bit more developed and interesting to me than Rio Bravo's simple wait for the bad guys (a la High Noon).

For Parents:
1) This is a classic western shoot-em-up, and there is going to be violence. If you don't want to expose your kids to ANY type of violence, don't let them watch it. Otherwise, the values behind the violence are non-objectionable. The violence is essentially forced upon the good guys by the bad guys. And, the good guys only use violence to defend themselves and others from those bad guys. There are no gratuitous scenes of gore death. The killing is pretty clean.
2) There is little sex in this movie to worry about. The most risque thing was a scene where Charlene Holt's Maudie doesn't worry that John Wayne's Cole can see her night things, but then quickly closes her robe when she realizes Mississippi can see as well. I suppose some might find the wrestling match between Mississippi and Michelle Carey's Joey a bit off-color, but I think that is quite a stretch, really.
3) There is one scene where James Caan pretends to be Asian. Though the scene's point was not to make fun of Asian stereotypes, I can see how some might find it offensive, so just be aware.
4) Robert Mitchum's J P Harrah is a drunk for part of the movie, yet not apparently alcoholic, as he can go back to more restrained drinking once the fight is over. This isn't all that realistic, and you might want to explain addiction to your kids after they see this one.",1413849600,,2034,4.494594594594594

I wouldn't have got one anyway as Amazon.com won't refund unless you return the disc and won't pay for the postage so it's uneconomical to do so.

With not much cinematography to speak of, it relied on this chemistry for the movie. It also showed a rare vulnerability in a John Wayne character and he did quite well with it. With the action, drama, and quite a bit of humor it is an overall good watch. It probably isn't a five star movie but it rates a five star with me.",1404518400,,607,3.9836065573770494

This one has Wayne as the gunfighter turned sheriff, along with Robert Mitchum and a very young James Caan. It is the quintessential western in every way shape and in every form. Waynes fights the bad and even with a series of complications, wins. If you like the John Wayne western, this is one of those that is a definite must to watch. I gave it four stars because as said above, the movie runs on a formula used many times in John Wayne's movie's. But none the less it is still one of the great John Wayne's westerns.

The on-screen chemistry between Wayne and Robert Mitchum crackles and is a joy to watch. The supporting cast with James Caan (in his first major film role) Arthur Hunnicutt (a shining jewel in the cluster of brilliant character actors in Hollywood history) and even Ed Asner, Christopher George, et. al,. is spot on. The plot may seem familiar and derivative from Rio Bravo, the first of the ""let's hold up in the jail house"" pictures, but the performances coupled with the wry humor of the script overcome any lingering doubts. I first saw this years ago on it's theatrical release and am continually surprised by how well it translates to the home screen. The Blu-ray remastering is stunning.

135938,3,0792110188,"By the time this movie was made, Wayne had long established himself as a major star, especially in westerns like Stagecoach and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, which were very good, and The Searchers, which was pretty good.

When this film was made in 1966, traditional westerns were becoming pass with young people and the new thing in entertainment was the British invasion led by the Beatles.  But there was still an audience for westerns and this movie was obviously an attempt to cash in on Wayne's reputation for one more western.

Since all the basic western themes had already been exploited in Wayne's prior westerns and other westerns such as High Noon, this film had no choice but to employ new gimmicks to give the audience something different

So we end up with a slightly-pudgy and middle-aged John Wayne who can handle any situation and do improbable things despite having a bullet lodged in his back.  It also stars an also slightly-pudgy and middle-aged Robert Mitchum as well as a young James Caan.",1396310400,,1018,4.7942857142857145

135958,3,0792110188,"It's a buddy-movie really, in Western disguise, and like all good comedies, the tone tells you that all will be well. One of the few dark moments is the shooting by John Wayne's character, early in the movie and almost accidentally, of a young man from a family, the MacDonalds, with whom he forms an alliance in a range war against another family that is trying to run them off their land in order to get their water. Wayne plays Cole Thornton, a gun for hire, who refuses the employment of the rapacious Bart Jason (Ed Asner) to protect the family whose son he has killed. He is prompted to do it also by his old friend, now the sheriff of El Dorado, J. P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum). Thornton leaves El Dorado after being shot in the back by the sister of the young man he killed, and his wound is such that the bullet is too near his spine for the local doc to operate. He needs a real surgeon, because at unpredictable times he experiences paralysis in one arm as the embedded bullet affects him. However, before he gets to a surgeon he learns (a) that Bart Jason has hired another fast gun to intimidate the MacDonalds, and (b) that his old friend the sheriff, disappointed in love, has gone on an alcoholic bender and isn't fit to defend anybody. So Thornton heads back to El Dorado, with Mississippi, a young greenhorn he has met along the way (James Caan) -- and the story of the movie is how a ""greenhorn, a drunk, and a cripple"" take on the bad guys.

By 1966, Mitchum and Wayne were old hands at this, and their banter is easy-going, predictable and yet still humorous. The young James Caan plays his character slightly spacily, but he's no fool, even if he can't shoot straight -- it's a delightful performance. Charlene Holt, looking good in a corset, is Wayne's love-interest, the woman who will make him want to settle down, and Michelle Cary provides a sharp shot when it counts and catches the eye of Mississippi. Arthur Hunnicut has a nice turn as an aging deputy who still has his wits about him. There's lots of banter -- and the physical comedy of getting Mitchum to sober up. There's also quite a bit of killing in the old Western way -- not too much blood -- but the most violent part is Mitchum's revenge, with a butt of a rifle, on men who mocked him as a drunk -- just a few moments, but they seem to belong to a different movie. Lots of fun, then, with just enough tweaking of the genre (the partly-incapacitated heroes) to keep thing fresh. ""High Noon"" it ain't -- but it's very enjoyable.",1393545600,,2515,4.396995708154506

This movie is one of my favorites, because it is a classic western, with a little humor and a good story line.

There are a few minor issues:  Charlene Holt's (""Maudie"") acting is pretty iffy in a couple of places, the scene where James Caan dresses up like a Chinese man would never be tolerated today, and they have saguaro cactus in almost every outdoor scene (including what's supposed to be Texas), although Saguaro are only found in the Sonora Desert of southern Arizona and western Sonora, Mexico (in a couple of scenes, if you look carefully, you can tell the saguaro is a flat prop).  And as an owner of several firearms and a certified Range Safety Officer, it always makes me nervous when actors wave guns around, including at each other.

I know that it is basically the same movie, same plot as Rio Bravo and Rio Lobo but I think the pairing of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum works much better than either of the other pairings. A young James Caan is excellence. Humor, Action, a little romance, plus Western legends John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. What else could a classic Western ask for?",1389225600,,356,4.492307692307692
136015,5,0792110188,"This time Wayne chose Robert Mitchum as his co-star. This films general story is much akin to Rio Bravo but with different James Caan, in his first role or close to it, added excellent humor. I am a fan of the new Hawaii Five-0. Scott Caan sounds and acts exactly as his father does in El Dorado. Both excellent actors and fun to watch. As with the Horse Soldiers, an excellent theme song that tells of a dream most of us have shared. In addition, the paints at the beginning of the film of western life depict what the life of a cowboy. They were done by one of the minor players in the film. I will leave you to solve the mystery.",1389139200,,632,4.146341463414634

136017,5,0792110188,"This is a very good western.  It has action, some suspense, and good acting.  It is a pseudo comedy with quick one liners and characters that say just the right comment at the right time.  You have to watch to catch some of them, but it makes the movie that much more enjoyable.",1388966400,,278,4.2075471698113205

136019,5,0792110188,"With a couple of headliners like John Wayne and Robert Mitchum paying in an uncomplicated western movie, the film couldn't miss.
If you want to pick holes in the film you can, ie, the bad guys are always rotten shots. But let's face it you always want the good guys to win anyway. Plenty of shooting, plenty of scraps, with a dose of humour tossed in as well.  I rate this as good old fashioned entertainment without having your nose rubbed in blood and guts.",1388880000,,459,4.4
136020,1,0792110188,"In Rio Bravo (1959), Howard Hawks directs John Wayne as a sheriff who must hold a murder suspect in jail while awaiting the arrival of the U.S. Marshal. Wayne is aided by town drunk Dean Martin, who is a great gunfighter when sober, Ricky Martin, who is a great gunfighter but almost reluctant to get involved, Walter Brennan, who is an elderly deputy, and Angie Dickinson, who is a beautiful woman.

In El Dorado (1966) Howard Hawks directs John Wayne as a gunfighter who must hold a murder suspect in jail. Wayne is aided by sheriff drunk Robert Mitchum, who is a great gunfighter when sober, James Caan, who is a lousy gunfighter but anxious to get involved, Arthur Hunnicut, who is an elderly deputy, and Charlene Holt, who is a beautiful woman.

Dean Martin plays a much better drunk than does Robert Mitchum. Ricky Martin's great gunfighter is a better third banana in a western than is James Caan's lousy gunfighter. Walter Brennan and Arthur Hunnicut are neck and neck as are Angie Dickinson and Charlene Holt. And John Wayne is John Wayne.

Ten points to anyone who can explain why El Dorado was made, Rio Bravo being a much better movie.",1388707200,3,1147,4.640394088669951
136021,5,0792110188,"Guys,
This is a review of the blu-ray version of El Dorado,everyone knows the storyline so I won't go over that.
I bought El Dorado blu-ray from a Dutch company about 5/6 weeks ago,aye it,s been out over here for that amount of time,I could hardly wait till it was delivered,and when it was it went straight into my player,well,the picture/sound quality is excellent,sharp as a tack!!!so if any of you Guys are wondering about the quality of this blu-ray,dont worry,it,s well worth the price,and Amazon has it at a very fair price,pre-order,so don't hesitate,this blu-ray is a MUST-BUY for John Wayne/Western fans.
It does make me wonder though,why is it that European Country,s are far more advanced in their blu-ray releases of westerns??early next year France/Germany are releasing Chisum to blu-ray,they already have the like,s of Stagecoach,1966,Bandolero,Broken Arrow,and a FEW others on blu-ray,Germany is releasing Monte Walsh,Lee Marvin,early next year!!!!!!so what is going on in America??????? AND,where is The Shootist blu-ray??????????
There are very few western films being made just now,these old 50/60,s classics are treasures and should be given the blu-ray treatment!!!!
Cheers Guys,

While Wayne was the Sheriff in the original, Mitchum is here, a drunk getting over a failed romance (shades of Dean Martin's role in the original) and Wayne is the outsider who comes to the aid of his friend. An exceedingly affable outing for the two big stars with the introduction of a young James Cann as a young man bent on revenge who can't shoot a lick.

Although I received this at the same time as the Star Trek Original Series set, I had been busy watching the first two seasons of that for the last few weeks and decided to take a John Wayne break before starting Season Three so just last night watched ""El Dorado.""  I cannot believe I had never seen it before or at least I did not remember any of it though I thought I had seen it long ago on t.v.  I have a pretty nice collection of John Wayne movies,  and I had heard that ""El Dorado"" was kind of a re-make of my longtime favorite ""Rio Bravo.""  Although there were plenty of differences, there were also many parallels.  I thought John Wayne was much the same in both, but Robert Mitchum and James Caan were better than Dean Martin and Rick Nelson, it seemed to me , or their parts were bigger anyway.  I have watched ""Rio Bravo"" many times so I always know what is going to happen next, but with ""El Dorado"" everything was a surprise, which was fun.  It will also be fun to watch again, hopefully many times as well.",1381536000,,1043,4.206030150753769

It is filled with action and vengeance and yet it all feels so passive, so pedestrian.  Despite an all-star cast (I'm not the biggest fan of John Wayne, but James Caan and Robert Mitchum were almost always top notch) the film just feels so underwhelming.  The plot revolves around turf wars so-to-speak between rival ranchers, and Wayne, Mitchum and Caan join forces so that justice will prevail.  At a relaxed and generalized pace, the film plods along and tries to rouse interest but ultimately feels like a lukewarm variation of another film.  When you factor in the quality Westerns that were made in the 50's and 60's, and even the other Westerns made by Howard Hawks himself, you have to cringe a little to think that this was Hawks send off to the genre (he made one other film, three years later).",1379980800,3,931,4.517857142857143

Part of Howard Hawk's trilogy (Rio Bravo, Rio Lobo) that came in response to ""High Noon"", this is 2nd behind Rio Bravo but still studded with excellence. From the beginning title score composed by Nelson Riddle and sung by George Alexander, with artwork by the western genre master Olaf Wieghorst (who has a cameo in the picture) in the background is perhaps the best western commencement in film history. The plot follows a sheriff (Robert Mitchum), a gunslinger (John Wayne), and a young stud (James Caan) going against the troops of a corrupt cattle baron (Ed Asner), they confront the lopsided odds against them with grit and efficiency.

Gunslinger Cole Thornton (John Wayne) rides into town to meet with rancher Bart Jason (Edward Asner). On the way he meets up with an old friend of his, J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) who is now sheriff of El Dorado. Harrah tells Thornton that Jason is trying to drive another rancher, Kevin Macdonald (R.G.

In return, Macdonald's daughter, Josephine (Michele Carey), shoots Thornton and leaves him with a debilitating injury. Some months later, Thornton meets up with another man, Mississippi (James Caan), who is also intent up avenging the death of his friend. Jason has hired another gunslinger, Nelse McLeod (Christopher George), to fight his battles.

Personally, I think this one rates right up there with the best of them. Well written, tightly directed, beautiful cinematography and a great cast including Robert Mitchum and James Caan. Though the film is sometimes considered a direct remake of director Howard Hawks' 1959 movie, Rio Bravo, especially as the plots have so many overlapping themes, I agree with Hawks himself who always asserted they were similar but different. The themes in this one mirror much more closely 1960s values as opposed to 1950s, including feisty strong and independent women (beautiful too); blurring lines between good and evil (Christopher George as the master gunfighter Mccloud is superb as he exhibits ""professional courtesy""); and an overall more easygoing flowing style including the fun bantering dialogue. A fine film, hugely underrated and well worth seeing.",1369008000,,1043,5.365853658536586

This is the best one of the three - my opinion of course - but they are all very good. This is also one of Wayne's best performances in a formula Western...in fact formula Westerns don't get much better than this one. All three Westerns in the aforementioned trilogy have similarities and this one has so many similarities to ""Rio Bravo"" that it's virtually a remake. But it is the differences between the two that make El Dorado a better movie than Rio Bravo. Each film features a drunken sheriff, but Robert Mitchum's performance is much better and more convincing than Dean Martin's in ""Rio Bravo"". Likewise James Caan (playing a similar role) is by far a better actor than Rick Nelson in ""Rio Bravo""....Nelson got the role more for his ability to draw teens to the theatre than for any acting ability. Only the sidekick character, Walter Brennan as Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"" gets the nod over Arthur Hunnicutt as Bull...but not by much. In the female lead, Angie Dickenson and Charlene Holt are toss-ups. But make no mistake, Wayne is the star, dominating the screen time and appearing in virtually every scene. If you've seen and liked the other two films in this trilogy, you will love this one. Likewise, if you're a John Wayne fan, youll want to see it too and probably add it to your library...this is Wayne at his best! My highest recommendation.",1365120000,,1520,4.612546125461255

Thorntons old friend, sheriff J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) stops to pay his old buddy a visit, informing him that the whole arrangement isn't kosher, and that it would inevitably pit them against each other. Wisely, Thornton passes the job, but still manages to receive a crippling, wounded by a headstrong member of theMcDonald family (played the beautiful Michele Carey) in the process.
Some months later, Thornton meets up with a young greenhorn called Mississippi (James Caan) who is out to settle a debt with a scar-faced scoundrel by the name of McLeod. Smoothing things out as best he can before the shit really hits the fan, Thornton learns that McLeod has filled the post he himself left behind. Worse still, our aging hero discovers that his old pal Harrah has since become an inveterate alcoholic, and that he would be no match against McLeod and his men. And so, Thornton andMississippi head back to El Dorado to sober Harrah up (leading to one of the funniest moments in film) and to take on the bad guys. Arthur Hunnicutt turns in a memorable performance as Harrahs ornery horn-tooting deputy Bull and Charlene Holt is on hand as the platonic love interest for both of the old cowboys.
Say hello to a brilliant breakout performance by young James Caan as Alan Bourdillion Mississippi Traherne, and the great Christopher George as the sinister McLeod.
 The new High-Def 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation has never looked better, with very little debris to distract the viewer whatsoever and a color schematic that is well-balanced.

In El Dorado, he is teamed with another giant of the era, Robert Mitchum, the up-and-coming young actor James Caan, and character actors Arthur Honeycutt and Ed Asner, to produce a fun movie.  While the plot is typical (good guys vs bad guys) and very much like a previous Wayne classic, Rio Bravo, El Dorado is entertaining and fun to watch.  Over the past 40 years, we have been so bombarded by profanity and sexual situations on the big screen, it is fun to watch a movie where there is none of either.  You can watch it in complete comfort whether watching with your kids or your mother.  Is El Dorado the best film The Duke ever made?  No...but the mix of characters and a good plot combine to produce, what I like to call, ""a fun movie with a predictable outcome.""

One is a feat of horsemanship: the Duke, not a stunt man, put his horse into reverse to back out of a dangerous situation.  Another is the facility of the Big Mitch in portraying the state of psychoemotional degeneracy that his character had gotten into as a depressed drunk. Young James Kahn plays an amusing character; you can see that his freedom to express is limited because he is a newbie just being introduced, yet he manages to essay a couple of sensitive or creative expressions of his otherwise two-dimensional role, intended as a foil for John and Robert.

Robert Mitchum and Wayne - too much testosterone to jam into the frame. As always good looking women sprinkled around to hang on our heroes. Kind of a throwback movie but really a hoot if you go for a great old western every now and again.",1362787200,,653,4.232

136164,4,0792110188,"El Dorado (1967) is an unabashed remake of the 1959 film Rio Bravo.  Both films are directed by Howard Hawkes, and I have to wonder what his motivations are for directing two movies that are almost identical replicas of each other?  Hawkes did not change too much in the remake, so perhaps based on the success of Rio Bravo, Hawkes just wanted another successful payday.  In any event, both movies were successful, and it is still debated to this day which is the better movie.  Rio Bravo has Wayne as Sheriff (J.T. Chance) with drunken deputy Dean Martin, crusty old deputy Walter Brennan, and handsome singing sensation Ricky Nelson as Colorado (a hired gunslinger).  El Dorado has Wayne as a hired gun helping a drunken sheriff, (Robert Mitchum), a crusty old deputy in Arthur Hunnicutt, and handsome youngster in James Caan (as Mississippi).  The plots are almost exactly the same.  The sheriff decides to hold up inside the jail house with his prisoner and wait for help from the federal marshal.  There is the same joke about the drunk taking a bath (Martin and Mitchum), and there is the 'let's take a turn around the town"" sequence where an exciting gunfight breaks out.  Both films have a bar scene where the drunken lawman has to redeem himself.  Both films also conclude with a final climatic gunfight. In Rio Bravo, Angie Dickenson is cast as the sexy female lead, and in El Dorado, Charlene Holt gets the role. Both films had the same screenwriter as well.

The movie rating site, Rotten Tomatoes, gives El Dorado 7.9 stars and Rio Bravo 8.2 stars.  Both films are truly enjoyable, and both have their share of excitement and laughs. Rio Bravo has a more laid back feel to it, where El Dorado seems the more driven film.  The bottom line is that both films are rated high by the audience in terms of enjoyment.

Any fan of Wayne will want to see both films.  If I had to pick my favorite, it would certainly be a toss-up, both are about equal on my scale.  Both have action and laughs, and make for a fun experience for all.

136234,3,0792110188,"To say that this is a ""typical"" John Wayne film of the 1960s is not to say anything bad about it. Imagine, if you will, that you are a Hollywood producer in, say, 1966. (This one was made in 1966, released in 1967.) You have a character in the script that would be good for John Wayne. But so do hundreds of others; he's a big (physically and economically) star, and he's capable of playing essentially any character for whom a husky 6'4"" male is appropriate. So Wayne gets to pick and choose, and he did a pretty good job. This is one such job.

Wayne plays Cole Thornton, gunfighter with a conscience. He hires out, true, but he picks and chooses -- like Wayne himself does about movies. So when he arrives in El Dorado and his old friend the sheriff (Robert Mitchum) tells him what sort of crook he's been hired to fight for, and what good people he's expected to go against, he decides he doesn't want the job. So he goes out to the cattle baron who had hired him (Ed Asner, who's good at being the bad guy boss) and gives him back what's left of the expense money he has advanced.

But the McClouds (the good people) don't know he's turned down the job until after the youngest son shoots at him and gets killed, and the youngest girl shoots Cole in the back and gives him a problem. Turns out the bullet lodged near his spine, and periodically pinches a nerve and paralyzes his right arm. His shooting arm.

The doc says he doesn't have the skill to remove it, but Cole should get it out as soon as he finds a sufficiently skilled surgeon. And of course, Cole puts it off. He's so macho.

Then he meets Allen Badillion Traherne. Call him Mississippi; he was born on a riverboat, and raised by Johnny Diamond, a gambler. Diamond was killed by a gang of four, and Mississippi has been tracking them down and challenging them. Apparently unarmed, he goes into the saloon where Cole is waiting for his dinner to be ready and challenges the fourth murderer. When the killer goes for his gun, Mississippi reaches behind his neck and tosses a knife that goes directly into the center of the killer's chest.

So Mississippi is at odds, having completed avenging Johnny Diamond, and decides to follow Cole to the town of El Dorado. Asked how he knew Cole was headed for El Dorado, he explains that he saw the look on Cole's face when a guy in the saloon said that the sheriff had turned into a drunk. Finally, Cole accepts Mississippi as a traveling partner, and takes him to a gunsmith who sells him a gun that looks exactly like a sawed-off shotgun, though they never call it that. He said it was previously owned by a man with poor eyesight who used to just shoot at the sound of a voice. Eventually, he killed the wrong guy and they hung him.

I won't go through the entire plot, but it has enough unexpected twists to keep the audience guessing about how Ed Asner will be defeated. Since it's John Wayne, we know he will be defeated, but he'll keep you guessing as to how it's all going to happen.",1337126400,,2999,4.355992844364938

136254,2,0792110188,"""El Dorado"" might more aptly be called ""El Gordos"" as the two stars are clearly over weight and out of shape in this 1967 Howard Hawks film. Or you might call it ""El Doublo"" since the film is clearly a remake of the far superior ""Rio Bravo"" (1959) that also starred Wayne and was produced/directed by Hawks and written by Leigh Brackett.

In this film, Wayne plays a deputy sheriff to his old friend Robert Mitchum and he is assisted by a young man (James Caan) who is nick-named after a state (Mississippi) and a grouchy old man (Arthur Hunnicutt). They are besieged in a small town jail because they hold land-grabbing Ed Asner who is responsible for ordering a man's death. The gang is led by gunslinger Christopher George. Mitchum plays a drunk. There is a half hearted romance involving Charlene Holt.

In Rio Bravo Dean Martin plays the drunk and the deputy and Wayne is now the sheriff. They are besieged in a small town because they are holding the brother (Claude Akins) for murdering a man. Akins is the brother of a land-grabbing rancher (John Russel). Wayne and Martin are assisted by a grumpy old man (Walter Brennan) and a young man (Ricky Nelson) who is nick-named after a state (Colorado). There is a half hearted romance involving Angie Dickinson.

FWIW - Wayne wanted to play the Sheriff in ""El Dorado"" but Hawks wanted  Mitchum.

We think of Howard Hawks (1896-1977) as a Western director, but in truth, Hawks made all kinds of films, including comedies, gangster and war films. He was nominated 3 times for a DGA award for ""Red River"" (1948), ""The Big Sky"" (1952) and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959) and he was Oscar nominated for ""Sergeant York"" (1941). Among his other notable films were ""Scarface"" (1932), ""The Big Sleep"" (1946), and ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"" (1953).

Leigh Brackett (1915-78) was a science fiction writer who also worked on screenplays. She was nominated by WGA for her work on ""Star Wars V"". She worked with Hawks on ""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"", Rio Lobo"",  and ""Hatari"". She said - ""When I write a novel I am God at my own typewriter and there is nobody in between. But when I write a screenplay it must be a compromise because there are so many elements which are outside the writer's province.""

It's hard to believe that Hawks and Wayne made ""Red River"" (1948) when you watch this film. There is very little in this film that will attract anyone. Christopher George is a villain only in name. We see nothing to convince us that he is dangerous, so when he is gunned down by a crippled Wayne falling out of a buck wagon, who cares? And Ed Asner hardly evokes any fear or awe.

In 1967 the top grossing films were ""The Jungle Book"", ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", and ""The Dirty Dozen"". Oscars went to ""In the Heat of the Night"" (Picture, Actor), ""The Graduate"" (Director), and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (Actress). Other notable films that year were ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Camelot"", ""I am Curious Yellow"", ""To Sir With Love"", and ""Point Blank""

Westerns released in 1967 included ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", ""Hombre"", ""Hour of the Gun"", ""Welcome to Hard Times"", and ""The War Wagon"".

136259,5,0792110188,"I really like both these movies by the Duke. ""El Dorado"" is another of his westerns where he is a gunfighter that works for the good guys. ""El Dorado"" has a lot of time spans between several of the scenes which lets the viewer know 6 months or so has passed since last scene. There are actors who are a lot of the old guys that have the usual small parts, like Johnny Crawford of ""Rifleman"" fame who Wayne ""accidentally"" shoots, Bruce Cabot, a long time co-star, Paul Fix also of ""Rifleman"" fame, Charlene Holt - Wayne's hottie girlfriend, Arthur Hunnicut, James Caan (co-star) - we know where he has been since 1966, and Michelle Carey - one of Elvis's love interests at one time, and Ed Asner (co-star) is the bad guy, along with Christopher George - of ""The Rat Patrol"" fame.
In this movie Robert Mitchum is the Sheriff that John Wayne describes as ""a star with at drunk pinned to it"" for a very good reason. You know the plot, the sheriff gets the hots for some wandering petticoat and she drops him like the proverbial hot potatoe and he crawls inside the bottle for consolation.
Needless to say, Duke succeeds in helping Mitchum ""dry out"" and get his head back together while fighting the hired guns who give the town a lot of trouble, not to say the McDonald family.
I always enjoy the westerns of John Wayne and this one is no exception. I really like the musical score, scored and conducted by Nelson Riddle, with its recurring theme and the ""oh crap"" music when something unexpected happens, like when Michelle Carey's character ambushes the Duke after shooting her little brother, Johnny Crawford.

136266,4,0792110188,"Released in 1967, Howard Hawks' ""El Dorado"" is an obvious reworking of his 1959 hit ""Rio Bravo,"" both starring John Wayne, yet ""El Dorado"" is not a remake, as some claim.

The similarities are undeniable: Both films were shot in Old Tucson, Arizona (substituting for West Texas); both feature the same four general protagonists with John Wayne in the starring role, although he's not the Sheriff in this one; both involve the four protagonists staving off owlhoots intent on freeing a prisoner from the town jail (in this case, played by Edward Asner); and both feature a beautiful saloon-type female. Other than that these are different stories altogether with different characters.

Of the two I prefer ""El Dorado."" It's more eventful and less of an Old West soap opera and is therefore more accessible to the average viewer. ""Rio Bravo"", by contrast, is a unique cult Western; it has its own special vibe and the viewer has to adjust to appreciate it. Plus ""Rio Bravo"" is (naturally) more dated compared to ""El Dorado."" It seems like Hawks learned a thing or two from the less traditional Westerns put out in the 60s starting with Brando's outstanding ""One-Eyed Jacks"" in 1961, the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western.

POSITIVES:

- ""El Dorado"" features a really good old Western tune during the opening credits. - Although ""El Dorado"" primarily takes place in the titular town (actually Old Tucson) there are quite a number of scenes that take place elsewhere, unlike ""Rio Bravo"" where the entire story takes place in the town. - Robert Mitchum is arguably better than Dean Martin as the drunkard; maybe because acting was his primary profession. - James Caan (father of Scott Caan) is superior to Ricky Nelson as the younger sidekick/deputy. Caan has a likable charisma whereas Nelson was okay but bland by comparison. Like the Mitchum/Martin comparison this may be due to the fact that Caan is an actor by profession rather than a singer trying to act. - Charlene Holt is arguably superior to Angie Dickinson. They both have ""Whoa, Mama"" boudoir scenes; compare for yourself. - ""El Dorado"" has two prominent babes whereas ""Rio Bravo"" only had one. Michele Carey stands out as the rancher's shapely daughter Joey. - There's great camaraderie between the main protagonists, particularly Wayne & Caan and Wayne & Mitchum. - Lastly, Arthur Hunnicutt is superior to the annoying Walter Brennan in the similar role.

NEGATIVES:

- The first half is better than the second half wherein the story settles down to events in the town, mostly at the Sheriff's office/jail. - In the second half the characters come off more cartoonish & stagy than real at times. This was a flaw that was being worked out of the Western in the 60s as verified by more reality-based films like ""One-Eyed Jacks"" and ""Duel at Diablo."" This problem was largely removed from Hawks' last (sort of) reworking of ""Rio Bravo,"" 1970's ""Rio Lobo"", but not completely purged. - There's some real eye-rolling dialogue between Cole Thorton (Wayne) and the gunslinger played by Christopher George. They talk about the four (or so) fastest quick draws in the West and wonder who's faster between the two of 'em. It's juvenile & cartoony and, needless to say, totally unrealistic.

FINAL WORD: ""El Dorado"" is an entertaining John Wayne Western. It has that special 'something' that makes it click, particularly the first half before it takes the quasi-""Rio Bravo"" route. Robert Mitchum, James Caan, Charlene Holt and Michele Carey are exceptional co-stars.

There are actually two commentaries on the DVD and while they do include some interesting facts about the movie, the actors and the director, as you listen it becomes obvious that neither of the commentators are terribly great fans of this movie.  They both spend a lot of time ""damning with faint praise"" or comparing the film unfavorable to the director's other movies (in particular the very similar&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rio-Bravo/dp/B000O599WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rio Bravo</a>).  I think their choice for this set was a mistake, as I would think most people would not care to listen to two ""experts"" pan the movie they just purchased.

(Personally, I find El Dorado much superior to Rio Bravo, if for no other reason that a far superior supporting cast.  Robert Mitchum is a far better actor than Dean Martin, and even the young James Caan is far preferable to teen idol turned ""actor"", Ricky Nelson.)

In the end, I think this ""Centennial Collection"" release would make a fine addition to the video library of most fans of either Wayne or Hawks.",1275091200,2,2312,6.281645569620253

136275,4,0792110188,"El Dorado has its considerable charms, not least for the partnership of the Duke and Robert Mitchum, plus the addition of a very young James Caan, as a roving gambler named Mississippi with irregular taste in headgear - who is also absolutely hopeless with firearms. (Ed Asner is also featured, as is Christopher George, as an ice-cold villain.) All of these characters are in service to a plot which generally was done over and over - and by Howard Hawks at least three times ( Rio Bravo and as Rio Lobo being the other two iterations.) It's all very familiar, and as my daughter remarked, very much as if ""Blazing Saddles"" had thrown up all over ""Silverado"". Two old pals, plus a young whippersnapper and a crusty sidekick, find themselves on one side of a range war, out of a sense of honor and obligation to old friends. This all takes place in the classic never-never land of the Old West, sometime during indeterminate post-Civil War era, in a town with dusty streets, and wooden sidewalks shaded by the porches of plank-built businesses in Victorian style, where the sound of a rinky-dink upright piano spills out between the batwing swinging doors of a saloon. The women are feisty and fearless; in the case of one character, she goes the extra mile and wears trousers and shoots as well as any of her brothers. The dialog is snappy and character-driven; in one exchange, Robert Mitchum's character asks ""What in hell are you doin' here"" and the Duke growls, ""I'm lookin' at a tin star with a drunk pinned on it."" El Dorado is basically your generic John Wayne Western - but it boasts a top-notch cast, all of whom seemed to be having a thoroughly marvelous time - and there are much, much, much worse DVD movies out there to watch on a rainy Saturday evening.

There are the usual extravagant extras included in this release, of which only a vintage feature called the Artist and the American West is memorable.",1269043200,,1920,4.647058823529412
136276,5,0792110188,Both movies are very good and I would highly recommend this double feature of John Wayne to anyone wanting to pickup a good western and adventure film.,1268265600,,151,4.62962962962963
136277,4,0792110188,"The town drunk - a disgraced lawman; a young punk who thinks he's ""all that""; an old fart given to countrified aphorisms - and the tough-guy Duke, beloved of all the ladies and apparently unstoppable no matter what happens to him. Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO of course - or maybe not. It's the conventional wisdom that both this film and RIO LOBO four years later are just thinly-disguised remakes by the same director of the 1959 film which has become a beloved classic. But plot was never all that central to Hawks' films, and the mere fact that John Wayne is not playing the sheriff, and Robert Mitchum as the drunk is actually the man who is supposed to be in charge ought to be enough to show that EL DORADO is aiming in a slightly different direction.

Wayne is Cole Thornton, a gunslinger who seems to have managed to largely stay friendly with - or at least not make enemies of - the law in his career. He's come into the town of El Dorado to take a job with Bart Jason (Edward Asner), but before he can accept it his old sometime-friend Sheriff Harrah (Robert Mitchum) gives him the lowdown - that Jason is a no-good land thief and he's trying to drive the other big ranchers in the area, the MacDonalds, out by force. Thornton doesn't take the job, but as he's leaving the area he's forced to shoot a young member of the MacDonalds who fires on him, and is in turn shot by Joey MacDonald (Michele Carey). The El Dorado ""doctor"" can't remove the bullet, and Cole takes off, ostensibly to get fixed up.

Which he never does, however, instead befriending a young knife-throwing kid, Mississippi (James Caan, 26 and in one of his first major roles) and having a wary conversation with Nelse McLeod (Christopher George) who it turns out is planning to take the job for Jason that Cole turned down. Cole, stung by guilt feelings over killing a MacDonald, decides to return to El Dorado when he hears that the sheriff has gone around the bend with drink, and allows the punk kid to come along, trying to teach him to shoot along the way. Back in town, he finds himself taking charge of the situation when Harrah proves essentially useless, and eventually the semi-sobered-up sheriff, the gunslinger with the bad back, the punk kid and the elderly ex-Indian fighter deputy Bull (a superb Arthur Hunnicutt) end up having to keep the captured Jason in jail, all the while fending off his men including the fast-draw McLeod.

Of course, like most if not all of Hawks' films, EL DORADO is mostly about male camaraderie at heart, but the form that takes is a little different from the previous film, and the focus is if anything even more on the relationships, the dialogue, the fun and games than on getting to the climax of the film - which ends up feeling very anticlimactic, even perfunctory, when we do reach it. In the earlier version of this story (partially written, like this film, by the great Leigh Brackett) Wayne's John Chance is the leader from the beginning - the sheriff and the most competent man. Eight years later, with an older Duke and a paunchy Mitchum playing both the lead lawman and the Dean Martin drunkard role, it's a more level playing field. Hunnicutt's Bull is also far more competent than his analogue in the earlier film played by Walter Brennan. Interestingly enough the kid played by Caan here recites poetry; Ricky Nelson of course sang.

So there are just as many differences as overt similarities; what they add up to is a film that is more about slightly shifting but more equal power dynamics, friendships that are a little easier-going and dialogue that is more witty than tough. The youth of the kid - and the women in the film - are deemphasized, the age and infirmities of the other main characters are a little more obvious. I suppose it ends up feeling like an ""old man's film"", a more relaxed and ""fun"" piece of work, and so it unsurprisingly lacks somewhat in narrative drive.  RIO BRAVO, and Hawks' earlier RED RIVER managed to fit the dynamics of the conversational and the confrontational together a little more smoothly, and as funny and low-key as they are at times still manage to have rousing conclusions. As beautifully put-together as this film is - and I should mention in particular Harold Rosson's gorgeous burnished autumnal cinematography - EL DORADO doesn't quite get there, but the journey is fun just the same.

I have the earlier version of the DVD, which is no-frills except for the trailer, but the transfer is excellent and I have no complaints really.  This is one of the best late films for both director and costars Wayne and Mitchum and I'd certainly say it's a must for fans of any or all of them.",1267401600,3,4664,4.591836734693878

i may be young but i know good actors when i watch them on screen these two played beautifully off each other and so did another great actor James Caan

all the characters were played to perfection, even though anyone can play an alcoholic sheriff with a broken-heart Mitchum really made the role shine, of course John Wayne did wonderful as The Hired Gun, but my favorite role was that of Mississipi played by James Caan, in my opinion he did an astonishing job in this role and the scenes with him and Wayne were glorious.

in a lil side note the action scenes were done really well and there was also a slight editing issue during one of the scenes I'm sure you'll notice(but you must take into consideration the time when the movie was made)

thank you and you really must see this movie that could never be done today due to the fight between stars in leading roles.",1255824000,3,1227,4.321739130434783
136282,4,0792110188,"From time to time I've revisited this movie. Entertaining it is.
""El Dorado"" has its hokey moments, James Caan going on and on about ""ride boldly ride"" in a poem about El Dorado, Maudie (John Wayne's love interest) taking up where numerous women in Wayne's movies have left off: ""I'm not going to cry. I'm just going to buy a pine box, about 6-foot for you"" and then the requisite speech about how men are dumb for fighting and women are saintly for waiting valiently for their men to come back home, blah, blah blah.
It has has a geezer sidekick (Arthur Honeycutt)who mimics Walter Brennen from ""Rio Bravo,"" James Caan who mimics Ricky Nelson from ""Rio Bravo"" and Mitchum who mimics Dean Martin from ""Rio Bravo"" and, finally, Charlene Holt, who mimics Angie Dickinson in ""Rio Bravo."" See the pattern? ""Rio Bravo"" and ""El Dorado"" are essentially the same movie. A sheriff, his sidekick and John Wayne, his sidekick and his girlfriend. Formulaic.

Nonetheless, there is a good movie in here.
There are elements of Wild Woolly Westerns here.
Christopher George plays the bad guy gunslinger who nonetheless warms up to John Wayne's Cole Thornton and SPOILER ALERT! gets it in the end.
But there is a scene that is gold: George and his band of bad men walk into the bar to see the other bad guy/rancher Edward Asner.
As they walk in, tinkly piano music plays and they swagger in. It's straight out of a 1920s shoot-em-up.

It's not a work of art. But it will entertain. It will grow on you with subsequent showings.
John Wayne is the ultimate John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is pretty much a bystander and goes through the motions.

All in all, entertaining and a poem to formula Cowboy movies.",1252540800,3,1701,4.644518272425249

All parts of the movie provide fun and the old belief that the good guy should win and get the pretty girl.

Kudos to Paramount for doing a first rate job on this one.  Although the movie itself may not qualify for classic status, it's great entertainment and, for my money, a better picture than its previous incarnation as ""Rio Bravo.""

Being an owner of the previous releases and a huge fan of the movie (probably in the minority who favor it to Rio Bravo)as far as the movie goes it looks stunning! The picture is crisp, the contrast brilliant and the color well saturated. If I didn't  know better I'd think it was a VistaVision.  The Second disc has some very entertaining and educational featurettes which kept me amused for over an hour themselves. James Caan is great  in the film, Mitchum  is ....Mitchum ..which is superb and Ed Asner brings a gravitas to his character.  Oh...John Wayne is terrific and this is just a lot of fun.

I picked up the ""import"" version without the extras but have the domestic one on order, I hear scuttle butt the import may have a slightly better picture in that the domestic may be a tad over processed for the super picky, I'll update after an AB test. Every frame of this film is so beautiful it could be printed and hung on a wall, and the fact that so much is shot at night enables the cinematographer (Rosson) to do beautiful work and make it look like each scene is lit with found lighting, not your TV lighting at all!  For me I prefer this to Rio Bravo as I believe Mitchum clearly outclasses Dean Martin and James Caan is far superior to Ricky Nelson ...they've kept the major bonus feature from the 2 DVD set so unlike many re releases on BR we get all the goodies.. a great movie in my collection just moved from Gold to Diamond for me!!",1244073600,69,1771,4.281437125748503
136286,5,0792110188,"In 1966, popular director Harold Hawks (1932's ""Scarface"", 1938's ""Bringing Up Baby"" and 1940's ""His Girl Friday"") known for directing popular romantic comedies back in the 1930's and 1940's returned with his second western titled ""El Dorado"".

Although Hawks was not a specialist in the Western genre, his film ""Rio Hondo"" was critically acclaimed and so, when he created his second Western ""EL DORADO"" (as part of his Western trilogy) eventually, his second film would be known for the unique pairing of western greats John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.  Two stars that would guarantee ""EL DORADO"" to become a box office hit.

The film also would feature actor James Caan, Ed Asner, Arthur Hunnicutt and actresses Charlene Holt and Michele Carey.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

If there is one thing to say about the Paramount ""CENTENNIAL COLLECTION"" releases, many of these classic films have all been digitally remastered and look absolutely magnificent.  These films containing the ""CENTENNIAL COLLECTION"" moniker are the definitive versions to own as they tend to have more features added and overall, like how CRITERION COLLECTIONS have spotlighted on films worldwide and have given top treatment, Paramount has done the same with several of their classic films.  With that being said, I can only wish that a Blu-ray high definition transfer is in the works for these classic films because if they have been through a process of remastering, one can only expect how phenomenal these will look via HD.

For now, ""EL DORADO - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION"" is only available via DVD but this new version is remastered, in widescreen and features Dolby Digital audio.

The picture quality for a DVD is actually quite clean for a film nearly 40-years-old.  The film utilizes a good number of outdoor shots and video looks quite clean for an older film.

For audio, I tested the audio on my receiver set at ""Dolby Digital Mono"".  What can I say....the gunshots really come alive in the sound department.  Granted, the film is primarily dialogue-based but I realized how pronounced those gun and rifle shots sound on my home theater system.

Overall, ""EL DORADO"" has been given special treatment and fans of the film will not be disappointed.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""EL DORADO"" is rather a fun, action film that knows when to balance its seriousness with its humor.  On one side of the spectrum, you get movie greats John Wayne and Robert Mitchum together.  But on the other side, it's about character development which ""EL DORADO"" is very much strong in showcasing.

The film features two legendary actors in their own right but then you start adding more talent such as James Caan as Mississippi, a character that brings the comedic element to the film.  And then you have two beautiful women, Charlene Holt (Maudie) and Michele Carey (Joey MacDonald) who are women that are not weak, in fact they are independent thinkers who do things on their own. Considering that women were not exactly featured in equal footing,  to see these women as strong and independent, this was quite rare in a film created at that time, especially for a Western.

Overall, ""EL DORADO"" was an entertaining, humorous but really enjoyable Western.  I absolutely enjoyed the scene as Cole and Mississippi make a concoction to help the sheriff sober up and then you have scenes where Mississippi goes to check on a shooter that is hiding near the sheriff's station (which turns out to be Joey) and he tries to apprehend her.  And of course, the natural banter between Wayne and Mitchum that seem natural and real.

This is the first Western release for the ""CENTENNIAL COLLECTION"" and is #9 in the series.  The DVD actually provides some interesting tidbits as Director Peter Bogdanovich who was good friends with Hawk, was at the set during the filming and is able to give his personal insight about Hawks and the various talent for the film.  So, Western fans will definitely find some enjoyment with what is included on the two discs. There is a good number of special features that will definitely keep the viewer busy for a few hours.

Overall, ""EL DORADO"" is an enjoyable Western.  Definitely not as superb as ""RIO HONDO"" but because the film manages to effectively use the talents of John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, James Caan and Charlene Holt effectively, made this film quite appealing.  If you are a John Wayne or Robert Mitchum fan or even a fan of this classic 1966 film, definitely check out ""EL DORADO - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION"".  This is the definitive version to own on DVD!",1243641600,11,7537,4.855015673981192
136287,5,0792110188,"I fell in love with this film the first time I saw it in the movies.  From the marvelous theme song (sung by George Alexander and the Mello Men) to the conclusion of Wayne and Mitchum hobbling down the street on crutches, it is marvelously entertaining from start to finish.
Basically Hawks remaking his classic ""Rio Bravo"" and while not as great as that film, it is fun nonetheless.  Wayne and Mitchum as predictably great.  Arthur Hunnicutt is terrific as deputy Bull Harris, his wonderful laconic delivery of every line makes it memorable.  Like the fantastic Walter Brennan as Stumpy the deputy in ""Rio Bravo"" (Brennan should have won a best supporting actor oscar for that film,) Hunnicutt is great as well.  A very young James Caan is also fun as ""Misissippi,"" a slightly different version of the Ricky Nelson ""Colorado"" in ""Bravo""  (Colorado was a fast gun, Mississippi cannot shoot at all.)  Good support from Michele Carey, Charlene Holt and Christopher George.  A nice soundtrack from once of Sinatra's favorite arrangers and conductor, Nelson Riddle.
This film is one of my favorite Wayne westerns, like Rio Bravo I never tire of it.  One of my favorite Howard Hawks films as well.
I bought it years ago on DVD.  Now that Paramount is finally releasing a deluxe edition, I will probably be buying it again.  I'm only sorry that are not releasing it on blu-ray.

Harrah (Robert Mitchum) greets Cole Thornton (John Wayne) with a pointed rifle... Harrah has heard his friend works now for Bart Jason (Edward Asner). Thornton admits Jason offered him good money but he doesn't know what he has to do to earn it...

Harrah explains that Jason showed up here around the end of the war with a pocketful of money and nobody could find out where he got it, but everybody else around here was broke... Having money, he started to grow... But now he needs more water... There's only one place to get it... Trouble is somebody was there ahead of him, about 20 years ahead... His name is Kevin MacDonald (R. G. Armstrong).

MacDonald got four boys and a girl... All worked real hard... They hung together through the rough times and how things were looking up, MacDonald was not ready to sell... So he's holding and Jason was pushing, and the sheriff was standing right in the middle...

Warned that Thornton has gone to Jason's, MacDonald has left his youngest boy out there to do a man's job... He went to sleep... When Cole came by, Luke (Johnny Crawford) woke up, jumped up and started firing his gun... All Cole was seeing was somebody shooting at him from the rocks... Thornton, thinking himself the target, shoots and drops the boy ... Luke explains the error then... To escape the pain of his mortal wound, he kills himself...

Thornton takes his body to his fathers' place, and after he explains what happened, his sister, Joey (Michele Carey), a wild cat in buckskin pants who didn't believe him, tried to kill him... Her brother stops her and her father asks her to get in the house...

After Thornton leaves the ranch, Joey (Michele Carey) ambushes Cole at a creek, dropping him with her riffle bullet... He manages to get back on his horse and escapes to Maudie's place, where Doc Miller (Paul Fix) treats him... The bullet was dangerous up against his spine, however, as Doc advises him to find a better surgeon for the bullet's removal...

After a short time, Thornton leaves El Dorado...

One of the best moments in the film came in a Cantina near the Mexican border when James Caan (Mississippi) enters the place and calls one of four men sitting at a dinner table, reminding him if he remembers him or if he remembers the blue hat he is wearing? Mississippi says he caught up with his other three companions and he killed them all, and that he was the last of the four... He asks him to stand up... and as the audience observed, Mississippi wasn't wearing, at all, any gun...

Obviously, when Jason just brought his outfit into town, the action started...

Robert Mitchum is 'the tin star with a drunk pinned on it.' He was too mad to be scared and too sick to worry about it..

Charlene Holt plays Maudie the gambler's widow who throws her arms around Cole, sees Harrah, and bursts out laughing when she finds her old flame and her current one are friends... She tells the sheriff that Cole gave her a stake, and helped her get on her feet...

Michele Carey plays Joey, the wild girl who thinks that Mississippi looks a lot better without that silly hat...

Christopher George plays Nelse McLeod, a dark, thin-faced man with a scar on his eye...

""El Dorado"" was the third of four Westerns that Howard Hawks made with John Wayne... Hawks' massive reputation as a director of Westerns virtually rests on just two films (""Red River"" & ""Rio Bravo"") but these two are sufficient to reveal a highly skilled, intuitive filmmaker, and one who has managed to satisfy large audiences and serious critics alike within a commercial system...",1233446400,,3681,4.635944700460829

Director Howard Hawks once again hooked up with John Wayne to revisit the moral codes and deep loyalty of good men to others who live by this code. As in nearly all films made by this great director, the theme of women being the downfall of good men who still cannot live without them remains prominent. This remake of Rio Bravo is fabulously entertaining and as such stands as one of the truly great films in the genre.

Wayne may indeed be marvelous here in one of his best performances, but he has stiff competition from Robert Mitchum and a very young James Caan. The mere fact that Hawks could assemble such a cast is in itself astounding. To have Robert Mitchum and John Wayne together is tantamount to having Gable and Tyrone Power share the screen at their zenith, or Garbo and Sherarer appearing together. Whereas many great films might have one larger than life star whose character you can't take your eyes from, this film has two and a half.

The half is for a young James Caan, whose charming and magnetic performance showed his niche in films, and catapulted him to the upper ranks in the minds of many. There is a bit more backstory than in Rio Bravo, as Hawks shows the relationship of  gunfighter Cole Thornton (John Wayne) to his old pal, Sheriff J.P., (Robert Mitchum) who have a long and storied history of riding the trail together. They are two of the four best guns in the west, but the different paths they've chosen has not diminished their friendship or loyalty to each other because they live by the same moral code.

Cole inadvertently becomes involved in a range feud in El Dorado over water and gets shot by spunky and very pretty Michelle Carey as Joey, a member of the MacDonald family J.P. is protecting from rancher Bart Jason (Ed Asner) and his hands. Though it doesn't kill him, the bullet cannot be removed, and the spasms it brings to his gun-hand on occasion will come into play when months later he runs into one of the other four fast guns who is heading for El Dorado to work for Jason. Since J.P. has become a drunk and the laughingstock of the town, it seems an easy task.

Two of Hawks' favorite themes immediately appear at this juncture; the moral code which binds good men together and the women that can make them crawl into the bottle. James Caan is used for the former as a young riverboat brat avenging the death of the gambler who raised him. He attaches himself to Cole as he heads back to El Dorado. Simply called Mississippi because his real name is of such length and formality, he lives by the same moral code so instantly knows Cole will be heading for El Dorado after hearing about his pal J.P. from slick and dangerous gunman, Christopher George.

It is a conversation between George and Wayne which brings out the latter theme; Cole knowing even before George tells him that a woman was the only thing which could have derailed J.P., even knowing the type he would have been such a fool over. Though Rio Bravo had some humor, and a great performance from Dean Martin, El Dorado has more, and it is quite fun for the viewer watching Cole sober up J.P., with help from Mississippi's concoction, and J.P.'s old Indian-fighter pal, Bull (Arthur Hunnicutt).

There is the usual stuff here we've seen many times, but here it is done in such entertaining fashion we can't wait to see the outcome. The conversation near the end between J.P. and Cole, who may have reversed roles due to lovely Charlene Holt as Maudie, is a riot! Also hilarious is Mississippi's inability to shoot straight, even with a shotgun! Almost lost in the male camaraderie and bonding is the smaller role of Marina Ghane as Maria. She was quite lovely, however.

Hawks seemed to return to these themes again and again in his films, albeit in westerns or crime dramas. This is truly one of the great westerns. It does not get touted like some because there is no hidden symbolism; it is straightforward and everyone can see what Hawks is saying. For my money, however, I prefer Hawks to the more heralded western makers like John Ford. A nice western score by Sinatra arranger Nelson Riddle, of all people, and some great western art by Olaf Wieghorst used for the opening credits add to what is already one of the most fascinating films in the genre ever filmed.

136299,5,0792110188,"Some say that Howard Hawks made the same picture three times with Rio Bravo, El Dorado, and Rio Lobo.  In the broad strokes, it is true.  John Wayne isn't the straight romantic lead in any of them, but has his interests.  There are several beautiful young women in different roles in the film and there is a younger man, usually a male star that someone is trying to push (Ricky Nelson, James Caan, and Jorge Rivero).  And Wayne is fighting some mysterious guy with all the money trying to cheat and drive out an honest family.  All the stories have enough twists to be enjoyable.  And I liked this story very much.

In this movie John Wayne plays a hired gun named Cole Thornton.  He comes into El Dorado and meets up with Sheriff JP Harrah (Robert Mitchum).  The have known each other since before the Civil War, but something has passed between them.  They respect each other, but aren't quite close friends.  One of the problems is Maudie (the beautiful and captivating Charlene Holt).  She has a relationship with the Sheriff, but she has deep affection for Cole, and that spoils it for Harrah.

The Sheriff is worried that Cole has gone over to a bad place and wants to fill him in on the truth about Bart Jason (Ed Asner) who has hired Cole.  The truth is that Jason has been building a big spread that requires more water, but the water he needs is on land owned by the MacDonald family.  The MacDonalds have been on their land and built their ranch over a lifetime and after much sacrifice and hard work.  They don't want to sell.  Cole is supposed to convince them to sell.  Cole decides he doesn't want to work for Jason and heads over to his place to return the money he was paid - less traveling expenses.  The MacDonalds have heard about Cole and left one of their sons as a watchman.  A tragedy occurs and the boy's sister ends up shooting Cole with a wound that leaves a bullet pressing against his spine.  Every now and again, it causes Cole shooting pain and temporary paralysis that increases with time.

Cole leaves the town and along the way picks up Alan Bourdillion Traherne (James Caan) as a traveling companion.  Traherne is called Mississippi by Cole because he finds the name as absurd as the man's hat.

There are people on both sides of the fight over the MacDonald's land, but by the time Cole returns to El Dorado, Harrah is a sorry drunk.  The story builds to a climax with Cole, Harrah, Bull Harris, and (Arthur Hunnicutt) under siege in the town jail.  Christopher George does a nice turn as Nelse McLeod, the gun hired by Jason to counter Cole's support of Harrah.

I will let you watch the movie to see the way things work out.  Sure, you can guess the final resolution, but the way the story twists and turns does keep us entertained.  One of the lighter moments comes when Harrah sobers up and his companions demand that he bather.  I will let you delight in the way the scene plays out.

Quite a good Waynestern.

A perfect example of a remake is the 1957 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma-Special-Edition/dp/B000TGJ82Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma (Special Edition)</a>, starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin.

Same characters, same exact plot. Only the sequence and action was updated. That is a remake. In Rio Bravo the Sheriff is holding the brother of a rich rancher for murder and the story takes us through how the rancher tries to free his brother at any cost. In El Dorado, based on the Book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stars-in-Their-Courses/dp/1568496648/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stars in Their Courses</a>&nbsp;by Harry Brown, the main plot revolves around a range war between two ranchers, the tough but fair Kevin MacDonald (R.G. Armstrong) and the land-grabbing Bart Jason (Ed Asner). This is not a remake.

John Wayne plays Cole Thornton, a hired gun whom Jason is trying to hire to help drive MacDonald off his ranch so that Jason can steal the water rights. What Jason doesn't know is that Thornton is an old friend to the local sheriff, J.P. Hara, played by Robert Mitchum. Of course, Thornton turns down the job. But unknown to him, MacDonald has been mistakenly warned that Thornton was working for Jason, which leads to Thornton accidentally killing one of MacDonald's sons, Luke (Johnny Crawford of The Rifleman Fame) and then getting shot by a MacDonald daughter (Michele Carey). The killing of Luke haunts Thornton to the point where he feels he owes the MacDonalds but can't face them, leading him to leave. This all happens in the first 15 minutes of the film and sets up the rest perfectly.

As the story progresses we meet ""Mississippi"" (a young James Caan), a man who had spent two years chasing down a group of cowboys who murdered his friend. Christopher George plays Nelse McLeod, a gunman with an interesting sense of fairness who joins Jason. And we find out that after Thornton left El Dorado his pal Hara turned into a drunk because of a ""wandering petticoat."" It's up to Thornton, Mississippi, and Hara's deputy ""Bull"" (played wonderfully by character actor Arthur Hunnicutt) to put Hara back together before McLeod can take advantage of the situation. What follows is some of the best gunfights that a mid-1960's western could produce.

Throughout the film we're treated to great action, wonderful lines (Bull's ""Well I'd be a suck-egged mule"" is still one of my favorites), a bit of comedy relief here and there, and some good-ole fashion sex-appeal coming from Charlene Holt and Michele Carey. Just what every guy back in the 60's loved about going to see a John Wayne Western at a Saturday matinee.

I would highly recommend this to any John Wayne/Robert Mitchum/Western fan. Believe me, it will not disappoint.",1201478400,3,3774,5.733928571428572
136301,5,0792110188,"I am about 50. And I have a fairly large DVD collection and before that LD (never collected VHS). I have a TIVO and have had one for about 9 years. I am always looking for more good films. So with that background understand that I have been fortunate enough to see many classic films in the theatre, or on cable or SAT. Without commercials(the ONLY way to watch anything).
I am a John Wayne fan and a fan of westerns.  I like a lot of different ones- from Stagecoach (both versions) to Clint Eastwoods new ones to Peckinpah and Fords.

And this movie is MY FAVORITE WESTERN.  I like most of John Waynes films from the late 40s on. And most westerns from that time on. Earlier then that not much.

With that background in mind here is my review:

I had this film on LD for years and upgraded to DVD.
I watch it on a projection screen with a pretty good home theatre so its like watching it in a real picture palace (except no bratty kids or chewing gum stuck on the seats).
The opening score and song are classic; the pictures (painted by The Swede-Thorntons gunsmith friend) rival Remmington at his best.
For those that remember the TV Series ""How The West was Won"" of the late 70s this opening score and paintings are just as good.

The Duke is a top gun man for hire; not young and he knows it. He is about to take a job from Bart Jason (Ed Asner) but the local sheriff finds him first. He is an old friend. And Cole Thornton finds out that the job is to kill his old friend. Needless to say Cole tells Jason where he can stick his job.
Unfortunately a well meaning friend has told the ultimate target of jason that Thornton is here after him and his family and a tragedy occurrs that will have ramifications for the entire movie.
the First half hour of this film sets up the rest in all ways. And does a pretty good job of it.
In many ways this is as complete a film as you could ask for- and they do it without voice over which is a real mark in its favor as regards allowing the viewer to make up his mind and figure it out all on his own.
John Wayne in this film really starts to accept the aging process. There are good bits here and there that show this. Mitchum does as well but not to the same degree (of course Mitchum was younger so....)
There are so many good little scenes and the supporting charactors are all very well fleshed out-with the exception of Jason (but this bad guy is just simply a greedy man wanting power and willing to have others do the killing for him- which is smart since the one time he does pick up a gun it does not turn out well for him).
This is a remake of Rio Bravo- but I am not alone in thinking that this is just as good and in some areas better (no singing, no Ricky Nelson).
Angie Dickinson is a little better then Charlene Holt, but then her part is also much bigger. James Caan is PERFECT as the young green kid who cannot shoot straight. Arthur Hunnicut is to me frankly better as the crotchety old Deputy. Michele Carey has a great part as a cowgirl who is a top shot (which Cole Thornton finds out the hard way)= she is an actress who sadly never got enough parts = I think she could have been a real star. Christopher George plays the Top Gun on the other side- and how his part is handled shows the master craftsman Howard Hawks at his best. He took care for such a relatively small part to flesh out it and the charactor very well without using much screen time.
If you like westerns you will love this film. If you like John Wayne you will love this film.  If you like films that were made by master craftsmen like Howard Hawks with a cast as good as you can ask for and dialogue well fitted you will love this film.",1200096000,2,3672,4.1344537815126055

Essentially this is virtual remake of Rio Bravo, and it isn't as good. Mitchum takes the Dean Martin role and James Cann the Ricky Nelson role. However Howard Hawks was a great filmmaker and he manages to make this a worthwhile and very entertaining movie in its own right.

John Wayne is starting to show his age in this film. He was close to 60 when it was made, and Mitchum who was 10 years younger steals the film from Wayne. The kill or cure drunk cure for J.P. is probably the best scene in the film, and Mitchum plays it brilliantly. There are good supporting roles from the lovely Michele Carey as Joey and Arthur Hunnictt as 'Bull'.

136306,3,0792110188,"Well.. I can't say I am a HUGE Western fan.. I'm not really.. I don't get them.. and I can't say I am a HUGE John Wayne film.. BUT having said that, I have always enjoyed his later films..

This is said to be a remake of Rio Bravo..which, I actually do hold in higher regard.. The whole tension of the film is just not quite as severe here. There's an almost palpable sense of paranoid in Bravo, that El Dorado misses. Granted alor of the characters are cliehed and practicalyl interchangeable between the two. I am neck and neck with Mitchum vs. Martin on this one.. although, I do give a slight edge to Mitchum.. but the irrascible Walter Brennan in Bravo wins out for me over this one.

Still though I do not see it as a remake.. a sequel.. or anything really.. its more just a loose collection that bears some similarity.. but it is its own animal. Granted Caan was great in a very early role as ""Mississippi"" which you can't really comapre to the Ricky Nelson role in Bravo (he has what 6 lines in the entire film?). But I still find the third film, Rio Lobo unjustly maligned.. its not a BAD film.. granted not a great one but all three are still very watchable.. and its almost like watching very SIMILAR movies through a different lens which makes them interesting to watch.

BUT.. am I a John Wayne fan? I'd say.. no.. I enjoy quite a few of his movies though.. True Grit, Liberty Valence, Sons of Katie Elder, The Cowboys, the three I previously mentioned and The Shootist... and I'll even toss in Big Jake.. he played it with a bit more swagger.. but he played a bit of a nastier version of himself.. and a great supporting cast too.

Still though..back to this film. I really did enjoy the film. and the final shoot out was great, but I still give the edge to Bravo.. MAYBE its just because it was the first (although tht really didn't matter to me since I saw most of them early on and never thought of which came first). BUT.. the influence of Bravo can be SERIOUSLY felt in Carpenter's Assault on Preceint 13 (he offers a commentary on the new dvd), the recent remake even has a similar vibe... and oddly, to me.. but James Manigold'a Copland always SCREAMED Rio Bravo to me.

Being a sequel.. remake or reimaging of that is no shame.. and this one is its own world filled with its own unique and fun characters.. I actually will say that may be why people enjoy this one more.. as the humor is a bit more.. evident here. Everyone has a good easy time, more so than Rio Bravo which at times is.. I won't say humorless but not quite as much on the fun side while still remaining an excellent film. From the ""cure"" to Missippi pulling on a shaw and a wet flower pot as a ""disguise"" there is much more a sense of fun in this film that I think propels it ahead..

But.. no matter which you pick, El Dorado (with its great opening) or Rio Bravo.. you still can't lose. Both are great Westerns that will have you wanting to come back to the Old West again.",1189728000,,2965,4.276292335115865
136307,5,0792110188,"I love John Wayne westerns. My husband loves his war movies. El Dorado is one of my all-time favorite westerns and right behind ""The Quiet Man"" for my favorite John Wayne movie.

My kids loved the theme song. The younger one used to sing ""Ride Goldie Ride"" (instead of Ride Boldly Ride) for days after watching this. I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD as the VHS version was well worn.

Sure, it's a remake of Rio Bravo. I love Rio Bravo but think El Dorado is better. Even though I like Dean Martin in Rio Bravo a lot, Robert Michum  portrays a drunken sheriff so much betterand is funnier. ""I've got a bed in the jail. It's hard and narrow, but he won't get bounced around."" Ed Asner is a better bad guy. Claude Akins' character in Rio Bravo is a dumb thug; Asner's intelligence shows into his character in El Dorado. Yeah, no singing in El Dorado and I did like that in Rio Bravo. My husband says Rio Bravo is better just because of the very young, scantily clad Angie Dickinson.

John Wayne portrays an honorable gun fighter. He's still tough as nails, fighting on the right side, loyal to his friends, and gets the girl. That part would be a little hard to believe nowadays, or would it? The girl is way young for him and Mitchum, but she is obviously, though it wasn't stated, a cathouse madam, and therefore, a man with money is attractive, regardless of age. John Wayne was one big tall fella, and every time I see this movie, I look for him on his horse, Cochise. Wayne practically dwarfs his horse. Caan and Mitchum were both tall men, but the Duke just towers over everyone.

James Caan is young, handsome, and amusing. His character Mississippi, is just the right complement to Wayne's and Mitchum's near-crusty, experienced gunslinging characters. I loved his home remedy for sobering up Mitchum. The bath scene, with many bars of soap is funny, too.

No bad language, no sex (you don't even see lips touch during the kissing scenes), no one bleeds when they get shot, and the good guys win at the end.",1189209600,2,2022,4.436657681940701
136308,5,0792110188,"This is Wayne and Hawks' redo of Rio Bravo and although that movie was great fun and didn't need to be redone, I'm glad they did.  El Dorado is better in my opinion for a few reasons, but I'll stop there at comparing these movies because they are both great.

This is a fun comedy western with great action, drama, and dialogue.  There are some really cool characters here that you just love to watch.  John Wayne of course is the star and he does his usual hard as nails with a caring core weapon for hire, Cole Thornton, who just happens to be at the wrong or right place at the right or wrong time (depending on how you look at it).

What's unusual about this movie is that John Wayne's Cole Thornton isn't at the top of his game anymore, and he knows it, especially due to a nerve problem sustained from a gun shot earlier in the movie.  Yet he must go against the best anyway and he uses his brains not just his bravado to win the day.

Robert Mitchum plays the drunken El Dorado Sheriff J.P. Harrah that Cole Thorton must aid.  This is where Rio Bravo and El Dorado become one in the same, but this time they have the main bad guy in jail and not his punk brother.

Arthur Hunnicutt is Bull Harris, Mitchum's sidekick, deputy, and good friend, and James Caan plays Alan Bourdillion Traherne (Which is a mouthful so they just call him 'Mississippi'), Wayne's sidekick.  Both of these characters have back stories of their own though minor and are not only great help to our two main characters, but loads of fun for us viewers.

And then there's Charlene Holt as Maudie.  She's the love interest for someone???  It changes as the movie develops, but she does a good job tying up story lines for John Wayne's character as we follow his adventures away from El Dorado for a while, and although Bull could have done that for us, it's much more fun to see Wayne with Holt.

And then there's Michele Carey who plays Josephine (Joey) MacDonald, who is probably the sexiest cowgirl I've ever seen, and she's as tough as she is beautiful.  She is Caan's love interest, and interesting she is.

This is a classic Wayne Western.  Good action, great characters, good comedy, just a little romance, and a great showdown at the end.  I highly recommend this and Rio Bravo for John Wayne movie lovers.  Two of his best or at least two of my favorites.",1185321600,,2342,4.392111368909513
136309,5,0792110188,"This movie would be easy to confuse with the movie ""Rio Bravo"" bacause both movies carry a plot thread involving a drunken lawman who must be sobered up in order to keep him alive, but don't be deceived. These are two different movies with entirely different story lines. I have both titles in my collection and am glad to have both.

In this one James Mitchum gives an outstanding performance as the drunken marshal with John Wayne coming to his aid. John Wayne and James Caan sober him up with a witches brew of which, thank the Lord, we don't have to watch, or smell, the effects.

Mitchum is trying to protect a family of ranchers from the schemes of a land grabbing cattle baron played to cynical perfection by Ed Asner. (this was before he bacame beloved as Lou Grant on tv.) Before the movie is over the plot twists and turns like a coyote covered with fire ants, but everything comes out all right in the end. (except for Ed Asner, He's dead.)

In all a good action adventure, with some violence.  It is interesting to note that John Wayne is shot early in the film and is still suffering life threatening effects at the end.  A relief from so many movies of the period where the hero suffers major wounds and a couple of days later shoots down a herd of villains and whips the bad guy in a fist fight.

It is also worth noting that while this movie takes some humor from devices to sober up the co-star, neither this movie or ""Rio Bravo"" treat alcoholism as a humorous condition. In both movies, it is treated as a life-threatening and humiliating condition, with lingering and painful side-effects.

Sorry, neither Dean Martin, Angie Dickinson, Rick Nelson, or Walter Brennan appear in this movie. It doesn't need them.  If you want to see them, buy ""Rio Bravo""",1176768000,12,1771,4.5125

136312,5,0792110188,"The setting for this western is Texas sometime after the Civil War. There are a number of unique, or at least uncommon, elements in this flick. It begins with a delightful song, ""El Dorado"", and the showing of still paintings of Old West scenes. Later, a shootout occurs not only inside and near a saloon, as one might expect in a typical western, but also in a church (belfry and then sanctuary). Women (notably rancher MacDonald's cowgirl daughter) are more prominent in this flick than in most other westerns.

There are many violent scenes in the film. Not only are shootings shown, but so also is a vendetta stabbing. Wounded men (including Cole Thornton) are shown in agony.

The politically correct won't be happy with the start of this film. Cole Thornton (John Wayne) mentions that, before the arrival of rancher MacDonald in the area, ""there was nothing here except Indians and coyotes"". But of course this film was made at a very different time from today (1967).

Rancher MacDonald's son, Luke, is sent to guard the ranch. This is, later according to Thornton, ""A boy doing a man's job."" Luke falls asleep and, at the sound of an approaching horseman, wakes up and opens fire wildly. The horseman fires back as a reflex, wounding Luke in the lower abdomen. It turns out that the horseman is none other than Cole Thornton. Luke writhes in agony, explains to Thornton what happened, and then commits suicide with his own gun.

Thornton tells father MacDonald what happened, and the latter sadly accepts the truth. But Luke's cowgirl sister does not. She set up a revenge ambush for Thornton, and fires a rifle at him. She says triumphantly: ""There, you won't be killing any more boys!"" But it turns out that she only managed to wound Thornton in the lower back. For the rest of the film, Thornton has episodic problems with disabling back pain and arm paralysis from the bullet lodged in his back, which he neglects to have removed promptly.

In time, one of MacDonald's remaining three sons is kidnapped, and Cole Thornton works for his release. The local sheriff at first is of no help. He is constantly drunk, and is a laughingstock for everyone around. But in time he gets sober, returns to the saloon, and has a bit of revenge against those who had been laughing at him.

At one point, Thornton seems to have an upper hand in a gunfight with MacDonald's kidnappers. But then, at the worse possible moment, Thornton is hit with a spell of back pain and arm paralysis. He is totally helpless! What will the kidnappers do to him? Will he at least get out alive? Will MacDonald's kidnapped survive and ever go free? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.",1172707200,4,2671,4.672340425531915
136313,4,0792110188,I happen to be a big fan of Olaf Wieghorst and own an original oil.  The vehicle of DVD is ideal for the purposes I bought this particular movie. I realize that many purchasers will care less about the item I like the most and that was the eight or more paintings by Olaf that come with the beginning credits.

136317,3,0792110188,"The mid-1960s was a point of intersection for American movies. It is a bit of a lost era and one of the lowest points in Hollywood's history. It is situated long after the peak glories of the `golden age' of Hollywood and just before the New Hollywood movement that would breathe such new and invigorating life into the ailing medium. In many ways the films from this era are the ones which new filmmakers would react so strongly against; movies high in budget but sparse in originality, cast with aging movie stars playing worn characters; bloated, lifeless, and out of touch with the rapidly changing social climate of the day. ""El Dorado"", released in 1967, is most assuredly a film of this era. It is a western of such a standard concept that it could have been made thirty years prior. Its stars, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, are well past their primes and here look stiff, heavy, and old. It is, like so many others of the time, a film that seems irrelevant and washed up; a product of `going through the motions.' Its one saving grace, however, is that it occasionally seems all too aware of this fact.

I say that Wayne and Mitchum seem tired and old. This is no doubt due in part to their actual age, but it is also because they are playing characters who are tired and old. Mitchum plays J.P. Harrah, the drunken sheriff of El Dorado, and Wayne, Cole Thornton, a long time friend and aging gunslinger. The two shuffle and trudge though the film in a way we modern film spectators would love to call them out on, but which is intentional nearly to the point of inspired. Wayne especially, who at one point even needs help mounting his horse, seems more than aware of his changing role in films, and is obviously set about to age gracefully. He would go on to do this notion great justice in 1976's ""The Shootist"", but we can see the seeds of this self-reflexivity even here, some ten year prior. Mitchum too plays his role as a drunk with a certain amount of moxie, both recognizing and poking fun at his own reputation. The film is not a pure comedy, however, and despite their limitations, both the actors and characters do their best to prove they still have it, and do so to a degree of success. The scenes of hung-over Mitchum and half-paralyzed Wayne shooting their way through the streets of El Dorado determined to hold their own are quite exciting and enjoyable, and it is this aspect of the movie, this negotiation with age and character, that brings its greatest successes.

But this does not save the film as a whole. Despite the apparent awareness of these actors that they are playing tired, worn characters, they are still playing tired, worn characters. And even if the characters have a certain added depth, both the direction and the screenplay certainly do not. The story is lifeless and dull, revolving around business disputes and questions of who is the fastest draw. Much of Wayne's dialogue, especially early in the film, sounds as if it were a compilation of dialogue from every other western he has made, and the movie as a whole feels as though it must have seemed badly dated even at the time of its release. Howard Hawks, that old master of the Hollywood western, tries to bring new life to the film though the quirky character of Mississippi, played by a young James Caan, and through some intentionally odd humour, but these attempts to be `hip' cannot help but feel heavy-handed and false, like a middle age man trying to seem `cool' for the kids. There are hints that Hawks could see a future for Westerns, particularly through this humour which seems somewhat a precursor to Leone and the spaghetti westerns, but for the most part he comes across as what he is: an ageing director trying, but ultimately failing, to make films the way he always has and yet keep current.

One need only put this movie into context to see its awkward place in cinematic history. It comes some ten years after the western peaked with ""The Searchers"" (1956) and some eight years after Hawks' own ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), which also starred Wayne and Mitchum, and was already a look back to the past glories of the genre. Two years after ""El Dorado"" Wayne starred in the painfully out of touch ""The Green Berets"" (1968), a film that would solidify Wayne's position outside of contemporary culture. Westerns themselves would soon be turned upside down and shaken by Sam Peckinpah and other young filmmakers who would more competently play with the conventions of the genre. But here is ""El Dorado"", firmly within the middle: a film aware enough of its own age to be interesting, but lacking enough ambition or energy to solve this dilemma. Some of it is quite enjoyable, and Wayne and Mitchum are often great to watch, but ultimately the film is as awkward and stiff as the many other films of its era.",1156291200,7,4820,4.615384615384615

136323,3,0792110188,"Who'd of thought that a Howard Hawks western starring John Wayne and Robert Mitchum could be so mediocre?  Wayne who went on to snare a deserved Oscar for ""True Grit"", looked ancient and ill suited to portray one of the fastest draws in the west, gunfighter Cole Thornton.  He seemed even more unbelieveable in winning the affections of attractive widow Maudie played by Charlene Holt.

Wayne joins forces with alcoholic El Dorado sheriff J.P. Harrah, not much of a stretch for Robert Mitchum who seemed half asleep at times in the film.  Wayne had been recruited by land baron Bart Jason played by a snotty Ed Asner to evict the rightful owner of a tract of land that he desired, which Wayne ultimately declined to do.  Together they fight off an Asner sponsored gang led by facially scarred actor Christopher George.

Unfortunately ""El Dorado""'s tired theme had been done before and in much better fashion in films such as ""Shane"" for example.  The aged pair of Wayne and Mitchum didn't do it for me.  James Caan in one of his first major roles was not well cast in this movie.  Arthur Hunnicutt playing deputy Bull Harris was the acting highlight of the film.

136329,5,0792110188,"I love John Wayne movies, and I love Amazon's dedication to offer the most for your dollar, so this Exclusive, to me, is the best of both worlds! While several 'signature' Wayne films (the Ford 'Cavalry' trilogy, in particular), are absent, and other 'classics' can be purchased individually, or in other boxed sets, this John Wayne DVD collection offers 10 of the Duke's most memorable films of the 60s and 70s...at less than $10, each! Talk about getting your money's worth!

The titles include:

""El Dorado"" and ""Rio Lobo"": Howard Hawks' two variations of his classic, ""Rio Bravo"", all starring Wayne. ""El Dorado"", in particular, is a most worthy 'remake', offering Robert Mitchum in a wonderful comic send-up of the Dean Martin role, James Caan more entertaining than Ricky Nelson, and Arthur Hunnicutt, complete with bugle, filling Walter Brennan's shoes. Add Ed Asner as the villain, and Duke, standing tall (even while carrying a bullet inside him), and you have a first-rate actioner. While ""Rio Lobo"" is a disappointment (both Wayne and Hawks were sadly showing their years), it does offer the gorgeous (if wooden) Jennifer O'Neill, future studio boss Sherry Lansing, and Mitchum's son, Chris (along with an unbilled appearance by Wayne's youngest son, Ethan), in support.

""Hatari!"": One of the BEST Hawks/Wayne teamings, this vastly entertaining African comedy/adventure may be the longest 'Buddy' film ever made, at 157 minutes, but Wayne, with all-star support including Hardy Krger, Elsa Martinelli, and Red Buttons, makes capturing wild animals for zoos and circuses an irresistable experience!

""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"": John Ford's last 'Classic' western, a deconstruction of the mythic West that he and Wayne helped create. Equal parts comedy and tragedy, with a healthy dose of old-fashioned politics, as Jimmy Stewart achieves national acclaim by shooting town bully Lee Marvin...an act actually done by Wayne! ""When people prefer the myth to the truth, print the myth"" is a credo Ford believed in, and this film is it's purest embodiment. A MUST!

""Donovan's Reef"": Ford and Wayne, teamed again with Lee Marvin, in a delightful South Seas romp, as prim Elizabeth Allen learns to 'loosen up' under Wayne's brawny charms (forget the 27-year age difference!) Brawling fun, with Jack Warden, Cesar Romero, and saronged Dorothy Lamour in support.

""The Sons of Katie Elder"": Most significant as being Wayne's triumphant return to the screen after losing a lung to cancer, this sprawling Henry Hathaway-directed western reteams Duke with Dean Martin (as BROTHERS?), in an entertaining tale of four brothers' vengeance; with a flavorful Elmer Bernstein score.

""True Grit"": Hathaway directs Wayne to an Oscar, as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn. An underappreciated gem (Duke playing an old, fat reprobate upset many fans), but he has a ball in the role, and few of his films captured the 'feel' of the period, better!

""In Harm's Way"": Otto Preminger and Wayne made a great team, in the director's HUGE saga of Pearl Harbor, and the early days of the Pacific war. No superhuman heroics, here, just a dedicated Naval officer (Wayne), his relationships (with Patricia Neal, Brandon De Wilde, and a superb Kirk Douglas), and his part in helping turn the tide of the war.

""Big Jake"": Violent, but engrossing late western, as Duke's grandson (played by son Ethan) is kidnapped by Richard Boone's gang, and his estranged wife (radiant Maureen O'Hara, in her last teaming), depends on him to recover the boy. Featuring another Wayne son, Patrick, Robert Mitchum's son, Chris, and MANY of the old John Ford 'stock company' in support; at times quite brutal, but still one of Wayne's best 'late' films.

""The Shootist"": Wayne's swansong is a loving tribute, despite the many difficulties his declining health caused. A legendary gunfighter must choose between dying from cancer or in a blaze of glory; from the wonderful opening montage of Wayne clips from several of his most popular westerns, to the bittersweet conclusion, a fitting film finale, with several 'old friends' in supporting roles.

Wayne and Mitchum are a little long in the tooth and there is talk of settling down, but there are scores to settle and justice to enforce first.

Near the end of the movie is a faux pas regarding crutches. Both the heroes are using crutches by this time and Mitchum mistakenly changes the side he's using. John Wayne picks up on the oversight and quips to Mitchum in an ad-lib ( I believe) that is very clever.

John Wayne is thoroughly the ""Duke"" here - his swagger, tough talk, hard-bitten quips, and ironic surprise at everything that happens. I don't recall him being as ""Himself"" as he is in this movie.

There are many comic moments amid the classic tale of hired guns, good versus evil, fights over water rights, and ""top hand"" winning the girl. All in all, a delightful film well worth watching.",1101600000,12,1022,4.5683060109289615

First off, no singing or cast based on the need for singers!  This is a REAL, honest-to-God, Western, with a big ""W"".  John Wayne and Robert Mitchum really work well together.  You can feel the history behind their friendship and this adds to the conflict, the struggle, they feel, as one has to watch the other recover from crawling into the bottle.  James Caan brings a LOT to the cast, really allowing a way for much of the humor to enter the film.

For worse, it features the not-as-good Robert Mitchum portraying a character similar to Dean Martin's Dude, which was a powerful character in the earlier film. Also, the story is predictable for the most part. For good, though, James Caan does a better job as Mississippi in this film than Ricky Nelson did as Colorado in ""Rio Bravo."" The gunfights are also well-done. And, last but not least, it IS a John Wayne film, and no film Wayne did was bad, in my opinion.
Overall, a fine film that lacks the impact of ""Rio Bravo,"" but is still an exciting John Wayne adventure! Grade: B+",1098576000,6,837,4.662162162162162
136334,5,0792110188,"I know that ""El Dorado"" is basically a remake by Howard Hawks of ""Rio Lobo,"" which was made a whole seven years earlier, but I like this 1966 film better. It is not just that you have both John Wayne and Robert Mitchum fitting comfortably into their roles but you also have young James Caan and old Arthur Hunnicutt in colorful supporting roles. There is a sense of fun to the proceedings even as everybody takes them seriously.

 Wayne is Cole Thornton, an ace gunslinger who turns down an offer to join up with hired gun Nelse McLeod (Christopher George) at the behest of Bart Jason (Edward Asner), the big shot of the town of El Dorado, because it means going up against old pal J. P. Harrah (Mitchum). But it turns out that Harrah has been hitting the bottle hard, so Thorton decides to help his old friend. Unfortunately he is wounded by a bullet that is lodged near his spine and causes paralysis from time to time. Also on their side are old Bull Harris (Hunnicutt) and the young Alan Bourdillion Traherne (Caan), who is called ""Mississippi"" by his friends for obvious reasons. Maudie (Charlene Holt) is the woman who would like to see Colt and J.P. live to die of old age and Joey (Michele Carey) is the young hothead who shots Thornton and catches the eye of Mississippi.

 This is an interesting film from Wayne's perspective because the Duke keeps letting his co-stars have most of the big moments. True, the script dictates that his character has to allow Mitchum's drunken sherrif to redeem himself, but Wayne gets credit for being the rock on which this film is made. Ultimately, ""El Dorado"" is driven more by the engaging characters than the action of suspense. It is also one of the last Westerns to have a rowdy theme song, with George Alexander, backed by the Mellomen, singing the title written by Nelson Riddle and George Alexander.

 In addition to Hawks and Wayne being around for both films, Leigh Brackett did the screenplay for both as well and I think a large measure of the success of ""El Dorado"" goes to her for creating these characters. She obviously gets the credit for the dialogue, which really does not provide the sort of one-liners that you want to quote ad infinitum, but which still provides a lot of humorous little moments driven more by the characters than the words. The result is not a classic Western in the John Ford mold, but still it is a solid one which makes it well above average all things considered.",1091145600,2,2452,4.5867579908675795
136335,5,0792110188,"Paired with Robert Mitchum, El Dorado is essentially a remake of Howard Hawks' earlier Rio Bravo (with writer Leigh Brackett updating her own script). John Wayne, instead of sheriff, plays an aging gunman, who is getting too wise for the game. Robert Mitchum, as the drunken sheriff, takes over the role of the drunken Dean Martin, and James Caan is the fresh faced greenhorn last played by Ricky Nelson (thankfully, Caan doesn't sing). Hawks and Brackett take their time in setting up this story, giving Wayne and Mitchum plenty of backstory, before the stand-off in the town of El Dorado.
In this movie, Thornton is offered a job by land grabber Ed Asner to take out the Sheriff of El Dorado and run the rightful landowners off their land.  Thornton refuses and instead goes to El dorado to help his friend against the other gunmen Asner hired led by Nelse McCloud played by regualr Wayne Co-Star Christopher George.
Caan plays Mississippi a young man who cannot use a gun and is given a sawed off shotgun as his weapon.  Arthur Hunnicut plays Bull and essentially takes over the role that Walter Brennan played in ""Rio Bravo"".
The movie has a great deal of action as well as humor as Wayne and Caan and Hunnicutt attempt to sober up the sheriff.  Wayne and Mitchum had great chemistry together and even though the Duke was aging, still commands the screen in this movie.

Robert Mitchum can play a drunk trying to cope with a hongover as well as anybody in movies. Howard Hawkes is best remembered for his direction of SERGEANT YORK.
I always thought that EL DORADO deserved a high rating even though it failed to receive any Oscar nominations in 1967. The Academy award competition in that year was dominated by BONNIE AND CLYDE, THE GRADUATE and IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.",1081728000,2,964,4.643274853801169

Wayne reprises the Wayne part, Mitchum the Martin, Caan the Nelson and Hunnicutt the Brennan. Wayne is noticeably older and paunchier and doesn't quite have the chemistry with Mitchum that he had with Martin but it's not a bad effort. Hunnicutt's deadpan delivery is almost as amusing as Brennan's moaning and shrieking. James Caan is a better actor than Nelson if perhaps not so easy on the eye.

136340,5,0792110188,"Director Howard Hawks turned out some great westerns, but this has to be the best (in my opinion).  Teaming up once again with John Wayne, El Dorado is a great film with an engaging storyline and a cast of characters that you can't help but like.  First of all, there's the Duke, playing Cole Thornton, a gunslinger for hire who finds himself mixed up in a water dispute.  Also starring is Robert Mitchum, a drunken sheriff who's an excellent gunslinger--when he's sober enough to hold a gun.  But the one who steals the show, in my opinion, is James Caan, aka Mississippi.
Caan plays a young man who can't shoot straight but is great with a knife.  To compensate for this, Cole buys him a sawed-off shotgun, and hilarity ensues every time he pulls the trigger--  everything from shooting the wrong guy to wounding his friends to missing his target altogether.  In fact, this is one of the great things about this movie--it's funny.
This is a great Western, one of the best in my opinion.  The story is intriguing, and the characters have a great chemistry.  If you want an good old-fashioned bang-em-up Western which is good for a lot of laughs as well, try El Dorado.  You won't be disappointed.",1047081600,4,1197,4.60377358490566
136341,5,0792110188,"It may not have the stature--critically or in the popular mind--of the films the Duke made in his prime, like ""Stagecoach,"" ""The Searchers,"" or the Cavalry Trilogy, but this boisterous Western clearly shows why Wayne got away for so long with ""playing himself.""  He and co-star Mitchum bring to the screen, if not the limber bodies of their youth, a presence and experience (between them they had more than six decades in film by the time they made this one) that we seldom see in today's stars.  Very sensibly, they both play men of experience who are now slowing down a bit and beginning to think about the future they may not have anticipated having: Mitchum, as Sheriff JP Harrah, has settled down, and Wayne, as Cole Thornton, is picking his fights with care.  Familiar faces abound in the supporting cast, and there's a nice mix of action, humor, and outstanding characters (Christopher George as villain Nelse McCloud is one of the samples of that species you ""love to hate"").  There's even a hint of romance, not only in the quirky relationship between James Caan as ""Mississippi"" Trehearne and Michele Carey as Joey MacDonald, but in the long history between Cole and saloonowner Maudie (Charlene Holt).  I couldn't begin to guess how many times I've rewatched this movie, and I still enjoy it just as much.",1035331200,18,1316,4.8053097345132745

I watched this classic with my dad one day,and I loved it,after seeing it I became a fan of both Wayne and Mitchum at the age of 9,pretty good for someone who grew up in the time of Star Wars,Star Trek and Terminator. This as to be one of my favourite movies with The Duke right behind,The Quiet Man and True Grit. And other then those two,there some other familler faces in this great movie directed by Howard Hawks. I recamend this movie not only to Wayne and Mitchum fans,but to western fans in general.",1029196800,,608,4.25
136343,4,0792110188,"Like the other reviewer said, I can't put my finger exactly on why this is not just my favorite Western but one of my favorite movies.  I think it's because the actors are so obviously having a good time with the characters they portray.  That, and the script is just plain engaging.  The characters bounce wisecracks off each other throughout the movie, which provides a lot of good humor and gives the movie an easy ""buddy"" feel that you get from movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  The story is simple, but there are twists to the white hats vs. black hats routine that keep the viewer wondering how it will all wind up.  The cinematography is also good...I find myself looking at the colors and lighted areas in the nighttime scenes because it is so warm-looking.  There are some flaws...for example, John Wayne's character is stricken by occasional paralysis when a bullet in his back ""presses against something.""  This happens a couple of times in the movie, yet James Caan's character asks,""What is it, Cole?"" when it happens for the second time, well after it has all been explained to him.  That aside, and some other things too, I love this movie.  If you want a John Wayne movie that is a good story with no axes to grind, a movie that shows him at his best, and one with an excellent supporting cast, then this is the one.  Even my wife liked it, and she is not a John Wayne fan.  This movie is simply my favorite.  I have watched this movie since I was a kid in the 70s.  I own a VHS copy, and the first movie I'll buy when I upgrade to DVD will be El Dorado.",1028764800,2,1585,4.350340136054422
136344,5,0792110188,"Director Howard Hawks and John Wayne would essentially remake the same story three times: first as RIO BRAVO in 1959, then as EL DORADO in 1967, and finally as RIO LOBO in 1970.  Caught between the popularity of the first and the dismal failure of the third, EL DORADO is something of a neglected film--but for my money, it is easily the best of the three.

The story is the stuff that Western myths are made of.  Aging gun-slinger John Wayne is offered a job as hired gun in a range war, but he discovers that acceptance of the job would place him on the wrong side of the law--which in this case is old friend and small town sheriff Robert Mitchum, who has made himself a laughing stock by drinking his way to the bottom of every bottle he can find.  Wayne accordingly drifts into town, whips Mitchum into shape, and with the assistance of crotchety deputy Arthur Hunnicutt and youngster James Caan they set about cleaning up the town.

Although EL DORADO has a leisurely tone, but it never feels in the least slow--largely due to an unexpectedly witty script that crackles with memorable dialogue (at one point when Mitchum asks Wayne what he's looking at, Wayne responds ""A tin star with a drunk pinned to it"") and unexpected situations (such as Caan's unfortunate way with a shotgun.)  The entire cast handles both humor and old-west action with equal skill, and both Wayne and Mitchum offer some the best work of their impressive careers here; James Caan (in his first major success), Arthur Hunnicutt, Charlene Holt, and  Michele Carey are equally memorable.

There are a great many westerns more critically acclaimed than EL DORADO--RED RIVER, THE SEARCHERS, and STAGE COACH to name but a few.  And I enjoy them.  But EL DORADO is like meeting an old friend whose company you always enjoy.  Strongly recommended.

136346,5,0792110188,"This is one of the best Westerns ever made.  John Wayne delivers his usual grand performance as Cole Thornton, a hired gun who carries a fearsome reputation.  Robert Mitchum almost upstages him as drunken Sheriff J.P. Harrah, Thornton's old friend.  These two exchange some of the greatest dialogue of all-time, and viewers can see that their relationship dates back a considerable amount of time.
James Caan is terrific as the kid who's a better shot with a knife than a sawed-off shotgun.  ""I hit the sign, and the sign hit him"" is one of the funnier parts in the movie and still makes me laugh.  Arthur Hunnicutt is the old geezer whose fiery spirit and witty comments provide a few laughs as well.
Ed Asner and Christopher George deliver believable performances as villians Bart Jason and Nelse MacLeod, respectively.  Great heroes, villains, sidekicks, dialogue, humor, and action make El Dorado a film worth seeing.  Besides, it's a John Wayne movie, how can you go wrong?",1012867200,,978,4.890909090909091

136348,4,0792110188,"This picture was shot in Academy ratio (which approximates TV), not widescreen format, and Hawks composed his shots in that format.  The picture was shown in theaters by using a ""matte"", which cuts the top and bottom of the picture off to imitate Panavision.  Therefore, the ""widescreen"" DVD actually reduces the amount of picture area (just compare it to the full screen VHS print: you get the same width of picture, but the top and bottom are cut off and the composition looks wrong.)  El Dorado looks much better in full screen format, so buy the VHS.  The same is true of films like Batman, Jurassic Park and The Lost World.

136349,2,0792110188,"""El Dorado"" is so hokey, one has to wonder if John Wayne was attempting a self-parody. Seriously, a film featuring Wayne, Robert Mitchum and James Caan should feature some great lines and excellent interaction. Alas, the story is tepid. Near as I can figure Wayne, Mitchum and Caan who (lamentably) are all on the same side, become involved in the classic struggle of some good ranchers vs. some bad ranchers. Though on the basis of what's on the screen, I had a hard time figuring out why I should really care which side won. Ed Asner plays the head of the villinous group, but he does so little on screen that its difficult to fathom why he's the bad guy. Caan is largley wasted in the role of the young knife thrower Wayne takes under his wing. After a couple of good early scenes, he sort of fades into the background. The subplot about Mitchum's drinking is laughable and Wayne struts through the movie as if he's phoning in his performance.
Much of the second half of the film is spent with our heros holed up at the jailhouse against the forces of evil. To get information and supplies, they keep sneaking out the back door and THE BAD GUYS NEVER CATCH ON TO THIS. Overall, this hokey Western is barely worth the time it takes to watch.",988848000,,1243,4.456140350877193
136350,5,0792110188,"I'm 53 years old and have loved John Wayne since first seeing him at the movies as ""Hondo"" as a boy. I loved Rio Bravo, but have to give the edge to this remake.  As good as the original was, El Dorado is more enjoyable and convincing to me.  The Duke is as good as he ever was in his usual role as the hired gun with a conscience whose reputation alone strikes fear into the hearts of the bad guys.  Few western actresses could match the young Angie Dickinson in Rio Bravo, but the male supporting cast is better in El Dorado.  Mitchum is excellent, young James Caan adds charm and humor and Arthur Hunnicutt nearly steals the show in the Walter Brennan role as Mitchum's loyal, but crusty deputy, Bull.  For my money, Hunnicutt is one of the great homespun character actors of all time and this is certainly one of his very best performances.  Most don't know his name like they do the great Walter Brennan's but he's just as good or better.  A then noname Ed Asner and Christopher George (TV's The Rat Patrol) are excellent as the main bad guys.  George is actually somewhat likeable as a man willing to sell his gun to the most odious of crooks, but still possessed of a sense of fair play.  Jim Davis (Jock Ewing of TV's Dallas) plays one of Asner's henchmen.  This is just a great cast telling a great old west story.
A recent biography of director Howard Hawks points out that Hawks badly needed a hit late in his career when El Dorado was put together.  His effort is evident.  Even the opening credits are great--a series of beautiful western paintings by Olaf Wieghorst, who also appears as the gunsmith, ""The Swede.""  The title song by George Alexander is memorable as well.
BTW, the poem Caan keeps quoting, which serves as the foundation for the title song, was Edgar Alan Poe's last poem--""El Dorado"", of course.  The movie was filmed just west of Tucson, AZ in what is today Old Tucson--a must tour for anyone interested in westerns. Westerns are still filmed there.  Movies filmed there include Rio Bravo, El Dorado, McClintock, and Rio Lobo by Wayne, as well as many others such as Joe Kidd, Tombstone and even The Three Amigos.",983664000,86,2145,4.492268041237113
136351,4,0792110188,"This movie still remains one of my favorite westerns.  John Wayne, in fine form, plays his stock character, the Rattlesnake-quick hired gunfighter, but with one problem--A bullet in his back from an old injury causes paralysis in his gun hand at the most inopportune moments.  In the end, he is forced to resort to trickery to defeat the villian of the piece, another hired gunfighter played with icy calmness by Christopher George.  The Duke begins to show his age in this movie, but just like fine wine he only seems to improve as he gets older.  Also included is the unforgettable Robert Mitchum, as the sheriff on a full-fledged drunken bender.  The two actors complement each other quite well, although sometimes it seems they compete for the camera.  Also included in the cast is a very young (but still unmistakable) James Caan, the beautiful Charlene Holt as The Duke's long-suffering girlfriend, and Arthur Hunnicut as the noisy, loveable old coot who, along with Caan's character, provides some strong comic relief.  If you don't recognize either of those last two names, don't worry--I didn't either.  Note to parents:  While there is a lot of gunplay and fistfighting in this movie, remember, it was made back in the 60's--blood and gore are kept to a minimum.",982281600,10,1272,4.906542056074766

John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, James Caan, Arthur Hunnicutt and Christopher George are all excellent thanks to Hawks' bawdy direction and Leigh Brackett's fun script full of homespun dialogue. Howard Hawks was really a master at building up characterizations as a way of moving the most simple of plots to deliver a good piece of entertainment. He was also a master of balancing good action scenes with humorous situations and character interplay as this film also proves. There is great camaraderie among all the actors in this film that really comes across. This is a good film. I highly recommend it.",979171200,,710,5.068376068376068

Howard Hawks was so impressed with James Caan who played his ""Mississippi"" role with absolute solemnity, saying that it made his character even more believable during the films many humorous moments. Robert Mitchum is superb, as are Christopher George and Ed Asner, but make no mistake this film belongs to John Wayne. His trademark laconic tough guy style oozes throughout the picture, and as predictable as the movie is, it is an absolute joy to watch over and over again.

136357,5,0792110188,"This film is my favorite Hawks movie, the one I enjoy the most.  It does  necessary means it's his most IMPORTANT in term of film history, (HIS GIRL  FRIDAY and RED RIVER should be considered his highest achievement, in that  sense); many would just say it's a remake of RIO BRAVO, one of his most  popular film.
But I actually enjoy EL DORADO more than RIO BRAVO because  of its playfulness. It is perhaps not the story itself is interesting, but  the way Hawks tells it and Wayne and Mitchum (two of my favorite  super-heroes, I must say) acting it. They fill the movie with a lot of  humor; not only the comic relief James Caan and Arthur Hunnicut who are  funny, but Wayne and Mitchum may get even more laugh than these  two.
There's nothing fancy about Hawks's direction in this film, but  everything is done so natural, casual and indeed perfect, which is, I  think, only a great master of this trade can achieve.
EL DORADO has  actually more dramatic element than RIO BRAVO, and these dramas are  actually far more carefully constructed to make the story more interesting  than in RIO BRAVO. For instance, Wayne's and Mitchum's camaraderie is  colored with a tint of old age: not only that Mitchum is a drunk alcoholic  (as Dean Martin in RIO BRAVO) but Wayne also becomes crippled. The  motivation of revenge gives the strength to this basically entertaining  plot. And these dramatic darker themes do not interfere with the enjoyment  of the story, which is amazing with Hawks, but rather reinforce the  excitement of it.
The new transfer is quite brilliant. It captures the  richness and depth of the original  IB-Technicolor print.  If you have  already seen the VHS edition, panned-and-scanned and with shallow colors,  you haven't really seen this film. With this DVD, you can enjoy the  masterful direction of Hawks, the beautiful score by Nelson Riddle (I think  the song is very good), and the harmony of performances of those incredible  actors who can become those characters just by being in front of camera  repeatedly. It's really one of the most enjoyable, entertaining movie ever  coming out from Hollywood.",968457600,4,2130,4.798342541436464

Great performances all around, but especially Wayne and  Guest.  I'll quibble with the last reviewer: Mitchum is great but the Duke  is so large that he pushes everyone else out of the screen.

  Later, Thornton is in  another town, where he meets up with Nils McCloud (Christopher George), who  is off to El Dorado to take the job Thornton turned down.  McCloud tells  Thornton that Harrah is now a hopeless drunk, so of course, this being a  Wayne flick, Thornton has to ride to the rescue.

""El Dorado"" is a tighter, better-scripted film  running  only 127 minutes. By comparison, ""Rio Bravo"" goes on forever with its leisurely 2-hour length.

Problem here is that most of this movie is shot during night  scenes, so lighting would have to be dim.  What Paramount failed to  recognize was that they needed to ""brighten"" up the picture some.  The few day scenes were in great condition, and the soundtrack is  excellent.  As for the plot, it's a loose reworking of Rio Bravo, and it is  just as good.  In my opinion, this was the last movie that John Wayne made  as a nimble action hero.  From here on, he eased into more senior roles.  One last note, I own a 50"" projection screen TV, so naturally the  picture is darker that a tube.  My brightness was turned up full.  But on a  tube, the picture will be brighter.

Looks like no one else guessed who Bart Jason was -  an early film role played with the usual gruffiness by Ed Asner, who later went on to fame in the Mary Tyler Moore  show and then in his own show as Lou Grant.  Right from the start of the  film, when Charlene Holt, who plays Maudie, reminisces with Mitch about  John Wayne (Cole), you see Mitch's head in side profile, like an Easter  Island statue or Mount Rushmore.  James Caan turned in a fine performance  as Mississippi, gunslinger, medicine man, and Romeo (love interest Michele  Carey).  Pre-""The Immortal"" Christopher George was also excellent  as Asner's hired hand, the ""professional courtesy"" gun duel btw.
