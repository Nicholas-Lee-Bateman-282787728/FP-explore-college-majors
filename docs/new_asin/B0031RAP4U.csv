8387197,5,B0031RAP4U,"Wow! Where is this wonderful continuing story. I have a need for more. I would like to see the story continue. The acting was absolutely fabulous. The actors were very believeable and all the stoylines fit right in. Of course Roy Dupuis never fails to deliver and it was an excellent job as usual. I love watching him in the different rolls I have seen him in so far. He is my favorite French-Canadian actor in the whole world! As I always say those eyes and that voice. I could look and listen to him all day. Where are you ROY, I need to see more of you.",1348358400,,556,4.157407407407407
