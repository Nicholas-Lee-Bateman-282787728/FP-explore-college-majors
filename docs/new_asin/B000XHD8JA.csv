8228268,4,B000XHD8JA,"Not a bad documentary, as a big fan of Ghost Hunting, it shows alot of fellow hunters and their experiences in the field.",1229385600,2,121,4.304347826086956
8228269,2,B000XHD8JA,"I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing this documentary, and despite the somewhat negative reviews, I bought it anyways. I am a huge fan of the paranormal, and gave it a try when I saw a few familiar faces. I wish I had not ordered it, because the first 2/3 of the movie bored me to tears. It was mostly historical theory, nothing like I thought it would be. If you want to see paranormal investigators in action, I'd recommend purchasing Ghost Hunters, or something like Spooked: the Ghost of Waverly Hills.",1225670400,,515,4.48936170212766
8228270,3,B000XHD8JA,"The gentleman who narrates it does not do a particularily good job.  The rest of the movie is actually really good and goes into a good bit of history about ghost hunting and provides some of the details you will need if you want to go looking for ghosts.  Again, it is not the greatest movie ever made, but I think it is a must if you are going to look for ghosts.",1224633600,,365,3.9863013698630136
8228271,5,B000XHD8JA,This DVD is awesome!  Would make a great learning tool for new paranormal investigators!,1213574400,,88,5.285714285714286
8228272,2,B000XHD8JA,"I'm a big fan of John Zaffis, TAPS, and straightforward, logical paranormal investigators like them. Having read nearly every ""true"" paranormal book on the market (and many that are out of print that I had to find used), I have to say this DVD was a big disappointment. If you press [Play] knowing absolutely nothing about the paranormal or about investigation, maybe you'll find this interesting, but I really felt I had wasted my money as it went over such basic concepts. Along with one of the other reviewers, I also disliked the cheesy audio and graphics and was bothered by things like the misspelling of ""exorcist."" Why don't more publishers and filmmakers pay a proofreader to check these things out? It's half an hour's work... Anyway, if you're well-read in the paranormal field and know a lot about ghost-hunting, this is a waste of money and time. If you're new to it and want an introduction from some people who know a bit about what they're doing, you might enjoy it.",1211587200,10,982,4.715116279069767
8228273,5,B000XHD8JA,"My sister and I have been ghost hunting for over 6 years, and one of the things that has always bothered us is the way television and movies can distort the facts or even ignore important information just to gain a little more excitement or suspense. Well this dvd was able to keep the interest and remain extremely informative without taking sides. Which I love! People should be allowed to make up their own minds and not be forced by Hollywood to believe one way or another.  I also loved how much information they were able to include on one disc. It's actually a great movie to watch if you want to learn about all the aspects of ghost hunting or even how to gather evidence etc.

One thing I really liked was that they went a bit into the history of ghost hunting which you never really see in films like this (and believe me I have quite a collection!) I even learned a few things. :P It has real people from real groups and even a few celebrities which is a nice surprise! (I've always been a huge fan of Steve Gonsalves ;-)  I hope they make another disc in a series!  Awesome job!!

8228274,2,B000XHD8JA,"The key to this paranormal documentary is to put a realistic spin on it by validating the fact that there is little proof (or none) that most paranormal activity exists.  The ""skeptical"" ghost hunters and the full-blown believers balance each other out nicely to attempt to convince the viewer that maybe this isn't all just a nice little hobby.  Hey, if a ghost hunting skeptic isn't so sure, then when they do see, hear, feel something is must be a ghost!

Unfortunately, once again, there is no proof.

This film begins with a truly irritating narration that attempts to put a ""eerie"" vincent-price type feel to the documentary.  It comes out more like someone reading from cue cards that doesn't know which words to emphasize.

Back and forth interviews with ""demonologists"" and ""excorcists"" (sic in the film), ghost hunters, psychics, blah blah blah, continues to drag the documentary further down into the realm of unbelievability.  You just can't help but think it's all staged or personally willed for effect.  We know these folks want to believe something is out there but the sheer fact is that there is no actual proof.  Anyone, scientist or not can easily find many reasons for what these folks experience.

The ""documentary"" finally hits rock bottom by complaining that they can't find ghosts because the science community won't make them ghost finders.  They continue other threads such as 'digital recorders pick up more evp's'.  Seemingly ridiculous statements like 'I use two recorders because if I get an evp on only one then it must be real.'  Yeah, so, ghosts only pick one digital recorder to speak to.  Hey, maybe you're right.

And on and on with the orbs (dust, lens flares, bad optics, etc) and all that silly stuff.

Call a spade a spade.  These folks are having fun chasing things they think are real.  It's when it becomes absolutely illogical where they lose me.  If someone could only make a documentary that cuts the crap with the eerie music and the mandatory hour of bad quality green infrared video (and lest we not forget the stellar narration) and stick to the facts perhaps this film would probably be less entertaining, but it would also be shelved in the documentary section.

Then again, is it really a documentary when you don't know what you're documenting?",1203033600,6,2299,4.846153846153846
8228275,5,B000XHD8JA,"I too am a fellow paranormal investigator for a team in Pennsylvania called The Southwestern Pennsylvania League of Apparition Technologists.  I cannot recommend this documentary enough.  This was well thought out and well researched.  It also covers many different views on ghost research.  You won't be dissapointed by the quality of this video.  It's not over dramatised or quickly edited, but it is to the point and educational.  I hope this documentary team continues with this topic and makes others in a series.  Great Job.",1200182400,14,530,5.1647058823529415
8228276,5,B000XHD8JA,"What I liked about this film is that they were able to cover all the subjects without over doing it. It's technically a long movie but never gets boring. It's also good that the film makers didn't take sides and left the opinions up to the audience. I bought a few ghost docs on Amazon that were really one sided (either for or against) and overdone with effects and it's usually hard to differentiate between the facts and the directors opinions, but they did a great job here. Also, John Zaffis and Steve Gansalves are always a pleasure to listen to and the ouija board possession scene is awesome!",1195430400,18,600,4.513761467889908
