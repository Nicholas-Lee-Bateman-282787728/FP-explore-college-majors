8705077,5,B00UAYV0AU,"There is a big difference between the Blu-ray version and the DVD. On my 48"" Samsung HD television screen, I am able to see details that are obvious:
.
1. Looking at the facial closeups, especially the old nuns, the observer is able to view individual hair strands with their different shades and colors. Some are mis-combed. Cosmetics also fail to hide pimples, wrinkles, blemishes, brown spots, and pores.
.
2. Individual stitches on Maria's hat are observable. Likewise, her nun's jacket exhibits various folds and creases, stitchings, and worn ends.
.
I am not able to see the above on the DVD version.",1466640000,,606,4.836538461538462
