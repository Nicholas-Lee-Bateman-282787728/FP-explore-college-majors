8716598,1,B00XU99NRE,"I'm giving this item a 1-star review for one simple reason: the item title is misleading. This is not a 4k Ultra HD Blu-ray. It's a standard 1080p HD Blu-ray. It was filmed in 4k, but then down-converted to 1080p. The item title is misleading because it only mentions the ""filmed in 4k resolution"" and no where in the item description does it disclaim that it's being ""presented in 1080p resolution."" It's up to the buyer to figure out that this is 1080p HD due to the fact that it's a ""Blu-ray"" and not an ""Ultra HD Blu-ray.""",1462665600,9,526,4.377551020408164
