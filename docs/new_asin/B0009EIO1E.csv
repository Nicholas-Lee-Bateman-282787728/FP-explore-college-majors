8059421,1,B0009EIO1E,"This pseudo promotion tries to capitalize on the popularity of Forrest Griffin by selling this DVD with his face on the cover. The picture on the cover of the DVD is not even from his actual fight with Travis Fulton. It is misleading and disingenuous. That would be like putting a picture of a hot dog on a cooking book about hamburgers. I want my money back.

This DVD is not worth the money. The talent is ""C"" level at best. Some guy taps out to shoulder pressure!! That is how lame the fights are. Don't waste your money!",1272672000,,524,4.292929292929293
