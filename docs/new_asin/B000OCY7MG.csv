8184720,3,B000OCY7MG,"Daryl Wilson (Richard Carroll) is a NYC NARC working undercover, busting and killing crack dealers. Killing bothers him. He takes meds, sees a shrink and a ghost named Reggie Carter, a guy he once killed in the line of duty. He is attempting to make a big bust as Reggie gives him advice.

This is a different type of urban film. Almost watchable. 3 stars for the effort and creating a story line with a different plot. Film was release earlier as ""Ghost City.""

Guide: F-word. Minor groping. Implied sex. No nudity.",1468627200,,516,4.5978260869565215
