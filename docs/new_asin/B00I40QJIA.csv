6248773,1,B00I40QJIA,"Just so we're clear, that one-star rating is NOT directed at the cartoons featured on this DVD; Bugs Bunny cartoons are always enjoyable to watch. Rather, this one-star rating is against the disc itself, and the DVD series it is part of, the ""[character] and Friends"" line. The problem with these ""[character] and Friends"" DVDs is that it's nothing but a bunch of reissues of older DVDs with new labels put on them. For example, this particular DVD is actually the first disc of the first Looney Tunes Golden Collection. If you have that DVD set (and if you ARE a Looney Tunes fan, chances are you do), then you already have this DVD, so there's no reason to waste $10 on this release.

Why is Warner Home Video doing this?! Are they in such bad financial shape that they HAVE to stoop to reissuing their older cartoon DVDs and calling them new releases, in hopes that we don't realize that we, as fans of the featured material, have likely already bought the disc the first time it was available? I'm certainly not fooled, and surely anyone who's a fan of the cartoons (who has likely bought the previous releases) wouldn't be fooled either. Frankly, a much better idea would be if Warner Home Video continued with those Cartoon Network Hall of Fame DVDs they started making back in 2009, or releasing DVD sets of their 1990s/2000 cartoons they haven't already released, like Histeria! and Detention (I know those would probably sell better than the Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain set that came out in January). Those would be releases I would support, but the ""[character] and Friends"" line is something I will never waste money on.",1395705600,28,1631,4.682926829268292
6248774,3,B00I40QJIA,"There is so much that could be said about Bugs Bunny. He was named the greatest cartoon character by TV Guide in 2002, and yet his cartoons still have brought out so many generations in laughter. There also have been so many different Looney Tunes collections that have been made about the wascally wabbit throughout the years. But nothing could be said about the love that Bugs Bunny has brought to so many generations in fun with the Looney Tunes gang. He has shown it very well, but with Warner Brothers releases of many of his cartoons over and over again, without anything different from most of the collections, there isn't that much that has changed for die hard Bugs Bunny fans.

Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny & Friends isn't actually a new collection of smash Bugs Bunny cartoons. The collection mostly chose cartoons from past Looney Tunes: Golden Collections. The shorts have been remastered well, but not anything that makes it better from past Bugs Bunny compilations like Hare Extraordinare from the Looney Tunes: Super Stars collection from 2010. There are still funny shorts like Big Top Bunny, where Bugs tries to make it in the circus, but feels troubled by a jealous bear who wants the spotlight for himself, and Ballot Box Bunny where Bugs and Yosemite Sam fight for a mayoral position, after Sam threaten to get rid of every last rabbit like Bugs. The shorts here are remastered well, and bring in a lot of laughs,

Overall, when you do get a great compilation of Looney Tunes: Cartoons, you do get a good one for what you pay for, but sadly this one isn't the case. Bugs Bunny & Friends isn't a bad buy for new Looney Tunes fans, but not really anything worth the money for hard core fans that still are awaiting more for the money and the looney laugh. If you are new to the wild wabbit, this would be a noble starter gift, but not really worth the money overall.

Shorts: Baseball Bugs, Rabbit Seasoning, Long-Haired Hare, High Diving Hare, Bully For Bugs, What's Up Doc?, Rabbit's Kin, Water Water Every Hare, Big House Bunny, Big Top Bunny, Wabbit Twouble, Ballot Box Bunny, Rabbit Of Seville

6248823,5,B00I40QJIA,"Bugs Bunny and Friends is not a pointless reissue, and it is not disguised as a new release, as a previous reviewer has stated.  What is  wrong with issuing a DVD with just Bugs Bunny cartoons?  Does Warner Brothers have a plot to mislead or fool cartoon fans?  Huh?  I don't think so!  I wonder if the previous reviewer ever considered that there are Bugs Bunny fans out there who don't want to have to purchase an expensive DVD collection (loaded with cartoons of the other WB characters) just to obtain the Bugs cartoons.  Warner Brothers isn't trying to fool anyone.  What they are attempting to do is offer the consumer (who wants a DVD with only Bugs cartoons) less expensive options.",1404864000,25,690,4.598360655737705
