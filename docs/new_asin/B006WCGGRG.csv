5023822,2,B006WCGGRG,A farce poorly executed is usually worse than an inadvertently farcical bad movie. That is the case here. I'm sorry I wasted my time.,1378166400,,133,4.583333333333333
5023823,1,B006WCGGRG,"saw the first 15minutes and gave up. horrible video quality and just plain dumb. if you want spy spoofs check out james Coburn as OUR MAN FLINT or dean martin as MATT HELM. for a cerebral spoof, check out alec guiness in OUR MAN IN HAVANA (I think that is the correct title, look under alec guiness films).",1369785600,,306,4.293103448275862

8505523,1,B006WCGGRG,"Weak imitation of a ""James Bond"" flick in which even the villains lack plausibility. Photographic quality too low even for an attempted spoof.  Bored out of watching after 43 minutes.",1479340800,,183,5.1

8505530,3,B006WCGGRG,"THE MAN FROM S.E.X. is two things. Thing #1- A very silly James Bond parody. Thing #2-  An excuse to show a little bit of female nudity (VERY little considering the title!). It has the suave super-spy known as Charles Bind, and the utterly eeevil super-villain called Lucifer Orchid. Of course, the beautiful woman in distress is in need of Bind's assistance. Her name? Lotta Muff. The karate fight scenes are horrible, the dialogue and plot are inane, and the ""humor"" is mostly lacking any actual mirth. It was fun to see Deep Roy in an early role, dressed in black, and wielding a bullwhip! To be honest, there were some fun characters, and I caught myself almost laughing a couple of times, so it wasn't a total waste. Overall however, it was a rather dull affair. This is what our forefathers watched in those grungy theaters in the 70s...",1390780800,,843,4.62
