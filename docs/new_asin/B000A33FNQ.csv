2354723,1,B000A33FNQ,"Okay, I have heard a lot about the film and I'm dying to see it.  I think Eduardo Noriega is an amazing actor.  The one star is not for the movie but for the review on it.  I just have to respond to the other reviewer.  What exactly is ETA's story?  Blowing up cars and killing innocent people?  The Basque are in no way being oppressed in today's Spain.  ETA are a small bunch of terrorist radicals that want to impose their ideals on a larger group of people.  Just ask the Basque.",1146182400,2,483,4.118279569892473

8073535,5,B000A33FNQ,"This film is both riveting and tense as it details the undercover work of a young Basque who is challenged by the methods ETA employed in the 1970's to reach their stated political ends. caught in the middle, the Spanish authorities use and exploit him as much as the other side. there are no innocents in this game of cat and mouse, both sides are users and abusers. As the aspirations of the Basque people continue to be expressed even today, this look into the history of violence and terror is illustrative .of how movements and governments often become exploitative in attempting to fulfill their own ends.",1358985600,,611,4.719626168224299
8073536,5,B000A33FNQ,"If you loved, as I and my two 17-year olds did, Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" aka ""Infiltrados,"" this story of a ""mole"" within the Basque terrorist movement ETA will give you much of the same nail-biting excitement. Of course there are bad guys and not so bad guys, a bit like in those ""tough-guy"" French films, but in fact this film rises to the level of the best American films of the last several years, and is highly recommended. If you can manage to see it in Spanish with English subtitles, the level of tension may be even greater.",1280707200,,535,4.469387755102041
8073537,5,B000A33FNQ,"Una de las mejores peliculas en exponer el movimiento ETA de una manera realistica y personal contrastando percepciones sociopoliticas extremistas con individualistas y humanistas. Las actuaciones de todos en el elenco compuesto de Eduardo Noriega, Patrick Bruel, Jos Coronado y la francesa Mlanie Doutey son esplendidos. Lo unico perturbador es la peluca rubia de Eduardo Noriega que en uno de sus camuflajes le hace brillar en todas las penumbras de sus escondites. PERO AUN ASI, MAGNIFICA!",1257465600,3,492,5.4868421052631575
8073538,5,B000A33FNQ,"""El Lobo"" is a tense, fast paced thriller from Spain based on the true story of Mikel ""Txema"" Lejarza  (Eduardo Noriega), a Basque man with a young family, who finds the direction of his life irrevocably altered when he does a favor for a friend.

The film is well made and well acted.  The director uses a framing device in which the film actually begins near the end of the story and then goes back in time to reconstruct how this young man inadvertently became ""El Lobo"" an undercover agent involved with the ETA (bloody Basque separatist movement) during the mid-seventies.

Awakened in the middle of the night by a knock on the door, Txema agrees to allow a couple of ETA members to hide out in his apartment for a few hours.  Although he is reluctant to let these men into his home, he knows it would be worth his life to say ""no.""

From his uninvited guests, Txema learns that the ETA has targeted one of his neighbors for death because that man, a taxi driver, prevented a couple of kids from stealing a car.  The kids were ETA members and now the taxi driver has been accused of being an informant against the group and a traitor against their movement for independence from Spain.

Txema makes an unsuccessful effort to warn the taxi driver.  He is picked up by the police in a general round up.  When the authorities discover Txema is the man who attempted to warn the victim, they see in him a small crack in previously impenetrable ETA and the tight knit Basque community who shield them.  Ricardo (Jos Cornoado), the commissioner of the Spanish secret service makes Txema an offer he can't refuse to infiltrate the ETA and provide them information about the group's leaders and member movements.

There is danger everywhere in this movie.  The ETA members show no sentimentality when committing murders and bombing targets when they perceive it might further their cause.  The police are portrayed as equally ruthless.  Both organizations willingly torture and kill their own members who get out of line.  Eduardo Noriega gives a riveting performance as a man who can only rely on himself as he is caught between these two violent groups.  Jos Cornoado is chilling as the commissioner who is willing to put his career interests ahead of everything else.

The Region 1 DVD release is in Spanish with English subtitles.  There are no special features other than scene selection.  (The previous Region 1 & 4 DVD release is in Spanish but does NOT have English subtitles.)

Highly recommended.",1228003200,5,2503,4.708045977011494
8073539,5,B000A33FNQ,"'El Lobo' is based on the true story of Txema, a young, idealistic Basque entrepreneur. He's horrified to see the ETA becoming more and more violent, and although he's not involved with them, they involve him for small jobs. He doesn't like it, but to say 'no' to ETA is to say goodbye to your life.

One day he overhears two ETA members as they talk about killing a befriended cab driver in front of his wife and daughter. They say he's a traitor, but all the guy really did was refusing to look the other way when two ETA thugs were stealing a car. Txema is appalled by this and tries to warn the guy.

The secret service finds out about the attack, and they are curious why he risked his own life trying to warn the guy. As Txema tells them he's against the violence and killings they see the ideal opportunity to use him as an undercover 'agent'. He's intelligent, idealistic and what's more; he fits right in - unlike their trained agents.

What follows is a captivating, realistic and honest drama about the nasty politics within ETA as well as the Spanish government. The struggle of one idealistic man and one honest cop against ruthless and power hungry people on either side.

Don't make the mistake in thinking it's an ETA propaganda piece, it's not. It's actually a very honest and moving film that tries to portray things as they are.

Highly recommended!",1197849600,,1368,4.522267206477733

8073541,5,B000A33FNQ,"""El lobo"" is one of those unsaid cult movies that stand out because its solid script, engaging realism and beating actuality.

Spain, 1975. A collaborator is discovered by the police forces and then recruited as informer of every single movement of the ETA.

Since that moment his life will depend of a thread; because one little mistake will mean for him a secure death. Intriguing, absorbing, disturbing and magnificently narrated. Kudos for the cast and the magisterial direction of Miguel Curtois.",1194998400,,501,5.172839506172839
8073542,5,B000A33FNQ,Very good movie. It actually reveals the political situation in the Basque country at the end of Franco's regime. Lobo was a key in order to attempt to dismantle the organization network known as E.T.A.,1182902400,,202,4.8
