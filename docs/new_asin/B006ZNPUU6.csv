8507140,4,B006ZNPUU6,"A cute movie for fans of the ""clash of cultures"" genre. If you know someone who was frustrated that their immigrant parents sent them to the bank so the parents wouldn't have to struggle with English, or if you were a fan or similar movies like ""Bend it like Beckham"" You'll probably like this one. It is clearly a budget production. The two main characters, the mother and daughter were well acted, but as another reviewer has pointed out, a few of the supporting characters had a ""high school play"" characteristic to their performances. I also found it odd that the forth wall was broken for the first few minutes of the main character's appearance, and then never again.",1482364800,,673,4.663865546218488
8507141,1,B006ZNPUU6,"I was hoping to see something better, but the acting is really bad! The story is silly and boring, and also I was expecting to see more of Andreas Wilson, who is a great actor but he barely appears in the movie! I'm really disappointed with this movie.",1354579200,,252,4.270833333333333
