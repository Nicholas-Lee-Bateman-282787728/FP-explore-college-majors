3791476,5,B001TKK3KM,Finally after many years of silence and disinformation. BBC create Documentary move about World War II. Thank you!!!,1243296000,5,116,5.5

3791478,5,B001TKK3KM,I would say that this is probably the first time I have seen a report on the vital role the Poles played in World War II and the first to give them the credit they have long deserved.  It even intimates that Churchill does not go scot-free when it comes to the duplicitous role he played in turning them over from one tyranny to another.  Add to that his refusal to allow them to participate in the victory parade in London.,1242345600,43,424,4.222222222222222
3791479,5,B001TKK3KM,"This is 20th century history that we, as Americans, are by and large fairly ignorant of. Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and Battle of the Bulge have obscured our knowledge of the most devastating and in many ways more significant aspects of World War II on the eastern front. The dramatized sections are excellently produced and portrayed, which only the BBC seems to be able to do so well. It gives us a glimpse of the power dealing leading to some of the most violent and tragic consequences of the war. Highly recommended.",1242345600,56,515,4.670329670329671
3791480,3,B001TKK3KM,"This is a useful and creative series.  The organization is a bit uneven but there is a lot of hard information that is relevant.  The section on Churchill's 1942 meeting with Stalin was quite interesting where Churchill openly admits that the purpose of British bombing was to wipe out German cities, not just to hit military targets.

3791486,5,B001TKK3KM,"Answers a lot of questions about WW2 that remain puzzling. Turns out that the allies carved up Europe and gave Stalin what he wanted. And that was the territory he grabbed in the Nazi/Soviet pact. Very shocking that Churchill and FDR acquiesced in this, since Stalin held all the cards at then end of the war in eastern Europe. Poland was sacrificed to prevent another conflict from breaking out.",1433548800,,396,4.753623188405797
3791487,5,B001TKK3KM,Very informative.,1423440000,,17,8.0
3791488,5,B001TKK3KM,"I consider myself a bit of a WW2 buff, albeit a strictly amateur one, but this program was an eye-opener on so many levels, covering as it did much less well-known territory than is usually the case in the innumerable documentaries out there on the war. WW2: Behind Closed Doors is especially to be commended for the way it deals with the shifting - and strange - alliances, and the far from black-and-white issues, all of which are done in a remarkably even-handed way.

In particular, the dramatic re-enactments assume a high degree of historical verisimilitude by way of their relying on long secret minutes of meetings and other documents, most noteworthy being information from top-secret Soviet files not available until the early 1990s. Thus the words spoken in these reconstructions do not spring from conventional wisdom, or some filmmaker's imagination, but are based on factual material.

Behind Closed Doors isn't exactly revisionist history, but it does present a more nuanced analysis of WW2, and especially the events leading up to it and its aftermath than the usual simplistic, pop history fare we're spoon-fed via venues like the History Channel and Hollywood.

WW2 BCD doesn't quite go so far as to endorse the controversial Suvorov theory of a planned Soviet pre-emptive strike against Germany in 1941 or 1942, and that Hitler simply beat Stalin to the punch by attacking the Soviet Union first. Indeed, the documentary more or less endorses the consensus view that the Soviet Union was ill prepared for war, and that Stalin rejected the idea of a Soviet sneak attack. But there is the admission that formerly friendly relations between the two countries had cooled considerably even as early as Autumn of 1940. It also doesn't leave out the inconvenient fact that, as agreed to in the secret protocols of the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact in August 1939, the USSR invaded Poland from the East only a couple weeks after Germany did so from the West in September 1939. As a result, Britain declared war on Germany - but not on the Soviet Union.

From a purely aesthetic standpoint, WW2 BCD is practically a textbook in how to balance documentary and dramatic elements. All the actors are good but of course the standout portrayal is Stalin by the Russian film star Alexei Petrenko. It would be an exaggeration to say Petrenko's is a sympathetic portrait, but he does embody the subtleties of Stalin's persona and character exceptionally well, even, as has been pointed out, if the actor isn't quite right physically for Stalin.

It might be fair to say that, for better or worse, these programs present the events of WW2 from Stalin's point of view, and with a resultant pro-Stalin slant, specifically portraying him as the guy who stared down Hitler while at the same time finessing Churchill and Roosevelt, who are generally depicted as conniving, misleading, and equivocating, doing their best to handle Uncle Joe while seemingly oblivious to how well he was managing them. But what comes through ultimately in Petrenko's take is the overwhelming force of Stalin's personality and his highly personal, take-no-prisoners leadership style, in contrast to Roosevelt and Churchill, both of whom tended more toward charm and cajoling to get their way.

One minor quibble with WW2 BCD might be that a goodly amount of the previously screened scenes are repeated exactly in flashbacks, giving the impression of padding. Moreover, as some reviewers have pointed out, there are omissions and, if you will, biases. But what we have is excellent, both in style and content. WW2 BCD can be recommended as a companion work to Norman Davies excellent book No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe, 1939-1945. Both give us a much needed counter point of view to the usual, simplistic histories of World War 2. Five stars.",1423440000,,3830,5.004709576138148

3791493,5,B001TKK3KM,"I read the book and caught the series many moons ago on public TV. It reveals an aspect to WWII that largely goes unknown. My evaluation - Poland was majorly screwed by all of the Allies during WWII. Originally, I hoped that the documentary would be available via Netflix or iTunes. Alas, I ordered the DVD. The content of the DVD is great and it follows the book to a T. Highly recommend for WWII buffs.",1400630400,,404,4.328947368421052
3791494,4,B001TKK3KM,"I don't normally enjoy documentary series that feature dramatized scenes, yet I found this English series very impressive. It's very pro-Polish outlook is highly unusual for a UK or US show, and it does convey the suffing of that nation before and after the war. It also leads to it being very anti- the Western Allies, which again is an unusual viewpoint. Stalin comes across as shrewder and stronger than Churchill or Roosevelt, so I'l like to know what its creator, Laurence Rees, makes of Harry S Truman.",1398902400,,508,4.784090909090909

This was a very informative documentary!  I still cannot believe we were friendly with Stalin!",1386806400,,186,5.607142857142857
3791496,5,B001TKK3KM,Poland has the same problem as Korea to strong neighbors: Russia and Germany. Poland has been their battleground since the earliest of times and suffered for it. I continue read the about the hatred that Poles have towards Churchill and Roosevelt over the post-war agreements. I am sorry about I support Roosevelt and Churchill in their policies towards the USSR during war. The Soviets were killing thousands of German soldiers which assisted the west in Italian and French Campaigns. Millions of Russians suffered under both Hitler and Stalin but it was their determination that help defeat Germany. Stalin was a murdering gangster there is not doubt it but he was unfortunate ally. As to the post-war settlements the red army was in Poland and there WAS NOTHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ABOUT IT.,1364688000,,800,4.977611940298507
3791497,5,B001TKK3KM,"With a perfectly cast Stalin, this series gives you arguably the most important information on these events - ow things felt. The atmosphere of the meetings. This is important in gauging the character of a tyrant. Of course, this provides profound factual data in chronolgical order too. Recommended.",1360540800,2,300,5.270833333333333
3791498,4,B001TKK3KM,Unusual program series that focus on each of the various leaders of each nation. I truly like this a lot and it gave us new perspectives and information. - Prof Michael Haller,1358208000,,175,4.5
3791499,5,B001TKK3KM,Im not going to get into much details but this DVD was great. The information given and the production itself is superb. Now can anyone help me find one with spanish subs? so i can send it to my cousin in Cuba? they see Stalin as a hero over there. i want him to learn the truth.,1347321600,,279,3.912280701754386
3791500,5,B001TKK3KM,I read the book and then watched the DVD. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the DVD so much. I learned things I didn't know and I thought the acting was superb. I will watch it more than once.,1331424000,,200,4.025
3791501,1,B001TKK3KM,Hardly any real footage. It is mainly a description of the war on the eastern front alongside with scenes by actors. This is NOT a documentary.,1324598400,,143,4.538461538461538
3791502,5,B001TKK3KM,"I was born in 1940 and always remembered how my Polish mother used to say how much she hated the Russians. Her parents fled Poland before all this began, and they were smart doing so.

While I have studied WW2 for 50 years, I must admit I never really knew how bad the Russians were toward Poland during WW2.
They were about the same as the Nazis, but Stalin, I think, was even more vicious than Hitler...if that's possible.

Well, now I know that my Mother was right. It was painful watching but superbly done.

PS Please don't write me and say that all the Russians were not as bad as Stalin like all the Germans were not like Hitler.
But, they surely loved what was happening when things were going their way! Watch the new films during that time",1319155200,7,749,4.335714285714285
3791503,4,B001TKK3KM,"There were a lot of very important details left out of this film. Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt were all three given a pass on many things. I was, however, amazed at how much was revealed. Roosevelt's knowledge of and willingness to cover up Stalin's crimes, for example, is something I never saw once in 16 years of American approved schooling. With respect to Churchill, well you know, BBC is state owned. I can hardly blame the director for wanting the film to actually be broadcast. For all that, it wasn't too bad. His betrayal of the Polish was made to look as though he were simply outmaneuvered by Stalin which I suppose was partly true. A more factual and condemning portrayal of the Soviet Union and Stalin can be found in the DVD set ""The Soviet Story"" by Edvins Stone. Stalin killed millions of his own people before the war, and make no mistake, both Churchill and Roosevelt were well aware of this. They knew full well the fate of the people in the countries they allowed Stalin to keep, helped him to obtain. Finally, I should mention Truman and the atomic bomb. BBC made no mention of the fact the Japanese agreed to surrender BEFORE the first bomb was dropped. The ONLY condition of the surrender was that the emperor be allowed to keep his honorary title, a condition which was still honored after Truman murder thousands of civilians, in many opinions solely to impress/scare Stalin. Overall, though, it's a film well worth watching, especially if your education is primarily from state funded schools.",1312502400,2,1523,4.750943396226415
3791504,5,B001TKK3KM,"This is a no holds barred, true story, about Stalin, WWII, and his interactions with Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler, and his different generals.
  No one comes out smelling like a rose in this honest portrayal of WWII. Russia, under Stalin, did the Lion`s share of the fighting required to defeat Nazi Germany. Never the less Stalin was a brutal dictator who cared not at all about the men and women he sacroffized to achieve that victory.
  This factual account of WWII tells it like it was, not some whitewashed version geared to please American and British audiences. The betrayal of Poland throughout that war and after it`s end. Not that the Western Allies had much choice, they did not. The free Polish fought heroically with the Western Allies from 1939 until the end. They comprised 20% of the RAF during the battle of Britain and were the troops that took Monte Casino, not the Americans. Polish units lost more than 3,000 dead in that action alone.
  It also makes note of the fact: That it was the Russian Army that first defeated the Japanese back in 1939 in Manchuria. A fact few historians seem to even be aware of. And that the Russian Army played a crucial role in the surrender of Japan by invading Manchuria in a very large force. The Japanese Army ran for their lives on that front when the Russian Army attacked them. No fight to the death stuff when facing the Russians. They got their butts kicked bigtime in 1939 and 1945 by the Russian Army.
  The same Russian Army that made a practice of raping women in Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and the other Countries they occupied along with murdering so very many others. It really is hard to say who was the worst: Hitler or Stalin.
  These are facts most American and British historians either choose to ignore or are unaware of. I appreciate on honest take on all that happened in WWII. You get that with this series.
  Like I said, NO ONE comes out smelling like a rose in this series.  ...Oscar",1308441600,9,1974,4.605714285714286
3791505,3,B001TKK3KM,"Unfortunately, it is still popular in the West to portray WWII since 1939 and secret deal between Ribbentrop and Molotov. But Stalin's decision to participate in Poland's dissolution was to some extent a reaction to Munich's agreement between UK's Neville Chamberlain, Hitler and Mussolini in 1938. That act authorized Hitler's occupation in Eastern Europe. So, there was not actually only Soviets' guilt in war precondition. Germany actually started that war together with the UK. As usual, BBC tells only part of truth. On the other side, on art, BBC gained a lot having Petrenko in role of J.Stalin. In Russian, his speech sounds very alike to original Stalin's speech and behavior. It is really a play movie, not only a documentary.",1307232000,3,736,5.090909090909091
3791506,5,B001TKK3KM,"The color Reenactments by real actors give this documentary a very different feel and vitality. The series uses declassified Soviet documents to show the intriguing and duplicitous diplomacy of Stalin's Soviet Union. The actors for Stalin, Churchill, Molotov, and Roosevelt are well chosen. As a military history buff I still learned a lot. There is an eerie fascination with the dark dealings of communist Russia for many a student of history.",1304726400,3,444,5.267605633802817
3791507,5,B001TKK3KM,"I've always believed there are 2 sides to a story and sometimes a 3rd.  It's about time this side of the story has been told in a medium.  Thanks to the fall of communism.  The truth found a way out to tell it's side of the story.

Unfortunately propaganda is part of reality.  Growing up in the 80's.  It was always presented to me as the good vs evil.  North America is mostly sheltered from the realities of Europe and the rest of the world.  That's a good thing.  But not all of us wants to stay ignorant.  As a Canadian, I want to know what happens around the world in the past and present.  This is an excellent material for this subject.  It  focuses on the politics and political strategies between the super powers during WW2.  But it also contains info regarding the people and life in Europe during WW2.  The footage and the stories told by the citizens of Europe in this medium is heartbreaking.  But it has to be told.  I just wish there was more coverage on the lives after the war.

On a side note...I waited a year for the price to do down.  It hasn't.  Finally purchased it at $26.  It came in with the sound defect. But Amazon replaced it in 24 hrs.  Great service.",1297296000,5,1183,4.2342342342342345
3791508,4,B001TKK3KM,"I don't see much mentioned in the reviews here that this film incorporates information from Soviet files not available until the 1990s. One important outcome is a new and welcomed delineation of the lying duplicity of Churchill, his involvement in handing half of Europe to Stalin, sentencing the eastern bloc nations to half a century of Stalinist suffering. On the whole, the film presents a view of history distinct from that motorically regurgitated in the West. The dramatised scenes are theatrically believable, and serve as a useful artifice to carry the piece toward that admirable end. Poland's crucifixion is always centerpiece, much of her wartime history well known, division by Germany and Russia etc. but the callous designs of the allied powers in that sacrifice are schooled in this piece with a new cold clarity. An effort worthy on many counts, not least the service of history, and a substantive look at the multiple faces of evil. Recommended for its severe accomplishment.",1296604800,14,993,5.135802469135802
3791509,5,B001TKK3KM,"I started my intense review of WWII in 2009.  I have viewed several hundred DVDs by now.  I spend last weekend looking at this series.  It is everything it says it is.  As a kid growing up in the 50s and 60s I knew virtually nothing about Russia's part in WWII.  With this DVD set you will understand better the start of WWII in Europe.  You will understand the deal that Germany worked out with Russia two weeks before the War began.  You will understand the poor Polish people who were just pawns in German and Russian minds.  You see how ruthless both of these countries were.  I now understand the deep hate these countries had for each other during the war.  We lost almost a half million men in WWII; Russia lost almost 30 million people!!  This DVD set makes me thankful that WWII was never fought on the US continent.  Most of us have no idea how much the peoples of Europe suffered during the war.  This series will make you thankful you live in a democracy instead of a country ruled by dictators.  Although the series was not about American involvement in the war, it opened my eyes to all that happened on the ""Eastern Front"".

3791513,5,B001TKK3KM,This movie made by the Brits outlines the behind the scenes look at World War 2.

Everyone should watch this to really get a good look at the horrors of that war.,1274227200,2,316,4.19672131147541
3791514,3,B001TKK3KM,"I am hesitant to down-rate this to only three stars, because for what it reveals it is quite good.  But it fails to discuss some critical facts, which reveal Stalin to be quite even more horrific than is already developed, and both Roosevelt and Churchill acting very much in understandable ways.  Through those failures, the DVD reveals that either the author Rees or the producers (or both) had a personal or political axe to grind against the Western Allies.  Here's the specifics.

Most centrally important, the entire presentation fails to present with any clarity how Stalin was ruthlessly and systematically slaughtering around 20 million of his own people, both before, during and after the Hitler-Stalin Pact.  It is not an error to say the majority of the Whermacht was ground down by the fierce opposition of Soviet troops, for which the West could be grateful -- one can admire their tenacity and fury of the Russian soldier in that fight.  But one also loses some measure of sympathy for the overall Soviet cause when realizing that once they liberated their own Soviet territory from Nazi hands, the liberated people were typically subjected to ruthless Red Terror, deportation to gulag death-camps, and Inquisitions about how much they were ""contaminated"" by mere contact with the Nazi occupation forces.

Churchill certainly knew some of this, and his tiny nation of England was nearly standing alone against Nazi power.  America became their weapons' supplier, but only entered the war in full measure after Pearl Harbor.  Hitler bungled the first cross-channel invasion, the Battle for Britain, and given time to recover his forces, would have eventually found a way to make a successful cross-channel crossing. England would then also have fallen to Hitlerism.  So the desperation to enlist and keep Stalin in the fight against Hitler was intense.  And it was also fully understandable that, as the fight neared conclusion, the West had to confront the fact that the Soviet Monster was quite capable of continuing its westward invasions.

Roosevelt on the other hand was quite the American socialist, and was surrounded by Soviet sympathizers.  His running mate for the second term, Henry Wallace, was actually a Soviet mole, exposed only by the end of his third term, when he was replaced by Harry Truman.  So Roosevelt was even more ignorant to the nature of Soviet duplicity and slaughter.  He was no hard communist, but did seem to feel he could ""cut a deal"" with Stalin, without full appreciation it was a Dance with the Devil.

Each of these Western elected leaders were trying to protect the interests of their countrymen and of the remaining liberated West European nations.  While it was a terrible that Poland and other East European nations slid under the Stalinist boot-heel, the realistic choices were stark and abysmal.  But to somehow hint or suggest that the blame for that fell upon Churchill or Roosevelt, rather than directly upon Stalin and his henchmen, is outrageous.  Stalin had many millions of Red Army troops, with masses of tanks and aircraft, all battle-hardened and ready for any new battle should the West decide to make a strong point about Polish freedom.  They were not about to give up anything.  The choice was, enter a stale-mate with the Soviets, or continue more bloody war for years to come.  They chose stale-mate, and nearly 50 years of a nuclear-armed stand-off in the Cold War.

This point seemed lost in the DVD, which basically erased Stalin's horrific slaughter of his own people, and the massive size and capability of the Red Army starting in late 1944.  It also gives too much theatrical attention to those things which might make Roosevelt and Churchill seem conniving and duplicitous.  One could find more in their biographies of that period showing great personal courage by both leaders, even if, as imperfect human beings we can pick them apart years later, from the safety of our arm-chairs.

What is excellent, however, is the exposure of lesser-known elements of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, and so if you know something of the historical period, it will be useful for the documentation on that.

3791516,4,B001TKK3KM,"I rarely give anything 5 stars, so 4 stars for me is pretty high rank.
It was a great idea to use actors and make semi-documentary. The production is very good, and the actors did a great job.
I have only one little complain: as a person who speaks both Russian & English very well I notices that most translations from Russian were simplified.
As of the movie itself, it is fairly accurate.
Western audience will learn from the movie that
1) WW II wasn't just about Nazis killed 6 million Jews, and then brave Americans came and save them, as modern American schools teach their students.
2) Soviets lost much much more CIVILIANS than they can imagine, and even a bit more than Jews: 25 millions!
3) D-Day that, as recently Times Magazine declared ""saved the world"" in fact didn't ""save"" much from military point of view because Red Army at that time broke the Nazi's military machine in a few epic battles: Stalingrad, Kursk and Operation Bagration. Red Army in Stalingrad battle killed and captured TEN TIMES more German soldiers than the Western Allies during the entire WW II combined.
Howevere, no doubt it was important that D-Day insured that Western Europe was protected from Stalin's tyranny, and also from military art's point of view it was textbook operation.

I also found some inaccurate or questionable things in the movie.
1) A huge part of the movie is about Poles and Poland and their roles in WW II. With all my respect, it doesn't reflect their real role in WW II. Besides, they suffered a lot in WW II, no doubt,  but other nations suffered no less than Poles and they also deserved to be mentioned there. Examples: terrible famine Dutch suffered in 1945 when Allies armies stayed on their border or Belarusians that lost every fourth civilian during the German occupation.
2) Warsaw uprising was very tragic event and it was not as simple as the movie shows. It actually shows that Stalin must be blamed more than Germans (????) for its tragic end!
The facts are:
a) Red Army was too far away from Warsaw and simply could not take it and help fighting people there.
b) The uprising was inspired by the Polish Government in exile to ensure they will rule Warsaw. Those guys that lived in comfort in London sacrificed tens of thousands lives of fellow Poles to reach their political interests. The uprising was poorly prepared and was doomed at the beginning.
c) They started the uprising ONLY because Red Army was approaching swiftly.  They thought that they would take control on Warsaw, and then they would hold it until Red Army comes to help them! As you can see, even though Red Army was so ""terrible"", they counted on its help!
3) The movie shows Poles didn't get anything good from Soviets. To be objective, the authors should have mentioned (at least) that Soviets rescued Krakow, the ancient beautiful Polish city, from complete destruction by Nazis.
4) The movie claims that Stalin hated Poles because he wanted to invade Poland in 1920, but failed.
Firstly, Stalin hated everybody, and he killed much more fellow Soviet people than any others. So, he didn't hate Poles more than other nations.
Secondly, the truth is it was Poland that attacked Russia and Ukraine in 1920 (read Wikipedia's article Polish-Soviet War) when they were in ruins after WW I and devastating civil war to take control of territories that were part of Russian Empire. And the Poles were as brutal to Ukrainian civilians as Nazis (as they always been in the past!) when they briefly occupied Ukraine: rapes and terrible tortures were common, according to documents from that war.
As you can see, Poles tried to do exactly the same things for Russians and Ukrainians as Stalin did to them 20 years later! The difference is the failed.
But here we have usual simplified propaganda's black and white pictures: ""good and pieceful"" Poles and ""bad"" Russians, just like ""good"" Albanians and ""bad"" Serbs or ""good"" Georgians and ""bad"" Russians, etc.
Anyway, overall this is a good, objective and honest movie, although it is not free from some anti-Russian propaganda.",1254441600,8,4066,4.780938833570413

3791518,2,B001TKK3KM,"This documentary didn't bring really any new fact about Joseph Stalin rule over SSSR, on the period 1939-1948.

Stalin is portrayed as a malefic evildoer, a scheming  tyrant  per si and no historical background of his struggle to ascent to the power is shown,  and no light on the internal fights in the SSSR communist's party central bureau is presented; this documentary simply state the Stalin is an evil man and all his political victims are innocents.
If you want understand better the man and his times, I recommend Simon Sebag-Montefiore books ""Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar"" and ""Young Stalin"".

Stalin was ruthless, but at times very pragmatic and he was politician with a world view and historical perspective on the relationship of Russia with the other states like Ukraine, Poland and so on; Nothing on his politic towards this countries differs from the Czar Peter the Great, or Ivan IV the Terrible, equally bold and ruthless rulers, have done in the past.

Stalin wasn't a saint, but I was expecting a better job from BBC offering a so called ""Behind the Door"" look at so pivotal personality of XX century's history.",1249948800,7,1135,4.824742268041237

3791520,4,B001TKK3KM,"This fascinating dramatic documentary examines the personal relationships and secret meetings that shaped the course and outcome of World War II. While new revelations are few and hardly earth-shattering, the manner of presentation -'mixing archived films and interviews with dramatic interpretations of summit meetings and key events -'makes this an entertaining, engaging series.

Extremely compelling is the use of native actors (instead of Americans or Brits mangling foreign languages), led by the distinguished Russian actor Alexei Petrenko (who, over a 40-year career has played everyone from Svidrigailov to Peter I to Rasputin) in the role of Stalin (pictured above). The dramatic renditions are all the more fascinating when heard in the original language, as in Churchill's exchange with Stalin:

Churchill:' What did you do with all the kulaks?
Stalin:''' ''My ikh perebili''''''''. (We terminated them.)

As with any serialized documentary Behind Closed Doors often suffers from repetition of scripts and imagery across episodes, but this is overshadowed by the well-drawn characterizations, be it Stalin's Georgian-accented Russian, Ribbentrop's contemptuous gaze, Churchill's inane analogies, or Roosevelt's yearning to be liked.

Many ""new"" facts were unearthed when the Russians opened their archives after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992.  Two quick examples:  (1) Stalin, in fact, signed an order in March of 1940 authorizing the murder of almost 22,000 Polish officers, including the massacre of almost 5,000 in the Katyn Forest -- a fact FDR not only denied, but also intentionally suppressed;  (2) In accordance with the infamous Ribbentrop/Molotov pact of August of 1939, the Soviets also invaded and occupied eastern Poland when the Nazis invaded Poland from the west in September of that year and not one iota of attention was paid to this by anyone in the free world.
