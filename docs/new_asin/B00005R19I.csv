1653145,5,B00005R19I,"Tongue-in-cheek I must say that I loved to watch how cheesy this movie ended up being.  I thought I was going to watch a scary flick about how piranha's eat people, but instead got a dose of 70's adventure that attempted to use a combination of cliche and action to it's advantage....with hilarious results.  Not what I expected, but I had a great time making fun of it!!",1192665600,4,371,4.4411764705882355
1653146,1,B00005R19I,Don't mistake this disk for the cool Roger Corman movie of the same title.  This movie is so bad that I would have given it a 0 out of 5 stars it that option was available.  Only order this if you have a perverse love of horrifically bad seventies adventure movies.,1009929600,2,265,4.176470588235294
7951733,4,B00005R19I,"Released in 1972, Piranha chronicles events when a brother & sister photography team (Tom Simcox & Ahna Capri) enlist a guide (Peter Brown) for a tour in the jungle wilderness where they meet a friendly-but-mysterious hunter named Caribe (William Smith), who lives in the jungle. Caribe shows his true colors when he acts upon his Native namesake.

People badmouth this movie because they fell prey to a bait-and-switch by DVD-makers or whomever. This is NOT the Roger Corman nature-runs-amok flick of the same name from 1978. Neither is it a creature feature at all. It's a realistic Venezuelan jungle adventure/thriller with hints of horror highlighted by genuine early 70's atmosphere. Despite being an adventure/thriller, the title Piranha does not misrepresent the movie, which is explained in the second half and ties into the plot (Im not going to give it away). Another thing to keep in mind is that the movie was released in '72, three years before ""Jaws"" made nature-runs-amok flicks popular. So the filmmakers didn't title it ""Piranha"" with the intention of misleading fans of creatures-on-the-loose flicks.

In any case, the cast is great, although they coulda done better with someone other than Capri in the female role, even though she plays the part well despite my slight misgivings. Simcox is a likable masculine protagonist and its too bad he didn't become a star, although he had constant TV work. Brown is good too, but its Smith who towers here, literally at 62, but in overweening taciturn charisma as well. Caribe seems like a cool guy to party with in the jungle and the quartet have some good times together, including a long (8.5 minute) motorcycle race, but the story takes a dark turn in the final act. Ive seen a handful of Smith films & TV episodes over the years and this is by far his best role.

Some complain about the stock footage of numerous animals, but it adds to the jungle atmospherics. Others complain about the thinness of the plot and the seeming padding with the animal, Native and diamond-panning footage, etc. This has have caused some to criticize the movie as a Venezuelan travelogue, but I enjoyed this aspect. Viewing the film IS like vacationing in Venezuela and I found it interesting and informative, but its just a stage for the interesting low-key drama of the quartet. And, say what you will about the thin story, but it gels together into a meaningful whole with interesting things to glean.

If you're in the mood for a 60s-70s psychological adventure/thriller I recommend Piranha. However, if you need an explosion every second and unrealistic action sequences to maintain your attention look elsewhere.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot entirely in Venezuela.

7951734,3,B00005R19I,"This edition is from PDC Home Ent. and has typically average audio/video for a low-budget release.  No serious issues, but it is presented in full frame.  There is no problem with splicing, but at 89 min. it's hard to tell if anything is missing because it has been listed as being a little longer.",1453507200,,298,4.5
7951735,5,B00005R19I,very good video if you want to learn about piranhas !,1453075200,,53,3.909090909090909

7951737,2,B00005R19I,My father Tom Simcox is in this movie and he is great. He literally saved Bill's life in it during filming but this movie is pretty bad. It seemed better when I was a kid. There was a piranha scene where a deer or something runs through the water and gets eaten alive but not something I would want to see again anyways. Pretty sure there were more deleted scenes.,1432684800,,364,4.214285714285714
7951738,1,B00005R19I,this movie sucked. i watched 10mins hated it and then sold it to get some of my money back. i would not recommend this movie.,1360886400,,125,4.04
7951739,1,B00005R19I,"I bought this movie thinking it was the cult classic Piranha.  After I realized it wasn't, I figured I'd watch it anyway since I am a fan old movies.  It sucked. Bad acting and the camera work was horrifing. Dont buy this unless you know for sure what you are getting.  Ill not make that mistake twice.",1330387200,,302,4.2631578947368425
7951740,1,B00005R19I,"**Plot Spoiler review** (If possible)
The movie shows you a close-up of a piranha that is out of water with ominous music. A lone piranha, out of water, is not very scary. Some Americans go to Venezuela for a camera safari in the jungle. From the way they are talking I expected to see dinosaurs, but from the title...piranha (and we see neither). Ahna Capri, the female babe on the trip is against guns (Warning a pro-gun film slapping in the face of liberals.). While in the jungle she gets raped (both are fully clothed) and changes her mind...movie over. There are some filler scenery scenes, some of which where noticeably shot with a different camera in another location. No bad language, no sex, no nudity, and no piranha. You're better off with an Asylum film you have already seen and hated. Okay, so I spoiled the plot for you and SAVED YOU 90 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE.

You're Welcome.",1322697600,,892,4.575
7951741,1,B00005R19I,"The advertisement stated this is a 2005 movie. When I received it, it was a 73' movie only remastered in 2005. This movie is awful. Saw only 2 minutes of it and turned it off. Now I'm trying to get rid of it. What a waste. It doesn't even deserve a rating.",1290556800,,256,3.9423076923076925
7951742,3,B00005R19I,"This movie would be much better if it had been digitally enhanced.  It looks about as bad as an old tape. Even some of the sound is hard to make out.  Except for this, I liked the movie.  I am a willaim Smith/Peter Brown fan and they're both in it, but it would have been nice to see it better.  There is a good motorcycle race and lots of outdoor footage.",1240876800,3,356,3.971830985915493
