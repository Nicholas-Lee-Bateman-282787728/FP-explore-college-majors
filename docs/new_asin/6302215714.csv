436271,5,6302215714,"I highly recommend this DVD. Short, concise rants on a wide variety of topics will keep you chuckling non-stop!",1278806400,,111,4.894736842105263
436272,2,6302215714,"This is an Asian import of ""Kid From Brooklyn"", quality is mediocre at best. Taken directly from a old film or VHS of a film; the color is faded, the faces are out of focus, and you can see film imperfections, burn spots, etc, as well as areas of camera shake, on the Disc. Great Danny Kaye movie, buy this if it is all you can get, and just have to have it. At least, till it is shown on TV, or a U.S. studio releases it.",1268784000,,422,3.8620689655172415
436273,4,6302215714,"I like some skit's,the majority are quite funny...the dvd could have been done better and the sound isn't always there,not clear enough",1251072000,,135,5.181818181818182
436274,5,6302215714,"A remake of a 1936 Harold Lloyd talkie, ""The Kid From Brooklyn"" is bright-eyed fun, a typically color-splashed, music-filled MGM vehicle for Danny Kaye's antics. The lovely Virginia Mayo returns as Kaye's love interest as his wide-eyed milkman character gets touted for boxing glory after he accidentally knocks out the current champ. There are some lively physical bits here, peppered with some snappy dialogue exchanges. The one flaw in the story is when Kaye's character performs a complicated, rapid-fire musical routine--which is perfect for Kaye himself--but goes completely against his screen character. It's just another example of MGM using any excuse to do a musical number & sacrificing character continuity.
Otherwise, TKFB is top-notch Kaye fun, with a great supporting cast.",1250380800,,788,5.520661157024794
436275,4,6302215714,"I purchased the video for one reason--to see one of Steve Cochran's early appearances in film. I planned to ff thru most of the scenes, but what a treat--I really liked it. I had forgotten what a great physical comic timing Danny Kaye had. Steve was a big surprise too--usually the bad guy, tough cop or misfit, he was really funny in the role of the boxer who kept being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Virginia Mayo was lovely as always--Vera Ellen a dynamo dancer, Danny Kaye at his best and Steve going with the flow. All in all, a funny movie with beautiful people, sadly, all no longer with us.  Chris",1238371200,,613,4.3304347826086955

436278,4,6302215714,"This is a hilarious piece of a man speaking for the people.  ""The Big Man"" gets it done in a laugh out loud DVD.  Keep the kids away from Mike because he will shock and awe with his language but he will make you think twice about life in the year 2007!",1194566400,,252,3.826923076923077

436281,4,6302215714,"One of Danny Kaye's lesser known films, but on a par with classics like Walter Mitty and Court Jester. Kaye is at his best playing the unwitting pawn who always comes out on top. A definite ""must-have"" for any fan of Danny Kaye's work. Now how about a DVD version?",974332800,,264,4.3

7822366,5,6302215714,"Brings back many memories of Danny Kaye. A good storyline filled with jokes, antics and songs from Mr. Kaye. The transition from flunkee salesmnan to prize fighter to partner in his starting company is a great ending. Of course the supporting actors.actresses help complete the movie",1394841600,,283,5.173913043478261

7822370,4,6302215714,"This was almost a 100% remake of Harold Lloyd's The Milky Way years earlier.  Danny Kaye, as usual, made it even funnier as a most untough lad becoming of supposed champion caliber in the boxing ring due to fights fixed in his favor,  It's well worth watching for laughs.",1326758400,,271,4.510204081632653
