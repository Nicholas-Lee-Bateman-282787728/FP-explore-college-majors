8195118,4,B000Q7ZO9O,"The main feature of the DVD is a chronological overview of Tsukamoto's filmography; but, most importantly, it features an extensive interview/commentary from Shinya Tsukamoto. It is excellent insight into how he grew as both a director (for film and stage) and actor, from his early days of filmmaking through ""A Snake of June."" The bonus features are great as well, but the essay by Lawrence stands out as my favorite.

My single ding on this DVD is that the interview is interspersed with film footage; and, everything but the film footage is captioned in English. This isn't much of an issue for people who've seen these movies. But, I found myself wishing it was there because of how frequently film footage was shown. It felt like a good quarter of the material was lacking subtitles; and, at under an hour long, that's a good chunk of missing dialogue for context's sake.

Overall, a must-see for anyone interested in this director or of speculative fiction in Japanese film. Just know you'll be missing something if you aren't previously familiar with Tsukamoto's work.",1509148800,,1076,4.939226519337017
8195119,4,B000Q7ZO9O,"Basic Tsukamoto is essential, almost scholarly in its analysis and interview of what could be one of Japan's most influential, revolutionary vanguards in avant garde cinema, maybe in the whole world as well (next to the likes of David Lynch, David Cronenberg--both of which are highly compared to Tsukamoto, and even someone like Jan Svankmeyer.) As the sort of founding father/pioneer that would spearhead the cinematic likes of Takashi Miike and Ryuhei Kitamura, and the more obscure likes of Shozin Fukui). Study hard with this documentary; there's a pop quiz after this! ;-)",1347753600,,578,5.225806451612903
8195120,5,B000Q7ZO9O,I have been a Tsukamoto fan for a bit and wasn't sure if I would learn anything from this dvd that I haven't already seen or heard before. I was happy to see footage from Tsukamotos' starting out films that I never saw before. There was film of his plays that he was in and shots of movies that he acted in. I was happy with the dvd and the information. It goes up A Snake of June.,1330128000,,381,3.8974358974358974
