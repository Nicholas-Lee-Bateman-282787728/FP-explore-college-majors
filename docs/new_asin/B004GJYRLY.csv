4373320,4,B004GJYRLY,"Very expensive, but worth it to get the Shadows of the Tower series. A low-budget but earnestly made multi-part series about the rise of Henry VII (and the Tudor dynasty). It was created in the 1970s and is very difficult to find these days. The acting is good and the costumes and military kit all seem accurate enough for edutainment purposes. The other two collections are available on Netflix and in other places, but it's still nice to have the whole set of disks all in once place.",1390089600,11,487,4.545454545454546
4373321,5,B004GJYRLY,"This was a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves the DVD series and calls me to tell me all about Henry the VIII (insert eye roll here - smile). She loves British history. She was a high school English teacher (retired now) and is a huge fan of English literature.  She was over the moon with joy when she opened her gift. Now, I am daughter of the year.",1389398400,4,353,4.042857142857143

4373323,4,B004GJYRLY,I had seen The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R. years ago on PBS and it was a pleasure to see them again. The historical merits are much greater than in more recent works. The Shadow of the Tower was a nice bonus.,1375488000,5,221,3.933333333333333
4373324,5,B004GJYRLY,"Am receiving great pleasure with the Tudor Collection. Had never viewed In The Shadow of The Tower, which explained the background history of HenryVIII and Elizabeth I.Both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I brought back wonderfull memories of first viewings. The entire collection was magnificant, acting was exceptional,staging and sceney lovely, and each episode a pleasure to watch over and over.

Great quality DVDs. Oh, and the BBC version of Phillipa Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl is also included!!",1345075200,25,270,4.313725490196078
4373327,5,B004GJYRLY,"Even if The Shadow of the Towers fails to find a compelling lead performance to anchor its fascinating storyline...the landmark miniseries The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R more than make up for that disappointment. Anyone interested in vintage British television, English history, or the miniseries genre must own The BBC Tudors Collection for their libraries. It's British television at its finest. With the wealth of extras included, I'm awarding The BBC Tudors Collection 5 stars.",1321142400,24,494,5.346153846153846

4373332,5,B004GJYRLY,"I have always wanted a copy of both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I BBC Production.  Having seen both programs when they first came out on TV, I was happy to be able to obtain both copies.  To my surprise Henry VII - In The Shadow of the Tower was an addition and James Maxwell's portrayal of Henry VII was excellent and, as always, the cast was perfect!  I had never seen this production and am very happy to now have this collection of the Tudors.  I have watched them more than once and so many of the actors have gone on to great success in movies and TV work.
The Special Features are a must see....",1501113600,,599,4.137931034482759
4373333,4,B004GJYRLY,Loved this series. Only docked a star because on of the cases was broken when I received it.,1500249600,,92,4.166666666666667
4373334,2,B004GJYRLY,I was disappointed.  Wish I had only bought the 6 wives. it was interesting and well done as I had seen it in the 70s. The other two brought the rating down.,1497571200,,157,3.90625
4373335,4,B004GJYRLY,"This DVD set has three TV series from BBC. The six wives of Henry VIII is the best. It tells the story of all six wives and more.  If you like stories from that time, you may like these series. It does move slow like a play, but it is still fun to watch. The clothes are pretty and the acting is good.",1497484800,,301,3.7777777777777777
4373336,5,B004GJYRLY,"Three of the best historical mini-series ever, together in one set. Each presented in an episodic style of the key events of the Tudor monarchs. All place an emphasis on history and storytelling over big budget production values, but are witty and intelligently written. The Shadow Of The Tower is the rarely told story of the outrageous reign of Henry VII. James Maxwell's sly (nearly hammy) performance showcases Henry Tudor's political shrewdness and paranoia in a court filled with spies and plots. The Six Wives Of Henry VIII has each unique episode concentrate on a single wife and their individual personalities. Keith Mitchell is a perfect Henry VIII - jovial but cruel, and larger than life. As a plus you get a BBC production of The Other Boleyn Girl as a bonus feature. Finally, Elizabeth R. is the ultimate drama of the legendary life of Queen Elizabeth I. Glenda Jackson completely and ideally captures Elizabeth's regal personality and complicated relationships. All these mini-series are brilliant examples of BBC history dramas from the 1970's, they're both poignant and intellectual, but most importantly - completely entertaining. If you enjoyed Wolf Hall or I,Claudius or just Tudor history you won't be disappointed by this great set.",1497139200,,1254,5.182266009852217

4373353,5,B004GJYRLY,"This is an excellent series that focuses on story and history. While the budget and scope doesn't compare to many modern shows, it still strives for authentic costuming and design and largely succeeds. Well acted and scripted, this does a great job of hitting critical points of 120 years of English monarchy.

I will warn though, it isn't very romanticized and shows some unpleasantness of both humanity and history. While I wouldn't call it graphic, it covers a period of history full of lies, politics, torture and executions. This is done in service of the story and in it's attempt to show the unpleasantness of the times.

Bonus: There is a lot of surviving information from this time period and one can easily find portraits and other information of the major characters online. Credit to the BBC for how well they got actors to look like the portraits.",1461542400,,860,4.804054054054054
4373354,5,B004GJYRLY,I have loved this PBS series ever since it aired. Keith Mitchell portrayed Henry the 8th superbly! ( And closely resembled Henry) The actresses who played each wife did their parts beautifully as well as all the supporting cast. Worth every penny. I never tire of watching this series. If you love the Tudor era this is something you will want to watch.,1457481600,,353,4.619047619047619
4373355,5,B004GJYRLY,I watched these when they were originally broadcasted & enjoyed being able to watch them again in the chronology of the period; starting with the rise of Henry VII through to Elizabeth I.

My favorite is ""The Shadow of the Tower"" (1972) with the great James Maxwell as Henry VII.

Only this part's booklet (with the story how ""Shadow"" was filmed and the cast's bio) was included.

There were no such booklets for Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.",1431734400,2,333,4.610169491525424

8428767,3,B004GJYRLY,"I was hoping for a more documentary-style look at the Tudors but alas, they're all older dramas.

8428769,3,B004GJYRLY,"The advertisement states English subtitles, well, except ""The Shadow of the tower"", there are NO subtitles. The transfers are not of high quality. They look like VHS cassettes. All the boxes arrived completely broken. Being multi-discs boxes, they cannot be replaced.
As for the content itself, these are series I have seen in my youth. I liked them then, I still like them now. Putting aside the historic facts, the important thing here is the dramatization and acting. Glenda Jackson as a young cheerful and bubbling Bess, cunning and intelligent -  turning to a sour but responsible / irresponsible Great  Elizabeth R the First. . Keith Michell is turning also from young and nice to the obese and sick monster he became in later years, driven by his obsession to have a son / sons as heir / heirs. The shadow of the tower, gives us a glimpse into the grim English medieval history. The ""let down"" is the cheap studio quality of the interiors. The royal palaces and lodges are very poorly furnished. But, let's take the series as filmed theater and then it fits the decor.",1519257600,,1075,4.712765957446808

They are a magnificent artistic achievement; the acting is superb and the scripts are intelligent and for the most part historically accurate.  My only complaint is that they have no subtitles, only Closed Captions, which are not very satisfactory.  For one thing, if you have a modern Blu-ray player connected to the TV by HDMI, as is usually the case,  Closed Captions are lost.
Amazon claims, in the description of this set, that it has subtitles. but I don't believe it.  Would someone who has bought it please tell us if there are English subtitles, or are there only Closed Captions?  Amazon is often careless about that.",1504915200,,723,4.698412698412699
