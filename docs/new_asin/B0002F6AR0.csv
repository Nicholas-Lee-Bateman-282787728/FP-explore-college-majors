The interviews are insightful and interesting. There are a couple of unfamily appropriate moments involving the import models doing some dancing, but would still be pg13 fare. Very nice interview with Sasha Singleton that makes her appear meaner than she probably is. Only downside would be the last 15 minutes ending with the focus on the guy with the Cavalier. Doesn't have much racing action or car show scenes outside of what seems be the same Hot Import Nights show, but tells a great story.",1115510400,,638,4.705357142857143
8027707,5,B0002F6AR0,"This has got to be the best dvd i have seen regarding the import tuning world out there. And i have seen my share of dvd,s regarding this subject as i have been into the whole import scene for over 4 years now. Alot of dvds out there are nothing more than fluff pieces,never really dwelling inside the import scene like R Generation does. This dvd goes into how the import scene got started,what makes it tick,and what makes us tuners spend the insane amout of money we sink into our cars. I thought i spent alot,some of the guys in this dvd are insane,sometimes spending upward to 30,000 dollars into some of these cars. Alot of these guys are regular joes like you and me who have such a passion for this hobby that they spend more time with they're cars than they're own families. Its really interesting to hear them talk about what drives them to modify they're car to the extent that they do. R Generation also has interviews with some of the icons of the import world like RJ de Vera and such. And also interviews with some of the import models who make a living modeling at some shows such as Hot import night,import showoff,etc. It also looks at the car clubs who are like families that take part in this sport. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is into the import scene. R generation is the best look into the tuner world to come out in a long time.",1111363200,3,1366,4.319066147859922
