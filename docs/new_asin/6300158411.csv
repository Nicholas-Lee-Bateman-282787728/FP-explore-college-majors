210382,5,6300158411,"We've all seen this cult horror classic many times (""They're coming to get you Barbara!"").  You should treat yourself and watch it one more time from this restored print.  I first saw this film as a first run movie at a drive-in theater in 1968 and this print is better than that.  The technology used in restoring these old movies produces a truly amazing result.  Some in fact may think it is TOO clean, taking away from the 'campiness' of the film.

Highly recommended for the restoration alone.",1393977600,5,498,4.613636363636363
210383,4,6300158411,I'm not sure what is added to this movie from the original but a classic flick is still a classic.,1389225600,,98,3.95
210384,5,6300158411,"The original, and still the best.  Just a digital remake of it, nice and handy for us kindle owners to keep in the cloud.  It's a normal day and you're visiting your fathers grave when suddenly, people start behaving oddly.  Next thing you know, your brothers dead and you can't find the keys to your car.  After a narrow escape you find a house in the middle of no where, and the people inside are all dead, or trying to eat you.  Don't worry, I'm sure you'll make it out okay in the end.....

This is the only scarey moive I still can't watch alone in the dark after 35 years.  It's subtle theme of constant, ever worsening, fear is less about zombies and more about the breakdown of civility in the face of doom.  There's a reason this gets remastered and redigitized over and over, it's the greatest horror film of all times!",1363392000,21,829,4.337662337662338
210385,3,6300158411,I watched this movie in college expecting to see one of those old cheesy horror movies and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  The sociological undertones in the movie really relate and show the struggles of race and equality during the time period.  A group of strangers isolated in a house trying to survived the epidemic that is outside their door not realizing that zombies aren't the only thing they need to fear. It's not long and it's really engrossing.  Shooting it in black and white somehow even adds to the nostalgia of the film.,1243641600,5,544,4.705263157894737
210386,5,6300158411,"What makes this movie work so well is that it relies on real scarry creatures, eerie direction and great use of black and white film while later versions relied on gory special effect body mutilations.
The movie starts right out with a funeral in a grave yard.  A man and his sister are visiting their mother's grave and the woman is quite unnerved about being in the graveyard.  The man starts to play on her uneasiness saying things like ""Barbara, they're coming to get you Barbara.""  Suddenly up walks a kind of frightening man and her brother than says ""here comes one of them now.""  We the audience still think nothing of it and the brother is still laughing and taunting his sister, when the strange man gets real close and then just starts attacking the brother.  We experience real horror as we realize that it is not really a scarry looking man but a kind of zombie.  After quickly dispatching her brother, the zombie starts to chase the already shaken Barbara.
What follows is a very tense, well directed chase.  Barbara somehow gets away from the man/zombie and makes it to a house.  In the house she meets a few people that have taken refuge from the apparent army of zombies that are now walking around the area trying to kill anyone they see.
We then meet the real star of the movie, a black man who serves as the ""sane"" leader of the refugees giving them direction on how to fortify the house against the attacking zombies.
What follows are many tense moments inside the house as the people argue about what they need to do to surivive.
Don't watch this movie at home alone!",1069804800,2,1589,4.512195121951219
210387,5,6300158411,"though its in black and white and has some wooden actors and funky diolauge, this movie will leave you chilled to the bone with some hungry monsters. this one has a woman and her brother going to the cemetary, a zombie kills her brother, she runs her ass off to a abandoned house and then she meets a black man(Duane Jones), bare with me folks I do not know there names, I forget. Zombies enclose the house and the 2 border up the windows and doors. then other folks from the basement come up and they have a sick girl down below. 2 other women and men. a girlfriend and a boyfriend get blown up in a car and the zombies eat the burnt flesh. the other man is shot to death and the mother of the sick girl gets stabbed in the chest by the girl with a spade and that scene is terrifying if you think of it. the girl from the beginning gets eaten alive by her zombie brother and the black guy(Duane Jones) gets shot in the end because the cops think hes a zombie. this movie leaves you with a cold chill running all threw your body",1066262400,2,1028,4.094059405940594

210708,5,6300158411,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is everything a horror movie should be. Black & White with classic horror movie muic. Bleak with a terrifying concept, and completely devoid of humor. The movie is extremely well acted, especially considering the budget they had to work with. This leads to a very believable film. Romero and Russo came up believed they came up with the most terrifying idea (the dead eating the living), and they were right. The antagonists aren't made up creations like vampires or aliens. They're us. Every aspect adds up to the quintessential horror story.

One thing I would like to point out in particular is the AMAZING guerrilla-style camera work. Up to 1968, I don't recall ever seeing a film that made use of the camera angles in a way that truly conveyed a manic state throughout. This honestly was one of the most influential horror films ever made. Night of the Living Dead was the basis of five subsequent Living Dead films (19782010) also directed by Romero, and has inspired remakes.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengoolie is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better :Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner) drive to rural Pennsylvania for an annual visit to their father's grave, at their mother's request. Noticing Barbra's discomfort, Johnny teases, ""They're coming to get you, Barbra"", before she is attacked by a strange man (Bill Hinzman). Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but breaks his neck on a gravestone, killing himself. Barbra flees by car but crashes into a tree. With the stranger in pursuit, she escapes on foot, and later arrives at a farmhouse where she discovers a woman's mangled corpse. Running out of the house, she is confronted by strange menacing figures like the man in the graveyard. Ben (Duane Jones) takes her into the house, where Barbra slowly descends into shock and insanity as Ben drives the monsters from the house and seals the doors and windows.

Ben and Barbra are unaware that the farmhouse has a cellar, housing an angry married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), who sought refuge after a group of zombies overturned their car; and teenage couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), who arrived after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal murders. Karen has fallen seriously ill after being bitten by one of the zombies. They venture upstairs when Ben turns on a radio, while Barbra awakens from a stupor. Harry demands that everyone hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a ""deathtrap"" and continues, upstairs, to barricade the house, with Tom's help.

Radio reports explain that a state of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern United States. When Ben finds a television, the emergency broadcaster reports that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming the flesh of the living. Experts, scientists, and the United States military fail to discover the cause, though one scientist suspects radioactive contamination from a space probe returning from Venus, which was deliberately exploded in the Earth's atmosphere when the radiation was detected.

 The Cooper family hiding in the cellar.
When the reports list local rescue centers offering refuge and safety, Ben plans to obtain medical care for Karen. Ben and Tom therefore refuel Ben's truck, while Harry hurls Molotov cocktails from an upper window at the ""undead"". Fearing for Tom's safety, Judy follows him. At the pump, Tom accidentally spills gasoline on the truck, setting it ablaze. Tom and Judy try to drive the truck away from the pump, but Judy is unable to free herself from its door, and the truck explodes, instantly killing Tom and Judy.

Ben returns to the house, but is locked out by Harry, and forces entry. Angered by Harry's cowardice, Ben beats him, while the undead feed on the remains of Tom and Judy. In the house, a news report reveals that, aside from setting the ""reactivated bodies"" on fire, only a gunshot or heavy blow to the head can stop them, and that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.

Moments later, the lights go out and the living dead break through the barricades. Harry grabs Ben's rifle and threatens to shoot him, but Ben wrestles the gun away and fires. Mortally wounded, Harry stumbles into the cellar and collapses next to Karen, who has also died from her illness. The undead try to pull Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself and goes down into the cellar, to find a reanimated Karen eating Harry. Helen, paralyzed by shock, falls as Karen stabs her to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the living dead, is carried away by the horde and devoured. The undead overrun the house, and Ben seals himself inside the cellar (ironically, the course of action he originally argued against), where he finds Harry and Helen starting to reanimate and shoots them.

The next morning, Ben is awakened by the gunshots of sheriff's deputies killing all the zombies they find. Venturing upstairs, he is killed by a member of the posse. The film ends with a series of still shots as Ben is placed onto a burning pyre, along with other dead bodies.",1431820800,5,5584,4.8870116156283

I own two DVD's of the 1968 version, and each one starts out with Barbara and Johnny in the car on the way to the graveyard.

My 3 cousins (16, 15 and 12 yrs. old) and I made a pact that we were all going to stay up and watch this after SNL, on ""Chiller"" (Yes, the six fingered hand)
We were all bright eyed through SNL, and then it ended. We made the popcorn, and settled in. 15 minutes in, 16 went to bed, 30 minutes in, 15 went to bed, and 12, my counter part, fell asleep. I was alone!!!! abandoned by those whom I loved.  I steeled myself, and stared at the screen, unable to look away, I was terrified, but I got through it. What I did not count on, was the nightmares that plagued me for the next two years. Yes, full on, in my face, zombies, trying to eat me. It got to the point where, as much as would deny it, I made sure I got home before it got dark. And if not, I ran, covertly. I suffered this trauma alone.

For an older movie these zombie will creep you out. The way they move, look and attack. I absolutely love the news coverage detailing what caused the reanimated bodies.

7803325,5,6300158411,"Once Upon a Time in...Halloween 1994. I was watching George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead(1968) for the first time on TV(on a program called 'Best Picture Show').  I had nightmares about zombies crawling out of the dirt a la Michael Jackson's Thriller. The TV station censored what they had to. The TV commercials gave you a chance to take a breather before going back into the dark, violent, gloomy atmosphere of the film. Seven people hide in a Pennsylvania farmhouse from zombies and discover that the real enemy they're fighting is each other. The film borrows ideas from Richard Matheson's I am Legend, Lord of the Flies and Carnival of Souls. It was made on a very low budget of $114, 000. There was a lot of social and political upheaval in the U.S.A. when the film was made. The MPAA rating system was created around the time this movie was released. There's blood and gore in Night of the Living Dead, but it's tame compared to the sequels and rip offs where the blood and guts are raised up to the nth degree. There's a Rifftrax version of NOTLD. Bill Corbett cracks a joke about outdated UHF TV signals. He also claims that the surname ""Cooper"" sounds like something from The Wonder Years TV show. NOTLD has some creepy music cues borrowed from a music library. The grainy black and white filmstock gives the film a documentary-like feel. The copyright expired on NOTLD; there are a lot of gray market copies on VHS and DVD. NOTLD is a seminal horror film. Check it out.",1520208000,,1488,4.573033707865169

""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" starts this movie. They drive to a cemetery to visit their Mother's grave. An old man walks toward them, then another man attacks Barbara, who defends herself. Strange men try to get in her car! She runs away screaming. She sees a farmhouse and runs toward it. Its front door is locked, nobody at home. Stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. Something falls from the second floor! A pickup truck arrives with a man wearing a suit. Any shotguns or rifles inside? The man pushes a zombie out the door. Barbara uses a steel rod against another zombie. [Is there an explanation for these anomalies? If its not nuclear tests then it could be Global Warming!] Can the zombies be stopped? Can you kill the dead? They must stay in the farmhouse until help arrives. [No telephone service?]

Night falls. They have electricity. The radio has ""trash talk"", people who talk as if they know something when they don't. Ben and Barbara take out the trash, then talk about what happened. Only a shot to the head will stop them. Ben finds ammunition, there must be guns in the house. Ben finds one (the previous owner has no need for it). They find other refugees in the house. The truck is out of gas, is there gas kept in the shed? Should they hide in the cellar? Ben says no. They learn what happened earlier. There are personal conflicts. Ben orders boards nailed over the glass windows for protection. Barbara sees more zombies approaching the house. The activities provide shocking surprises! The television tells of an emergency. Will Cooper cooperate? Can they work together? A zombie tries to break in, but is stopped. Barbara shows her marksmanship skills! She gets more bullets. Cooper hears the TV broadcast news.

What is causing people to act like that? What if the recently dead should come back to life? Is it a widespread virus? Judgment Day? There is more personal conflict inside. Can they find the truck keys? Yes, but they need gas for the truck. More zombies gather around the house, a flaming torch keeps them away. The gas pump explodes and the truck burns. No escape now. Ben fights his way back. Cooper fights with Barbara for the rifle! What happened to Sarah? Can Barbara get help? Zombies break on through to the inside! Is there no escape? What will happen when they run out of bullets? The morning brings help, armed men and a helicopter. The zombies are disposed of, then place on a huge pile. They find one in the cellar. Barbara gets the last one! She watches the burning pyre. What is she thinking now?

The original 1968 monochrome movie was a low budget production from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania that was a surprise hit in the spring of that year. It resonated with the audience somehow. This is a copy that has some changes from the original story. Was it better? The original was more restrained, perhaps due to the censorship of that era. The story didn't offer an explanation for its impossible premise. What happened in the other parts of the country, such as urban areas? Will they ever offer a third version? Not if there is no paying audience. Does this uprising symbolize the threat from the huge debts of the past? They can't be ended with a well-aimed rifle shot. You may like this movie more if you never saw the original, which was also average.",1482278400,,3349,4.642495784148398
