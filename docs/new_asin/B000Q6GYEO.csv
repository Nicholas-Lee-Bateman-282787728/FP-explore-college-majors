After the various glowing critic's reviews of this game I read online I have to say I was sorely disappointed within the first 3 minutes of game play... hentai films are, basically, erotic anime with strong sexual content.  Basically I was expecting this to be a hentai movie with a ""choose your own adventure/plotline"" element thrown in - you'd be shown part of a movie, the movie would stop at a certain point while you made a decision for the character which would lead you to another part of the movie, and so forth...basically an interactive plotline where you could be shown any one of several video clips depending on your choices.

The key word here is ""movie"" and given the amount of content (four gigabytes for a single layer, 8 gigabytes for a double layer) that can be held on, say a DVD, for example I'm sure the technology exists that would make this possible... instead in X-Change 2 we're given a variety of several single, still (non moving) pictures while the characters read out loud what's happening to you... Basically it's like having a story being read to you by the computer with a number of single jpg images sprinkled in here and there... I would have been much happier with a higher priced (if necessary) DVD-ROM based PC game that installs several movie clips onto your PC... perhaps a set of two or four dual layer DVD's.  For a game like that I'd gladly pay sixty dollars.

I feel that the thirty five dollars spent on this was a complete waste of money and if it wasn't for the fact that I'd only receive fourteen dollars back (plus subtracting the cost to mail this back to amazon) I'd definitely return it..in good conscience I can't even entertain the thought of selling it used because I'd hate for anyone else to feel as cheated as I was.... peach princess's website makes no mention of still images (versus movie/video) being used in this game on their website which I find absolutely shocking.  And it's a shame really because I'm a big fan of hentai anime - this game could have had so much potential if it was only ""programmed"" the right way.

If you're even considering purchasing this game I would strongly recommend you go with either hentai anime (animetric gives some excellent reviews of this sort of thing) or if you really want an erotic PC game purchase Virtual Hottie 2 - it's not anime and it lacks a plotline of any sort but at least it has the full motion video that's so sorely lacking in XChange 2.",1184198400,3,2532,4.529540481400438
