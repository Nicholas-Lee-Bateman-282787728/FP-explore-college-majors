5157541,4,B008F5HOYW,"I purchased this DVD and was happy about it.  I knew already there were only 4 episodes but then I thought that it could of used a couple more of the episodes that were ""scary"". Like when Shawn and Gus went to the Fright Fest fairgrounds and witnessed a murder.  That would of been good and also when the girl was supposedly possessed by the devil.  All in all I really wished I hadn't bought this one. I could of used the money towards buying Season 6 and then completing my collection.  But you can never have enough of Shawn and Gus !!!!!",1350259200,10,541,4.223300970873787

5157581,5,B008F5HOYW,"A collection of four Halloween themed shows taken from various seasons.  One deals with mummies, another with vampires, a third is reminiscent of Friday the 13th, and the fourth has elements of The Shining with a tad bit of Rosemary's Baby.  A great theme collection to have available on one disc and reasonably priced.  The chemistry between Shawn and Gus make them a delight to watch as it truly is a match made in heaven.  Love all four, but my favorites were Heeeeere's Lassie and Tuesday the 17th. A must reasonably priced must have for all Psych Fans.",1385251200,3,557,4.653061224489796
5157582,4,B008F5HOYW,"""Psych"" loves it some horror parodies, whether it's slashers, ghosts or the undead.

And that is exactly what you get in ""Psych: The Psych-O-Ween Collection,"" which brings together four ""scary"" episodes of the mystery-comedy series. These are all excellent episodes, with mummies, vampires and occasionally a crazed camp killer. Its only flaw is the absence of some of the obvious episodes -- why would you not have werewolves in a Halloween collection?

""Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead"": Shawn is hired to find a mummy that has gone missing -- and immediately finds that it walked out of the room (much to Gus's terror). Then they stumble across the night watchman, who has been strangled to death by ancient Egyptian bandages. Is an undead mummy on the loose, or is something Shawn and Gus can actually deal with?

""Tuesday the 17th"": Shawn and Gus are invited to the grand reopening of Camp Tikihama by their old campmate Jason, because a camp counselor has gone missing. Things get incredibly spooky and scary... and then normal again... only for real murders to start happening, conveniently when the phones and roads are out. Shawn must figure out who the true camp psycho slasher is before they all end up dead.

""This Episode Sucks"": A dead body is found, drained of blood, which starts up rumors that a vampire is on the loose. And as Gus and Shawn help Lassiter and Juliet investigate (while dressed as vampires), they discover that there may be a connection between the dead body and a mysterious woman (Kristy Swanson) whom Lassiter has fallen in love with.

""""Heeeeere's Lassie"": After a man commits suicide, Lassiter buys the guy's condo for himself and his lady love. But the place seems to be haunted -- chairs stacked on the table, creepy twins, eccentric neighbors, blood in the light fixtures and weird dreams.  He reluctantly hires Shawn and Gus to investigate the goings-on in the building -- but can they solve the case before Lassie goes Jack Torrance on them?

Obviously there are no real supernatural woes in ""Psych,"" but that doesn't keep weird Halloweeny things from happening on a semi-regular basis. Each of these episodes has a pretty solid murder mystery at the heart of it, while also dealing with Shawn and Gus' way of dealing with possible hauntings, vampires, mummies and a guy with a machete.

The closest to a ""serious"" episode is the vampire one, which doesn't seem entirely comfortable with embracing the whole bloodsucker theme. The others really leap headfirst into their themes (""I've seen enough slasher movies to know that when a brother goes off to the woods, he doesn't even sort of come back!"") and have lots of pop culture references and horror tropes woven in.

And of course, they allow Shawn and Gus to be silly. Sometimes they're happily joining in on the madness (dressing up as Lestat and Blacula), and sometimes they're scared out of their pants (Gus's phobia about the mummy's curse). But they're always fun to watch, and the comedy rarely slows down even during the climaxes (""She's got the crazy coursing through her legs!"").

The biggest problem with ""The Psych-O-Ween Collection""? It could have used a few more of the ""scary"" episodes -- for some reason, they didn't include ""Let's Get Hairy,"" ""Ghosts"" or ""Scary Sherry: Bianca's Toast,"" even though all of them are perfect candidates! Werewolves, witches and ghosts, people!

""Psych: The Psych-O-Ween Collection"" has a solid little selection of spooky-themed ""Psych"" episodes, although it could have used two or three more. But it's still a fun diversion.",1381017600,19,3563,4.941471571906354

it clear that this is a waste of time & money [if you have the complete series]. I'll address THAT,
here:
1.) This is a themed-sampler (for Hallowe'en).
2.) As such, someone curious about BUYING a season would be interested in a taste.
3.) I bought one, and, since a few reviewers mentioned it, I bought SEASON ONE for another
Halloween episode.
