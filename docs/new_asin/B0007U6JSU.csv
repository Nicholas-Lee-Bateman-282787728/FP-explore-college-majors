8051748,5,B0007U6JSU,"This 44-minute VHS videotape was produced in the year 1989, and contains six short films that have been used as visual exhibits at the Dallas, Texas, museum which pays tribute to the memory of assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy (who was killed from the very building which houses that museum, the former Texas School Book Depository at 411 Elm Street on the western edge of downtown Dallas).

The six films on this video provide a short, but good, general overview of JFK as President, as well as information about the day he died (November 22, 1963).

The full title of this video is: ""Films From The Sixth Floor Museum: John F. Kennedy And The Memory Of A Nation"". The tape comes nicely packaged in a plastic clamshell case, with a familiar color photo on the front cover showing President Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy riding in the Dallas motorcade on 11/22/63 shortly before the gunshots were fired.

This hard-to-find VHS tape features the Full-Frame video format (1.33:1) and crisp-sounding Hi-Fi audio. Tape speed is Standard Play (SP).

Here's some more information about this video product (taken directly from the back cover of the tape itself):
