7824917,2,6302332737,"This film shouldn't be taken that seriously, it's awful & dumb. Some of the reviewers seem really [upset]! I don't blame them.
 The original ""Basket Case"" movie was a well made chiller. Part 3 scrapes the bottom of the barrel. It picks up where part 2 ended... almost the same ugly faces star in this one too.
Avoid watching this while you're eating. A Low budget, uninteresting little film.

The guys in the look like not people ,but momsters instead with very stupid teeth. I done saw the picture at the TV and it doesnt make the sense.the guys in there are supposed to be disfigured guys, but look like monsters and not real guys or guys who are real but just freaks. (i know a guy with 3 legs.) There is a guy with all these arms and he looks like Humplik. Its nuts. No you don't get it, they look like these things, not deformed people. Its nuts. You guys are nuts.",1009670400,4,582,3.982905982905983

7824920,1,6302332737,"Alright, I've seen some pretty bad films in my day, but this takes the cake.  It can't even touch such quality works as Manos: Hands of Fate or Troll in terms of badness.  There is absolutely no point to this film, and  I suggest that you remember that before even dropping 99 cents on it when  you go to rent it at the video store.  The only possible purpose of this  film is to torture your friends, but if you are sitting through the 90  minutes yourself, it almost isn't worth it.  Avoid this film unless  heavily, heavily inebriated.  Whatever themes and serious ideas people try  to say are in this film don't exist.  Please, avoid this, if not for my  sake, for yours.",953596800,2,675,4.346774193548387
