3674579,5,B001KZAP2C,"yet again, another superb product from Tony Sweet! I have both all of his books, and DVD,s and there is not a dud amongst them! I admire his photographic styles, and am always trying to emulate them ,and look forward to his next book! (due early next year)",1245715200,,256,4.354166666666667
3674580,5,B001KZAP2C,"This is an excellent introduction to HDR photography.  While the process section for each image is probably more important, I also found the set up section both useful and interesting.  Tony is an enthusiastic teacher who knows how to impart knowledge to his viewers.
Buyers should be aware that it is assumed that you have some knowledge of Photoshop.  This is not a complete course on Photomatix; Photomatix requires use and experimentation.",1236729600,5,443,5.125
3674581,2,B001KZAP2C,"This is not an instructional DVD on how to use the Photomatix software program.  The product description needs clarification:  You need BOTH Photomatic and Photoshop to use this DVD.  There is no mention of Photoshop in the product description.  If you are looking for a DVD that teaches how to produce HDR photos using Photomatix, this is probably not it. It is not a step-by-step companion guide.  I found the instruction to be very general and moved too quickly.",1235606400,13,465,4.8354430379746836
3674582,5,B001KZAP2C,"This is a great DVD, very happy with the purchase. I am not exactly a beginner HDR, I am new to it,  but this DVD is designed for someone who knows nothing about it. I recommend it.",1233273600,5,181,3.891891891891892
3674583,5,B001KZAP2C,"Within minutes of starting to watch Tony Sweet's DVD ""HDR Photography Made Easy"" I realized the time spent was going to bring my photography to a new level. The production of the DVD compliments Tony's conversational development of high end photo processing. It really is the whole package for someone who wants to take HDR Photography to new places.",1232150400,7,350,4.9491525423728815
3674584,5,B001KZAP2C,"Tony got me started in HDR at his St. Michaels, Maryland, workshop last summer and, since then, I have felt pretty comfortable working HDR with most images.  However, when I was in West Virginia last year I got access to an old mill that was being restored.  There were no lights inside so it was very dark in most area, and bright sun was flowing through the few windows that were there.  Most of my image sequences were 9 shots (8 stops...wow).  So when I ran then through HDR software they just were not doing anything for me.  Then a friend of min bought this DVD for me for my Birthday.  It absolutely takes HDR processing up to a whole new level.  After watching the DVD I realized that I did have a chance with some of these shots that I had given up on.  Tony shows HDR techniques that I never thought of.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.",1231459200,13,843,4.251572327044025

8316579,3,B001KZAP2C,"Good for a beginner in HDR and ""Photomatix Pro"".  I would have liked to see more in depth on the affect of the controls in ""Photomatix Pro"".  Some actual examples for the user work along with the author  would have been great.  All in all I give it a C  content and a D for cost.",1304035200,,279,3.9107142857142856
8316580,4,B001KZAP2C,"I purchased this DVD hoping to learn advanced techniques. I didn't.  The program is more for beginners.  I covers ever aspect of Photomatix, and then some.  But then again, that's the program that I've been using for a couple of years so nothing new there.  Tony Sweet's delivery is good, not great.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to learn HDR.  However, if you already know Photomatix and you want to go to the next step this is not the DVD for you.",1299196800,,468,4.383720930232558
8316581,4,B001KZAP2C,It is okay.  Just be prepared to take notes and view the DVD several times until you lean the techniques of Tony Sweet in the use of the Photomatix software for HDR imaging. Tony Sweet is an excellent photogrpahy instructor as well as an excellent pro photography.,1292716800,,264,4.617021276595745
8316582,5,B001KZAP2C,"This was my first DVD by Tony Sweet. I was pleasantly surprised by Tony's instruction and the high quality of the video production itself.

Tony takes the time to go over what he did and WHY he did. He's a natural teacher and I look forward to more of his DVD's and perhaps even a book or two in the future.

As a person that had only the most basic knowledge of HDR, I came away informed, inspired and more confident after watching the (nearly 2 hours of instruction) DVD.",1278460800,3,473,4.2444444444444445
8316583,4,B001KZAP2C,"Bought this along with several books on HDR photography. Watching the DVD was like spending time with Tony - a great experience. However, it should be noted that, to receive the best value from this DVD you really need to watch the DVD, go out and take some photos, run them through the software and then watch the DVD AGAIN. The second viewing will allow you to receive the most benefit from Tony's instruction.
Tony shows you how he sets up his camera/tripod, techniques for bracketing and how he ""processes"" the images - in fact, he spends a great deal of time going through which sliders he is using and why. This is a very ""organic"" process (each image needs its own unique touch) and you start to get the ""feeling"" about which adjustments work together - and which cancel each other out. This is very important to know when as you start to process your own images.",1268352000,6,870,4.512658227848101
8316584,5,B001KZAP2C,"To begin with, if you're interested in HDR photography I would recommend this DVD tutorial from Mr. Sweet.

Understand that in order to use the Photomatix software (abt $100) discussed , recommend capturing your images in RAW or Tiff format, I have not tried Jpeg's with the software.  Additionally, though one single image can be used (which creates a false HDR), it's best to use a minimum of two or more photos for processing.  Though Photoshop alone can merge multiple photos together to create an HDR picture, my experience with Photomatix has been extremely positive.  Mr. Sweet does not provide a technical ""tour-de-force"" about the software, but he does walk us through each individual processing setting capable of being utilized in the software.

Mr. Sweet provides instruction on the way he chooses to process his HDR photos (which may differ from others), and I learned quite a bit from watching the DVD.  He teaches how to read the histogram of our camera (assuming you have a histogram) and that is the single most important feature required to produce the best images.  Simple point and shoot camera owners I believe will have a difficult time.  You'll need some sort of pro-level camera.  My Nikon D40 works fine.

Photoshop is not required software (as one review suggested), however, some sort of post processing software is - Mr. Sweet chooses Photomatix.  He simply utilizes Photoshop for specific targeted adjustments after the fact.

He provides step by step instruction for processing the first image (total of ten image processing segments are provided) and circumvents the other nine images to save time.  In my opinion, once you process your first image you'll have an understanding how the software faders work.

Shot on location at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, Mr. Sweet tours the prison and selects some fantastic prison cells, hallways, etc. which offer high contrast scenes and are perfect for this type of photography.  Please understand that he is a professional photographer with professional equipment.

I would not recommend this DVD to the novice photographer who lacks the proper equipment.  But to those of you with a basic understanding how your DSLR camera works, has a tripod, computer, and is willing to purchase Photomatix software (at a minimum) I think you'll enjoy Mr. Sweet's instruction.  I have watched the DVD multiple times, and each time I pick up on something new.",1267833600,12,2433,5.085642317380352
8316585,5,B001KZAP2C,"If you have an interest in HDR then this is the video for you.
This guy is very good and he explains step by step what he is doing.
I love the place he is shooting too, it is a great place for HDR.
If you want to see a sample of his work before you buy this DVD go to YouTube and search on his name. He has one of the lessons on Youtube. This might help you determine whether you like his style or not.",1261958400,3,402,3.632183908045977
8316586,2,B001KZAP2C,"I was a disappointed in this DVD because the content was entirely passive, there were no example images included for me to work with.

Mr. Sweet seems to be more concerned with improving his income stream than actually providing valid education. He provides just barely enough information to ensure you can't say you've been ripped off and not one whit more.

I did learn a little bit more about using photomatix than I knew before viewing the DVD, since Mr. Sweet explained in acceptably sufficient detail about single image tonemapping to allow me to use the technique.

Mr. Sweets shooting technique leaves a lot to be desired, but I used to shoot 4x5 exclusively and have higher expectations of professionalism and performance than most. He got the job done, and his images look fine but I'm far from impressed.

If I could ethically return the DVD and ask for my money back I would.

My suggestion is to save your money, let Mr. Sweet line his pockets with someone elses hard earned dough and keep searching for a substantive learning opportunity because this isn't one.",1250553600,7,1075,4.789189189189189
8316587,5,B001KZAP2C,Once again I'll mention that I'm in my 60's and a dinosaur who has a 1970's Master's Degree in Photography.  I understand photography but am learning digital.  I have looked at a number of HDR images and was fascinated.  I wanted to know how they did it.  Someday I may try this technique.  I have watched the DVD and find it very well done.  Another block in my digital education foundation.,1247184000,3,392,4.450704225352113
