8155251,2,B000K98648,Dmitri is not teaching anything.  He just translate words to English here and there. It still great to take the Russian Ballet Lesson at home but description is very deceiving.,1496620800,,176,4.866666666666666

8155253,5,B000K98648,"I enjoy watching these DVD's by Dmitri, they are well done and I feel like I'm being transported to Russia.  The music is exceptional and the models can execute the steps in an easy way so that you can do them yourself.  I have a number of his products and am not displeased with any of them.",1385337600,4,292,4.105263157894737
8155254,5,B000K98648,"This was a great product...I fell in love the moment I put the DVD in. Dimitri is easy to follow. This is definitely an ""in class"" DVD with the emphasis on ballet and technique and terminology. This seller had a great product for a great price! The DVD works perfectly. I was really happy with my purchase! I purchased all three!",1298592000,10,329,4.409836065573771
8155255,4,B000K98648,"This DVD allows you to skip thru exercises with ease via the menu.  Very thorough and executed. It's a bit advanced, but with repitition it will become easier.  Love this DVD.",1270252800,12,175,4.612903225806452
8155256,5,B000K98648,"I loved this class.  I speak Russian and I loved hearing the Russian teacher give corrections(the corrections are translated into English).  I also studied with a Vaganova teacher for a number of years and the exercises in this dvd are right out of the Vaganova system.  There are tons of jump combinations, and there is variety of pointe exercises at the end of class.  This is a great value for the price.  At is a great teacher training dvd as well as a do-along class for home.",1172275200,45,481,4.482758620689655
