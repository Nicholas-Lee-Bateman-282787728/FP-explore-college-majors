8178138,5,B000NJCW7W,"This is a very good quality DVD-R from Nostalgia Family Video.  There are no superimposed logos, the feature is complete with all original credits, and there are no extras.  We could all die waiting on Universal to release it.",1370044800,,226,4.769230769230769
8178139,4,B000NJCW7W,"I happen to think that the young Joan Bennett was one of the knock-out females ever to grace the screen. How could I not enjoy seeing her as the millionairess masquerading as a down on her luck American in Paris with a ne'er do well father (well played by Charlie Grapewin). Mary Boland is her usual comical pseudo matron self while Monte Woolly makes two brief appearances. Oh, yes, also on hand, is the redoubtable Jack Benny, still close to the comedy leadership on radio, and in the midst of his, pretty much, annual, film making. Admittedly, with the exception of a classic film in the forties (To Be or Not To Be)and some better than average ones in the same decade ( George Washington Slept Here and The Horn Blows at Midnight), he never was allowed to develop the comic persona that he did in Radio and TV. Still, he is worth watching. The plot provides opportunity for a glorious, in living black and white,fashion show and some nice musical interludes by the Yacht Club Boys,but it is still a movie made to show the public what a radio star looks like and to give the audience some respite from the anxieties induced by The Great Depression.
It is fun to watch, whatever may be your reasons for doing so;  and, it is a voyage into nostalgia, seeing performers who are no longer around and a form of film which is no longer being made.",1346889600,,1344,4.463414634146342
