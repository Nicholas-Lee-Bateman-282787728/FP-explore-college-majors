526169,4,6302985277,"I don't yet own this set, but look forward to soon. My only gripe, besides a few bad movies, is the fact not all are presented in wide screen. I understand several of the older films were originally filmed in a 3X4 aspect ratio, that's fine. What I don't understand is why some films like the award winner Annie Hall isn't offered in it's original wide screen format? Especially since Roadhouse is. If these are the classics, why not give us the original director's vision? And I'm glad they included many of the 2 disc editions of films such as Rocky and Raging Bull.",1199491200,21,568,4.471153846153846
526170,5,6302985277,I love it. I just received my set from another dealer and it is a real thrill. I sold off some the movies I owned in it previously and am glad I did. The set is luxurious and has most of the newest versions of the movies. I was able to sell the 35 movies I owned in it to nearly come up with the funds to purchase the 90 movies contained here for a nice exchange. The book is very nice as well as the metal and glass structure that holds it. Look for a bargain on it with help from coupons.,1198022400,15,490,3.766990291262136
526171,5,6302985277,"I have been looking all over the web for this set and everyone is out of stock.

I am a movie buff and have been a huge fan of United Artists releases for decades.  When I found out about this gift set containing 90 movies on 110 DVD's I was blown away.  Just look at the list of contained movies, they are nearly all classics and some great newer titles as well.  I have spent the last few weeks looking for the set for myself and a close friend for a Xmas gift who I used to watch many of these titles with.  My search is finally over!
If you are looking for a fantastic holiday gift for the movie buff on your list, look no further.  I just hope they have enough for everyone interested.
3 thumbs up!",1198022400,21,703,4.0215827338129495
526172,3,6302985277,"Okay, United Artists has been around since 1919, and where are all of the films from the company's early days?  One would think that a collection proposing to highlight 90 years of a great film studio's output might... just might... include some of the glories from UA's formative period.  Sure, there is a lot of good stuff here, but the title doesn't give a good indication of what this box set is all about, and the absence of those early films just doesn't do it for me.",1197072000,29,474,4.436781609195402
526173,5,6302985277,"The other reviews here seem to be about some individual movie. I'm reviewing the United Artists Super Deluxe Gift Set.

Warner Home Video has put out these giant megasets before, and now United Artists is doing the same thing. However, United Artists has less boxed sets on the market than Warner does, so your chances of double dipping are less in this collection. However, there is some danger of double dips. In particular United Artists has best picture collections, musical collections, Woody Allen collections, and James Bond collections that all duplicate movies in this bunch. On the bright side, for the films that have double disc editions, that is what they are offering, also the total price works out to a little under six dollars per disc, which is not bad. Do remember though, in single disc editions, United Artists/MGM seldom put any extras in with their movies. The highlights of this collection are:
1. 5 James Bond films - On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me, The Living Daylights, Goldeneye, Dr. No
2. Best Picture winners - Marty (1955), The Apartment (1960), West Side Story (Widescreen, 2-Disc) 1961, In the Heat of the Night (1967), Midnight Cowboy - 2-Disc (1969), Rocky- 2 Disc Edition (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Rain Man (1988)
3. Some classic Spencer Tracy performances - ""Judgement at Nuremburg"", ""Inherit the Wind"", ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World""
4. Some classic noir in ""Woman in the Window"", ""The Killing"", and ""Night of the Hunter"".
5. Many other classic films such as ""The Defiant Ones"", ""The Miracle Worker"", ""Good, Bad, and the Ugly"" 2 Disc edition, ""Birdman of Alcatraz"", ""Elmer Gantry"", and ""I Want To Live"" among others.

There is some junk hiding among the classics -
""The Man in the Iron Mask"" - Not DiCaprio's finest hour and obviously made just to capitalize on his power to draw teenage girls to the box office shortly after his Titanic fame.
""Road House"" - 1989 film that is the stuff adolescent male dreams are made of - beautiful girls that fall for drifters and a chance to be macho and get paid for it.
""Heaven's Gate"" - A long expensive boring 1980 western that led United Artists into bankruptcy. For a studio to start with Mary Pickford and Charles Chaplin and to end up here...oh the agony.

Overall this package consists largely of both old and modern classics with just a few junk movies thrown in. You have to expect that, how else is United Artists going to get anyone to buy the last three films I mentioned? Overall, a very good buy if you can afford it and if you haven't double-dipped too much in other collections already.",1192233600,218,2601,4.737306843267108
526315,4,6302985277,"reading through the list it starts to look like an impressive collection.  but then two different versions of movies like  Living Daylights (the worst Bond movie ever made)?  Red Dawn and Roadhouse?  slapped on as an homage to Patrick Swayze?

but you can still throw away this junk and have a fine summary collection of great films.  i hesitate buying it simply from the reviews of questionable quality of the DVDs themselves.",1266537600,,427,4.861111111111111

7832849,2,6302985277,"Great idea, poor execution.  I was really excited to purchase the collection, and was looking forward to watching the 90 films over the course of the next year.  Unfortunately, the packaging of this product made this impossible to do.  The collection comes inside a metal box which holds everything together, but as soon as you remove the actual book that contains the dvds things fall apart.
Both the front and back covers of the book were torn off, and at least half of the dvds had come out of their sleeves.  They were obviously scuffed up, and while it's possible that all of them would have worked, there was no way that I could watch all of those movies in enough time to be able to return the collection in the specified time, so back it went.

I think that UA should include a hotline number for sellers to provide their customers guaranteeing a replacement disc whenever necessary.  If I had been assured that any of the discs would have been replaced, I would have been willing to live with the torn covers...even at the $350 cost.

I considered ordering the smaller set as a compromise (hoping that less dvds meant that the book would hold together better), but the reviews of that product are similar.  I hope that for UA's 100th anniversary, they go back to the drawing board and come up with a better product.",1419120000,2,1324,4.556962025316456

United Artists and MGM aren't known to provide many extras for their films as is the case here. Most of the films are widescreen but not all. We do get 5 James Bond films, Best Picture Winners, Spencer Tracy films, Woody Allen films, musicals, film noirs, and many other classics. It also has some films you wouldn't normally own (Road House, Heaven's Gate, The Man in the Iron Mask and others). They are worth watching but seem to be tossed into this set. Ultimately, you are better off purchasing your favorite films individually on Blu-ray because this set is a mixed bag and too pricey for its content.
