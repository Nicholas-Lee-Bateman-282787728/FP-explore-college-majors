2644430,4,B000HWZ4IY,"I watched every episode of every season and was slightly disappointed by the end of it all.  I know what I did not like was the way the show typicallly dealt with the characters who left it.  When Barney left, there was no explanation given for way too long.  When his replacement just disappeared, I don't remember any explanation being given.  When Otis all but disappeared I recall no reason being given.  After his first girlfriend disappeared, nothing was said.  As annoying as these oversites were, by far the worst was how Andy's leaving was never dealt with.  I never watched Mayberry RFD; maybe something was said during that show, but it should have been handled during the original show.  Overall, this seemed to show a lack of respect for the actors/characters who contributed so much to this classic show.",1464566400,,818,4.792857142857143

2644468,4,B000HWZ4IY,"I remember watching these color episodes years ago and although Don Knotts was no longer on the show there were some fun episodes. I agree with some other reviewers that Andy Griffith did seem more serious or maybe just burned out and this final year he didn't seem to have his heart in the show. This happens I suppose with some actors that feel they are being type cast and want to go on to other things.
It is interesting to see some of the new characters and also watching Opie grow up.",1462406400,,490,4.279569892473118

2644549,5,B000HWZ4IY,"Season 8 is the last season.  In color.  There are may really good episodes including Aunt Bee being more adventurous as she had become beginning in Season 6, and Opie growing up from a pre-tween to a young teenager.  The last three episodes introduce the main character, played by Ken Berry (Capt Parmetter of F Troop fame) of the Andy Griffith spin off -- Mayberry RFD, which itself lasted 4 seasons across 78 episodes.  The last episode of Andy Griffith is a bit anti climatic and is really the first episode of Mayberry RFD.  There was no teary eyed final episode. I guess they didn't do that back then with last episodes.  I read some of the same Andy Griffith characters continue into the spin off..Howard Sprague the town clerk, Goober Pyle from the gas station, Emmett Clark from the Fix It Shop that had replaced Floyd the barber who had moved to a nearby town to open a bigger shop, and Aunt Bee who is in one of about every 3 Mayberry RFD episodes.

2645095,5,B000HWZ4IY,"I was a child of the 1960's and when this series came out I was a toddler and when it went off the air I was 7 years old. I have seen every episode so many times I know them by heart through the decades. I bought all the seasons of the series and the movie too. Many of the reunion DVD's and specials. My favorite character was Miss Crump and I know she wasn't many people's favorite but I loved her and Opie. Aunt Bee and Floyd were crack ups. This series is still on today and shown all over the world, I always stop and watch when it is on TV and every so often pull out my dvd's and go back to a simpler time when life didn't seem so harsh and bad. I always laugh along with Barney, Andy, Goober and Gomer the entire gang brings so much laughter the double dates with Thelma Lou and Helen. Great for the entire family and still holds up today as great quality program. There are not enough stars for this show five is not enough.",1396915200,,933,3.9946524064171123
2645096,4,B000HWZ4IY,This is a great show that just got caught in a technology change. It lost a bit of its charm when it switched to color. The show also lost its idenity. But it still offers much more quality substance than the sitcoms these days that seem to be written in a boys Junior High school locker room.,1396656000,,293,4.157894736842105
2645097,3,B000HWZ4IY,"TAGS season 8 is my least favorite.  Like so many reviewers have said, a so so season of Andy is better than a number 1 rated sit-com today.  I find that seasons 3-6 epitomize the show for me.  The first couple of seasons Andy is too comical, grinning ear to ear and the last season he(Andy) just isn't there.  Still,  I love the show and it is definitely on my mt rushmore of tv sit-coms.  That makes the season worth the purchase.  Its hard to understand why some people would not enjoy this show.  I think it speaks volumes about an individuals value system and personality.  The calm,reflective, and serene individual probably loves what the show has to offer.  The alpha personality probably finds the show lame,corny, or timid.  I feel for those individuals.  I could watch an episode of Andy,Barney,Aunt Bea, and Opie sitting on the porch just listening to the crickets chirping and find peace and tranquility.  Thats just me.  For my money,  the best seasons are the middle ones. Andy as the all knowing sage surrounded by quirky personalities.  He never misses a beat.",1396224000,,1077,4.679144385026738

He comes back to Mayberry and he is sunburnt and lies to everyone that the lawyer was a guy. NO ONE gets of Andys back and try to figure out who he was with.

2645151,4,B000HWZ4IY,"Season 8 is the last one for The Andy Griffith Show, and thats fitting given the number of old characters who no longer appear.  Barney Fife only makes it for one episode, Floyd is gone, no Thelma Lou, no Otis, no mayorand in their place are Howard Sprague and Emmett Clark.  I like Howard and Emmett, but they aren't as great as the old characters that made the show so fun.  Even though its hard not to miss Barney, Floyd, and the rest, many of these episodes are still funny.  Besides several storylines about Howard and Emmett, like Howard falling in love with Millie and Emmett going to work as an insurance salesman, some of the episodes focus on Goober and his own new love interest.  A few episodes toward the end of the season set up the spinoff show, Mayberry R.F.D., including the pilot of that show.  Its sad that The Andy Griffith Show had to come to an end, but from everything I read, Griffith was tired of playing the character, and with so many important characters gone, it made sense to finish the show with Season 8.  It might not reach the standards of the five black-and-white seasons, but it still offers plenty of laughs and good times in Mayberry.  This show has yet to be topped as my all time favorite TV comedy.",1385424000,,1239,4.427312775330397

I learned a lot about being a father from the countless ""Andy and Opie"" father/son talks which would help me years later as I raised five sons.  The show is timeless and quite literally the most entertaining television show I've ever seen in my 57 years.  Being a native southerner I have always loved the honest, down home charm of the show and the final season does not disappoint nor deviate from that charm.

My parents taped them and I watched them over and over and over again. Many of the black and white episodes with Barney, I have seen well over 100 times I'm sure if not more and I never get tired of them. They actually get funnier with age. The show was good clean fun that the whole family could enjoy. The creators and actors of TAGS were brilliant. They knew how to make comedy clean and hillarious at the same time. Unlike the trash that you see on TV today. The first 5 seasons of this show was by far the best, but the entire series was great overall. I wish more shows today were like The Andy Griffith Show.

""Howard's New Life"" is unbelievable and mostly wierd, but it has its funny moments when Howard first moves in and sizes up his new home.  ""Barney Hosts a Summitt Meeting"" is also unbelievable, but it turns out to be the best of his ""return shows"" since leaving the series.  At the end their are four transistion shows with Ken Berry being established as farmer Sam Jones for the new series ""Mayberry RFD"".

It seems that Barney Fife (Don Knotts) really made this show, because without him in this season there is a sense of incompleteness in the casting.

But the ""color years"" (seasons 6 through 8), as controversial as they are among fans, still contain a wealth of material that's far superior to what passes as a ""sitcom"" on modern television. The final season carried on without Floyd (one of the most vital characters, next to Barney Fife). It featured an extreme overdose of Howard Sprague...reminds me of the old SCTV skit in which ""Floyd"" (Eugene Levy) goes to Godfather ""Don Caballero"" (Joe Flaherty) to ""ask a favor""...""I want you to kill Howard Sprague""...now THAT'S classic. The one essential episode in the final season is ""Opie's Group""...it's true classic television cheese as Opie rocks the nation, stopping only to have Emmett at the Fix-It shop ""adjust his amp"" (perhaps to make it go to 11?)...If you love rock and roll, and you love the Andy Griffith show, get season 8. You'll be reminded of Van Halen's song ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"" as Opie goes to the edge, stands and looks down, loses a lot of friends there, and...well, just GET IT.",1174176000,,1129,4.794871794871795

2645418,5,B000HWZ4IY,"I'm so glad these DVD box sets exist, because they gave a twenty-something such as myself the opportunity to become acquainted with one of America's finest television programs. It took me nearly a year, but I've finally made my way through the entire run...

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) back in Season 1 to move in with him and six-year-old Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

In this season, Opie is entering adolescence, as is addressed by episodes such as ""Opie's Girlfriend,"" where the 13-year-old wants to take his crush to a friend's party, but finds she's waiting for a better offer.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Goober, the friendly, childlike mechanic; Helen, Andy's girlfriend and Opie's teacher; Howard, the shy county clerk who's just beginning to come out from under his mother's thumb. This season also introduces store owner Emmett, and Sam, who will replace Andy as sheriff in the spinoff, ""Mayberry R.F.D.""

One of my main peeves is Andy and Helen's endless courtship. How many times in the past few seasons has ""X comes to town, and makes Andy or Helen jealous"" come into the storyline? It gets incredibly tedious to see over and over again. If they were THAT jealous, they'd simply get married or else just break up. But they continue ""going together"" for years, as though they are adolescents. Eventually, they do marry, but it happens in the spin-off...so as far as TAGS viewers are concerned, it's like it *never* happens.

Plus, Sam becomes a key character in the last few episodes. All of a sudden, he's practically Andy's best friend...when no one ever heard of him before. I understand they're trying to set up the characters for the spin-off, but seriously! Make it a LITTLE believable...

I also don't like the way Floyd simply disappears, like Ellie, Warren and a few others. Floyd, however, was a central character for SEVEN CONSECUTIVE SEASONS - the least they could do is give some sort of exposition for his leaving, and not insult viewers' intelligence.

If you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try! You'll soon be searching for the previous seasons.",1169510400,,2676,4.853070175438597

2645421,4,B000HWZ4IY,"Well, it's finally over. The final season of tags. In this last season you can see that Andy is tired, Aunt Bee is old & Opie is growing up. This season is good if you just want to complete your collection of tags. There are some funny episodes in this set. When Howard goes to the south seas is pretty funny. The show had a good run, although they lost something when Barney left the show, they did manage to keep it going for a couple of years. I really didn't get into the next set which is Mayberry RFD. They tried but, like everything else, all good things must come to an end. Barney shows up for one last time when he hosts a summit meeting. You can see that Don knotts is getting old & tried also. By this season he is well on his way making movies & didn't have time for the tags show anymore. Gomer has his own show also. You can see that Floyd's barber shop has been turned into Emmet's fix it shop. Nothing is the same in this last season. We will miss you all very much. luckly, we have the other seasons & all of the great memories of the show to look back on. So, farewell old friends!!!!!!!!",1167436800,,1107,4.08256880733945
2645422,4,B000HWZ4IY,"Well, Paramount has finally gotten all 8 seasons out and what a treat is has been to have them all.  Would have liked to had more extras but to get the episodes complete and uncut, and at a very reasonable price has been just great.

Again, season 8 is probably the weakest year, but it's still Andy.  Some episodes Andy does look like he's sleepwalking through the motions.  But, for me, the best part is to see these episodes without all the syndication cuts for the first time since original broadcast.  In many ways, it's like seeing these for the first time.

For me, the epilogue in the episode ""Howard's New Life"" sums up the essence of Mayberry.  Goober, Andy, Emmett, and Howard sitting around the gas station at sunset having a bottle of pop.  Listening to the crickets chirping and the dogs barking and enjoying a bottle of soda is just awesome!

Well done Andy!!!!",1166572800,,876,4.564102564102564
2645423,3,B000HWZ4IY,"One of the all-time greatest TV shows ends with no fanfare; it lopes along for 30 shows until the very last episode.  This last season DOES have it's memorable moments though: Goober is mis-matched with computer dating, Howard retires to a tropical island, Howard turns his house into a swingin' bachelor pad, Andy discovers Helen was arrested in Kansas City and Barney visits & turns the Taylor home into a summit meeting.

We still have Andy, Opie, Aunt Bee and Clara Edwards; but by this time, many characters we came to love on this show were gone: Floyd, Otis, Ernest T. Bass, Gomer, Barney, Thelma Lou, The Darling Family, Rafe Hollister, Leon, Ben Weaver and other lesser but recognizable town characters, like the one played by Burt Mustin. Instead, we have the replacements: Goober, Howard, Emmett & Martha Clark and, by the last four episodes, Sam & Mike Jones. These last four episodes are hard to watch, as Ken Berry just doesn't fit in. Berry was great on ""F-Troop"" and ""Mama's Family,"" but here his character is as bland and useless as soggy cardboard...and when his son Mike calls him ""Paw,"" there's no southern twang in his voice; he sounds like a geeky city boy! The final show (basically, the pilot for ""Mayberry R.F.D."") is so wretched, I couldn't even watch it...(Sam hires an Italian family to work on his farm); it was so UNLIKE an Andy Griffith Show episode, that I couldn't sit through it...I had to take the disc out and put it away!

Andy was the wise, all-knowing and humble caretaker at the beginning of the series; after Don Knotts left, Andy became surly and made more and more mistakes; by this final season, a lot of the surliness had left and he mellowed somewhat, just going through the motions, knowing the end was finally coming.

I know I'm knocking this final season, but that's because I care about the show. If you're a fan like me, you'll buy it to complete the collection and enjoy the good moments on this package.",1166313600,,1957,4.663768115942029
2645424,2,B000HWZ4IY,"As this is my all time favorite television show, it's hard to admit that this season was running on fumes. The best characters were dead or had moved on. Andy seemed like he was in a mad mood most of the time, and Don Knotts was gone. Ken Berry being brought in at the last to be set up for Mayberry R.F.D. was not a good idea. I will probably buy this so my set will be complete, but it's kind of sad to watch.",1164067200,,411,3.847058823529412
2645425,1,B000HWZ4IY,"The Andy Griffith Show WAS and still is one of the best sitcoms tv ever produced. We all know that stars with the great Don Knotts leading the pack but seldom is the show's main star mentioned: The town of Mayberry. It serves as both stage and star. Mayberry exists as an America that even when first seen is thought of as a bygone era. It is what WE WANTED America to have been like. Most people don't know the amazing history of Andy Griffith. He was a famous stand up comedian known nation wide. Studied Shakespeare, had a huge Broadway hit with 'No Time For Sergeants' that translated well into a motion picture (with Don Knotts). He also should have won the Oscar for best actor for his mesmorizing performance in the classic ""A Face In The Crowd"" a movie that was way way well ahead of it's time, think Network and you'll get the idea. The movie is more relevant today than it was when it was made. Go BUY it now instead of this dvd.

When the Andy Griffith show first aired it did not have Don Knotts. But everything came together when it did and Griffith's generosity as the lead and famous comedian gave everything to Knotts. It was great for the show and the reason it is still funny to this date. But Mayberry existed in our memories as a town that never really existed and so it Had to be fimed in black & white. The show jumped the shark when color came to be and Knott's career took of and Universal made him the star of some memorable comedies. When it went to color as was the practice in those days and the show was tired. We were tired too. Slim pickens in those days with only 3 networks who told us when and what we watched a far cry from what I think is a change for the better with Tivo and shows on demand via the web.

If you really are a collector then I suggest select the good old shows and include Griffith's ""A Face in the Crowd"" and ""No Time For Sergeants"".",1163980800,,1887,4.195592286501378
2645426,3,B000HWZ4IY,"I have been a fan of the show since the original broadcasts in the 1960's, but it is all too easy to see why this was the Final Season. This is easily the least season, too in every respect. To begin with, there was only one appearance by Don Knotts as Barney Fife. There was also very real fatigue present throughout most of the episodes, all too evident in most of Andy Griffith's half-hearted and lifeless performances. The show really dried up plain-and-simple, when Don Knotts left. The wonderful chemistry between Andy and Barney was gone. Not to mention that by this time several other popular characters had either left the show or were seldom seen, which further weakened the series. At its worst, the show probably was at least as good as any other comedy series of the late 1960's, but if you are a real devotee of the show, you know the series had already gone way past its prime by the Eighth and Final Season. I plan to buy this DVD set just to make my collection complete, but for me anyway, I already have the show at its very best.",1160697600,,1048,4.407216494845361
2645427,3,B000HWZ4IY,"Season 8 was the final season of the Andy Griffith Show.  The last episodes of this season introduced the character Sam Jones (Ken Berry) who would continue the Mayberry tradition in the series Mayberry RFD that would last three seasons and did well in the ratings until it and other rural-oriented shows were canceled.  Season 8 of TAGS was the only season the legendary sitcom was rated #1.  Perhaps it was known that this would be the final season, so folks tuned in knowing a good thing was about to end.  I like seasons six and seven and I think the color seasons are, for the most part, terribly underrated, but season 8 is my least favorite.  Reviewing the list of episodes, only ""Howard the Bowler,"" ""The Wedding,"" and ""Goober Goes to the Auto Show"" I consider to be above average. The rest are rather stale.  Don Knotts makes one appearance in the rather odd episode ""Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting.""  Here's what you get:

""Opie's First Love"": Opie's big date jilts him for another guy.

""Howard the Bowler"":  In a bowling match between Mayberry and Mt. Pilot, Howard is one strike away from a perfect game only to have the lights go out due to a power overload.  He has a day to think about it before he tries for the final strike.

""A Trip to Mexico"":  Aunt Bee wins a trip to Mexico and takes two of her friends.  She learns that one of the best ways to lose friends is to travel with them.

""Andy's Trip to Raleigh"":  Another Helen blow-up episode.  This time, Andy meets with a lawyer in Raleigh but doesn't let Helen know the minor detail of the lawyer being a hot female.

""Opie Steps Up in Class"": Opie becomes friends with a kid from a wealthy family and Andy and Aunt Bee fear they won't be able to measure up.

""Howard's Main Event"": Howard becomes friends with a girl who works at the bakery but is confronted by her ex-boyfriend (Allan Melvin).

""Aunt Bee the Juror"":  Jack Nicholson appears in this episode.  Aunt Bee serves on a jury and is the only one who believes Nicholson's character is not guilty.

""The Tape Recorder"":  Opie and Arnold tape record a conversation between a prisoner and his attorney and find out the location of stolen loot.  Andy refuses to listen to the tape because it goes against attorney/client confidentiality.

""Opie's Group"":  Opie is guitarist in a rock band and Clara warns them about the extravagance of making music the main part of one's life--and then joins the band.

""Aunt Bee and the Lecturer"":  Aunt Bee is creeped out when a lecturer falls for her because she reminds him of his departed wife.

""Andy's Investment"":  To help pay for Opie's college education, Andy moonlights as an owner of a laundromat and finds it may be more trouble than its worth.  Sensing the dilemma, Opie reconsiders his future plans.

""Howard and Millie"":  Howard proposes to Millie (rather sudden?) and, on the train ride to visit Millie's family, find many areas where they are not compatible.  You'd think Millie and Howard would've had more episodes together before this step, but I guess the series was moving things along quickly in their last season.

""Aunt Bee's Cousin"":  The episodes where relatives or old friends visit Aunt Bee are usually my least favorites, and this one is no exception.  Aunt Bee's cousin tries to get her involved in a business venture but turns out to be all talk.

""Suppose Andy Gets Sick"": Andy not having a deputy for the last two and  seasons was rather unrealistic and it shows in this episode.  Goober makes a mess of things when he fills in for an ailing Andy.

""Howard's New Life"":  A rather strange episode.  Howard decides to move to a Caribbean island, but soon realizes his pot of gold is back in Mayberry.

""Goober the Executive"":  Goober buys Wally's service station and worries he may not be cut out to be the boss.

""The Mayberry Chef"":  Aunt Bee stars in a cooking show and Opie and Andy find out it is much nicer eating Aunt Bee's cooking than watching it on television.

""Emmet's Brother-in-Law"":  Emmett's wife convinces him to join her brother's insurance agency, but his heart remains in his fix-it shop.

""Opie's Drugstore Job"":  At his new job at the drugstore, Opie accidentally breaks an expensive bottle of perfume and decides to buy one to replace it before his boss can find out.

""The Church Benefactors"":  The church committee is torn between spending its funds on repairing the church building or buying new choir robes.

""Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting"":  Mayberry takes on the Cold War.  This episode, to me, is way over-the-top.  Barney arranges for a meeting between Russian and American diplomats to take place in Mayberry, which turns out to be Andy's kitchen (another kitchen debate?).

""Goober Goes to an Auto Show"":  Goober meets up with an old friend who appears to be a big success, so Goober is loose with his money so as to appear a big shot and goes in over his head.  Later, Goober has the chance to get revenge, but demonstrates he is a success in ways other than money.

Aunt Bee's Big Moment"":  Feeling like she has not accomplished much in her life, Aunt Bee takes flying lessons and prepares for her solo.

""Helen's Past"":  Andy finds a newspaper clipping showing Helen being arrested and decides to investigate further.  When a busybody from the school board finds out, she decides Miss Crump may not be appropriate teacher material.

""Emmett's Anniversary"":  Emmett considers buying his wife a fur coat for their anniversary.  He decides it is out of his means, but his wife learns about his plans.

""The Wedding"":  Howard's mother finally remarries and he fixes up his house to be a swinging bachelor pad (he sure forgot about Millie fast).  The parties he puts on are very square until Emmett shows up.

""Sam for Town Council"":  Enter Sam Jones, a respected farmer who Andy urges to run for town council (funny, we never heard of him before until now).  His opponent is Emmett.

""Opie and Mike"":  A bully threatens Sam's son, Mike.  Opie becomes Mike's protector and Mike becomes overly dependent on Opie's friendship and is hurt when Opie's attentions turn to a new girl in town.  There is a reference to the slightly controversial episode ""Opie and the Bully."" Sam Jones doesn't go along with Andy's idea of letting his son confront the bully.

""A Girl for Goober"":  A lady psychologist uses a computer match-making questionnaire for research purposes and is hooked up with Goober (they both read a lot; well, Goober reads lots of comic books anyway).

""Mayberry RFD"":  The characters in the next Mayberry series are introduced as Sam takes in an Italian family.  Rather stereotypical, but that's how television was back then.",1158969600,,6659,4.69844020797227
2645438,3,B000HWZ4IY,"To this point I've reviewed all seven seasons of TAGS, my all-time favorite show.  This is the first season I've given less than at least four stars.  My reasons? Simply that in my opinion this was the weakest season of the series.  Andy Griffith had basically been 'bribed' to come back for an eighth season, and in the last five or so episodes it was clear the show was being groomed for Ken Berry and the 'Mayberry RFD' years.  Still, there are a few hidden gems in there, including:

Episode 221: 'Goober, The Executive'.  Goober buys the filling station from Wally, and is soon gulping down aspirin like M&M's while trying to figure how to keep the place afloat.

Episode 224: 'Howard, The Bowler'.  Howard is one ball away from a perfect game after a power outage cuts off his hot streak.

Episode 232: 'Suppose Andy Gets Sick'.  Andy catches a touch of the flu, leaving Goober in charge of local law enforcement, with predictable results.  (NOTE: Hey, isn't that 'Asa' the former bank security guard playing the town doctor? Man, that Asa is sure 'multi-talented')

Episode 235: 'Howard's New Life'.  Howard chunks it all for the island life, but finds the end of his rainbow lies in good ol' Mayberry after all.  The ending of this episode is truly one of the best the color years has to offer.

Episode 240: ""Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting'. Big Barn's last appearance.  Just listen to him butcher the Russian representative's name as only 'Fast Gun Fife' could.  Don Knotts won his fifth emmy award from this episode.

Definitely the weakest the show had to offer was season eight, though as I've said before, even the 'worst' of TAGS beats the majority of today's TV 'best'.

I truly hope Paramount follows this up with the 1986 movie 'Return to Mayberry', thus finishing off my collectin of TAGS in style.",1157414400,,1816,4.6719242902208205

8141747,4,B000HWZ4IY,"I'll go along with most viewers and say that the first 5 seasons with Don Knotts (black and white) were the best, while the last three color seasons were weaker in comparison.  Andy went through three distinct personalities throughout the show's run.  In season 1, he was a goofball, almost embarrassingly country, while Don Knotts was a little more serious.  Seasons 2 through 5 (the best in my opinion) had Andy being more serious and responsible, yet very warm and compassionate, while Don Knotts was sometimes a real pain in the a$$.  To me, seasons 2 through 5 were the cream of the crop.

Then we get to the color episodes, seasons 6 through 8.  Don Knotts left the series (except for a few cameos), the producer and the writers changed, and the show's emphasis went from being a warm hearted character based comedy to that of mundane small town humor.  Andy went from being warm and compassionate with a sense of humor to just being irritable and distant.  Helen Crump became thin skinned and bitchy, always indignant with Andy for just about anything.  Goober, Emmett, and Howard were just plain annoying and dorky.  The mood music in the black and white episodes was rich and moving, whereas in the color seasons, it was sparse and empty sounding  And then there was the color film itself.  While the black and white film made it easier to imagine reminiscing about days gone by that I've never experienced but would have liked to, the color film broke the spell and made everything look...too real.  The bottom line is that the last three seasons lacked the warmth and charm of the first five.

I must admit, however, that season 8 had some pretty interesting episodes, especially the one where Howard Sprague moves to the Caribbean, and the one where Aunt Bee learns to fly.  And the last three episodes were basically the pilot and setup for Mayberry RFD.  The print and sound quality is excellent and the episodes are shown in full without commercial breaks.  Overall this is a safe show for the whole family and one that I recommend, although as I've said before, seasons 6 through 8 are weaker in comparison to the first five.",1489190400,,2141,4.681818181818182
