7987482,5,B00008WJB2,"When I watched Arthur at the first time was love at the first sight!, and now my daugthers (5 and 2) love him too. This DVD is just perfect because it talks about Buster leaving Elmwood City and how hard is that for him and for Arthur, and we just had a big move. Kids can learn a lot about dealing with their own problems with the show. Also has a story about DW and a deer she wants to take home. You are going to love as much as we do.",1140048000,5,438,3.7717391304347827
