5410292,5,B00AEB97G8,"Awesome stuff,Ryan shows you the correct way to catch someone and not let them out with a submission as the answer to the opponents defensive transitions",1395187200,,153,4.923076923076923
5410293,5,B00AEB97G8,This arm triangles DVD set is my favorite of all the ones I own. Being a top player I really like some of the lessons in these DVDs. I was exposed to a lot of submissions and techniques that I wasn't very familiar with. Ryan Hall's an excellent teacher and these are well worth the price!,1391644800,,288,4.160714285714286
5410294,2,B00AEB97G8,"In my opinion, I do not have a respect for the instructor as a person. His teaching of the technique is good, not great (see Rener or Ryron for great instruction), but good. Ryan talks a lot about high level black belts. Dude I got it you are world champion, stop beating your chest and be a little humble. Just tell me the details about the technique not about the difference between blue belts sparing and how horrible they are. Or the football analogy. I guess I'm just a little disappointed that Ryan's not as humble as most other BJJ practitioners I've been exposed to in seminars or DVDs.

Techniques taught are great. Instructor's delivery is good, I've seen better. Instructor's attitude and language is 0-stars, hence the rating.

And come on, stop with the profanity. I would hope he'd be kicked out of most dojos.",1391040000,4,824,4.636986301369863
5410295,3,B00AEB97G8,"I have to compare this to several other Jiu Jitsu Series & DVDs I own. Gracie Combatives, Eddie Bravo, Roy Dean entire series, Carvalho entire extensive series, Demian Maia Science of Jiu jitsu 1 & 2, Machado's Great Escapes, D. Morales Counters.

The benefit of Ryan Hall are the following:
1) He is a native English speaker, sounds like something small but in a lot of other series you see the guy struggling to find words to describe the message he is trying to convay, and many times the quality of teaching suffers because of this.

2) He is perhaps the best technique teacher.  You can learn the technique so well from him that its better than an in-class session. This is very tough to pull off.  On other dvd series when a technique is taught you struggle and wonder ""How come I can't get this guy chocked out?"" You have to go to your class and have your teacher explain the finer points that the dvd did not teach.  Not so with Ryan Hall, he teaches the finer points and does so extremely well. The only dvd series that gives him competition in this area is the Gracie Combative series, with the Gracie's being slightly better at explanation than Ryan Hall, and Demian Maia coming in a close 3rd place.  He embarrasses the rest of them in this area though, he's that good.

3) He has excellent transition teaching- #1 in this area.  He predicts for you what the combatant will do when you apply the move and teaches you how to transition with the opponent so that they still end up in a trap and you win.  Here he is better than any other dvd series I've seen. The only one who might come close to his level of explanation at the transitions is Eddie Bravo.  What he definitely has better than Eddie Bravo though is his ability to teach the technique and its finer points.  For example, I watched Eddie's ""arm crush"" and still can't do it, no one in my class knows how, and when I apply it I must be doing something wrong cause no submission occurs.  Again, Eddie only worries about explaining the transitions into these different moves and he lacks detailed explanation of the technique and this is the cause of my failure to apply his moves despite spending $100 on his dvd.  This would NEVER happen with Ryan hall because the technique is taught so well.

Now the negative.  I took away 2 stars because of foul language.  No other dvd series I have has this, except Eddie Bravo but at least Eddie has the decency to put ""Explicit Content"" and ""Parental Warning"" on his DVD cover.  Ryan hall drops too many F-bombs and S-bombs for no reason what so ever. He curses much more than Eddie Bravo, though Eddie Bravo has a comical character that does interludes that curses very much during these comic relief episodes, Eddie himself curses only a couple times in his series. Ryan Hall puts Eddie's comic relief dude to shame, I'm exaggerating a bit but you get the point. He looks rather professional but then these vulgar words come out and destroy the mood and flow of the series. You have to wonder why?  It can't be that he actually teaches like this in real life? Does he?  So I play the DVD to explain a move for my 7, 9, and 11 yo kids and I hadn't realized just how bad it was until they kept looking up at me awkwardly whenever Ryan let one fly out of his mouth.  Terrible and pointless.  Please be more professional in the future. Some of us in this country are still trying to raise our children with some morals, respect, and values, and those of us trying to do this for our kids are likely the very ones willing to spend the money on your dvds to teach them..... so we make up a huge chunk of your very target audience. You get nothing out of this ridiculous vulgar nonsense.  In this, the other DVDs definitely have him beat, because all the other gentleman are extremely professional throughout their entire dvds series. It leaves you wondering where is Ryan Hall's integrity? I won't return the dvd due to the quality of the teaching, from now on I'll have to watch it alone and then teach my kids (though I'd rather just learn it together). I can see how the other reviewer who wanted his money back could return this since it doesn't have an ""explicit content"" warning.",1385596800,12,4195,4.427828348504551
5410296,5,B00AEB97G8,Should have bought this a long time ago. Ryan Hall breaks everything down. Definitely worth every penny. I own 3 of his instructional a now.,1376784000,2,140,4.64
5410297,5,B00AEB97G8,"After watching most of this set, I felt it was time to apply some of the concepts in class. I'll just say I landed two kata gatame's and a brabo in one night! This dvd really opened my eyes to attacking with arm triangles. Highly recommended for anyone serious about bjj!",1366243200,2,271,4.333333333333333
5410298,1,B00AEB97G8,"I bought this dvd series for my 12 year old son who started taking jiu jitsu last summer. He was very excited to get the dvd's and learn something new.

However, the graphic and loose profanity was intolerable. The F Word and other profanity is used more than once in the first dvd. We don't use that foul language in my home and I don't want to expose my son to it and to keep the dvd's which would weaken the standard I've set in my home.

The profanity is totally unnecessary and shows a huge lack of professionalism and respect for the diverse audience who may watch these dvd's.

I'm working with Amazon now to return the dvd's which are in excellent condition and only the first was actually half way watched. World Martial Arts has refused to honor our return even though I fully explained the reason why.  The dvd's should have come with a rating or language warning.",1365379200,10,875,4.416149068322981
5410299,5,B00AEB97G8,This is some of the best instruction I've seen on video.  I have been training for a long time and the focus on theory and concepts in addition to the physical demonstration is very important and these videos are as good as it gets. I will be picking up other dvds in Ryan Hall's series.,1364774400,5,287,4.218181818181818
5410300,5,B00AEB97G8,"This dvd is excellent!  Techniques are discussed in details. A lot of useful information.
The dvd was received in a reasonable amount of time in perfect conditions.",1361750400,4,164,5.074074074074074
5410301,5,B00AEB97G8,"I received this dvd set as an early Christmas present and I couldn't be happier with it.  Arm triangles have always been a favored submission of mine, but Ryan Hall takes it to the next level, providing a wealth of information not only on finishes and submission combinations, but most importantly, positioning.  I have already improved my choking game and I haven't finished watching the entire set yet.  Hall articulates his theory and explanation better than anyone else I've been exposed to.  If you care at all about shoulder chokes, sleeve chokes, guillotines, and top game positioning, then this set will provide great value.",1356307200,7,632,5.048076923076923
8550358,5,B00AEB97G8,"I now have 5 of Ryan Halls instructionals, and I can't recommend them enough. The clarity of explanation, the focus on concept and heuristics rather than rite technique and his ability to connect principle to multiple applications makes for unparalleled bjj instruction.

Seriously, watching just the section in the mechanics of arm triangles immediately saw a jump in the number of chokes I finished....and thats just a few minutes out of the hours of instruction in this set.

Buy it now.",1517702400,,490,5.037037037037037

8550367,5,B00AEB97G8,Great concepts and theory on setting up and properly finishing the arm triangle!  This teaches you how to set up and finish the arm triangle even if you are a smaller guy- In other words you don't have to choke the guy with massive arm muscles to make this submission effective!  Check it out!,1406678400,,293,4.407407407407407
