7994372,4,B00009YP7P,Bought this years ago. Interesting to see what different weapon types can achieve. Has since been superseded by you tube and internet.,1463184000,,134,5.136363636363637
7994373,4,B00009YP7P,"This is an old tape that explores & demonstrates a wide range of pistol cartridges.  It has some classic footage like the segment with Richard Davis of ""Second Chance"" fame.  To get the word out of his product ""kevlar vets for cops"" he would go to various places and shoot himself in the chest with a .44 mag while wearing his vest....crazy!?!?!

I'm retired after 33 years in law enforcement....used this tape years ago in some of my classes.  A lot of the info is still relevant...",1363910400,,483,4.517241379310345
7994374,5,B00009YP7P,"I own this on DVD.  Yes, these this and some other Anite Productions are available on DVD.  The video is not only informative but fun to watch.  There's an incredible part where Alexander Jason and Richard Davis actually show the effectiveness of body armor by allowing the other to shoot them in the chest while they are wearing it.  Alexander disproves plenty of Hollywood myths.  It is outdated however.  Alexander shows that when a suppressor is attached to a semiauto pistol, said pistol loses the power to cycle it's slide.  Nowadays that is no longer true, with the advent of better suppressors.
Anyway, it's a great video, and if you want to learn the capabilities of certain firearms and ammunition this is a must own.",1283299200,,727,4.768
7994375,5,B00009YP7P,I hope Mr. Jason makes more of his award winning videos. Deadly Weapons flushes Hollywood myths right down the tube. Anyone who wants to shoot should see this.,1228694400,,159,4.714285714285714
7994376,5,B00009YP7P,"There is not a more accurate video available showing the capabilities, and inaccurate myths about Class III weapons.  Hollywood has a way of blowing the capabilities of the weapons way out in left field.  The narator of this film puts it all back into reality in a documentary style that is exciting and informative.  He risks his life to proove that a .308 hitting body armor will not knock a person down, as he takes a shot at less than three feet point blank!  A very good study for law enforcement to show reality as opposed to hollywood.  A must see for any firearms enthusiast!",1083369600,6,583,4.514285714285714
7994377,5,B00009YP7P,"I'm a law enforcement officer with a major deptartment. I first saw this video years ago during academy training and I still watch it now and then. I learn something new everytime. There is a famous scene where a guy gets shot with a rifle while standing on one foot (he's wearing a bullet-proof vest) to show that a bullet can't knock a person down. I think everyone in law enforcement has seen that! The strange thing about this video is that it is really entertaining and informative. We still use it in the academy. It's great.
There are at least two others made by the same people: Deadly Effects and Deadly Force. We've got all of them and they're all good.",1058572800,7,663,4.442622950819672
