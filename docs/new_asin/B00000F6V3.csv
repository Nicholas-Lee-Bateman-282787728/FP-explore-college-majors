But a woman's voice on a radio wave keeps the love of liberty afloat. Maya's fading pirate broadcasts finally reach the pirate of her dreams. Her young Captain Harlock sets a swashbuckling course for walk-the-plank space-age adventure. In an uncertain future he finds his past, a trusty old ship and new crew. Together they defy a double threat: the mighty Umedas Fleet and deadly River Of Flame. Captain Harlock's buccaneer spirit comes to re-inspire Earth...and all occupied planets throughout the Sea of Stars.""",1473465600,,669,5.4423076923076925
