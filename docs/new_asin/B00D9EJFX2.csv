5784203,4,B00D9EJFX2,"This is a step above your normal teenage slasher/revenge killing movie. It was actually quite good. I first liked the fact that the characters are of all different backgrounds and body-types rather than the usual Barbie blondes and jocks (though there is an obligatory shower seen complete with boobs which made my husband happy) that seem to permeate these types of movies. They were believable as high school kids. The group of friends seem like an unlikely sort but there are some actually nicely developed characters and dynamics between them (I especially like the interplay between the student council president and the homecoming queen before she was crowned). The killing scenes aren't too over-the-top, also. The best part is the surprising identity of the killer, whose complete flippancy and rationale for the crimes is a nice touch at the end. There are enough things about this to keep it from being a stock prom/homecoming slasher flick. We rented this as something to fall asleep to, but ended up watching it until the end.",1380067200,,1038,5.005780346820809
5784204,4,B00D9EJFX2,"Let's admit one thing going into this review. There's really nowhere new to go when it comes to the slasher genre. Anything you can think of has been done before. All we can hope for now is that the person making a new entry into the genre is skilled or dedicated enough to come up with something utilizing all the clichs we've all seen before but in a different way. I try to keep all this in mind whenever I receive the latest slice-and-dice film in the mail.

""Bloody Homecoming"" from Image Entertainment is the latest slasher film I was sent for review. All I could think about when gazing on the cover was, ""Here's someone trying to do 'Prom Night' again."" The cover featuring a girl in a homecoming dress holding a bloody tiara did bring a smile to my face and I found myself nostalgically looking forward to watching the movie.

A high school prank leaves the star football player locked in a closet of a building that catches on fire. Three years after his death at the Homecoming event, the students responsible for the tragic joke receive letters written in blood in their lockers. The appearance of the notes coincide with the first homecoming dance since the accident. One by one, the students are picked off by a killer dressed in a fireman's suit wielding a spirit baton whittled down on one end into a spear.

""Bloody Homecoming"" is not a good movie if what you're expecting is Oscar-worthy performances and an emotionally gripping story that will leave audiences in tears. What we do get is a rather effective homage to the great slasher films of the 1980s. It's the sort of movie that leaves you smiling because all the right ingredients are in place and they're working.

Some of the success at being entertaining comes from the fact that the cast is a bunch of unknowns who we know aren't being exploited for what they've been in before. This isn't ""Prom Night"" starring the latest greatest cast members from hit teen TV shows like ""Pretty Little Liars,"" ""DeGrassi,"" and ""Switched at Birth"" in an attempt for a quick cash grab. Director Brian C. Weed made a slasher film for the love of the genre. The cast is in it to have fun and you can see that onscreen.

I was also impressed by the kill scenes. The special effects and makeup are really good for an independent film. My hats off to whoever was in charge of those departments. It's not easy to deliver convincing gore, decapitations, and impalements on a shoestring budget.

Being a slasher film, there has to be at least one topless scene and some sexual content and talk. It wouldn't be a proper tribute to the genre movies of the 1980s without those elements, right? I don't watch these types of films for that. I enjoy the gore and little twitches of fright they provide.

If you're looking for a sincere and fun slasher flick that doesn't reek of Hollywood payola, ""Bloody Homecoming"" is a good choice. It has all the great elements of the 1980s genre movies it's mimicking, but doesn't come off as tired. However, you can't take the good without the bad. The acting will leave you cringing at times. Who really watches these types of movies for the acting anyway?",1380067200,6,3143,4.581850533807829
5784205,1,B00D9EJFX2,"I really wanted to like this one.  The idea of a contemporary update on the classic slasher pic is cool and this one has many of the classic elements:  a prank that ends in someone's violent death; the students involved with the incident being targeted by a killer when the movie jumps 3 years later; the new murders occurring as the first homecoming dance since the original tragic event is being held; a couple of creepy red-herring characters including, inevitably, a spooky janitor.  Unfortunately everything about this movie is bad.  The dialogue is awful.  The acting is lousy.  The characters are annoying as hell except when they shut up because they're about to be murdered.  The gore scenes are ridiculously unimaginative and not particularly gory.  The cutest actress in the movie by far is also the first to be killed--which shows pretty lousy judgment on the part of the filmmakers.  Unless you are a slasher movie completest don't waste your time.",1387584000,3,961,4.919254658385094
5784206,3,B00D9EJFX2,This movie is an overall predictable flick with a couple good parts. Most of the film comprises cliche killer chasing scenes the plot was alright but if your into this kind of flick be my guest,1386028800,,193,4.388888888888889
5784207,3,B00D9EJFX2,"Slasher films often get knocked for lack of originality which is unfair since just about every film genre has its own formula.  The classic ""mystery killer"" slasher formula has a young attractive cast, a dash of skin, some good leap outs, the virtuous & elusive final girl, and the ""great reveal"" at the end.  Pretty simple eh?  Yet it's amazing how many remakes of 80's slasher films manage to screw it up (e.g. Prom Night (2008)) by going off-formula.  Bloody Homecoming with a cast of young actors and small budget gets it right for the most part.  BH is a well-executed slasher that hits every mark.  Some slashers have such unlikeable characters, one almost roots for the killer.  Not so with BH. Kudos to the writer.  The fireman suit worn by the killer was a simple and effective disguise.  You won't guess who's behind the mask.  If you liked Prom Night (1980 not 2008), you'll enjoy Bloody Homecoming.",1383955200,,910,4.7025316455696204
5784208,4,B00D9EJFX2,"Decent new slasher with an iconic killer. Not completely memorable, but pretty good for a rental. Give it a go around.",1383523200,,118,4.666666666666667
5784209,3,B00D9EJFX2,"Billy Corbin(Jesse Ferraro) dies in a tragic accident after failing to score with Annie (Grainne McDermott). The accident was in part of his own doing, but of course our 80's slasher style film blames everyone who was there. This is a who-dun-it with the killer being dressed in a fireman's suit killing students with a spirit stick. The suspects are introduced after the first killing. The film drops weak clues, and even at the end when we know who it is, a student asks, ""Why are you doing this? I don't understand."" I felt the same way.

The plus side of the film is the proverbial creepy janitor (Jim Tavar). The theme of the film is the subject taught in the classroom, in this case ""Oroonoko"" that is, class structured society. Much of the support acting was sad, especially the principal (Steve Earnest).

This is a run of the mill slasher throw back. Might be worth an inexpensive rental.

5784210,4,B00D9EJFX2,"Bloody Homecoming is a smart horror film that is well paced. It starts off with a guy trying to get into a girls pants but she rejects him and locks him in a room. A candle is burning, it falls, the rooms catches on fire, & he dies on homecoming. The high school goes three years without a homecoming but finally decide to have one. The victim skips out on the events and is the first victim to die. After this the film takes time to explain what is going on and gives a few suspects on who the killer is. Homecoming night someone in a firemen outfit slaughter the kids one by one. The ending to me was a shocker as I thought it would have been someone else. I didn't like how the killer died and the tacky ending.

Overall, a must see slasher. I like how they took time to flesh out the story and present a few suspects as who the killer is. The ending was weak but didn't take away from film.",1381795200,,894,4.0508474576271185

Thanks to the reviewers, I took a chance on it & wow, wee, wow, hold on to your hats....this roller coaster whips you 'round each bend, an E-Ticket attraction...only stop: Goreville. Deeply disturbing images that caused an internal argument (look, don't look, no look, hurry look away) several times throughout.

8590907,2,B00D9EJFX2,"I love slasher flicks.  However, this lame attempt to copy those old classics falls far short of the mark, primarily because it tries too hard to replicate the formula.  It is a by-the-numbers facsimile with stock characters, bad acting, and routine killings.  It suffers from familiarity and a very slow-slow-slow start before anything of interest happens.  The filmmakers don't even try to inject an ounce of originality into their effort.  Even their suspect list is on the short side (a suspicious janitor, a sheriff who appears in just one scene, and a character that's named but never appears in the movie).  The plot involves an accidental death of a would-be rapist.  The killer inexplicably waits three years before exacting their revenge.  The twist ending is justified on the spot by a closing rant and found wanting.  It makes about as much sense as an elephant showing up at the homecoming dance because it thought the circus was in town.

A huge disappointment.",1435104000,2,975,4.962962962962963
8590908,4,B00D9EJFX2,"When a group of friends get denied access to their Freshmen homecoming by a group of older students, they decide to throw their own party. However, when the football star, of the group, Billy, tries to attack one of the girls, the friends lock him up in a closet where is he accidentally killed in a fire. Three years later after two banned Homecomings, the friends are now seniors and the return of Homecoming has arrived. But someone is trying to crash the celebration. The friends receive threatening messages in their lockers believing its sick joke. But on Homecoming night, the friends find themselves being stalked and slayed by someone wearing a firemans outfit. Is Billy back for revenge? And who will survive this Bloody Homecoming?

Bloody Homecoming is a very fun 80s style slasher that many slasher fans (myself included) has desired. This is the film the Prom Night remake should have been. We are given a group of characters that are very funny and likable. Especially Jaclyn played by Randi Lamey, Jaclyn is the one with the sharp tongue and not afraid to step up to the plate. We are also given Wade, the lovable and funny gay character played by Branden Lee Roth. And although he is not one of the leads, we get a few comical moments from Janitor Fred played by Jim Tavare. Finally, we have our Final Girl, Loren, played by Lexi Giovagnoli. Shes the kind-hearted character whos the friend to everyone. While Loren is very likable, shes really not given much to do when it comes to the final act. Along with our likable cast, we have some very nice kills and plenty of blood. To top it all off we have a couple of good chase scenes (lets face it, many slashers severely lack them these days). Bloody Homecoming resembles some classic 80s slasher films like Prom Night, Happy Birthday to Me, House on Sorority Row, and My Bloody Valentine. We have the over-the-top acting, gnarly kills, the back for revenge subplot, and a very hysterical final act when the killer is revealed.

If you miss what a true slasher really is that is all about fun rather than just gore, Bloody Homecoming is highly recommended.

8590909,3,B00D9EJFX2,"I found Bloody Homecoming to be a fun, 80s throwback slasher with most of the right stuff. Granted it wasn't great but it was good enough to satisfy the retro slasher lover in me.

The kills were better than average for this type of indie film and the effects were very passable some even quite good. The story is quite formulaic, in a good, familiar way. Years earlier someone is wronged during Homecoming then flash to the present and it's Homecoming again but this time someone is dressing in a firefighter suit and killing the students they deem responsible.

The movie was nicely paced and the acting was good enough not to turn you off. The killer was someone I never suspected and I enjoyed the finale.",1423353600,,709,4.574803149606299
