2075692,4,B0002BSHWU,"My 2-year-old son starts clapping and dancing frantically when the catchy ""Can you Name 20 Trucks"" theme song comes on. He is mesmerized by the trucks, and can watch this DVD over and over again.

We just ordered our second copy of the DVD - the first copy got scratched - and I am buying his friend one for his birthday!",1125014400,12,321,4.262295081967213
2075693,5,B0002BSHWU,"There are two kinds of children's videos: those that are fun for young and old, and those that are insipid for anyone with a double-digit age.  Twenty trucks is definitely fun for all, though I'm not sure which is better - watching the video or watching the reaction of my toddler.  Maybe you'll even learn a thing or two -- ever hear of a grapple truck before?  Although the picture quality varies widely from segment to segment, it does not get in the way of the fun.  And the theme song is very cute.  If you would like to preview the video, go to [...]",1118880000,28,556,4.257142857142857
2075694,4,B0002BSHWU,My child absolutely loves this dvd.  He is very fascinated with all of the different trucks.  This is highly recommended for all the little boys.,1109548800,7,145,4.76
2075695,5,B0002BSHWU,"This DVD is both entertaining AND instructional for young kids (about 2-6 yrs. old).  Though the video quality varies quite a bit from segment to segment, the DVD shows kids real trucks in real action and does NOT divert kids' attention from the trucks wth elaborate story lines or extraneous characters.

The videos, songs, and narrations in the DVD focus on the twnety trucks, helping kids learn and satisfying their curiosity.  This is a great DVD for kids, especially for kids enthralled by trucks.",1097884800,15,502,4.9523809523809526
2075696,4,B0002BSHWU,"This is a fun video for young kids who like trucks.  My three year old loves to shout along with the kids' voices numbering and naming the twenty trucks.  My older boys (9 and 11) thought the footage of the trucks was ""cool"".  But they found the narration a little boring.  I would recommend this video for younger kids, maybe from 2-5.  For older kids, maybe try the Real Wheels series.",1097280000,,387,4.394366197183099
2075697,4,B0002BSHWU,"At first I didn't like the video very much because it was fairly poor quality.  However, my four year old son loves it!  And, it is a fun way to see all the trucks he loves in action.",1097020800,3,183,3.789473684210526
2075698,3,B0002BSHWU,"Well, it does have 20 trucks, and gets right to the point. There's no extraneous shots of non-truck things while your toddler is anxiously awaiting the good parts. Each truck gets a few minutes of solo coverage at a time.

On the down side, the narration is comically bland. The video quality ranges from OK to very poor. It's all trucks - no excavators or front-loaders. The scene selection menu is a case study in misguided UI.",1093996800,9,429,4.571428571428571
2075699,5,B0002BSHWU,"I have two sons (2 years old and 4 years old) that love this DVD.  These boys are fascinated by each truck segment in the DVD and ask to watch it over and over.  It's fun to see them calling out the name of each truck; they are especially fond of the monster truck segment.
I heard this company was also coming out with 20 More Trucks and 20 Trains.  I'm sure my kids will love those too.  I highly recommend this to parents with curious kids.",1088467200,,443,4.057471264367816
2075700,3,B0002BSHWU,"These are not the songs from Youtube.  We have the ""Truck Tunes"" and thought this would be similar but it isn't.  It's just informational facts about 20 trucks and video footage of them working.  My 2 year old likes it but we were kind of disappointed.",1399593600,,252,4.434782608695652
2075701,2,B0002BSHWU,"My grandkids have watched TwentyTrucks on You Tube many, many times; so I bought the dvd; the trucks on the dvd are ""normal"" trucks; not the huge earth movers and dump trucks. The DVD has a regular 18 wheeler, a camper, a monster truck; ect. Not the same as you tube.",1390867200,,267,4.254901960784314
2075702,1,B0002BSHWU,"Very disappointed in this dvd.  Very boring for a child to watch.  I thought it would be more music based like what is on youtube but you apparently have to order the ""ultimate trucks"" package to get those videos.",1373932800,,213,4.435897435897436
2075703,4,B0002BSHWU,"The DVD was recommended by a friend. My 2 1/2 year old grandson just loves it.
Every time I babysit he marches upstairs and wants to watch it.",1373846400,,142,4.107142857142857
2075704,5,B0002BSHWU,One of the few things that my grandsons will watch.  They love all the trucks and the music is fun too.,1372464000,,103,3.9047619047619047
2075705,4,B0002BSHWU,"My grandson has been watching glimpes of Twenty Trucks for the past couple years and now happy to have the full DVD.
He loves trucks and this DVD has get all of his attention.",1369353600,,175,4.176470588235294
2075706,5,B0002BSHWU,"I hate sticking my 2 year old in front of the tv but these movies are great, he learns a lot, and will sit there for the whole 40 minutes. Absolutely necessary when I need to get stuff done :)",1365120000,,192,3.825
2075707,5,B0002BSHWU,My 1.5 year old watches this several times a week.  Loves it. The music is quite catchy!!! I would send it to any little one that loves trucks!,1362960000,,143,4.107142857142857
2075708,5,B0002BSHWU,"I don't write reviews very often but I have to give credit to this video. It is awesome. The other reviews are correct in that the production is ""low budget"" and not fancy BUT who cares?! My 22 month old son loves this video! He loves trucks, cars and construction vehicles with a passion. This video holds his attention and he likes it more than most of the other truck videos on the market. It has a cute song and good, simple footage of trucks in action.",1350691200,,457,4.264367816091954
2075709,5,B0002BSHWU,"My son is 3, and for his 3rd birthday we ordered Twenty Trucks & Truck Tunes. He is in love with them both, and knows all the words to the songs, and looks forward to seeing his favourite trucks in the video. Such a great set!",1348185600,,226,3.9347826086956523
2075710,3,B0002BSHWU,"I checked out the Twenty Trucks dvd for my son from the library and he loved it. It was narrated by a male voice, talking normally and in an almost soothing tone. We then got a copy from amazon which appears to be re-done. The new re-done version has a different narration that grates on me. However, this video is still mostly brilliant at giving young boys what they want -- trucks. My 2 yo son just does not get sick of this DVD.",1294012800,3,432,4.154761904761905
2075711,5,B0002BSHWU,"This is a great video! My 22 month old son is obsessed with trucks and construction equipment. He knew a lot of the trucks already, but has learned some new ones (Bucket Truck! Monster Truck!) The camera work is a little shaky and blurry during some scenes but that's an adult's complaint, the target audience for this video couldn't care less. It's clearly spoken and not dumbed down or cartoony which is something I appreciate. It's great, fun and gives a lot of information about the trucks so it's educational. Definitely worth adding to your truck lover's collection!",1274140800,,572,4.846938775510204
2075712,2,B0002BSHWU,"This is an OK DVD that explains a lot about American trucks, but it's not as interesting to my son (or me) as the Truck Songs DVD by Hammershark Media.

There are some nice scenes of highway trucks on western interstates, and some interesting shots of vehicles at work, but the narration is just not interesting.

The narration is by a woman and a girl with quiz questions and answers, and it just didn't appeal to my son.  He asked me several times why they aren't singing.

This was purchased after we already had the Truck Songs DVD, so we had expectations that made this less interesting to us I suppose.  (That DVD is outstanding!)

The vocabulary is probably right for second-graders, but the more likely audience seems to be younger kids.  I may be all wrong about that, but this is my review.

Trucks covered include highway tractor-trailer rigs, fire truck, ambulance, tow truck, automobile transporter, garbage truck, pickup truck, dump truck, vacuum truck, cherry picker bucket truck, crane truck, water truck, ambulance, and more that I don't remember.

The scene of the vaccum truck using a remote control boom with vacuum to pick up roadside litter is funny to watch (for me, not my son) because in the time the two operators take to attempt to pick up a lot of roadside garbage, they could have just picked it up and put it in a plastic sack.  They try and try to get the vacuum nozzel over the garbage so that it will be sucked up in the tube, but it doesn't seem to work out.  My son was bored with this.

We may end up donating this DVD to the library while it's still pretty new.",1260835200,,1598,4.491349480968858
2075713,5,B0002BSHWU,My son told me that my grandsons just cannot get enough of this DVD.  They have watched it traveling in their car and at home.  I am so glad they are enjoying it!,1245024000,,162,3.878787878787879
2075714,5,B0002BSHWU,"I brought this as an early gift on a visit 2 days before Christmas, and after a whirlwind greeting from my 3 grandsons, 2, 41/2, and 7, they immediately settled down in front of this CD and their attention stayed focused almost all the way through it. Amazing considering the circumstances (lots of preholiday windup). Big hit!",1231632000,,327,4.754385964912281
2075715,5,B0002BSHWU,Great DVD.  The song at beginning and end is the highlight.  Even helped them learn to count to 20.,1229212800,,99,4.157894736842105
2075716,5,B0002BSHWU,"One of my son's favorite DVD's. He is 2 now, we got it when he was 1,5. He will sit there for the whole thing, so I can cook dinner or catch up on my chores. He can also count to ten by himself now and I think the DVD helped a lot because they count trucks and after watching it 500 times or more :) he started counting himself.",1214006400,,328,3.7
2075717,5,B0002BSHWU,"We've been borrowing this from the library for weeks now.  Time to get our own copy!  My 2 year old son shouts out the names of trucks whenever we drive anywhere.  He has learned a ton of vocabulary from this dvd--I was very surprised to hear him tell me all about the ""grapple"" on his crane truck.  Yes, you will get the song stuck in your head, but it's not nearly as annoying as some others out there.",1201651200,,404,4.141025641025641
2075718,1,B0002BSHWU,"This video would be a good intro for very young kids who are interested in trucks, but if you have a young child who already knows and loves trucks like excavators, wheel loaders, demolition trucks, feller bunchers, jackhammer trucks, bulldozers, mini-loaders, and the like, I would not buy this one.  There are only about two trucks that were interesting for my three year old who loves trucks - the vacuum truck and monster truck.  Out of the twenty, there are some really boring ones - even a bus and a pickup truck!  If your little one is into construction trucks this will be a huge disappointment.",1197417600,2,603,4.669811320754717
2075719,5,B0002BSHWU,"My son loves this DVD. He would watch it every day (or more) if we would let him. We tried other DVDs and most were really hooky. This one isn't. Although the cinematography isn't professional, that only bothers some reviewers. My son could care less. He is fascinated! We love driving down the street and naming all the trucks we learned in the video. My son is 2 now and has been watching this video for at least 6 months. He asks for it by name. I just bought 4 more copies for his friends.",1184630400,3,493,4.2
2075720,4,B0002BSHWU,"Ok - my two year old LOVES this, so it should probably get 5 stars. He wants to watch it ALL the time. He'd probably have it on a continuous loop if he could.

I don't mind the ""home brew"" quality of this dvd - it's actually part of the charm - but the narration could seriously drive you over the edge. The script is weak and voiceover actors obviously went to the same school of acting as the kids on Barney. The syrupy voices exclaiming, ""You're so smart!"" or ""That's as high as a pro-basketball hoop!"" could drive any parent over the edge.",1181088000,2,543,4.221153846153846
2075721,1,B0002BSHWU,"Worthless video.  Horrible camera work, blurry most of the time, sound was awful.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1174262400,2,107,4.888888888888889
2075722,5,B0002BSHWU,"Cedar, 21 months, LOVES this video and asks for it all the time. He isn't focused on the numbers past 4 or 5 yet (they count the trucks, 1 through 20), but the trucks fascinate him. He also seems to respond to the kids' voices throughout (they shout out answers and help with the numbers). I had read some reviews about poor videography ... whatever. It's not Spielberg, but it's not bad or grainy or a ""garage production."" Cedar could care less ... images are of TRUCKS, explanations of truck, showing how truck parts work. It's a winner here and I'm glad I purchased it. So is Cedar.",1168473600,2,585,4.425925925925926
2075723,1,B0002BSHWU,"My son loves trucks and tractors, so I thought this video would be great- it is absolutely unbearable.  The only thing redeeming about it is a cute song- naming twenty different trucks.  After the song, the video goes through each truck more in-depth.  This would be alright except the two ""voices"" discussing the trucks are grown women trying to sound like little girls (complete with ""giggles"")- the result is just the most annoying, high pitched, nasally sound that is so bad, I find it intolerable.  There is nothing in the video that is worth this suffering- just buy ""I Dig Dirt"" (it too features girls and women- if you're looking for a video for little girls about trucks) and/or ""Real Wheels; Truck Adventures (Tractor, Dump Truck and Farm Truck)"" and your child will have seen twenty trucks, learned a cute song, and you'll still be sane.",1168473600,3,848,4.787671232876712
2075724,5,B0002BSHWU,3 yr old grandson liked this video.  Good for helping children recognize different trucks so on trips they can tell you what they see.,1167868800,,134,4.583333333333333
2075725,5,B0002BSHWU,"Our one year old son loved trucks and starting saying ""Ruck"" and pronouncing the ""K"" sound.  Well, after buying him this video, he actually learned how to replay the ""Twenty Trucks"" song from the main menu.  He starts clapping and smiling when the song plays.  He especially likes when the tractor trailer honks it's horn and is mesmerized by the concrete mixer and the moster truck.  When he wakes up in the morning, he crawls right over to the DVD player and starts pushing the play button.

I would rather have our son watch a video like this instead of cartoons because it is educational.",1148774400,,592,4.6
2075726,2,B0002BSHWU,"Wow, what a bore. The old stock footage is uneven and doesn't show enough of the truck. Other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street. The song is OK, but once that's over my son walks away. Why would a child who LOVES trucks walk away? Because some guy's voice (which sounds like it's in an echo chamber) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he can't SEE on the screen. What's on the screen? More garbage stock footage. This looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone's basement.",1139875200,5,539,4.346534653465347
2075727,5,B0002BSHWU,"My son got this DVD for Christmas.  He just turned two and he loves it.  The best part is that thanks to the song and the numbers that flash introducing each type of truck, he can count to twenty and identify the numbers when he sees them as well.  I agree with some of the other reviews, the narration is bland, it sounds sort of like Ferris Beuler's teacher, (Anyone? Anyone?) and the production quality is that of any locally produced training film, but the kids love it!  My three year old daughter can now also identify flat bed tow trucks and most importantly,  Mommy can have a good un-interrupted 40 minutes or so to get things done like dinner or a shower!  Worth the money, hands down.",1139616000,2,695,4.390625
2075728,2,B0002BSHWU,"I own several Real Wheels movies and thought I would give this one a shot.  I found the picture quality to be less than I expected and the footage seemed out of date.  The narration was dull and boring, and the children's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying.  I would recommend any of the  Real Wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover.",1137196800,6,403,4.194805194805195
2075729,5,B0002BSHWU,My 4 year old son received the Twenty Trucks video for Christmas and it was a huge hit! The entire family sings along and shouts out the truck names. Great fun! I am also thrilled that the Twenty Trucks video has helped clear-up any confusions my 4 year old had with numbers from 1-20. He has made a list of 20 more trucks in anticipation of what he might put on a sequel.  My 2 year old son is loving the video as well.  He is shouting out numbers and truck names almost as quickly as his older brother!,1136851200,,504,4.08080808080808
8025761,5,B0002BSHWU,If your kids love construction trucks like ours then you have to own this video.  It is a great and fun way to learn about all kinds of different construction trucks.,1451260800,,166,4.354838709677419
8025762,5,B0002BSHWU,Bought this for my truck loving 2 yr old nephew. He loves it! Does the trick.,1449446400,,77,3.875
8025763,5,B0002BSHWU,"My grandson, who is 2 1/2 loves this video!  He wants to watch it over and over again.",1437091200,,86,3.7777777777777777
8025764,5,B0002BSHWU,My boys LOVE this video - it's very nicely produced.,1430524800,,52,4.3
8025765,5,B0002BSHWU,My grandson LOVED this cd and we had to watch it over and over again.!!!,1429574400,,72,3.8666666666666667
8025766,3,B0002BSHWU,Was not the video I thought it was - so my fault on this one.  Very closely related to Truck Tunes - did not know the difference.,1429228800,,129,3.7777777777777777
8025767,5,B0002BSHWU,my son loves this one,1425686400,,21,3.4
8025768,5,B0002BSHWU,Awesome for a little boy.  My 17 mon old son could watch this over and over and over!,1406851200,,85,3.7222222222222223
8025769,5,B0002BSHWU,I have had it less than a week and my 18 month old boy is obsessed. we have watched it no less than 3 or 4 times a day... seriously. He loves trucks.. like the real thing. He doesn't care for cartons of any kind but loves this video because its all real videos of semi's and dump trucks and tell about each of the twenty trucks' jobs. I think its great!,1406505600,,353,3.9166666666666665
8025770,2,B0002BSHWU,"We bought Truck Tunes last year and our boys absolutely love it! After seeing a couple new videos called ""Twenty Trucks"" on YouTube (also by Hammershark Media) we thought our boys would love this truck music video DVD, too. We were disappointed because there was NO truck songs on this DVD. I guess The video itself is fine. It gets a little boring and the kids lose interest by about truck 11, but if you have a truck-loving kid, they'll probably like it.",1404691200,4,456,4.506024096385542
