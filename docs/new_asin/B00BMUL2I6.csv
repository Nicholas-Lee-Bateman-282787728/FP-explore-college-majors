8571097,1,B00BMUL2I6,"This is more like a couple of guys getting drunk and thinking about making a haunted film with the strippers they had been watching all night. This film is hardly a tribute to anything other than bad film making.

The movie starts out with make believe found footage of a guy having a birthday party in a strip joint. He gets cross-bow gun and a dagger which he opens up. Then the stripper takes the group downstairs, including the drunk who likes to play with a knife. The blood was fakey. They conducted interviews with a group of flunkies who had trouble making sense because they didn't quite have down that ""noun-verb"" thing.

Yes, interviews with stupid strippers. The film is done mostly documentary style, except for a few scenes, which overall didn't work. They managed to stretch this into 74 sad minutes.

8571098,5,B00BMUL2I6,"For many San Francisco strippers, the Market Street Cinema has landmark status on its Tenderloin block in San Francisco.  But until I heard about this film, I had no idea the theater was just marking its 100th birthday and would close this past February.  It had a history as a first-run theater before it began hosting live strip shows in the 1980s.  Since this movie was shot, three separate paranormal investigative teams have spent time there, and each found evidence that the place is haunted.

During the documentary parts of the film, about a dozen people who have worked at the Cinema, from managers to dancers, are interviewed by the director, Charles Webb.  His own relaxed, unpretentious manner helps his subjects to open up.  We are given an extensive tour through different floors of the decaying building, while dancers perform onstage in the refurbished club, and the ghostly part of the story unfolds.

G-String Horror is a special tribute to the Market St. Cinema, with fervent performances,  down-to-earth interviews, and the supernatural.  At a place where one hundred years of drama has played out, is it surprising that some of the spirits have made it their home?

8571099,5,B00BMUL2I6,"I had the good fortune of catching The G-string Horror at a screening of the film at the Roxie Theater in San Francisco during the Another Hole in the Head Film Festival last December. The house was packed and the audience was as off the wall as the movie. A really good time was had by everyone there. I wanted to buy a copy and decided to check out Amazon. I'm definitely looking forward to the release on June 18th.

The film itself is a bizarre blending of reality and fiction that sometimes seems to take you into another dimension altogether. It gives the appearance of being assembled by a bunch weird tricksters. A paranormal tease put on by ghost strippers and other haunters of the creepy strip club.

The director, Charles Webb, who gives commentary during the movie about the odd things that were happening while he was making it, claims that shots would get inexplicably moved around or disappear completely between editing sessions. The real ghosts of the theater made ""suggestions"" about the way they wanted the film to look.

Whoever had the final cut, I want to see the film again.

Highly recommended!",1370044800,2,1119,4.6938775510204085
