3765553,4,B001QIRT4K,Great DVD of the history making Presidential Inauguration with a lot of nice featurettes. I only wish they had shown both parade walks instead of just the first one.,1237161600,,165,4.724137931034483
3765554,3,B001QIRT4K,"There's Obama-mania out there.  If you want to sell a cup of lemonade, write Obama on the cup.  So ABC wants to make money off their inauguration day coverage.  This is just what they showed that day put on DVD.
Don't get me wrong:  I'm proud to have been in DC on that day.  But if you already saw Aretha's hat or Yo-Yo Ma's string-synching, then this is nothing new.  They show Warren's prayer without speaking of his bias to the rainbow children.  This felt like watching the coverage of a Thanksgiving day parade.
Still, you may want this for posterity.  Your unborn children and grandchildren may grow by seeing this.  The special features section is significant as it shows election night and Obama's entry into the race, etc.  Also, like many, Obama's candidacy was just as important because of Michelle as it was for him.  She is here in healthy amounts and seeing the first African-American First Lady is what makes this era so special to me, even as a brotha.",1236384000,4,969,4.575581395348837

3765601,4,B001QIRT4K,"There are several great Inauguration DVDs available, with great coverage.  However, I specifically wanted this DVD of President Obama's Inauguration because it was from ABC News, AND it included ABC's exclusive coverage of the Neighborhood Ball.  No other DVD has the Neighborhood Ball coverage, and I wanted a reliable source to capture Barack and Michelle's first dance at the ball.

They DID include the Obamas' first dance.  However, they cut the dance down to one verse of ""At Last""!!  They SO cheated the audience of this wonderful scene.  (Thus, the four stars.)

Other than that, this was a wonderful highlights video of this historic occasion.  The extra interviews and other coverage were great, as well.",1240704000,20,714,5.147826086956521

3765605,5,B001QIRT4K,"If you haven't read my review on the Obama Action Figure. I said I saw the inaguration at school. Unfortunatly I erased it from my phone. I even asked my teacher if I could film it. Now I only got up to the part where Obama does his swear in saying ""I Barack Obama"" and his speech (my apologies as I do not remember his middle name). After his speech, Bush and Chenny walk out of the White House and ride out of DC in a black helicopter. Then it cuts to the first interview with Obama and it even shows the first dance of Obama and his wife at the Presidental Ball. I look forward to getting this even though I saw it on the Fox News Channel.",1238371200,,642,3.9844961240310077
