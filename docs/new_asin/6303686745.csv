711984,5,6303686745,"""Duck and cover"" was the phrase most baby boomers came to know as the signal that nuclear disaster was near.  After the Cuban missle crisis, America and her enemy--the Soviets--came to be on pins and needles.  In Fail Safe, those fears are played on to great effect. An American SAC  bomber is erroneously given instructions to carry out its well practiced  mission: proceed to target (Moscow) and drop its payload of hydrogen  weapons. The desperate moves by the American president to turn back the  bomber, his subsequent decision to place American populations at equal risk  to avoid all-out war, and the gut wrenching final moments which leave this  viewer literally in tears, all conspire to make this film experience one  you'll not soon forget.",914112000,,751,4.991935483870968

712135,5,6303686745,"We are at the height of the cold war. We use assured mutual destruction to keep the commies at bay. The main defense is the use of strategic bombers to deliver nuclear weapons. In the event of a perceived thereat we send the bombers to points called Fail-Safe. From there if the thereat is determined to be real the president gives the go signal in a coded message. At a further point there is no recall.

What if the recall signal was jammed?

We are now faced with many questions that move from the theoretical.
Is it a trick?
Will the Ruskies believe it is an accident?
Should we take the first strike initiative?
Is mutual destruction assured?

In today's world it is easy and common place to imagine some artificial intelligence that we have ceded authority to taking over for malevolent or even levolent purposes. We have every type of movie from ""2001"" (1968) with the HAL 9000 to ""The Forbin project"" (1970) with Colossus.

This film however is a lot spookier because it is played out with what looks like could be a real scenario. It also looks like it could have been a play as the action is mostly dialog that takes place in two rooms and the interior of a strategic bomber. It has a claustrophobic feel with the black and white with odd placed lighting.

There are many fine actors in this film. One surprisingly strong performance was by Larry Hagman as Buck the interpreter for the President. The survival of the world hinged on his facial expressions as he had to interpret not just the words but the attitude of the Soviet Premier.",1505174400,,1547,4.530465949820789

712220,3,6303686745,"Fail Safe, as opposed to it's contemporary ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I stopped Worrying and Loved the Bomb"", takes a far more dramatic approach to a similar accidental Nuclear scenario. Top notch acting from Henry Fonda, who portrays the President who struggles to negotiate an acceptable alternative to all out Nuclear war after an accidental attack on the Soviet Union. Strong supporting acting comes from Walter Matthau,who portrays a hawkish civilian advisor with a stone-cold calculating personality. The rest of the cast is filled with forgettable charrcters with somewhat weak backstories set up to portray their various internal conflicts. Unlike Strangelove, which is packed with intense scenes filled with witty dialogue, Fail Safe relies to much on dry technical jargon. It also makes liberal use of extended length scenes revaolving around what Strangelove mockingly referred to as ""The Big Board"". Fonda's time on screen is almost exclusively limited to him being locked away in a cinder block room with an interpreter, taliking on the phone with his Russian counterpart. If your interested in the subject matter, it is a an interesting take on the genre. However, since most modern audiences won't find the technology employed in the USAF command room the least bit impressive today, I think many will find the movie somewhat boring. The final scene, which has the most significant cinematography of the entire film, will certainly leave a lasting impression on most.",1502928000,,1480,5.302127659574468

712631,5,6303686745,"This movie was made just after the Cuban Missle Crisis in 1964.  Henry Fonda is the president and is fantastic.  This is probably my favorite role of Larry Hagman.  Walter Matthau plays a professorial intellectual.  A role I feel is unusual for him.  Look for Don DeLuise as a young airman.  It is my belief that Jonathan Winters also has a brief uncredited appearance.  There are no comedic roles.

The film is stark, shot in black and white, without a music score.  The film presents an impossible dilemma about a situation that supposedly cannot happen.  The feeling I always had at the time, as a youth, was that of two parties armed to the teeth, standing face to face, and holding knives at each other's throats, waiting to see who blinks.

Some movies from the past are great when viewed as a part of Hollywood History.  Some movies are great at any time.  This movie is the latter.  Just be prepared for a serious drama.  I still get an emotional reaction watching this movie.  It may be because I saw it as a youth.  Thank You...",1476835200,,1038,4.494623655913978

712634,4,6303686745,"Fail Safe is one of my favourite 60s movies.  I saw it on TV as a child and thought it was intense.  I've always enjoyed it far more than 'Strangelove', the movie that got all the attention and I'm in no hurry to see again.

This release comes from Australia. I could do without the bright yellow rating logo plastered all over the front of the case. Many countries feel the need to place ugly neon coloured rating logos on the front of the case and it's the main reason I buy US discs wherever possible. The back of the case says the disc is Region B (Europe, Australia and New Zealand), but it is in fact Region free.

This blu ray is a high definition equivalent of the US DVD. The 'Fail Safe' documentary (a 'sell' for the Clooney remake) and the commentary track are the same as the DVD. The blu ray - unless I missed something - has no chapter search menu, but there are chapter you can skip through once you start the movie; although it's not quite the same.

The film grain in high definition is quite something and without a critical comparison between this and the DVD I'd say if you are a collector this is a 'worthwhile upgrade'.

The President (Henry Fonda) is confronted with a failure of the FAIL SAFE when airliner in distress causes an alert from the US Air Force Strategic Command at Offutt AFB (Bellevue Nebraska).  During the recall process, the Soviet Union decides to block all radio transmissions, causing a whole bomber wing (9 bombers, B58 Hustlers) to miss the recall.  Thus the plot of the movie.  With the cooperation of the US and Russia ... only one of the 9 bombers makes it through.  I won't tell the rest of the story, but it's a shock.

713383,5,6303686745,"Possibly the most important movie you'll ever watch. No ""happy endings"" here, just a good hard dose of reality.

I think EVERY living, breathing Human Being on the planet should watch this movie. And if you are a leader of a country, be it President, Prime Minister, King, or whatever you call yourself, you should be REQUIRED to watch this move, before you are allowed to take office. At the front of that line, certainly that young North Korean ""Boy-President"". Maybe Dennis Rodman could talk some sense to him?

This is a movie that might even make the most devout war-monger shut the ""F"" up!

And for you ""New Age"" parents who want to shield your child from ""bad things"", you need to sit your child down at the earliest age possible and watch this WITH them (and then, of course, have a discussion with them). I saw this movie first when I was only 10 and even at that age, it made me THINK. This is a safe way to show your kid the ""bad"" in the world, and what can happen if things get out of hand. If you don't want to impart a dose of reality to them now, don't worry; the World-at-large will do it FOR you, and in a much less polite manner.

Everyone's NOT always a ""winner"" in this world; to teach your kids otherwise is living in ""Candyland"". But hey, you New Age parent out there, your kid is gonna ""get"" that when they get their first REJECTION letter from that college they wanted.

And sometimes we're ALL losers, as in the case of War, ESPECIALLY Nuclear War. Nobody is doing anyone a favor by ""shielding"" them from the bad side of Life; you're only depriving them of the TOOLS to know how to deal with it, when you can no longer keep them ""safe"", and they are confronted with REALITY.

I'm one of the most positive people you'll ever meet (I really am), but you don't necessarily get that way by ignoring ""the Dark side"". In fact, you're more able to deal with the negative aspects in this world if you ADMIT they're there, and RECOGNIZE the fact that ignoring them does NOT make them go away. Otherwise, you just set yourself up to someday be blindsided. It's your choice.

Buy this movie. Stream this movie. But if you're still with me and still reading this, you owe it to yourself to WATCH this movie, and turn EVERYONE you know onto this movie.

This is based on the same book as the movie ""Dr. Strangelove"", which dealt with the subject matter in a humorous way. And it's good for satire.

But Fail Safe is the REALITY, with all the humor and satire stripped away. Not so pretty, huh? And though it was made in 1964, it's just as topical now as it was then. EVERYONE on Planet Earth who's under the age of 70 has lived under this cloud of sudden death, their entire life, whether they choose to acknowledge it or not. That includes YOU.

So please watch this movie. I'm not saying you'll necessarily feel ""better"", but strangely, I'm not saying you WON'T. You'll certainly come away with a deeper appreciation of Life, and how quickly it can all be taken away, without your control or say-so, by people you don't even know. Or sometimes, maybe by people you DO know...

So if you think you CAN handle the TRUTH, I encourage you and your entire family to watch ""Fail Safe"".

Then go watch ""50 Shades of Gray""; I'm certainly not telling you to quit watching ""important"" movies!  :-/ ?",1423699200,3,3303,4.395081967213115

713541,5,6303686745,"Released in the same year as Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Fail Safe suffered in comparison with the similarly-themed and more famous film, which had been released first. This is a shame, because it is an excellent political thriller.

Sidney Lumet made his classic films such as 12 Angry Men, Serpico, Network and The Verdict work so well because of those films' focus on characters and a claustrophobic setting. For Fail Safe he created this sense of  claustrophobia, by shooting the majority of scenes in either small, windowless and sparsely furnished rooms within the White House and Pentagon; SAC Command Center dominated by the screen upon which the drama in the sky is unfolding; and aboard the cockpit of Air Force bomber. There is no musical score throughout the  movie, further underscoring the sparseness of the film's atmosphere. The conversations between the President of the United States and the Soviet premier are tense and believable, an effect achieved largely through the use of Larry Hagman as an interpreter rather than having the two leaders speaking directly to each other.  As time passes, and the stakes grow higher, the tension is cranked up until the US President, is forced to make a horrific decision in order to assuage Soviet suspicions.

The cast is uniformly excellent from top to bottom. In the White House bunker, Henry Fonda as the President gives one of those leading man portrayals for which he was known. He brings just the right blend of authority and humanity to the role. Larry Hagman looks startlingly young and trim as the President's Russian language interpreter.  His mannerisms, such as the blink of his eyes, are very much in evidence as his way of conveying to the President what the Soviet Party Chairman is saying and thinking.

In Pentagon War Room, Walter Matthau as a political scientist the is a dark individual with a cold analytical streak that is soon unmasked to reveal a streak of military fanaticism. Counterbalancing him is Dan O'Herlihy as Colonel  Black, the voice of reason throughout.  The Black character is a framing device for the entire film; it is his recurring nightmare that opens the film and it is the reality of that nightmare that ends it. O'Herlihy's work in Fail-Safe is among the finest of his 50-year film and television acting career. At SAC headquarters in Omaha, both Frank Overton and Fritz Weaver are memorable as senior air force officials dealing with the crisis, and in Anchorage, Ed Binns is effective as the pilot of the lead bomber.

Beyond the cast, the most striking aspect of the film is the atmosphere it creates. The film is in black and white; it's lit from above or the sides creating a stark and sparse environment. This look and feel is uniformly maintained throughout the duration of the film as well as at all its locations. In fact, there is much about Fail Safe that is suggestive of the  film noir genre, from the visual style to the mental distress of the principal characters.

By dint of its basic plausibility, its suspenseful script, and the uniform excellence of its cast, it is the epitome of cold war films, on par with its contemporaries dealing with the same subject: Dr. Strangelove and The Bedford Incident.",1410652800,,3231,4.897435897435898

713548,5,6303686745,"If you enjoyed books or films like the 'Hunt for Red October', you will enjoy this great film.  The film has lost currency over the years due to the end of the Cold War and the unfortunate fact that 'Dr. Strangelove' was made in the same year, literally a parody of the Cold War and films like this.
The film concerns a mistaken attack order for nuclear-armed bombers(US) to attack Russia.  The struggle to recall them proceeds along with the angst of having to bring them back...or down...by any means necessary.  If they cannot, then the repercussions are obvious and ominous...

There are first-rate performances by all of the key actors involved, which helps make this film frighteningly realistic.

713719,5,6303686745,"As does his big-screen debut, ""12 Angry Men"" (1957), Sidney Lumet's ""Fail-Safe"" continues to speak volumes today -- a half-century after its release.

As in 1957, Lumet's use of relatively spartan sets and modest effects work to this film's advantage (as does the total absence of music); combined with Gerald Hirschfeld's stark B & W cinematography and dramatic camera work - and Ralph Rosenblum's adroit editing - the often claustrophobic tension is synergistically heightened. Minor technical flaws (as in the brief stock footage) can be overlooked, as they do not compromise the storyline.

Lumet employed two fine actors from his 1957 film, Henry Fonda & Edward Binns, in a superb ensemble cast.

Fonda's portrayal is the very model for what many expect an American president to be; his distinctive voice, mannerisms and cool decisive nature define the character.

Dan O'Herlihey imbues Gen. Black with the knowing resignation of one trapped in a dilemma with no solution, who must play out his part to the inevitable conclusion.

Successful on stage & television, this was Fritz Weaver's big-screen debut. He lends great pathos to his portrayal of Col. Cascio; inner demons are kept bottled-up until the breaking point - when they erupt at a critical moment of the crisis.

Known best for comedy, Walter Matthau proves his dramatic abilities as Prof. Groeteschele, loosely based on Herman Kahn, a founder of the New York Hudson Institute (with a sprinkling of Edward Teller thrown in). (After obtaining a M. Sc. degree from Caltech, Kahn was recruited by the RAND Corporation. It was there that he published his seminal treatise, ""On Thermonuclear War"" (giving a nod to ""On War,"" by Carl von Clausewitz). This was the genesis of the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction ('MAD').)

Giving perhaps the finest performance of his too-short career, Frank Overton as Gen. Bogan instills in his character wisdom, humanity and quiet dignity (as in the role of Sheriff Heck Tate in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" 1962). Rather than an autocratic or callous commanding officer, Bogan displays understanding and compassion.

In a late scene, realizing his mistake and that it means the No. 1 plane carrying the bombs will almost certainly reach its target of Moscow, Marshall Nevsky, with whom General Bogan has been speaking over their ""hot line,"" collapses and is replaced by General Koniev.

After a brief exchange with Koniev about a last-chance possibility of stopping the plane, Bogan says, ""You speak English very well, General.""

Koniev: ""I was liaison to your headquarters in London, during the war.""

Bogan: ""I was stationed right outside of London.""

Koniev: ""Yes, I know; at the Eighth Air Force.""

Bogan: ""Did you like London?""

Koniev: ""Very much.""

Bogan: ""So did I.""

Koniev: ""The great cities are those where one can walk; I would walk all the time in London. Wherever you turn, there's history.""

General Bogan is handed a SAC dossier on General Koniev and leafs through it; seeing Koniev's photograph he asks, ""General, are you in Moscow now?""

Koniev: ""No; I was ordered to leave.""

Finding a photograph of the general with his wife and children, Bogan starts to ask whether his family is safe - but stops himself before any words are spoken, instead saying simply, ""It's a hard day.""

Koniev: ""Yes, a hard day."" (Pause) ""Goodbye, my friend.""

""Goodbye MY friend,"" replies Bogan with the resignation and sorrowfulness of one bidding farewell to a lifelong friend.

More even than an object lesson in how adults handle a crisis of cataclysmic proportion, ""Fail-Safe"" is a still-relevant cautionary tale about misplaced faith in sophisticated technology and the possible ramifications therefrom (as in ""Colossus - The Forbin Project,"" 1970), perfectly enunciated in this exchange:

KNAPP: ""The more complex an electronic system gets, the more accident-prone it is. Sooner or later, it breaks down... A transistor blows, a condenser burns out. Sometimes they just get tired, like people...""

GROETESCHELE: ""But Mr. Knapp overlooks one thing. The machines are supervised by humans. Even if the machine fails, the human being can always correct the mistake.""

KNAPP: ""I wish you were right. The fact is the machines work so fast, they are so intricate, the mistakes they make are so subtle that very often a human being can't know if a machine is lying or telling the truth.""

Of course, the obvious comparison will be made to Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" (1964), based on the novel ""Red Alert,"" by Peter George (originally published in the UK as ""Two Hours to Doom"" under the pseudonym of Peter Bryant). It was not a comedy (nor was it nearly as well-written as the Burdick-Wheeler novel); Kubrick and George turned it into the black comedy classic it became.

With Kubrick having substantially more clout than Lumet at that time, George suing Burdick and Wheeler for plagiarism and Columbia Pictures releasing both films, though ""Fail-Safe"" was 'in the can' first, it was held back - and the movie-going public got to yuck-it-up over the prospect of thermonuclear annihilation. After all, Stanley Kramer's stunning film ""On the Beach"" (1959) had not yet faded from the public's mind, the Cold War had recently heated to a boil with the Cuban Missile Crisis - and President Kennedy had just been assassinated. People needed to laugh, if even at a black comedy. In large part as a result, ""Fail-Safe"" was not a box-office success; posterity has treated it quite differently.

Niels Bohr's famous quip, ""There are things that are so serious that you can only joke about them,"" notwithstanding, an earnest discussion on trying to avert the total annihilation of the planet is deadly serious - and on every level, ""Fail-Safe"" remains an outstanding, riveting and truly harrowing film, all too relevant even today - for there is no highly-complex technology that is truly ""Fail-Safe.""",1393977600,,5948,5.091563786008231

713822,5,6303686745,"Fail-Safe takes a minimalist approach, but manages to include the political/philosophical/military differences toward nuclear weapons, and the benefits and dangers of the reliance on computers and machines to make our decisions for us. This is accomplished by the internal debate among 2 of the characters. This debate is very well done and keeps the movie on track, raising the tension and philosophical issues at every step.

Beyond the viewpoints, this movie is riveting. The setting and environment, the seriousness of the subject, and some excellent performances create a atmosphere of danger and anxiety. Henry Fonda is good, as always, but Larry Hagman is amazingly convincing. The star of the movie is the overhead map, which depicts the inevitability of the military developments and the worst fears of of its leaders.

714004,5,6303686745,"It is the middle of the Cold War and the United States maintains fleets of bombers with nuclear warheads stationed across the globe ready to strike the Soviet Union should a situation require it. During a routine investigation of an unidentified flying object, one fleet of bombers erroneously receives a signal to proceed to bomb Moscow. No one wants a full-scale nuclear war and the rush is on to avert it any way possible.

Due to its similar premise, this movie seems doomed to forever be compared to Dr. Strangelove. While Dr. Strangelove used a similar scenario for laughs, Fail-Safe provides a serious, dramatic look at the prospects of what could go wrong when two countries have nuclear weapons constantly pointed at each other and the dangers of putting too much technology in command.

The acting in the movie is excellent with memorable performances by Walter Matthau as a cold-blooded political scientist who only sees the number of possible dead as a statistic and Henry Fonda as a commanding U.S. President.

The DVD also includes a very interesting audio commentary by the late director Sidney Lumet who, despite how old the film is, provides many interesting recollections about the making of this film.

714010,5,6303686745,"Fail-Safe, 1964 film

It begins with a man leaving his wife in the early morning, he dresses in his military uniform. In Washington DC a political scientist talks about the effects of a thermonuclear war. Who will win? Is this crazy talk or a game? We see other military people. Crews on the bombers are changed regularly. [No cohesion or trust?] Bombers are in the air continuously in case of a surprise attack. Satellites can detect humans on the ground. Radar can detect a UFO. Bombers fly toward a fail-safe point then wait for a signal to attack. The system is ""fail-safe"", nothing can go wrong by design. The group discusses mass attacks on civilians. Can this be minimized? Maybe not. Can a ""limited war"" be fought? A nuclear war would exterminate most people. The next stage of readiness occurs when that UFO alters course. Condition Green occurs!

That UFO is a commercial airplane that is off course due to a mechanical problem. The warning is called off. But one flight of bomber goes on. Can it be recalled? Fighters are sent after it to recall it or shoot it down! Three is a discussion over this. The President orders it done. Any airman who falls into the freezing ocean will perish. The President talks to Omaha. Was it a mechanical failure? The more complex the system the more likely it will have a failure. The Russians sent up their fighter airplanes in response. That Professor has an explanation. Does it make sense to you? [Who is the crackpot here?] The pursuit fighters ""flame out"" and crash into the sea, the bombers fly on. The overtones in speech can provide information about the speaker. The President calls the Premier to warn him. Will he be believed? Is there trust? The Russians have their fighters, and missiles too! Can they stop the bombers?

The flight of six bombers crosses the Russian border, a state of war. Radar shows the results. The Premier talks to the President. Was Russian jamming the cause of that mechanical failure? Yes. Their computers decided that this American flight was a threat. The President orders General Grady to turn back. Will he obey? He only follows orders. Can the Russian fighters stop those bombers? No, their anti-radar masks their true position. The Professor asks for a sneak attack! Communication between Omaha and Moscow is established. General Black will follow orders. The President acts to prevent a general nuclear war by ordering full cooperation with the Russians. There is a way to over-ride the radar and infrared detectors on the missiles. The bombers fly lower to evade radar. Will the tension affect a military officer?

What will the President do? Will he trade New York for Moscow? What else can he do to evade a general war? This action is the only way out. The Russians will launch anti-aircraft rockets against the last bombers. Can they be defeated? The bomber pilot's wife talks to him, will this work? Would an alarm cause a panic in a big city? They talk about the deaths and destruction that would occur. What happens when machines get out of control? What do we say to the dead? [We didn't mean it?] There is a high-pitched squeal from the telephone to Moscow. The President order s the bombs dropped! And so this cautionary message movie ends. The Defense Department says it can't happen here.

This movie was adapted from a novel. In 1962 there was an incident when radar warned of a massive missile attack from the west. The top general did not allow a counter-strike. The investigation found that the newer and more powerful radar detected the moon rising over the horizon and misinterpreted the echo. The result was to create a teletype hotline from Washington DC to Moscow for immediate contact. A nuclear test ban followed. Any nuclear war would create a nuclear winter from dust thrown into the atmosphere and kill off most people.",1357862400,,3836,4.771084337349397

714111,5,6303686745,"1964's ""Fail-Safe"" has spent decades in the shade of its still popular nuclear-age contemporary, ""Dr. Strangelove"", whose over-the-top dark humor has proved more agreeable to audiences.  ""Fail-Safe"" probably deserves more credit than it has gotten; its minimalist cinematic approach, like ""Twelve Angry Men"", depends on some very solid acting and a twist ending to create a realistically tense movie.

The premise of ""Fail-Safe"" is a cascading series of errors on both sides of the Iron Curtain that set up the United States and the Soviet Union for a potential nuclear holocaust.  The action is seen entirely from the US side, as a double handful of fine actors portray the US officials who must deal with the crisis.  Henry Fonda convincingly plays a US President trying to stave off a full-scale nuclear exchange over the hot line with Moscow, with the help of a young Larry Hagman as his interpreter.  Walter Matthieu has a rare dramatic role as a presidential advisor, while fine Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy has a key role as an US Air Force General.  As the US and Soviet Union relentlessly move toward war, the US President face a chilling course of action, one that he may or may not be allowed to carry out.

This particular theme, in which mistakes lead to a nuclear confrontation, has been done several times in the movies and on television, for both dramatic and comedic effect.

714203,4,6303686745,"This 1964 film was presented shortly after the nail biting Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 in which Americans realized the distinctive possibility that two Superpowers could wipe each other off the face of the globe. In this instance the tale focuses upon the U.S. Strategic Air Command which is trying to impress its higher ups when a series of coincidences lead to false alerts and then finally leads to several bomber aircrafts preparing to nuke Moscow. The President and other advisors are called in as things go from bad to worse. At one point it gets so bad that something horrible has to happen but see the very bottom if you want to read the spoiler.

The film was purposefully shot in black and white with close ups that bordered on claustrophobic. The Soviets are never shown but we get details from the translators and things heighten and generals begin collapsing from the stress and being replaced. It's a tense film that may arguably not mean as much today as it did back then. People of the Cold War years will appreciate this film the most, I suspect.

It stars a number of big names like Henry Fonda, Walter Matthau and Frank Overton. I noticed some brief roles by Larry Hagman and Dom Deluise as well but I believe this was before they became bigger names. A recent televised play remake came about in 2000 with George Clooney and others starring. They did it in black and white as a homage to the original film.

Based on a 1962 novel of a similar title by Eugene Burdick. It was well loved by critics but didn't do as well as the Box Office because it was in competition with a similar and less serious film DR STRANGELOVE.

Moscow is nuked because a bomber crew won't believe they should be called back and that their American President has gone soft so even with the wife screaming on the phone at the head bomber guy he unloads the bombs.

714205,4,6303686745,"If you liked Dr. Strangelove, you should see this. This is the serious movie which was spoofed by Strangelove.

Henry Fonda plays the President (never given a last name, only a title), Walter Matthau plays Dr. Groeteschele, which was presumably the model for Strangelove. Larry Hagman (wasn't he in a sitcom later? Maybe ""I Dream of Jeannie"" or something?) is the interpreter sitting in the war room with The President. Dom DeLuise, looking amazingly young, is a sergeant who keeps his head when higher ranking officers are losing theirs.

The basic story is about the nuclear-equipped planes which are kept in the air at all times so as to respond quickly to a war emergency. As I understand it, this movie had the effect of pointing out some major flaws in the system and having them changed. Their was a UFO on the radar: not an alien ship, but simply an unidentified one. The planes are to go to their fail-safe points and be ready, and generally receive a return to base signal and all is fine. But once the UFO was identified as a commercial plane that had malfunctioned and therefore was unidentifiable, one of the fail-safe planes did not get the message to return to base. It takes awhile to find out why this happened, but in the meantime they have opened their sealed orders and found that their target is Moscow.

So there they are on their way to Moscow, their radio is jammed, there's some screw-ups in the electronic equipment, and what can be done? Dr. Groeteschele says turn it into a full-scale war, since a strike on Moscow is going to make it that anyway, and if we act at once, we have a chance to wipe out enough of the USSR that they will simply surrender. General Black says no, we need to convince the Soviets that it was an error, and ask them to shoot down the bombers.

There are lots of things wrong with every possible choice, and I certainly will not ruin it for you by telling you how it plays out. Let's just say that it raised the hairs on the back of my head when I saw it as a teenager, and it just did it again tonight after all these years.

Directed by Sidney Lumet

Based on the novel by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler, Fail-Safe tells of what happens when a misguided transmission sends a squadron of bombers hurtling towards Russia, fully prepared to drop their atomic weaponry on Moscow. Air Force commander Frank Overton desperately tries to establish radio contact with the bombers, but once the pilots have passed the ""fail safe"" point, they've been instructed to disregard any reversal of orders. Racing against time, US President Henry Fonda, through his interpreter (Larry Hagman), informs the Russian premiere of the impending nuclear disaster. Working in concert with SAC, the Russians send up interceptors to shoot down the American bombers, while some of the planes run out of fuel and crash. Unfortunately, one aircraft, piloted by Edward Binns, manages to escape destruction and continues on its fatal mission.

Special footnote: ~ Columbia Pictures produced both this movie and 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Director Stanley Kubrick insisted his movie be released first, and it was, in January 1964. When Fail-Safe was released, it garnered excellent reviews, but audiences found it unintentionally funny because of ""Strangelove"", and stayed away. Henry Fonda later said he would never have made this movie if he had seen ""Strangelove"" first, because he would have laughed too.

714290,5,6303686745,"I've seen this film many times, along with Dr. Strangelove and The Bedford Incident.

Although each film in its own way raises goose bumps of fear in this viewer, and always has, Failsafe is one film that comes closest to
what might have transpired had the Cuban Missile Crisis (at about the same time) reached a fatal conclusion - WORLD WAR III AND TOTAL NUCLEAR CATASTROPHY!

Some people and reviewers believe the movie is somewhat dated - a product of the times, the times - of course - being The Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union...I strongly disagree!

Today, more than ever - despite a large drawdown on both sides of nuclear missile stockpiles - we must be ever vigilant against something like this occurring!  True, the major powers are well aware of the catastrophic consequences should any side choose to start a nuclear holocaust, or should it happen by mistake (a more likely scenario...or is it!), but the terrorists who managed an
incredible holocaust on a grand scale (if you were a victim or a family member of a victim of 9/11, you'd agree, I'm sure, that is WAS on a grand scale!) on 9/11 are no fools!  More and more we must
be alert to new contacts made by any of several murderous terrorist organizations with nuclear powers like Pakistan and upcoming ones like North Korea!

Small nuclear devices smuggled out of these countries, and fanatical
nuclear scientists who agree with ""Jihad"" against the West who willingly volunteer to help smuggle out, prep and prime small nuclear devices, and the underling terrorist dogs who crave ""Paradise"" by sacrificing themselves in blowing these things up in, let's say in a major U.S. hub city - a port, for example - are
the real dangers we must be wary of.

AND THIS INCLUDES ""AMERICAN JIHADISTS"" BORN AND BRED IN ""THE LAND OF THE FREE"" WHO ARE RECRUITED INTO TERRORIST RANKS BY AL QAIDA SPEECHES OR VIDEOS SMUGGLED INTO OUR COUNTRY!

We just saw a very small attempt on the part of an American Muslem (just look at the name!) who studied Physics at Northwestern and built large electronic model planes designed to hold massive amounts of explosives and rigged to fly into the Pentagon and Capitol buildings!
This, and the Oklahoma bombing, alone should be a warning sign, as this movie (and the other two great movies mentioned, as well!) was...AND STILL IS!

If you haven't seen Failsafe, Dr. Strangelove, or the Bedford Incident - get 'em all in updated DVD format!  Even the hilarious
Peter Sellers in a three-part role in Dr. Strangelove is ""scary as hell!"".

Even if you only want to watch three great movies with great screenplays, actors, and scenarios, and - of course, great directors - you will NOT be disappointed.  And, if you're like me,
you WILL be ""scared as hell"" at what could happen in the not-too-distant future!

And, as they say, ""The rest is history""!",1317168000,,2849,4.719758064516129
714291,5,6303686745,"Just about anyone who came of age during the Cold War will find Fail Safe chilling and still relevant.  Deterrence was based on the very real prospect of mutually assured destruction.  In spite of right-wing think tank products such as the late Herman Kahn's On Thermonuclear War, it was clear to anyone who thought about it with a head unclogged by ideological absurdities and half-baked policy wonk speculations that an exchange of ballistic missile-borne nuclear warheads between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would leave the world uninhabitable.  And that was before anyone had foreseen the phenomenon we now know as nuclear winter.

In spite of that, there were vainglorious, Kissingeresque hawks on both sides.  Walter Matthau does a superb job, almost salivating at the prospect of finding out if tough and violent convicts protected by their prison walls, or organizationally savvy file clerks, insulated by shelves and cabinets loaded with thick reams of paper, would prevail in a war among the likely survivors.  Yes, as we learned in Viet Nam and Iraq, ivory tower intellectuals, chicken hawks to a man, can be very dangerous, destroying the lives of thousands of patriotic soldiers and ordinary civilians.  In Fail Safe it's the career soldiers and airmen, people who have actually experienced war, who prevail, at least long enough to provide painful but essential perspective.

Henry Fonda, not one of my favorite people, but perfect for the role of the U.S. President during an unprecedented international crisis, also understands what's at stake.  He, and eventually the Soviet leadership, understand that complex systems will eventually malfunction, and may bring us to the brink of mutual annihilation.  They also know that even accidents acknowledged as eventually inevitable may exact a terrible toll.  A good faith gesture that costs millions of lives to restore a still-precarious balance.  A horrible trade-off, the price paid to save the world, at least for now.

The flip side of Fail Safe is made all too real by Richard Widmark's portrayal of the Captain of a state-of-the-art enemy submarine chaser in The Bedford Incident.  Just as machines inevitably malfunction, men pushed too hard for too long become exhausted, error prone, and desperate.  When the people in charge are so Hell-bent on wreaking havoc on an audacious and resourceful enemy, the eventual results are easy to foresee.  I've never known if the torpedoes fired, in one last act of defiant fatalism by the doomed nuclear submarine were nuclear tipped.  That only makes The Bedford Incident a more sobering complement to Fail Safe.

During the Cold War, the enemies were well-defined and mutually accessible, subject to a reign of destruction that neither side wanted and both sought to prevent.  Today, with nuclear proliferation occurring in both nationalistically celebratory and surreptitious ways, there are more ideologues willing, perhaps even eager, to destroy the world.  Actually, it seems odd that it hasn't happened yet.

Fail Safe is still pertinent, but it's also a film for another era.  It's pertinent because nuclear weapons are at least as destructive as in the 1960's, and the systems that control them are even more complex.  It's a film for another time, however, because current international circumstances are laced with heavier and more varied doses of fanaticism, and there are more enemies who are harder to find.  Makes the Cold War sound like a good thing, a precarious set of circumstances, to be sure, but one with built-in stabilizers, even if they were imperfect.",1316995200,,3585,5.205574912891986

714293,3,6303686745,"Contrary to the description given by Columbia Pictures, this is NOT an anti-war movie.  It is an anti-America movie.

First, it is true that the acting is top-notch.  The character development is varied and rich.  The sets are few, and therefore more powerful.  The camera angles pull you into each scene, including a few sweaty close-ups of less than full face.  The pace and plot quickly become captivating.

HOWEVER, where this 1964 movie goes is almost unspeakable.

The timing of its production is important to know.  In 1962, U.S. President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Khrushchev had done a somewhat similar bluff/bravado regarding the Soviet ""secret"" missiles pointed at us in Cuba.  The two leaders then ""agreed"" to mutually remove (or was it ""relocate"") certain nuclear weapons.  But the writers of this propaganda story had ""better"" ideas, and Henry Fonda was the ideal lead.

Does the movie make you think?  I hope so.  But whether the ending repulses you or makes you smack your lips against America, reveals whether you are an American patriot.  ""President"" Fonda urged us all to be a ""patriot.""  Note that the one ""Fail Safe"" commander who tried to stop the others from revealing our key defense secrets to the Soviet Communists was accused of ""treason.""  Before you choose to vote for President in 2012, consider this movie and consider who it was who committed treason.

The supposedly unavoidable single option which ""President"" Fonda faced was not the only option.  Even if our bomber was headed to Moscow due to ""our"" mistake, no American President has the legal or moral authority to attack our nation.  The Constitution (which every President must swear/affirm to ""preserve, protect and defend"") which creates the office of President does not provide the absurd power to attack the United States.  Article 4, Section 4, obligates our entire federal government to ""protect"" the states ""against invasion."" The power which Article 1, Section 8, gives to Congress is to ""provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.""  So, Pres Fonda needed to tell whoever in Moscow that he does NOT have the option of bombing our own people.  Then, if our bomber took out Moscow, our President's sworn duty to protect OUR country might mean doing what Walter Matthau suggested -- take out the rest of their weapons, before they take us out.  If someone is not willing to stand up to protect OUR country when the situations get difficult, they should never have sworn to.

The role/authority/power of a U.S. President is not to try to make the world all even out, like a corrupt referee who makes bad calls to try to keep the score close so feelings (supposedly) don't get hurt.

Did you know that in 1970, six years after this movie, Jane Fonda (daughter of Henry) said in a university speech; ""...if you understood what Communism was, you would hope, you would pray on you knees, that we would someday become Communists.""  Then in 1972 in Communist North Vietnam (yes, this was while we were at war with them), Jane Fonda had her smirking picture taken pretending to be praying, while kneeling on one of our enemy's anti-aircraft guns.  This is part of Henry Fonda's deserved fruit from Fail Safe.

Part of the cowardice of Fail Safe is that it ""ends"" with ""President"" Fonda's bombing of our New York City.  The promoters and lovers of this movie's message do not want to have to explain their horrific notion of heroism.  Nor do they want to have to answer for the effect of this supposedly valiant decision by ""President"" Henry Fonda.  One of the many lessons of 9-11-01 is that Americans, who differ on so many topics, agree that an attack on just one part of one city of our nation is an attack on us all.",1309305600,10,3738,4.801251956181534

714299,5,6303686745,"My first viewing of this film took place on a trans-continental TWA night flight, from LA to NYC, just prior to its being released in 1964.  The occasion for this ""Sneak Preview"" was brought about by the fact that the author of the original best selling novel, Eugene Burdick, was also on board this flight and TWA had obtained special permission for its viewing in his honor.  This particular flying experience was memorable for me for two reasons:  one; I was seated in first class next to the actress Jill St. John, who remained wrapped and lifeless in her mink coat until we touched down at Idlewild (JFK) airport, and two; just at the moment in the film when New York City is about to be wiped off the face of the earth by a Russian nuclear weapon, our jet became wrapped in a violent patch of air turbulence, which in no small way contributed to the events taking place in the film at that moment when the city is being obliterated in a blinding flash of light.

This film holds up quite well and still provides a thought-provoking and nail-biting experience - even without the turbulence.  The acting and overall production values are excellent and the black and white format only adds to the feeling of doom and desparation.

I would single out Walter Matthau's performance as the real gem here.  His ""winnable limited nuclear war"" speech to the generals is truly insane and brilliant, all at the same time.  Fonda and Hagman do well as two men trying to avert apocalypse, and Fritz Weaver's debut is a sad and disturbing examination of a wounded soul.  Frank Overton is great as General Bogan, and Dan O'Herlihey is quite brilliant as a general with impending doom written all over his dreams.

Forget ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Night of the Living Dead."" For my money, there is no scene in any movie more suspenseful or terrifying than that of Henry Fonda, playing the President of the United States, on the phone to the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, waiting for the high-pitched squeal that will terminate their conversation forever. The squeal will be the sound of the ambassador's telephone melting.

Sidney Lumet's ""Fail-Safe,"" based on the Cold War bestseller by Burdick and Wheeler, may be black-and-white and incredibly low-tech, but it has lost none of its power to make audiences jump out of their skins after nearly five decades. This tautly paced film presents an all-too-believable doomsday scenario--how technical and human errors bring about an all-out nuclear war--and it is all the more frightening for its matter-of-fact presentation. Lumet demonstrates, for all time, that what a movie DOESN'T show can create far greater dread and horror than what it does. The presence of well-known actors--Fonda, Walter Matthau, Larry Hagman, even Dom DeLuise and Sorrell ""Boss Hogg"" Booke--does not detract from the suspense one iota. If anything, their presence intensifies the terror--if it can happen to them, it can happen to us.

It's too bad ""Dr. Strangelove,"" that greatest of black comedies, was released just before ""Fail-Safe,"" thus ensuring the box-office failure of the serious movie on an identical theme. Both movies are amazing, and they would make a great double feature. But be sure to watch ""Fail-Safe"" first!",1287792000,5,1648,5.286259541984733
714342,4,6303686745,"Even after all these years--after devouring the novel way back in high school, then watching this film on several occasions--FAIL-SAFE still feels like a body blow to the midsection.  It literally sucks the air right out of you.  It brings back vivid memories of living in the Cold War Era (yep, I'm older than dirt); of ""duck and cover"" drills in school; of constant fear and anxiety that someone--either on this continent or across the world in Red Square--would push that red button and life would forever be changed. . .if it survived at all.

FAIL-SAFE brings it all back.

An equipment malfunction.  A glitch.  And suddenly a group of American fighter pilots armed with nukes are ""ordered"" to leave their Fail-Safe checkpoint and proceed to Moscow--no matter who, or what, comes over their radios to attempt to persuade them to go back.  And these guys are well trained.  And their radar jamming and masking technology works just fine; it's inevitable at least one of them will make it through to the target.  So what must the U.S. do to convince the Soviet Union it's all a horrific mistake and avoid a nuclear holocaust?

Thus the tension is created, augmented by director Sidney Lumet's craftsmanship as a filmmaker.  Close-ups.  Angled camera shots.  Silhouette lighting.  Everything to ratchet up the tension and drama.  The cast is exceptional, led by Henry Fonda as the President--a stoic commander-in-chief who must make a terrible decision affecting the lives of millions.  Other cast members include Walter Matthau playing a war hawk political scientist, a very young Larry Hagman as Fonda's Russian interpreter, and a young, pudgy Dom DeLuise in a brief role as a nervous sergeant. One star deducted for the needless, contrived melodrama that periodically thrusts its way to the forefront (alas, that's how flicks were made in those days).  For those who haven't seen FAIL-SAFE, and who want to watch a tense, compelling, engrossing film, this is right down your alley.

Walter Matthau is far from comedic as the coldly philosophizing man who thinks killing 40 million to save the rest is a bargain of sorts.

I remember it vividly but upon watching something again so many years later I always prepare myself to be disappointed - but there was no need for that preparation. I was very pleased that this movie was every bit as good as I remembered it. The cast is just stellar and the direction tight and well-done. I especially enjoyed Fonda's performance as the President (who wouldn't have voted for this guy - he just looks like a President) and Larry Hagman's depiction of the translator oddly named just ""Buck"". The story itself is chilling and (at the time) quite plausible. The effects leave a lot to be desired even for 1964 but as the director's commentary explains the military did not want this film made and prevented the producers from obtaining any accurate footage of planes or the actual locations (White House, SAC headquarters, etc.).

The picture quality is acceptable but nothing spectacular with occasional but non-bothersome contrast changes and film splices seen in a good print but without restoration. The special features include a short documentary on the movie featuring George Clooney who produced the live-TV remake done in 2000 (which I have never seen but would now like to). The interviews give some insight into both the cold war and the accompanying blacklisting of writers - one of which wrote this film under a pseudonym. The full length director's commentary yields some interesting insights into the obstacles to making the film (as noted above) and some of his technique including camera positioning and pacing of edits / cuts but overall was a bit less interesting than other director commentary tracks I have listened to.

714346,5,6303686745,"I believe this cold war thriller to be a real scare movie in that it could have happened. A Sidney Lumet film in black and white based on a novel by Burdick and Wheeler. The USAF did not cooperate in the use of any film sequences for the SAC headquarters or the bombers,so we get stock footage of B58 Hustler planes renamed `Vindicator Bombers'.This film was sued due to its similarity of theme to Dr Strangelove which was based on a different book. However I feel this subject matter is technically and dramatically different. Serious treatment of the subject is warranted. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis(1962) the world was on the brink of nuclear holocaust. Machine or man-made error was a distinct possibility. Due to the assertion of hardware malfunction leading to what transpires in the film USAF/Defence Dept.withdrew their support and the film had a minimal budget. The action scenes are set for the most part in bunkers, the Strategic Air Command headquarters and on planes. A computer error sends a squadron of SAC bombers hurtling towards Russia to drop their atomic weapons on Moscow due to the use of an attack code instead of a recall order. AirForce Commander Frank Overton tries to establish radio contact with the bombers,but once the pilots have passed the `fail-safe' point,they've been instructed to ignore any reversal of orders. Their radios have been jammed by the Russians. US President Henry Fonda( and interpreter Larry Hagman)racing against time are unable to call them back due to the fail-safe system and alert the Russians of the impending nuclear disaster to avoid retaliation. He has to convince them it's an accident. Working in concert with SAC,the Russians send up interceptors to shoot down the American bombers. Fighters have tried to shoot them down but run out of fuel and crash. Oneaircraft piloted by Edward Binns,escapes destruction and continues to its target. Fail-Safe uses a minimalist documentary format with the use of strong top light,with claustrophobic close-ups,legato sustained shots,dolly shots and long silences. Tension is realistically maintained and is stepped up at each stage. There is a battle of ideas between Groetescele's(Mathau) idea that ATOMIC WAR WAS WINNABLE and the concept of limited war,an extreme machiavellian anti-marxist,vs General Black(O'Herlihy)whose ominous dream opens the film,he sees how unstoppable nuclear war is. In desperation, the President offers to sacrifice an American city(relying on hisold buddy `Blackie' to do the deed knowing his wife and kids are there) if his pilots succeed to bomb Moscow. This cold war thriller builds tension and suspense with its use of the big screen at SAC headquarters to chart the movement of bombers on a World Map.

He obsessed about this after his ill-fated 1961 Vienna Summit with Nikita Khrucshev, and it almost hapened during the Cuban Missle Crisis in October of 1962.

Kennedy was smart enough to avert this, but that standoff made the possibility real for Americans. I have said this in other reviews, but if you are my age, born in 1969, you caught the tail and far less dangerous end of the cold war.

But from the end of World War II until the end of the Missle Crisis, the unthinkable was quite thinkable, every day. I collect Time Magazines from the 1950s and 1960s, and you could sent away for a backyard bomb shelter as we now do for books, CDs and computer eqiptment.

If you think of those first few months after 9/11, during the anthrax attacks, this is probably the closest people of my era have ever gotten to how palpable this fear was.

Fail-Safe from 1964 shows just how easy accidental incineration could have been. Two American pilots misread radio messages and start flying into Western Russia to unload the bomb. It takes awhile for the people in the military to understand what is going on. The pilots are called back , eventually, even by President Henry Fonda. But it is too late. There are a series of orders and checks that go horribly wrong--the steps meant to avoid error wind up causing the worst error of all.

This is war by massive systematic error and blind obeidance to systematic proceadure. The pilots are following orders, but orders of a regimine that does not reveal its flaws until it actually is activated.

Fail-Safe is no scinence fiction horror show. Directed by the great Sidney Lumet--if I could do reviews like he did films, I would be trouncing Harriet right now, but she has nothing to worry about --it shows the doves, moderates, hawks (Walter Matthau) and crazies (Fritz Weaver) all trying to influence Fonda, in his calm and centered playing of the president. (This could be any president. He is not meant to be LBJ, in office when Fail Safe hit screens.)

All the acting is great, but  I really have to single out Matthau--he got his big name doing comady, but he plays an amazingly creepy hawk here, who thinks this crisis is an oppotunity to win the cold war. His charactor is cold, calcualting, and truely insane.

FAIL-SAFE is THE Cold War masterpiece, while its predecessor is a clumsy, unamusing and ill-advised Stanley Kubrick work. The chance of nuclear annihilation really exists and is not something to make light of.

In FAIL-SAFE, Henry Fonda is brilliant as President of the United States and Larry Hagman in only his second motion picture is equally superb. It's Hagman's job to interpret what the Soviet premier says to Fonda over the hotline as a group of American bombers with multiple 20 megaton bombs heads towards Moscow, but he must also give impressions of the Russian's feelings and intentions. It's grueling work, and knowing that humanity may be on the brink of extinction is clearly delineated by Hagman, who should've won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts.

In fact, this remarkable drama did not receive a SINGLE Oscar nod.

Near story's end, tension and fear have built to the breaking point, then after an extended agony of suspense, Bang Bang Bang, like a champion boxer landing a trio of rapid-fire blows, events unfold one-two-three and everything ends in utter tragedy. The absolutely avoidable, unthinkable, impossible happens and following one final brilliant bit of quick multiple edits in a 20 second space, the screen goes black.

714372,5,6303686745,"Rather than echo the plaudits of the reviewers before me, all of which I am in full accord, I'd like to offer another observation.

The most frightening aspect of this movie is that it speaks of a mass fear that is specific to the last two or three generations. The fear of the willful destruction of all life on this planet through the technological method. Consider the kind of neurosis and fear that gripped the last three generations. A fear that any moment the whole of human society could be instantly incinerated. This fear has been a deciding factor in the unfolding of western culture since the end of WW2, and it would be a poor student or scholar of history who fails to see this.

I quote John Fowles (from The Magus):

""The threat of nuclear catastrophe had stimulated the economic production, ensured peace (to some extent), and provided a sense of real danger behind every moment of life. The result was an amoral era in which consumerist self-gratification against a backdrop of imminent doom produces entire populations of autoerotic and autopsychotic people. Economic isolation and psychological isolation from states of poverty and human suffering will be a norm. The result is men of moderate intelligence, little analytical power, and no science; coupled with the inadequacies of the pseudo statements of low-quality art and confused value judgments, utterly incapable of meeting their evolutionary roles. He has been launched into a world with no training in self-analysis and self-orientation; and almost all the education he received is positively harmful to him. He was born, so to speak, blinded by his environments; and cannot find his way.""

This is the heritage of the nuclear age.

The movie, and indeed the source of its inspiration, imposes upon the whole of the human race a single question: are we wise enough to master ourselves and the power we now possess? Are we evolved enough to face the responsibilities that the momentum of human history has imposed upon us?

One thing we must face that is truly disturbing is this. Throughout the history of the world since 1945, nuclear war has been averted on several occasions. What one must ask is weather our leaders did so owing to a moral choice and a sense of responsibility to God and His human creation, or weather they were simply motivated by a desire to preserve their station? The practical upshot of this, from their point of view, is that nuclear war would end human society; and as a result, end their political power. From a purely political perspective, this would be a terribly irresponsible thing to allow. Yet, how does this affect the rest of humanity? Does this reduce the individual to a disposable commodity, a statistic devoid of all human and spiritual value? And even worse, how many human beings regardless of station, rank, and ideology are, almost exclusively by choice and consent, truly below a level of such consideration?

Furthermore, how did humanity devolve to the point of using science and the subtleties of nature in such a horrible manner? What kind of human being could willingly build such devices? What corruption of mind and spirit could look at the world, its resources, and peoples, and say ""If I cannot possess and control it, then nobody will!"" Because that is, in stark reality, the statement that every nuclear weapon ultimately makes. And why do we willingly permit such people to run our governments, industries, militia, media, educational institutions, and economy?

""Fail Safe"" forces these questions down our throats, and dares us to answer them honestly. That is, if we have the courage and honesty to do so. The candid answers to these questions should terrify us more than this movie ever could.",1246406400,,3734,4.9347133757961785
714373,5,6303686745,"FAIL SAFE catches the mood of the fear of the sixties and viewings today confirm that fear has not waned.  Director Sidney Lumet takes the bestselling novel by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler and presents a nightmare scenario of a nuclear holocaust that the concluding disclaimer of its unlikelihood cannot erase.  This is one of those movies that invite repeat viewings with each one revealing an unappreciated aspect of the symbiosis between cast, crew, and filming technology.

There is a tendency to judge FAIL SAFE with the similar themed DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, but the comic undertones of the latter are replaced by a stark grimness that is heightened by the grainy black and white filming that shows the cast caught in a claustrophobic series of vignettes that range from the War Room of the Pentagon to the President's private room to the cockpit of a jet bomber.  Lumet uses shifting camera angles to unexpectedly heighten tension during key scenes.  Even seemingly innocent scenes benefit from this shift.  Remember when Buck the translator (Larry Hagman) enters an elevator only to see the back of a man who turns his head to reveal that he is the President (Henry Fonda)? Or when Colonel Cascio (Fritz Weaver) rises from his chair which is discretely below camera range to reveal his horror at having been ordered to reveal to the Soviets classified secrets that he cannot force himself to divulge?  Scenes such as these typically are framed within a box of some sort.  Even when the box is huge such as the War Room or cramped such as in one of the cockpits of the attacking jets the feeling of increasing tension crackles.

FAIL SAFE is mostly a series of ""small"" scenes that are strung together with the cast limited to that scene. The most powerful man on earth, (the President) is seen almost entirely esconced in his tiny private office.  His advisors, led by Professor Grotechelle (Walter Matthau), operate within the much larger context of the War Room, but they are helpless to do no more than advise a man who in all probability has already made up his mind.  And then there are the pilots led by Colonel Grady (Edward Binns) who are right there in the front lines but can do nothing but follow a preprogrammed course of mutually assured destruction.

What emerges from a multiple series of viewings is the unsettling notion that the horrific events of the destruction of Moscow and New York are made horrific not so much by simply noting their destruction, but by using the full power of the film media to subliminally insinuate in the minds of the audience that mass destruction is more of a function of the senses than of reality.",1246233600,,2654,4.783369803063457

The story is chillingly real-very much something that could have happened. A group of bombers fly fast the 'failsafe' point armed with nuclear bombs and headed for Moscow.  The whole set of events that is set in motion by this is so artfully and suspensefully woven together, that once you start watching it, you really can't stop.

All the actors are perfect for this film, especially Walter Matthau as a cynical political strategist who believes that the USSR and America could survive a nuclear exchange.  You will also see a very young Larry Hagman as a Russian translator (pre-""Jeannie"" days) who spends most of his time in the movie with the President played by Henry Fonda.

714471,4,6303686745,"This movie was created at the height of the cold war era when Americans lived under the paranoia of nuclear Armageddon unleashed by a Russian sneak attack.  The storyline almost completely parallels Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, in fact so much so that Kubrick et al. strategically filed a copyright infringement suit against the studio that produced Fail-safe to delay its release.  What differentiates Fail-safe from Dr. Strangelove is that while Kubrick uses humor and satire to mock at the absurdity of nuclear paranoia, Lumet skips the humor to give the story a serious treatment in Fail-safe.

The main plot in both movies revolves around the inability of the Americans to recall the launching of an unintended (in Fail-safe) or unauthorized (in Dr. Strangelove) nuclear attack on the Russians using long range bombers.  In both movies, the high-caliber patriotic fervor of the American bomber crew played a key part in the Americans' inability to cancel the attack once the ""go-code"" was given.  The movies point out the weak links in both the human factor and also the technological limitations that can trigger a nuclear war.

Although Fail-safe opened to miserable ticket office sales, it's a great thriller with a believable storyline.

""Fail Safe"" was filmed in 1964 at the height of the Cold War nuclear anxiety.

President (Henry Fonda) and the Soviet Premier must work together to try and diffuse the situation and ultimately to solve the problems our failed 'fail safe' system created.

I am aware this film was redone in color and I am not sure it could ever be as good.  The starkness of the black and white adds to the drama and period authenticity of the situation.

714550,5,6303686745,"Fail-Safe (Sidney Lumet, 1964)

That Sidney Lumet has traditionally been one of America's finest directors almost goes without saying; this is the man who directed 12 Angry Men, Long Day's Journey into Night, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Network, and Equus, among many, many others. Fail-Safe came relatively early in his career; while he had done a good deal of television work, it was only his sixth big-screen feature. It takes the tension of 12 Angry Men and ramps it up another couple of notches.

The story: a series of mechanical mishaps causes a routine alarm to turn into a potential nuclear catastrophe when a flight of bombers doesn't receive a stand-down signal. With the bombers on their way to deliver a nuclear payload to Moscow, the president (Henry Fonda) gets into a frantic series of impromptu peace talks with the Soviet premier. Meanwhile, we're also given glimpses into the cockpit of the lead bomber, the control room where things went wrong, and a Pentagon war room whose cast have become last-ditch advisors to the President. Their job is somewhat complicated by the presence of a pundit (Walter Matthau) who believes this is the perfect opportunity to launch a strike that would wipe the Soviet Union off the map forever.

While it's never explicitly stated, the action seems to take place in real time. This is a tricky trope to pull off (and when it doesn't work, it really bombs, viz. Brian de Palma's Snake Eyes), but Lumet handles it perfectly. As well, Lumet, who is well-known for getting the best out of actors, wrings every last drop from everyone involved here. And there are many-- Fonda, Matthau (as with many comics, put Matthau in a serious role and he gets scary), Dan O'Herlihy, Frank Overton, Fritz Weaver, Larry Hagman, Dom DeLuise, and many others turn in fantastic performances. When filming a suspense movie, though, great performances can only get you so much; the director also has to have a sense of timing. Spend too long in one scene and you kill the pace; speed up too much and you've got an action flick where nothing happens. Lumet keeps it right where it needs to be. And, of course, you need something unforgettable, something that will stick in the viewer's mind for years after they've seen the film (and in 1964, you had to do it within the confines of the ""we don't have a ratings system, but you'd better be family-friendly"" atmosphere of Hollywood). Without giving anything away, that's the movie's final scene. You'll never hear a piercing electronic shriek in the same way again. Well, not that you ever heard it much before, but still.

It's probably impossible to put together a ranked list of Lumet's major films; you'd have too many tied for first, and Fail-Safe is one of them. **** ",1198108800,3,2752,4.809725158562368
714551,2,6303686745,"I used to think this movie was an incredible one.  The idea of a flight of US bombers being dispatched by mistake to attack Moscow and the desperate efforts by both the US and the Soviet Union to stop them is loaded with high drama.  The movie also has a power cast headed by Henry Fonda.

But looking back at this film after serving in the military and government for more than 20 years, the movie is fraught with problems.  For one thing, the film casts the US in the role of (accidental) villain.  If you look on Wikipedia, for something called ""Dead Hand,"" you'll see it was the Soviets that had something that could have automatically launched a massive missile strike on the US if the computer running it judged that the Soviet Government had been obliterated by the US.

Another moment that I found totally unbelievable was the scene where the wife of the man commanding the errant flight of US bombers is brought into the NORAD command center to tell him his mission is a mistake and to beg him to turn back.  The commander of the bomber flight coldly rebuffs her for fear he is the victim of a communist trick.  Come on!  I would imagine that any married couple have intimate secrets between them that no one else could possibly know and that she could use to establish that she was who she said she was.

Finally, the ending is totally beyond belief.  Facing the fact that the bombers are about to destroy Moscow, the US President (played by Fonda) tells the Soviets that to ""compensate"" them for the loss of Moscow, a US bomber will drop a hydrogen bomb on New York City.  And the movie ends with this being done.

<if anyone is inclined to get angry because of this ""spoiler"" I would tell them, ""The movie was released almost 50 years ago!!>

Set aside the fact that the President of the United States ordered the murder of millions of his own countrymen (including his own wife).  How many people seriously believe anyone in the US military would obey such an insane order.  I'm no longer in the military, but if the President gave me such a crazy command, I wouldn't feel bound by it and I would feel it was my duty to do everything in my power to stop him from carrying out such a mad scheme.

Maybe my version of the movie would end in nuclear war.  But the real ending of ""Fail Safe"" as it was filmed would have been the President and probably everyone in the White House being placed on trial for treason (""levying war against the United States"") if they weren't lynched en masse first.

I guess some people would ask:  well, what would you do then?  Well, I might reply that such a scenario couldn't happen.  But if it did, I could see myself telling the Russians that we had made a terrible mistake and would massively indemnify them for the destruction of their capital and would submit to an international inquiry and would be willing to negotiate a mutual nuclear disarmament regime.  Maybe that wouldn't work, but there's no way...none at all...that I would ever see myself doing what the President in this movie does or following his orders.",1193097600,4,3066,4.484684684684685

The USAF never carries nuclear weapons on training flights. They used to fly combat air patrols as they did in ""Fail-Safe"" (called ""Chrome Dome"")until 1966 when a ""Broken Arrow"" incident occurred. A B-52 collided with a KC-135 tanker during refueling and dropped its four Mark-28 thermonuclear weapons around Palomares, Spain. Since then the USAF ceased Chrome Dome. Incidentally, the B-52 intentionally released its nuclear payload as it is designed to do (in either a ""safe"" or ""armed"" configuration) in an emergency.

Somehow Peter Sellers humourous spin on things coupled with the superb final vision of Slim Pickens riding down on the bomb to the sounds of ""We'll meet again"" just had everyone I know crying with laughter at the stupidity of it all. Surely nobody would let this sort of thing happen, would they?

. Looking at this film again many years later and it seems to have regained it's power to depict the frighteningly easy way in which we can slip into the abyss. The superb acting of Henry Fonda and Walter Mathau bring a terse and well written script to life, with the young Larry Hagman totally believeable as the Presidential interpreter.

As we watch events unfolding in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the race of uncontrollable powers in the Third World to produce and stockpile nuclear weapons along with their delivery systems, ""Fail Safes"" chilling message becomes as relevant today as  it did so many years ago.

Watch this film, then look at our present day political leaders. Apart from the fashions, has anything changed? The starkness of black and white as opposed to colour filmstock only serves to underline the warning that there is no middle way, we have to choose now as we had to choose then.

I only encountered two problems:

1) Original film quality

A digital restoration of the original film print is in order, I noticed a lot of graininess and flecks in the image.

2) Larry Hagman seems to be slightly confused with Gene Hackman in the filmography under 'special features'.

For example, Larry Hagman is credited with an appearance in the 1978 Superman movie. Lex Luthor was played by Gene Hackman.

The situation is handled, if not resolved, with a truly horrifying result.

No shortage of GREAT acting here... Henry Fonda as The President... Larry Hagman as the translator who helps during phone conversations between The President and his Russian counterpart.

Dom DeLuise appears as one of the techs at the US Air Defense HQ; this is the only ""serious"" role I've seen DeLuise play.

714605,5,6303686745,"This movie rises above what could have been just a polemic against letting machines get away from us and letting patriotism goad us to killing the ""enemy."" It evolves into a singular, gripping drama.

The one false note is Walter Mathau's early reaction to a woman sensually in love with death, a woman craving finishing climax. All that is a gratuitous artsy touch. And then there is a lapse or two in logic. As other reviewers have pointed out, the bomber pilot who is pushing through with what he thinks are his orders, could have proven to himself that it is in fact his wife and not a Soviet imposter trying to tell him to stop, trying to tell him it was all just mechanical failure. He could have simply asked the woman pleading with him some questions that only he and his wife would have known the answers to.

But these minor quibbles aside, Sidney Lumet was absolutely at the top of his form with this movie. He is the master of projecting us into the gritty tragedies of so-called civilization. With Fail Safe, he plummets us into the ultimate tragedy.

The acting is brilliant. For me, this is Henry Fonda's defining role. He is supremely Presidential, considered, able to withstand the pressures of jingoism and to put human life first. He is the statesman one can only wish our real Presidents were. Although as this movie illustrates, having a wise leader can't always avert disaster.",1145145600,4,1399,4.65587044534413
714606,4,6303686745,"This movie was very good to excellent, (VG++ on my reading scale).

I did not give it 5 stars because there were some technical issues and minor character issues that kept me from giving it a whole hearted 5 star result.

I had read in another review that it would have been helpful to have had some actual footage of the Vindicator bomber to make the movie more realistic. That is quite true, and in addition it would have been helpful to have had some soviet aircraft also. The only thing in defense of the director of this movie for not including actual footage of aircraft from each side is the fact that we forget this movie was made during the height of the cold war and there was a lot of paranoia over security on both sides. Therefore, it would have probably been impossible to show actual Soviet Backfire Bombers, fighters, or even actual Vindicator maneuver footage. This would have made the movie more interesting.

I believe this movie will be considered extremely intense by anyone who lived during this time period. The fear of nuclear war was a very real fear, a very real frightening possibility. Just remember the Cuban Missile Crisis. We were very close to warfare at that time. Very close. I do not know how many people realize this, but nuclear war was certainly a possibility if we had sunk any of the Russian cargo ships. They surely had submarines with nuclear warheads prepared to defend these ships and we had the same prepared to defend our ships. One punch would have led to two then a flurry of punches. How do you stop this from escalating?

I thought the acting was mostly superb. Even Walter Mathau's slap of the woman he drove home, which struck me as not necessary and idiotic, was ok if you consider he was probably being type-casted as a ""moral"" oriented person. Yet later in the story he favored us attacking the soviets, going all out now that we were mistakenly committed with those 6 bombers approaching Russia. This is not an indication of some one who is being type-casted as a ""moral"" person. When is war for war's sake moral? Therefore, I viewed this as a character flaw. Instead, if he had tried to make advances with her, but was then slapped by the woman, I believe that this would have been more consistent with his character. This might be considered a minor point, but the whole point of this story was the intensity of each person's response to the incredible pressures of a potential nuclear war breaking out. Consistency would have added power to this movie.

One other point on technical matters. It was not clear whether or not the soviets used nuclear tip missiles against the bombers. It was shown as such - nuclear fireballs blooming a portion of the situation board. This was not discussed in the film. I think if the characters monitoring the situation boards had pointed this out or made issues of this, the use of nuclear tipped missiles against the bombers, this would have been a telling point that would have increased the overall suspense and approaching terror of what was about to occur - the bombing of Moscow.

One last point, the Soviets had caused the bombers to enter Soviet airspace by scrambling the radio reception when they were at the fail-safe point, this prevented the bombers from getting an all clear signal. Thus, the bombers continued with their mission and it was the inflexiblity of their training that resulted in the situation getting out of hand. So the Soviets should have shoulder some of the blame for the situation occuring at all. Finally, when radio contact is restored, the wife of one of the pilots tired to tell her husband it was all a mistake. He would not listen because he was trained, indoctrinated to not listen to anyone in case the Soviets used this sort of thing as a ploy to fool the pilots in not dropping their bombs. Yet. if I was that pilot, I would have asked my 'wife' a simple question only she and I knew the answer to. If she answered correctly, I would know it was her calling me and not a Soviet ploy. Once the pilot realized it was all a mistake he then has one choice, return home, no one gets killed. That is how intense this story was, you just wanted this 'idiot' of a pilot to ask some key question, to use some smarts to avoid an obviously horrendous situation from occuring to begin with. So was he being a 'patriot' by blindingly following orders, or should he first be a member of humanity and try to avoid making a terrible mistake? Think of all the potential answers to this question.

714612,4,6303686745,"I have always been fascinated with the Cold War, especially the nuclear side of things. The fact that the US and the USSR engaged in 'Nuclear Upmanship' during the 1960s would mean increasing the nuclear stockpile on both sides. Of course, accidents can (and have) happened.

With a great deal of thought, planning, systems implementation, checking and control, a system was implemented ensuring that even in a 'DefCon 1' situation (that's where Nuclear War has been declared), the deployment of nuclear weapons, so it was thought, could be 'controlled' and accidents could be avoided.

So, what happens if that 'fail-safe' does actually fail? What implications are there when one of your own bombs Moscow? What options do you have? Do you continue? Do you stop? If you continue, the end result is fairly obvious; if you stop, what would you do to pay for your 'accident'?

This is the kind of situation this film explores, and it does a darn good job at it. It is impactful, but just a little on the talkie side.

714683,5,6303686745,"""Fail Safe"" (1964 - 112 minutes), photographed in Black & White, is a drama of science fiction directed by Sidney Lumet from the script of Walter Bernstein, based on the book of Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler.  Fails in the system of the Strategical Air Force Command of the United States sends orders for six B-58 bombers, equipped with nuclear ogives, to bomb Moscow. General Bogan [the actor Frank Overton], Commander of the Air Force, tries desperately to establish contact by radio with the bombers pilots, but they had been taught that once exceeded the ""security limit"" any order of reversion must be disrespected, because the enemy can know how to imitate the voice of the commanders and even of the president. Running against time, the president [the actor Henry Fonda], helped by Buck, an interpreter [Larry Hagman], informs to the Russian prime minister the imminent nuclear disaster. Working with the Strategical Air Force Command, the Russians send all their antiaircraft armory to knock down the American bombers. Unhappyly, an aircraft commanded by colonel Grady [Ed Binns] escapes and continues in its fatal mission. Perceiving that Moscow is doomed, the president takes then a radical decision to prevent the Third World-Wide War.

In Time: There was a remake of ""Fail Safe"" produced in live with 85 minutes by CBS in 2000, directed by Stephen Frears. In this film, also in times of the Cold War, an unidentified flying object intrigues the American army that orders some bombers to investigate. When they arrive, they  discover that it was only a commercial airplane out of its route. However, a fail in the computers of the Department of Defense sends to a squadron of bombers a transmission of the codes of a nuclear attack. The orders are irreversible and indicate that the target is Moscow. From now on, the Pentagon and the proper president of the United States fight to prevent the Third World-Wide War.

714686,4,6303686745,"In 1963 Columbia Studio had a bad bout of cognitive dissidence. They were developing two projects that were like fraternal twins, DR. STRANGELOVE and FAIL SAFE; both based on best selling novels. Stanley Kubrick, who wrote and directed DR. STRANGELOVE, threatened to quit, or sue everyone in sight. Columbia decided to release STRANGELOVE first. This was a bonehead political decision, not an artistic one. Kubrick had decided that the subject of nuclear holocaust was too intense to present in a straight dramatic fashion, so he created a classic farce out of it. In retropect we can see STRANGELOVE is a comedy classic, but I would submit that the audiences, the world of 1964 needed a good dose of drama, of grim pessimism, of unclouded ascerbic rhetoric, and more awareness of how close we were to the brink, and to the haphazardness of accidental and total nuclear destruction.

FAIL SAFE was shot in black and white, starkly lit, and presented to us like a short jab to the solar plexus. It has been called a ""Cold War film noir"", and it certainly was that. It's plot hook was clarion; through a series of human and computer errors, an American squadron of Vindicator bombers would lose contact with SAC, and would end up flying past the ""fail-safe"" zone, and head into enemy territory by mistake. The pilots were trained to disregard all radio transmissions. Ed Binns did a fine job of playing the pilot, Major Jack Grady. So even when the President got through to him, and his own wife was put on the horn, he switched them off, and proceeded toward his top secret target--Moscow.

Sidney Lumet directed this film. He had a reputation for being a director with a lot of technical knowledge, nurtured for decades while doing live drama on televsion during the Golden Age of the 1950's. He also was known as a director who could get top notch performances from his cast. He was applauded as an ""Actor's Director."" He, also, had an extensive career working as an actor on Broadway, and before that in Yiddish theatre. He believed in rehearsing the material, and this paid off with solid performances from the entire cast.

Walter Matthau played Professor Groeteschele. This was a complex role. The character had to be Kissinger on crack, a civilian defense consultant who believed in probabilites and percentages and America striking first. He has always been very effective in dramatic roles, even though he is mostly remembered for his comedic ones. Henry Fonda as the President was excellent. He was so good, we wished he could have really been President, rather than say an actor like Ronald Reagan. Fonda displayed just the right amount of humanity, strength, humility, and heart. He pulled it off magnificently.

Fonda was helped immensily by Larry Hagman, playing Buck, the interpreter. Before he dreamed of Jeannie, before he monogrammed J.R. on his lapel, he was just this skinny bright-eyed kid who could act; showing subtlety and compassion. My favorite character was Brig. General Warren Black, played by Dan O'Herlihy. He represented the voice of reason, the good man immersed in a bad situation. He was an old school chum of the President's, who called him ""Blackie"". When the President decided to sacrifice NYC as a token of our sorrow for nuking Moscow, it was Blackie he had to trust to drop the payload; even though the First Lady, and Black's family were in town.

FAIL SAFE as a film came at you like a rocket sled; relentless, austere, unblinking, and graphic. There was no comic relief, and no musical score. The message was crystal clear. It was an uncompromising vision illustrating the folly of our total reliance on machines at a time when even the slightest error in human judgement, or computer logic, would have catastrophic results.

714784,5,6303686745,"It's strange how two movies covering the same subject are released months apart in the same year. Especially how one of the two films are successful at the box office. The other, not so successful. That is the case of two films being released by Columbia Pictures in 1964, when the United States Of America was still recovering from the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War was still at an all time high. The two films were none other than Stanley Kubrick's Cold War satire Dr. Starngelove (made entirely in England) and Sidney Lumet's classic anti-war picture Fail-Safe. While the late Kubrick's picture dealt with the madness of nuclear war on the black comedy level, Fail-Safe approached the subject from a much more serious perspective. The results led to the movie going public being scared out of their wits, for fear of something like this actually happening. Kubrick's film dealt with man going mad and declaring war. Lumet's film dealt with the machines breaking down and leading the human race on the road to global annihilation. Or to be more precise, it shows us what the consequences are when humanity puts too much trust in the machine and its systems. There is always a margin for error when man and machine are moving too fast and become dependent on one another.
Fail-Safe begins in Omaha, Nebraska with a US Congressman being given a tour of the Startegic Air Command's control facility by the commanding officer. What seems to be a minor electronic malfunction occurs during an alert when SAC bombers are flying at their fail-safe points. From there, the situation rapidly worsens and bombers are given an order to fly to their targets in the Union of the Soviet Socialistic Republic. The President and the Omaha staff try desperately to recall the planes and it looks for a while like they have succeeded. They then notice that one group of planes, Group Six, is still flying toward Russia. The group is unable to receive the recall code because the Russians are experimenting with new radio jamming proceedures. The supporting fighter planes are returning to their base in Alaska when they are informed of the dilemma with Group Six. They are ordered to turn around and try to intercept the group wing and shoot them down if necessary. Everyone involved knows that this is a desperate measure because the fighters are low on fuel. They fall into the Arctic Ocean before even getting close to Group Six. The President and the people at NORAD eventually help the Russians to try to stop Group Six. What follows is a shocking end that will bring back memories of September 11th, 2001 AD. One wishes that the city of Los Angeles was the victim instead of....well, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out.
With its multi-dimensional screenplay (based precisely on the original 1962 novel) and solid acting from the astounding cast (Henry Fonda, Larry Hagman, Fritz Weaver, Frank Overton, Dom DeLuise, Walter Matthau, Dan O'Herlihy, Sorrell Brooks, Edward Binns, and Dana Elcar), Fail-Safe still brings the message across after forty years. Not only does it reflect the political and social issues of the time, it still states that sometimes our weapons can grow faster than our wisdom. The Cold War maybe over, but the human race still face the possibility of a nuclear war with the likes of the entire Middle East and North Korea.
Fail-Safe is still a gripping reminder that something tragic as this could still happen. It will also make you stop and think.",1046304000,9,3483,4.835845896147403
714785,5,6303686745,"""Fail-Safe"" has often been described as ""Dr Strangelove"" without the laughs - even in the Amazon review above! - well, as much as I'm a huge fan of ""Strangelove,"" I feel that this description does ""Fail-Safe"" a terrible disservice. In ""Strangelove"" Kubrick took the Cold Ward doctrine of MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction, and turned it into a megaton black farce, whereas ""Fail-Safe"" takes the same concept and presents it as frighteningly banal reality. And it's this very ordinariness that makes ""Fail-Safe,"" in my humble opinion, the superior and far more chilling film.
The basic set-up is simple; it's the early 1960's and the Cold War is pretty frosty. During the standard investigation of a UFO by the military, a possible incursion into US airspace by the Soviets, the nuclear bombers that are always in the air are sent towards their ""Fail-Safe"" points, about which they orbit while waiting to be sent to their targets if the UFO turns out to be a pre-emptive attack by the USSR. The alert turns out to be false, an off-course commercial airliner instead of the Red Hoards, and the various flights are recalled. But a technical error occurs, and one flight of 6 aircraft, armed with multiple 20 megaton nuclear weapons, passes beyond its ""Fail-Safe"" point and heads towards it's assigned target of Moscow.
What happened?! Is this a deliberate act of aggression on behalf of the USA, or is it a ""glitch"" as they claim, or are they running a double bluff, disguising an act of war as a technical error, or has the situation been engineered by the Russians as a pretext for a devastating counter strike; what are the Americans and the Russians to do, can they possibly trust each other? These are the central questions of the film.
The emotional core of the film is Henry Fonda as ""The President;"" the decent humanitarian personified. It's as if his character, ""Juror No. 8/Mr Davis"" from ""12 Angry Men,"" has been made Commander In Chief. As he's desperately trying to convince the Soviet Premier that the nightmare of global destruction they're rushing toward is the result of a dreadful accident, he even uses the same line repeatedly that his character in ""12 Angry Men"" uses; ""Is it possible?!"" And these, by far, are the most riveting parts of the film, The President, locked away in his bunker beneath the White House with his interpreter, superbly played by a VERY young Larry Hagman, talking to the Soviet Premier on the Kremlin ""Hot-Line.""
Knowing that the Russians are watching, the President sends US fighters after the bombers to shoot them down before they can reach Soviet airspace; the attempt fails as each of the fighters runs out of fuel and ditches in arctic waters, losing the crews. He then contacts the Premier and explains the situation, the accident, and discusses what can be done to stop a nuclear war if Moscow is bombed.
And this scene, by far, is one of the most chilling ever filmed. The President, speaking through his interpreter, makes a desperate offer to the Soviets; a terrible sacrifice of blood will be made if even one of the bombers gets through and drops its payload on Moscow. I don't want to say anything else about this wonderful film and ruin it for you if you haven't already seen it, suffice to say, that this scene, almost 40 years on, still has the power to make your blood run cold.
But as superb as Fonda's performance is, the film is not wholly dependent upon him. There is a wonderful ensemble cast headed by Dan O'Herlihy - ""The Old Man"" from RoboCop - Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, and, in his first staring role, Fritz Weaver. Of the supporting cast, Walter Matthau, as the right wing Hawk, Professor Groeteschele, desperately urging the President to take advantage of the screw-up and nuke the Soviets to dust anyway, thus ensuring the final victory of Capitalism over Communism, almost steals the show; a wonderful performance. And Fritz Weaver, in his first staring role, takes his part and runs with it, as an uptight Colonel, gradually coming undone as the countdown towards WWIII accelerates.
This film, superbly acted by all concerned, even Dom DeLuise in a bit part as a weapons technician, and flawlessly directed by Sidney Lumet, is an almost forgotten masterpiece. Filmed in stark black and white, it has an almost documentary feel about it, and with the story set in just 4 main locations, there's a suffocating feeling of claustrophobia about the whole enterprise. This is, without a doubt, along with 1965's ""The Bedford Incident"" - WHEN are we going to get a DVD release?!?!?! - the greatest of the Cold War thrillers, and I recommend it without hesitation.",1043020800,7,4636,4.8327044025157235

Fail Safe is a far-too-real scenario that has almost happened a few times. On a few occassions, both America and Russia came within 2 minutes of starting World War III, due to technological
""glitches"", such as satellites mistaking the Sun's reflection off of clouds for the heat of an ICBM.
The message the movie tries to make is that mankind was becoming too dependent upon technology. And we were going to pay the ultimate price for this. It's amazing that the authors of the novel the movie of the same name is based upon had such great ""vision"" and foresight.
Fail Safe also does a fantastic job of showing the Cold War paranoia of both the American & Soviet military and government ""higher ups"".
For those who have not seen it, the ending will send a chill down your spine, and may even bring tears to your eyes!
There were great acting performances all around. The actors that played General Black & General Bogan, the two ""voices of reason""
in the military leadership are two of the best performances I've ever seen. Henry Fonda brought to life his role as the most powerful man in the world. The late Walter Matthau was outstanding as the politcal scientist-Pentagon advisor who wanted the U.S. to take advantage of the madness to wipe-out our
""mortal enemy"".

714855,5,6303686745,"This movie, although released in 1964 is, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying movies I ever saw.  What this movie shows in sometimes graphic detail what happens when we (the United States), create the ultimate system against war and yet that same system becomes our adversary rather than our ally.  What I mean is this system named ""Fail Safe"" plunges the U.S. into a war with the Soviet Union.  What I like is when the the President (Henry Fonda) tries to assure The Premier of the Soviet Union (in the movie the Soviet leader is referred to as, ""Mr. Chairman"") through his (the President's inturpreter ""Buck"" played by Larry Hagman) that  the attack on his country (the Soviet Union) in general, Moscow in paticular,was an accident through a number of conversations via the offical ""Hot Line"" between Washington, D.C. and Moscow. In the meantime the Secretary of War, played by Walter Matthau, insists that we (the U.S.) should obliterate the Soviet Union including Moscow, from the face of the earth.  The conclusion is exciting because we (the U.S.) have to sacrifice New York City because by that time Moscow and the Soviet Union are wiped off the face of the earth.

714856,5,6303686745,"This is an underrated gem from Sidney Lumet. This film could very easily have departed from its ultimately brilliant course, and been turned into an overblown, over-the-top, unrealistic ""Doomsday"" farce.  But Lumet holds on to reality and presents us with a very realistic, and quite frightening look at what could possibly happen if one of our bombers should get a false message to attack Moscow. Henry Fonda is totally believable as the U.S. President trying to avert a catastrophe. And check out a young pre-""I Dream of Jeannie"" Larry Hagman as the Russian interpreter! I liked Larry very much in this role.  He, like everyone else in this good cast, remains completely realistic and believable. I don't think this film would have had as great an impact on the viewer had it been shot in color. The stark, brooding black-and-white photography adds volumes to the mood and setting of the film.

714857,4,6303686745,"I wonder how many years we would have waited for Director Sidney Lumet's FAIL SAFE to be released in the DVD standard if the 2000 remake hadn't be shot. Holy Mysteries of the global economic laws, I suppose ! But, let's stop the sarcasms and enjoy this black and white political-fiction drama adapted by Walter Bernstein  -one of the numerous talented screenplay writers Hollywood put on the ""black"" list during the fifties- from a best-selling novel.
Sidney Lumet and John Frankenheimer directed in the early sixties some of the most powerful serious movies of the period and FAIL SAFE hasn't lost its impact for the 2001 audience. Contemporary TV networks offer us by the dozens political debates permitting to serious university professors to expose their personal theories about nuclear wars and limited strikes while they enjoy their drinks in the cozyness of the studio. In this perspective, Walter Matthau's character has got an extraordinary prophetic dimension. Just see his apocalyptical show, at the really beginning of FAIL SAFE, in front of an hypnotized audience. Matthau's performance is one to be remembered.
The special edition of this DVD also offers a commentary track recorded by Sydney Lumet as well as a featurette with interviews of Lumet, Bernstein and interesting comparisons between FAIL SAFE and Stanley Kubrick's DR. STRANGELOVE. In my opinion, the tension produced by FAIL SAFE is more powerful than the black humor of Kubrick's movie. You won't feel good after FAIL SAFE's ending.
Henry Fonda is as always exceptional and Larry Hagman's performance -as the translator- very sensible. In short, FAIL SAFE is a must if you are interested in the american film production of the sixties or in good political fictions.

714858,5,6303686745,"Preceded and overshadowed by the film ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Failsafe"" provides a serious version of a nuclear weapons crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The plot in ""Failsafe"" is remarkably similar to its satrical cold-war counterpart with the National Command Authority having to prevent full scale nuclear war after one its bomber squadrons accidentally receives the ""Go"" code to strike Moscow.  A computer communication malfunction at the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command is the culprit, and within minutes, the President dispatches fighters to shoot down the bombers after his service chiefs recommend the course of action.  The fighters are unsuccessful and the President begins working with the Soviet Premier to prevent the bombers from reaching their target.  Under the President's orders, SAC is on line with the Soviet High Command to help intercept the bombers.  After one of his Air Force generals predicts the likelihood of a bomber getting through, the President seeks a solution to prevent nuclear retaliation, which provides a shocking ending to the story.  Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" pulls no punches in its humor and portrayal of high-ranking government officials, its comedic treatment leaves viewers with the feeling that such a scenario would never come to life.  ""Failsafe"" on the other hand projects a chilling atmosphere as the leaders and staffs of two major powers come to grips with the crisis, and overcome their cold-war rivalries to solve the problem.

The story is portrayed in four places; the President's bunker, the Pentagon's operations center, the SAC headquarters, and the cockpit of the flight commander leading his bombers into Russia.  The big star in this feature is Henry Fonda as the President; his performance is so convincing that he probably could have run for office.  Other standouts are Walter Matthau, the civilian advisor who is the ""Devil's Advocate"" on the Pentagon staff, and Dan O'Herlihy as ""Blacky,"" an insightful Air Force general and old friend of the President, who is eventually called upon to carry out the President's solution.  The other significant player is Frank Overton as the SAC Commander, maintaining order in his headquarters while his air staff border on mutiny while assisting the Soviets in locating the bombers.  There is Ed Binns as the bomber pilot, torn between his duties and doubts when the NCA and SAC attempt to recall him over open communication channels.  Last but not least is Larry Hagman, who turns in a great performance as the President's translator.

Included on the DVD is a bonus feature about the production of the movie, where the actors and writers discuss the movie's plot and it's similarity with ""Dr. Strangelove"" that resulted in a lawsuit.  They also talk about having to bootleg footage for the aircraft depicted, because of lack of cooperation from the Air Force, resulting in most of the action represented on graphic display screens in the SAC headquarters and the Pentagon.  Despite these constraints, they produced a movie that still puts viewers on the edge of their seats as time runs out with the bombers getting closer and closer to their target.  The impact of the feature was enough to warrant a special message in the end credits to assure audiences that such an event could never occur.",981676800,92,3333,5.153988868274583
714859,5,6303686745,"Most books, even the great ones, unfortunately do not translate well onto the big screen.  Fail Safe is a happy exception to the rule.
The story is now two generations old.  Mechanical error sends six bombers towards the Soviet Union (remember them?  they used to be our one mortal national enemy).  The President and the government try all they can to recall them, to no avail.
Emotions understandibly run high.  Men get stretched to the breaking point, and some snap.  The President makes a terrible sacrifice, to convince the Russians that it WAS an accident.  The price of this ticket it incredibly high.
Forget about the comparisons with Dr. Strangelove (which is a great movie in its own right).  They belong together only by their contrasting styles.
This movie is chilling in Black & White.  You will never think of J.R. Ewing again the same way, after seeing Larry Hagman in the role as the President's translator.",974592000,76,923,4.828025477707007

The complete lack of music, the hard cuts (no fades), the long, painful close-ups on Henry Fonda, the long silences in the dialog, give this film a stunning verisimilitude, and make it far more absorbing that it might have otherwise been.

Henry Fonda provides a superb performance in this powerful drama which keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very last image on the screen. The tension unfolds minute by minute following the ill-fated crew from the beginning of their routine flight to their terror-filled battle through Soviet airspace towards their target - Moscow! Will they succeed, will they be recalled, will they be shot down? Superb acting and skillful writing combine to produce one of the best (anti) cold war films of our time.
Special effects are minimal (compared to todays epics) and the sets are confined mostly to the NORAD Air Force control bunker and the bomber cockpit but never has a film been so effective in its powerful portrayal of tension, suspense, and fear as the President of the United States, the US Air Force and the Russians struggle to try to stop the rogue bomber from starting a nuclear holocaust.

Sure the  USA Army possess now the best machines, but as in this film, all these  doesn't calm very much, because this ""Fail Safe"" is mainly human.  Yes there's a fail in the communications, but these safety system has been  previously conceived by men which knew such possibilities of error, for  that this movie is very credible and frightful, and beyond all these, one  can see that if electronics and computers rigth now are much more powerful  and reliable, curiously it would be difficult to find so superb actors  rigth now as in this film. Not only Henry Fonda and Walter Mattau, but all  secondary characters are really  extraordinary so, one can ask himself if  politics and military people of today also are as good and are improved as  war technology  has done.

714910,4,6303686745,"Fail Safe has often been unfairly compared to Dr. Strangelove, and as a result has not gotten the attention is deserves as a film.  And it deserves attention as a film with superior performances, outstanding twists, and  chillingly claustrophobic presentation.
The plot, from Eugene Burdick and  Harvey Wheeler's 1962 novel, is straightforward; an unidentified aircraft  is picked up on NORAD radar and causes the Strategic Air Command to send  bombers to fixed orbiting points near Russia, called Fail Safe points.  When the UFO is identified as an off-course airliner, the bombers are  recalled.  But a blown fault indicator at SAC HQ in Omaha necessitates  replacement; this causes a power surge that activates one bomber group's  automatic attack signal.  Making matters worse, the Russians jam the  group's radios, leaving the crew convinced that war has broken out, and  forced to carry out their operational order; incinerate Moscow.
The sheer  excellence of the cast - Dan O'Herlihy, Walter Matthau, Edward Binns, Frank  Overton, Fritz Weaver in his film debut, Sorrell Booke, Henry Fonda, Larry  Hagman, and so forth; Dom DeLuise gives a magnificent performance in his  brief role as an Air Force Sergeant forced to reveal secret information to  the Russians to help them stop the attacking bombers - the chilling B&W  photography, and Sidney Lumet's direction help the film overcome several  weaknesses in the script.  The biggest weakness comes in the film's ending;  the President agrees to incinerate New York City in the event that Moscow  is destroyed, which works as drama but contains zero plausibility.  Also  hurting the film is its portrayal of Pentagon advisor Professor Groteschele  (Matthau), who comes off as an utterly bloodthirsty case of  insanity.
Then there are the subtle hints of a moral equivalency written  into the story, an equivalency that never existed between the US and USSR.  ""You have the same equipment we do!""""They (Russian SAMs)  are no different from ours, sir.""""We have computers, like  yours.""  Basically the film treats both superpowers as equally guilty  and equally innocent of the disaster that befalls them.  It would be a much  better film had it been more honest in pointing out that the US and USSR  never were moral equals.
But such quibbles should not detract from the  sheer power of the film's presentation.  The nuclear threat has not quite  evaporated with the collapse of Soviet Russia, so the film still retains a  relevancy that adds to its brilliance as drama.",928713600,9,2525,5.153465346534653
