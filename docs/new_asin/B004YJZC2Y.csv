8448405,3,B004YJZC2Y,"This is a really good intermediate practice and it's about 40 minutes in length, which for me is perfect.  I want more than a 20 minute practice but less than an hour, so this hits my sweet spot.  The flow sequencing is good and is organized in a way that makes sense.  That said, I'm not a fan of Molly Fox.  Her cueing is decent and relatively easy to follow, but the rest of her commentary is annoying.  She sighs and says ""yeah"" multiple times.  She says weird things like, ""Let your head hang, like a big ol' coconut"" and ""let your kidneys float"".  Am I not supposed to use the restroom before doing this?  I'm not sure what she's talking about there.  Her whole ""pick me, really!"" when doing camel drives me nuts and ruins any zen I've achieved.  The first time I popped this into the DVD player, her singing at the end really startled me while I was trying to practice my meditation.  Now I know enough to keep the remote next to my mat so I can hit the mute button.  If there were a way to mute Molly Fox except for the cues that have to do with pose transitioning, I would give this DVD five stars.",1488067200,,1107,4.169811320754717
8448406,5,B004YJZC2Y,"Great variety of different yoga poses, nicely paced vinyasa flow sequences balanced with deep stretching and a perfect running time of about 40 minutes.",1384041600,,152,5.375
8448407,5,B004YJZC2Y,"I have never heard of Molly Fox, but bought this DVD on a whim because of the positive reviews on this site.  I like to do yoga after work and before dinner, so I search out practices in the 40-50 minute range.  This can be a challenge as the majority of recent offerings either seem to be either the 20 minute ""yoga lite"" variety, or ""serious"" practices that are over an hour long.  This one at just over 40 minutes fills that bill perfectly.  The practice flows very well. Molly Fox is down to earth and friendly, and cues very clearly.  I would describe both the difficulty and the intensity level of this practice as ""medium"".  I like that she manages to get your heart rate up without resorting to endless repetitions of the sun salutations.  I also love love love the pigeon series.  The practice is well-balanced in terms of working all parts of the body, with emphasis on toning the lower body and stretching the hips (presumably explaining the skinny jeans reference).  I find myself reaching for this video again and again, because it never fails to make me feel calm and energized at the end of the day.",1383782400,3,1114,4.502487562189055
8448408,5,B004YJZC2Y,"I really enjoyed Molly Fox's Skinny Jeans Deep Flow Yoga.  This was differnt from the other more athletic Yoga DVDs that I have because it was slower, and more thoughtful.  Throughout the DVD, you can tell that Molly Fox is really enjoying herself and urging you on to get the most that you can from this practice.  I want to enjoy this as much as she obviously is.  Molly moves at a slow pace so that you really feel all the poses.

The one criticism that I have is that I felt I needed more of a warm up before beginning this practice.  She begins doing a one leg split just a couple of minutes into the practice.  Since I normally exercise as soon as I wake up, I am still stiff, and need a longer warm up before being able to raise my legs high.  Nonetheless I really enjoyed the routine.

I have been practicing Yoga regularly about a year.",1347926400,,845,4.198757763975156
8448409,5,B004YJZC2Y,"I received this video as a gift and was hesitant,  thinking that if I'm supposed to get into a pair of skinny jeans, this workout is going to hurt.  It doesn't hurt at all, in fact the workout and stretches were wonderful.  I suffer from chronic pain in my back, neck and hips and this work out helped me loosen up.  I'm sure I will sleep better because of it.  I love Molly, she is so present and explains with simplicity and elegance.
Namaste",1320624000,,444,4.238095238095238
8448410,5,B004YJZC2Y,"loved it- 40 minutes goes fast, i paused to get water and move my limbs into the correct poses from time to time or review the instructions or even enjoy a vinyasa sequence at my own pace since she does go through them quick in spots shes very good though, i hadnt done a Molly Fox workout before this one, and this isn't for absolute beginners unless you are able to watch the screen for every move! still i've only been back to yoga for 7 months now and i found it challenging and defintately brought different poses into my workout plan, and i hope you like it and you end up with a satisfied i did it ha! feeling! that i have now, its a good balance of a workout i worked up a sweat but its summer so its warm in here,  and i'm glad i added it to my collection, thanks to the other reviewers i'm glad i gave it a chance!",1311379200,2,824,3.993939393939394
8448411,5,B004YJZC2Y,"I must say that this practice is my first exposure to Molly Fox as I'd never heard of her before.  I consider myself an advanced beginner/low intermediate yogini and a bit of a yoga purist at that so you can only imagine how I felt even entertaining the idea of purchasing a ""Skinny Jeans"" workout, but it was a clip of the practice that initially sold me.

Surprisingly, this is one deep, solid practice.  Molly's demeanor and instruction is spot on, and you can tell she has expertise in instructing yoga students.  Even though I have over 120 pieces of yoga media from all types of instructors, I was pleasantly surprised to find some unique gems of instruction from Molly that really helped me to go deeper into the postures.  And deeper you will go as this practice involves some long-ish holds, quite different from the usual power yoga fare.  And don't let the ""Skinny Jeans"" title fool you; this is traditional yoga done very well but no worries, she won't inundate you with sanskrit terminology.

It starts off nicely in a seated posture, working its way into some lovely cat/cow stretches, then progressing on to some serious strengthening postures and balancing poses, moreso than what you'd typically find on a yoga dvd.  Eventually she takes you down to the floor for backbending and seated twists, ending in a nice savasana.

I was sweating during the strengthening and balancing poses but then thoroughly stretched and relaxed by the conclusion.  The 40-minute time length makes this a perfect practice, and did I mention how AMAZING the music is?  This is a great practice from Molly Fox and is now ranked in my top 5 favorite and most used yoga dvds thus far.  The only thing that would make this dvd better for me is if she produces more.

This practice is perfect for all levels as it will provide some challenge to beginners but also help to continue to build strength and flexibility for more experienced practitioners.",1309219200,9,1940,4.738095238095238
8448412,4,B004YJZC2Y,"really enjoyed this yoga dvd. I had been hesitant to try it because it was rated as beginner and I am a high intermediate/advanced exerciser. However, I did today because I had already done my hard workout. I really liked it. It is about 35 minutes of exercising and a relaxation period at the end which includes her singing in a different language.

There are no chapters so you must play the whole workout. The workout is instructed live rather than via voiceover. The exercises included include: downward dog, upward dog, downward 3 dog, standing dog split, chair, warrior 1, warrior 2, warrior 3, wide angled forward bend, very minimal charatrungas, upward dog, side angle, pigeon, bow, camel, happy baby pose, and supine spine twist. There are interesting variations like downward dog with feet closed and a pose to the side with one foot on its side and the other curved behind (sort of Shiva Rea-ish). She does hold some of the poses for longer than some dvds. She uses a block for some of the poses. Poses not included: tree, crow, bridge, boat, eagle, shoulder stands, and wheel.",1308182400,7,1088,4.756613756613756
8448413,5,B004YJZC2Y,"I love this yoga video because it showcases Molly Fox's strengths as a yoga teacher.  The video begins with a gentle warm up and quickly moves into an active yoga routine, drawing together several intermediate poses that are both invigorating and grounding.  Beginners can certainly use the video and will be able to grow into it.  Intermediate yogis will benefit hugely from Molly's attention to technical form which teaches balance by staying rooted in the feet, deep awareness of proper alignment, as well as full body strengthening and lengthening.",1307145600,2,552,5.179775280898877
