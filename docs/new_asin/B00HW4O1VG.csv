6233418,1,B00HW4O1VG,Absolutely the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  Soft porn parading as art and an absurd ending as well,1393286400,8,108,4.142857142857143
6233419,5,B00HW4O1VG,"On a beach at a secluded lake in the French countryside, a group of men, largely anonymous, spend their summer vacations sunning themselves, sizing up one another, and then retiring to the woods to consummate their hunger. There is a sameness to the days with the same cars arriving each morning, unloading the same faces in the same places to participate in the same rituals: its surprising that theres any anonymity left at all. In Alain Guiraudie's new film, ""L'Inconnu du Lac"" (""Stranger By the Lake""), our hero, the youthful Franck (a nominal hero, if the truth be known) arrives at the lake intending to cruise, flirt and have a lot of sex. In spite of his appalling naivete (displayed later), this is not Francks first time at the rodeo, a point made clear by the affection with which he greets some of the naked sunbathers. And then, things begin to happen that disrupt the jovially uninhibited sameness of the beach. When handsome, mustachioed Michel arrives, with his lover in tow, Franck is immediately smitten. And so, apparently, is Michel. Before you know it, a sunset romp in the lake turns into murder as Michel dispatches his lover with the casual irritability he might swat a fly. Franck, for his part, has just finished a romp in the bushes and, still dawdling around in the woods, looks down to the lake below and witnesses the murder. While horrified, Franck is not, unfortunately, horrified enough to alert the police; he is, in fact, not horrified enough to resist having copious sex in the following days with the newly single Michel, either. When the body is found and the police come calling, Franck lies, claiming he didn't see a thing that night in the woods. And then one lie begets another and then another, while one murder inevitably begets more. Meanwhile, Franck thinks hes falling in love, and the greater the danger, the more uncontrollable his desire for Michel becomes. Francks moral dilemma is palpable, and aptly conveyed through Pierre de Ladonchamps subtle and sensitive performance. Looking quite a lot like American actor, James Franco, Ladonchamps is both soulful and sexy in a role that demands a lot from the viewer. In the end, its difficult to be too hard on Franck, even though his lies cause even more death and destruction at the lake; hes such a likable, well-meaning, foolish man that you keep hoping that hell come to his senses before he, too, becomes a victim. As Michel, Christophe Paou, is lethally handsome; moving about the woods like a panther on the prowl, hes predatory and hypnotic, a dangerous creature who engages everyone he meets in dangerous dances of sex or death (and sometimes both).  If this sounds like something Hitchcock might cook up, that's because it is, vaguely, had Hitchcock populated his film with horny, naked gay men who spend most of the film carousing in various couplings throughout the woods surrounding the lake.

Director Alain Guiraudie must be commended for this suspenseful, evenly-paced thriller. It's well-conceived, well-thought out, and very daring, for which the cast must also be commended (due to the explicit nature of the nudity and sex, the film has been construed as pornographic by some groups, which I guess could be the case, but only in the shallowest application of the word).  The photography is absolutely stunning: even though the entire film is centered around one small area of the lake, it is shot to look like a gorgeous postcard. The two lead actors, also, are filmed to maximum advantage and their eventual pairings in the woods are genuinely erotic (though tinged with an edge of dread as things progress).

""Stranger By the Lake"" certainly isn't a movie for everyone, but I can't imagine that the homophobes, the deeply religious, the easily offended or even Mom and Dad on a date night will be lining up to see it. However, certain segments of the gay community aren't going to be happy about it, either, especially if they don't know what they're getting into. Those intent on trying to project a gay image of everyone being comparable to say, the couple on ""Modern Family"", are going to be sorely disappointed, probably even outraged, because ""Stranger By the Lake"" is the very antithesis of that kind of thinking. Thank God! Despite the subject matter, the rampant nudity and promiscuity, this movie is like a breath of fresh air!",1393200000,7,4356,4.874493927125506
6233420,5,B00HW4O1VG,"...it probably would look something like this. This is a striking film that just has catapulted director Alain Guiraudie into the front ranks of world cinema. Whether he will stay there only time will tell, but he has just made everyone pay attention with this work. An award winner at Cannes, voted the best film of 2013 by the Cahiers du Cinema, it is a diabolical delight contrasting a formalist technique with a deeply unsettling storyline.

A man thinks he sees a murder committed at a gay cruising spot. Unlike James Stewart, who is in an analogous predicament in ""Rear Window"", the witness starts dating the suspect. Complications ensue.

Sexually explicit, psychologically disturbing and with a closing image that will haunt you for days, this is a startlingly original film that is not for the faint of heart. But it is also one you are unlikely to forget.",1392422400,28,865,4.837837837837838

6233526,2,B00HW4O1VG,"This movie is disturbing and ridiculous.  It's not the sex and nudity scenes (and there are plenty scenes some graphic enough to make a porn star blush).  It's the ridiculous plot they have thrown in to make the movie not a porn flick.  The movie centers around Franck.  He visits the lake frequently in search for having sex in the forest surrounding the beach.  On one such day he witness a murder (drowning) while hiding behind some trees.  Does young Franck scream or try to stop the murder?  Does he run and get help?  Nope.  He watches the entire murder and then stares at the naked murderer as he comes out of the water.  In fact young
Franck is attracted to the murder and develops a quick sexual relationship with him.  Even after Michel tells him he doesn't feel bad for killing the guy he goes on to murder Henri, a man Franck has befriended and an inspector investigating the drowning murder.  Even after all of this Franck is stil madly in love with the now serial killer Michel.  I didn't buy a minute of it.  The point of the movie is highly disturbing.  The movie seems to be saying that some people are so good looking that they can and should get away with murder.",1487462400,,1182,4.407407407407407

6233741,5,B00HW4O1VG,"As I finish Stranger by the Lake, all I can think to myself is one thing.

This is a film that is so un-American and would never see the light of day in this country, and thats why I love it.

In a country that just saw a major film studio winning a bidding war with two other film studios for the rights to an emoij film, one really has to look to other countries to create films that go for something that hasn't been done before or that won't test well with twelve women in the midst of a midlife crisis that were picked out of a JC Pennys inside of your local shopping mall.

Stranger by the Lake is certainly that film. Its an erotic thriller filled with more shots of penises and gay sex than some of the darkest corners of the internet. It also is a slow burner that doesnt cater to those who whine about allegedly suffering from ADD. The ending may also be seen as unsatisfactory to those who need every detail spoon fed to them and are only satisfied from over explanatory films such as Whos Next.

Being a cinefile who is somewhat disgusted living in a country that creates two hundred million dollar blockbusters without any homosexual characters so it plays well in China, Stranger by the Lake satisfied me more than I ever thought a film made in this day and age could.",1438300800,,1282,4.285123966942149

We see an ejaculating penis, a sexual position with a number as its name, and positions I did not know were possible. This is gay porn with the flimsiest of a story line woven in between sex scenes. I have seen porn movies with more of a plot.

Both of us are very open-minded. The sex did not offend us at all. What did bother us was the complete lack of a viable plot and the unfortunate absence of suspense when it was called for. Some call this Hitchcockian? I am going to resist making a play on words.

6233864,2,B00HW4O1VG,"I kept expecting this to have some strange twist, but it was pretty straightforward re: Having an insatiable attraction to someone even when you know they are capable of murder. Franck does just that, falls for (the French version of Tom Selleck) Michel.  I never quite understood why Franck has this fatal attraction to Michel (or vice versa). And perhaps that was the director/writer's intention. It certainly helped keep the atmosphere somewhat ominous (and the  ending is purposefully ambiguous as another more definitive ending was shot, then discarded per IMDB).  The most interesting character, however, is Henri, an unattractive, overweight stranger whom Franck befriends.  There's so much going on with his character. Is he gay? Bi-curious? What was his final action all about?

Yes, it takes place at a gay cruising area, yes there's a ton of male nudity and two X-rated quick cuts of  explicit sexual activity. But the story is a pretty much the basic  falling in love  with someone you know is rotten to the core, but you fall for them anyway. And the ambiguous ending let's the viewer decide what will be the outcome of that decision.",1414368000,,1147,4.968586387434555

Beautiful male bodies, shaved genitalia, rampant nudity (It occurs in a French version of what we call a meat-rack), and unsimulated copulation. But there is a serpent in this gay garden of pleasures: a serial killer who is identified at the very beginning of the movie and succeeds in killing three of the beach goers,with a fourth possible murder, that of the man who has fallen in love with him AFTER having watched the first crime. And therein lies the problem: no costumes, no staging, no real plot, no background music, practically no dialogue. Even nude male bodies can become totally boring after a while.  Now let's talk ideology.  I have violently opposed films that reaffirm heterosexual stereotypes of gays, and films where killers get away with their crime.  This one falls into both categories.

The one reviewer who was obsessed with the lack of pubic hair, minus that observation had an interesting review (I didn't even notice the lack of it). There were many other interesting reviews. The best of those were by people who made critical points that were not a reflection of their personal biases. In watching any movie I think it's better to view it for what it is; representing a directors vision. I viewed it as a set piece that reflects what goes on in real life. It's a fact that there is cruising in wooded areas in public bathrooms, etc. by people who just like sex 24/7 and there are also some who just like to watch and of course there are lonely people who have a need to be around others even if they have no actual interaction with them. I also didn't consider it pornographic, another bad label, at all or particularly a gay movie (it's really past time to stop using labels in describing books or films about human nature). The only thing that could have probably been left out is the visual representation of the orgasm but that is a personal preference and people really do have them in real life (hopefully)!",1408838400,,1274,4.51948051948052
6233930,4,B00HW4O1VG,"Alain Guiraudie's film is highly disturbing, not so much for its frank portrayal of sexuality or in the violence of its ending, but rather in its representation of human imprisonment.  The title is deliberately ambiguous: at the beginning of the film we think that straight man Henri (Patrick d'Assumao) is the stranger by the lake, as he comes every to sit on his own, looking out across the lake without participating in any of the couplings that preeocupy all the other visitors.  Although striking up a friendship with Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps), he always seems a lonely, alienated figre.  As the action unfolds, however, we come to understand that every single man who comes to bathe by the lake is a stranger; their lives are strangely disconnected, dominated by cruising and casual affairs.  Any attempt to develop a love-affair any further is rejected, especially by Franck's lover Michel (Christophe Paou).  Structurally speaking, THE STRANGER ON THE LAKE comprises a series of repetitive shots of automobiles parked close to the lake, interspersed with shots of the lake itself and the bathers undertaking their daily rituals.  The situation seems positively idyllic, but in this film it is represented as a form of imprisonment.  No one, it seems, can give vent to their feelings; they can only participate in the accepted rituals.  Hence Henri represents something of a subversive force - even though he doesn't actually do anything.  Love in this film has been reduced to a series of casual affairs between strangers.  The dialog is spare, almost inconsequential; the shooting-style slow, comprised of long takes; both of these cinematic strategies help to reinforce the confining natre of this world: no one says anything of any consequence (to do so would be dangerous), and no one ever does anything different.  Repetition equals security; unexpected movement - as symbolized through fast cutting - is a threat to the order of this world.  STRANGER BY THE LAKE is a powerful film, beautifully shot and performed.",1408492800,,2032,5.142857142857143

The director and cameraman seem obsessed with the same shot of wind blowing through the trees. The same trees, the same wind. Lazy. Only one character is symapathetic and he becomes a victim.

You have to be comfortable sitting through those scenes or you aren't going to enjoy the movie. Not that the movie is intending to be gratuitous; the scenes are integral to the plot. (Not to mention, this is a French flick and not American. We American are prudish about our sex, our male frontal nudity, and our  male on male sex.) Having said all that, if you don't mind, then I'd say wholeheartedly, enjoy ""Strangers By The Lake.""

""Strangers"" centers around a group of nude men who cruise each other at a lake, almost daily. One young man develops an infatuation with another, and even when he sees the object of his affection murder someone, the infatuation remains unabated.

Their relationship quickly becomes sexual and our protagonist yearns for it to become romantic.

The movie is more drama than mystery; yet it is oddly suspenseful. You'll find yourself questioning the motives (and the state-of-mind) of the protagonist, all the while worried as to how things will turn out - should the object of his affection realize they share a secret.

If you need a resolution for your movies, you like things wrapped in a pretty bow, then this movie isn't for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy interpreting the ending, then go sit by this lake.

Summer time. A cruising spot for gay men seeking nameless sexual encounters is tucked away on the shores of a picturesque secluded lake in rural France.

Franck has witnessed this first hand, but his desire for Michel knows no bounds, this is a relationship he must have - at any cost.

STRANGER BY THE LAKE is a tense thriller set against the secluded back drop of, what becomes inevitably, the most dangerous lake in France.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: In STRANGER BY THE LAKE [French: L'Inconnu Du Lac], a suspense thriller from the French director Alain Guiraudie, we get the measure of the lake itself soon enough. It's a wide, chalky basin somewhere in the south of France, with water as hot and blue as a June sky. It's also a gay pick-up spot, where men sunbathe, swim and chat, before disappearing into the surrounding scrub.

This mesmerising feature from French writer-director Alain Guiraudie is a mix of Hitchcockian potboiler and queer-culture study. Our lead is buff Franck [Pierre Deladonchamps], who struts with confidence around the lake that is the film's only location. Franck becomes fast friends with lonely, obese Henri [Patrick d'Assumao], but his libido is more tickled by '70s-porn-moustache-sporting Michel [Christophe Paou]. Guiraudie has a keen eye for queer conduct: he spends most of the first half hour acclimating us to this Eden where gay men lie around nude and sneak off into the woods for sex, before offering a deeply unsettling exploration of infatuation.

This provocative setting is ideal for Alain Guiraudie's story, which is an exploration of fear and longing, and the ways in which those two seemingly opposing forces often work in deadly unison. The men here are essentially strangers, but at the same time they're hair-raisingly intimate, and their encounters are shown in explicit detail. The BBFC report warns of ""strong, real sex"" and we aren't disappointed, on either count. The film leans a bit heavily on long takes, but there's a purpose to Alain Guiraudie's rigorous perspective. He's out to unearth the powerful, often terrifying emotions which underlay all explicit acts, sexual or not.

One of the regulars is Franck [Pierre Deladonchamps], a limber youngster, who notes one morning the arrival of a new man, Michel [Christophe Paou], who has a cruel smile, a thick moustache, and the physique of an Olympic swimmer. Franck is intrigued, and lingers in the bushes that evening to spy on him playing in the water with a third man who appears to be a romantic partner. As Franck comes to learn, death and love make consummate bedfellows.

What happens next could be considered a plot-spoiler, so I won't detail it here, although Alain Guiraudie captures it in an unbroken, indelible four-minute shot, where the action moves from the far distance to the foreground while the camera looks on with a paralysed steadiness worthy of Hitchcock.

Franck's response to what he sees is complex: from an earlier conversation about contraception, we already know that sex and risk are closely aligned in his psyche. Two days later, he strikes up a relationship with Michel. The day after that, a police inspector comes to ask questions about what may or may not have happened that night, and the lake's status as a set-apart place, with its own opaque codes of maleness, comes under threat.

Alain Guiraudie's film is acutely brilliant on the funny, scary machinery of desire, and how easily humans can get caught up in its cogwheels. There are no female characters and the camera never leaves the lakeside, but despite the picture's resolute closed-offness, the gist is universal. It's categorically not for the faint-hearted, but the good ones never are.

Blu-ray Video Quality  With its 1080p brilliant encoded transfer, STRANGER BY THE LAKE is one of the best-looking discs to come from Peccadillo Pictures. While most of this likely has to do with the fact the the film premiered in 2013, it shouldn't take anything away from how strikingly detailed and consistent the image actually is. Much of the film takes place during bright summer days, and the image captures the essence of the setting with tremendous amounts of detail. One can practically count the rocks on the beach, if they were so inclined. Additionally, facial features and other textures are all on display and though clothing is something of a rarity for this film. Colours are consistently vivid, and manage to capture the bright lushness of the lake's surrounding woods. Contrast remains incredibly high throughout the film producing full-bodied black levels and whites that never look overblown. Certain night scenes do tend to take on an overwhelming inkiness, but that seems to be deliberate on behalf of the filmmaker, as it adds a great deal to the tension of the situation. All in all, this is a fantastic looking disc that rarely has a misstep of any kind. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix is also quite good. The mix isn't tasked with doing much other than making sure the dialogue is clean and easily heard which it does with great ease here. The sound is primarily loaded through the front, as dialogue spills through the centre channel while various ambient effects are filtered through the front and rear channels as needed. There's little that is obvious about the mix, so sounds are generally floating between channels, generating an effortless immersive experience that highlights the sounds of the lake, the breeze blowing through the tall grass, and the voices of the eternally present others floating around the background. This is a quiet film that makes pointed use of every bit of dialogue and sound effect, so that they are distinct and purposeful. It's not going to be used as reference for anyone's next demo, but it certainly goes above and beyond in terms of setting the tone of a wonderful film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Interview with Alain Guiraudie [Director] [2013] [1080p] [16:32] Alain Guiraudie is recorded at the 2013 Melbourne Film Festival. The director is extremely prepared to chat up ""Stranger by the Lake,"" delving into a sophisticated explanation of his moviemaking approach, with emphasis on theory, form, and inspiration. While more textured anecdotes are more inviting. Alain Guiraudie displays a rich understanding of his work, sharing his creative intent with authority in this passionate conversation that's punctuated with clips from the feature. French Language with English Subtitles.

Special Feature: Interview with Christophe Paou and Pierre Deladonchamps [2013] [1080p] [30:15] Here we get a chance to get an in-depth intimate interview with the two main character actors. We get to hear the actors explaining all aspect of the film and how they went about creating their characters. What was so refreshing is how very frank they were when it came to the sex scenes and held nothing back. What was also really nice and surprising is that they wanted to only speak in English, which is sometimes very rare, but of course they both have very heavy French accents, which were really nice, but most surprising of all, is that both actors are completely straight.

Special Feature: The Cannes Premire [2013] [1080p] [16:33] this is a short documentary, showing all aspects of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival event. You get short interviews with different people involved with the film, plus small extracts from the film, with people explaining in depth of what is happening in that particular part of the film. The main part of this short documentary is with everyone on the Cannes Stage and the Director making short speeches, as well as seeing the audience appreciating all the people involved with the film who attended the premire. French Language with English Subtitles.

Special Feature: Creating The Poster: Commentary by Roy Genty [Artistic Director] [2013] [1080p] [6:42] Here we get to hear Roy Genty explain how he went about designing the different Film Posters, and how he eventually came to designing the actual poster advertising the film. French Language with English Subtitles.

Special Feature: 3 Deleted Scenes [2013] [1080p] [4:19] here we get three additional moments focusing on Franck's adventures around the lake, interacting with Henri and being chased away by other men in the area. The final scene is perhaps most important, spotlighting a discussion of protected sex between Franck and a more attentive conquest that should've remained in the picture. French Language. English Subtitles.

Special Feature: Alternative Ending [2013] [1080p] [9:20] presents two takes that essentially extend the theatrical ending to a more defined resolution, while still preserving needed ambiguity. This is only a subtle change, but it does alter the tone of the climax, gifting the feature a more sombre quality. French Language with English Subtitles.

Special Feature: BFI London Film Festival Gala Q&A [2013] [1080p] [14:14] Here we get to see the 3 main actors and the Director [speaking only in French]. You also have 2 other people on the stage speaking in English. One of them was a woman who had to translate into English what the Director was explaining, especially from specific questions from the audience, which unfortunately you can't quite hear what they are saying.

Finally, although certain elements of STRANGER BY THE LAKE suggest it might fit into the subgenre of homoerotic. As to the film itself, is more concerned with the idea of a subgenre itself, or, in this case a small microcosm like the populated by the men gathering at the lake for bouts of passionate, anonymous sex. For the film to also feature a compelling thriller aspect seems to suggest that Alain Guiraudie is also interested in examining what constitutes desire, especially when it becomes unquenchable, reckless, and even illogical. This is very captivating film, that features terrific picture, very good sound, and a host of informative extras that gives a glimpse into the mind of the director. This is a definite high octane tour-de-force gay film, that was so amazingly good, which has a refreshing no holds barred action, and whose characters are fascinating to watch and get into their characters and is definitely for repeat view and I am so pleased to add this to my ever extensive Blu-ray Collection and is also a must buy, if you want to see something really different and keeps you guessing right to the very end, then this is the Blu-ray disc for you. Highly Recommended!

6234072,5,B00HW4O1VG,"Ok, this film is not for everyone. It is heavy on sex and sexuality, but it's not pornographic. It's just, well, International, where there is greater lee-way with nudity and sex than you will ever find in this country.

The storyline is straightforward, though the progress and outcome is far from predictable. The acting was excellent and the filming was superb!

This is the kind of movie where you watch it, not sure what to expect from moment to moment. At the end, it begs for just sitting there, reflecting on the complexity of human psychology. Here, you will find threads of attachment, abandonment, obsessive-compulsiveness, compartmentalization, desire, and lust.

This is not a movie for kids and teens, of course. Even the adult men and women who watch it, however, should have the capacity for seeing beyond the sex and not being uncomfortable with blatant man-on-man sexuality. If you get hung up on that part of it, you'll miss the beauty and message of this movie.",1402704000,3,981,4.897590361445783

I gave it three stars mainly because I don't really understand the ending.  The main character's love for the murderer seems to be quite toxic, maybe along the lines of Bonny's love for Clyde.  That is something I don't understand in real life much less in a movie.  However, I would still recommend this movie, especially for people who like gay-themed movies.

6234079,1,B00HW4O1VG,"Stranger by the Lake describes the collection of characters, tromping through the high grasses, making merry.  I think this movie should have been given a more apt title, like: You've Seen This Movie Before...The Gay Guy Did It.  If I'm to assume the point of this movie lies beyond voyeuristic titillation, [SPOILER] then the killer wasn't the only stranger by the Lake who behaved most strange.  He kills his boyfriend/sex partner for what reason?  We, the audience, never quite know for sure.  So, can we assume he --the killer, was just another one of those maladjusted, knife toting homosexuals seen in so many movies who dislikes true intimacy but craves lots of public sex?  Can we also assume, the murder victim deserved to be killed because he exhibited the one possessive behavior worthy of death, wanting not to share his man with other men?

The lead character, who witnesses the murder, seizes the opportunity of violent death and dates the murderer...sort of.  They have a lot of sex and the lead character wants more, but the killer has some standards.  He's apparently fine with having public sex (except he objects when an onlooker wants to watch) but anything more than sex is sordid and worthy of execution.  I mean, it's one thing to have sex with a guy but have dinner with him in a restaurant where others could witness two guys eating food and not each other; well, that's just gross.

Finding a good man must be difficult, because the bar is set quite low...killers are acceptable as long as they want to cuddle on the couch.  We didn't get to know any of the characters.  I couldn't believe the denouement of events.  A disappointing romp into the familiar assassination of the homosexual...to be gay means you should be killed on film.

6234122,4,B00HW4O1VG,"After all the advance word about the explicit sex and nudity, the film does not disappoint at all when it comes to either one. This is the 2014 version of a 70s porno, complete with Marloboro man mustaches, sex in the wild, French subtitles, and a vague plot.  It's hard not to bring up the constant amount of hookups and exposed frontal shots throughout.  The audiences may as well be the uroligist of the lead character Frank because we know what his shaved taint and hole look like.  Yes, that explicit.

In terms of what the movie is about, if you even care after hearing all that, Frank witnesses a murder of a young twink by the Marloboro man, with whom he's had a crush on for days. Instead of reporting it to the police, they start to hookup every day, as the police investigation surrounding the disapperance of the kid heats up.

It's not a total sexathon, and there's an odd set of conversations between Frank and a leering bear type who purposely sits away from everyone else. That relationship isn't very clear.  Just like other movies about wanton sex, things start to go bad.  How could they not with a murderer?  I'm sure I'll fire up this film again for the eye candy, but like a lot of French films, it's trying really hard to be about something about the human condition, so be prepared to think and ogle at the same time.

6234126,3,B00HW4O1VG,Hitchcockian would imply a sense of suspense of which there is very little. Glacially paced but with some wonderful performances and a haunting last shot.,1401321600,3,154,5.2
6234127,4,B00HW4O1VG,"Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps) spends the summer frequenting an all-male nude beach where men come to sunbathe and to engage in casual sex in the woods nearby. One quiet evening, he secretly witnesses a man, Michel (Christophe Paou), whom he briefly met earlier in the day, drown another young man, perhaps his lover, in the lake. Despite this knowledge, Franck finds himself so intensely and inexplicably drawn to the killer that he establishes a relationship and quickly begins falling in love with him.

Laced with highly-charged erotic undertones, ""Stranger By the Lake"" is a low-keyed, multi-leveled thriller whose dark and disturbing themes simmer beneath a deceptively simple surface. The sex is certainly graphic in its depiction - no simulation going on here, folks - but it is germane to the storytelling and integral to the theme.

Written and directed by Alain Guiraudie, this psycho-sexual chiller achieves an uber-creepy tone without resorting to a single clich associated with the overworked genre. Heck, there isn't even any music to helpfully alert us to the story's moments of greatest intensity. The movie creates suspense through the observation of character rather than through overt action or violence, with the placidity of the setting placed in stark relief against the grimness of the crime.

Except for the fact that it's in color, ""Stranger By the Lake"" has much of the look and feel of an early Michelangelo Antonioni film, what with its languid pacing, the artful minimalism of its shots, and the obliqueness of its storytelling and characters. In fact, what's most disturbing about the characters is their seemingly utter detachment not only from the society around them but from their own emotions and any semblance of a moral code. They seem to float freely about in a world of their own making, one in which they live only for the absorption of the moment and in which they are cut off completely from any meaningful human connection. In a way, casual sex is merely an external manifestation of the much more serious underlying condition of angst and alienation (a favorite theme of Antonioni's work, in fact) that's come to define their mode of living and, by extension, much of modern society itself. But is it really possible for an individual to remain that detached from everyone and everything, or is that just a pose designed to keep us from having to actively engage in life with all its attended complications and messiness?

Guiraudie raises the question, then leaves it up to the audience to come up with its own answer. For that is the way with ""Stranger By the Lake."" It disturbs us in so many different ways, while at the same time refusing to spoon-feed us or to play to our expectations as so many movies routinely do. It assumes that we are mature enough to handle both its raw sexuality and its super-dark vision of the world. And, for that alone, any true movie-lover should be immensely grateful.",1401062400,16,2948,4.94949494949495
6234128,2,B00HW4O1VG,"Started off interesting, but advanced to really weird near the end of the movie. In the trailer it was compared to Hitchcock, but in my humble opinion it was not even in the same league.

I have no problem with subtitles, but this film lacked continuity and purpose to keep me wanting to bond with any of the lead characters.

This film was more strange than it was compelling and was not inline with my expectations established from watching the trailer.",1400976000,5,455,4.604938271604938
6234129,5,B00HW4O1VG,"The plot is very different, but I can't help think of Hitchcock's The Rope. This film is so unique, I felt compelled to review it even though I viewed it through a different outlet. What makes a man so attractive, so compelling that one is willing to overlook murder to posses him? It's not love but that extreme attraction, lust even, that draws one to him. This film is compelling, sexy, even explicit at times. There is a lake with a cruising spot in the dunes and woods (a French Fire Island if you will). Franck, our protagonist, is drawn to a man whom he later witnesses drowning his lover. Despite all of this he becomes involved with him and the plot takes many twists and turns from there. This film was a big hit at Cannes, winning awards for it's director and it is not hard to see why.",1400889600,3,797,4.32
6234130,5,B00HW4O1VG,"Very honest, very insightful into human nature, and what a surprise ending! This film is not concerned about hiding the facts about sex though. It is graphic, but not gratuitous.",1400803200,,178,4.966666666666667
6234171,2,B00HW4O1VG,"I have so many swirling issues with a film like Stranger by the Lake, so deciding where to start in the context of a review is difficult.  I guess I could map out the films plot first, which will take all of three seconds.  Franck is cruising the gay side of a lake, looking for a hookup when he meets Henri, a fat and lonely man who sits alone awaiting someone to talk to.  They become friends.  Then Franck sees Michel, an attractive and mysterious man and hes hooked.  When Franck literally watches Michel murder someone at the lake, he becomes even more entranced and delves deep into a sexual relationship, despite the police swarming the scene looking for answers to the murder.

The problem with this is that none of this is even remotely interesting.  The sex, violence and suspense are just dull.

There are literally two things that I enjoyed about this film.  Patrick D'Assumao is really, really good as Henri.  His scenes with Pierre Deladonchamps (who plays Franck) are the only glimpses into any sort of backstory or point to this film, but they are sadly too few.  Also, the final frames, that climax (pun intended) is exceptionally directed.

Im done.

The heap of praise that this film has received has baffled me a bit.  Ive debated this with some friends who don't feel as I do, and I still cannot bring myself to get their point, even though I kind of want to (who wants to be the odd man out).  Still, as much as they defend this, I find myself more and more convinced that it doesnt work.  I am one who often praises minimalism, but Stranger by the Lake is so minimalist that it basically goes absolutely nowhere.  The first half just hangs there pointlessly, doing nothing to really propel or even build a real story.  When the murder happens, it all feels so unimportant, and the way that the film just keeps moving forward only cements that.  But then, when the body is found and it feels like maybe something is going to pick up, the film doesnt feel even remotely concerned with making it all work.  I just didn't go anywhere for me.  It just meandered meaninglessly and felt so hollow.

The direction felt so lazy, but maybe that is the wrong word.  Underdeveloped?  Unformulated?

I guess maybe if the suspense that so many have noted were there, I would have reacted better to this film, but I never felt remotely moved (in any way) by any of this (outside of Henri).  Everything just seemed to hang there lifelessly.  So many have noted suspense building in the moment when Franck follows Michel into the lake, but I felt nothing.  Nothing felt delved into, and I don't mean from a ""let's play ominous music and have an intense action scene"" but I never felt like these were even real characters.  I took something away from Henris fate, and at least he made me ponder, but outside of him (and he was not the focal point so there was a lot outside of him) I just couldn't muster a care.

But someone told me that this movie is about HIV, and like, with all the careless, unprotected sex going on, it makes sense in a way, but not in a way that makes me reevaluate the movie itself.",1400716800,12,3112,4.466312056737588

I found the story to be interesting and it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat after a point. There was some humor and sadness in its characters. The murderer ""Michele"" was handsome and easy on the eyes. Esthetically it was a genuinely valid flick. Otherwise, it could have been produced by the gay porn company Falcon. It reminded me of the first gay video porn that came out in the early 80s with a story woven between alot of sex. Folks.....there is ALOT of sex in this and I don't mean soft porn. Its full on slurping, sloppy gay sex, even a scene with analingus. There is nothing left to the imagination including spurting cum shots. This was all fine by me but I felt compelled to at the least make this known to the person who might not really have an idea of just how far this goes.

Beautifully photographed and no holds bar viewing of how life is at a gay nude beach.  Reminded me of one aspect of Crusing in that the sexual turn-on was being with a murderer.

6234178,5,B00HW4O1VG,"What do you do when you witness a murder being committed but become sexually attracted to the killer?  This is the dilemma  that faces Franck when,  in the twilight hours at a gay cruising spot, he watches stunned and fascinated as Michel drowns his lover.  Alain Guiraudie's breakthrough movie is a mini-classic that slowly hooks you in with its gradual build up of suspense until its dramatic, inconclusive but brilliant ending. You could say there is not a lot we learn of the protagonists but that's very much in keeping with the mysterious men who spend their days in the woods and the lake searching for anonymous sexual encounters. This could be the main reason for Franck's desire for the homicidal Michel, the sexual fear of danger and the unknown. Henri, a portly ""straight"" man who sits by himself until befriended by Franck, is the only character who seems to have another life although even that could be misleading.  I think the secret of the film's intrigue is the fact it never leaves the lake.  We watch as the same cars arrive each day, park in the same spots, their inhabitants take up their usual locations, persist in keeping some sort of etiquette whether by the water or cruising in the woods.  People who break the rules are frowned upon. It's a little world inside another little world. Seeing a scattering of mostly naked gay men spending their days  at the lake is not unlike seeing the same men spending an afternoon at the golf course. These are male rituals and it all appears rather innocuous until the expected ""action"" occurs in the woods surrounding the lake, leading to more male rituals.  Be warned there are two or three very explicit sex scenes that could have been lifted from a gay porn flick.

As mentioned before this is one of those films that slowly creeps up on you and the ending is electric.  In many ways it reminded me,  in a strange way, of Antonioni's Blow-Up,  the way it all unravels, perhaps with the added touch of a Fassbinder influence. The acting by Pierre Deladonchamps as Franck,  Christophe Paou as Michel (looking like a cross between Mark Spitz and a Falcon porn star of the 70s) and Patrick d'Assumcao as the lonely Henri is exemplary for this type of film.  Director Guiraudie even appears as one of the lakeside participants. A fine film that deserves more than one viewing to fully appreciate its excellence.",1394150400,33,2375,4.702898550724638

8636811,3,B00HW4O1VG,"Heard about this film and was intrigued by the premise, plus I like Hitchcockian-style thrillers.  While I was indifferent to the explicit sex and nudity, and for all its hype, this is not porn: there is no actual anal penetration shown (though admittedly if the actors were actually engaged in real sex, it's still shot like a simulation), one shot of actual fellatio, and a brief shot (no pun intended) of an ejaculation.  Being a French (European) film, there is copious amounts of full-frontal male nudity, but it's handled within the context of the story: young gay man hangs out at a beach on a mountain lake - a well-known (in the stort) hangout and cruising spot for gay men -- I'm assuming it's also  a public park -- where he meets a handsome stranger who may or may not be a murderer.  While hanging out, he and his various friends and acquaintances sunbathe and swim in the nude, though one character admits it's technically illegal, and there is apparently a more ""family-friendly"" beach on the other side of the lake where one man says you can meet women.  Though of course, our protagonist here, named Franck,  is definitely not interested in them.  One thing I found did find interesting is the casual approach to the nudity - only the mysterious stranger, named Michel, is of the muscular, gym-rat type - the other men have normal, everyday flabby or scrawny bodies, which gives a realistic feel to the place.  Had this been an American movie, all of the men would have been drop-dead handsome with washboard abs and bubble butts and ""manscaped"" body hair (if any), and porn-star sized penises.  Even a gay indie movie would have casted them all as Adonises.

As always with a foreign-language film, the subtitles can be intrusive, and in English translation, the dialogue seems stilted and dry.  Perhaps the director (who also wrote it) wanted it to sound like real conversation, but you don't really find too much out other than Franck is trying to be nice to a chubby divorcee, but always turns him down when asked out of a date.  The object of his obsession, Michel, has no problem having sexual trysts with Franck in the woods (where a lot of anonymous gay sex is occurring), but turns down Franck's offers of a date or going back to his place.  The impression I got was the stranger's character was closeted (perhaps even in a hetero relationship) and didn't want to expose his secrets.  Over the course of the movie, one of Michel's ofrmer sex partners - who has a negative run-in with Franck early in the movie winds up dead - drowned in the lake.  A police investigation ensues, and the detective questions the two but they lie and say they didn't really know the deceased.  At this point, paranoia sets in for Franck who seems to question Michel's motives,  But at the end, after a larger tragedy occurs, it is not clear who may have been the killer after all.  Maybe I need  to re-watch it again.  It does look like one of those movies that you may learn more upon multiple viewings.

So, to summarize: a beautifully shot erotic thriller, but one that falls short from it's inherent plotline.  Interestingly, the director/write never leaves the lake to show the characters at ""home.""  Each new day at the beach on the lake opens with a shot of Franck driving his car into the parking area and walking to the lake.  The only thing that changes are clothing and the dwindling number of guys going to the lake (not being killed off, but probably scared off/turned off by the idea that someone died).  Take away the gay sex and nudity, it's essentially a short narrative film about the dangers of cruising for sex and meeting strangers for one-night (or one-day) stands.  At least the plot is linear, unlike say the recent ""Ghost Story"" film or the classic ""Rashomon.""",1518912000,,3792,4.656156156156156

8636813,4,B00HW4O1VG,"There are few movies that come out today that truly disturbs me. And Stranger By The Lake is one of those movies. Huge fan of Pacino's Cruising, and though I love that movie, ' Stranger' is still sending cold chills through me, even after seeing it almost a year ago. The moment that truly affected me was, when two men take a dip into the lake and from afar, we watch, in one constant shot, only one come back to shore, calm, cool and naked. At first, I couldn't believe what had just happened, so, I kept taking it back to the shot watching down at the lake. And yep, each time I watched and listened very closely, the horrifying incident truly came to life, with lots of my imagination filling in. If you have a beautiful for film, forget about the raw sex that flows within, but watch the sneaky shots closely, and then feel the paranoia rush over you. There's another disturbing moment towards the end, with two men getting it on in the bushes during the day. Well, at first, it looks like they are getting it on, but once again, we are the voyeur from afar, trying to see what is really happening, and when we finally see the violence, your mind will fill on the blanks, and imagination is one of the most scariest things a horror movie can deliver, like Carpenter's Halloween, for example. The only thing almost more frightening, is the last few seconds that leaves you hanging, suggesting that the killer has either left, or is still lurking in the dark brush right in front of you. I went back five times and slowed the ending down, and once again, my imagination created something more scary than what was right in front of me. I'm down rambling. Maybe the film got to me hard because I have cruised in parks before, but after this film, I won't be doing it no more. Especially during daytime. 'Stranger' is scary!",1511395200,,1824,4.431547619047619
