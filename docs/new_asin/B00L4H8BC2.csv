8663758,2,B00L4H8BC2,Love Yngwie. Picture quality & sound are good. the camera work is AWFUL! Looks like a bootleg. Poor angle. Focused almost exclusively on Yngwie but in a bad way.,1478390400,,161,4.586206896551724
8663759,4,B00L4H8BC2,This dvd is alright but could be a lot better.,1431216000,,46,3.7
8663760,2,B00L4H8BC2,Horrible editing. Multiple performances cut back and forth. Shots inserted in each song that do not match sound. Live in Orlando must refer to soundtrack not video. 95% Yngwie and 5% band.,1417392000,8,188,4.90625
