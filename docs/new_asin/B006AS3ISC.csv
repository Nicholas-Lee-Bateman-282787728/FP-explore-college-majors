8495830,5,B006AS3ISC,"So often these old series just don't hold up when viewed many years later, but happily this is one of the exceptions.  This light-hearted comedy series doesn't seem dated at all.  ""Brush Strokes"" was written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey of ""The Good Life"" aka ""Good Neighbors"" fame and starred Karl Howman of ""Mulberry"" fame. Howman plays Jacko, a painter who can't help being a lady's man.  Jacko doesn't set out to be a lady's man, he just keeps falling in love.  Charming and witty, he attracts a lot of attention, not all of which is good for him.  Gary Waldhorn from ""The Vicar of Dibley"" is Jacko's cantankerous boss and father of one of Jacko's love interests.  He and the rest of the supporting cast are excellent.  With a great cast and even better writers, ""Brush Strokes"" remains very entertaining in that ""Britcom"" way.
