8730357,5,B014DEGV7E,"Well, I don't know exactly where to start. It's an amazing movie  technically speaking , especially for the time that it was made.  The special effects are really good considering it was the early 1900s.  Big surprise ending. I didn't see that coming.  Buy it. Watch it. Be amazed",1485561600,3,280,4.653061224489796

8730360,5,B014DEGV7E,"If you have any doubts about how true this movie is, please read ""Hampton and his Red Shirts,"" written by Alfred B. Williams. Mr Williams was a reporter during reconstruction in South Carolina. His book was written in 1935 before Political Correctness,Deconstructionism,Poststructuralism,Moderism,Minimalism and Academic Collectivism, the reason I read  books wrote during the time the story was taking place.",1470009600,11,409,5.932203389830509
8730361,3,B014DEGV7E,"A technical evaluation here - I'm a bid disappointed in that this remaster isn't as good as could have been. When a title comes up on the screen, it shakes and there's dust marks in the picture. A good restoration would have used a cleaned up title still, and cut or dissolved to it. There are also deshaker programs out there that make a shaking video solid with no movement. This was not done.",1467504000,8,395,4.351351351351352
