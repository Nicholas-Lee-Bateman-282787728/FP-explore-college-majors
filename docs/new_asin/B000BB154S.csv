8084405,4,B000BB154S,"The documentary was, largely, a comprehensive and concise account of the trials faced by Japanese Americans during their internment during the second World War. Although slow at times, the issues raised by the usage of these concentration camps remains important throughout the film, particularly in how the film explores the extent to which Japanese Americans have had to go in order to attain recompense for their times in the camps. Although rather dry in execution, with a perhaps overly legalistic tone, the film brings to light important and divisive issues that faced the American people in the face of the fears of World War II, despite the general lack of convicting evidence against the Japanese people. Overall, the film executes a smart, academic portrayal of the plight of the Japanese, and raises a number of important, ethical questions regarding their imprisonment.",1486339200,,881,5.25531914893617

8084408,4,B000BB154S,"This video was in the traditional style of a documentary, and I have shown it in my classes on law. However, the video put too great an emphasis on the emotional aspects of the unwarranted Internment of Japanese Americans. The greater issue lies in the blatant disregard for the U.S. Constitution raised by these actions. In this respect, it was history that taught us the lesson of what had taken place rather than the Media of the time. Remember, the Mainstream U.S. Media of the era was not even willing to let the public know that their ""President"" was a weakened degenerate confined to a wheelchair. The real issue, of this video and this incident is that A U.S. PRESIDENT SUSPENDED HABEAS CORPUS, IN WHAT WAS CLEARLY AN ACT OF STATE SANCTIONED RACISM! The issue is even more ironic when one considers that the Nazis were doing the same thing at the time, the primary difference being that they gassed their inmates. U.S. citizens were imprisoned without Due Process. U.S. citizens were imprisoned for years without being charged with any crime, other than being born of Japanese descent. This outrage took place under a Democrat President, who never justified his actions. The Attorney General of California at that time later went on to beoome the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Earl Warren, who would later become a Liberal responsible for supporting all forms of Civil Rights, possibly out of guilt for what he did to the Japanese Americans. It should also be noted that Italian Americans were also subjected to these internments in much smaller numbers. And one final point to consider is that we may now be facing a similar circumstance in the current situation with a Media that protects the President in a manner not seen since FDR. It appears that we have failed to learn the lessons of these horrid acts by our government.",1357862400,5,1834,4.806962025316456
8084409,5,B000BB154S,"I show this documentary to my 8th grade class as part of studying Washington State history its history of internment camps and the Japanese-Americans from our state who were imprisoned during WWI.  This documentary opens up great possibilites for disucssing the treatment of Muslim Americans and Hispanic Americans in present times and how entire groups are intimidated and harrased simply for how they look and who they are, out of some sort of misplaced fear. (At least this is what my very compassionate and savvy young people tell me!)  Talk about learning ( or not) from history...",1274659200,10,586,5.030927835051546
8084410,4,B000BB154S,"This movie was extremely interesting and made a ""hidden"" part of our country's history quite understandable to middle school students. All of my students kept asking ""But what about the first amendment?"" ""What about the 5th or 6th amendment?"" Is this legal to do to American citizens? I was so pleased that the students were able to make the connection between what we have learned in class and real life situations.",1273622400,3,416,4.873239436619718
8084411,3,B000BB154S,"Don't expect too much...but no doubt about it, the topic is very interesting...
it's just that the tempo and rhythm of the doc is not that catching. Wish it were really. But don't regret buying it. Simply learning about American concentration camps is something that definitely needs the same attention than all those Nazi story's that directors keep reminding us about...
How can we be so fanatic and paranoid as human beings?",1260835200,,427,4.944444444444445
8084412,4,B000BB154S,"Shortly after America entered WWII, FDR signed Executive Order 9066 giving the government the ability to declare areas of the country military zones and arresting any persons in those areas who were deemed a ""threat.""  Although it did not specify any certain people, the Order was used primarily to round up and incarcerate persons of Japanese descent living in the western U.S.  The detainees found themselves living in what amounted to concentration camps, often in isolated desert areas.  During the war, three Japanese-American men (Gordon Hirabayashi, Monoru Yasui, & Fred Korematsu) filed lawsuits challenging the legality of Executive Order 9066; none were successful.  However, after the war, public opinion began to shift and in the 1980s the three men re-opened their earlier lawsuits.  ""Unfinished Business"" documents the stories of these three men and how their lawsuits affected the Japanese-American community.

""Unfinished Business"" (1985) is a worthwhile documentary on an important topic - one of the low points in American history.  The documentary is definitely a no-frills affair, with minimal narration, text, and recreations, which might bore audiences today used to flashier documentaries.  At times, the documentary doesn't include enough detail and is poorly paced.  For example, the narrator mentions that many of the men in the camps were later allowed to join the U.S. military, but they provide no details about how this change occurred.  Instead, it focuses on brief interviews with some of the Japanese-Americans who were forced into the camps.  Their stories are affecting and in no need of adornment.  However, the finale concerning the lawsuits is told in an incredibly flat and technical manner with no suspense or elaboration; it almost seems like an afterthought.  Despite these weaknesses, ""Unfinished Business"" is still informative.  The film was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards, losing to ""Broken Rainbow"" (another film documenting the ""relocation"" of an American minority group).",1247270400,11,2049,5.5256410256410255
8084413,5,B000BB154S,"One of the very few documentaries on this subject of the condition of Japanese-Americans who had been living in America for generations furing WW2. Before I saw this, I was totally unaware of the existence of concentration camps (which were called ""relocation camps"") with poor living conditions, into which thousands of Japanese Americans were herded. The trauma of war on a country's psyche is quite well documented here and is no different from similar emotions faced by other countries during times of conflict.

Also interesting was the hope and faith of some Japanese Americans in the American justice system to seek redressal of their humiliation - and also, how the justice system, though slow, didn't fail them.",1179964800,32,720,5.153846153846154
