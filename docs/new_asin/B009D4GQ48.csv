5317369,5,B009D4GQ48,"All the stories in this Rabbit Ear collection are narrated by well known celebrities.  Denzel Washington tells the story of Anansi, a South African god that is full of tricks. Taking the form of a spider, he artfully weaves his web of tales. The art and music only add to this fun rendition of 'favorite and unusual tales.' Happy viewing!",1376352000,,338,4.633333333333334
5317370,5,B009D4GQ48,"I'd recommend this movie to anyone who believes in spider myths. I do!
I have seen and killed over a dozen spiders in the last two weeks. Most of them were on the outside of my home, and they were sized from small to medium to large to xl. What the!!
This movie about the mythical Anansi gave me some cheerful analagies and a little laughter.
Believe what you may about spiders, I know there is definitely a stranger in the future for this family.
Peace and Blessings!!

8540001,5,B009D4GQ48,"This is an amazing story about how Anansi the Spider became The Best Storyteller. It is an animated film that is narrated by Denzel Washington. Denzel does an amazing job with his accent, inflection, and emotion during this voiceover performance. Yes, it is one voice because it is someone telling a story. It is not meant to be an animated cartoon, but an animated story. Since I teach African arts, I use the video as an introduction to storytelling and how stories are passed down from one generation to another. It is a great introduction to projects around story quilts, folktales, and the creation of art books. I highly recommend this video for children and adults alike.",1440115200,2,678,4.803418803418803
