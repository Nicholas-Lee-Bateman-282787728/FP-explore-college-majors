546107,3,6303072194,"I guess this is supposed to be a remake of the 1930 70mm widescren King Vidor film of the same name; for many reasons those early widescreen processes disappeared as quickly as they appeared and so the only thing they could do to at all recapture the novelty and make something special a decade later was to film the thing in Technicolor, largely on location in Monument Valley - I think this was the first color film shot there. And it looks mighty fine - Gordon Avil's lighting is excellent, and his use of colors good-to-great; the early scenes with Billy (Robert Taylor) in black riding through the (unnamed) town on his shiny black horse look really swell.

Alas that's about all that's mighty fine about this generally plodding and predictable myth-making bad-guy-goes-good-then-bad-again tale. Forget historical accuracy of course - we don't even have a Pat Garrett here, but a stand-in called Jim Sherwood (Brian Donlevy, giving the best performance in the film). Billy falls in with bad businessman Dan Hickey (Gene Lockhart) in the beginning, but soon finds that sophisticated, pacifistic Englishman Eric Keating (Ian Hunter) is the guy who will help lead him away from crime; but of course things turn sour and eventually Hunter's right-hand man Sherwood has to bring his childhood friend to justice. None of it is particularly well developed or rationalized; things just happen to serve the inevitability of the bad guy having to come to justice.

I don't know what role uncredited co-director Frank Borzage played here; perhaps some of the more sentimental moments are his, such as those involving Billy's friend Pedro or the sort-of love interest.  Borzage was one of the great directors of the 20s and 30s, and I'd like to believe that his talents weren't diminished in the war-and-later years, just that he fell out of fashion.  Maybe I'm being too kind?  I did like how the town seems to be on the edge of Monument Valley, and every other location must be on another side of it, so that the characters have to always ride through it to maximize the use of the location. And of course there are no Navajo or Hopi Indians anywhere to be seen...

In short, worth seeing for the early Technicolor; I suppose hard-core Taylor fans might go for it as well, but if you want to see how he does in a western please please check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-s-Doorway/dp/B003XTL54K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil's Doorway</a>&nbsp;before bothering with this mediocrity.",1381795200,,2535,5.12590799031477

546110,3,6303072194,"Entertaining though fictionalised account of events in the life of ""Billy The Kid"" William Bonney, played here by Robert Taylor. Taylor joins Gene Lockhart's cattle rustling gang but when the gang murders landowner Ian Hunter, who is also the father of potential love interest Mary Howard, Taylor takes revenge and kills those responsible. Throughout the movie Taylor does not appear entirely at ease in the role and plays a rather stern and taciturn Billy. Marshal Brian Donlevy is excellent as Taylor's long time friend. The tragic loss of that friendship at the end of the film is very well effected. The Monument Valley scenery provides a stunning visual backdrop to the story, in brilliant Technicolor hues.

Warner Archive's DVD-R presentation of Billy The Kid is not without its problems. Color is vivid but the picture is frequently marred by persistent shimmer and film damage. This is one film deserving of some restoration work. Sound is clear but very low, requiring the raising of the TV volume control to almost its full level. There is a theatrical trailer for the movie but no subtitles, alternative languages or scene selections are provided.

546112,5,6303072194,"Admittedly, this beautifully shot film has little to do with the historical character of Billy the Kid, and I recall when I first viewed it, it came as a shock to me that except for the title, well, it could have been most any other competent Western produced by Hollywood. However, like most films---and certainly most Westerns---you just must remove yourself from strict historical considerations. This has been particularly true of such historical events as the famous ""gunfight at the OK Corral"" or portrayals of the James brothers, the Youngers, Kit Carson, Davy Crockett, the Alamo, and so much else. How many of the entertaining films made based supposedly on these subjects purport to be ""true to history""? Some, it is true, make the claim; but haven't most of us learned years ago not to take such claims as gospel?

Indeed, that's not really the point when considering such modes of entertainment, and it certainly should not affect our enjoyment of this fine and very colorful film, starring Robert Taylor. When it was produced, Technicolor was still a rare application; black and white was still the norm. Yet this film gets its right---glorious color, great scenic vistas that would have enchanted our fathers and grandfathers on the big screen. And the acting? Well, Taylor was a versatile actor who did extremely well on a horse. Some of his later films, especially AMBUSH and DEVIL'S DOORWAY are classics in the Western genre, and SADDLE THE WIND and THE LAW AND JAKE WADE are near (and very entertaining) misses. He was good at what he did, and the star of KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE and other swashbucklers was a convincing, if mature, Westerner.

The other major character, Brian Donlevy, has always been a bit underrated as an actor. And, again, he makes a fine Westerner.

So, I am delighted that Warner has seen fit to issue this classic. It's fun and full of great action, beautiful photography, and pretty good acting. It may lack some of the historicity of the earlier Johnny Mack Brown vehicle or some of the later attempts to get at the Billy the Kind persona. But that's okay; I take it as it is, and as it is, it's great entertainment.",1339027200,4,2164,4.780748663101604
546113,1,6303072194,"Look as much as you like, you'll not find anything even vaguely resembling Billy the Kid in this 1941 remake of the Johnny Mack Brown (Billy) and Wallace Beery (Garrett) 1930 film directed by King Vidor. Erstwhile actor Robert Taylor was 30 years old when the film was made, had a heavy beard, and looked older than almost anyone else in the movie. Taylor was a good actor (e.g., ""Quo Vadis"", ""Ivanhoe"", ""Camille"") and he does a reasonable job in this film too - but not as Billy the Kid. Indeed, even the plot has nothing to do with Billy's life, and the shootout between Taylor and Brian Donlevy (playing Jim Sherwood - whoever he was) is just plain silly.

Lon Chaney Jr is completely wasted in the film, as is Donlevy. Gene Lockhart manages to put in some good on screen time as the villain, and Grant Withers plays his usual dependable heavy.

The scenery in this film is beautifully photographed and the use of technicolor was unusually good for 1941. Right-handed Robert Taylor does a formidible job drawing a gun with his left hand.

If you're looking for good films about Billy the Kid, look at ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"", the great 1973 film by Sam Peckinpah starring James Coburn and Kris Kristopherson. From a totally different perspective, but perhaps closer to the truth, you might look at ""Dirty Little Billy"", a 1972 film starring Michael J. Pollard. Personally I enjoyed the Clu Gulager (Billy) and Barry Sullivan (Garrett) performances in the TV Series ""The Tall Men"" (1960 to 1982)",1263772800,5,1505,4.693181818181818
546114,3,6303072194,"Robert Taylor was only 30 years old when he played the title role in the 1941 film ""Billy the Kid,"" but he still seems too old for the role.  However, this actually works in favor of the story being told in this film, not that it has much to do with the historical facts regarding Billy the Kid, even though the script is based on Walter Noble Burns's book ""The Saga of Billy the Kid"" (although Taylor gets props for learning how to shoot with his left hand for the film).
The story is set in 1880 when the Kid breaks his friend Pedro (Frank Puglia) out of jail and gets involved in some outlaw activity.  But then the embittered outlaw ends up working for a pacifist farmer, Eric Keating (Ian Hunter), who tries to reform Jesse and insists that if you do not wear a gun the code of the West will stop anyone from shooting an unarmed man and keeps proclaiming that law and order is coming to the wild West.  Billy also takes a shine to Keating's sister Edith (Mary Howard), who presents another reason for going straight.  Meanwhile it turns out that Billy's old friend Jim ""Holy"" Sherwood (Brian Donlevy in the Pat Garrett role), is now the foreman for Keating's ranch.  When Keating becomes a marshal he makes Jim a deputy and give Billy his parole, Billy gives Edith a colt, and it looks like Billy might be able to live happily ever after.  But then Keating gets shot in the back and all bets are off.
At that point this 1941 film basically combines your standard western revenge story with the established legend of Billy the Kid's death.  Since the law, represented at this point by Sherwood, is unable to bring Keating's killer to justice, it is left to Billy to go kill the killer before being gunned down himself.  If the question is whether Billy is still trying to do good or has gone back to his bad ways, then the answer would come when Billy guns down Dan Hickey (Gene Lockhart) by shooting him in the back.
Ironically, the biggest problem with this tale of ""Billy the Kid"" is that it told about Billy the Kid.  If you changed the name and made Robert Taylor's character anybody else then the film works a lot better.  Taylor just has too much gravity to be anybody ""the Kid"" let alone the most famous one of them all.  Besides, all they are really using from the life of William H. Bonney is the idea that he was an outlaw.  This is especially true because at the end of the film you get the sense that he is relieved to be able to go back to what he does best.",1082937600,,2476,4.3125

It is perhaps slightly better than most westerns of the 1940s, but it is not very exciting and certainly not suspenseful. Billy is shown as a hot-head, but well-meaning young man. Robert Taylor acts well and wears black whenever he puts on his guns. Some of the scenes showing men riding were clearly filmed against a backdrop. These items take away something from the film, but, as I wrote, it was still fun.",1435104000,,563,4.475728155339806

7836119,4,6303072194,"Billy the Kid (1941) is an early example of the use of Technicolor.  The film is visually outstanding.  Cinematographers William V. Skall and Leonard Smith received an Oscar nomination for their work on the film and should have won.  From close-ups to panoramic views of Monument Valley, Kanab, Utah and other locations they used color, composition and especially light masterfully.  Some scenes evoke the stillness of a Vermeer and others the chiaroscuro of Rembrandt.  Near the end of the movie Billy is standing near the window of a tumbledown shack.  The viewer is outside and can see his body fading into the shadows except for the upper part of his face, especially the intense blue eyes.  There is a Caravaggio-like spotlight on the hand and gun the outlaw is pointing out the window.

Historically, there is little resemblance between the film and the actual life of Billy the Kid.  The general details of his background is correct but the names have all been changed, perhaps to head off the complaints of purists.  There is no Pat Garrett, but rather a Jim Sherman (Brian Donlevy), no William Tunstall but an Eric Keating (Ian Hunter).  The filmmakers obviously wanted to tell a good story without regard to historical accuracy.

Robert Taylor was 30 when Billy the Kid was filmed. He's too old for the part but not by as much as some have made out.  To seem younger, Taylor plays Billy as uncouth, uneducated and probably illiterate.  The outlaw is incapable of understanding the consequences of his actions.  He's always being bombarded by new ideas and new customs. There is a lighthearted scene where Billy is handed a teacup and saucer, objects obviously new to him.  He picks the cup up as though it were a glass until he sees what Keating is doing.  Billy holds the cup awkwardly by the handle until Keating turns away then he gulps the tea with his original hold.

This was Robert Taylor in his element.  He was a superb rider and did all of his own riding in this film, even in the long shots.  Taylor also had the western swagger down pat and seems very comfortable in his cowboy costumes. In private life, he often wore jeans, boots and a Stetson.  In the first and last parts of the film, Billy dresses all in black. In the middle he wears a blue shirt to indicate his changed lifestyle. Robert Taylor practiced left-handed drawing and shooting for weeks before the film and used the skill again in the film Ride Vaquero in 1953.

Taylor and Donlevy are comfortable with one another, having worked together before in This Is My Affair in 1937.  The easiness of their relationship makes Billy's (temporary) transformation into an honest cowboy believable.  Mary Howard has a small role as Eric Keating's sister and makes the most of it. Ian Hunter is believable as rancher Keating. The villains, especially Hickey (Gene Lockhart) are suitably nasty.  Henry O'Neill, a leading character actor, throws himself with gusto into the role of a newspaper publisher whose press is constantly being sabotaged.

So whether you like a good story, a series of beautiful visuals or just like to look at Robert Taylor, this film is for you.",1390003200,2,3147,4.77079482439926
