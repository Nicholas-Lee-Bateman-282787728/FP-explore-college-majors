5571545,3,B00BBUNUOG,"I decided to watch the series because my big brother and sis-in-law said it was good. Fast-forward weeks later I just finished the series on Netflix, and I'm truly disappointed with the series finale. Now I'm not going to give the series a 1 or 2 because there were plenty of moments I did enjoy, and many characters I loved. However, the writers decided to kill off the majority of the characters I liked. I was shocked and pleased that Agron and Nasir (the gay couple) actually survived. Anyways, how do you let the two villains that should've been killed survive but you let Spartacus die from his wounds? It would've been a better ending had Spartacus and Marcus Licinius Crassus the dreadful leader of the Romans both stabbed each other with the swords at the same time and taking each other's lives. But no Marcus gets rescued by his soldiers! I could go on for hours and I'll end my review with this will I watch this again? No, I'm over it. Would I recommend people to buy this series? Not really I'd rather they watch it on Netflix and don't get too attached to the characters.",1515110400,,1086,4.48989898989899

Needing to feed my obsession I went searching for a good hard copy of the series, and was so happy to see this set was still available, and at such a great price. The figure is very well detailed, and I really love how it is able to hold the Blu-Ray discs.

5571566,5,B00BBUNUOG,"I love this show!  Highly Addictive and a great show to binge watch!  You will instantly love all of the characters and this show has some of the best writing that I have seen in a long time.  Great acting and some well known faces!  Granted, its VERY Graphic and every episode has tons of sex ( soft porn basically) and violence but I guess that's what makes the show so true to life, despite the blood special effects which was created to be stylized but effective.
As far as the box set goes, it's sturdy and easy to use. It's impossible for the disks to get loose and get scratched. Well made!  However, I did have a couple of episodes that were unwatchable due to skipping and problems with playback.  I was way past the point to return it but I wasn't discouraged.

5571570,1,B00BBUNUOG,"It was a good series and too graphic although that is the appeal for many. I enjoyed watching for a bit but had to stop.  The younger slave relationship with one of the fighters really, really disturbed me because having a teen son, it struck me as a child-adult relationship YUCK.  I could not watch the series any longer.  If the characters looked older and as adults that would be different.  It simply crossed a line for me.",1495843200,,428,4.448717948717949

Everything is well done, The fight choreography is top notch, the visuals of the locations perfect, and the ""talent"" of both sexes, impeccable. There's no deep meaning of life stuff here, yawn, just fantastic, action oriented entertainment that does not get you bogged down in another lame PC storyline.

Amazon customer service was very helpful with resolving the issues I had with the two sets that would not play properly. As for the series itself, what can I say, Spartacus is totally awesome.

The acting was well done by all.  A word of caution to anyone who has not seen this.  There are a couple of violent scenes.  ""lol""  Which brings me to my only complaint,.  After the 60th or 70th fight,  they all kind of seemed the same.  But other than that,  it was excellent.",1483056000,2,436,4.234567901234568

the extreme violence than simmers in the minds of the insane who thrive
on this gore. Don't think this was ever a part of the first amendment.
Of no redeeming value. Should be banned. The over two hundred
producers, directors and actors of this series should really re-
examine their money making motives. A waste of time. A waste of
creative energy. One of the sickest series/movies every made... Bravo!",1481414400,,473,4.851851851851852

5571615,4,B00BBUNUOG,"This is a review of the content, not the set.

Spartacus started out as a very decent series.  As the season progressed, main characters changed.  Not just in the way that one leaves and another enters but one actor replaces another in the same role.  This isn't so great.

The first three seasons are Spartacus as a gladiator.  These are the best written and best acted.  They also contain, mostly, the original actors in roles.  After that, well, things change.  Spartacus is on the outside fighting for the small guy (and himself) and characters change.  The acting isn't so good as the replacement actors must have been B listers waiting for a shot when the A listers left.

Is it worth watching?  Yes.  Is it worth owning if you've already watched it?  Only each individual can answer that.  For me, no.  For others, perhaps.",1479168000,,830,4.659722222222222

Boy Howdy, this show is over the top disgusting . . . a guilty pleasure you just can't take your eyes off.  Seems now we have a terrible need to find out how this Roman party ends!!  So, naturally we have to buy the set because we don't want to up our monthly cable bill by subscribing to Starz.  There is just no other way to find out what happens to our fave gladiators, lol.

My all time favorite show to watch out of all movies, TV shows, and series ever made.  The series was lost with the loss of it's star, Andy Whitfield, who died from cancer before the sequel could be made.  The sequels are not as good and Andy's replacement even worse.  I yearned for the rest of the history to be told because it was actually just beginning at the end of season 1.  The army of free men grew to hundreds of thousands and fought the Roman army for 3 long years after they broke bondage.  They made it past Rome to the mountains and were free, forever, but became greedy and tried to overthrow Rome, which led to the splitting of their army and eventually, their downfall.  I accept the rest of the story will never be told, at least with the same quality as the first season of Spartacus.",1458345600,2,932,4.377906976744186

5571675,5,B00BBUNUOG,"In short, one of the most glamorous looking shows you could ever see on TV. Blood, profanity, nudity, sex all in Roman times...but don't let that discourage you. This show has its own style. It thrives on how pretty everything looks, in both the special and practical effects area. And the dialogue spoken is its own niche for a show (consider shows like Deadwood for a good example. Sure, there's quite a bit of profanity worked in here and there, but the words spoken feels oddly poetic). The story overall is one that was covered before by a legendary actor 50 years prior in a great film. A Thracian man is enslaved and manages to lead a slave uprising across Roman lands, encouraging one of the greatest threats to Roman living to ever exist. Yet the movie only has time to focus on major elements of the story. The show gets more breathing room.

Across four seasons, we are immersed in a particular world. Blood and Sand introduces us to Spartacus and the slaves he acquaints himself with and befriends until the eventual uprising. The actor in this season, Andy Whitfield, made his mark as Spartacus, a character that we sympathize with from the first moments in to the end where he becomes the leader against slavery. Real life tragedy afflicts Andy Whitfield with lymphona, delaying the production of the show for a second season. Instead, Gods of the Arena (set as a six episode prequel to Blood and Sand) is made and not only gives us cause and reasoning behind the motivations of many characters chronicled in Blood and Sand, but also introduces us to a character who manages to make their mark enough they return later. Spartacus's actor died during the same year of Gods of the Arena, leading to finding a worthy successor in Liam McIntyre to take up the mantle of the lead. Vengeance released, leading to War of the Damned as the show's final season. By this time, four seasons of the show had formed an entertainment niche that had become exciting to watch and saddening to see end.

The packaging is a hard outer casing that folds open, showing a little book inside that has cardboard pages for individual discs. You also get the UV voucher for this as well.

Overall, this show is a niche one. If you're a fan of Stephen S DeKnight's work on Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse, and Smallville (and lately, Daredevil's first season as showrunner), and you want an excuse to watch high definition special effects of blood, sex, nudity, violence, and the like, look no further than this gem.",1452211200,12,2496,4.668181818181818

5571687,4,B00BBUNUOG,"Overall this is a fantastic show. I think they did as good a job as possible with the historical relevance of what was know of the time and the battles between Rome and Spartacus. But don't get me wrong there was also a lot of Hollywood in the show to attempt to fill in those unknown areas with drama and sex. Very little was even know of Spartacus so for anyone to truly say that they blew the historical value of the show really doesn't know much about history. NOW, even with that said I am not going to say that they hit every aspect of what was actually known. For example: The true Batiatus was not name Quintus but rather Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus and the over use of the F-word which wasn't officially documented until the year 1564. I also can't say for certain that Caesar was apart of the war, but it is highly possible as the war was in 73 BC and this would have made him around 27 years and already had a great documented military background as well is that it was well known he was affiliated for years with Crassus and Pompey.

I also keep seeing the comparison to the show Rome, don't get me wrong I thought that was a fantastic show and I think it was more accurately portrayed of the Roman streets, but keep in mind Rome was based on the time frame well after Spartucus around 20 years later when the Gallic were about over.

ANYWAYS, I thought Andy Whitfield was a good fit for that roll, it was a tragedy for the show that he got ill and passed away after season 1. But I think all of the actors in the show did a fantastic job and not any one particular actor was carrying the show, I didn't care for the new Spartacus Liam Mclntyre for season 2 since he was drastically different from Andy, but after about 6 episode he started to kinda grow on ya. There was also a less noticeable swap in Naevia, I thought Cynthia came in a did a great job, not sure why they swapped this role, but it worked. Overall if you like history, action, blood/gore, sexy people doing sexy things then this is a show you need to watch. If you want a 100% documentary without all the cinematography then watch the History channel. The only reason I do not give this 5 stars is because I think they did miss some documented and easy to apply facts, Otherwise its a 5 star show for sure.",1446508800,3,2284,4.236238532110092

5571702,5,B00BBUNUOG,"Spartacus is definitely one of the greatest television experiences I have ever had the pleasure in partaking.  Not only is the storyline free from filler episodes and convoluted storylines, it is enamored in great characterizations. It dispenses with the cheesy, generic villain and gives each character, hero and villain a wealth of emotion and backstory. We all know how the story of Spartacus ends and I have to say that the directors gave it an amazing ending--I was initially worried that it would be a let down but the ending was as strong, if not stronger than the beginning.  There is lots of drama, sex, nudity and violence but none of it seems gratuitous.  Spartacus is one of those great production values that never lets you down.",1439942400,2,742,4.826771653543307

5571734,5,B00BBUNUOG,"I love this boxset! Nothing is left out, this is the complete series in glorious Blu-Ray. All the discs are in sleeves that are in a bound book. If you are a fan of this show this is a great buy. Most episodes are the 'extended versions', which offers a better viewing experience from the original. However, if you are happy with watching Spartacus on Netflix you should know that Netflix is showing the extended versions as well (as far as I can tell). What Netflix does not offer of course is all the special featurettes and the commentary on all the episodes.

Yes, all the violence and sex, all the blood and gore, and frontal nudity is here, but the real power of this show is the characters. The actors are great, the writing is great, the production and direction is excellent. If you've not seen the extended versions you won't be disappointed. Too bad the show ended after 4 seasons. We all know the outcome for Spartacus and crew, but the show could have told many more stories in between. Andy was a great Spartacus, but Liam was every bit as good as Andy.

5571751,2,B00BBUNUOG,"I would call this movie a good thriller based on the war of Rome against the slaves. I agree that film creators have a right to fantasize about
history to some extend, but this is way too much - Julius Cesar is not any less importance for Roman history then Spartacus, and it's well known
that he was not involved at all into crashing of the slaves, not only Cesar was not involved, but if he was, a leader of his size would never be  sent to slaves to risk his life as an agent, so my point is: at least if you create a fantasy, try to make it close to real life. I do agree that fights
are looking impressive due to computer technology, but again not realistic - with short  roman sword is almost impossible to cut a head, like it was done so many times with ease in this movie. Not only actors are bleeding, but history and reality also.",1424044800,3,840,4.115853658536586

It veered away from history at times, but it was still pretty accurate. One got a pretty good sense of the greatness - and depravity - of ancient Rome.
I love Spartacus' honor and strength of character. One could see how he was able to rally thousands of slaves.

And...I could watch Liam McIntyre all day. His Spartacus character didn't have a lot to smile about, but on those rare occasions when he did? Ya' gotta' love those dimples. lol",1423526400,2,528,4.443298969072165

5571762,5,B00BBUNUOG,"If you enjoy historical fiction, Spartacus will be quite the feast. In all honestly, I got started with this series as an avid fan of Xena: Warrior Princess. Many of the people involved in the production Xena lent their talent to Spartacus: Lucy Lawless, Michael Hurst, Rob Tapert et al, Chloe Smith! If you're a Xenite, you'll recognize some very familiar faces among the cast. You'll also recognize some very familiar themes: from ""KILL THEM ALL!!!"" to ""the Greater Good"". The people involved in the making of Spartacus have managed to take a very nasty subject, slavery,  and giving contemporary viewers a reminder that the fundamental rights of human beings can NEVER be left to popular opinion.

As more than one reviewer has said, the first episode is nothing to write home about. The gore was over the top while the character development was somewhat wanting. I would urge everyone to give Spartacus at least a half dozen episodes before judging its merit.

I think the whole of Spartacus can be summed up in the lyrics written by the late Janis Joplin: ""freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."" A surprising number of modern treatises defend Rome's practice of conquest & enslavement.  The premise is that slavery (and training them in a craft) is far more humane than execution. It's important to remember that the Empire could never have existed without forced labor. Any benefit to the slave was probably accidental. Drama like Spartacus serves to remind us that the servitude is NEVER benevolent. It's NEVER for the benefit of the serf. If allowed to, social order will sink to the lowest and most base.",1423267200,2,1629,4.870036101083032
5571763,5,B00BBUNUOG,"This is an increadible series.  As a Roman history buff, the Sparticus series has all the real characters we know about in history.  Spartacus was Thracian, and did train as a gladiator in the house of Batiatus.  His fellow rebels, Gannicus, Crixus and Onemeus were real-life persons (as well as some others you see in the series), and the roles they play roughly correspond to what we know actually happened.  On top of the historical accuracies, the action is increadible.  The producers exercise directoral discretion in such a was as to maintain surprise while altering the true history in such a was at to not offend your senses.  This is a masterful job, and the price of this set is well worth your money.  The very first episode is the worst in the series, but regardless, stands on it's own and draws you into the rest of the series.  The biggest issue was the death of Andy Whitfield from cancer, may he rest in peace.  The producers did a great job of introducing the prequel between seasons one and three, and returned to the timeline in season 3 with Liam McIntyre playing the role of Spartacus.  McIntyre derserves an emmy for his performance, and paid homage to Andy Whitfield by his (McIntyre's) amazing performance.  Buy this, either on DVD, Blu Ray or in Prime/Fire TV because you will love this series.  A cautionary note though, this is purely adult entertainment so please ensure that your children are not around becuase there is gratuitous violence, sex including homosexual/lesbian sex and rape, and orgies.  Like I said, this is an historically accurate series.",1423180800,2,1586,4.808118081180812

Just get the set. Search Spartacus Tribute on youtube when you're finish watching the set and click on the first video that says ""Free Will.""

5571788,5,B00BBUNUOG,"First, for those that may not have ever seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD or Instant Video based on its popularity, Spartacus: War of the Damned is season 3 of the show but technically the fourth season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the title Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.

The prequel was called Gods of the Arena and it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. Then in Vengeance we got Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there was something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; in Vengeance, McIntyre was a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much. But in War of the Damned something changed...dramatically...McIntyre stopped smiling and started kicking and carving you-know-what. And ultimately, War of the Damned rivaled the first season...which is saying a lot!

Indeed...War of the Damned is one of the best series finales that I have ever sat through. McIntyre really captured the essence of what Whitfield started in season one: Spartacus as a down but not beaten man thrown into slavery determined to be free and stop at nothing to do so. The supporting cast deserves high honors as well; returning characters put their hearts' and souls' into every episode--especially Manu Bennett as Crixus. And new cast members had some tough shoes to fill after some amazing performances by the likes of John Hannah, Lucy Lawless and several others in seasons past. But the new characters filled their parts with passion and believability...especially those in the parts of Crassus, his son Tiberius, and Julius Gaius Caesar.

As for the show itself, similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus War of the Damned leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory. The events of Spartacus War of the Damned take place after Spartacus' gang of gladiators escape slavery and form a large rebellion to strike down Roman slavery, and if you know the true story of Spartacus then you know that this series finally will leave fans as disappointed in Spartacus' end as they are satisfied with the absolute best series to have ever aired on the Starz network.

Keep the credits rolling after the final episode of War of the Damned to see the tribute with Andy Whitfield in the Arena shouting: ""I am SPARTACUS!""

Blood and Sand: 5 stars
Gods of the Arena: 4 stars
Vengeance: 3 stars
War of the Damned: 5 stars",1419897600,33,3380,4.975221238938053

3. <censored> advertising,
4. <censored> advertising that you cannot get past,
5. kinda cheap holders, and
6. I did have to fast forward past all the gay scenes of man-on-man action.  That was disgusting.  Yes, I know it was prevalent in that time BUT I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT.",1416960000,,454,4.445783132530121

5571821,5,B00BBUNUOG,"We don't have Starz on our cable, so I didn't know of this series until SyFy started running them....wow. This is a great series, definitely for adults and non-squemish adults at that.  That action, great acting, great characters.. Due to the time they show these, I have missed several episodes so I decided since Prime didn't have them as free streaming like they do the HBO series ROME (another great period piece) , I'd have to buy the series. Luckily I found this collection at a really good price. I haven't switched to Blu-Ray yet as I can get the video on Prime, hook my Kindle to the TV and lay back.
If you like gladiator movies (no, not the way they meant in ""Airplane""), this is the series for you. Done in a style like ""300"", with lots of still image 3-D effects...really great. And seeing Lucy Lawless running around in skin did not hurt my feelings a bit ;)",1416009600,2,872,4.416149068322981

I really enjoyed the first two(2)  of the series but, for some reason I just couldn't get into the new Spartacus in Vengeance and War of the Damned. Get rid of the figurine, include Seasons 1-3 of Spartacus and Spartacus Gods of the Arena in the Blu-ray format with all the extras and you might have a package worth $79.95.",1414713600,2,371,4.621212121212121
5571826,5,B00BBUNUOG,"After seeing Gladiator, many of us were hankering for more action from the Roman arenas! We found it in the four year series Spartacus which might just be my favorite series of all time. Great acting, great plot, thrilling action, and vivid presentation like you have never seen.

I remember watching several episodes of Spartacus and being amazed how drawn in I was to the plot line.

Don't believe me? Watch the first year series, Blood and Sand, and see if you can resist the following shows!

And RIP Andy Whitfield for being an incredible actor!",1414108800,4,550,4.708333333333333

5571831,4,B00BBUNUOG,"This will be a spoiler free review of the series, so I will refrain from writing about characters unless absolutely necessary. I will also describe the box set. The review stars will encompass the series as well as the box set and special features.

  I stumbled upon spartacus when the first season was beginning, and from then on, the series held my attention as one of the greatest television series I have ever seen.
 I will get one thing out of the way first. The first episode is pretty mediocre in my opinion. It tries too hard to be like the movie ""300"" and because of the budget, it's not up to the level of Hollywood films. So as a precaution, please do not expect te first episode to be like the rest of the series.
Season 1, called ""Blood and Sand"", tells the story of spartacus, played by the late Andy Whitfield, from his journey of Thracian soldier to legend of the arena. After the dismal first episode, the rest of the season is an awesome ride to vengeance filled with tons of violence and sex. Besides that, the acting is top notch and all the characters are awesome and you will more than likely develop and attachment to them.
Following ""Blood and Sand,"" the prequel season, ""Gods of the Arena,"" begins. Tragedy befell the spartacus series with the sudden illness of Andy Whitfield being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Because of this, the series decided to give backstory by way of prequel telling the story of Spartacus' Roman owner, Batiatus and his wife Lucretia.
The prequel deals with Batiatus' rise from lowly owner of gladiators to the man we see in ""Blood and Sand."" There are only 6 episodes for this season but every single one is awesome and moves the story at a great pace. Besides Batiatus, we also see the introduction of a new character, the Celtic gladiator, Gannicus.

Andy Whitfield was no longer able to play the character because of his illness and sadly, Andy passed away from the cancer.

Following ""Gods,"" we go back to the current time with season 3, called ""Vengeance."" We once again follow the titular character, now played by Liam McIntyre. Andy was a great spartacus and fortunately, Liam makes the role his own and the season does not falter. We follow the ex gladiator and his band of rebels as they free more slaves and face the Roman Praetor called Glaber. The season is awesome as the previous seasons have been and sets up the last season for an amazing end.

The last and final season is ""War of the Damned,"" and for me this is probably the best season of the entire series. Spartacus' group of rebels has grown to an incredible army and we now face the inevitable clash between the powerful Roman legions and the courageous band of rebels. On the Roman side we have Marcus Crassus and also an unexpected but awesome appearance from arguably the most famous person in Ancient Roman history.  This last season is an incredible thrill ride and the series ends with some of the greatest large scale fight scenes I have ever seen. I will also get it out of the way and say that this is the first time I have ever cried at the end of an episode. The final episode is a tearjerker and it reminded me of how far the rebels came for the reason of freedom.

The entire series is amazing and if I was to only review the series itself, it would get a full 5 stars.

On to the special features. All the special features from the previous stand alone season blu rays are here as well a few extras. I haven't seen all of them but I believe it gives more bang for your buck.

The box set itself is pretty crappy. I expected all the seasons to be separated in their own mini boxes but all of them are basically crammed into a mini booklet almost like a little photo album. If you look at other box sets, especially the breaking bad barrel, this would look like someone found empty cardboard and used that to put all the discs in.

As a whole, this complete series is great and if you haven't watched the series or are a fan, I would definitely recommend this.",1412380800,135,4006,4.4576502732240435
5571832,5,B00BBUNUOG,"When I found this limited edition I decided to preorder it, I am a huge fan of Spartacus since it began.
This collector's edition came in a nice box, the statue is about 8 inches wide and 7 inches tall, nice paint job and detailed
The discs came in some kind of book, each one in a ""page"", luxury one
Well, for $179.99 is nice, but it's a shame that the prize haven't changed (still the same, it says that normally is $199.99), that's my only complaint, because I did not get any benefict by preordered it
If you like blood, sex, gore, action, drama and more sex, Spartacus is the one for you
RIP Andy",1411430400,15,601,4.189655172413793
5571833,5,B00BBUNUOG,"Over the past several years, Ive had the privilege of reviewing a few of the Spartacus seasons.  I say privilege because the opportunity was just that.  I fell in love with this show after the first episode of the first season (Blood and Sand), and I will state it is still one of my favorite titles to date.  It should come as no surprise, then, to hear SPARTACUS: THE COMPLETE SERIES is the Holy Grail for me.  This epic Blu-ray set is a must-own for existing fans of the show and even newbies who have never watched it.

The fine folks at Starz definitely knew what they were doing when they first premiered this epic series.  Spartacus strikes a chord with everybody because of the timeless themes it covers.  Rebellion, love, loyalty, revengethese are all present in this series and form the foundation on which the drama builds.

As Ive stated before,  SPARTACUS: THE COMPLETE SERIES is impressive on many levels.  It is visually amazing, the bloodshed and gore are superb, the drama is intense, and the acting is top notch.  But the storyline never gets old, either.  The plot moves at a rapid pace, but not so fast as to lose the audience.  The result is an amazing show that is as engrossing as it is vicious.

SPARTACUS: THE COMPLETE SERIES is a huge win for me, and Im so thankful to have been given the chance to cover it.  If you're an existing fan, you will want to snatch this collection up immediately.  And if you're new to the show, this will be a great way to binge-watch all of the seasons in a single weekend.  Regardless, add this to your Must Buy list today.",1411430400,37,1581,4.452961672473868

5571835,3,B00BBUNUOG,"This is a review for the box set, not the show itself. If you want a review for the show, go to a movie/tv site, not a shopping site. The reason I rated it so low is because, for such an epic show, this is a pathetic box set. It's cheap and it feels it. You open it up and it has plastic spacers on the top and bottom and in the middle is the booklet featuring the discs. It's sad. At least you get a bunch of good features and all of the episodes.",1410912000,9,448,3.7263157894736842
5571836,3,B00BBUNUOG,"I got this at Best Buy on the US release date of Sept 16 2014 for about 80 bucks. I seen half of the series on Starz so knew I would wait for the complete series edition. So here it is. 5 stars for the blood and gore. Minus 3 stars for the thoughtless and cheap boxing of the set. If you seen the set HBO did for Rome, you will know what I am talking about. Starz is no HBO. This is all cheap cardboard that looks like it will fall apart. The prints used in the booklet that holds the actual disks look like it was printed from my home printer. Best Buy would not sell a Chinese ripped version, would they? Finally I'll add in another star because I can finally watch it all.",1410825600,11,675,3.934306569343066
