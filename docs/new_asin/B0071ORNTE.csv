8508527,4,B0071ORNTE,"'Patisserie Coin de rue' is an enjoyable film.  It opens with Natsume (Aoi Yu) arriving in Tokyo in search of her boyfriend, to whom she believes she is betrothed.  She arrives at what she believes is his place of employment, the pastry shop, Patisserie Coin de rue, only to find out he wasn't able to meet their expectations and had left.  Without knowing where he is, she has no place to go and pleads for a job having previously made cakes for her family's business.

Natsume is given an opportunity to prove herself to the owner, staff and former pastry chef, turned pastry critic, Tomurasan (Eguchi Yosuke).  Unfortunately, the cake she made for them to sample is somewhat derisively deemed good enough for 'Christmas cakes', but not sufficient for the pastry/art the shop creates.  She pleads with them to reconsider, and they finally relent.  She is hired as a novice and allowed to live on the premises.

Her struggles continue to evolve along with her pleading which at times is excessive.  However, it moves the story forward as she convinces Tomurasan to help her and by helping her begins to work through a painful event in his own past.  Ultimately, by supporting and relying on each other, they both find a new beginning in their lives.

The only downside to this film (other than the excessive pleading) pertains to the supporting characters.  I don't feel they were fully developed and sometimes left you wondering how they fit into the storyline exactly.

All in all, it is definitely worth seeing.  You probably should pick up some pastries before you watch 'Patisserie Coin de rue' as you will definitely be craving them after the film.

One note of caution if you have children, there is one scene which could be inappropriate for younger audiences related to the tragic event experienced by Tomurasan.  It was horrific even for me.",1350691200,2,1852,4.813291139240507
