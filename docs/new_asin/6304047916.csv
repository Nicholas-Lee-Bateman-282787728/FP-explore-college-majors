767092,5,6304047916,"From the box cover:

The Caribbean (the first VHS tape in this box set) is a portrait of chains of islands bathed by the beautiful Caribbean Sea and drenched in year-round sunshine.  From the native mystique of Jamaica to the beat of the steel drums on Trinidad to the underwater paradise of the Cayman Islands, the Caribbean is a magical place.  Enjoy the European flavor of the Virgin Islands, the tropical flowers of Martinique and the modern rush of Puerto Rico.  Each island is inviting, intriguing and inescapably fun.

Then spend some time in the Bahamas - the islands where pirates, slave traders and rum runners used to rub elbows.  Considered today as a premier vacation destination, the Bahamas have fabulous beaches, unparalleled shopping and some of the best coral reefs for diving anywhere in the world.  From carriage rides to Prince George Wharf to the dungeons of Fort Charlotte to fresh fish at Potters Cay fish market, Holiday in the Bahamas (the second VHS tape in this box set) is an enticing look at the endless possibilities of paradise.",1192838400,,1060,4.855555555555555

The sharp imagery of that format reveals all the little details in the jungle and shipboard scenery that the DVD format was unable to capture.

I am a Johnny Depp fan. The rest of the cast is just as fantastic!

Introduced the kiddies to it for the first time in less than a months time. As the credits rolled for the third movie, my son asked if we could go to the theater to go see the fourth one.

Something worth noting is that the seventh (7th) disc is simply in an envelope attached to the backside of the box. Despite being labeled ""Not For Individual Sale,"" The three movies do like they could simply be the three individual movies put together in a box. Price wise, however, the ""box set"" is much more affordable if looking to purchase all three movies.

Thank you Jack Sparrow for a positive Blu-Ray experience!",1312070400,2,834,4.396103896103896
768136,5,6304047916,"I had been relatively oblivious to these movies until the promotion surrounding ""On Stranger Tides"" (OST) captured the imagination of my 7-year-old son. After seeing OST, it didn't take too terribly much cajoling from my son to take the plunge (ARRR) and purchase the Trilogy preceding it.

I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by the continuity of the films and how well they work together as a group.  We've watched all three movies back-to-back on more than one occasion.  While, in my opinion, the movies are definitely targeted toward kids, if you're willing to suspend a little disbelief the stories are a lot of fun for adults too.  They are also funnier than I expected.  Because of the enormous publicity reach of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise I'm spare you another redundant Roger Ebert-esque movie review with specifics, but Johnny Depp (and the writers) do a really good job of creating a larger-than-life character without making a superhero out of him.  Also, it must be said that Keira Knightley is simply delightful.

In my case, the real fun of these movies has been witnessing the joy they have brought to my child.  He is now absolutely engrossed by all things Pirates of the Caribbean and has taken to exploring intellectually the historical fact & fiction surrounding the tales.

The book is beatiful and well made, not flimsy
comes with the 3 movies, the bonus discs and a bonus disc
but whats cool is that the bonus disc is housed inside a compass and this compass isn't flimsy either
but to get to the discs one must go through the pirates code with a beautfiul tapestry like bookmark
its really cool
it is missing digital copies except were there ever offered before in either blu ray or dvd

i plan on getting the pirates chest as well because it comes with the 3d, blu ray, dvd and digital copies of all  4 films

but that one does not have a release date and most likey several months away

this is a must
for the packaging alone
its the pirates code bound in the book

768318,5,6304047916,"Just so this is 100% clear, this is for the Seven-Disc Blu-ray version released 3/1/11.

The set includes 7 discs, one for each movie, containing the movie, one for each movie, containing extras and a 7th disc, which is basically more extras and a preview of the 4th movie.

The packaging of this set is awful. The seventh disc is in an envelope that bulges out from back of the storage box. Thinking it was attached with easy to remove rubber glue, I tried to peel it off. I was horrified to find out that a) it won't easily peel off without ripping the box b) there's a giant blank silver reflective patch under it (practically the size of the entire back of the box) and c) the envelope is attached at the bottom of the box and cannot be separated without cutting. For anyone planning to keep this on their shelf, do NOT try to remove the cheap outer envelope. Personally, all my discs are going into a different storage system, so the box was headed to the trash anyway. Just wanted to give everyone some fair warning about the poor packaging. On to the good...

I am not a huge fan of these movies content. The first one is decent, the second is tolerable and the third is downright terrible. Rather than bash poor writing and the other host of problems with the movie, let me say this: these Blu-rays look and sound absolutely incredible. In the first movie, there's a scene in the beginning where Elizabeth Swan is waking up from her dream about rescuing William Turner as a child. There is a candle in the room. I can hear the candle flickering on the surround sound. There are many other great instances on this film: sails flapping in the wind, waves lapping, wind blowing, ships creaking. I have no Blu-ray movies that are truly 100% immersive, this set is as close as it gets. The action scenes are also great. They didn't overdo the bass or LFE at all, like most action films unfortunately do. The fact that the audio is produced in full lossless LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 24-bit) makes a huge difference. Visually, the movie is just as stunning. Disney is well known for doing an awesome job of porting their movies to Blu-ray and this is no exception. This is truly a reference quality set of movies and I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to show off their home theater system and put it through its paces.

This is, by far, the best looking Blu-ray set I've ever seen. If you want to see the future of home theater, buy this set. Absolutely awesome.",1301356800,15,2470,4.445916114790287

Also, some people complain that these are the same disks you would get if you bought the trilogy separately. Each movie is a 2-disc set with lots of special features. What more do you want? A 12-disc set that costs twice as much? How much special features do most people really watch, anyway? If you're unhappy with the trilogy boxed set, then buy the movies separately or wait for the next release with all the special features you want.

As for the movies, they were pretty good. But the reason I keep watching them is not so much the plot or the direction or the special effects. I watch because I think this is Johnny Depp at his best. He is extraordinary in these films and so much fun to watch. I actually think all the actors are pretty good in these films. The casting people did a great job.

The discs really are great.  However, an important note, you must proactively select the Uncompressed LPCM soundtrack in the SETUP menu every time you watch.  Apparently, because the hi-res is uncompressed Disney was worried about compatibility (or maybe it's a blu-ray spec?) and they made plain-old Dolby Digital the default.

Update: 10/25/10  After watching these a few times now, I've had several instances where the menus do not load properly.  I have to eject and restart, sometimes multiple times.

I liked it so much, I gave the standard dvd away and bought it again on Blu-ray. You won't believe how great it looks in HD. The water looks like you could reach out and touch it. The unortodox style of drunken master acting that only J.Depp can bring to a character of this caliber was a long way from his 21 jumpstreet days. I am glad he made a comeback. O. Bloom is the good-guy to Depps reluctant hero roll. They had one of the best (samuria included) sword fights I have see in a loooong time. A three man fight you won't soon forget. Its funny but with a lot of cool moves The young lady was pretty good but if they choose her replacement carefully(unlike the MUMMY)she can be replaced. I hope Bloom changes his mind and comes back. The 3rd was my favorite. Overall I was really happy with the boxset. I only wish I would have known about amazon back then I would have saved a few buck$. But too late now.

I also have the DVD's of the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, and in comparing Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, it is clear that the Blu-Ray is better than the DVD version. Though the DVD is good, and no doubt better than watching it with a regular tv and dvd player, the Blu-Ray version is clearer and crisper, and not as blurry. On the Blu-Ray version, you can practically see every miniscule detail of the movie, which is unlike on the DVD version, which is good, yet blurry compared to the Blu-Ray version.
I have also read that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl had some format issues in the earlier made versions of the movie, where apparently the heads of Jack and Will are cut off when they are fighting on the rafters at the beginning of the movie. But fret not, Pirates of the Caribbean buyers, it has proved that Disney truly re-released the movie and have fixed this problem on new ones. Just buy from amazon (which is the cheapest anyway) and you are assured a one made later on.

""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" Review:
This is the strongest of the 3 films. Although each film definitely has somewhat of a ""fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants"" type story style (as if there were no strong script, but rather ideas that popped up on set), this one actually works and makes for a very fun viewing experience. Pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, who created this legendary film character) teams up with blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to help rescue the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from pirate Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Of course there is treasure involved as well as a curse. Depp walks away with the picture. The love interest (Bloom & Knightley) do their best to compete, but without Depp, this picture would have tanked. Amazing special effects and plenty of swashbuckling action!

Extras :
* 3 Audio commentary tracks: #1 is director Gore Verbinski & Johnny Depp; #2 is producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Keira Knightley, and Jack Davenport; #3 is co-screenwriters Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert
* Lots of trailers, including one for POTC 3 in HD 1080p
* ""An Epic at Sea: The Making of Pirates of the Caribbean"" which is a 9-part 38 minute documentary.
* ""Fly on the Set"" documentary which describes in greater depth 5 different sequences in the film (""The Town Attack,"" ""Tortuga,"" ""The Blacksmith Shop,"" ""The Cave"" and ""Jack's Hanging"")
* ""Moonlight Serenade Progression"" which shows from pre-production to the final scene of how the spectral pirates came to be
* 3 on-set ""diaries"": Producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ""Photo Diary"" (4 min.), ""Diary of a Pirate"" (9 min.), featuring actor Lee Arenberg (Pintel), and ""Diary of a Ship"" (8 min.) by the crew of the real Lady Washington, which was used as the H.M.S. Interceptor in the film
* 19 deleted scenes
* Blooper reel
* Vintage ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" (Jan. 1968) excerpt describing how the Disneyland attraction came to be, and includes a ""ride-through"" of the attraction itself.
* Photo/image gallery
* ""Scoundrels at Sea"": customize your viewing experience with this exclusive-to-Blu-ray feature, allowing you to access trivia, clips, etc. on your own. A lot of work, but can add a little fun to repeated viewings.
* And plenty of Easter Eggs!

""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" Review:
Although it has its moments and plenty of wonderful special effects, I felt that this one was somewhat of a disappointment. The Jack Sparrow character is not quite as quirky as he is in the first film, but rather a little overdone. This film has a feeling of being made up as it was being filmed. Too much explanation of plot twists and too many intricate ribbons to tie together things that were not originally intended to be tied together...this franchise officially begins to bloat with this 2nd installment. This time, Jack Sparrow must lift the curse of eternal damnation by recovering the heart of the slimy Davy Jones, which is inside the Dead Man's Chest. Stabbing the heart would not only destroy Jones, but also set free Will Turner's father, Bootstrap Bill.

Extras :
* 1 Audio commentary track with co-screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio
* Lots of trailers, including one for POTC 3 in HD 1080p
*  ""Charting the Course"" is a 26 minute pre-production documentary
* ""According to Plan: The Harrowing and True Story of Dead Man's Chest"" is a 63 minute look at the actual filming, which was plagued with many a problem (and shows in the final product)
* ""Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend"" (13 min.) shows how actor Bill Nighy was transformed into the octopus-like character Davy Jones
* ""Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage"" (4 min.)
* ""Mastering the Blade"" (16 min.) shows how the stars learned to swashbuckle with swords
*  ""Captain Jack: From Head to Toe"" (22 min.) shows how Jack Sparrow was costumed...very cool to see the attention to detail.
* ""Dead Men Tell New Tales: Re-Imagineering the Attraction"" (13 min.) shows how the Disneyland attraction was changed to include characters from the film (interesting to see Depp come face to face with his Audio Animatronic counterpart)
* ""Pirates on Main Street"" (4 minutes) shows the premiere at Disneyland
* ""Jerry Bruckheimer: A Producer's Photo Diary"" (5 min.) shows stills from the production
* ""Liar's Dice"" a blu-ray exclusive game with dice
* And plenty of Easter Eggs!

""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" Review:
This is one of those movies that requires multiple viewings to appreciate it and catch all of the nuances. I was not bowled over by it the first time I saw it, and still think that it could have been tightened up quite a bit in the editing room, however, it is a nice end to the trio of POTC movies. It seemed like the pressure to make this installment better than the others is felt throughout; the first movie was nothing but a joyful and spontaneous romp with Jack Sparrrow and his supporting characters. By installment 3, you sense an almost over-manufactured quality, as if the franchise is on steroids. The comments by the crew in the extras almost bear this out; especially in the Tale of Many Jacks featurette. ""How do we keep it unexpected?"" the crew asks, responding, ""Maike it weird."" However, the weird becomes ""tedious"" (the word they use to describe the filming of the scene), and especially when watching the multiple Jack sequence, I kept asking myself ""Why is this scene necessary?"" Although it is technically brilliant, it really does nothing to further the plot along, and just adds to the yawn factor. One thing Walt Disney really understood was good storytelling; even though a sequence maybe astounding, if it doesn't integrate into the whole, it should be removed. There are 2 deleted scenes on the disk; ""I Like Riddles"" and ""Two Captains, One Ship."" The 2 Captains scene is extremely fun to watch as you see the competition between Barbossa and Sparrow. It has the light playful feeling that was part of the original, but somewhat gone in part 3. And as most probably know, you must watch the movie even AFTER the credits...there is a short scene at the end that wraps the bow up even more neatly to complete the trilogy. Without giving away a plot spoiler, I have to say that the final sequence before the credits gave me hope that if there is another installment, that the producers realized they need to focus on Sparrow and cut the weight of all the extra storylines: the love story of Will and Elizabeth, the Chinese Pirates, the Brethren Court, Tia Dalma, etc...it is just too much.

Extras :
* Bloopers
* Lots of trailers
* Deleted scenes
* ""Anatomy of a Scene: The Maelstrom"" (20 min.) An in depth look at this amazing scene.
* ""Masters of Design"" (25 min.) 5 featurettes which describe the Costuming (Keith Richards amazing wardrobe by Penny Rose), Sao Feng's Map, The Code Book, Crash McCreary: The Cursed Crew, and Rick Heinrichs: Singapore.
* ""The Tale Of The Many Jack"" (5 min.) shows how this bizarre (and superfluous) scene created multiple Jack Sparrows.
* ""The World of Chow Yun Fat"" (5 min.) is a little odd in that he speaks Mandarin with subtitles, but still interesting, as it enlightens us as to what a presence he is and how he pretty much brought his own methods of filming/working to the project and was allowed to do so because he is such an international star.
* ""Keith & the Captain: On Set With Johnny And The Rock Legend"" (5 min.) is lots of fun; almost like a train wreck as the poor man speaks unintelligibly, but he is still magic when he picks up a guitar and starts to strum.
*  ""The Pirate Maestro: The Music of Hans Zimmer"" (10 min.) is another case of being pressured; you hear how he also wants to outdo the previous films. Interesting to watch one of the musicians play a saw and then see Verbinski jamming on an electric guitar.
