2353242,3,B000A2XBKY,"I love the guys.  Call 'em what yas want: Dead End Kids, Bowery Boys, ""The Amazing Aging Teens""--I've loved 'em my whole life.  If you can't appreciate the esprit d' corps and bother hood of these ""never let a pal down"" chums, than there is simply something seriously wrong with your central pump, bud!

My problem--as Slip would 'interjoist'--is quite 'simplastically' dis: do I buy dis set or don't I?  I DO care about DVD production quality--particularly as I have just been treated to a more than two month ""7 A.M. Saturday Morning Matinee"" by TCM of virtually pristine quality dubs of one Bowery Boy classic after another.

So, as my title pleads to know: What's the straight skinny on des here DVDs?!  I've got two joes telling me they are ""*****"" in solid gold quality and describing all sorts of nifty packaging, etc.  And I got two mugs whats callin' this set a ""*"" stinker to be avoided at all costs!

What's the straight skinny fer cryin' out loud?!  Could somebody out der grab a stoop for five minutes and put a guy on the level?  I'd sure like to buy dese if dere any good.  But I ain't lookin' t' get da bum's rush an' end up wid no tomato cans.  How's about a deciding, tie-breaker vote from some slick in da know?

Tanks a million, fellas!",1297555200,13,1256,4.432314410480349
2353243,1,B000A2XBKY,"The video quality was very poor. It had very dark images, with poor to fair quality of sound. I would not recommend spending the money on this set! Unless you are a big, big fan and just have to have something from the East side kids movies. I am very disappointed.",1240358400,19,265,4.215686274509804
2353244,1,B000A2XBKY,When I was a kid I would get up real early in the 60's to find THE BOWERY BOYS on tv. But I only saw part of the first movie and not even all of it. the pictures or cinematography were pretty crummy.,1219190400,6,199,3.6511627906976742
2353245,5,B000A2XBKY,"This is a great DVD, and higher quality than most of the others.

A thoughtful reviewer added the following but mistakenly added it as a comment on the first review (thus it doesn't show up for others to see unless they look at comments on the first review ;)  This way, all who look at reviews will see it:

""Packaged in a hardbound, cloth-covered case, this set includes the DVDs 'Neath Brooklyn Bridge (1941), Bowery Blitzkrieg (1941), Boys Of The City (1940), Clancy Street Boys (1943), Kid Dynamite (1943), Million Dollar Kid (1944), Mr. Wise Guy (1942), Smart Aleck (1942), Spooks Run Wild (1940) and That Gang Of Mine (1942).""

8073098,3,B000A2XBKY,"There are two types of people- those that like the East Side/Dead End/Bowery Boys movies and those that don't.
If you fall into the former, then the question becomes - how bad is the print? These are not bad prints, not great, but until somebody ponies up the money to do a professional remaster, it is the best we can get.
If you are a fan, enjoy- if not- save your money",1362355200,,372,4.180555555555555

8073103,3,B000A2XBKY,The quality of these DVDs aren't the best but its great to see (The boys) any time i want .It brings me back to those sunday mornings on channel 9 while my mom was cookin the macaroni and meatballs with her home made sauce. Between the shows and the smell of my moms cookin those were some of the best times of my life. I just wish they would put the Bowery Boys series on dvd so I could order them to. They were the best I use to feel like i was sitting in Louie's Sweet Shop with the Bowery Boys.,1325635200,2,498,3.892156862745098
