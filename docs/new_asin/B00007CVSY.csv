7975142,5,B00007CVSY,"If you love a great mystery movie this one's for you.  If you love a great suspense movie this one's for you.  Blind Terror has a terrific plot, is well directed and acted, and is rife with possible suspects and motives for the stalking of a very attractive and believable young woman who has suffered a horrible death of her first husband several years ago.  Plenty of shocks and surprises are in store for the viewer and the ending is in no way ""telegraphed"" right up to the movie's stunning conclusion.  We found this gem in of all places a bargain bin and consider it a fine keeper and addition to our collection.",1226793600,2,617,4.433628318584071
7975143,4,B00007CVSY,"I felt sorry for Nastassja Kinski's (To The Devil A Daughter, Cat People) character in BLIND TERROR. I mean, she loses her husband on their anniversary! She's also got to deal with her cranky sister, who just happens to have married the world's most brutal idiot! Nastassja even gives her sister thousands of dollars to support this total loser! Sheesh! Then, two years after her husband's sudden demise, she finds herself falling in love with a guy who seems perfect in every way. Has our heroine finally found happiness? Nah, some nut starts stalking her almost immediately! This leads to vandalism, assault, and murder. This woman cannot catch a break! Who is the culprit? Why are they torturing our Nastassja? All is revealed in the end. I like BT, especially for a TV movie. I did find it humorous that the cover warns that this film is ""FOR MATURE AUDIENCES. CONTAINS ADULT LANGUAGE, ADULT CONTENT AND VIOLENCE."" From this description I was expecting something like the uncut version of BASIC INSTINCT! Well, there's zero nudity, no gore, and the language is of the usual network TV variety! So, don't be fooled by the silly, totally misleading disclaimer! The movie is good anyway...",1209772800,2,1190,4.896039603960396
