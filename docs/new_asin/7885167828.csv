7900378,1,7885167828,"Both package and seller didn't describe clearly in the product details that this is not ""movie/computerized animation"" type cartoon.
When I got it and open the first disc, it was ""doll"" type cartoon that narrator does the most talking in it.
Since I got a another different Thomas Train cartoon (computerized-animation), I just returned it.
If you like the lively cartoon just like the ""movie"" cartoon, do grab another one which I just newly bought
called Thomas & Friends 3D - 5 DVDs - Part 1 (Mandarin Chinese Edition) with ASIN: 7798982027.
Finally I got the right one for the Thomas & Friends.",1398816000,2,597,4.805825242718447
7900379,5,7885167828,We were looking for more Mandarin language cartoons for our son and were a bit surprised to find this on Amazon. This is definitely a Chinese style product with all of the discs in a typical plastic flap and tons of episodes on each DVD. If you've ever traveled to Asia and seen how the street vendors sell TV series and the like this will be familiar to you. As for the content these are the English language episodes from the original series with both English and Mandarin language tracks available. Also available are Simplified Chinese subtitles. Great purchase just to have some more Chinese immersion in the house besides just my wife speaking to him.,1370476800,,657,4.672413793103448
7900380,5,7885167828,"It worked in my xbox dvd player!  So I'm super happy.  My son loves Thomas so he's super happy. Win-win.  Everything is in chinese when you load in the dvd, but it's such a simple menu that I was able to figure it out despite my illiteracy- the numbered titles are the different episodes.  At the bottom you can click on the option to listen to everything in english or mandarin. I forgot which was which, but it's just trial and error.  Happy!",1357171200,2,444,4.301204819277109
7900381,5,7885167828,I didn't realize that it would have the option to listen in English but it does so that is VERY helpful!  Hours and hours of Thomas so be ready for it to drive you a little crazy if you don't have a high tolerance for that kind of thing.,1317254400,,237,3.836734693877551
