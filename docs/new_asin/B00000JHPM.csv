Mr. Kennedy (introduced in the first Hornblower movie, The Duel) returns as a shattered prisoner-of-war, which gives Hornblower another dimension and gives Jamie Bamber (Kennedy) a great venue for exhibiting his incredible acting skills.  The story is engaging and tense (although the ending is a little abrupt - unless you watch the next movie!).  It's wonderful to see a woman interact with the characters, and Cherie Lunghi is wonderful as the Duchess (especially the accent) - she also has some great lines!  Definitely worth seeing over and over!",974505600,,616,5.191919191919192
