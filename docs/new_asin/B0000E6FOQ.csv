1937900,5,B0000E6FOQ,I have bought a few yoga dvds trying to find one that works for me. I am over 50 so my balance and flexibility have been an issue. This workout is not too difficult for me. I have not been that active so I had sore muscles the first few times I used it. Would definitely recommend this if you have not tried yoga. It is an easy beginner workout.,1361923200,5,345,3.942857142857143

8002207,5,B0000E6FOQ,I first started using this in the VHS version back in the late 90's. It was my first attempt at trying yoga and I absolutely loved it! The yoga in this dvd has a great flow to it and is easy for beginners. I bought this DVD because I fell out of practice in the last couple of years and immediately thought of this particular video to get me back into it. I would definitely recommend this DVD for yoga beginners.,1458518400,,413,4.111111111111111

It is visually and mentally calming..  I still can't do all the positions, but I feel much better.  My back is now pain free.
