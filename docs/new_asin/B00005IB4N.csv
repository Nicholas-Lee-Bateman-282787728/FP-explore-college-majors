7938205,4,B00005IB4N,Very slow easy to learn only thing i don't like is that they only do half her face and than cut to a full face and also they don't say all the colors that are used on her skin she she is my complexion and i would like to know so i can do the same thing to my face. She is a beautiful model at the end of the tape they take her from looking like a plain jane to a beauty queen its cute just need more information and more time!,1085097600,2,426,3.5913978494623655

I don't consider myself a beginner but I'm not advanced either. This video is for everyone. I am very pleased with it.",1067990400,2,259,4.416666666666667
7938207,5,B00005IB4N,"Since we don't have schools to teach beauty techniques in Saudi Arabia, I ordered some tapes and books from Amazon, so I can start a small business.  Basic Makeup VHS was the best cause you can learn all the small details.  I learned from it all the small details for having a perfect makeup.  If you want to have a perfect, simple and professional make up just go ahead and order this high quality tape.",1043020800,3,404,4.36
