It is a great pity that this was the final season, I hope they revisit and make a new series based on this since there are so few ""girl heroes"" series out right now.",1389398400,,243,4.304347826086956
8599205,5,B00DYEBLS4,"Get ready to ""WOOHP"" it up with teen dreams Sam, Clover, and Alex in the second season of ""Totally Spies"", the hit girl-powered action series as seen on Cartoon Network. Sure, these gals may face some typical social-based problems, but they're nothing compared to the vile villains they encounter. The second volume ""Fame and Fashion"" has the last 13 season two episodes on two discs such as:

""Stark Raving Mad"" - Wild parties are being held in certain, yet unusual places all over Beverly Hills.  When our girls go to investigate, it turns out that the emcee for those raves is a familiar villain !
""S.P.I."" - A new spy organization is putting WOOHP out of business.  Sam becomes suspicious about the new organization, but no one seems to believe her.
""Animal World"" - Animals are exhibiting human behaviour, while people are acting like animals.  The girls must find the mad scientist behind this scheme or else Clover will be acting like a dog forever !
""Alex Quits"" - A new, albeit prettier, spy in training joins the three girls on their next mission, but Alex get a little self-conscious on account of her many foul-ups on their previous missions which prompts her to leave WOOHP altogether.
""Totally Switched"" - As if Clover's personality being swapped with a dog's was bad enough, another villain has her switched with Jerry's personality !
""The Elevator"" - Clover's date gets cut off when the girls chase a bad guy and wind up stuck in an elevator.  While they try to find a way out, the girls start having flashbacks of their many adventures together.
""Matchmaker"" - A new dating service has put girls like Alex and Sam with their perfect match.  And Clover, who's established a dating hiatus, has a sneaky suspicion about the girls' dates.
""Brain Drain"" - Sam competes in a game show, but is rendered dumb afterwards.  Therefore, Clover and Alex must investigate what goes on during the show.
""Fashion Faux Pas"" - Devious designer Helga Von Guggen returns and her new line of clothing is about to get a little tight.  And by tight, I mean clothes that suddenly squeeze the life right out of you !

You'll need the other volume of season two to complete this season of the girls from Beverly Hills with awesome adventures, by the way. And don't forget that the first season is also available on DVD, and coming soon, season three !",1384214400,,2342,4.692682926829268
