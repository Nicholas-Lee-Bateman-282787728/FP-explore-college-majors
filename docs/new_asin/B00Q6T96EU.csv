8690595,4,B00Q6T96EU,As a film fan this was a great look at a low cost production process. The leads were more interesting than the films they directed. Because my son was in the theatre program at Point Park College it was fascinating to see familiar territory and local locations.,1519344000,,261,4.574468085106383

8690597,4,B00Q6T96EU,"Two aspiring film makers are invited to Pittsburg, each are given the same script and are allowed to alter it a bit and make a feature film. Zachary Quinto is a producer and mentor as the two aspiring directors assemble a staff, cast the actors, and scout locations. Tempers occasionally run short and swearing is heard. Insightful.

Watching production makes a person want to watch the movies to see how they turn out and how they compare.",1439164800,,795,7.548387096774194

8690599,5,B00Q6T96EU,"Nice show. The Shane fella is hard to watch, but still an interesting choice for a reality subject. Having been a fan of all three seasons of Project Greenlight, I'd love to see Chris Moore find some decent material to lure an A-list star with on a low-budget SAG rate. I think they'd have a better chance of selling the project (on both ends) as a dedicated actor's piece, particularly with some help from the Brothers Weinstein. Probably not the most original thought, but it's mine. With regard to this series, I'm glad they included both finished movies. Granted, I highly doubt it would have been distributed otherwise, but for those watching the show, it seems like a no-brainer. Overall, a good value to a niche market.",1426032000,,726,4.724409448818897
