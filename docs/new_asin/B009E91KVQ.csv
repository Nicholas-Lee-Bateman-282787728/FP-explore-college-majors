8747639,4,B009E91KVQ,"The video focuses on offense.  No defensive advice to counter the offensive moves that are demonstrated.  There are also some very important points to playing the position that are not discussed until the end of the video or are buried in the middle of some of the drills.  Overall, the offensive demonstrations are well explained and well video taped.  They also repeat the drills multiple times.  I thought that the price of the video was a bit steep for what was actually contained in it.  I was expecting more than some offensive drills, but there are several good pieces of advice within the video.",1420243200,,603,4.75
