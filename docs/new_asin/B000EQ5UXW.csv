8113019,3,B000EQ5UXW,"Geneshaft is a story of what the future will be like if it was run and controlled by a tiny secret group of men, and the glory of enhanced genetics, basically controlling a selected population of enhanced humans; 80% woman and 20% men. A mystery alien race of giants wipes itself out with technology and now that same technology threatens to wipe out Earth. It is up to the main character to save the Earth and discover her destiny and humanities new path. It has a disturbing back story, poor development, a pointless plot, and great characters and characters development. The story never goes no where until the last three episodes. Main point of the whole story is about self-determination and girls.

8113020,5,B000EQ5UXW,"I totally agree with what the main characters think towards the value of human beings. The background is set in the 23rd century, the human beings are considered as something mechanic and manipulated creatures whose existence is only for the well being of their so-called 'world' and 'human beings' ironically. The characters need to rethink and overcome this dubious idea while finding out what the enemy is (the ring), its appearance and the purpose in attacking the ship. When I was watching this anime, I could not resist from recalling how some companies attempted to develop some technology in controlling our minds (brainwaves, etc) in being addicted to their products. This is possible but not very useful because so far, we have other things more superior and mysterious. There is no formula in categorizing what we like or what we hate from time to time. This is manipulation which is detested by us. The story of the anime more or less wants to express the uniqueness and freedom of human beings, not only with our mind but with everything we own. There are more intrinsic and difficulty but interesting things we need to deal with in performing oue own lives, apart from computerizing the DNA and manipulation only.",1173916800,2,1227,4.903846153846154
8113021,3,B000EQ5UXW,"This anime is somewhat short for a series. Having only 13 episodes, a lot of content is glossed over and barely sufficient depth is given to character development. To those that prefer action over content, such a loss is a boon, but to those that prefer substance over flash, it is a major determent. As to the occasional action scenes, they contain really nothing notable visually, even though this is a relatively new anime. Computer Graphics are primarily used throughout, but there really are no scenes that will make you say ""wow, I can't believe how real/great that looks!"" Concerning the plot, while being somewhat novel, heart-warming, and intriguing, it unfortunately offers little lasting impact. All in all, this series is worth watching and renting, but has little to no replay value -- an essential element to most anime fans. At least the series is available at a great price.

Note: This review compares this series to the likes of Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Last Exile, Escaflowne, Hellsing, Rahxephon, and Neon Genies Evangelion.",1160611200,11,1041,5.0523255813953485
