1808744,4,B00007G1YJ,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my wife, who has recently picked up photography as a hobby.  We both feel like we've spent 90 minutes in the presence of a brilliant, fascinating, passionate visionary.  We are amazed at his life and work.  In short, this documentary does what any good, short documentary should do: It makes you want to know Adams and his work better.
PROS:
* Nice biography of Adams' life, highlighting the role his father played in facilitating Ansel's self-directed learning as a youth, his introduction to photography, his marriage (with its ups and downs), etc.  We were able to see what drove Ansel Adams.
* Need I say anything about his work?  There has never been and never will be another photographer like Adams.  This documentary just makes me want to sit in front of his photos for hours!
* Insights into how his photography and extensive time in the wilderness shaped his philosophy/worldview.
* Insights into how he exposed and developed photographs to reveal what he saw as he took the pictures--his embrace of realism.
CONS:
* The television screen is not an ideal place to view Adams' photos.  Ric Burns did a great job of panning and zooming to allow us to experience Adams' work, but if you're really interested in Adams, you need to buy some of his prints or a coffee table book or find a museum with a collection of Adams photos.  This is not Ric Burns fault--he did an amazing job telling this story.
PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION:
If you are interested in Ansel Adams, photography, or even just interested in art and the creative process, this is an excellent film.  Highly recommended.",1060560000,46,1629,4.74822695035461
1808745,1,B00007G1YJ,"Stay away from this DVD. This DVD is a long somber story with constant dramatic violins humming in the background. It is the perfect tone for a warmovie but not for a documentary on Ansel Adams. Adams himself isn't really present in this film (he has about three lines of text), although there is enough footage available.  Adams was a still photographer but don't expect any still photo's. Al his images are zoomed in and out and panned up and down and left and right.
If you want to see a artist at work and the work he made you better buy the DVD Art Wright made with a simpel 16mm camera about Brett Weston.",1059350400,12,611,4.3130434782608695

1808810,4,B00007G1YJ,"First, I'll be very upfront that this particular film cries out for a blu ray version. Even at full ""HD"" resolution (roughly equivalent to a 2-megapixel image), the video medium cannot begin to do justice to Adams' work, but the improvement from DVD resolution would make a dramatic difference in the viewing experience.

The film itself is a fairly straightforward account of Adams' life and career, including interviews with the right people. I didn't feel the need for quite so much exploration of Adams' personal life, but recognize that others may differ and the writers and director have the right to tell the story their way. Where the film is at its best is in the account of how Adams' work opened the door to consideration of photography as true art. The images and their stories are the stars of the show, and it is hard to watch this film without feeling a strong urge to seek out a gallery with real Ansel Adams prints and just camp out in front of them.

On balance, the film is worthwhile and at times moving. It is definitely worth the investment to see it for the first time.",1382400000,3,1092,4.566326530612245

1808835,4,B00007G1YJ,interesting history. Iconic images. Certainly worthy of seeing over and over. His landscape images are iconic and always will be,1367107200,,128,5.45
1808836,5,B00007G1YJ,"I just watched this documentary today, and I found it beautiful and intimate. Now, there were image after image of Ansel's photography, but really not so much of Ansel himself, particularly early on in life. They recycled what few images they had of him often. I just loved the story of his life, what a different child he was from any other and how his father really nurtured his son in order to meet Ansel's unique needs. Even Ansel himself said that if he was a child today, he'd get diagnosed with hyperactivity (or even something else). I didn't know he played the piano. I did not know much about him at all, and I felt film was a fair representation of his life. I greatly enjoyed it. I'm only sorry I was not alive during his lifetime to hear him speak about Mother Nature as well as the nature of an artist.",1365638400,,816,4.339869281045751
1808837,5,B00007G1YJ,"I have long been an admirer of Ansel's photography, but had never learned much about how he did it or how he lived. So one night a few years ago while flipping TV channels, I came upon the last half of this documentary film being shown on my local PBS station. I thought that it was so well written and produced that a few days later I bought the DVD in a local chain bookstore. Since then I have watched it countless times because I like it so much.

This film intimately describes Ansel's life from his birth until his death, with so many interesting and great things in between. In addition to showing many of his iconic images, there are many photographs of him and even some videos of Ansel speaking during interviews. Here, I learned that he was very intelligent and eloquent in his speaking and in letters he wrote which were read by some of the film's narrators.

Recently a friend and I were talking about Ansel, so I decided it would be a great gift. I was unable to find it anywhere locally and fortunately I found it here at Amazon. My friend was thrilled to receive my gift! I would highly recommend this wonderfully done film !",1329782400,2,1141,4.377358490566038
1808838,5,B00007G1YJ,"This is a great documentary and so nicely presented. It is done by Ric Burns which, in and of itself, lets you know it is a quality piece of work. If you are interested at all in the life and work of Ansel Adams, you will really enjoy this. One aspect that it touches on, for instance, is that Ansel was originally going to go to school for music, as he was a very talented pianist. He changed his mind and went to the mountains instead and with that decision, changed the history of photography and the way we all look at photography & nature today. Aren't we all the better for it? I also came away from this film with something extra: A love of the music played in it and deciding to purchase the soundtrack (which is available on CD). It is also outstanding; a wonderful surprise which, whenever I listen, reminds me of seeing the film about this wonderful man and his relationship with the vastness of nature and how he shared it with all of us. Highly recommended.",1325721600,2,970,4.335164835164835
1808839,2,B00007G1YJ,"Boy am I out of step when I compare my reaction to most of the others in this thread. You see, I am reviewing the movie, not Ansel Adams, and I find Ric Burns' film cold and unmoving once one removes oneself from the power of Adams' work. Burns benefits from the Kuleshov experiment in which the intercutting of still images produces an effect unrelated to the individual shots themselves. In this case, Burns' marvelous writing, interviewing, and interview subjects go on and on about Adams and his work but there is precious little specific discussion of the works that we're seeing at the time. A few -- the moon over graveyard, moon over Half Dome -- are addressed, and that's a strength, but minimal explanation is given to Adams' technique of burning/dodging prints, his filters, his camera, and even the tonal range of B&W film. If this had been about Rembrandt we would have had a thorough explanation of his brush strokes, pigments, and process. But somehow Adams' work takes place in the realm of magic. I don't have that much of a problem with panning and scanning the photos, except that the movement seldom ties in with the narration, it's just to keep the screen alive. David Ogden Stiers' narration is delivered with boring regularity, dropping the ends of sentences as if being merely perfunctory, until he becomes annoying. Worse, the breathtaking (and undoubtedly expensive) color helicopter shots over Adams' beloved Yosemite have nothing, of course, to do with Adams (color, moving, aerial) and serve to undercut the master's work at every bank. In the end, this documentary says everything about the man but explains little of how he achieved his results.",1309564800,15,1676,4.904929577464789
1808840,5,B00007G1YJ,"This DVD contains video that was directly copied from the PBS ""American Experience"" program. You can tell it was not touched up or enhance their fixed or anything else. I suspect that they were not planning on people having 46 inch televisions. The credits in the beginning part of the program are really fuzzy. But when it gets down to talking about Adams he gets down to talk about Adams and many of the photographs mysteriously get sharper. We get so engrossed in the subject matter both Adams and his pictures that we know longer care one way or the other were sharp or not.

My only complaint is that it was in a soundbite form. I don't know who designed the program that but they could have focused on one person or another instead of person A, and B, and C, and a, and B, and c, again and again and so forth so forth so forth. It breaks the continuity of thought.

For me the experience is enhanced because I've been to most of these places several times. I hope to go back again. I've also been intrigued with the mechanics of photography before it became the digital age. I'm now still interested in digital photography. But photography aside by the time that you get to the end of this program you will feel that you've lost your only friend.

This presentation gave me a different way of looking at life and being conservative with what nature has brought us.

1808841,4,B00007G1YJ,"Ansel Adams is a great video.  After seeing a showing of his pictures at a Tucson Museum we got excited about learning more about him.  He was truly a blessing to our country both in his photographs and his work in protection of our beautiful environment.  This is a very educational film and very enjoyable.  If you see it, try to find a place to view his photography.",1269993600,,369,4.382352941176471
1808842,5,B00007G1YJ,I recently saw an exhibit of Adams' work and wanted to learn more about him.  Saw this older film (from my public library) and was blown away.  Beautifully done and extremely moving.  Seeing his work on the screen is no substitute for seeing the real thing in a museum or gallery. but it is a wonderful additional piece to fill in a complete portrait of his life and work.  Every American should see this film and (hopefully) see his work in person.,1268870400,3,449,4.439024390243903
1808843,4,B00007G1YJ,I wanted this biography because it includes many of Adams' most famous photographs and it describes the lengths he went to to get them.  It's a great story in addition to being beautiful.,1259712000,,187,4.666666666666667
1808844,1,B00007G1YJ,"We are not allowed to see the photographs as Adams shot them. What we see instead are moving fragments as we are constantly subjected to panning, tilting and zooming in and out. We never see the photographs in total and get to watch them as Adams cropped them. It is like going through a photographic exhibition on a roller coaster.",1192406400,15,332,4.55
1808845,5,B00007G1YJ,"A stunningly beautiful biography.
I challenge any one to watch this and not shed tears for the beauty of this continent, and for what we have done and continue to do to it.
So many intensely fine photos of deep wilderness and sublime natural perfection matched by sensitive narration.
This film is a great work of art, and one of the most moving and gorgeous documentaries I have ever seen.
Ansel would approve...and his standards were the very highest.",1191196800,9,453,4.746835443037975
1808846,5,B00007G1YJ,"A captivating entry in the ""American Experience"" PBS series, ""Adams"" vividly brings to life the biographical details and working methods of this groundbreaking 20th-century photographer. An accomplished concert pianist, Adams gave up this path to pursue his vision of nature's beauty by illuminating Yosemite's Kings Canyon as it had never been seen before. With great sensitivity to Adams's process, specifically how he achieved the distinctive look of his photos, Burns handles his subject with understated reverence, profiling the artist-as-environmentalist. Adams changed forever the way we view wilderness, and this beautiful film tells us why--and why he and his legacy still matter.",1184716800,10,689,5.8316831683168315
1808847,4,B00007G1YJ,"The documental DVD talks about the important photographer Ansel Adams, very sensitive about the places he walked with his cameras and lenses, filters.

1808848,4,B00007G1YJ,"Ansel was an obsessive compulsive who had emotional and financial peaks and valleys that mirrored the contrasts within his photographic subject matter.

Many of the photos are breathtaking but cannot be adequately portrayed on screen; they are panned and zoomed to depict entire image but you lose the totality of the entire composition. Nevertheless, the documentary is a good introduction to a larger than life image on both ends of a camera lens.",1115424000,2,449,5.1506849315068495
1808849,5,B00007G1YJ,"A moving and very well-constructed tribute to Adams, the film doesn't shy away from things like his affairs, drinking, over-work, poverty, etc. But the film is all the stronger for this. Some of the most perceptive critics and fellow artists give great insight; as Adams himself rarely talked in any depth about his own work on camera or radio. His large images, most of which would look puny if shown whole on a TV screen, are made accessible by panning and zooming. The film has some absences (Adams sympathetic documenting of a Japanese PoW camp comes to mind), and some of the home-movie footage is used 'out of timeline', but overall it is a very satisfying portrayal of a complex artist.  If you like it first time around, you'll watch it again and again.",1104019200,7,761,4.67910447761194
1808850,5,B00007G1YJ,I've seen Ansel prints in the stores and in peoples homes but I never cared too much about the guy.  One quiet evening the documentary was on tv.  So I decided to give it a try. I was blown away by this man's life and body of work.  I rarely have seen a documentary that has moved me so deeply.  By panning and zooming a corner of a photo was a great peice unto itself.  There will never be another artist like it.  Everything after is merely an imitation of something great. I just decided to buy a copy for myself to show my friends and family.

7976045,4,B00007G1YJ,"As a biography, this is a top-notch effort.  But it doesn't convey the glory of Adams' prints and his technological contributions.  Resolution aside, Adams' careful cropping was often violated when prints were introduced by a video camera that instead of showing the full image, crawled slowly over the print, never showing more than about half of it at a time (what is referred to as the Ken Burns effect).  In fact, a viewer might not realize he was seeing an Adams masterwork till the camera happened to reveal all four edges of the image at the same time.  Also ignored was the technical innovation known as the zone system that Adams and Fred Archer refined into step-by-step procedures for adjusting film exposure and development to produce negative contrast that more predictably allows the resulting prints to match the photographer's concept of the scene.",1487462400,,864,5.020979020979021
