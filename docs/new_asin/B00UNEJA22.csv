7062959,5,B00UNEJA22,"This Movie was AMAZING!  My husband and I have not been married even 2 years yet. But we have had an exorbitant amount of issues that have hit. None of them small. When watching this movie, it felt like that tornado was our lives, in a symbolic way. We had no idea, what exactly we would be getting into while watching this movie. We have always loved the Lord, so we had no idea of the breaking that we would encounter in the end.
It was most timely for us and spoke to us on many levels. After the movie ended on our little computer, in our office, we dropped to our knees - BROKEN!  Thank you all for touching us, (and I am sure so many others.) Very touching and encouraging! What a Blessing! Thank you!",1433721600,7,707,4.153284671532846
7062960,5,B00UNEJA22,"A very powerful film. As you watch, you are drawn into the story and develop empathy for those who were afflicted by the tornados.

7062963,5,B00UNEJA22,"This is a super uplifting documentary about a tragic event. I hadn't read anything about it and was expecting basically a natural disaster documentary. I was movingly surprised. The production quality of the film is excellent. In it the stories of several devastated families are interwoven into a beautiful piece of art. I loved it so much, I bought some DVDs to give away and have planned a movie night at church. You may need tissues.",1448409600,,437,4.7631578947368425

7062967,5,B00UNEJA22,"I lived 23 of my 39 years in Norman, OK. I grew up there, and my children grew up there. We have family and many friends in Moore, OK. Some who lost their homes..and more on May 20, 2013.

I am a stormchaser. I find such beauty in the fury of mother nature, but until something like May 20, 2013, May 31, 2013
or even May 3, 1999 happens close at home, and touches  me personally, I sometimes don't stop to think about the people mother nature is effecting. The people in the closets covered with blankets, the mothers shielding their children, the countless amount of people praying they make it through......

This film is absoultely beautiful. It had such incredible stories of courage, strength, hope, love, and heartbreak. It
pulled at my heart strings over and over again. Tears were shed and pride was felt. Please consider watching/buying this
film, especially if you live in tornado alley. It will change your life.

7062968,5,B00UNEJA22,Documentary was well done.,1444694400,,26,5.75
7062969,1,B00UNEJA22,"This film is poorly made. It is heavy handed and monotonous. The filmmakers showed absolutely no restraint or critical thought here. An hour and a half of crying, sad music, and slow motion footage of rubble is not a documentary. It is a self indulgent and manipulative exercise, and a waste of time.

Please don't mistake my comments as dismissive of the events, the victims, or the stories of the people interviewed in this film. What I'm saying is that the filmmakers focused far too much on making the audience ""understand"" how ""sad"" this was, and ruined what could have been an interesting and thought provoking film.",1444521600,3,622,4.813084112149533
7062970,5,B00UNEJA22,"Good documentary of the Moore, OK 2013 tornado.  Watched it with the family and the littlest one prayed that the ""tormado"" would go back where it belongs.",1442534400,,154,4.703703703703703

7062974,5,B00UNEJA22,"Such a deep and humbling movie that shows the real life of people going through struggles that only God can bring comfort to. Had to hold the tears back. Would definitely recommend this to any person that has experienced hardship and struggle causing them to ask, where was/is God?",1441152000,3,281,4.755102040816326
7062975,5,B00UNEJA22,I live in Moore so the movie hit real close to home I actually knew one of the women who lost her life and the husband of on other. The movie was well done but did bring back painful memories but I am also amazed at how well people help each other through their own pain.,1438473600,2,271,3.857142857142857
7062976,5,B00UNEJA22,"The first half brought back memories of watching the storm chaser footage LIVE on the internet. Being from tornado alley, I could relate to their feelings of concern, fear & shock.  The production quality is top notch, those interviewed are real people...it gives the feeling that you are listening to a friend tell their experience. It addresses the question of ""Where Was God?"" in the middle of the storm in the way any one of us would process it and leaves you with a sense of peace and courage to face your own ""storms"".",1436313600,,524,4.574468085106383
7062977,5,B00UNEJA22,Great movie! Although was defiently a tear jerker.,1436140800,2,50,5.375
7062978,5,B00UNEJA22,"Where Was God? doesn't question the presence of God, it celebrates it! As one of the producers of this film, it was my honor to help capture the true stories of some of the people who survived one of the worst tornados in history. Their faith, in spite of suffering great loss inspired me, and I trust it will inspire you as well. The people in the film are not actors, and they bravely shared some very personal stories with hopes that they might be of encouragement to others to trust in God. We all have storms in life and at times are tempted to ask, ""Where Was God when I was suffering?"" This film helps answer doubt with faith when the storms of life assail. ""The Lord is near the brokenhearted; He saves those crushed in spirit."" Psalm 34:18  Thanks and blessings!",1435968000,3,771,4.391608391608392
7062979,5,B00UNEJA22,"This Movie is WONDERFUL, I've never seen such inspiring stories of faith, I was moved to tears, It made me realize that I need to put my everything in Gods hands, I can't begin to express just how much I loved this Movie, Please watch it you won't be sorry.",1435708800,,257,4.16

8707608,5,B00UNEJA22,"I lived through a devastating tornado as a young child that destroyed everything we owned. Neighbors helped neighbors, strangers extended their hands, and support came from out of no where. Each one of the stories in this film resonated very deeply within me. Very well done!",1488067200,,275,5.0
8707609,5,B00UNEJA22,"This was a great movie that reveals Gods goodness in the midst of a horrifying event in the lives of so many. Sometimes we don't understand why things happen but knowing that God is with us no matter the circumstance proves that we can walk through our trial confidently and calmly with Him who gives us strength, Psalm 23. This movie is so touching and inspiring to live and love fearlessly.",1481241600,,392,4.535211267605634

8707614,5,B00UNEJA22,My husband's Aunt and uncle live in Moore and survived that tornado along with their 2 boys. I watched this shortly after it came out before icing through the 12/26/15 tornado that completely took my home away but we climbed out with our family intact. Watching this a 2ND time with a different perspective made this even more emotional. This movie is so raw and real. I'm choking up writing this. Such an amazing way to show families leaning on God and healing. A must watch for everyone.,1458518400,,489,4.568181818181818
