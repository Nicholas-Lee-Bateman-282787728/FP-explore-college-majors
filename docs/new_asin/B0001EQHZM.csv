8011338,5,B0001EQHZM,A joyous concert to watch on the big flatscreen. Would give my eyeteeth to see this in real life. Marc Minkowski is such a delightfully exhuberant conductor. Anne Sofie von Otter is such a performer acting out her singing roles to perfection in such a manner any male would have to fall in love with this gorgeous Swede.,1428019200,,320,4.5344827586206895
8011339,5,B0001EQHZM,"This is a thrilling performance. The music of Offenbach is truly bought out in all its glory by the musicians and choir under the conductor Minkowski.
The singing of Ann Sophie von Otter is superb as are her associate singers.
This is one of the best classical performances I have ever come across.
Highly recommend",1257897600,,315,4.745454545454545
8011340,5,B0001EQHZM,"Anne Sofie von Otter is wonderful in this live performance of selections from Offenbach.  The orchestra, chorus, and supporting singers are wonderful also.  Von Otter interprets so well; it's a joy to watch her relate this music to an audience.  This is a live performance, and not a CD recording, so one shouldn't expect it to be as closely miked.  Von Otter is a first class singer and musician--would love to hear her in person.",1237248000,,431,4.706666666666667
8011341,5,B0001EQHZM,"This is the first encounter of Anne Sofie Von Otter with Offenbach's music. It is highly successful.
Minkowski and his orchestra provide excellent accompaniment. Technical quality, picture and sound, is first class. Enjoy!",1114041600,5,222,5.757575757575758
8011342,2,B0001EQHZM,"It is impossible for me to enjoy this DVD. The singers are simply too far from the microphones. Consequently their voices are echo-y and the words almost impossible to understand even you speak French. Why are some products released like this? I realize Kultur is a small company, but there must be some quality control at some level. Most of their opera DVDs are well recorded; but this is disgraceful. Perhaps my copy is defective, but that is highly unlikely.",1097193600,12,462,4.7875
8011343,5,B0001EQHZM,"What a wonderful DVD. Von Otter and Minkiwsky have a ball here in the ""feel good"" performance of the decade. World news have you feeling bad? Just pop in this DVD and watch a beautiful lady sing beautiful, happy music and forget the worries of the day. The unknown ""Alphabet Song"" may be the funniest ever written.",1086480000,6,314,4.526315789473684
