8650775,3,B00JH1DZ8M,Both of these early Betty White tv shows were cancelled after a year or two so that tells you you something about the quality of these shows. Betty White tries her best but there's not much you can do about terrible scripts and cheap budgets. I'm a retro tv fan but these shows couldn't sustain my interest.,1445472000,,307,4.4035087719298245
8650776,5,B00JH1DZ8M,"This has got to be the best collection for the Betty White fan, and and must have for fans of the golden era of television.

The thing about DVD releases of retro TV shows from yesteryear, is finding a DVD set worthy of the purchase price. There's lots of product out there released on DVD that looks worst than old VHS copies stored in barns. This collection is surprisingly good. They did a great job on the remastering. The visual is crisp and the audio is very good as well. It even looks excellent on a 9' projection screen.

Another thing regarding this collection from Synergy: You get a lot of bang for your buck.  There's 41 episodes and over 17 hours of laughs and memories. Yea... girls love Betty White and she's crossed over to the younger generations as well. Grandmothers, daughters and grand-daughters will love these. Guaranteed! But as a dude I got to tell ya, I got one heck of a kick out of watching these. Just don't tell my football buddies.",1405987200,,963,4.491428571428571
