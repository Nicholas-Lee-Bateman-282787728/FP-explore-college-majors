The reverence, the atmosphere of Holiness shown in this ""Life of Christ"" is nothing short of a Great Miracle of Faith and great accomplishment of cinematography",1504137600,,265,4.911111111111111
8475320,5,B005J0S1XO,"This film about Jesus Christ, for me, is the greatest film ever made regarding the life and death of Jesus. This is an old film, but surpassing every films of the same genre. Not even Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus Christ The Superstar or Ben-Hur can be rated as great as this. The film does not show the face of Jesus, His voice so calm and powerful, yet so Divine and Merciful. It is not as brutal and violent as The Passion depicted it to be so children can watch this without being censored for disturbing scenes. I've watched this film since I was a kid, more than 20 years ago, yearly, until I went to college.

I've watched and tried to compare the all films related to this, and how they tried to portray Jesus and the message behind it, but all of them fell short.

I definitely and highly recommend this Trilogy to everyone and you must see it. I will post a clip in Youtube so everyone can have a glipse before buying it.

Please, please, watch it and share it with others. Thank you.",1269388800,3,1029,4.293814432989691
