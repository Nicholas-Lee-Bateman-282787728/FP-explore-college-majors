331410,4,6301360966,"Wow. Where do I even begin? The state of confusion is so intense, it is hypnotizing. From the moment they begin the movie, till the very end, you constantly ask yourself, ""what the..?"", or ""what is going ON?!!"" This movie is unforgettable. It's so different and so unusual and eccentric, you cannot take your eyes off of it. The main reason I sat through everything was in hopes that the movie will explain itself, or suddenly break back to reality and say, ""ok, that was silly. now let's come to our homeland of the real world."" But no, and that is probably the best thing about this film. I was never so glad I sat through that much confusion in my life. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.",1283731200,5,678,4.346456692913386
331411,5,6301360966,"This was a delightful surprise.  The entire cast is superb, and the ambience is great as it was entirely filmed in an atmospheric English mansion and the surrounding gardens and forests.  If you enjoy culture from the sixties, then this will please you greatly.  And if you also enjoy British dark comedy, you're in for a fantastic treat.  This actually is more of a surreal comedy than a real horror movie, so please don't expect any creepy or heavy vibe.

Vanessa Howard:  I had never heard of her, and there is virtually no information about her online.  She is stunning in this movie.  I was trying to think who she reminded me of, and then it occurred to me:  Sharon Tate, with a British accent.  She obviously is insanely naughty and sinister in this flick.  She is very attractive, and I was pleased to calculate that Ms. Howard was 22 when she played this role even though she is acting like she is younger.  The actor who plays her brother is also brilliant.  The mother admires her two little sweet ""kids,"" even as they lure, torture, and kill dull-witted dupes.  It is all presented in a rather far-fetched comedic fashion, and there is  little gore for the faint of heart.

I rented this off of Netflix, but I certainly will buy it for my ""Sixties Collection.""  It is worthy of certified ""classic"" status, although it apparently has not yet achieved even ""cult"" status.  I think that will change now that it is on DVD.  I give this a ""Must-See"" certification for all lovers of foreign, independent,  obscure, off-beat cinema.  I actually watched it twice, which I can rarely tolerate, and I enjoyed it the second time through even more than the first as there were so many little subtle flourishes which really added to the appeal.",1276300800,11,1743,4.630718954248366
331412,4,6301360966,"Great to see this out on dvd.  Further evidence that England is home to the strangest people in the world.  Behind a facade that's alternately prim-and-proper and cloyingly cute, this family is deeply disturbed.  Fortunately, the family that slays together, stays together.  Until....  There were axes swinging in the sixties, too.",1272585600,13,331,5.411764705882353
331413,5,6301360966,"I remember seeing ""Girly"" durng my Navy experience and found it to be witty and very entertaining. I would encourage anyone who may own the rights to produce this movie in DVD format.",1237161600,12,183,4.575757575757576
331414,5,6301360966,"Fans of British horror and black comedy should definitely track down this Freddie Francis film, which was not imaginatively marketed at the time of its release and was never able to connect with its proper audience. I saw this at the base theatre during my Air Force days. Films on base only ran for only one day (three shows) and this was one of a handful that drew capacity crowds to the second and third shows due to ""word of mouth"" praise by those who attended the first screening.

Originally titled ""Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly"", the title was shortened to just ""Girly"", appropriate since Girly is the main character. It is definitely a product of its times. Imagine mixing ""The Beguiled"" with the television shows ""The Avengers"" and ""The Prisoner"". Francis was primarily a television director.

Like those shows, much of the humor comes from presenting extreme characters and situations as if there they are nothing exceptional. In this case a nutty family of four (insert original title here) which includes a brother and sister far to old for their school uniforms.

Vanessa Howard plays the title character with a lot of sizzle and will remind viewers of Tisha Sterling, especially Sterling's portrayal of Ma Parker's daughter Legs on the Batman television show. She has a lot of fun with this role alternating instantly between playful child, coquettish flirt, and violent psychopath. Howard is a genuinely fine actress, although in ""Girly"" her short skirts and provocative scripting make it hard to concentrate on her acting skills.

This happy family lives on a large estate just outside London and amuse themselves by luring men there to serve as the children's playmates in various games supervised by Mumsy (Ursula Howells) and Nanny (Pat Heywood). When these new friends outlive their usefulness they are dispatched in novel ways and ""sent to the angels"". The last new friend believes himself a murderer and in time actually wants to become part the family, or anything else involving Girly. This sets things up for a cute twist at the end as Francis examines the fragility of sanity.

The best scene is a slick little seduction sequence around the pool table. As the new friend looks on Howard places a doll in each pocket and calmly circles the table, driving a ball into each doll's face. At the same time she keeps up a monologue about the punishment her playmate will receive if he should try to leave. Very cool.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1132876800,,2484,4.846698113207547
7812064,5,6301360966,Yay! It plays well on my laptop. Sound and quality are great.,1523750400,,61,4.166666666666667
7812065,5,6301360966,This is one of my favorite movies ever. Anyone can see how this film could have influenced or set the precedent for the more popular films that came after.  I really wish there was more information and extras associated with this but I know this is the best they could do with an almost lost and forgotten gem.,1493164800,,310,4.344827586206897
7812066,4,6301360966,"Girly is an immature but thoroughly sexed up teenager, she with her brother Sonny, seem to be trapped in a perpetual childhood. They just want to play games, sing nursery rhymes and lure unsuspecting friends back home for frolics, tea cakes and to be sent to meet God early via the angels  bless em the little darlings.

Looking over this idyll of a childhood paradise is the delightful Mumsy who is aided in her maternal duties by a devoted Nanny. The new friends are each given a specific room and are told the rules, which if transgressed have to be dealt with most severely. Some learn the hard way. Then one day  they bring back new friend and he is different to the others, he not only likes games but has a few he wants to play himself  mwaaahh!

Now this is just oodles of fun, Mumsy is about as mad as a box of frogs with the addition of a beehive and an alcoholic bag lady thrown in for good measure. The children are beautifully deranged  operating by a code that only they seem to know and Nanny is something else altogether. This is just mad, bonkers and wonderfully entertaining. It seems dated in places but that adds to the charm; if indeed charm is the right word. If you like a bit of dark comedy with a healthy dose of silliness then I think you may have struck gold with this filmatic gem.",1456963200,,1309,4.322448979591837
7812067,5,6301360966,"This is possibly the most bizarre thing I have ever seen and I love it. It's like if you crossed Shirley Jackson (specifically The Sundial) with Les Enfants Terribles, and added a dash of Baby Jane. I love gothic horror in general, and I have a particular weakness for the dysfunction of insular families and the inward-twisting little worlds they create.  That could be any Faulkner, The House of Yes, Fall of the House of Usher, The Turn of the Screw, Sharp Objects, VC Andrews (real only, not ghostwriter books), The Red House, The Thirteenth Tale, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers even, though that's a slight variation on the theme. From high to low brow, there is a common aesthetic, common thematic elements to all these things, and I've always loved that kind of story. There is something fascinatingly fairy tale like about the decay, eccentricity, and odd, often twisted or stunted sexuality of a family cut off from the rest of the world, and bonus points if they live in a huge old creepy house or castle. This movie has all that and more. It is bananaramapants, combining gothic horror with the campy cultural ethos of 1969 UK and those turn out to be two great tastes that taste great together. The performances are so committed, the actors, especially the divine Vanessa Howard add a level of realism that anchors the film, and keeps it from being just silly.
It's not streaming free anywhere, and though one of Austin's indie video stores has it in stock, I wouldn't count on finding it anywhere if you don't live in a big city with active weird subcultures. So buy it! It's pretty cheap really, cheaper than a non-matinee movie ticket most places, and I've watched it three times so far. It is fascinatingly, beautifully bizarre. It's deranged, but not chaotic or incoherent - in fact it's a well-structured/crafted story with a lot going on under its cheerfully murderous surface. I'm scouring the internet trying to find a copy of the play it was based on, but it's incredibly rare, it seems.",1430352000,,2011,4.72934472934473
7812068,4,6301360966,I have to appreciate this odd little movie.  The plot kept me interested from start to finish.  The characters eccentricities are very well played and maintain your curiosity throughout the movie.,1424390400,,196,5.290322580645161

7812072,5,6301360966,"A nomad meets a strange fatherless family that make the Addams Family look like a Disney film. There is plenty of dastardly things going on in this British film, as the strange clan likes to pretend they are a normal family with the people they kidnap and when something goes wrong, the violence comes out to play. Directed by master Freddie Francis (who directed plenty of Hammer films throughout his career), this film has an edge to it that you don't normally find in films. It's a fun film in an extremely weird sort of way and Scorpion Releasing found a great print for their DVD release. Recommended.",1400371200,,606,4.62037037037037
