8033706,5,B0002W4TDA,"I'm a child of the 1950's, when Twilight Zone and One Step Beyond ruled the airwaves for supernatural shows, at a time when no one talked much of ghosts, esp or other such unearthly things, nor wanted to be known in the unbelievable occurance happening to them. ONLY One Step Beyond was purported to be ""true"" and it called to me, I love it! When I saw it online I HAD to have it, shows that relied mainly on acting to get the story across, not high tech unbelievable stuff to supposedly make it more real...? not... !  I'm getting more of this! Delivery was fast, thank you!",1395532800,,575,4.324074074074074
8033707,2,B0002W4TDA,"I Ordered Season 3 4 5 And There
Are Only 3 Discs With 4 Episodes
On Each Disc, Which is a rip-off
financially speakly plus 3 episodes
are duplicates to season 1 DVD.",1393718400,,166,4.0606060606060606
8033708,5,B0002W4TDA,"I've been looking for certain episodes that I didn't already have for One Step Beyond. This collection had 2  of the 4 it contained I had been searching for, so ordered it. I have watched then and was very pleased with the quality of the DVD's. The price was also excellent. Much lower then I expected even with shipping costs. Great company to do business with for anyone looking for episodes of One Step Beyond.",1365552000,,413,4.506666666666667
8033709,5,B0002W4TDA,"In spite of the not so great video, the stories give one a great sample of the early fifties TV program which were done live and without tape.  I like the whole Lights Out series.",1357344000,,179,4.114285714285714
