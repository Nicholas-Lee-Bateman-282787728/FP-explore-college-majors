1397651,5,B000056JQZ,"Natalie Cole's story, which was based on her best-selling autobiography, comes to vivid life on screen. Like Ms. Cole's book, this movie pulls no punches about the seemingly fairytale life she had as a child to her bouts with drugs, her rise to fame as a singing star, her family life, only for it to all come crashing down due to her addiction--and her amazing comeback due to the one thing she was running away from all her life: acknowledging the legacy of her father, the legendary pop/jazz artist, Nat ""King"" Cole, who had died a tragic death from lung cancer at the age of 45. At the time of his death, Natalie had just turned 15, and has said that his death was something she never got over, but never had the chance to grieve, which  eventually led her to drugs. That, and the need to be daring and experimental. But she explains that it wasn't until the mid-80s when she was in rehab for the second time that she realized this. Bottom line was, she missed her father tremendously.
Diahann Carroll is fantastic as Maria Cole, Natalie's strict disciplinarian mother, and James McDaniel captures the gentle and understanding man that Nat Cole was perfectly, even though his role is not a large one. The two young actresses who play Natalie as a child are enchanting, and Theresa Randle as the young adult Natalie pulls out all the stops for a Emmy-deserving performance.
One of the most touching and true scenes in the movie is when Natalie, playing herself, has to break the news to her young son right before a concert that his father has passed away, then she goes on stage and dedicates her hit song ""Our Love"" to her former husband. The emotion is very real, and you can tell that Natalie was reliving the pain she must've felt then. Also at the very end of the film, you see the actual footage of Natalie singing the smash ""Unforgettable"" with Nat on video at the 1992 Grammy awards. Another heart-touching moment. It also shows the ups and downs of the music industry and how certain situations are handled and overcome. A phenomenal story. Highly recommended! Now if only we can bring Nat's story to the screen....",978825600,24,2128,4.6
1397652,5,B000056JQZ,"I SAW THIS MOVIE ON TV AND IT WAS FANTASTIC.  IT SHOWS HOW SHE USED DRUGS AND HOW IT AFFECTED HER LIFE AND CAREER.  IT SHOWS HOW SHE WAS NOT CLOSE TO HER MOTHER.  HER MOTHER DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE A SINGER.  UP UNTIL THE LAST 30 MINUTES OR SO, THE ACTUAL NATALIE COLE TAKES OVER AS HERSELF.  THE MOVIE ENDS WITH NATALIE RECORDING A DUET WITH NAT ""KING"" COLE AND HER PERFORMING ON THE GRAMMYS.  ALL TOGETHER: FANTASTIC",977961600,14,416,4.1375
1397653,4,B000056JQZ,"The actress that played Natalie in her younger years, did a good job acting. I wished that it was on a dvd instead of a VHS, but it's better than nothing. I first saw this movie on television. It's a shame that we sometimes fill the void in our lives with something that will kill us slowly, but quickly as well. We get a chance, and we give it back to the world, to the devil. Shame!",1384819200,2,384,4.0
1397654,5,B000056JQZ,I like the fact that this is a true story.  It really hits close to home because I have a family who went through the similar struggles with addiction.,1377302400,4,151,4.206896551724138
1397655,5,B000056JQZ,I remember this movie when it was on Lifetime.  What I remembered was that the amazing Theresa Randle played Natalie Cole.  I was never able to see the entire movie and the bits and pieces I saw are almost out of my memory.  This movie was purchased for a friend and maybe one day she'll invite me over to watch it.  I could go for that and some nacho's.  You hear me friend?,1371859200,,375,4.082191780821918

1397657,5,B000056JQZ,"This is a great Awesome movie of one of my all time favorite artist, ever since I was 9 years old. I really hope that this is one that is released on DVD in the future. If ever released on DVD or Bluray I will be the first in line to purchase it! A must have of a true artist that can truly sing! This movie made me feel so mush closer to her as a fan. So, really hopeful for that DVD Bluray release!",1320624000,,400,3.7176470588235295
1397658,3,B000056JQZ,"Enjoyed the Natalie Cole movie for the first time on BET channel. I am a collector of biography videos, but I look DVD format only. The movie itself was very good and well portrayed. VHS is outdated and don't want to buy VHS version. If it were sold in DVD, I would have purchased it immediately. Otherwise, very good bio of Natalie Cole. Just not in VHS format desired.",1300060800,2,370,4.3768115942028984

1397660,5,B000056JQZ,This movie is a true gem. I bought it at the thrift store for 50 cents. What a steal. It goes to show that you can have it all and still throw it away. Natalie didn't won't to live in her father's shawdow are be known as Nat King Coles daughter. But thats who she is. And that's nothing wrong with that. I love to hear him sing the christmas song. Because it feels like christmas is almost here. The movie was truly unforgettable and so was the price I paid to buy it.,1287705600,2,468,3.9893617021276597
1397661,5,B000056JQZ,"This product should be put on dvd.  I was so touched by Natalies testimony and her honesty that christians can make mistakes...and still come out on top with the help of the Lord. Very moving, loving and worthy of praise.  A must to view",1287273600,,237,4.363636363636363
1397662,5,B000056JQZ,"This movie really touched my heart.  The Cole family lacked communication skills in connecting with each other.  Natalie Cole used drugs to num her pain.  Also, Natalie Cole and her ex-husband truly loved each other, but the drugs ruined thier marriage, because they were not in their right mind.  This is a lesson on how people who claim love for one another, that take it for granted, and wish they could turn the clock back.  The Natalie Cole story is highly recommed by me.",1215993600,9,477,4.630952380952381

7932070,4,B000056JQZ,"This movie i really enjoyed, it was good to see how things took place in Natalie Coles life when she was younger.  Most of the time when you know the back ground of a singer or star actor, actress it give you a feel of what the person has gone thru and when things bad happen to can understand why.  A lot of times we as people think that they are super stars with no floss but not true, i would say yes please buy this movie you will enjoy.",1388016000,2,441,3.888888888888889
