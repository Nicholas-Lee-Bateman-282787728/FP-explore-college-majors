3090059,3,B0012IX36M,"I was able to watch the movie in one sitting, but it wasn't a good quality film, it was low budget and it looked more like someone filmed it with their home video instead of a motion picture camera.

The story line was okay, I can't say I would recommend anyone to buy this movie. I would say rent it or bowrrow it from a friend who has it.",1214438400,4,340,3.927536231884058

3090061,2,B0012IX36M,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased a copy of this movie.  It was drawn out- too many characters and not enough information regarding all the issues that surfaced. Acting was unrealistic at times and its ending was unexpected- actually not making too much sense.

If you have nothing else to do and want to buy a very cheap copy of this movie, then it is probably worth it.  However, if you want to watch a good movie- this is not the one to rent or buy.",1212624000,2,464,4.191011235955056
3090062,4,B0012IX36M,"I went into this movie expecting something like Soul Food meets Ma Dear's Family Reunion, but what I found instead was a story about a family that centers on its matriarch, who is not domineering but loving, a father who is wise but strong and siblings who seem to function more as friends or neighbors than as a close-knit unit. Then there is Robert and his up-and-down/on-again off-again love-hate relationship with his wife. There are some editing issues and I question the film's ending. Overall, some very different editing choices would have highlighted the talents of the experienced actors more and would have made this a much more compelling story. It is a good conversation starter for families dealing with a series of complex issues, where ""just pray about it"" is not the only answer. A movie the entire family can enjoy together.",1205107200,5,842,4.895104895104895
3090103,1,B0012IX36M,"You know how you rent/buy/download/stream a movie knowing it is probably low budget and bootleg in quality - you do this in hopes that the movie is so bad that it is actually good (in a B-movie kind of way).  Well this movie is so bad that it is actually bad.  Scratch that, it is so bad that it is downright embarrassing.  When you watch this debacle you will be amazed at the overall lack of any redeeming cinematic qualities.  The acting is atrocious, the plot is non-existent, and the production is rudimentary at best.  In short, if you made a movie with your cell phone it would be a cinematic masterpiece compared to this sad excuse for a movie.  Believe it or not this was the kindest review I could come up with.  Don't take my word, watch it for yourself and see if you have any love for this street corner/back alley production.",1327968000,3,839,4.374193548387097

This movie certainly changed that.  I have never seen such a horrible movie.  All of the previous reviews are accurate descriptions of the horrendous nature of this movie.  I purchased this movie so that my family and I can continue in our tradition of watching holiday movies with a black cast.  I was so embarrassed.  My parents and sister kept asking me what in devil did I have them watching.  After 15 mins, my family began commentary about the movie.  The commentary was WAY better than the movie.  I guess the movie did work to give my family and I some laughs, but we could have found laughs without me wasting my money.

3090108,1,B0012IX36M,"This movie was absolutely, positively one of the worse movies I have ever seen.
 1-the characters in the movie do not match with the picture on the cover of the DVD.
 2-The storyline is poorly written and inconsistent.
 3-The vidotaping jumps around -indicative of low-budget.
 4-The characters do not have much depth at all.  The father? or perhaps he is the step-father-well the actor who plays him does not seem to be in the cover picture photo.
 5-The storyline seems abstract.  The viewer has to guess much of what is not spoken.  They should have given a written background information.
It seems like the movie is a second-part or continuation of another storyline...as if the first part of the story is missing. I totally missed the reading the reviews before buying this poor attempt.

8246111,1,B0012IX36M,"Some important things to note in this movie once you get past the horrible audio, sound and framing.

The people in the cover are not in the movie.
Three generations of Black people somehow all look around the same age.
There is no Christmas dinner and they eat dessert first in this house (before dinner).
When drinking wine, do not let it touch your lips.
They leave the dinner table in the middle of the day and go to sleep.
One of the family members is a vampire and sleeps standing up and facing a corner.
Its summer time, do not go outside and smoke a joint, do it in a small bathroom with the windows closed.
Do not buy your car oil from local Arabs who make their own, it messes the car up and you will somehow then need gas to get it going again.
We can close the movie in three minutes with a multi group, two person short discussion using ""can we talk for a minute""...fad to black.  The movie chooses smartly to just stop and not come to a conclusion or resolution.",1509926400,2,976,4.213903743315508
