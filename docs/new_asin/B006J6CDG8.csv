4992634,5,B006J6CDG8,"I saw this scheduled on my PBS channel and tuned in expecting a Ken Burns documentary.  I was interested in the subject matter because I had heard of the Yiddish Theater serving as the precursor for much of Broadway and movies, and of the Tomashefsky's in particular (including the famous enema joke when Boris died) but had no first hand experience.  I was delightfully surprised and blown away that not only was there archival footage, but grandson Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the New World Orchestra, and great young singing actors portraying the parts.  Contrary to another reviewer, I think Judy Blazer, who plays Bessie is absolutely outstanding.  She has that magic spark in abundance.  And when I found out that she's now 55 years old, I was blown away again.  She looks like she's 30.  So get a hold of this production already, and klive nachas!",1333238400,4,859,4.842465753424658
4992635,4,B006J6CDG8,"Unless you are Jewish, you will probably know little of Jewish theatre other than the fact that it deeply influenced the birth of Broadway...yet it was an essential part of Yiddish culture in the urban enclaves of America and Eastern Europe at the turn of the century.  Michael Tilson Thomas obviously 'adores"" his grandparents who were stars of the stage and lovingly recreates their romance and their world in this program of Great Performances.

It is charming...it is informative...it is entertaining.  But I can't quite give it 5 stars because the two performers whom he selected to play his grandparents just don't have ""that"" special something that make performances mesmerizing.  Actually, the deep, melodic voice of Boris Thomashefsky can be heard in the CD ""Memories of Yiddish Theater.""  And for more great music of this genre, pick anything with Molly Picon, try the CD of ""Bruce Adler An Evening at the Yiddish Theatre"", or get the marvelous CD of ""Theodore Bikel Treasury of Yiddish  Theatre & Folk Songs"".

Jewish theater is a fascinating subject.  My favorite books on the topic are ""Chagall and the Artists of the Russian Jewish Theater"" [which depicts the extraordinary attention to the staging of these plays - including Shakespeare in Yiddish] and the autobiography of the stage star Herman Yablokoff titled ""Der Payatz"".  One thing is certain, Boris Thomashefsky  and his Yiddish Theatrical Alliance bought a large graveplot so that all the New York Yiddish theatre greats could rest in peace...together.",1333238400,8,1525,5.162601626016261
4992636,5,B006J6CDG8,"I enjoyed this folkloric telling of Michael Tilson Thomas's grandparents.  In his intro, MTT talks of all the different sources that were used to put this story together and I love the parts he would tell us was from the family at dinners or in daily life events. The setting is equally intimate - two large chairs, a rug and side tables with a lamp for each of them (one for each grandparent), MTT's use of actual photos of the time (shades of Ken Burns and a slide show) with MTT talking to us (because the intimacy has moved us away from audience to guests hearing a family story) about what happened next to whom.

Now the music - the history of the Yiddish theatre and hearing the music -as a lover of musicals, operettas, some opera and classical (as well as other music), I could hear and see what influences are in the genre today.  As I listen to the music, I could hear elements of Jerry Herman, Gershwin's use of solo instruments giving the feeling of being alone and individual before the crowd of instruments pour into the music, and Fiddler on the Roof even Hello Dolly! had an aura that reminded me of MTT's grandmother.  Of course Yentil, Funny Girl and Funny Lady and elements of Albert Nodds are stories his grandmother was a part of first with the help of his grandfather producing and often writing her in.

Even politically hearing her song of a woman president and women's rights was a joy and these lyrics are a strong reminder for me in this political year of 2012.

MTT has invited all of us to this - please as you get your invite, drop by and bring the leftovers home or in this case get the DVD and enjoy it again and again.",1333152000,9,1652,4.364820846905538
4992637,4,B006J6CDG8,I loved it when it first was on PBS.  Loved it on DVD.  My only complaint is that subtitles would have been nice.,1389571200,,113,3.869565217391304

4992640,5,B006J6CDG8,"A loving and incredibly entertaining tribute by Thomas to his legendary grandparents. The outstanding cast of Broadway and grand opera stars -- and of course the full orchestra -- give a rare opportunity to hear how wonderful this music was when originally performed. Anyone with a passion for musicals will enjoy this, and it is a must have for anyone with an interest in Jewish cultural history.",1374105600,,397,4.940298507462686

4992642,5,B006J6CDG8,"MTilsonThomas delivers a very personal memoir of his grandmother, and a historical review of his grandfather's life as he traces their lives through Yiddish Theater.  The tempo of the dialogue, music and movement is familiar to those of us who grew up loving these sounds!  MTThomas is a gifted conductor of very gifted musicians.",1370649600,,330,5.092592592592593

4992644,4,B006J6CDG8,"Having been a student and 'tea time friend' of Miss Stella Adler in the early 1980's, I fear that she may now be turning over in her grave...perhaps just once or twice?....over this mildly self indulgent depiction of the Thomashefskys as the God and Goddess of the Yiddish theater. Now, having said that, the piece is also very educational, both to theatergoers and those interested in the history of America. So I feel its an important show. However, first and foremost, I must applaud Mr. Tilson Thomas on his casting Judy Blazer as Bessie. Blazer has a very solid record of decades of Broadway theater and yet very little has been preserved in video. Up until NOW, that is! Blazer is, in a nutshell, what musical theater is all about and if you buy this video for no other reason than experiencing her performance, you have spent every last penny EXTREMELY wisely.",1363824000,3,867,4.7105263157894735
4992645,5,B006J6CDG8,"I mentioned this to my daughter's mother-in-law and she immediately started to tell me all about it - as a child, her parents had gone to the theatre and she knew all about this family.  I ordered a copy for her and a copy for me.  Now her memories are ""shared memories"" we can both enjoy.",1352160000,,289,4.142857142857143
