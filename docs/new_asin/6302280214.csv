7824706,4,6302280214,"I have been a big fan of Brian Aherne and his films for a long time.  He is the primary reason I got this film and really carries this one.  It is a comedy/drama with the Ford/Hayworth combination the young lovers who take a back seat to Aherne's lead.  The story is cute, but a little choppy at times but has a bunch of nice little performances.  It relies more on the sentiment than details and is generally light hearted.  Any fan of the leads will probably enjoy the film as I did, but it is clearly an Aherne vehicle.  You also have a young Evelyn Keyes in the cast who would go on to bigger roles most notably in Here Comes Mr. Jordan.  This is by no means a classic and supposedly is based on a classic french play, but it is an enjoyable short film.",1444867200,2,757,4.108843537414966

7824708,5,6302280214,"I think the reason I like this so much is because it is one of her 1st movies and her 1st pairing with Glenn Ford and while they did seem a little awkward together it was still very,very good",1390953600,2,191,3.923076923076923
7824709,5,6302280214,"A charming, cute movie, the first to pair Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, directed by Charles Vidor. Brian Aherne is funny and touching as Andre Morestan, the family man who finds himself a jury member on the case of young Natalie Roguin (Hayworth) accused of murdering her lover. After she is acquitted, Andre takes pity on the poor girl and gives her a job in his bicycle shop, as well as providing room and board, but concealing her true identity from his family. His son, Pierre (Ford), however, knows who she is as he stole into the courthouse one day during the trial. His obvious attraction to her is sweetly presented, with his clattering case of butterfingers. Only when he begins to suspect that she is having an affair with his father, does he reveal that he knows her true identity. After the misunderstanding is cleared up, the young duo fall in love, but Andre's opposition, as well as Natalie's fear of her true identity being revealed, puts a strain on the situation. Things change for the worse when the ne'er do well fianc?e, Robert (Edward Norris) of Pierre's sister Francoise (Evelyn Keyes, best remembered as Scarlett's whiny sister Suellen in GWTW), makes advances toward Natalie when he discovers the truth. Then Natalie's innocence comes into question in Andre's mind, until he learns that there is new evidence that Natalie indeed acted in self-defense. A happy little ending wraps up about an hour and a half of this interesting little gem. Irene Rich is great as Michele Morestan, wife and mother, who provides warmth and wisdom.

The chemistry that Hayworth and Ford would go on to display in four more films is very apparent here; their scenes together are adorable, boil over with chemistry, and it is little wonder that they went on to become one of the great romantic screen couples, as well as stars in their own right. And Aherne regarded this as one of his favorite films - and it's easy to see why!

Needs to be on DVD.",1146096000,12,1953,4.707602339181286
