7932644,5,B000056NWY,"Wonderful characters, outstanding special effects, great plots and superb voice actors are just a few reasons to own this set of six great DVD's.

The story follows the adventures of the inhabitants of warring worlds that must come together to battle a common foe set on destroying them all. Honor, sacrifice and co-operation are regular themes of the series intermingled with deceit and deception.

Myself and my 7 year-old daughter really enjoy the action-packed episodes and the great character development. I have a state-of-the-art HD home theater set-up and these disks translate wonderfully to the big screen. The excellent sound quality is the icing on the cake.

Obviously, I give this series my highest recommendation.",1360368000,,728,5.3130434782608695
7932645,5,B000056NWY,I loved this series.  Anyone who was a fan of the Reboot series by Mainframe (before the got bought out) will love this cartoon.  It has the same funny dialogue and animation that was revolutionary and before-its time in the 90's.,1269648000,,230,4.585365853658536
7932646,5,B000056NWY,"War Planets Shadow Raiders was developed in 1998-9 , and the computer animation for it's time was cutting edge ! This magnificent series was not only ahead of it's time for the computer technology used , but it also has a magnificent story line and imagination to spare ! This series explores the psychology of teamwork , and at the same time shows the futility of constant warfare amongst those who must join forces to survive a common threat . Although based loosely on a Toy line which came out before it , this series rises above and beyond the imagination used to create the toys. If given a chance this series will find it's way into and amongst the best of your science fiction collection, or your animated collection, it fits nicely into both . It's amazing, and beyond the definitions of either genre . A five star rating all the way.",1265760000,,843,4.516339869281046
7932647,5,B000056NWY,The Shadow Raiders saga still holds a high standard in CGI. Not quite as good as Final Fanatsy (a grossly unfair comparison) but still very good nonetheless.  A series well worth owning.,1059350400,,186,4.8125
7932648,4,B000056NWY,"Excellent CGI animation, decent soundtrack and good plot make this a nice peice to have to anyones anime/animation collection. As stated the plot is good but not unique. In fact you could compare the concept to Babylon 5, an excellent show in its own right. Alien worlds must put aside their conflicts and distrust with each other to overcome a cosmic evil threat.
In all, Mainframe does an excellent job adding to an impressive lineup of CGI shows including the poular 'Reboot', 'Beast Wars', and 'Action Man'.",997228800,2,511,4.885057471264368
