8071124,5,B000A0D1SI,"I don't think anyone has any idea how stressful it can be to be a member of the Royal Family,  From the time you are born to the time you die, everything you do or say is plastered all over the television and the newspapers.  You never have a moment for yourself.  It is very much like living in a prison, althouh a very nice prison.",1374883200,,333,4.015151515151516
8071125,3,B000A0D1SI,"You would think this spoke about the brothers equally.  However, this is 95% about William and 5% about Harry.  Sometimes it's very critical of Harry, but it's almost always gushy about William.  Yes, it's William that is killer hot, but why throw salt on a wound?  I'm sure Harry doesn't want the second-rate coverage.  This work answers a lot of questions, but it is also quite gushy.  It could be monarchist propaganda because its message is, ""William is so wonderful in looks, height, behavior, and taste in women.  So be excited that he'll be King one day!""  I am an African-American male and when they showed William DJ'ing for a radio show and he said, ""Big ups to so-and-so!"", I almost fell out of my chair.  You know the world must love them some African-American slang when even British royalty are using it.",1200268800,2,818,4.664335664335664
