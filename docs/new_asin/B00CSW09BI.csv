8585890,4,B00CSW09BI,"I didn't expect much and that always helps. I've come to wonder if positive reviews for these types of movies isn't a disservice, even if a necessary one. The synopsis is pretty vague, which is also good. You get the gist as the movie unrolls: there's a gathering at a mentally disturbed girl's house. Things start getting ugly quick. The lead actress is very effective in this role. She looks and acts like what you'd expect someone in her predicament to be like. We aren't talking about ordinary mental illness here but someone who seems to be afflicted by a malevolent force, if not a demonic haunting (in an atmospheric sense, not that we will see any forces or demons). The horror visuals are good, creepy and atmospheric. Good production values overall.

That being said, I'd have liked it better if the ending had continued the main (supernatural) storyline. I'll be vague so as not to spoil it.",1396396800,,902,4.708860759493671

8585892,4,B00CSW09BI,"I was pleasantly surprised with this film and the ending will catch you off guard altogether which pays off.  I'm a fan of horror films, but being an Indie film I wasn't aware of this particular film.  The reason I bought it was because the actor who plays the voice of Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 6 did an interview on YouTube and mentioned that he was in the film.  Based on that interview, I took a chance to purchase it (being that the actor is an amazing voice actor) and was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed the film.  Glad I took the chance to purchase it and glad that Amazon not only offers the typical ""blockbuster"" films ...but also carries Indie film gems like Evil Inside.",1392854400,,693,4.390625
8585893,5,B00CSW09BI,"I personally LOVED this. It's got tons of drama, which is rare for a slasher.  I found the mix between the slasher and ghost story elements really unique.
I did some digging on this film, which was originally titled ""Dead Inside."" Check out all the awards:

8585894,1,B00CSW09BI,"The Evil Inside was tedious, a problem aggravated by an abundance of really odd choices in shots -- why are faces hidden at every opportunity?? Makes an already boring movie that much harder to watch. For the first half of the movie in place of story we're treated to absurdly long lingering shots of our main character Sarah doing moody teenager things. She sits and stares at things in a box. She slowly makes tea and stares around the kitchen. She sits on the stairs in the dark for a few minutes of screen time.

When we're not being enthralled by that, we are being introduced to other characters, although ""introduced"" doesn't quite describe hearing the characters voices but seeing the backs of their heads through bushes.

Fortunately, the pace does pick up once everyone gets together, and we finally get to see some faces. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean the flimsy story improves, or that Sarah steps up much from moody teenager to terrifying main event. There's a few hesitant steps in the right direction, but the film still falls flat.

The ending was, surprisingly enough, appropriately foreshadowed. It was satisfying enough, but didn't have a wild, skin-crawling horror impact.

The best I can say is that it still managed to push out a few creepy moments in between overly drawn out scenes(fast forwarded 5 times to get through the whole thing). With even marginally better direction, this could have been a tolerable, sloppy low budget horror guilty pleasure. As it is, The Evil Inside is a chore to watch, so don't.",1372896000,4,1536,4.851145038167939
8585895,2,B00CSW09BI,"Sarah (Hannah Ward) is a disturbed person who has premonitions and ""episodes."" She makes Carrie look like a social butterfly. We don't know the exact nature of her reclusive problem, but we do know her parents moved due to her being tormented. The parents must leave and have Lucy (Sage Howard) come over and keep her company. Lucy, invites her friends and they decide to make it a party.

Things turn weird at about 30 minutes into the film with the kids being locked inside the house (with windows). The horror aspect at this point wasn't too bad. When it came time to bring the film home, they came with a twist, one that filled in plot continuity gaps. The problem I had was that the twist lessened the film. They twisted the wrong way.

This is slightly less than a meh rental.
