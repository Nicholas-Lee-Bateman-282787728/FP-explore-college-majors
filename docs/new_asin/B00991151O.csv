5277538,3,B00991151O,. Acting not bad. Would not recommend it. Scenery was good. The action was a little slow moving. Looked at it because a great nephew was in it.,1359590400,,143,4.142857142857143
5277539,4,B00991151O,"It is not a hard and fast grubby western that men usually like but has enough for men and women to enjoy it together!  Good story line.  I think most who like westerns, will like this movie so recommend to them.",1359504000,4,211,4.121951219512195
5277540,3,B00991151O,"Dodge City this ain't!  Filmed in Alberta, Canada, this gorgeously backdropped film forces us to leave reality and history at the door and wait for the big time shoot-out finale.

Sara Canning(""The Vampire Diaries"") plays a woman turned bounty hunter out to revenge the killing of her family- seen at the beginning of the movie.  Like ""Quick and the Dead"" with Sharon Stone, one has to accept that this young, lithe woman can match up with the toughest of the hombres.  She goes to Dodge, meets and romances Wyatt Earp, Grayston Holt(""Lost Boys""), and Doc Holliday(Ryan Kennedy- who plays it sounding very much like Val Kilmer in ""Tombstone"").

Danny Glover(Hey, where's Mel?), Kimberly Elise(toting a shotgun), and Billy Zane help out as suporting cast.  It's kind of a fantasy played for real in an alternative universe. And it's fine overall to kill, so to speak, an hour and a half.

Not rated: there's a lot of dialogue, controlled western violence, limited language, and no significant nudity or sex(PG-13?).  It's more about relationships, characterizations and angst.",1355011200,8,1075,5.102857142857143
5277541,5,B00991151O,Watch many tv movies and this is one I am happy to find come out on DVD.  Had to find this by actress name and wasn't in the usual dvd listings.,1355011200,2,144,3.6451612903225805
5277543,4,B00991151O,"This is a Western made with a young female audience in mind. Perhaps that's why it never really had much success since Westerns are generally seen as an old man's genre by the younger demographic and not something most female teens would even consider.  It's not realistic at all, and like a Saturday Morning TV show, it is family friendly images, including when people die.  People basically just fall over backwards, sometimes with someone else screaming no and running and kneeling beside them.  Of course our main young hero doesn't like killing outlaws, she's a bounty hunter and chooses the alive part of the Dead or Alive wanted poster option every time.  We don't really see how she managed to tie up or get onto their horse larger older prepared to kill who would fight until the end since they know they're going to be hung, bad guys, this is the standard shoot them in the arm so they drop their gun and then the next scene you see her riding her horse with him on another tied up behind being brought into town way of telling a tale.

Hannah is basically what she is as a gang of outlaws rode and murdered her family while she was playing hide and seek in the barn when she was a little girl.  Now old enough to do something about it and having been raised by Danny Glover who was a bounty hunter, she has been successfully apprehending those in the pose one by one.  This is the sort of family aimed movie where things like racial discrimination of the times aren't really acknowledged (except where Glover mentions he won't get a trial at one stage) but you've got another female teen character, Hannah's best friend who is dark skinned, who drinks at the saloon bar, who moves around the hotel Hannah lives in and the town freely with no hinderances, discrimination or racist comments by townsfolk. With Glover you're kind of waiting for him to say his classic Lethal Weapons series ""I'm getting to old for this ...."" line, and he almost does but keeps it short and clean.

Hannah's Law isn't going to do much for your hard core Western crowd, but if you like your lighter Westerns like Young Guns, Back to the Future III, and those sort of heavily using artistic licence type films that are having fun more so than telling a serious story, you will probably enjoy this one.  It does have Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and other historic characters, but again they're just having fun with them and not there for historic buffs to find much authenticity with.",1447632000,,2468,4.553047404063205
5277544,4,B00991151O,"This was a good western, not the best, but I didn't think it was a waste of money. It gave me something to watch on a Sunday afternoon. It was about a girl who turned grew up to be a bounty hunter because some bad guys killed her family. I did not see the purpose of throwing Wyatt
Earp, Doc Holiday and a few other historical characters into the mix. They could have had fictional names and it would have been just as
good. There is a bit of romance between Wyatt and Hannah and Hannah and Doc but nothing that would make give it an R rating. I actually
found the character of Doc Holiday very charismatic and would have loved to see that romance develop, Wyatt was too straight laced for my
taste. At any rate, I did not feel it was a waste of money and I will watch again.",1445126400,3,775,4.071895424836601

5277563,1,B00991151O,"Potential not lived up to.  Not even close.
Better written than acted, though it could be how the lead was directed.
Regardless, an ice-cold performance that did not change an iota, even
when the script required at least one new emotion from her.  Sad, as
the character as written had promise, along with the lesser leads, some
playing old-west names with which we're all familiar.
Do save your money for something entirely more satisfying (pretty
much anything will do!)",1400716800,,471,4.949367088607595

Hannah just pulls at your heartstrings as well as provides you with a strong character who will accomplish her purpose no matter what or who gets in her way. She is beautiful and enduring and is an excellent actress, perfect for the part and fascinating to the last scene. There are so many opportunities provided in this movie for a sequel for which I am hoping and praying! This movie does not disappoint and provides a laugh or two along with it's very serious moments. A cast of strong characters played by equally strong character actors who they represent! More! More!",1365206400,2,633,4.711711711711712
