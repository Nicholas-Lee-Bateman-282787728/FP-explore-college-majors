8542315,5,B009JVZEB6,"Yes, I was able to view many of these shows ""first hand"" in the 1950's and I can tell you now that after viewing them again...HOW I MISS THE ""GOLDEN AGE OF TV""!  Stories relied on great writing and superb acting by many actors who were stage performers long before TV made its first appearance.  True the ""quality"" isn't HD...but who cares?  I'm thrilled to see them again and so glad these tapes have survived over 50 years!  My only hope is that ""more tapes"" may come to surface so that I can continue to purchase them and get a ""welcome relief"" from the dismal current TV fare being offered today.  Maybe today's ""young producers"" will finally catch on and realize that we don't want to be constantly ""hit over the head"" with banal scripts and gratuitous nudity and violence.  Learn from these past artisans and create some ""quality shows"" for today's audiences.",1400457600,3,865,4.620915032679738
8542316,5,B009JVZEB6,"This is how 1950 TV was with a little bit of remastering.  I really enjoyed the 4 plays for the same reason that the other reviewer did not like them--1950's TV was simple, basic and primitive compared to today.  But I bought this to experience the beginnings of television.  With remastering, the black and white programming is crisp and the sound is mostly good.  Also, don't expect any elaborate special effects, cursing, sex, or fancy sets.  Here's a synopsis:

The Comedian--A vaudeville comic has his own TV show and he is a vile, hateful person to his staff and especially to his brother who is his assistant.  I never cared for Mickey Rooney until this drama--he plays the comic and is extraordinary.  Mel Torme plays the abused brother with pathos and is excellent.  Watch out for the now obsolete station identification and the cigarette commercials.

Charley's Aunt--A British comedy starring Art Carney who impersonates Charley's aunt so that Charley and his friend Jack will have a proper escort  for their 2 girlfriends.  This play was written in the 1890's and is hilarious.  You can imagine the results with Art Carney dressed as an elderly woman.  He is brilliant.  The future novelist Tom Tryon plays Charley in one of his earliest roles.  The British accents are sometimes terrible, but this is my favorite of the 4 plays.

Bomber's Moon--Written by Rod Serling, this is a story of a military officer who goes into battle to win, and cares nothing about the many men he loses.  A powerful drama anti-war drama.

No Time At All--One of the very few filmed Playhouse 90 shows--most were live.  An airliner loaded with passengers becomes dark due to electrical failure.  The weather has turned ugly.  We never see the plane, crew or passengers in flight, only the reactions of family, friends and crew on the ground.  Mesmerizing.",1389916800,8,1846,4.864951768488746
