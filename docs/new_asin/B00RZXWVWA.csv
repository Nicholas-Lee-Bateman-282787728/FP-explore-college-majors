8696621,1,B00RZXWVWA,"This should be illegal, misrepresented enough to make it sound like it's a new DVD of a live performance of Ray Price.  It is the first half of a concert done in 1984 at Doc Severinsen's in OK.  There is only one complete performance of this concert and it's called Ray Price Live In Concert which is extremely rare.  Now who ever produced this one, knew this was from that concert and has purposely misrepresented it.  Here's what it says in the description on Amazon ""Country music's Ray Price delivers a 60-minute collection of honky-tonk rarities including Spanish Eyes, Burning Memories, For The Good Times and more. Filmed between 1954 and 1956.""  Believe me there are no Honky Tonk songs on this DVD.  Now who ever produced this DVD can quite easily see it's not from the 50's but instead the 80's.  This same DVD has been sold under two other titles ""Ray Price Cherokee Cowboy"" and ""Ray Price: Live at the Renaissance Center"", only difference with this one is they cut out the introduction from what I can tell.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  Oh it's a good concert even if it's only half of the complete concert but you can go buy one of the other two I mentioned and probably get it cheaper.  This is very frustrating that this kind of stuff goes on, it should be illegal.  I probably wouldn't have bought it except for the description stating it was filmed between 1954 and 1956.",1426291200,3,1378,4.516129032258065
8696622,4,B00RZXWVWA,"This review is based on an advance copy that I received from the distributor.

This is another ""undated"" performance video from LaserMedia but it certainly will appeal to fans of country music legend Ray Price (who died in 2013 at age 87). No, it's not perfect but Price was in fine voice in this concert (apparently the second of two sets) in Oklahoma City, OK. It's not dated - and the Amazon description says 1950sm but that's too early - but some research shows he did tour with his Cherokee Cowboys to Oklahoma City in 1961-63 and - based on the wide lapels - I'm guessing that this was when it was recorded.
The sound is pretty darn good - and there's not a lot of footage of Price out there - and the image is decent too. The color does strange things because of the lighting and, at times, his skin tones may have a greenish tint. The band behind him (which has FOUR fiddles among the 8 players) looks really young. Price introduces them by name and none were familiar to me.  He performs his hits as well as two Willie Nelson- penned songs (""Crazy"" and ""Night Life""). Price has the easy style of George Strait.

The concert lasts 36 minutes and includes 12 songs, The 13th one listed ""For The Good Times (Instrumental)"" is just the 1 minute background by the band as Price takes his bows.

The image is the standard 1:33/1 screen aspect ratio.

Obviously this is not an ""authorized"" recording - and a pretty thorough search on Google - did not bring up the source., But for Price fans this one is worth a look.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
