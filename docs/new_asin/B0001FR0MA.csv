1995800,5,B0001FR0MA,"Since I am such a common man, I can be forgiven, I think, for giving this performance a five star rating, while the experts give it quite poor ratings. Maybe it is good to be common (same as average) because I can get a lot of enjoyment from performances which ""others"" think are less than perfect. This is my favorite ballet danced by Letestu. Better than the POB version of Swan Lake, for instance, which was marred by poor camera ""work"", as well as a bad libretto. True, Letestu may not have as good stage presence as some ballerinas, I think she is a good ballerina and her characterization as an Etoile certainly does not rankle me as it does others. If I had any complaint on Letestu it might be her air of smugness which to me seems to say, ""Oh, I am so good."" (PS.....I have to retract that statement, because ""La Dame aux Camelias"" is now my favorite ballet starring Letestu, and she does not exhibit that air of smugness, I refered to before.)

So what, if this version of Paquita is slightly different from what Petipa staged in eighteen hundred and who knows when? There should be a little variation in style, since dance itself has changed in the past hundred and fifty years. No one seems to complain when Nureyev makes changes in choreography and libretto (Swan Lake and La Baradere for instance). The changes he made in the National Ballet of Canada version of Sleeping Beauty w/himself and Veronica Tennant, for instance, were atrocious.

This ballet is presented in the 16-9 video format, has several good sound formats, and has beautiful sets, lighting, and colorful costuming. It is 109 minutes in duration with 12 minutes bonus material. Letestu even makes one costume change on set. Well done, but don't get excited, you won't see any of her ""bod"".

I liked this ballet, and if you're common like me you probably will too.....Richard.",1246147200,7,1856,4.652439024390244
1995801,1,B0001FR0MA,"I thought this performance was bad. The dancers were not so good, and kind of boring.  The exception is that it is the only full length Paquita around.  However, most companies do Paquita as something quite different than this one, such as in the movie Kirov Classics.",1240444800,,268,4.680851063829787
1995802,3,B0001FR0MA,"A must-see ballet for the dancer (Martinez is splendid, as always). For aspiring ballerinas: watch for what NOT to do!
This video was an educational and unforgettable experience for me--it shocked me into attention how important the arms and upper body are.  In order to look good on stage, I now understand that I must do exactly the opposite of Letestu.  And as it was obviously black/white, Letestu was completely devoid of feelings/emotion/personality. So the lesson here is to dance FOR THE AUDIENCE, giving your all.  Besides dancing, one must know how to walk onto  stage or run to another spot like a ballerina: no shuffling! The good thing I will take away from Letestu's performance is the acting; I will try to use some of her pantomiming skills.",1229817600,3,757,4.844961240310077

1995805,5,B0001FR0MA,"I'm not a ""ballet historian"" like the other reviewer, but I'm a dancer and as much a balletomane as any, and for what it's worth, I think the DVD is delightful. The dancing, and I agree with many other reviewers here, is great. If you're looking for mind-blowing technique and virtuosity, then Paris Opera Ballet isn't the right company for you--I'd suggest American Ballet Theatre, another fine company--but if you're interested in clean technique, beautiful lines, precision, and elegance, then you're going to like this DVD.",1149033600,11,527,5.1395348837209305
1995806,5,B0001FR0MA,"The video quality is superb.

Dancing is just fine.  I don't know why one of the reviewers said the dancing is mediocre.  This is a top class production in high quality video and audio.  It's beautiful.",1131408000,9,202,4.527777777777778
1995807,3,B0001FR0MA,"Pierre Lacotte calls himself the ""arqueologist of ballet"", and I think it's an accurate definition of his work.

""Paquita""(as a suite of dances) is one of the most popular ballets in the classical repertoire, with it's spanish-styled music, pyrotechnical pas de deux and variations, specially suited for small companies or ballet schools, (16 girls and 1 boy!) good male dancers are hard so to find.....

Lacotte took the so-called Paquita suite, recontructed a whole first act, and added the half of the second act, but he did it as if we were still in 1887! The coreography is so a-terre and old fashioned, it's just boring.

The whole production is gorgeous, stunning costumes and sets,paris opera has the best corps of the world,

soloists and etoiles are first class, it's a shame the dances could be more interesting.",1112400000,7,823,4.942028985507246
1995808,5,B0001FR0MA,"I bought this DVD just because it was performed by Paris Opera Ballet, but I was pleasantly surprised and I felt like having received an unexpected nice present. It was especially nice to see the other dancers (Letestu and Martinez) where it seems like most of their performance is dominated by DuPont and Legris (They are wonderful too). I read some ballet professional critic was writing against Paquette (not for this one but for other ballet), but I thought he expressed his role very well and his dance was dynamic and suitable. Letestu was beautiful and elegant and Martinez was the typical fairly tale prince. I really enjoyed it. I hope to see this partner in other performance too.",1107820800,12,690,4.80672268907563
1995809,4,B0001FR0MA,"Over the past few years the National Opera de Paris has produced some stunning DVDs of ballets. This latest is a reconstruction by Pierre Lacotte of a ballet that has not been seen in its entirety for many years. Of particular interest is the extensive use of mime in the second act to carry the story along. An interview with the dancers reveals how difficult they found the adoption of silent film techniques.

However, it is the dancing which makes or mars a production and this ballet has some excellent examples of Parisian technique at its finest. Both Jose Martinez and Agnes Letestu, the principals, turn in fine performances, as does Karl Paquette as one of the villains. The children of the ballet school perform admirably too, but it is the corps who are the stars of this show. They, and the sublime but brief appearance of Emmanuel Thibault, together with the surprisingly familiar music of the three composers involved, make this a DVD worth having. If one were to buy no DVDs of ballet except those of Paris one would still have a superb collection.",1096156800,23,1064,4.720430107526882

8011721,4,B0001FR0MA,"The story of Paquita dates from 1846 and the Spanish subject was designed to suit the exotic tastes of that time. The setting is in Spain at the time of the French Napoleonic occupation. Very briefly the plot concerns a young woman, Paquita, who was abducted by gypsies as a child and who, after several adventures, finds out that she is really of noble birth and thus able to marry the son of the occupying French General who has just fallen in love with her.

On the way to this conclusion the ballet is able to introduce a village festival with much village peasant dancing, a visiting band of gypsies with gypsy dancing and the final setting centres on much celebratory aristocratic dancing. The plot includes conflicting love interests, a failed poisoning and murder attempt, sliding doors, a wicked Spanish Governor, a noble French General and an heroic heroine who turns out to be the lost daughter of the above mentioned General's brother.

The choreography is by Petipa and the music mainly by Minkus. Both of these were skilled at their craft and their work will be familiar to lovers of traditional ballet such as this. The settings in this performance are very attractive with every effort being made to present the work with a wide range of appropriate costumes and staging. The orchestra under the reliable direction of David Coleman is faultless.

The lead roles of Paquita and Lucien are taken by Agnes Letestu and Jose Martinez. Both of these dance very well indeed, with a well-maintained rapport between them which makes their relationship believable in terms of the story. The gypsy leader, Karl Paquette, and the Governor, Jean-Marie Didiere, manage to deliver the required auras of evil. The corps de ballet fulfil the roles of villagers, gypsies and courtly dancers very well and there is a particularly effective scene where an extended polonaise is danced by the children of the company. This is exquisitely done.

In summary therefore, it would be fair to say that this is a totally enjoyable piece of escapist traditional ballet where the plot is simply an excuse for attractive choreography, costumes and staging. The music is lyrical and amenable without being distinctively authentic in terms of being Spanish or flamenco. For that you would need to go to Gades and a totally different experience not attempted here. The audience at this performance loved it and that is the best guide to its effectiveness.

The camera work delivers a nice balance of close and panoramic views and the sound is presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and stereo. This 2003 recording is not at the level of modern HD Blu-rays but is still able to give pleasure, particularly as there is currently no alternative. In my opinion a 4 star grading seems a fair assessment therefore.",1341792000,2,2780,4.88135593220339

8011724,4,B0001FR0MA,"I enjoyed this performance. I can understand why some people found it bland. Blame that on Pierre Lacotte. People must understand that this is a reconstruction of a ballet that has been largely lost. The only really authentic Petipa choreography that still exists is the Grand Pas that can be seen in various incarnations on DVD but who knows how true any of these are to the original choreography?

getting back to this performance, the reconstruction is by Pierre Lacotte who may be a fine ballet historian but who is an uninspired choreographer. One thing I must say about the dancing. It was an absolute delight to watch the ballerina's supported turns in the Grand Pas de Deux. They were perfectly gauged - as much to do with Martinez's superb partnering as with Letestu's turns - and the finishes were gorgeous, opening out like a flower. These were turns as true dance statements and not the usual race to get in as many turns as humanly possible in the time available.",1293926400,,976,4.707602339181286
