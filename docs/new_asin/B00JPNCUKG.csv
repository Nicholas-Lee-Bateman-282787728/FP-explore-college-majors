8652875,1,B00JPNCUKG,I'm sure the video itself is amazing but I bought the Blu Ray with intentions of watching it on my Xbox one and it would not read as a disc. I borrowed the Blu Ray to a friend and it wouldn't work in his ps4 either. Maybe it works fine in a legitimate Blu Ray player but if you intend on watching this on a gaming console it's not going to workout.,1423180800,,348,3.8472222222222223
