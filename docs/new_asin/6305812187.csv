1085630,5,6305812187,"I think this movie is so funny. I would love to own this on DVD, and I don't really understand why it isn't already, judging by all the other crap on DVD. If and when this is released on DVD I'll be sure to buy it.",1085616000,20,214,3.6739130434782608
1085631,5,6305812187,I have the VHS and I can say out of my video collection it is one of the funniest comedies I have seen for a while.  The movie starts rather normal and snowballs into a complete disaster fo the main characters.  My personal favorite moments are the Undead Cat and Kirsty Alley's breakdown(s) at her job (some of which hits almost too close to home).  I will be one of the first in line to get this title when it is finally released to DVD (hopefully in widescreen)!,1084406400,12,465,4.261363636363637

it is the funniest movie you will ever see about your relatives or friends that over stay their visit. they come for one day
and all of a sudden they have moved in to your house and you can not get them to leave a good home that is not there home. pay close attention and learn what to do. i have relative and friend

Take the whole weekend and watch it as many times in a row as you need to feel normal again.  Do the words ""Houseguests from Hell""  ring any bells with you? This movie is a masterpiece of bad timing.  I've seen it at least 50 times and never get tired of it.  It's a comedy of the highest order.

1085827,1,6305812187,"the transfer of the film is fine - anamorphic widescreen.
the film itself, though...is not good. i had vaguely it remembered it from when it was in theaters back in 1990 and since randomly seeing it was being re-released i preordered it. i am a huge fan of so-bad-they're-good films and will watch almost anything. this one, however was so implausible that i had trouble making it through the entire movie. there really is no plot other than a few annoying house guests arrive and overstay their welcome/wreak havoc. instead of just making all these people leave, kirstie alley and john larroquette put up with it. of course, if they didn't there would be no film, i get that. and that's my point -- this was so bad, it really shouldn't have even been made. the only remotely funny characer was jessica lundy as bernice.",1443484800,,820,4.662068965517242

1085830,5,6305812187,"Not often that a film has everything. Perfect actors, script, direction and all the rest that goes into a great film. One of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I could watch it everyday. Kirsty is an incredibly talented actress. Her sense of timing and facial expressions are clearly apparent. John Laroquette is his usual subtle, understated but balanced on the edge mode. How these two kept straight faces while doing this is a credit to their abilities. I'll keep my VHS player around just so I can keep watching this film.",1400630400,,530,4.709677419354839

I for one can not understand what the hold up is? Its going on 21 years now and I'm tired of waiting for something that's never going to happen (at least not in my lifetime). Its too bad because this is one funny, funny movie that I would love to add to my collection. Oh well, if this movie ever does get released on DVD please give a ""head's up"" . Until then I'm deleting this item so I won't have to constantly reminded that I am not getting this any time soon. No, I no longer own a VHS player any more so I have no need for a VHS tape copy either. That's how long this movie has been MIA in terms of popular media formats!",1333152000,,804,3.938650306748466

1085908,5,6305812187,"I don't get why there are so many films, so many good films that haven't been released on dvd. This movie is loads of fun and anyone who has family members who they want to kill sometimes can relate. It's about a couple who are gradually forced from their home when family members start moving in. This movie ROCKs... every time I go to the store I look for this title just in case. I heard MGM went out of business... sitting on material like this, I only wonder why they do things like release the James Bond series in a bunch of different versions and never put out some fresh stuff that collectors can spend their money on... I big freakin' DUH... and a wake-up call for distributors and studios!

I want... Gleaming the Cube - 1984 - the Witches (Widescreen) - the Juror (Widescreen) - With Honors (Widescreen) - Electric Dreams - the Quest/Frog Dreaming",1321920000,,859,4.471337579617835
1085909,5,6305812187,"Kirstie and John are two of the many great things this film has going for it. The houseguests are very obnoxious, to say the least. The script is a riot, and the storyline reminds me of a similiar incident I went through a few years ago, except the outcome wasn't nearly as funny. The music composed by David Newman, as always fit each mood perfectly. If you like screwball comedies with a vengeful streak, check into MADHOUSE, you won't want to leave either!
Final note: where's the DVD?",1309651200,2,488,4.556818181818182

1085961,5,6305812187,"John & Kirstie have abundant chemistry between them on screen.  You can't help but laugh.  Drug deals, bleacher seats for watching tv, undead cats, arson, explosions, attempted murder with chainsaws... Yup we've all been there and done that when we have had houseguests that WOULDN'T GO AWAY!

1085963,5,6305812187,"Of late, Comedy Central has been showing this with additional deleted footage. This movie deserves a re-release on DVD with all the additional expurgated footage. Larroquette and the rest of the female cast are superb (Miller and Diehl are merely window dressing) Alley as the frazzled news anchor, LaPlaca as the golddigger wife, and Lundy as the quintessential Jersey girl (not bad for a San Diegan) Some of the lines in the movie are priceless (IMDb has some of the more memorable ones) The movie still has not lost its humor as it ages. Wonderful ensemble acting and great script, one of the best comedies of the nineties.",1190332800,7,626,4.805555555555555
1085964,5,6305812187,"This is definitely the movie to own.  Although if it would come out as a DVD as a RErelease it would definitely be one you'd want to buy.  It stars John Larroquette, Kirstie Alley, Dennis Miller, John Diehl, Alison LePlaca, Jessica Lundy.  It starts off with Mark and Jessie Bannister (Larroquette and Alley) enjoying their home and what they're accomplished in it with the exception of their broken toilet.  Jessie works for a TV news station doing nothing but surveys, Mark works at an insurance company and when they receive word that their good friends are coming to town to visit, that's when the excitement begins.  The mysterious part is THE CAT.  No matter how many times Scruffy the cat dies, he comes back.  First the cat dies of drowning in the fish tank, then it dies of being squashed, then the cat dies of a crack overdose.  The sick part is when they first encounter the cat and it showers cat vomit ALL.......OVER....THEM.  And you can just see Kirstie Alley showered in it.  When their friends start to leave and head back home, she slips and falls to the ground and ends up having to stay with them.  OH Lundy leads them all to believe she's pregnant and ready to have a baby.  But, it turned out she wasn't.  Mark and Jessie do all they can to not just get rid of their friends but, Jessie's sister who gets thrown out (Alison LePlaca), their next door neighbor (John Diehl) and one mishap after another happens.

7897152,1,6305812187,"I bought this movie because the house is in my neighborhood in Tucson, about two blocks away from me.  There was also a scene at the Rialto Theater, Hotel Congress, various downtown locations and the airport in Tucson, along with a few in an office building with a view of Tucson and Mount Lemmon.

But the movie itself is TERRIBLE.  We ended up fast forwarding to catch Tucson's locations.  The acting is awful.  The story predictable and over-the-top ridiculous rather than humorous.  I suppose it might have been funny in the 90s when the actors were more relevant--who didn't watch Cheers and Night Court back in the day??  But I'm sorry to say the film did not withstand the test of time.

Keeping the DVD as a fun ""I know that place!"" historical document, but I'd rather watch paint dry... and yes, that was less clichd than the film itself.",1501804800,,847,4.6
