5683048,5,B00BZABWN8,"While Mary Millington doesn't actually star in this movie she does have a couple of good scenes-especially the irrigation scene.  There is also an extra that is a short tribute to her with some nude scenes from Playbirds.
The picture quality of the movie is good with lots of nudity from women and some from men.  There is also a couple of song and dance numbers and a good bit of comedy.",1427414400,8,388,4.375

5683050,4,B00BZABWN8,"When I learned Come Play With Me was about to be released on DVD, it reignited my interest in its best-known figure, Mary Millington.  I first learned of her over a decade ago through Simon Sheridan's biography, also titled Come Play With Me.  Mary Millington could be seen as the UK's answer to Linda Lovelace; they were perhaps the first adult film stars to win mainstream celebrity.  While Lovelace would later become an antipornography crusader, Millington, to the end of her life, remained a proponent of freedom in sexual expression.  Sadly, it was not to be a long life.  Inland Revenue was after her for not paying her taxes, the police harassed her for her work in the sex industry and a cocaine addiction was bringing on paranoia and reckless behavior.  It all culminated in her 1979 suicide.  Come Play With Me was released in 1977 and it set records by playing constantly on British screens for four years, thanks mostly to the relentless promotion by producer David Sullivan.  I was prepared to be let down as Sheridan comments that this is not really Millington's best work. She has only two big scenes but she was a favorite in Sullivan's line of adult magazines as well as his lover and he insisted on giving her star billing. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised; it might not be a great film, but it does succeed in its own limited way.  The plot involves two counterfeiters hiding at an estate that the lady of the manor hopes to convert to a health resort.  Her nephew arrives with a group of strippers (including Millington) and he has the idea of having the girls dress up as nurses and give rather sexy treatments to the guests.  The humor is reminiscent of Benny Hill, albeit with more nudity (but softcore; while not rated, I'd put it in the R range).  I was reminded that at the time of the film's release, the sexual revolution was hitting its stride and Come Play With Me was no doubt a chance for viewers to enjoy a bit of permissive naughtiness in the new era (but like Mary Millington herself, this era would prove short-lived; AIDS was already starting to incubate).  I suppose I can conclude with a double recommendation; for the film itself, which has to be one of British cinema's more unusual success stories and for Simon Sheridan's book for the in-depth look at its creation and its star.",1416700800,14,2325,4.627737226277373
8575761,1,B00BZABWN8,The write up talked about a scene at the end that never materialized. This movie was a total waste of time and money. A bunch of old British guys with a whole lot of talking and Benny Hill type slap stick humor but no real story and no intercourse of any kind. I tossed it.,1519948800,,273,3.981818181818182

8575763,1,B00BZABWN8,IMDB lists this as a 94 minute movie.  Who wants to watch a censored movie????,1514419200,4,78,4.2
8575764,4,B00BZABWN8,The name and photo made me think it was a soft porn. When it appeared under comedy I thought it worth a look. It's your typical quirky British humor. The estate owner opened a health spa. Two men wanted for making counterfeit money are hiding out. When the owners grandson shows up with a bus load of burlesque dancers he decides to use the ladies as sexy nurses who walk around naked. When new guests arrive the criminals start to loose their cool and the comedy ensues. Not a sex movie as it's just topless woman. Compared to showtime and hbo it's rather tame,1514419200,2,561,4.403846153846154

8575766,2,B00BZABWN8,"The women indeed entertain, but keep it below hardcore level.  The story accompanying other than the women however, is ridiculous.  Too bad Benny Hill didn't get past the censorship to this degree, that would have been a winning combination.  But this is not Benny Hill caliber.

1970's softcore, with enough heavy British accent used by some of the guys to make you need subtitles.  But ultimately you realize this isn't meant to be taken seriously whatsoever and only considered as a vehicle to give tribute to a handful of comely ladies willing to share with the camera for the sake of getting a similar tour like viewing through a National Geographic magazine.  You get to see beautiful places that you'll never get to visit in person.

The primary reason for viewing this film will be lightly satisfied, but the attempt at comedy or a story becomes a tedious waste of the viewer's time unless they are in the film, produced the film, make royalties off of the marketing of the film, etc etc.  Obviously the 2 stars rating is for the British burlesque and beyond that which this film more or less delivers.",1509148800,,1110,4.715025906735751

8575768,4,B00BZABWN8,There's not enough of Mary Millington in this film and the humor is sometimes fall flat but it still is one of the great British sex films of the 70's and Mary does steal the few scenes she is in.,1483833600,4,196,3.925
