8297532,5,B001EBO94M,"This is an amazing live performance of the classic and timeless Berlin album by Lou Reed.
This live performance is much better than the original 1973 version.
The audio quality of the 5.1 Blu-ray soundtrack is amazing, this has now become my demo material for showing off my stereo system and it's capabilities.
The songs Candy Says (with Antony) and Rock Minuet are powerful and will bring tears to your eyes, not only due to the poetic and sad lyrics written by Lou, but due to the great performance and Antony's great voice and spirit.
Do not hesitate for a second, buy this right now and you will never regret it!",1386979200,2,617,4.5675675675675675

8297534,1,B001EBO94M,"Ok so I am not a huge Lou fan but putting that aside this is one of poorest excuses for entertainment I have had the misfortune of viewing and  listening to!
The visuals are not even DVD quality.
The sound takes you from levels experienced in The Exorcist or something Beethoven could feel to the voices of angels in a girls choir! Like WTF?
Sorry I must be getting older or its that there is too much better out there.
I feel its the latter this is just a poor excuse for entertainment and doesn't merit one more written word of time period!",1338249600,3,542,4.262135922330097
