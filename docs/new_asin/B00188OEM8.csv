3412393,5,B00188OEM8,"What I'd really like to know is why seasons 2-6 of this show aren't available when they all were aired years ago. Even season 6, which aired in 2007, is not available now, two years later. Why the holdup?",1247875200,37,204,4.256410256410256

3412397,5,B00188OEM8,I loves this series. I am also wondering why there is such a long wait for 2-6 to be relased in DVD format. Atleast you want the show streaming in Netflix. That's what I did.,1339113600,,174,4.0

3412401,5,B00188OEM8,"I love this show, so after reading these comments, I decided to do some research to find out why I still couldn't get it on DVD.  This is what I found on Wikipedia, ""The inability of NBC to secure music rights has prevented the show, which relies heavily on pop music in its soundtrack, from being released on DVD. However on the NBC.com blog, it was announced in January 2007 that this problem may soon be resolved.[12][13] The first season was released on DVD on May 6, 2008[14] and there is no notice of substitution of music on the DVD packaging.[5] As of July 2011 seasons 2 through 6 remain unreleased.""",1310688000,34,609,4.486486486486487
3412402,5,B00188OEM8,This is such a terrific show!  Please complete the series soon!  I wish the show was still in production.  Cancellation was such a disappointment!  Please let us have the availability of the DVD's to re-enjoy!!!,1303171200,2,211,4.942857142857143

3412404,5,B00188OEM8,"I am a diehard ""Crossing Jordan"" fan who would really appreciate seeing the remaining seasons released on DVD. Amazon could you please help make this happen? I am 62 years old. While I plan to live to the age of 100 years so I can appear on the Smucker's Jar on the Today Show among other reasons, it would be nice to have them available now. Thank you.",1294358400,7,353,4.205882352941177
8268844,5,B00188OEM8,"I have Season One, and have had it for years. I refuse to watch it though, until I can get the other seasons, so that I don't get disappointed at the end of season one, when I can go no further. Someone PLEASE figure out a way to release them soon, so that everyone waiting can finally buy them!",1435017600,,295,4.016949152542373
8268845,5,B00188OEM8,"Well, it's 2015 and fans are still waiting for seasons 2-6.  What gives?  Many lousy series are available on DVD.  There can't be that many legal issues. Someone DO SOMETHING1",1420329600,3,175,4.766666666666667
8268846,5,B00188OEM8,"I love Crossing Jordan.  I had never watched Crossing Jordan until it was on TNT in syndication.  I watched it because I liked Jill Hennessy in Law & Order.

I found that I loved the storyline, plot and characters.  I also loved it because it was an intelligent show.

I am waiting for the remaining seasons to be released on DVD.  We should all write to NBC and urge them to release them.  That way they will know that there is a market.",1376438400,4,438,4.204819277108434
8268847,5,B00188OEM8,"As of 05/27/2013 People are still awaiting for the rest of the Seasons to be released. I have constantly googled this w/ very little results.
What can us fans do to get these DVD's released for purchase. It's been quite awhile since Season 1 was released. I am very interested in the other seasons.
Can anyone help us Crossing Jordan fans?????",1369612800,4,343,4.639344262295082
8268848,5,B00188OEM8,"I think I speak for most other fans of this show when I say that I'd be willing to pay a bit more than the standard TV box set pricing if it helped to get the music clearances needed to release the remaining seasons on DVD. This is a great show, and I'd love to finally retire my VHS collection (yep, I recorded every episode when it became clear that the DVDs weren't coming anytime soon!) and have a chance to share the show with friends who have never seen it. DVDs, please!!!",1369267200,3,479,4.161290322580645
8268849,3,B00188OEM8,"Over all this show has a ""Halloweenish"" feel to it.

It is an OK show as far as the stories go. But as it progresses, there are more and more gruesome scenes of really gross dead bodies on the autopsy table, horrid looking decomposed corpses and other really yucky scenes of maggots eating corpses etc.

I feel grossed out that these images are forever stored in my mind. I don't think that it is necessary for the stories to show these scenes, it will be possible to just make a suggestion of them, without actually showing us all these gruesome images. And the show springs these gross images on the viewer in an obvious attempt to shock us.

And the fact that the women doctors in the medical examiner office are as gorgeous as super models, makes the show even more bizarre.",1364515200,,778,4.464788732394366
8268850,5,B00188OEM8,"I was able to actually stream all 5 seasons, thru my local Cable company. However, they will soon be dropping the complete series around 02/2013. The Music, acting, storylines were so well done! Jill Hennessy! WOW, acting, and her character just left me SAD! when the Network, cancelled it. so they could come up with HEROS! Paled in comparison, and did not last as long as CROSSSING JORDAN! Perhaps, some people do not realize this but she preformed many of the songtracks on several episodes. There is ONE C.D. Available, with many of the original tracks from the first couple of seasons> BUY season 1, if you haven't, and the c.d. as well. You can pick both up fairly cheap. BUT I REALLY WANT SEASONS 2 THRU 6! New or used! But not blackmarket! I guess I will wait, after all it is now 2013!",1358553600,4,794,4.482758620689655
8268851,5,B00188OEM8,I was excited when i found season one available and as much as i like watching it over and over i would like to have the rest of the series. Please nbc if anyone actually can release the remaining seasons i would greatly appreciate it.,1355529600,3,235,4.2444444444444445
8268852,2,B00188OEM8,"Not understanding why there is a holdup in releasing the remaining seasons out on DVD. Funny how other shows, that just ended like 'HOUSE' already has released their last season on dvd... but Crossing Jordan has not? Would really like to know why, cause i loved the show and would like to own it. Come on! Can someone give us an update already?",1351468800,4,344,4.476190476190476
8268853,5,B00188OEM8,Please make all Crossing Jordan seasons available! I can only watch season 1 over and over again. I did a search and you can buy all 6 seasons. I just don't know and trust the sellers.,1347840000,5,184,4.138888888888889
