2334613,3,B0009XRZCO,"This is okay; but it has too many cartoons that I have never heard of. When I ordered it, I thought I would be getting cartoons like: mighty mouse, woody woodpecker and others like them; but it just had a few of those and the rest was mostly cartoons that I didn't care for and ones that I never saw or heard of before. This DVD has the same cartoons that are mostly on Mighty Mouse and Friends Vol. 1; so if you don't want to order the same ones; just order Mighty Mouse and Friends Vol. 1.",1394323200,5,491,4.020408163265306

2334615,1,B0009XRZCO,"What a disappointment. Such a waste of resources, the publisher of this DVD is committing crimes against nature. There is nothing on this DVD worth the time to unwrap it. I resent having paid for garbage.",1330128000,,204,4.694444444444445
2334616,1,B0009XRZCO,Our 4 year old son loves the classic cartoons.. especially Woody Woodpecker.  It didn't capture him at all.  I would recommend the Mickey Mouse cartoon classics... he loves everyone that we bought so far.,1268265600,6,204,4.970588235294118

8069681,1,B0009XRZCO,This says Volume 2 (16 cartoons) but it has every cartoon that Volume 1 (35 cartoons) has.  Waste of money.,1473638400,,107,4.35

8069684,1,B0009XRZCO,"This is the worst.  Not what is stated in the description.  Heck, not even what is stated on the DVD case.  Quality is poor but the content is just awful.  Got this cause it said it had Mighty Mouse and Woody Woodpecker.  Not on there.  What was?  A bunch of creepy puppet like shows and other junk no one would watch.",1437609600,5,318,4.114754098360656
8069685,2,B0009XRZCO,"Don't waste your money.  Very much the same as other DVDs called ""TV cartoon classics"".  Only one Mighty Mouse and one Woody Woodpecker cartoon.",1433030400,2,144,4.958333333333333
