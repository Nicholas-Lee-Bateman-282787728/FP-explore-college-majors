8588473,5,B00D29AB7S,"It is wonderful that the World Wide Pictures classics are being presented in the ""Billy Graham Presents"" DVD series, and it is great to finally have them on DVD.  THE HEART IS A REBEL is no exception.

However, somewhat sadly, these DVDs were made using the same masters which were used to make the former VHS releases of the 1990s, so don't look for much picture improvement (except for a bit less ""video noise"" since you are not reproducing from VHS tape).

Video transfer technology has come so far since these video masters were made (probably in the early 1990s or so) [mind you, I'm NOT talking about the film itself, but about the master *video* transfer OF that film, from which these DVDs were made].  I was hoping for the sparkling images that one gets from *today's* digital transfer technology.  But alas, they simply used the video masters from the 1990s.

This does not mean that the picture looks ""bad"".  No, the colors are vibrant and contrast levels are, if not optimum, at least ""quite good"".  If you have not owned these films before on VHS, by all means purchase them in this DVD series!

However, if, like me, you already own them on VHS and are looking for a step up to the superb updated picture quality of today's modern digital transfers of older films, you may wish to just stick with your VHS.

I do understand that to re-master a film digitally is not an inexpensive proposition, and probably the folks at BGEA/WWP didn't feel that sales of these older films would justify the expense.

Still, even so, I'm a bit disappointed because one tends to assume that, if they have waited until 2013 to release a DVD of an older film, that it will have been recently transferred digitally.  Otherwise --if you were just going to use the old master anyway-- why wait until 2013 to release them on DVD?  Just doesn't quite add up.

Also, just FYI, the discs do not seem to have been authored with menus.  They begin with a short ""commercial"" for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, and then the film just starts right off, no menu.  This is NOT a big deal; however, a simple ""play all"" menu using the case artwork wouldn't have added much cost and would have added ""class"" to the DVD.  Viewers today expect a DVD to have a menu.

We will certainly take these wonderful classic films however we can get them, and be grateful for that..... however, it is a shame not to see them presented at their best.  Sadly, even the more recent (and quite excellent) CAUGHT (1987) has not been re-transferred digitally, but instead appears to use the 1990s master transfer.

However, again, if you don't have these films already, get them.  The quality of THE HEART IS A REBEL is quite good (given that the film print they used was not a new print either).  I'd give it a B+ for quality, which isn't bad for an older classic film.  But it's just not the sparkling, crisp digital transfer that we associate with new digital transfers of classic films, and that is rather a shame.

I still have to give it 5 stars --out of sheer gratitude-- because these films deserve to be on DVD!",1379894400,6,3090,4.5461121157323685
