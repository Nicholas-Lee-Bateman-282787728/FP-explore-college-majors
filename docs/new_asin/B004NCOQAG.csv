8436590,1,B004NCOQAG,Takes wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much time to get to the point.  TONS of senseless talking.  This could be GREAT if he would get to the point and work examples much quicker!!,1407369600,,172,4.7
8436591,5,B004NCOQAG,"How much of your course this set covers depends on what version of the class you are taking and how your school sets up its math curriculum.  At the community college level the calculus sequence usually has 4 levels, with calculus 1 being differential calculus, calculus 2 covering integrals, and calculus 3 and 4 being either multivariable calculus or a class combining basic linear algebra and basic differential equations (basically split in half).  In that situation many times differential equations are introduced in calculus 2 toward the end of the semester, then the rest is covered in calculus 3 or 4 (whatever order your school puts them in).  At the university level you usually have the option of taking basic differential equations (which is what most engineering students take) or the ""full blown"" course which is what the math majors usually take.

In the community college scenario the material covered in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Calculus-Differential-Equations-Tutor-Vol-One-First-Order-Equations-Four-Disc-Edition/dp/B003WRBPFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Calculus Differential Equations Tutor: Vol. One - First Order Equations (Four-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;will cover pretty much everything you will be exposed to in calculus 2, and the very beginning of what you would get in the differential equations half of the linear algebra/diff eq hybrid class.  This material will fill out most of the rest of what you would get in the hybrid class.  It covers higher order differential equations and the various techniques used to solve them.

Like the rest of Jason's videos he walks step by step through each problem.  Occasionally he will skip steps to save space, but he always lets you know that he is doing so when he does, and will say why.  Usually it is because the math is either so trivial someone at this level will know what to do, or because he did the exact same thing in a prior problem.  That said, he does not do it often.  He goes through several examples of varying complexity to give you a good flavor for what to expect.  He does not however go through every kind of problem you will encounter though so do not fall into the trap of thinking that this is a replacement for class.

As one of the other reviewers mentioned this does not cover Laplace Transforms, which will be introduced in one or two class sessions at the very end of the basic version of the class, and covered more extensively in the full blown version of the course.  Jason does now have a Laplace Transform DVD set out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Laplace-Transform-Tutor/dp/B00GNIFHZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Laplace Transform Tutor</a>&nbsp;which gives a ton of examples (and the best discussion of what it is I have seen) using Laplace Transforms.  If you are taking the basic version of the class it is probably way more than you need.  I am not sure how much from the full blown version of the class it covers.  But I do know that Laplace Transforms will come up again for many engineering majors (especially EE majors) so it will still be useful.",1406592000,,3170,5.346076458752515
8436592,5,B004NCOQAG,Mr. Gibson's ability to convey the important information about a subject shines through as usual.  I wish I had had him as a teacher when I was in college.  Well worth the money.,1390521600,2,178,4.363636363636363
8436593,5,B004NCOQAG,"I like it plenty.
It was what I was expecting .
Since I saw this product
I knew that it was what I was needing",1369094400,4,110,3.44
8436594,5,B004NCOQAG,"I bought the Differential Equations Tutor DVDs because I was taking the course and saw that the creator's other math tutorial DVDs got great reviews, so I decided to try it out. The DVDs turned out to be a great help and explained the topics in a clear albeit little slow manner (which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the fast forward button is definitely an option if you understand the topic).

The first DVD only covers the first couple of weeks in the course which for my class were the first two chapters. These consist of explaining what a differential equation is and showing how to solve first order differential equations (DE) and their applications to real life. The instruction was clear but you should watch the videos either before going to class or after. Don't leave them to watch before your midterm they are way too long to watch all at once.

The second volume is definitely needed if you want to learn how to solve higher order DEs, linear DEs, and homogeneous & non-homogeneous DEs, using the various methods introduced in your math course.

NOTE: The DVDs don't teach you past this and don't contain Laplace transforms (which for me were the second half of the course)! Maybe they will be covered in a third volume which hasn't been released yet but just make sure you find a different source to help you if you need help with them.

Also buy the DVDs from the company itself it'll save you a few bucks.",1315785600,6,1426,4.55859375
