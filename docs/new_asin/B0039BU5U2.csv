8392038,5,B0039BU5U2,"The raunchy danish comedy, Klown, is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it many times before discovering it was based on a hit TV series from Denmark, Klovn.  This set is 60 half-hour doses of the same squirm-inducing and hilarious humor that made the movie so much fun, featuring the same characters and actors.  Can't wait to see the movie sequel, Klown Forever.",1448496000,,382,4.686567164179104
8392039,5,B0039BU5U2,Such a great show. Love it. Every episode is hysterical!,1439164800,,56,4.7
8392040,5,B0039BU5U2,"This show is great,  mainly due to the great chemistry between Frank & Casper. Have not seen a bad episode.

Some of the topics can be fairly offensive, but they still make you laugh.

8392041,5,B0039BU5U2,"Heavy ""Curb"" influence, but far from a remake.  The characters and stories are mostly unique, though the setting is similar-ish. Ultimately, this is a hysterical show.  Great outrageousness and irreverence.  I laughed out loud at least once each episode.",1383868800,3,254,5.461538461538462
8392042,5,B0039BU5U2,"Basically a Danish Curb Your Enthusiasm concept but I'd have to say the confrontations that Frank gets himself into are a lot more natural/believable that Larry David's. I recommend this to any fan of Larry David's Curb, but understand its a completely different show/episodes, just a similar concept....and .....music. English subtitles do the show justice and the jokes translate well.
