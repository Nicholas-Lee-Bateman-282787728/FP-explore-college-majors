7905922,4,B00000DGHM,"I`m writing because a reviewer said that the woman throwing her child and then herself off of a cliff was because of her fear of the American Marines. This is not the truth at all. This happened on Saipan, the Japanese commander of the island ordered all the civilians to comment suicide. The Marines had a interpreter that was begging the people from a loudspeaker to choose to live, a few did most didn`t. I learned this when I watched the documentary (OUR TIME IN HELL narrated by Lee Marvin) an excellent film.",1123804800,10,514,4.537634408602151

7905924,3,B00000DGHM,"It is very different to watch WWII movies in color. Most of us are accustomed to the black and white scenes that are so very familiar.
World War II in color is rather chilling. To see the war, its graphicness, its  horror, even the mundane in color you get a more realistic view.
The  Video, which is actually two tapes concentrates mainly on events in the  Pacific Theater of Operations.  I found this to be disappointing since the  European Thearter received such a lack of attention.  But the scenes  dealing with Europe are good, especially scenes of the V-2 rocket.
Should  you buy this video?  If your main interest in World War II lies in the  Pacific then yes.  If not then this video is not a ""must have"".",958176000,19,714,4.457364341085271
7905925,5,B00000DGHM,This is a compilation of very high-quality color footage of various World War II battles.  Particularly gripping are scenes from the battle of Tarawa and allied bombing raids over Germany.  Emphasis tilted to footage of the  Pacific theatre versus european.  Recommended for WWII buffs.,947030400,11,286,5.431818181818182
7905926,5,B00000DGHM,"The only other documentary available of WW II utilizing color footage, that I am aware of, is the incredible one by George Stevens Jr, ""D-Day to Berlin."" It was therefore a revelation to purchase ""WW II In  Color"" (from Amazon, I might add). I was surprised to see footage of  both the European and South Pacific theaters (but some of it far too  graphic for the eyes of children). If this documentary had the  extraordinary script (narration) and musical score that ""D-Day to  Berlin"" has, it would be of equal emotional impact. Regardless, this a  most valuable look at WW II as it actually was seen (or much closer, that  is). Included is footage taken and/or directed by Hollywood directors, John  Ford, William Wyler, and both repeated and new footage from the camera of  George Stevens (re: ""D-Day to Berlin""). The reproduction of the  color is quite excellent and the sound, often a problem with  WW II  documentaries, is very good here. Highly recommended.",923356800,31,964,4.810975609756097
