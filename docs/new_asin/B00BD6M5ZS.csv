5580413,5,B00BD6M5ZS,Most TV is dreadful and Scandinavia is the best source for sensible believable stories and characters. I look forward to series III.,1375315200,3,132,5.045454545454546
5580414,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"Borgen is often compared to ""The West Wing,"" but that is deceptive, because Denmark is a small country and there is much less pomp and circumstance. Here the character development is much more nuanced and interesting than it is in TWW",1375315200,3,234,4.7317073170731705
5580415,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"As good as Season 1- i cannot wait to see Season three which is supposedly coming to Europe soon ,",1375315200,2,98,3.95
5580416,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"We never buy movies or TV, except maybe to stream Mad Men or Justified when they become available. This series has been touted all over, and it lives up to the hype. We bought the first series, watched it and sold it through Amazon. Bought this as soon as it became available, and will buy Season Three as well. Wish they were available streaming, but...

This continues the saga of the first female prime minister of Denmark, her ""spin doctor"" and his on-again/off-again journalist girlfriend. Every one of the main characters is complex, flawed, yet appealing. Plots derive from the characters, rather than melodramatically being imposed, for the most part,although the high-stakes politics seems very real.

Top notch TV!",1373932800,14,724,5.07563025210084
5580417,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"The series is great but my second season dvd box came without episodes 14,15,16 and two discs of ep. 11-13!

5580419,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"An excellant series with superb performances by all the cast.  My only complaint is that sometimes the dialogue is quite rapid, and, not being able to speak Danish, I read the sub-titles and in doing so I feel I miss out a little on the excellent visuals.  A truly addictive series, I know that I'll be watching it avidly for the 2nd time shortly.  This series was recommended by friends after a discussion involving the Swedish series of ""Wallender""  They felt this ""Borgan"" was of a similar calibre, although of course the subjects are very different and I can't help but agree.  Absolutely captivating !!",1472428800,,607,4.742857142857143

5580430,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"I love this series. Strong female characters, plenty of backroom deal making, and coalition politics at its best. It doesn't quite get as preachy as West Wing, but Episode 19 is probably as good as it gets.

Even when she could have saved it she told her husband to just go have an affaire but discreet about it because of her public image. She stood by while her son's emotional issues as a result of her behavior took hold. Then her daughter, for the same reasons, was practically committed for an emotion al break down. But yet they march on preaching their ideology. I guess if you have one thing to say for these liberals they are good little soldiers. Too bad they are too dumb to see the destructiveness of their policies. ""Did you think I was really just going to go be a house wife""?!?! Wow. How insulting to mothers around the world. How brazenly declaring your ignorance. ""Let me clear. Your being PM did not cause your daughter to have a breakdown""??!?!?! What!?!? Way to justify your misbehavior. This monster cared more for African children than her own. Anyway, I will say one thing for this character. She was correct when she told her husband that he quit on them too soon, which really begs the question what kinda marriage/husband was he? He was a loser. A horrible husband and father. But that is a liberal man for you. ALl of these people are a case study for one liberal trait: weak selfishness.",1423872000,,1346,4.6125

5580444,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"Excellent political drama. Fascinating to observe how the Prime Minister finds herself having to compromise on various issues, especially in contrast to the early episodes of Season 1 when she was more idealistic, but without experience, and without the toughness needed to survive the rough game of politics.

The side drama of her personal life adds to the overall mix of good drama, both political and personal.",1421193600,,414,5.17910447761194

5580452,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"This is a fantastic must-see series from Denmark provides intelligent and stimulating drama for those who love overseas films. This series is very well done from the writing, filming and direction to the consistently fabulous acting that is both understated and realistic. It is character driven, the main plot of each episode ties in with past story lines. It reveals a unique insight into the Danish political parliamentary system and the Danish way of life. The viewer gets a hands on feel as to how gov't is run, with ministers doing deals, exploiting each other's weak and strong points. Denmark is a small country and as such appears much more accessible and accountable say, than the humongous USA and also offers a unique perspective from a small yet significant country.

Best parts are the realistic characters, plots and humanity of the players and their families. Borgen depicts the consequences of political pressure, secrets, behind the scenes wheeling and dealing and of course, the spin put out for public consumption. Really like the normal looking actors and didn't realize what a distraction it is when overly made up, surgically enhanced (fake looking) actors are used. While the Danes are already an attractive group, the actors look completely normal, lacking in vanity. They have bad hair days, gain a few pounds, are not anorexic thin, wear normal high street clothes, even their homes look realistic. It made the series much more accessible, this humble aspect made such a positive impact.

All three seasons are wonderful in different ways. The first season sets the stage, the second gets down to the nitty gritty and the third while a bit slower paced, picks up at the end for a wonderful completion to this very entertaining series.

Well done, Denmark!",1415664000,3,1782,5.033898305084746
5580453,5,B00BD6M5ZS,Fascinating.  A compelling story and a civics lesson rolled into one.  Easy to follow subtitles.,1415491200,,96,5.333333333333333

5580458,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"Continuation of the brilliant Danish television series looking at what happens when an idealistic politician becomes the first female prime minister. If you liked the first season of House of Cards, you'll see where the Netflix series got some of its ideas: the young female reporter, the cynical campaign aide, family problems among the pols). But Borgen is far more real than House of Cards and while knowing a bit about Denmark and recent controversies in northern Europe such as US relations, the EU, and Muslim immigration, will add an extra level of enjoyment, it's certainly not necessary. Friends of ours love Borgen without having spent more than a day anywhere in Scandinavia. As an added bonus, the series will also help you understand why a parliamentary system can be just as dysfunctional as our US two-party system.",1410307200,,830,5.021739130434782
5580459,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"An absolute treat for anyone who enjoys Nordic Noir, political intrigue and a dash of good old-fashioned soap opera. When Season 2 arrived, my husband couldn't wait to view the first episode. And this is a man who adamantly refuses to watch anything but the nightly news, PBS specials and the occasional football game. But given the brilliant script writing, seamless acting and compelling plot lines, who can blame him for his growing addiction to Borgen? We think of it as our favorite European import and are happily sharing it with friends, who are also falling under its spell. The only problem is, what the heck are we going to do once we've seen the last episode of the final season (#3)?",1410220800,,695,4.704918032786885

5580465,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"If you want to see sophisticated television with compelling characters who lead what seem to be real lives with real problems and challenges, this is it.  While some of the political ""solutions"" that result at the penultimate moment in a given episode are a bit hokey - a la The West Wing - the effects of the events on the lives of the dozen or so major characters in the series is full of nuance, with heartbreak and euphoria alike.  Bonus: the major characters are very easy to look at.

Subtitled in English, but easy to follow.  (Note: the characters often use English, almost always when dealing with foreigners.  Their English is as good as that of a native speaker.)",1408406400,,674,4.583333333333333

5580470,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"An intense, brilliantly written,  superbly directed, and  masterfully played drama. That a story about Danish politics could absorb our full attention and those to whom we recommended it was a revelation. Political intrigue, ambition, and the drive for power are universal; and, lessons about democracy in general and Danish interpretations and challenges to make the system effective in particular made this a great series. The subplots involving the characters' personal lives did not distract from the central thrust of the of the story. This is one of the best of the genre!",1406419200,,578,5.271739130434782

5580476,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"You must see Season 1 to really appreciate this series. Birgitte Nyborg is the politician we all wish we could vote for. She is faced with all the problems a woman and a politican can face, but through it all she clings to her own personal integrity. What a wonderful character she is!

Season 1, everyone a little too perfect, but season two shows the many layers of each characters, as stresses reveal them.  Gives a more realistic picture of the difficulty of political compromise and getting things done, as well as the difficulty of dealing with public media.  Some big surprises along the way.

5580479,4,B00BD6M5ZS,"After hearing about this show for so long I decided it was time to watch.  It does not take long to understand the Danish Political System, and is interesting to see how precarious their positions are.  The actors are superb and the show entertaining.  There is one thing that is hard to understand.  She is the Prime Minister yet she lives in a home with no household help, and the husband cannot take a good job as he is needed for babysitting cooking and shopping.  Since he was a former CEO this is not challenging for him.  Yet, when they discuss him getting the job he wants it is difficult as who will watch the children. Who, by the way, are not babies.  In the PM country house it is grand and there is top notch help, but at home nothing??  Also, Katrina, the successful news person lives in almost squalor.  I know it shows she does not care, but please, perhaps the Danish feel that luxury is not important?  There was also a story about the CIA landing in Greenland.  Greenland is under the jurisdiction of Denmark.  They mentioned these ""innocents"" from Afghanistan were in custody.  That was interesting as they did not know if they were terrorists or innocent.  That was a bit political and anti American.  However, the show is very entertaining as you watch someone going from nice innocent to hardened politician",1401235200,,1330,4.576271186440678
5580480,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"This is an intelligent, thoughtful,  and down to earth portrayal of the workings of a countries government.  One of the best of any kind I have ever watched.",1400371200,,157,4.571428571428571
5580481,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"I never buy DVDs, but after watching Season 1 at a friend's I had to have the rest of this excellent Danish series. Great acting, beautiful settings. My only complaint is with the subtitles. I am sure they were saying much more than we were given, which is frustrating.",1398470400,,269,4.510204081632653
5580482,5,B00BD6M5ZS,Maybe the best political series ever; the lead actress is an astonishment.  The writing and acting is superb. Bravo Borgen.,1397865600,,123,5.15
5580483,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"Season 1 of BORGEN was a revelation. Beautifully written, flawlessly acted, it cried out for more. How on earth could Season 2 be as good?

By not tampering with the formula, for one thing. Season 2 plunges the viewer into Birgitte Nyborgs term of office some time after Season 1 ended. Nothing else is altered. Crucially, the cast is the same. Complex relationships deepen, political intrigue heightens and through it all everything becomes even more interesting. The show is so beautifully plotted that even events such as negotiating peace within a warring African nation are entirely believable. And whats more, the viewer is made to really care about how these events affect the characters.

At the heart of it all, Sidse Babett Knudsen shines as Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg. Shes wonderful. But any show with a secret weapon like the one Ms Knudsen brings to the table cant help but succeed, especially when it is used sparingly and tastefully and always for maximum impact

And what might that secret weapon be? Her smile.

This is not just any smile, folks. Of course it helps that SBK is a beautiful woman (though not in a pin-up, look-at-me kind of way). There is a warmth, a glow to her smile that makes you want to smile back. With all the conflict and turmoil she faces in her professional and personal life, her smile has the effect of an oasis in a desert of challenges.

To harp yet further on this not-to-be-underestimated attribute, SBKs smile is made just one notch shy of nuclear-equivalent effulgence by one simple, little, totally natural quirk: The Crinkle.

The way SBKs nose crinkles up when she smiles is nothing short of mesmerizing. It is cute, tantalizing, sexy, vulnerable and fun all rolled into one. This exquisite physical characteristic is in the same league as Clint Eastwoods squint, Marilyn Monroes pout, Burt Lancasters smile or any other big stars magic something that captivates an audience. Its SBKs unique gift and it is no exaggeration to say that it is BORGENs secret weapon, for without a central protagonist who can stay accessible throughout the roller coaster ride that is the world of BORGEN, the shows credibility would begin to crack as it looks towards its third and final season.

Not so with The Crinkle unabashedly on display. It is as refreshing as a cold drink on a hot day. When Sidse crinkles, all is well. And as if to reinforce the effectiveness of this phenomenon, Season 2 ends with an extended, slow motion close-up of SBK smiling, in full crinkle mode. If that isn't proof of the considered application of BORGENs secret weapon, I don't know what is.

If there is a criticism to be made about the series, it is the recurring use of the F word, which in a show of such intelligence is simply unnecessary, if not tiresome. This lapse in judgement aside, BORGEN is magnificent.

Season 3, please. This show is as good as it gets.",1397433600,,2894,4.772
5580484,4,B00BD6M5ZS,"I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1397260800,2,2213,4.508728179551122

The idealism of Danish national identity is inspiring! The sacrifice of a leader's

personal and family living is saddening, but in a rich way. How rare for a powerful

figure of national influence to have a partner who can selflessly support the

principles of true progress being espoused by his or her significant other! The ambitions of

after having watched it, you feel that you've seen - and experienced - a work of art that is
sublimely special, one with a view of life, the world, interpersonal relations, gender and politics that
is extremely appealing and exquisitely presented. We can't recommend it highly enough and
certainly wish it the best in terms of attaining the same popularity in the United States that it has already
enjoyed in many countries. Hopefully its talented collaborators will work together again in the future and

Unfortunately Nybourg's is the only totally sympathetic part; the observer is left, sometimes fruitlessly, yearning for her success against an array of self-centered more or less jerks who are her friends, allies, and aides.  More than that, and contrary to adage, she has quite a collection of vicious enemies also.  Actually of course, it's a political soap opera; cf West Wing?  Must admit I'm hooked though, so BEWARE!

5580492,4,B00BD6M5ZS,"Riveting, is the word used for the first season of 'Borgen'. Season Two of 'Borgen' is just as riveting, only better,so much better. Sidse Babett Knudsen as the Prime Minister of Denmark has learned the tough lessons for a first term, now,she is tougher, better prepared and an about to be divorced woman. This second term is a tough year.

Nyborg has learned how to take power from a bunch of male politicians who refer to her as ""Mommy"" whenever she leaves the room. Nyborg, does a lot of brilliant things, and it seems she is at the top of her game. Nyborg and her husband have separated, her children feel alone, her daughter develops an anxiety that is difficult to control, and Nyborg has no one to talk to. Her close mentor had a stroke and she had to fire him. Her spin doctor, Kasper, played by Pilou Asbaek is meeting his devilish childhood head on, his off and on girlfriend, Katrine Fosmark, played by Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, moves from one job to another to find her ethical boundaries. Everyone seems to be in flux, everyone has an edge, everyone is trying to find themselves.

However, each episode finds that Nyborg is becoming stronger, more able to meet her detractors head on. She is still alone, her daughter in trouble, but things are about to come to a head. What we learn is that life is about compromise, political, personal, public and private. Nyborg blames herself for her daughter's problems, the marriage issues, and is now trying to look to the future to see what lays ahead. She has proved her mettle, and shown her colleagues that she is a true Prime Minister, in word and deed.

This is one of the best political series on either side of the big pond. It is a must see for everyone.

The Scandinavians manage to portray women in a way that Americans haven't been able to: as smart, sexy, powerful, and flawed, but not psychotic or ditzy. I'd heard so many good things about this series before I started watching it that I was sure I would be disappointed, but to my surprise it was even better than I could have anticipated.

There is also a small course in parliamentary democracies and how different they are to our own. Wonderful to see the nuances and the inevitable compromises inherent to coalition governments, in this case Denmark. An inevitable by-product of a parliamentary system with many parties where no single party can ever achieve a 51 percent vote. Therefore they are forced to bargain with other parties to achieve enough critical mass to govern. Absolutely fascinating and so different from our mainly 2 party system that seems to be alienating so many of us lately.

5580514,5,B00BD6M5ZS,"Note: This review contains spoilers.  I'm halfway through Season 2, watching on PBS, and I'm hooked. I find BORGEN the perfect balance of the interpersonal and the political, public and private.  I can't think of another show that more deftly illustrates the impact of political discourse on people's lives, and vice-versa, and it does so every week in a way that consistently delivers a POWERFUL punch both intellectually and emotionally.  The camerawork is phenomenal, so intimate, pulls you right in.  [UPDATE- the season got better and better, culminating with cliffhangers both personal and political, OUTSTANDING.]

I love the subtitles, obviously done by non-Native English speakers, e.g., ""Hey- those are just the perps that come with the job..."" [percs], ""you need the pressure of the right people"" [support], ""so"" substituted for ""but"", compassionate for sympathetic, etc., just slightly off, charming.  As with British shows (such as the Irish crime-drama SINGLE-HANDED, another new favorite, link below, available with Prime), Danish TV doesn't censor obscenities, interesting to hear four letter expletives in Danish.  It's often obvious what's being said from the inflection, even through they're blanked out in the subtitles for American TV.

Single-Handed- Season 1&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Justice/dp/B004RZV4PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Justice</a>

Another aspect I find intriguing is the depiction of government on a much smaller scale.  One soldier killed in Afghanistan produces a national outcry.  In one episode the prime minister's kids were upset with her for not cooking dinner.  Birgitte washes her own dishes, tries to unstop the kitchen sink, and cleans the house, but also flies to Africa to broker peace talks.

I have family in England, and BORGEN well illustrates the close ties and interdependency of EU nations and people, quite foreign (literally) to our insular way of thinking.  Similarly, American politics and the media are so polarized, polarizing, it's refreshing in the extreme to see a story that shows conflicting, and yet well-fleshed out, comprehensible points of view.  Everyone's human, fallible, sure, but it's not as simple as good guys vs. bad guys.  Not to go off on a tangent, but for example, animal-lovers in America often villainize hunters- yet I've read that hunters have done more to safeguard animal habitats and preserve more species than any other group in America (starting with Charles Audubon, an avid hunter).  BORGEN takes the time to paint people and issues in relatively fine brushstrokes.  I'm SO impressed, for example, with the thoughtful, sophisticated handling of mental illness, its very personal impact but also attendant issues, such as stressors, individualized treatment, the appropriateness of medication, etc.  Bringing Kasper's perspective in on it was a stroke of genius.

I find BORGEN captivating, fascinating on many levels.  I especially love the stories of the characters' personal lives- handled with such subtlety (as compared to The West Wing, for example, which I often found obvious and over-wrought).  I was quite overcome by the episode about childhood, barely saw it coming.  Director Sidney Lumet once said ""In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story.""  I puzzle over what that means, exactly, but by that definition I'd say BORGEN is both superb drama and superb melodrama, as the characters and the story so inform, so enrich each other, and seamlessly so.  The writing, the acting, the direction is as good as it gets, for me, just wonderful.  Highest recommendation.",1378080000,7,3722,5.554964539007092
