2752659,3,B000E7TA64,If you like 70s Kung Fu movies you will like this. 3 stars because it was poorly edited to a 4:3 aspect ratio.,1456617600,,110,3.8260869565217392
2752660,5,B000E7TA64,"Great Kung Fu movie. So far it's the best martial arts movie on Amazon. Excellent Mantis boxing and a cool story. I highly recommend this movie to martial arts movie fans. Lee Yi Min was awesome in it and as usual in the cool Kung Fu movies, has some cool training sequences.",1456012800,,275,4.3076923076923075
2752661,5,B000E7TA64,"This martial art movie is definitely a gem. Actually, I had this movie on VHS that I bought it back in 80s and still works well on my VCR, however, I wanted it on DVD for some obvious reason.  This movie is in par with Shaw Brothers "" The Venom"" series.
The plot is highly entertaining and the fights is fast and very well choreographed.
The actor Li I Min, like his counterparts in the Venom flicks, is very agile, fast, and acrobatic, and fights extremely good. The story is like most martial art movies  base upon ""revenge"" of some sort- in this case his father's. The rest you can guess.
The music score of this movie is one of the best score I have ever heard in any martial art movies - and believe you me I have hundred of them!!
This movie is a MUST for marital arts fans and I give this movie an easy 5 star.",1416441600,2,817,4.1
2752662,1,B000E7TA64,"Chang Yi here is so inexperienced, unpolished and unsophisticated in his early movie days as a martial arts expert. His image, frame, development and talent is so 'lukewarm' and bland. In this flick, the story content is very shallow and seem like nonsense, without proper development. The fight scenes and choreography is a -2, plus the guy fighting Chang Yi is stupid looking and untalented. I love Chang Yi, but not in this flick.  One can see he was still coming to form, but not quite fully developed in his craft like he's been in later flicks like Shaolin Traitors, Shaolin Mystagogue and so on...!  Such a pity though, 'cause he's great to watch, but not here...!",1179273600,,671,4.726495726495727
2752663,5,B000E7TA64,"Another decent release from the Eastern Heros collection,,,this flick is certainly a BEST KEPT SECRET! I though the 7 commandment of Kung Fu is one of the most impressive flicks using the mantis fist. Definately one of of Li Min ( Mystery Of Chess Boxing,,Drunking Arts and Crippled Fist, 7 Grandmasters ,World of Drunken Master! This guy is equally surperb in this one,,,,,,,,,,be assured you 're in for a treat!!",1151712000,3,414,4.928571428571429

8173965,4,B000E7TA64,"Very good movie, story line, and fight scenes; glad I decided to watch it. If you love 70's style Kung-Fu movies you should enjoy this one.",1457913600,,139,4.384615384615385
8173966,1,B000E7TA64,"This movie had no story.  A guy all dressed in white comes into town only to be chased by a bunch of bad guys.  There is no explanation of who this guy is supposed to be.  Along the way, he is helped by a young man who was training martial arts with his uncle, but the uncle gets killed and the guy in white becomes his master.  In the end, the young man finds out that his master is someone from his past.  If you are watching just to watch the kung-fu, then you might like this movie, but if you are looking for a story, you won't find one here.",1457481600,,547,3.891891891891892
