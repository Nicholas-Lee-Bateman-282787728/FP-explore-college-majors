8078913,5,B000AMPK4E,"Having known Harry James since 1963, it was a privilege to call him ""friend.""  The movie, ""Private Buckaroo"" is a must for swing music fans.  Harry is terrific in this trumpet spoof.",1413244800,,182,4.65625

8078917,5,B000AMPK4E,"The item arrived on time and  in good condition. Though created as propaganda, Private Buckaroo is very enjoyable and takes me back to my youth in the 50s, when such movies were regular fare on TV. My 9 year-old daughter loves it and watches it frequently, mainly to see the Andrews Sisters perform, which is why I bought it in the first place. Stage Door Canteen has its moments, too.",1334534400,,385,4.5
