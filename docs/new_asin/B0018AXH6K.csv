8269043,5,B0018AXH6K,"Why be disease-ridden when you can be healthy? With 37 testimonials appearing one after the other like a fireworks display, it's hard to not to ask yourself this question. Glowing people who were themselves once plagued with illness tell their phenomenal stories of healing. At about an hour, this DVD is the perfect length to inspire friends and family to try a raw food diet.

Valya Boutenko's beautiful introduction tells us, health is a natural result of a body that is well nourished by fresh fruits, greens, nuts and seeds- a diet of 100% raw and living foods! Valya traveled all around the country to make this motivational film. She interviewed people who changed their eating habits to successfully heal painful and life-threatening conditions such as cancer, diabetes, eczema, psoriasis, moles/ warts, acid reflux, ADHD, allergies, heart disease, hernias, anemia, arthritis, asthma, sinus problems, obesity, osteoporosis, weak bones, hormone imbalances, injuries, ITP, MS, even seizures, and a case of fibromyalgia which healed in 4 days!!! Anyone with these health issues will be amazed and inspired, if they are not skeptical of the claims. Anyone in the raw foods community would tell you more research needs to be done. Raw foodists are pioneers, often navigating alone in this challenging new land. We are offering the mainstream world the message of our own positive experiences, which certainly deserve to be studied by the world's top scientists.

Yes I recommend it! I want everyone I know to watch this video!",1210032000,19,1529,5.186234817813765
