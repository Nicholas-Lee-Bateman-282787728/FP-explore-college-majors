A WOMAN AT HER WINDOW might be dismissed as a period piece, but are we prepared to dismiss that period? Perhaps we should if we can only conceive of it as the resolution of the three-way face-off among or between Stalinism, Nazism-fascism, and capitalist democracy. The two former must be dismissed. Yet too many nasty accusations against the latter cannot be: capitalist-imperialism (as for us has been elaborated by such historians as William Appleman Williams and Walter Lafeber), the state's domination by predatory capitalist oligarchies, vulgar commercialism at the expense of culture and now others that apply to ALL forms of materialist civilization: the criminal use of science and technology by secretive, bureaucratic, often conspiratorial elites; runaway technology; and a deteriorating environment.

We are now reduced to the role of spectators of our own demise. In A WOMAN AT HER WINDOW set in Greece in 1936, just as the British-backed General Metaxis has seized power to establish what the historian A.D. Harvey describes as a pro-British fascism, we see people who, with whatever futility, whatever fatalism, will submit to no such role: The Greek Communist, Boutros and his lover, Margot Santorini, the aristocratic wife of an Italian diplomat. But it's also concerns two, magnanimous, broad-minded figures of the old order: the men she's leaving, her husband and his friend, a French capitalist, both who in their different ways love her enough to risk all that they have, even their lives, to help her take a course of action that they loathe.

Romanticism? I'll say! It's nice to see a leftist like the screenplay writer,Jorge Semprun, expelled from the Spanish Communist Party in 1965,after having spent the war as a fighter in the French Underground, then as an inmate of Buchenwald, gladly concede the humanity of his old enemies, whom, if he ever hated them, certainly learned to love the best of them.. But he and his collaborator, Grenier-Deferre, the elder, go further: They are making a left-wing adolescent fantasy out of a book written by an anti-Semitic fascist writer, Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who at the time of the Normandy invasion had been disillusioned with Hitler's New Order for about a year (according to Wickipedia), but was still serving Vichy. The writer appears as a character in the movie in the spring of 1945, a friend of the Italian and the Frenchman (both anti-fascists), ironically, because the viewer can't know that he was about to commit suicide. He explains his own rejection of Communism: for the wrong reasons. (His secret diary shows that by the end of his life, he had become a secret Stalinist.)

Why bother with all of this? There is an air of silly adolescent romanticism that the movie acknowledges: The Communist, Boutros teases Margot Santorini, ""This is like the movies."" -- an echo of what the Cambridge Soviet spy, Anthony Blunt, said upon his arrest,""It was all cops and robbers!"" What of it? We older people are supposed to be able to enjoy the sight of younger people doing what we used to do. The French USED to say,""If you are not a socialist when you are young, you have no heart. If you are a socialist when you are old, you have no head."" The underlying assumption is that the status quo is enduring enough to make that a recurring verity. It is no longer. Is the viewer ready for a maturity that accepts as likely the demise of materialist civilization and its most noble and hopeful philosophical traditions? This viewer believes he is, but now and again, I need to look back upon a time when this civilization -- and I -- were young and prepared to hope and fight. A WOMAN AT HER WINDOW is a window on that time.",1394064000,,3745,4.8929133858267715
