8136862,5,B000H5U800,"This two sided DVD with both Hawaii and Californian Zen is a great bargain with double the amount of soothing video for the regular price of one DVD.

The producer/distributor has indeed improved this series by removing all promotional audio.  All you get is the soothing sound of the waves, wind and birds.

I'm not sure if there's really that much difference between Hawaii Zen and Hawaii Waves.  Both seemed to have great visual imagery.  Check the links provided by the distributor to see which one you'll prefer.

The only lacking footage on Hawaii Zen is the first ""day"" which shows a placid waterfront with rather boring greenery and rocks.  It's really lacking in color and beauty and it's puzzling why they included it when the other ""days"" are clearly much better in quality.  Other than that, however, no complaints.  (Again, see links and promo photos provided by the DVD distributor to see what I mean.)

I purchased this from the distributor (listed on the ""Used/Like New"" listing page) instead of Amazon and they were super fast with the delivery and their price was a little bit cheaper.  Would probably buy from them again.",1167782400,7,1140,4.824742268041237
