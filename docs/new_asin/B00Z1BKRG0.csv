7270315,4,B00Z1BKRG0,"The film is what one would expect if you have seen the other features, although that isn't necessary to understand the plot. Robert Englund  and Yancy Butler have survived the last feature to be in this one, in fact Yancy Butler was in at least the last two of these. It smartly combines this series with the last Anaconda film where they look for the Blood Orchid for an immortality serum which involves our genetically altered anaconda who needed genes from the croc. Sarah Murdoch (Annabel Wright) is the daughter of Murdoch (John Rhys-Davies) of the Anaconda series.

There is no Lake Placid in this film. It is Black Lake and Clear Lake and it is filmed in Bulgaria so go figure.  So we have mega crocs and mega anacondas on the lake as police are out to kill them, a private corporation is out to extract them, and Delta Phi Beta sorority is holding initiations in bikinis, tops optional.

One great sex scene.  3 1/2 stars for the cheese.",1438387200,9,945,4.535294117647059
7270316,5,B00Z1BKRG0,It will be enjoyable a battle between two Predators and it is like the others except it has a Croc. and Snake fighting each other that is the only difference with the other movies.,1435708800,4,180,4.323529411764706
7270317,3,B00Z1BKRG0,"This is exactly what u expect to see.
 it belong to the horror sub-genre a monster vs another monster like freddy vs jason.....etc.....etc....
 this time we get a giant crocodile against a giant anaconda and the result is hilarius.
 this has nothing to do with the original lake placid and anaconda series as it's really a stand alone film.
 the usual problem is this flick is a direct to video so don't expect great cgi and also don't expect great plot and acting....LOL
 BUT u get a great as always freddy = robert englund and a bunch of nice fights between the two monsters and people get in the mix and between the fight so the cheesy fun u want is a guarrantee but that's that.
 if u are in to these films then add this to your collection.

7270338,5,B00Z1BKRG0,"Given a recent news article that someone has actually released a giant Anaconda in Maine (I kid you not) this movie is fiction turned to life:  [...] Also we need to keep Robert Englund employed now that the Freddy franchise has died.  It may be a bit of a spoiler, but I must admit this movie has some of the finest depictions of exploding crocodiles ever put on film, which is why I give it 5 stars.  Another great movie to play at a party (since the plot is non-essential) right up there with ""The Marine""",1473206400,,508,4.270833333333333

7270348,1,B00Z1BKRG0,You know your movie is in deep trouble when your monsters are better looking then Yancy Butler.

7270368,5,B00Z1BKRG0,"Apparently, when they clearly state that something is ""The Final Chapter,"" they don't really mean it because here we have a new chapter that ends with a setup for another chapter.  Same cartoon crocs with the new twist being the addition of cartoon anacondas.  The animators didn't try all that hard to make these fake cartoony critters exist in the phony reality of film.  I could have done better with sock puppets.  The same holds true for most of the actors, especially Nigel Barber as the psychotic mayor and Annabel Wright as Sarah Murdoch the psychotic heiress out to collect her experiment.  It fell to Corin Nemec, Yancy Butler, and Robert Englund to make it work..........or thereabouts.  The plot involves the usual mayhem, dopey people gathered in the wrong place at the wrong time and falling victim to the healthy appetites of the crocs.  Breasts are flashed, silly dialog is uttered with no amount of credibility, things get crushed or eaten; just what you would expect from this franchise.  The entire movie is populated by morons doing everything possible to be eaten by the cartoon crocs.

Needless to say, I loved it.  I am looking forward to the next installment (because why give up now?  They surely can't get any worse).  Now they just have to figure out how to introduce sharks into the next movie.  Or man eating giraffes (no one has ever made a movie about killer giraffes.  Be daring, start a new trend).  Just saying........",1441324800,14,1452,4.798387096774194

7270373,3,B00Z1BKRG0,"These movies by this point are made for a pocket of fans devoted to the B movie monster genre. In that respect this fulfilled some of those fans of cheesy horror, poorly cgi rendered monsters and one dimensional characters. Robert Englund knocked it out of the park. I think he knew exactly what was expected of him in this and it was nice to see some other returning cast for this as well as plot lines such as the blood orchid from previous anaconda films. Sadly the title is not fulfilled. There's about two fights between crocodile and anaconda and one ends in about 15 seconds max. I'm sure there will be a part two so I'm hoping there's an improvement on that. In any case if you got $12 bucks, why not!",1439596800,,709,4.338345864661654

7270375,3,B00Z1BKRG0,"Wanted it to be so bad it was good but was bitterly disappointed. The dubbing of the Eastern European cast members is as mismatched as the Godzilla flicks of the 60's. Guilty of owning all 5 but a true fan of the original. This script, its direction and performances come across like the work of 8th graders. Like a train wreck it's hard to look away.",1438992000,,351,4.333333333333333
7270376,4,B00Z1BKRG0,"Not Golden Globe or Oscar material but it was definitely entertaining. Some of the acting was unrealistic; example some of the characters were way to calm when the crocodile and anaconda got close to them instead of freaking out like a normal person would do, otherwise good entertaining movie.",1438905600,,294,5.020408163265306
