8184753,4,B000OCZ2P2,"My daughter loves hello kitty & specifically asked for a hello kitty movie for her birthday. After reading tons of reviews I decided stump village was the way to go. This particular volume isint scary or violent like some of the other ones I read reviews on. There isint really anything educational about the movie, but you can rest knowing its not going to make your child cry either. My kids love it, so I'm happy.",1378166400,,416,4.4868421052631575

8184756,2,B000OCZ2P2,My kids love Helllo Kitty. I bought this video thinking the kids would LOVE it! And I was right! They absolutely loved it. The theme song is catchy to say the least and the clay characters are very captivating to the kids. The only problem I have was the content. They are showing the characters being mean to each other and crying and being grumpy but then never coming to a resolution. The stories end with me wondering what happened next?! The behavior modeled would have been fine if there was a proper response to the bad behavior modeled as well. All in all..fun to watch but low quality content/storyline.,1359504000,,612,4.572727272727272
8184757,5,B000OCZ2P2,"My 4 year old loves Hello Kitty.  I had never seen any of the Stump Village videos before buying this one.  This video is narrated, so the characters do not actually speak.  There are only four episodes on this video, so compared to most other videos - that may seem a little short. However, the episodes are fun and light.  The characters are all shown working together to resolve issues.",1262649600,6,389,4.514285714285714
