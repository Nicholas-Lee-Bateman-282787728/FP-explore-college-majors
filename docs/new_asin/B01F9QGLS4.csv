8760541,1,B01F9QGLS4,"Bought the second season for my wife's Birthday. She puts it in the DVD player, clicks play and you get nothing but a black screen and just audio. Very disappointed. Now she's gotta wait another week for the replacement, and hopefully this one actually works.....

8760543,1,B01F9QGLS4,"I bought season 1 and season 2 of Finding Carter back in September and season 1 was amazing. However, today I finally opened season 2 and popped it in the dvd player all excitedly and I hit episodes, clicked on the episode I wanted to watch and nothing played. I tried this with most of the season 2 discs and still nothing played. I know it's not my dvd player because I just watched a dvd last night so the only sound explanation is that the discs are no good.",1478995200,2,462,4.144444444444445

8760547,5,B01F9QGLS4,"I love this show and I think it should be sold in stores. I don't understand why Awkward is sold in stores but finding Carter is not. Finding Carter is a way better show than Awkward.
