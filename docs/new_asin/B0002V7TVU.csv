Except here, even though there are two guys, they're not wild and crazy. In fact, they're the opposite--very cautious and meek, but very creative. They're two very talented radio show writer-performers who've developed a group of characters for their ongoing show that take us through the film as the two radio guys live their lives through these characters--and two of them with a lot of airtime are women, but obviously men playing women. So are these guys gay? Nope. They're just doing their characters.

A hottie secretary to their boss shows up and their imaginations run wild, which again shows up in the story they tell, the meat of the entire film. At the end when the show's characters appear to move out of the show and into real life, it's done so gently and sweetly that it's just a lot of fun.

A fun film, fun to watch. Nice job.",1144713600,9,1130,4.529411764705882
8032679,1,B0002V7TVU,"Coming from the former USSR, I was curious to see this movie, but I have to say that I was quite dissapointed. It was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Cheap looking sets, characters one does not care about, annoing music behind the camera, lack of plot... It's as if the movie was trying to determine my tolerance level. The quility of this DVD seems to match the quality of the movie. There is not even a scene selection available! Don't waste your time and find something better to do!",1105747200,2,503,4.361702127659575
8032680,5,B0002V7TVU,"OK, I may be biased here as I'm an Estonian myself, but having watched this movie some 10-15 times, well, that should say it all.  It's not the ""slap-in-your-face"" type comedy that's coming out plentifully from Hollywood, but rather subtle ""tongue-in-cheek"" type, where you have to read between the lines.  And by watching it a few times over, you'll start realizing details that you didn't notice before.",1101427200,19,405,5.029850746268656
