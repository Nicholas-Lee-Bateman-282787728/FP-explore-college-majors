8403539,5,B003RCJR84,"This film was totally what I expected to see. It's indie and doesn't try to be Hollywood garbage. It also isn't cliche at all - I'm so sick of every indie film saying, ""Look! We're real people taping something with a camcorder"". It looks indie because it is, and it doesn't apologize for that.
I thought the 60s drive-in style was fun. I had a great time watching it and I can see it becoming a cult hit...for indie enthusiasts...you know, people who actually enjoy film and don't want the same old thing all the time.
Was it terrifying? Not really...but it was original and it was campy and it was different. I also want to see the films shown in the trailers...those look hilarious!",1287014400,2,684,4.48
8403540,1,B003RCJR84,"The Clearing 2010/I is about as interesting as an above average home movie, which now that I think about it, is what it is. Any movie involving one person as the producer, writer, director and one of the characters is suspect. Everything done by Martin Abankwa should be seen in the same light. Unfortunately, some things in life cannot be un-seen, so take my word and save yourselves. The only suspense about The Clearing is why anyone would pay to see it in the first place. I want my money back and I saw it for free.

There are people who collect really bad Indy films for a laugh; for these consumers, this is a must-have.",1281484800,3,627,4.405172413793103
