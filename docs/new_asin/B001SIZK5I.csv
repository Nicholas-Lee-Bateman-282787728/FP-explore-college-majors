Something contradicting this agenda, has no chance of being published in the west. So in this movie we can take a glimpse at the ""hippster period"" how it was. I can only speak for east germany, where people experienced this period, pretty much just like it. I loved the muscic growing up in the 50's to the early 60's, and I really loved to see the girls in those pretty and very sexy dresses. I remember, that almost all girls dressed in the wonderful petticoat fashion, and looked beautiful, compeating with fluffyness.
I fondly remember the spontaneous beachparties, with the crankable recordplayers and barn parties where we kids where not allowed to go to, but we got secretly up and watched through the cracks, and getting into trouble.
The film portray's a conflict between the socialist goverment and the hippsters, that perhaps is a little bit exagerated, since I had the feeling, that it was more of a generational conflict.",1354233600,,1074,4.779569892473118
8339874,5,B001SIZK5I,"Although this movie is in the Russian language and does not have subtitles it can certainly be enjoyed by English speakers. The story is about Soviet youths known as stilyagi who enjoyed listening to and dancing to Western jazzy dance music. This story takes place in 1955 and 1956. The themes are so universal (horrified parents, inventive ways to break the rules, teen love and rejection, etc. ) that one can follow and enjoy the story even without understanding Russian.

The film is a musical and the music is high energy, fun and excellent. The story is engaging as we follow one young man who goes from being a committed communist youth to becoming a ""deviant"" westernized youth. The acting is suburb and Oksana Akinshina never looked better. The color in the film is bright and contrasts our teenage friends who are dressed in crazy outfits and wild colors with the deary communist city of Moscow and it's inhabitants who are portrayed in grays and dark colors. This film takes you away to another place and time and even though it's over two hours long you don't get tired of it and wish for it to continue. By the way the ending is amazing!

This film provides an insightful look into the Soviet culture of the times. If you know of and understand these times it's even better. The Komsomol, the shops where the choices are limited, black marketeers, records made on X-rays, and even the little details like the shortwave radio with the city names on the dial make this a movie you can watch over and over again.

My wife does not speak Russian and has no knowledge of the Soviet state and generally ignores my Russian movies, especially those without subtitles. But, she watched this entire movie start to finish, loved it and talked about it for several days.",1327536000,2,1770,4.666666666666667
8339875,4,B001SIZK5I,"Fun Russian musical about kids who rebel by adopting what they think is a hip American lifestyle of jazz and dancing and loud colorful clothing. One of their persecutors enters the fold, another leaves. Discoveries are made, songs are sung (though not as many as you might expect), lives change.",1321660800,,295,4.92
8339876,5,B001SIZK5I,"I just saw this at the Cleveland International Film Festival and absolutely loved everything about it.  I do not speak Russian, so obviously the subtitles were a great help to me, but it's hardly the movie's fault that somebody bought the wrong version off of the internet.  Anyway, I thought the acting was great, the story was very interesting (especially for someone who did not grow up or have much familial experience with Communist Russia), and it was an all-around wonderful movie to see.  I look forward to purchasing the film when it comes out with the English subtitles.  Hipsters/Boogie Bones/Stilyagi is definitely a must see!",1269820800,5,638,4.990566037735849
8339877,2,B001SIZK5I,"I saw this movie at the Anchorage International film Festival just before Christmas and was thrilled. A friend commented by calling it ""East Side Story"", which is probably the most succinct description I've heard. Set in Moscow in 1955, it is a semi-musical love story which takes place amid the underground music scene suffering Soviet communist oppression. Great music, singing and dancing, well worth searching out on the big screen. I ordered the DVD from Amazon and the only disappointment was no english subtitles (which the movie in Anchorage had).",1262131200,,555,5.177777777777778
