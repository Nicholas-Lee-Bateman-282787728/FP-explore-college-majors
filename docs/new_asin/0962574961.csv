8340394,2,0962574961,"I recently purchased this video because I am teaching self-defense classes for senior citizens, and always welcome new and useful information. Considering that this video is one of the only ones I could find in any format that says it was designed for seniors, I thought there might be something I could find and use.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.
Now, I will admit that the instructor does a good job of explaining the techniques he is teaching, demonstrating it at different speeds and angles, and then providing time for those at home to practice each technique on their own with a partner. Additionally, I did find that most of the self-defense techniques against chokes, grabs, bear hugs, headlocks and the ground defenses were pretty basic and should be fairly effective for many people.  However, that is where my praise ends and my multitude of criticisms begin.
He states throughout that the main objective of his techniques is to allow you to escape, but the problem is that while he shows people how to escape from some basic attacks, he fails to do any significant damage to the attacker.  In most scenarios he is content to never strike the attacker, while occasionally talking about hyper-extending an arm or the fingers. He does mention doing some additional strikes during the front bear hug section, but that fails to address all of the early scenarios he has already presented.
The fact is that if you manage to escape the grab or choke of someone attacking you without doing any, or minimal damage to that person, the attacker will simply re-engage and the fight is on again, only this time the attacker will likely be even more savage.  Any good self-defense instructor should advise students to use force only as needed, but here he fails to advise the student that once you remove a choke, for example, the attacker is uninjured and will likely continue the attack - so what should the student do then?  No advice or comment is made about this, making it seem that once the initial attack is thwarted, you will easily be able to escape. There is no real discussion about punches, palm heels, elbow strikes, shin kicks, eye gouging, weapons that anyone, particularly a senior citizen should know how to do. This is a serious omission in my opinion.
If that isn't bad enough, things get steadily worse.  The instructor claims that this is designed for seniors, yet he consistently teaches various arm locks, something most people will have trouble learning without hundreds of hours of practice.  Further, doing any lock or arm bar is certainly much easier when your opponent never resists - which is exactly what the attacker does in this video - essentially nothing.  His chokes look like he is giving a massage, and he never offers any resistance, making it look like these techniques will be easy to pull off, when nothing could be further from the truth.
Finally, what bothers me most of all are the knife defenses he demonstrates.  Once again, while he professes that this video is to show you how to escape, he instead teaches the students to essentially get locked in a struggle with a knife wielding opponent, which will likely result in their being seriously injured or killed.  Having studied several martial arts for over 20 years, I am still working on knife defenses, none of which I would expect anyone to ever pick up from watching a video presentation.  Worse still, if people watch and then try to imitate on the street what this instructor is teaching, I have no doubt they would be killed.  Most of his blocks would telegraph movement causing the attacker to strike, while the complex movements he shows for trying to hold the knife arm and then disarm the weapon will simply put the defender in a better position for the attacker to repeatedly stab and cut them.
And worse still, after showing all of that, he then suggests that senior citizens should learn to kick an attacker's knife arm to ...I don't know what, hope they drop the knife if you get lucky enough to even make contact with the arm? Only a person with years of kicking moving targets, and then only ones with excellent speed and power, should even attempt to defend him or herself against a knife by using kicks, since anyone else will likely get their legs sliced in the process, making it impossible for them to even run away.  I could not believe that he even suggested it, since no rational thinking instructor would do so, especially when your target students are generally going to be over the age of 55, with slower reflexes and less flexibility, and many with more serious mobility issues.
So, if you are a senior citizen and are thinking of buying this video to learning some useful self-defense techniques, I would say that there is material that you can practice and use against unarmed attackers, but keep in mind it is limited in its scope, and that the knife defenses should be avoided at all costs. You would do better to watch a krav maga or kapap DVD on knife defenses, which will likely teach you more useful and less dangerous techniques, although even some of those would still need to be modified for those with mobility issues.",1352764800,2,5155,4.73355629877369
