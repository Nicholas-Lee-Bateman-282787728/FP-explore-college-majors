1460157,5,B00005JLR5,"Egoyan has done it again!!! Staying true to himself Egoyan again pulls off what others simply see as not doable, and he achieves it in ARARAT with the precision we are so used to seeing in his films and with such mastery that one just wishes he made the film. An excellent script, excellent actors and acting, ARARAT is a paradigm of storytelling, potent to stimulate thought (and action), and convey both grief over loss suffered in the past and anger over denial being experienced in the contemporary period. Egoyan again stresses the importance if not sacredness of memory and remembrance especially of events that either are tragic or breed tragedy like the Genocide of the Armenians. The stories need to be told and through that the loss and grief should be comitted to remembrance. Egoyan once again proves capable of doing just that. Job well done Atom!!!",1034640000,18,862,4.831081081081081
1460158,4,B00005JLR5,"No doubt sad but true, the story the production acting was little poor but who am I to judge.
My comment is that: I saw the film in Paris while I was on
vacation, all my relatives were waiting unpatiently for the release where I never heard about it in the US consedering there is a great number of Armenians and being borders with Canada.
My wish is after putting all that effort to make such a great
piece of work, advertise it, market it, let it be heard.
Hope to see it soon in theaters in US especialy in California.
Even in limitted areas, I am not criticising but wishing
successful start, so there will more masterpieces to follow.
after all everything cost money, but not to forget if you wanna be heard must be on the big screen and media.
Thanks! Keep up the good work",1032134400,11,779,4.27027027027027

1460252,3,B00005JLR5,"I thought this was a very good movie. Before this movie I had never heard of the Armenian Genocide. In the beginning of the movie I was very confused. I was actually confused throughout the entire movie until the very end. It was organized oddly with both flashbacks and flash forwards. I found it interesting that the main character allowed himself to believe the people who let him shoot footage. Why wouldn't he had just gotten rid of the containers of film before trying to board the plane? I did not understand how he could be so naive. The one scene with the two brothers stood out to me especially. I could not watch because the screams from the one brother being tortured really effected me. Imagine sitting there as a child getting yelled at by the Turkish leader as your brother was being tortured in the other room. Something else that stood out to me in this movie was whether or not the main character's father actually died as a hero. I understood that he was upset about what had happened, but how do we know that he did not go out on the battle field because he wanted to die? Maybe he died fighting, but maybe he went out there because he wanted to die. The movie intrigued me and really makes me want to learn more about the Armenian genocide. The scene with the half Turkish actor and the main character stands out to me as well. It is insane to think that to this day in age people still do not believe that the Armenian genocide occurred. It was interesting that he bought the Turkish actor a bottle of champagne. This showed that the Armenian director wanted to prove that regardless of the things that have happened, the Armenian's were still the better people. Regardless of what the people from Turkey did to the Armenian's, he still bought him a bottle of champagne to make it seem like there were no hard feelings (even though there is).",1393891200,,1864,4.469208211143695

2.  With the above being said, this is simply a completely boring movie.  Furthermore, the acting is lame (stiff and unnatural), the characters are just too... too disjointed in regards to the story as a whole and the writing;  man the writing is just completely boring.  Thus, please avoid this dud and for those who want to enlighten the world in regards to Armenian history, please find someone who can actually create a worthwhile movie.",1341705600,2,655,4.508474576271187
1460255,5,B00005JLR5,"This film is one that I approached viewing, after holding out for an edition with the bonus features that the supplementary second DVD of this one includes, with great expectation and even trepidation. After viewing ""Ararat"", with and without Atom Egoyan`s commentary on the movie itself and on the deleted scenes (as well as all of the many other bonus features), it left me even more profoundly moved even than I had expected to feel. I won`t write any extended review. The film is wonderfully rich and layered, with several strands of narrative weaving in and out along with many different perspectives on the part of the various characters in the movie. It takes careful viewing to appreciate how much this variety contributes to the film`s greatness and profundity, something that negative critics who find it confusing do not appreciate.

The Armenian genocide is a delicate issue. I long have been involved with it through my interactions, here in Canada as well as in Turkish Kurdistan itself (where I made an humanitarian mission under joint Kurdish patriotic and U.S./Canadian Independent Lutheran auspices) in very intense involvement with the Kurds of Turkish occupied Kurdistan, a people who shared the ancestral lands which they inhabited along with the Armenian people. The tribe of two interrelated and intermarried Kurdish families with whose members I undertook most of the mission, in the greater Diyarbakir area (after two days with the Kurdish community of Istanbul outside of Kurdistan but within Turkey) included numerous Kurds of partial Armenian ancestry, although they all had become Muslim over the years since the time of the Armenian troubles prior to and during W.W. I.

I was privileged to share the memories, passed on from one generation of them to the next, of how the Armenian genocide took place, not in this case in Van of the film`s setting, but in the Diyarbakir region, where other horrendous atrocities took place that have yet to be documented satisfactorily. The Turks had abused Kurds and Armenians alike over those long years, though at the time of the Armenian genocide the Kurds had been tricked into collaborating with the Turks, who turned on the Kurds once their cynical plans had been carried out, to the shame of the Kurds, who honestly repented of what they had done, and who since have acted in great solidarity (along with Greeks) of the cause of the Armenians who wish to expose and publicise the infamies of the ""Young Turks"" who overthrew the relatively tolerant Ottoman regime to establish a virulent Turkish racial and nationalist exclusivism that only tolerates Kurds, Greeks, Armenians, and other non-ethnic Turks if they assimilate.

One of the most searing memories of the mission was standing at the top of an ancient ziggurat, from the heights of which my Kurdish hosts pointed out to me the path along which the Armenians were lined up from their own Kurdish village (one of the terminal points of this particular and spectacular massacre), single file, right to the city of Diyarbakir itself and gunned down or otherwise butchered for miles of corpses on end. Another memory was of seeing, elsewhere within the province of Diyarbakir, the ruins (only its foundation left) of the Armenian Orthodox Church in the Kurdish town and venerable Christian and Muslim holy site of Egil, on one of the steep slopes of this town which straddles two facing mountainsides. There I learned from eye-witnesses of this church`s destruction in the 1960s, decades after the famous Armenian attrocities, but years during which the Turks continued to destroy the antiquties of and Armenians and Kurds alike.  The antiquities in Egil, however, are not so arrestingly striking to the eyes as those in Van, which ""Ararat"", the film and the special features, shows in all of their delapidated, hauntingly strange splendour.

I appreciate both Atom Egoyan's passion for his subject, in ""Ararat"", as well as his admission of some extenuating circumstances that help to soften the culpability of the Turks' cruel and rapacious behaviour at the time of W.W. I and later. The Armenians, to at least some extent, were aiding and abetting the Russian foes of the Ottoman Empire/burgeoning Republic of Turkey. However, the sheer brutality of the massacre of Armenian in Van and Diyarbakir, as the film shows the former, were inexcusable and utterly barbaric, way out of proportion to any just and limited retribution for some Armenians' collusion with the Russian Tsar's empire. Just how barbaric those purges were the film shows in terrifying vividness, as well as the impact of all this upon later generations of Armenians who have had to come to terms with such an heritage of suffering and loss.",1323043200,,4735,5.057618437900128

1460299,3,B00005JLR5,"The only reason I am giving this three stars and not one is that this is the only story-form account of the Armenian genocide that is not a documentary. That alone is a reason to watch it. Otherwise the self-indulgent, confusing plot will give you whiplash, and in my opinion takes away from the story instead of adding to it. It is like trying to have a conversation with someone on speed.
  The first 15 minutes play out like an art film, leaving you aching to turn off the remote. I did wait it out, though, and found that despite the dizzying ungratifying twists and dull turns of plot, it was worth watching. Watching,not buying.
  Some of the plot lines he could have done without entirely. As a matter of fact if he had just stuck with the focus on Arsinee' ( who did a great job), and her father, the movie would have actually been good. Maybe even great.
  For what it is worth, I am Armenian, and I have a personal connection to this atrocity just like any other Armenian who bears this legacy of pain.
I wish I wish I wish, when the whole world was watching just for a moment, that he would have gotten out of his head ( and maybe ego) ,and stuck with a simple plot line that would have shown the Armenian genocide for what it really was. An atrocity that has left it's mark on generations and generations to come.",1241136000,2,1325,4.301204819277109
1460300,4,B00005JLR5,"I recently saw this film and found it intriging.  The film is very disturbing as the genocide itsself is hardly ever addressed in film or books.

When I was in school, there was never any education on this and it seems to remain buried even today.

This film addresses the genocide in a very real way and should be seen by everyone.

I noticed, as a Charles Aznavour fan, that the name of his character, Edward Saroyen, was the name of the same charactor he played in ""Shoot the Piano Player.""  I had hoped that it would be explained, as it would be interesting to know how the piano player became a movie director.

1460301,4,B00005JLR5,"I wasn't sure what this movie was about until I watched it.  Let me warn you, this movie is slow to start, and has a rather strange beginning (brother & sister sleeping together).  Be patient, it gets better about 20 minutes into the movie.  It also jumps around a bit from storyline to storyline. However, we enjoyed the movie in the end.

Another shortcoming; the movie tries to depict the brutality of the Armenian Holocaust, but does a rather poor job of this.  Being Armenian, I sometimes heard my grandmother talk about her escape from Armenia (at the age of 14) during the holocaust.  The movie may show mass murder, rape, and violence by the Turks against the Armenians; but the brutality is lacking compared to what actually happened.  Enough said.

1460302,5,B00005JLR5,"First, thank you 2007-2008 Men's World Figure Skating Champion Jeffrey Buttle for skating to the score of Ararat this recently completed skating season.

This was the only Egoyan film I had not yet watched, for several reasons, but when I watched one of your first Grand Prix skating long programmes this past season, I was so enthralled by the score, I considered watching the film. After your breathtaking Worlds programme, I was finally inspired to watch the film, and purchased it.

This film would have been more effective if the director presented the Armenian sequences as genuinely crafted extensive historical flashbacks (to show the extent of the massacres) with enhanced context and cinematography and acting performances, and provided more cohesive continuity, instead of using clich&eacute;d soundstage re-enactments discordantly interpolated throughout the underdeveloped and choppy present-day plotline.

I understand that Egoyan was trying to use an innovative method to capture and maintain the audience's attention - threading together a summarized record of the history of the Armenians and their massacre with poignant depictions of present-day ""diaspora"" Armenians in Canada struggling with identity, cultural, and ethnic crises, but, because of the gravity of the topic, he should have scaled back the innovation and instead focused on cinematically illustrating in enhanced historical detail Armenian history and the massacre, and broadened the overall acting performances by providing depth to the characters.

What Egoyan does demonstrate, either intentionally or intentionally, is that the self-victimization of the Armenian characters, and their explicit, unhindered, relentless focus on the Armenian massacre, impeded their ability to not only understand each other and their own individual crises, but their ability to reconcile with each other to preserve and defend and promote their culture and language (which they did retain) and traditions and history, to preserve and defend and promote their national identity and roots.

The Armenian characters, not even the mom and Saroyan the film director, did not realize their acculturation to the country they were living in (which happened to be Canada) dramatically minimized and virtually muted their ethnic connection to Turkey/Armenia.

They were so intent on trying to publically prove the specific event of the massacre - which they failed to do because Egoyan only presented one instance of killings that occurred during the siege of the city of Van - that they forgot about presenting Armenia's historology and culture and achievements, and, when Elias Koteas tried to discuss the historical context of the massacre, and Saroyan immediately dismissed him, Saroyan's reaction and unjustified explanation for the reaction negated the gravity and credibility of the massacre itself, and discredited the overall self-victimization of the Armenian characters.

We have a group of people who were massively decimated, and that type of mass carnage is obviously horrific, but what must we automatically sympathize with the descendants of the massacred ancestors who were born and raised in a completey different geopolitical location? What if the ancestors were ""illegally occupying"" Turkey? What if they were an indigenous group of people with draconian traditions whom were actively revolting against the Turkish powers? What if they were the progenitors of Turks and the first occupants of the land who had been systematically killed because they refused assimilation? And for those of us already familiar with Armenian history, what if the armed Armenian nationalist groups (Hunchaks, Dashnaks, etc) and the Armenian populace were plotting to join forces with the Russian Czar's Christian army to seize Anatolia and the Caucasus in order to re-establish ancient Anatolia, which led to Turkey countering the nationalistic forces in order to prevent another war front in the Ottoman Empire?

Massacre or no Massacre, the Armenians in the film had zero interest in learning about the cultural backdrop of their own ancestry (not even Rafi, he only wanted to validate his mother's stories because the thought of his mother as a liar was clearly more upsetting to him than any massacre), nor did they have any remote interest in celebrating and preserving their heritage or achievements, except to promote a painting and an autobiography that proved a massacre. Their sole interest was to pretend to be victims - despite being born and raised in Canada and acculturated in a Western lifestyle - and dismiss any attempts at examining their historical background and observing cultural traditions.

The film depicts ""diaspora"" Armenians as a culture firmly fixated on a massacre and firmly alienated from Armenian culture (past and present).

The cultural reference to the pomegranate was an astronomic miscalculation and indication that Egoyan himself is oblivious to history: the pomegranate, contrary to Armenian belief, first emerged as a fruit and as a cultural and culinary symbol in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and India, then spread as a cultural and culinary symbol throughout the entire Middle East, and Asia, Eurasia, Greece, Spain, Mexico, and beyond.

The symbolic meaning of the pomegranate was clear - pomegranates only grow in dry conditions, the Armenians only feel and grow and ""progress"" when they are void of and ignore their own history and culture (except language), pomegranates root and decay in wet conditions, the Armenians mentally decay when floods of critical questions and doubts and history in its full context inundate them.

Returning to the diaspora concept, none of the Armenians, except Rafi, exhibited any tangible desire to visit Turkey/Armenia, nor did they view their ethnic land as a desirable location to return to, an actual ancestral land where they could unite and rebuild their culture and nation. None of them, except the enigmatic non-Armenian David (Christopher Plummer) exhibited any reticence or discontent with being acculturated into Canadian/Western culture, none of them appeared to feel alienated or insulated from their own ethnic roots, not even the girlfriend, who was strictly frustrated because of Ani's trivialization and dismissal of her father's (and Ani's second husband's) death.

Nothing the Armenians did indicated they wanted a restoration of their original homeland and nation, that they vicariously related to their ancestral homeland, they engaged in any kind of ethnocummunal solidarity, and that meant the Armenians were not ""diaspora"" because diaspora indicates a nation scattered from an ancestral homeland that desires to re-unite and return to the homeland.

And, strangely, nothing the characters presented conclusively proved a ""genocide"" or even massacre occurred.

Egoyan's presentation of the film's strongest theme - memory versus facts versus the fabricated realities people con themselves into believing to make their lives bearable - indicated the massacre itself either never occurred or was exaggerated.

I had the impression that since they were ashamed that their ancestors were unable to defend themselves against violence they themselves possibly instigated, they were exaggerating the circumstances of their deaths to transform the shame and embarrassment and guilt into justifiable scapegoatable anger towards the Turks.

Egoyan ignored the historical fact that during the early 1900's the Turks and other Muslims were also being raped and massacred and expelled from their homes and entire villages and cities by the Russians and Britain and France. The Russians laid inhumane waste and destruction to Anatolia, which resulted in raging starvation and epidemics that killed Turks, in addition to Armenians.

He also ignored the historical fact that Armenians fought side by side with the Ottomans and were serving in the Ottoman government, and that the Ottomans never killed Armenians in Istanbul, Izmir, or Aleppo.

And while the Armenian tragedy was real and horrific, Egoyan ignored the fact that other national groups suffered massive killings at that time, many of which were at a larger scale then the Armenian killings, thus negating the use of the intellectually dishonest and distorted and revisionist use of the term ""genocide"".

During WWI, 1,500,000 Armenians were killed, 1,700,000 Russians were killed, 1,327,000 French people were killed, 1,100,000 Austrian-Hungarians were killed, 908,371 British people were killed, 460,000 Italians were killed, etc, etc.

Saroyan asserts massive genocidal systematic killings occurred based on one eyewitness account, and Rafi's mom insists the killings occurred based on one painter's childhood, and both accounts are repudiated by Egoyan when he has Saroyan refuse to discuss the historical backdrop of Turkey in 1915, when he has Rafi's mother continuously exaggerate the painter's feelings and insist her husband was a hero and insist on dismissing the death of her second-husband out of guilt because she admittedly caused him to commit suicide (which correlates to Armenians feeling guilt about possibly instigating violence against themselves and being unable to defend themselves), when Egoyan has David (Plummer, in an Oscar-deserving performance) violate criminal laws by releasing Rafi despite the heroin in the film reel, when he has Rafi construct his lie to David in order to subconsciously reveal his version of the truth, and when he has Saroyan's film partner place Mount Ararat close to the city of Van which is geographically incorrect.

The sum total of which Egoyan directly illustrates to us that truth is subjective and virtually unknowable, which ironically means that, according to Egoyan's own thematic logic, it is unknowable whether or not an Armenian massacre occurred.

This film can either be a 5/10 for its face value (lackluster everything, linear acting, only Plummer was intensely impressionable and effective) or a 10/10 for its fathomless subtextual, hermeneutical, semiotic value.",1206835200,,10045,5.56385068762279
1460303,3,B00005JLR5,"This was by no means ambitious film by Atom Egoyan.  By addressing complex relationship of a contemporary family between a mother, her son from her first marriage to an Armenian terrorist/freedom fighter (depending on who is talking about the poor lad); her stepdaughter who happens to be her son's lover as well as her deceased husband's daughter from previous relationship, we get to learn about Armenia's history, it's people, art and region.  One of the main points of the movie is to address year 1915 genocide of the Armenian nation by Turks what neither Turks nor the rest of the world have ever fully acknowledged perhaps due to the fact that everyone was busy fighting the WWI.  On pretense of making a historical film about the event, we witness the usual: brutality, muder, rape.  But underneath it all is a story about family and complex emotions that bind any family together.  Choices that we make, affect our families.  The ones that feel consquences of these choices the most are the children.  It seems that for those children it is unbearable that they are unable to control events around them and stop the loss of the people they innately love.  As their parents perish in war, sacrifice themselves for ideals over their family, or seemingly commit suicide over life's disappointments - their children turn to most self-destructive ways or feeling of being alive.  They choose their own path that often is a path of death which puts them closer to their lost parents they still love and miss terribly.  But their death is a slow one and it is thru pain and hurt that they come to the light and get to enjoy the life around them.  As I said in the beginning, it is overly ambitious movie but a nice tribute to a nation, human self sacrifice and love that binds us all at the end.",1202860800,3,1797,4.655063291139241

A powerful scene has a Turkish actor portraying a captor, and the actor tells the director he doesn't believe the massacres occurred at all--not unlike the beliefs of most Turkish-educated people.

1460368,4,B00005JLR5,"This is one of those films that's so complex, multi-faceted, and thought-provoking that it really isn't fair to judge it based on just one viewing alone.  It gets better and makes more sense with repeated viewings.  The audio commentary also helps in understanding it better, explaining or clearing up some things that might not be fully understood, like some of the back stories or scenes that were deleted.  There are so many wonderful deep themes running through this film, like tolerance, the ability to communicate, how the Armenian Genocide has shaped 4 generations (the survivor Arshile Gorky, who was a real historical figure and an amazing artist; Edward Saroyan, the director of the film within the film, the son of a survivor; Ani and her dead first husband, the grandchildren of survivors; and finally young Raffi, the great-grandchild of survivors), memory, denial, the power of symbols, and the fine line between what is real and what is an illusion.  The device of a film within a film particularly brings this lattermost point home; it's used so effectively and hauntingly that often one is left wondering if we're seeing actual historical events in flashback, the inner thoughts and memories of the painter Gorky, the film being shot by Saroyan, or the film as it's being played at its premiere.  It often feels as though one is watching actual events instead of scenes being filmed for another film; a prime example of this is when Ani storms onto the set, destroying a scene that took quite some time to set up, and is berated by the actor playing Dr. Clarence Ussher, who really seems to be talking from the pov of his character, as though he's living these horrific heartbreaking events, and not just some actor who's justifiably angry that she ruined the scene for a seemingly trivial reason.  It's also high time that a film depicted the Armenian Genocide, although of course the Turks are still denying this happened over 90 years later, which makes me livid with rage.

However, this film does seem a bit over-reaching at times, with so many different themes, subplots, and characters, and only a bit under two hours to cover them all and to try to tie them all back together at the end.  We have the film within the film; the story of Arshile Gorky and his famous painting based on a picture taken of him and his mother in 1912; the story of Ali, who plays the evil character Jedvet Bey and who, off-screen, is the partner of Philip; the soon-to-be-retired customs agent David's struggle to accept the fact that his son Philip has left his wife and come out of the closet; the back story of how exactly Ani's second husband died; Ani's troubled relationship with her stepdaughter Celia; Raffi's affair with Celia (they're not blood-related, so it's not incest, even though most people don't accept the idea of stepsiblings having romantic or sexual relationships); Ani's strained relationship with her son Raffi; and finally one of the main plots, Raffi's long interrogation with David, who is convinced that he's smuggling drugs into Canada in what he unwaveringly argues are cans of exposed film for the film within the film.  Much of the film is told as a flashback during this interrogation, during which Raffi is able to explain the Armenian Genocide to an odar (non-Armenian), and ultimately to validate his own experience as a fourth-generation survivor and who he really is, what being Armenian and what this legacy of memory mean to him.

As thought-provoking and moving as this film is, however, it can seem a bit like it overshot the mark, since not all of the subplots seem to be fully resolved or dealt with by the end.  For example, there didn't seem to be any resolution to Ali's story, this half-Turkish actor who feels that his people are the ones telling the truth about these events, who gets scarily into his evil character, and yet who also says this is a new country and that past hatreds and wounds should be put aside.  Perhaps it would have been even better had it been even longer, with more time to fully resolve and explore some of these subplots and back stories, or if a few of them had been eliminated altogether or just scaled back, to allow for the most important stories to take centre stage.  Still, in spite of feeling uneven in spots, this very multi-layered film is designed to make people think, and is a good sight better than most of the trash coming out of Hollywood these days.  The soundtrack is also gorgeous, and many of the songs use genuine Armenian instruments.  It also helps that most of the actors are Armenians themselves, so one gets even more of a feeling that they're acting out their people's real history instead of odars attempting to capture the essence of the Armenian spirit and their people's national consciousness and collective memory.  I'm an odar myself, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in this potent story and history, both Armenian and odar.",1161648000,,4948,4.789906103286385

This occurred in Van, on Turkish soil. Turkey has yet to admit to the event, which attempted the same mindless, brutal, full-scale extermination of a race of people that Hitler attempted in Germany. Like the jews, who were German citizens, the Armenians were Turkish citizens and had every right to expect to be protected, not attacked, by their own government.

1460371,5,B00005JLR5,"I can't remember any film that addresses so many serious topics on such a sophisticated level. While it isn't always successful (some of the actors aren't quite up to the task), I didn't care.

In case anyone misses it, Arshile Gorky (the film's artist) was a real painter. He didn't speak until he was 6, but he could express himself incredibly well through art. Gorky's mother had seen her own father nailed to a church door, and she was forced to watch as the Turks murdered her first husband. She later died by Gorky's side as the fled east of their home away from the Turks.

The photograph of Gorky and his mother is also a real artifact that inspired (and tormented) his later work. Gorky took his name later in life when he came to America. It means ""bitter"" in Russian. In 1946, his studio burnt down, and a later operation gave him a colostomy bag. Finally, a car crash and a physical altercation with his wife led to his family leaving him in 1948. Gorky subsequently hanged himself.

1460442,5,B00005JLR5,"A while back a friend of mine (a *HUGE* Egoyan fan) and I (who views his movies kind of as ""take it or leave it"") got into a heated debate about this movie over lunch. I loved the movie; I thought that it was intricate, had great characters which were subtle and well written, and flowed from the past to the present beautifully. My friend could not forgive the ""movie about making a movie"" plot; he thought it was just too cheesy and it ruined the whole experience for him.

There are some heated reviews of this movie based on it's subject--did it really happen? did it really happen as Egoyan portrayed it? are people using the term ""Holocaust"" and ""genocide"" injudiciously?

For me, when I think of this movie, I think of the conversation between me and my friend. Just as a movie, regardless of Armenian ""experience"", this is still a great movie.

What I loved about it was the personal relationships outside of the broader scope of historical events-- a young man trying to navigate between his relationship with his mother and his girlfriend, a father coming to terms with his gay son, an actor trying to portray something larger than himself, and all the characters trying to come to terms with an event from which they are all far removed. For me this movie is about a historical event (subject to much debate) _AND_ the inter-twining lives of people who otherwise would never have met.

In response to my sullen and disappointed friend: I thought the ""movie about making a movie"" plot was brilliant because you never know what you are watching--the ""truth"" about what really happened, or the ""movie"" the characters are making about what happened or what they want people to *think* happened.

Now, one could make an argument that it's impossible for me to disregard the controversial ""subject"" of the movie and just see an inter-play between characters, and for those of you who think that . . . well, that's what I enjoyed about this movie.

PS: I thought the speacial features on the DVD were kind of lame and didn't match my emotional experience watching the movie. Just skip the features.",1116374400,9,2102,4.682926829268292

1460444,4,B00005JLR5,"A film within a film within a film that plays out through a myriad of interconnected stories sewn into a giant multi-colored tapestry. The so called ""Armenian holocaust"" is the fabric from which director Egoyan spins his narrative, and this event so heavily laden with emotional baggage, becomes almost impossible to approach with intellectual objectivity. The lines between fact and fiction are constantly blurred as in a scene where the protagonist walks onto a movie set about the ""holocaust"" and one of the characters scolds her, not as an actor, but as a very real character from that time. At times this constant commingling loses focus, but Egoyan's heartfelt attempt to bring back the dead through his art imitating art approach, succeeds surprisingly well. Although the ""holocaust"" is shown graphically, Egoyan is aware that we connect most deeply with that to which we can all relate, and this is shown right from the start as an artist attempts to transfer his childhood memories of murdered loved ones to a painter's canvas; the details of a mothers dress . . . the skin of a mothers hand . . . her fingers knitting a quilt. The vivid colors and simple reality of that hand are so compelling they can reach out across decades of despair to caress the forehead, reduce fever, and impart a sense of belonging - a reason for being.  From this inauspicious beginning, Egoyan is able to arrive at a much greater truth: the inherent need for human beings to believe in something - whether or not that belief is grounded in reality or can be proven scientifically. Finally, ARATAT concludes with a simple truth that is just as powerful: the immeasurable but often neglected joy at being able to look upon our loved ones and to hold them in an embrace of life.",1106784000,9,1764,4.764705882352941
1460445,5,B00005JLR5,"I enjoyed the movie and subject matter becauase I am a history buff. I would have enjoyed it more if some of the characters were further developed, and a little less time was spent on the other characters, such as the young man's love interest. Moving into the subject matter of the film, even more interesting is the fact that even today, Turks and Turkish sympathizers continue to deny the atrocities commited by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenians.  Such as the character played by Koteas in the movie.  Even today the Turks continue to disparage and/or deny the atrocities commited by the Turkish government much to the horor of the Armenian families who were victims of the holocaust. Generally it is the position of most Turks and Turkish government proponents that either the Armenian genocide did not occur, or it is grossly exaggerated. Like the holocaust is exaggerated?  Interesting argument, however, sadly for them, and more deeply hurtful to the Armenians, and other victims of genocide/holocaust such as the jews, denial of the occurence of history only firms up the convictions of the survivors or successors to dig deeper and push harder. To conclude, although clearly not Schindler's List or the Pianist in its nature and quality, I believe this movie, although a little rough around the edges, is a very interesting look at a very dark side of human history.",1100131200,14,1382,4.948275862068965
1460446,5,B00005JLR5,"I once read somewhere that the sign of a true literary masterpiece is that one encounters a new interpretation with every reading. Were this standard applied to film, ""Ararat"" would more than qualify as a masterpiece. I know many reviewers, particularly in the mainstream press, have criticized this film for the complexity of it's plot(s). They claim that it makes for a didactic piece that undermines the message of the film. If one actually watches this film, and and I mean REALLY watches it, you come to understand that this complexity is a neccesity. Without it, the film would lose much of it's power. ""Ararat"" is, principally, a film about the complexity of memory. You can't show complexity with one dimensional characters and a simplistic, black and white, point A to point B plot.
This film is so well written that it's literally overwhealming. Practically every sentance seems to have been carefully chosen to bring you back to the themes of betrayal, memory, and interpretation.
The acting in ""Ararat"" is phenomenal. Each actor literally embodies her or his character. I was particularly impressed with the acting of Arsinee Khanjian, David  Alpay, Eric Bogosian, and Christopher Plummer.
With ""Ararat"", Atom Egoyan has done the Armenian community an enormous service. To my understanding, this is the first feature film to ever explicitly deal with the Armenian Genicide. ""Ararat"" is a film that needs to be seen, discussed, and passed on. Perhaps then the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians win't have been in vain.",1098921600,,1527,5.083665338645418
1460447,2,B00005JLR5,"There's really no other way for me to say this. This movie really disappointed me. Obviously the intent was to bring some attention to this horrible moment in time that has been largely forgotten (or never known of) by people who were not directly affected by it. That is why I rented this movie. I've read a few books on the topic, and Armenian musics are some of the world's best, but this movie is a clunker.

There is too much garbage going on. I don't mean that it is hard to follow, because it isn't at all. It's just that 75% of what's happening is trite, as well as extraneous to anything having to do with the genocide itself. There is more than enough tear-jerking ""human drama"" potential within the stories of the genocide itself, so why is so much of the movie wasted on trying to unravel this insipid love-gone-bad tangent among Raffi's mom, her dead ex-husband, and Raffi's step-sister (Daughter of dead ex-husband. She's also Raffi's girlfriend)? The step-sister is a waste of space whom you can't even begin to care about. All she does is whine about her dead father, who had absolutely nothing to do with any storyline related to the genocide.

Then there is the actor playing Raffi. His scenes in customs with Christopher Plummer are painful. He has no emotional power whatsoever. He will relate some horrendous story of the genocide, and then try to ""sell it"" to us by doing his Tom Cruise jaw-muscle flex thing and pretending to be haunted, as he longingly looks into Plummer's eyes. It's horrible. I think only Bokeem Woodbine or Keanu Reeves could have given worse performances here.

Oh did I mention that Christopher Plummer's son is gay and he (dad) is having trouble coming to terms with it. Oh did I mention that Plummer's gay son is dating Elias Koteas who just happens to also be a Turkish colonel or something in the ""movie within a movie"" about the genocide, yet he (Elias' ""real life movie character"", rather than his ""movie in a movie"" character) doesn't think the genocide ever actually happened because all he read about were some deportations as well as the standard ravages of war?

If at this point you're thinking my review is annoying in its mention of all this drivel that has nothing to do with the actual genocide, well, you now have a good picture of exactly what this movie is like. It's as if the director pitched this idea to a studio and the studio said yeah we can do a movie on this topic... as long as it's in the background since we need to add in a love triangle, a step-sister's bare breasts, the strained relationship of a father and his gay son, a boring filmmaker who gives his all to make sure a customs official knows the story of the genocide as they wonder whether or not there is heroin in his film canisters, etc...

Woops did I mention a fictionalized story of Arshile Gorky? It's here, too!

Knowing the story of this atrocity, I fully expected there to be no way I'd get through this movie without breaking down in tears. For me, the Armenian Genocide is one of those events along the lines of Rwanda 1994, or Sudan of the past couple decades, etc... Horrible events that are almost worse (not that that's possible) just for the simple fact that almost no one seems to care, notice, or remember, simply because there seems to be no political or economic gain in caring.

The one great performance in this movie is given by Elias Koteas. Not so much during the ""movie within a movie"" scenes (as it's obvious that movie was going to be worse than Ararat), but during the ""now"" parts of this movie, where he is the gay Turkish actor who doesn't believe the genocide happened. Elias completely inhabits the role of the apathetic, uneducated ""Hey just get over it!"" persona that is so widespread both here in the USA and elsewhere in the world in relation to other atrocities. Thank you Elias! Yes your character was a quiet jerk, but you played him perfectly... easily the most powerful performance of the film. I just feel bad for you that you were stuck having to give this performance in a movie as bad as this.

This event deserves better. I hope someone else makes a movie on this topic someday. A couple of the bonus features here are nice, but still, you'd do better to get that information (and much more) from books.

Do you want to lose yourself in the power and culture of the Armenian people? Skip this movie and pick up any of the CDs by Udi Hrant, Richard Hagopian, Djivan Gasparyan, etc... that I've reviewed here.

On these discs you get pure Armenian cultural power and emotion, with no trite lovestories gone bad and pathetic acting to dilute it.",1098403200,16,4626,4.555956678700361
1460448,5,B00005JLR5,"A MUST SEE!  At first I thought this film was not what I had anticipated.  It seemed it would be an artsy-fartsy film (pardon the expression), and not illuminating the history behind the Armenian genocide of WWI.  It turned out to be much more than what I had expected, and I think everyone concerned about terrorism should see this; there's so much to ponder on in this film.  The action takes place in the present; the past, the history of Armenia, is discussed as a film is being produced on the subject which revolves around an Armenian modern artist's portrait of himself and his mother.  The artist was named Gorkiy.  He tries to resurrect the memory of his mother, who died in the genocide, in that portrait; his only memento of his family is a photograph that he treasured taken of himself and his mother which he recreates in the portrait.  That portrait was the topic of research for an Armenian woman, an art history professor, mother of Raffi, the main character in this movie by Atom Egoyan.  She describes his actions as his attempt to take his memory of her from off the pile of corpses to place her on a pedestal of life.  I loved how that was said, so I chose that for my title of this review.  The artist left the hands of his mother, which lie unfolded in her lap, unfinished.  The way he paints the faces of his mother and himself echo artwork on the walls of an ancient church in his village.  How he finishes painting her hands reveals his deepest longings to reach for her physical presence which was so violently taken from him.

Be forewarned that there is some language and nudity in this film, although it is not overly vulgar; the film is realisitic and honest, but not family friendly.  The contents are heavy.  The only nudity in the film is a love scene between Raffi and his French Canadian girlfriend, and a scene in the fictional film showing Armenian girls dancing nude holding hands in a circle mimicking a bridal dance while the turks douse their bodies with gas, the girls' grisly anointing, before igniting them.  I hate to even mention these atrocities-so much for the sanctity of HUMAN, living, breathing life.  Also, be forewarned that you will hear told nauseating details of the massacres, eyes gouged out (Samson-style), pregnant women raped and then having their wombs slashed open and fetuses slain, boys raped, genitals mutilated etc.  These violent acts, however, do not pervade this film; there is a lot of other material in this film to reflect on.

Ararat is the mountain on which Noah's ark came to rest upon after the biblical flood in Genesis 6-9.  Armenia was the first christian nation before Rome; the Roman emperor Constantine declared christianity its state religion in 300 A.D. or so about the time when the Armenian church went its own way.  The country of Armenia is within Turkey, mount Ararat within its domain.  The Armenian genocide of WWI is significant in that, finally, there are many eyewitness accounts, documentation from people from other nations such as the U.S. and Great Britain.  Armenia is in a strategic location militarily and commercially as it lies within the corridor between Asia and the middle east.  All that is not in this movie, but you NEED to know it!  Attitudes about Armenia are brought out masterfully through discussions between Raffi and an airport security official, played by Christopher Plummer, in several scenes and another between Raffi and the actor, of turkish descent, who plays the brutal pasha of Gorkiy's villayet.  Often viewed as terrorists, in actuality, when these Armenians do fight, it is in resistance, self-defense, against ignoble powers that be.

1460558,5,B00005JLR5,"I liked this movie because unlike most movies about massacre and persecution in the Old World, this movie follows up on the persecuted peoples, in this case the Armenians, as they find the life in their new country-of-refusge, Canada.  As is the case with real, live human beings, escaping persecution to safety and ""freedom"" is not enough to address the complexity of the human soul.  All of the Armenian-Canadians portrayed in the film live in a New World context and suffer from New World problems along with the alienations and isolations of New World lives.  As in all Egoyan movies, most of the film protagonists in this exsemble work do not exist merely as didactic sterotypes.  They breath, their relationship to their heritage is compromised in the personal life, they suffer.  They suffer in a way which is special to the New World, Canada and The United States alike.
Instead of bringing us a dry, linear account, the story of the Armenian massacre in Eastern Turkey is told indirectly, through the filming of a film about it.  In many instances the viewer is confused, not certain if it actually is a flashback to the actual past or merely the scenes of the massacre being filmed for the film.  Does it matter?  What is the relationship between the actual events and the events portrayed in the film?  One keeps wondering about that.
Like all Egoyan films, the production is professional and smooth.  The themes of his earlier movies about emotional disconnection and the use of video and vice to overcome that disconnection appear here as well.  That is perhaps what makes this movie special:  In exploring his own Armenian heritage, he never drops the ball of his old themese and concerns.  He never forgets or ignores thay they are all in Canada now and that the fact that the Armenians were persecuted in the Old World, does not solve their problems of existentiality and their own estrangement in a New World Society.
Egoyan offers us a new model for the making of films about cataclyismic, life ruining problems.  I wish that movies of this  type could have been made about the Jewish Holocaust and the Palestinian Refugee Problem.",1080950400,13,2149,4.817438692098093

This shamelessly didactic scene was the equivalent of, and I think I would prefer this, someone beating me upside the head with a baseball bat having the Koran inscribed on it.

The customs officer (Christopher Plummer) begins a long and tedious interrogation in regards to the tin containers, which has it roots in a 1915-1918 genocide of Turkish Armenians.  The story that the young man reveals is tied to him, his fathers death 15 years ago, stepfather's death, a film director, a film production, his step sister, his mother, a gay couple, a famous painter, and how the Armenian holocaust affects them in today's society.  The cross-examination also brings a symbolic meaning to whether the 1915-1918 genocide of Turkish Armenians, which is still denied to this day by the Turkish government, ever took place.  Egoyan brings another cerebral story to the audience as he displays his vast knowledge of human behavior and the denial people deal with under unpleasant circumstances.  In addition, the script is a clever creation as it exposes human nature in natural dialogues from a wide variety of multifaceted characters who bring different lights to the issue at hand.",1076198400,6,1149,5.155913978494624
1460561,5,B00005JLR5,"I had not wanted to watch Ararat, as I had not liked Egoyan's Calender, however, knowing Aznavour was appearing in the movie,I felt I had to see it. It was brilliant and full of Awen (Celtic word for devine inspiration).  My audio play ""1921 the Christmas Letter"" had just begun airing on radio stations and is about the Armenian Genocide and I only wish I knew where to send it to Egoyan and Aznavour as thank you presents. My family was from Kerope (only 56 known survivors) and my father now 93, escaped from Turkey to Russia, got caught up in the Russian Revolution, and then escaped back into Turkey and then to America, all by the age of ten. I've lived with the Genocide all my life and am tired of people not even knowing what an Armenian is. This movie is about all genocides, and it touched me to the depths of my soul. As a writer I loved the subtlety and the stories within stories, as well as the almost twist of an end. The acting was excellent and not overdone and dramatic to the point of being a mochery. I have recomended this movie to everyone who is sensitive,caring, intelligent and those that need to be enlightened about what the denial of the genocide means to someone like me. I have been angry all my life. I have bled and cried in my despair. I have pleaded with the ancient gods of Urartu for justice. When will there ever be a justice with eyes and a mouth that sees and speaks the truth?  Will the Turks ever know the truth, or is Justice as blind as the Turks have been for over a century?  Ararat, gave me hope. As a writer, (10 books including ""The Armenians of Worcester"") I include Armenians in many of my stories and articles. I think the antique world knows what an Armenian is but what about the nurse at the hospital who asked it Armenians came from Pakistan, or the couple in Atlanta, who asked me what tribe of Indians the Urartians were? You think sometimes it is just like banging your head on the wall and then a miracle happens and this miracle is called Ararat.

1460562,5,B00005JLR5,"The Armenian genocide constitutes one of the twentieth century's most shameful incidents. Largely forgotten today due to later, better publicized exterminations, the systematic killing of some one million Armenian people by the crumbling Ottoman Empire in 1915 still stirs controversy today. Turkey goes to great lengths to deny such an atrocity ever took place, but Armenian survivors and their descendants know better. The reasons for this event involved Ottoman politics of the time, with the rise of the reformist Young Turk movement within the Ottoman political system and its ""promise"" about granting autonomy to ethnic and religious minorities. In a case of ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss,"" the Young Turks soon reneged on their promises and began a series of suppressions. Armenia suffered the most from the Young Turks sudden political reversal. Only with the defeat and dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire after World War I did the genocide end. President Woodrow Wilson redrew the boundaries of Armenia, a process that angered the Turks and directly led to the current revisionism concerning the massacre. Atom Egoyan's film ""Ararat"" deals directly, and indirectly, with this horrific historical event.
Thanks to an individual who really knows her stuff about film, I decided to pay a visit to Atom Egoyan. ""Ararat"" was my first choice, and a good one at that even though the film is often confusing--often wonderfully so--in structure. The primary reason for this concerns the numerous storylines weaving their way through the tapestry of the film. We meet, by turns, an Armenian art historian named Ani (played by the gorgeous Arsinee Khanjian), her son Raffi (David Alplay), a customs official named David (Christopher Plummer), two men making a film about the genocide (played by Eric Bogosian and Charles Aznavour), Ani's stepdaughter and David's lover Celia (Marie-Josee Croze) and an up and coming actor in a relationship with David's son named Ali (Elias Koteas). Ani is an art historian working on a project about the famous Armenian painter Arshile Gorky, who was so affected by the loss of his mother in the genocide that he painted a picture of her when he arrived in America. Unable to deal with the memories of the massacre, Gorky ultimately committed suicide. As Ani documents this troubled man's life, she must deal with the highly inappropriate relationship between her son David and her French Canadian stepdaughter Celia. Celia believes Ani drove her father to commit suicide, a claim Ani fervently denies.
Meanwhile, we meet customs official David, an embittered soul set to retire from his job in a matter of days. He is angry that his son left his wife in order to form a relationship with an out of work actor of Turkish descent named Ali. Ali receives a phone call from two filmmakers offering him the role of Jevdet Bey, one of the thugs responsible for the Armenian genocide. At roughly the same time, the two filmmakers, one of whom had intimate knowledge of the massacre, approach Ani about consulting on the film. Raffi soon arrives on the scene to work on the picture, and ultimately ends up taking a trip to the area where the massacre took place. On his return, he finds himself held up at customs by--surprise--David, who believes the young man is probably a heroin smuggler. As the film unfolds, most of what we know about the characters comes through flashbacks in an extended conservation between Raffi and David. Egoyan also employs a ""film within a film"" technique that adds further doubts about the veracity of unfolding events.
""Ararat"" is a brilliant film, even more so after you have seen it and think through some of the issues presented by Egoyan. I agree with the editorial reviews that state the movie deals with memory and how it affects people through time and across space. Celia's hostility towards Ani marks one aspect of how memory often assumes a slippery dimension, but the real kicker supporting this theme occurs during the lengthy conservations between David and Raffi. The whole dialogue is an effort on the part of Raffi to convince David that the Armenian genocide took place. David is a world-weary cynic unwilling to believe in Raffi's story, but he comes around in the end and ultimately accepts it. Or does he? The last scene where David opens a certain item and sees what is in it encapsulates the entire idea of the film. Should we believe in Raffi's story, especially after we see what David finds? Where is the evidence of the massacre? Is it in the ruins Raffi filmed on his trip and then showed to David? How do we really know these ruins represent the genocide? There are accounts left behind by American missionaries and other Europeans who were there when the events unfolded, but should we trust personal recollections? By forcing us to rely on narrative accounts regarding the massacre and not hard evidence, Egoyan shows us how it is possible for the Turks to deny their involvement in the slaughter.
""Ararat"" is a challenging film. I don't think this summary resolves any of the movie's numerous issues, but hopefully it will provide the impetus for you to get out and pick up a copy. Even if you have little interest in watching the film for the deeper issues, check it out for the wonderful acting. The scene where Ali challenges Raffi over the reality of the genocide should not be missed by anyone who appreciates powerfully compelling performances. ""Ararat"" is a brutal film containing recreations of Turkish atrocities, so it is definitely off limits to the kiddies, but it isn't horrific for the sake of sensationalism. This is a film worth watching more than once (and probably necessary to watch more than once in order to understand it).",1076025600,38,5745,4.94824016563147
1460563,5,B00005JLR5,"The Armenian genocide deserves its ""Sophie's Choice"" but ""Ararat"" isn't that film. Instead Atom Egoyan makes us confront history as imperfect, frustrating and necessary.
As with all Egoyan film, narration is never taken for granted and we follow several interconnected stories including that of a film-maker producing a straightforward film of Armenian genocide, another of a young man who is interrogated by Canadian immigration, a reflection on the life of Amil Gorky, the great Armenian artist as its retold by a historian who in turn is stalked by a step-daughter who holds the historian responsible for her own father's death.
While grief and loss are often on display in Egoyan's film, those feelings are typically mediated by his presentation of powerful ideas and oblique storytelling.  In Ararat, the grief and loss aren't as mediated.  Egoyan is part Armenian and the story he tells is personal and heartfelt.  That feeling comes through on film and yet it doesn't slop over into easy sentiment or self righteousness.  This is a film I would show freshman history majors to help them understand that interpretation, ideas and facts must not be allowed to overwhelm the emotional impact world events have individual lives.",1075766400,5,1231,5.202020202020202
1460564,5,B00005JLR5,"This is a film that will haunt you for days after you have seen it. The sickening scenes of the turks killing Armenian cililians you will find hard to shake from your head.
But what really makes this such a brilliant movie is not just the fact that it deals with a little known attempt to eradicate a race of people off the face of the earth, but that it looks at the impact of this on survivors of the genocide 85 years later. How do modern day Armenians deal with the fact that the Turks tried to eradicate them from the face of the planet? The stories of what happened is part of who they are, in the same way that Hitlers attempt to wipe the Jewish people of the face of the planet is part of who they are. It cannot just be ""forgotten"", they cannot just ""get on with their life in a new country"". The pain and anger of what happened will stay with all Armenians.
Which brings me to the opinions of those Turks who ask why Armenians hold such hatred for the Turks, or claim the genocide never happenned. I will state first off that I do not have any Armenian heritage, though I am lucky enough to have friends of both Armenian and Turkish background. One of the main reasons for Armenians holding such hatred to Turks to this day is the fact that Turkey has refused to admit that they did anything wrong and apologise for it. It is this that  causes many Armenians to hate Turks with such vehemence.
As for the arguement that this did not happen, this is just a plain lie. There are eyewitness testimonies from people from Neutral countries about what happenned. Even more damming is the fact that there are documents from German officials and military (Turkey's ally in WW1) about what happenned. But worst of all there are Turkish Government documents that detail the orders to massacre Armenian civilians. As for the arguement that Armenian Bandits were attacking Turkish civilians, this may be true. But a civilised country punishes the bandits, it does not massacre innocent civilians.
I strongly recommend everybody watches this movie. It is not an easy movie to watch, but you will come away from it moved, and more knowledgeable then you were before you watched it. You cannot say that about many films.",1070064000,19,2215,4.509950248756219
1460565,4,B00005JLR5,"Several plotlines unfold in this movie.  All are built around the theme of knowing what happened when outside an event.  To understand the parallels being drawn when you first watch the film I respectfully suggest focusing on just two of the plotlines.  Juxtapose the main plotline, the perspectives that two native Canadians (one of Turkish descent, the other of Armenian descent) bring to the filming in the present day of a movie about the liquidation by Turks of some number of Armenians and what came before it, with the death of a man and how that death is viewed by that man's wife and daughter.  The daughter says the man was essentially driven to death by the wife, the wife says the man died by accident.  The moment of the death is depicted in a flashback from a third-person perspective.  At the crucial moment, however, the camera pans away and back and we don't know why the man is dead, only that he is dead.  As a result both wife and daughter have plausible arguments, but we (and they) will never know the ""truth"".  Just as the film within the film is an attempt to tell but one side's ""truth"", so do both Canadians, ethnic Turk and ethnic Armenian, adopt positions that suit their ancestral identity and take as their starting point the events that suit their argument, but they will never know the ""truth"".  And meantime two people who are both human beings distance themselves from each other because they cannot live with ambiguity about the past (a past they never experienced to boot).  And so: Armenians and Turks are dead.  Bosnians and Serbs are dead.  Jewish Semites and Arab Semites are dead.  Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants are dead.  Shall we in this ""New World"" add to those dead or shall we affirm that we are all one race, the human race.  That is the question that Egoyan answers in the affirmative and why I enjoyed this brilliant effort that is at least as deserving of acclaim as Rashomon.",1068854400,7,1934,4.6304985337243405
1460566,5,B00005JLR5,"ARARAT is one of the more demanding films by the talented Atom Egoyan and at the same time is one of the more satisfying and literate.  Many viewers have commmented on how confusing the film is in its narrative technique, but it is this intricate maze effect of telling a story that for me is its most powerful quality. Perhaps having recently read Peter Balakian's THE BURNING TIGRIS  added to the experience of the historical aspect of Egoyan's story: the Armenian Genocide by the Turks is profoundly felt by not only Armenians but by all defenders of human rights and at the same time the Turks utterly deny this incident in history.  How genteel of Egoyan to put the whole 'debate' into the form of a movie within a movie.  He has contemporary characters (Raffi, a young man searching for the truth to his past incredibly well portrayed by David Alpay, Ani his mother is an Art Historian played to perfection by Arsinee Khanjian, Christopher Plummer is a Customs Agent who is dealing with his own demons, Elias Koteas is an actor asked to play the role of a Turk in the film being directed by Charles Aznavour and just happens to be the gay lover of Christopher Plummer's son). Egoyan has Raffi photograph the few remaining shrines that stand for the evidence of the existence of his lost people while his mother continues to teach about the artist Arshille Gorky who escaped the genocide to move to New York and become established as an exemplary painter but was only able to erase the memories of the genocide by his own suicide.  Egoyan constantly shifts from the contemporary story to historical re-enactments as they are being shot as scenes for a film.  Yes, there are moments of time warp when as a viewer we are never sure just what is real and what is manufactured on film, but isn't that the main problem with the question of the Armenian Genocide?  With quiet intensity Egoyan places us in the shoes of history, of memory, of personal demons, of ethnic and national demons and in doing so he opens our eyes more powerfuly than an ordinary documentary ever could.
Not only is the story superb, but the filming and the acting is absolutley first rate.  While the overall story is about despair and sadness, there are moments of ecstatic joy that come when you least expect them. Some fragments of the story are resolved, some are left for further introspection. This film is an extraordinary achievement.",1066867200,23,2417,4.683962264150943
1460617,4,B00005JLR5,"This film is considered important because it brings to light a virtually forgotten(by some) episode in twentieth-century history: the genocide of  1.5 million Armenians by the Turks during WWI. Unfortunately the film never really explains why it happened nor does it explain why it was forgotten. In other words the history is presented but not examined. What is examined is how the genocide continues to haunt the Armenians.
For those interested in the facts I would suggest a recent book: The Burning Tigris, The Armenian Genocide and America's Response by Peter Balakian.
Arsinee Khanjian plays Ani an art history professor who has just written a book about Arshile Gorky. She has also been twice widowed. One of her husbands died trying to assassinate a Turkish official( a revolutionary act or an act of terrorism depending on your perspective) and another husband committed sucide or fell or was pushed from a cliff--uncertainty informs every aspect of these characters lives.  Ani lives in a kind of academic cocoon; she hides behind her expertise and only indirectly deals with the past by studying and lecturing about Gorky who was a survivor of the genocide.  When she is hired as a consultant on a film version of the genocide she reluctantly accepts the position and  compromises her reputation and integrity. Why she does this is unclear. Her son(by the revolutionary-terrorist)  meanwhile is having an affair with his stepsister(her dad the one that fell or was pushed). Both children struggle with their private histories and each comforts the other one as they try to come to terms with a past that their mother avoids.  Confused? Well the film makes it all clear, to a point. The psychologies of these three are explored and they are each intriguing individuals dealing with the past in their own private way. Arguably though they are not explored  thoroughly enough and even at the end of the film I am not certain there is any real understanding between these three or if the audience has been given enough information to really feel they know what they each have gone through.  It is perhaps a minor (or major) fault of the film that it is so complex that you find yourself focusing more on keeping the plot straight than on really understanding what drives the characters. I watched it twice however and even after a second viewing there is still a lot that reamins vague about these characters to me still.  Why did Ani accept the consulting position? What does her son learn when he visits Ararat by himself and how does this transform him?  Does the daughter really love her brother or is this just her way of taking revenge on her mother?
Egoyan films are fascinating because they enter into realms of emotion that no man (at least no film maker) has gone before. The psychologies Egoyan focuses on are all in pain so his films are difficult on the emotions.  The actress who played the daughter Cecile(I beleive she is Spanish) is particularly excellent.  As difficult at it is to watch her performance is an eerlily authentic one.
Arshile Gorky's famous self-portrait as a child standing next to his mother  represents the irrevovable past and lost innocence. But it bothered me that Ani allowed herself to be used by the film within a films director and writers who simply wanted her name to lend credibility to the very uncredible fictionalizing of Gorky's life.
Elias Koteas plays a Turkish actor hired to play a Turkish official in the film within a film. On screen he gives a powerful performance and offscreen he openly denies that the genocide actually occured. It is a role(and attitude) which could have been explored more thoroughly. Instead it just feels like a token gesture to represent the Turkish version of the genocide (which in Egoyan's view is simply one of denial).
The ambition behind Ararat is commendable but I think ultimately the film either should have been longer to allow for more character development (especially with the Koteas character) or there should have been fewer plot lines. It feels kind of like a juggling act at times with one too many items in the air.  Perhaps Egoyan purposely leaves many things unresolved because that is the way life is but as art it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. Too many loose ends. They are interesting loose ends nonetheless. Like the Gorky painting which remained unfinished this film feels unfinished.
Egoyan fans will love this film but others will probably have a mixed response as they decide for themselves what the film does well and what not so well.",1066694400,8,4555,4.875808538163001
1460618,5,B00005JLR5,"Where to begin...This is wonderful tribute to the Armenian people and the Genocide that was visited upon them by Muslim turks.  Lets not forget these turks, these people who call us racists and call this movie racist.  The turks are beasts who murdered every Armenian in Turkey and every Greek as well(visit turkey and you will find no more christians, what happaned to all these people? did they all leave, no they were murdured).  This movie helpes Armenians understand a neccesary heritage and will help others understand this very central event of the 20th century.
The Armenians genocide was the first of this century, but not he last. It served as a blueprint for other mass executions from Hitler to Stalin to Pol Pot.  The Armenians were murdered when no one was looking, just like the Jews.  Unlike the Jews the Armenians have not garned much attention, because everyone in the western press wants to call Islam a religion of 'peace'.  Islam, as we see in this great film, is a religion of hate and intolerance and nothing more.  This film will make you yearn for  revenge against the enemy,  and will make you understand the motive of the Armenians terrorists who used to kill Turkish diplomats(a deed for which heaven reserves a special place).
This movie is not to be missed, it is a great rendition of a classic struggle between the self, the soul and the nation.  To understand ourselves and to carve our fate we must know our past, this movie will evoke this in waves.",1064016000,5,1483,4.691119691119691

1460620,4,B00005JLR5,"The Canadian writer/director, Atom Egayan, is of Armenian heritage, and his 2002 film tries to be an historical account of the murder of one million Armenians by Turkey in 1915.  This is a controversial issue because the Turkish government still insists that it never happened.  The film itself leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  And delves much deeper than mere historical events.  The general plot is about a film being made about the atrocities, and the interrelationships between everyone concerned with it.  The director combines various time periods, levels of reality, family relationships and questions about historical accuracy.  The acting is uniformly excellent. But the film is so confusing that somehow something gets lost.
I found it almost impossible to follow the plot and kept replaying parts of the DVD to make sure I understood what was going on.  Basically, it centers around a young man, Raffi, played by David Alpay, whose father was slain while trying to assassinate a Turkish official during a visit to Canada.  His mother, played by Arsinee Khangian, is an art historian of Armenian heritage and there are lots of comparisons of their relationship with that of the Armenian artist, Arshile Gorky whose mother was murdered in the slaughter.  Add to this mix an aging customs inspector, played by Christopher Plummer, who attempts to determine if Raffi is smuggling drugs and who just happens to have a troubled relationship with is own son whose lover played a Turkish officer in the film.  And then there is Raffi's stepsister, with whom Raffi is having a romantic relationship, whose father committed suicide after a brief marriage to Raffi's mother. Confusing?  Well, yes it is.
And yet this is a film with a lot to say.  It's about genocide.  It's about complex family relationships.  It is about the search for truth.  And, mostly, it is about the many personal decisions that have to be made about what reality is.  I was intrigued and fascinated throughout.  And saddened and horrified by the violence.  And yet, because I was constantly confused by what was going on and trying to follow the plot, I never really got swept away with the story in a way that made me feel emotion.  I recommend this film to those interested in history and also for those interested in the work of a brilliant director.

It is funny that each year the number of Armenians that ""have been killed"" by Turks increases exponentially. According to the movie 1.5 million Armenians have been killed in 1915. However, if this is true, it is not clear who are the people who call themselves Armenians now.
The only fact that movie relies on is the diary of a painter and his painting. There is no reliable source in the movie.

I went with 3 other people and thought the theater would be empty.  To my surprise, the theater was PACKED and we were barely able to get seats (we needed to sit apart)....this was even after the movie had been in theaters for a while.
I know about the 1915 Armenian Genocide where 1.5-2 million Armenians were exterminated (learned about it in college), and was skeptical about how the movie would come out.  I think Atom Egoyan had quite a challenge in making it considering there have been NO PREVIOUS MOVIES BASED ON THIS TRAGIC HISTORICAL EVENT and Turkey still denies it.  By judging how packed the theater was, and how quiet everyone was while watching it, I think it's safe to say he did a SPECTACULAR JOB!
Reading about it in a textbook is one thing, but watching it on screen is another! If you were not moved while watching this movie then you are probably as heartless as the turks and nazi's who commited Genocide! I recommend any college, university, or high school professors and teachers to use this movie as an aid to lectures on Genocide and Haulocaust.  The movie within a movie helps make the history more clear.
If you don't believe me, then read the NEW YORK TIMES review:
""... Ararat is hands down the year's most thought-provoking film.""
It's not just a story that deals with the Armenian Genocide and issues of truth and denial....it deals with so many other issues people in present day society live with every day.  There is a struggle between the loyalty toward family vs. loyalty toward significant others.
Put all the secondary and tertiary story lines and themes aside.  This has been the first movie about the ARMENIAN GENOCIDE-the first Genocide of the 20th century (before the haulocaust) and it was long overdue.  It's a tragic chapter in the history of humanity where Armenians as well as Greeks, Assyrians and other Christians were also persecuted and massacred.
Hopefully this movie will educated more people about what happened so we won't be destined to repeat history.  This is evident in history when Hitler gave encouragement to his followers by saying.....who after all remembers the Armenians?

1460696,3,B00005JLR5,"In 1915, right in the midst of World War I when the eyes of the world were focused on other corners of the planet, the Turks slaughtered over a million of their own Armenian citizens in a holocaust that the Turks to this day deny ever happened.  Atom Egoyan's complex, though not entirely successful film, ""Ararat,"" attempts to show just how long a shadow this horrific genocide still casts over the Armenian people today.
Rather than simply make a film set at the time of the genocide, Egoyan has chosen to set his film in the present and have his vast assortment of characters reflect on what this almost century-old event means to them in their present lives (most of them are second generation Armenians and Turks living in Canada).  One of those characters is an aged film director who, in honor of his mother who endured the atrocities, has come to Canada to make a film about the event.  Thus, all the glimpses we get of the actual genocide are film-within-a-film reenactments.  In a bit of irony, Egoyan shows just how difficult it is for any work of art to faithfully capture the ""truth"" of such an event, for falsehoods inevitably creep into the picture the moment the artist alters even minor facts under the guise of ""artistic license.""  This is particularly ironic given the fact that ""truth"" and ""facts"" are such an important part of the case the Armenians have built against the Turks.  The film deals head-on with what is ""truth"" and how much of history comes down to a matter of personal perception.
Egoyan has provided a veritable labyrinth of characters and events, so much so that it becomes almost impossible to provide anything near a comprehensive summary of either the plot or the people who are caught in its entanglements and complexities.  Suffice it to say that the film deals with such weighty themes as the intricacies of mother/child relationships, coming to terms with the ghosts from both the private and collective past, and the part denial plays in assuaging our own sense of guilt and responsibility for unspeakable events in history.  This denial then allows us to live our lives in unconcerned complacency.
Egoyan views his film almost as a giant canvas and he keeps throwing characters onto it, often without painting the strokes in clear enough detail for us to understand fully what is going on (an apt analogy, given the fact that one of the characters is an actual painter and he deliberately leaves part of his artwork unfinished).  Some of the people we meet are fascinating and complex, while others seem underdeveloped and too enigmatic to make much of a contribution to our comprehension of the material.  Occasionally, we get the nagging impression that a number of the minor characters and plot strands are left hanging in a state of unresolved limbo.  Moreover, the film occasionally lapses into a pedantic tone, as if the writer felt it more important to provide us with a history lesson than involve us in a drama.  What promises to be an enlightening character study frequently becomes a polemic.
Structurally, ""Ararat"" is very complex, with the director cutting back and forth between characters in the present, one character in the past, and the events of the genocide as depicted in the film being made.  Egoyan deserves credit for bringing it all together even if the very artifice of the format ends up distancing the audience from the emotional immediacy of this very grim subject matter.  ""Ararat"" is more of an intellectual exercise than an emotionally involving drama, but it does serve a salutary purpose in raising the public's consciousness about a shameful, tragic moment in history that has for too long gone unrecognized by the general public.",1059004800,18,3712,4.862123613312203

1460698,5,B00005JLR5,"I had no idea what to expect with Atom Egoyan's new film ARARAT. It has received many negative reviews and scant few good ones. As a big Egoyan fan, I was worried. Would this be the first of his films that I wouldn't enjoy? And the subject, the Armenian Genocide... I just couldn't imagine what Egoyan would attempt that put off so many people. Needless to say, I was completely surprised at how amazing this film is.
ARARAT is not a film about the Armenian genocide. It is a film about truth and history. About how sometimes the way we tell a story is more important than the story itself. He uses the Armenian genocide as the backdrop... the subtext... There's a film within the film that IS in fact about the Armenian genocide. I think the people who didn't like Egoyan's film were looking for something more akin to the film within the film. I was much more interested in the film Egoyan chose to make.
In this film, Charles Aznavour plays a well-known director who is making a film about the Armenian genocide. His style is very over-the-top, with a strong Hollywood epic feel to it. After hearing a lecture by Ani (Arsine Khanjian), an art history scholar who has recently written a book about a famous Armenian artist who survived the genocide, he and his writer (Eric Bogosian) decide to enlist her help on the movie as a historic consultant, in order to provide accurate details on the film even as they stretch the truth even further to make a dramatic story. Ani's son Raffi is also hired as a production assistant on the film in the hopes that he will come to better understand what happened between the Armenians and Turks and why. Raffi's father was killed in a failed attempt to assassinate a Turkish diplomat 15 years ago. Raffi also has a step-sister, who was the daughter of Ani's first husband. She blames Ani for her father's death (murder? suicide?) and continually appears at Ani's book readings asking disturbing questions linking the subject of her book (who also committed suicide) with her first husband. And there's even more...
There were so many things I admired in this complex, ambitious film. I love the way Egoyan jumps around in time and doesn't really give you any clues... you just have to sit back and figure it out. The film within the film... the one actually about the Armenian Genocide... is stilted and overblown, much like most big Hollywood productions, but not without the horror and tragedy inherent in situation. There are some amazing scenes in ARARAT, especially the ones where Egoyan tries to find an understanding in the Turks point of view regarding the genocide and their inability to accept it. And amazing performances as well. Charles Aznavour is terrific as the director. Christopher Plummer is superb in a quiet performance as an airport customs officer who interviews Raffi on his return to Toronto after a trip to Turkey. And how delightful to see Arsine in such a large, dramatic part. She really shines in this difficult role. David Alpay is fairly strong in the tricky role of Raffi, especially in his dramatic scenes with Christopher Plummer.
One of the many criticisms I've read about ARARAT is how the dialogue is so expository. I didn't find it so at all. One of the points of the film is how the story of the Armenian genocide has been lost, and that people don't talk about it. There's a lot of explanation on what happened in that period of history told through dialogue, which is as it should be in this film. After all, it's NOT a film about the genocide itself, but who it has been dealth with. Plummer's David, when trying to determine if Raffi is smuggling drugs explains that while it's true, trained dogs could easily sniff out the drugs, he prefers his method of talking to the suspect to find out the truth through dialogue. It's a powerful moment, especially in retrospect when the entire film is revealed.
ARARAT is complex, ambitious, thought-provoking, and masterful. I was so delighted by it after expecting something very different.",1047254400,19,4017,4.7236467236467234
1460699,5,B00005JLR5,This movie does deserve a 5/5 stars.  It shows how determined the Armenians are to getting their point across. I myself am 1/8th Armenian and I didn't really know that all that Armenians wanted was to get an appology.  They don't care about the land lost and the blood shed. It is extremely frustrating when someone has hurt you and doesn't want to admit to what they did.,1045180800,9,372,4.455882352941177
1460700,5,B00005JLR5,"About a month ago I went to see a new movie ARARAT.  Frankly, I had some reservations but the director and Charles Aznavour helped me to make a decision.  Two hours later, I found myself still sitting in the movie with all people around.  It was quiet, the lights were on and no one moved.  The show was over but we were still enchanted by it.
The multifaceted story leads you in many different directions but all meeting at the same point - the point of the Armenian Genocide in 1915.  The screenplay was masterfully written and the whole movie was so fragile with questions raised by it.  ARARAT is a very emotional movie which generates even more emotions from the viewer.",1043798400,35,675,4.491803278688525
1460701,2,B00005JLR5,"ARARAT is a sincere attempt on the part of the film's creators to acquaint the audience with the horrors of the genocide delivered by the Turkish government upon its Christian Armenian citizens during the First World War, and which resulted in the deaths of over a million, or about two-thirds of the Armenian population. The screenwriter tried to tell the story in an imaginative way. Unfortunately, the screenplay came out too clever to the point of being a boondoggle, and I came away disappointed and with a headache. Four different timelines and several subplots converge into such a mess that it'll be difficult to write a lucid synopsis.
Gosh, where to begin?
In several brief flashbacks, it's 1931 and Armenian artist Arshile Gorky (Simon Abkarian), having emigrated to North America, is shown painting a portrait based on a photograph of him and his mother taken in Turkish Armenia in 1912. Gorky's mother was subsequently killed in the genocide, and her memory haunts him deeply.
In the recent past, art historian Ani (Arsin&eacute;e Khanjian), an Armenian living in Toronto, gives lectures on the life of Arshile Gorky and uses his painting of 1931 as a backdrop for her presentations . Ani is also a collaborator with film director Edward (Charles Aznavour) in the making of a film, also called ARARAT, about the Turkish army's seige and capture of the Turkish Armenian city of Van in 1915 based on the memoirs of an American missionary, Clarence Ussher (Bruce Greenwood), stationed there. The inhabitants are subsequently burned alive, mutilated or tortured, or driven out into the desert where most are raped, bayoneted or shot. A young Gorky (Garen Boyajian) is one of the survivors. The 1915 timeline, and the events surrounding the Van abomination, are depicted in the scenes of the film within the film, ARARAT within ARARAT.
The last and most recent timeline has Ani's young, adult son Raffi (David Alpay) returning to Canada after spending time in Turkey filming footage of Van's ruins that could be used in the making of Edward's ARARAT. On his way through Customs, he's stopped by David (Christopher Plummer), a humorless inspector spending his last day on the job before retirement. In an extended sequence that apparently lasts hours, David interrogates Raffi about the contents of several film cans (of supposedly exposed film). David suspects they contain heroin, but listens to Raffi's earnest explanation of the ARARAT film and the events that inspired it because the young man is obviously a True Believer.
There's another subplot, which occurs before Raffi takes off to Turkey, involving Ani, Raffi, and the former's stepdaughter Celia (Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze). Raffi is sleeping with Celia despite the fact that the latter believes Ani drove her second husband (Celia's father) to suicide. The relationship between Ani and Celia is decidedly not warm and fuzzy, and Raffi is caught in the middle. Raffi's own father, Ani's first husband, was an Armenian ""freedom fighter"" killed while trying to assassinate a Turkish official.
Have I lost you yet?
Perhaps director/producer/writer Atom Egoyan got so wrapped up in the artistic aspects of his creation that he lost his way amidst unnecessary complexity and simply blundered into his original goal, which was to produce a film that indeed thrusts the Armenian Genocide into the viewer's consciousness (and will perhaps throw gasoline on the smoldering embers of hatred of those who'd prefer not to forget past tribal vendettas). The David/Raffi and Ani/Celia interactions might better have been left on the cutting room floor and the old adage, ""keep it simple"", taken to heart. Certainly, truly great and memorable films about the bloody and savage business of ethnic cleansing can be made. SCHINDLER'S LIST comes immediately to mind. Would that Egoyan had seen it and taken notes on style.",1042761600,6,3872,5.157392686804451
1460702,5,B00005JLR5,Not once in my history classes was the genocide in Armenia ever mentioned something I find this very disturbing.  It's about time a movie like this was made to let people know that this actually happened.  I read about this genocide recently and was phisically ill.  To cover it up or denie it happened is the worst kind of evil,1039651200,8,328,4.433333333333334
1460763,3,B00005JLR5,"That Atom Egoyan is one of the very best directors making movies today is beyond reproach. If he had only made the elegant and stunning ""The Sweet Hereafter"" his place among the pantheon of directors would be assured. So what happened with ""Ararat?""
In a nutshell, ""Ararat"" is too complicated; filled with too many sub-plots and extraneous material not central to the plot. It's as if Agoyan, in his need to set the record straight about the Armenian Genocide says too much.  The problem with all of this is that it takes away from the dramatic core of the movie: ""Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.""
The Armenian Genocide by the Turks at the beginning of the 20th. Century is innately rife with sorrow, pathos and human despair but Atom Egoyan would have better served his people and his subject had he made a simple, straightforward dramatic film based on Clarence Ussher's Diaries, an American doctor and an eye-witness.
Several story elements do work, though: the story of Arshile Gorky and his mother become a touchstone for the entire film: it's emotional center. Also, Raffi's (David Alpay) plot line with the customs official (Christopher Plummer) though realistically implausible is nonetheless dramatically true.  Some of the performances are also first rate: David Alpay, Christopher Plummer and Charles Aznavour as the director of the film-within-a-film.
As in most of Egoyan's films, events and how they are recalled and thereby inevitably interpreted by a group of people is at the core of ""Ararat."": Recollection as a way of eventually getting at the truth of a thing.
For the most part, ""Ararat"" is well thought out and humane and it definitely brings to the forefront a piece of history many of us know nothing about. But ultimately ""Ararat"" does not carry it's grim burden well: telling the horrific story of the decimation of a people; a story too long hidden away in the history books (if there at all) of these heroic Armenians many of whom survive today and remain irrevocably scarred by it.",1039132800,4,2028,4.909620991253644

To fully understand and appreciate the pure brilliance of this film, one must look beneath the surface. There is so much detail, so much depth and so much beauty underneath the very important and very moving storyline. The film is extremely crucial for the Armenian people and depicts the events of the Armenian Genocide through a film-within-a-film which connects all the characters and events. This, in my opinion, was a wonderful way to tell the tragic story of the Armenian Genocide. Egoyan got his point across with minimal, if any, propaganda. I have seen ARARAT twice and absolutely loved it. The movie lingered in my mind weeks afterward and I cannot wait to see it again. An absorbing storyline, a tightly plotted script, wonderful characters, and some brilliant directing makes this, in my opinion, the best film of the year!!

7939411,1,B00005JLR5,"Arafat changes historical horror into pretentious melodrama.  The basic conceit of the film is that of a film about the Armenian genocide, directed by a man played in the movie by Charles Aznavour in the only plausible performance in it, within a film about the Armenian genocide.  That conceit is supposed to make one think about the relationship of art to historical truth.  It does no such thing.  To that complexity is added, among other excesses, a love affair between a young man and his step sister who is also a drug dealer and more than a little crazed about her father's death which she blames on the young man's mother, a purported art historian and expert on Arshile Gorky who does not seem to know much about the complex reasons for Gorky suicide and blames it solely on what he witnessed in 1915.  (Gorky was ill and poor and his studio with many of his paintings in it had burned down shortly before he hanged himself.  By the way the scenes in which the young girl appears, full of rage and excoriating the mother, are wince-inducing.)  A father, who is also a custom's inspector, implausibly played by Christopher Plummer, who is deeply uncomfortable, it seems, with his son's homosexuality.  That son, who is as implausibly a guard at a museum which is showing the Gorky painting of himself and his mother (a key image in the movie) and prevents the young girl from slashing it with a pocket knife.  His lover, who is half Turkish, playing a Turk in great part among those responsible for the genocide who, in his, the actor's, real life, expresses the Turkish justification for what the Turks refuse to acknowledge as a genocide.  (That line between life and art, history and its portrayal, is blurry, you see.)  I could go on.  The movie piles one plot device upon another all in search of some deep meanings which get more and more muddled as the movie progresses.  Arafat has so many themes running through it that the important one often gets lost in the thematic mayhem.

There's something despicable about this film.  The same sort of overbearing pretentiousness and ethical confusions undermined The Sweet Hereafter as well.  One of the many problems in Arafat is the way it uses people either to give lectures on the genocide that don't sound at all like dialogue or to turn them into allegorical figures, as the movie itself abuses Arshile Gorky by turning him into an image (as well as an image maker) it uses to make points.  That is, it disregards any sense of characters and how they might in certain circumstances actually behave in order to lecture its audience.  In this way, reality in the film is continually cheapened, including the genocide itself.  The film pays at lot more attention to itself than it does to the genocide and is in this sense appallingly self-serving.

It also often makes little or no sense.  I don't want to spoil the plot too much.  But one does wonder how the young man with his films cans full of heroin ever made it through Turkish customs which are famously careful to such abuses.  And one also wonders how the custom's inspector, before his unbelievable reconciliation scene with his son at the film's conclusion, was able to dispose of so much dope without its and his being discovered.  This is a movie, though, that despite all its pretenses toward profound thoughts cannot bear much scrutiny.  The more complex it becomes the more absurd it is.

That is more than too bad.  The Armenian genocide of 1915 happened.  It is one of the great horrors of the last century.  But, like the Shoah, it must be thought about in art with great tact and sensitivity.  Perhaps, as some would claim about the Shoah, it is too terrible for art.  Perhaps.  But certainly a self-regarding, self-important, and preposterous film like Arafat is a betrayal of it.",1496534400,,3814,4.697289156626506
