884901,5,6304371772,"This tape is a must for any Korn fan. I recommend it mainly b/c it shows you who the boys are. If you just sit back and watch the videos and judge these guys, you won't fully appreciate the music. I'd seen only one of the videos on here before and that was Blind. But after seeing this I can say that now I've seen all of the Korn videos. The best music video is Clown. but its the only one edited.
this will make you laugh so hard. The spit fight is classic and the way they just act around each other. Anyone that says these guys are sellouts, is greatly wrong. They're just having fun. something most bands don't do anymore.",1031011200,,627,4.105691056910569
884902,5,6304371772,"Ok First This Has Three Videos That You've Already Seen Videos, Clown, Blind, And Shoots And Ladders Then It Has One Prviously Unreleased Faget. All Great Videos Done With Little Money. Shows You Dont Have To Be A MTV Whore To Make Good Videos. Then Non-Stop Interviews With KoRn Showing How They Act In Everyday Life. Alot Of Fighting Between The Band And Drinking Beer.",1000252800,,371,4.723076923076923
884903,5,6304371772,"This video is ausome for any KoRn fan. It gives a lot of information as to what certain songs mean, and why Jonathan wrote them. You also get to see how passionately Jonathan sings, as well as some concert footage and music videos of Faget, Blind, Clown, and Shoots and Ladders. It's a video all about KoRn, right after their 2nd CD (Life is Peachy), came out. It's god a lot of hardcore old school stuff on it, it will flare up that fire that you felt when you first got into KoRn. It will make you kill to see them in concert. It's only about 18 bucks after shipping, well worth it to see the roots of the legendary, KoRn.",995241600,,624,4.1652892561983474
884904,5,6304371772,"This video is great. I love it because you get to know all about KoRn and every member. You also get to see the making of the Life is Peachy CD which is really cool, and you can see the videos for ""Blind"", ""Shoots and Ladders"", ""Clown"", and ""Faget"". Most of the music videos aren't very impressive, but it's great to see how KoRn first started out. The video for ""Clown"", though, is one of the best KoRn videos ever and you should check it out. Buy this video right now or you'll hate yourself for the rest of your life!",992217600,3,520,4.158415841584159
884905,5,6304371772,"As other reviewers have stated, there are a few videos on this tape.  You get to see ""blind"", ""Clown"", ""Shoots & Ladders"" and ""Faget"".  For me, the videos are not that big a deal.  I like those songs, of course, but the videos are nothing special.
What's special is the simple but effective direction, where the filmmaker takes himself completely out of the equation and shows us the band as they coexist.  There are several funny moments, but also some amazing ones: where Jon is singing the middle section of ""Kill You"" in the studio and sobbing... where Fieldy is talking about the origins of the band when their parents drove one another to practice... Fieldy, when asked who his best friend in the band is, naming all four of this bandmates... a packed house at Irvine Meadows on their feet, chanting ""Korn!""... the list goes on, but I don't want to spoil it for you.
If you are a Korn fan, you have no excuse to not own this tape.  If you are not a big fan, this tape gives a great insight into the band and how they interact behind the scenes.",974160000,2,1050,4.391752577319588
884906,5,6304371772,"I tell you, band videos do not get any better than Who Then Now. Welcome to the Neighborhood? No thanks. The video is basically a 45 minute long interview/documentary on the making of Life is Peachy, which I find very interesting considering it is one of my favorite CD's of all time.
Who Then Now probes into the personalities of all the members of Korn. The studio scenes with Jon show how much effort and emotion he put into that CD. Fieldy can get annoying as usual with his ""look at me, I'm funny"" persona, but it is standable.  Head is probably the most interesting person in the band, judging by this video, and spends 95% of it drunk. Who Then Now? also includes four music videos: ""Blind"" ""Shoots and Ladders"" ""Clown"" and the un-released ""Faget."" The videos are the same edited versions you see on MTV, but they are the great Korn videos themselves. Another high-point of this video was the part where they brought in Chino Moreno of the Deftones to cover Ice Cube's ""Wicked,"" which still makes me sad that Korn and 'Tones relationship is practically dead. The rest of this video is basically drinking Coors Light and spitting beer nuts at each other, typical Korn fashion, you know. You cannot call yourself a Korn fan and not have this. This is a necessity to every Korn fan out there. I urge you to buy this.",973468800,7,1320,4.523012552301255
884907,5,6304371772,"This is one of the best movie i have! It shows how they first started out and showing them making there first album. and shows some of there videos like ""Blind"", ""Clown"", ""Shoots and Ladders"", and ""Faget"". I have never seen them videos until i got ""Who Then Now"". This video also tells about how Munky, Head and Fieldy got thier nicknames.
