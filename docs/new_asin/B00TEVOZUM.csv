8701403,4,B00TEVOZUM,"The 5th season takes awhile to get into gear, due to what happened in season 4.  After the first couple of episodes, there are some great episodes, particularly exploring the relationship of the sisters; and there are some so-so episodes, where you could tell that the writers were running out of ideas.

It is still funny, still emotionally gripping; and still with a fair amount of illicit sexual encounters, but without any nudity.

This show would be most appreciated by young adults; and it is inappropriate for children and teens.

As has been the case throughout this series (apart from series one), the extras are poorly miked and not very well done or thought out.",1480982400,,673,4.826086956521739
