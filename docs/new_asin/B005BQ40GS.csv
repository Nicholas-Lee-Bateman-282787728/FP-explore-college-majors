8464110,5,B005BQ40GS,"The book was better - this was updated, to make it relevant to todays kids apparently - I thought the acting of the kids was excellent, and the sets seemed fantastic - though it was pointed out that ""headquarters"" could have been closer to what the book described.
  Overall, I wish the book had been followed closer, but I was delighted to see one of my all-time favorite books of my youth on the screen. I was hoping they would make the 3rd movie they had promised -",1431216000,,468,4.306818181818182

8464113,4,B005BQ40GS,"""Skeleton Island"" is now available in Region 1 format -- why not ""Terror Castle"" as well? It's available in every other format. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!

I read all of these books as a kid, and seeing them on video is fun, even if they are different. I got to see ""Terror Castle"" once on television, and it was good enough that I want to own a copy.

Please, please, PLEASE, put this out in Region 1 format, too!",1378512000,8,406,4.259740259740259
8464114,4,B005BQ40GS,"The Three Investigators book series was one of my favorites as a young reader so I was really happy when I heard there had been movie adaptations. This film is the second of the two that have been released. While the first one was released on DVD in the U.S., this one is only available in Region 2 so I watched this on a region free DVD player that I have. This film may have had a rough time getting released here because it's hard to decide the age rating for this film or what audience it was intended for.

PROS: Like the first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Investigators-Secret-of-Skeleton-Island/dp/B005OK0YPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Investigators & Secret of Skeleton Island</a>, this movie has a much higher production value that one would think these films would get. The cast is great and the boys are engaging, believable heroes. Many scenes are genuinely suspenseful, creepy and ""terror castle"" has all the fun sinister hallways, hidden passages, and intrigue that a haunted house should have.

CONS: Unlike the first movie which was Indiana Jones-lite, younger kid fun appropriate for ages 10+, this film is scarier and the girl that ""pursues"" Bob is beyond creepy, and the Sheriff's and the girl's dialogue is not appropriate for younger kids.

That said, I think ""Terror Castle"" is a fun way to spend an afternoon and it's too bad that it looks like they won't be making more Three Investigators films.",1374969600,2,1484,5.226890756302521
8464115,5,B005BQ40GS,"Been waiting for 5 years to get well worth the wait. Only available in region 4 DVD players so beware, may need to buy a program to change region in DVD player. Must be 2009 or earlier to get the code to change region. The movie itself is like the previous one but much harder to solve, so you may need pen and paper.",1364774400,,317,3.96875
