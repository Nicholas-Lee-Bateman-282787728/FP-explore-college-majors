7949498,2,B00005Q2ZX,A very poorly made movie. Even Kim Coates couldn't. Help it.,1479686400,,60,4.545454545454546
7949499,3,B00005Q2ZX,"What can I say about this movie?  Disaster strikes the plane. Just because it is a full moon do not let the title distract you from the plot.  Some planes have mechanical problems. Some planes have snakes. Some planes have time travel problems. This one has - well watch and see.

This is a 2000 TV movie so it will have the standard 2000 TV movie actors. The lines are standard. We have the standard bad guys including Daniel Baldwin with his stoic face and the standard carrying person. Only this time she (Penelope Ann Miller) is not a discredited fringe scientist; she is just misplaced. Will the doomsayer passenger bet slapped like in ""Airplane"" or will he finally survive to annoy the world?

If you have some time to kill, add this to your standard disaster list.",1325376000,,771,4.565217391304348
7949500,3,B00005Q2ZX,"The first time I saw this movie was on HBO last week.  I checked out the program guide on screen, and it sounded like a decent movie.  I recorded it on my dvr.  Although it isn't a 4-5 star movie, it doesn't deserve the 1-2 star rating.  Sure there isn't the bloodshed, violence, gore, and action that most people are looking for.  Just how many movies out there are that believable anyway?  Although it lacks all of the elements that I listed, it is a decent movie.  It pales to many of the newer releases with action, and special effects.  I feel that it is a decent, but not good drama.  Whats missing in this movie is the usual foul language, violence, and gore that most people are so used to seeing in a movie.  Could this be the main reason this movie is raked over the coals by the reviewers? Do they consider the movie ""boring""?  Sure the movie lacks the excitement, suspense, and has a plot that may not appeal to most. It is still a decent movie.",1247529600,,957,4.261111111111111
7949501,4,B00005Q2ZX,"Killing Moon is another survival story.  I happen to like that sort of thing, so I thought it was very good.  It has some really good personal stories about the characters within the main story line of the film.  However it does have enough action to keep you from getting bored.  I think it has something for the man and the woman of the house.
The cover could be somewhat misleading.  It looks like the cover of a horror flick, but this is definately not a horror movie!",1083024000,,472,4.318181818181818
7949502,1,B00005Q2ZX,"I'm trying to think of what to say about this one and I just can't think of where to start. The plot is recycled bits of every other plane movie since ""Airport"" and the characters are stereotypical and politically correct. There isn't any action, it isn't scary, there's no real suspense, it's just overall a really lame movie.",1043280000,2,327,4.655172413793103
7949503,2,B00005Q2ZX,"I must say that I thought this movie would be good considering that Penelope Ann Miller and Daniel Baldwin were in it. Sadly, that was not the case. It was hard to get into at first, but the start of it shows us how the passengers start to get sick. An obnoxious passenger spawns instant hatred of everyone including the audience, a little girl demonstrates the innocence of youth, add a conveneint doctor and yes, a passenger who is also a pilot and you already have an unbelievable plot. They are on their way to Honolulu, when the virus carrier dies with several other passengers already showing signs of sickness. Somehow, Daniel Baldwin intercepts the distress calls and takes over the flight plan. Another mystifying occurence is how Penelope Miller gets called in. Apparently she works for the CDC in California, but she doesn't contact the CDC headquarters,which is in Atlanta, once during the the course of the movie. She allows Daniel to boss her around, yell, and ultimately act like he is the president and not once did she try to call her headquarters to make sure everything was in line. People are dropping like flies on the plane, Daniel is trying to cover up the infection by directing the demise of the passengers, and Penelope decides to buck him by helping them land. Horrible acting, badly delivered lines, and laughable visual effects is what makes this the B of B movies. The only reason I gave it 2 Stars is that the plot did have potential. Unfortunately someone dropped the ball when they edited it. My recommendation, don't even waste your time or money on this film.",1021161600,4,1594,4.7168458781362
