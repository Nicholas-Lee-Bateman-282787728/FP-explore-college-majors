286981,4,6300247945,"I don't suppose that Sir Paul thought that he was making a GREAT movie.  But in my opinion it is a movie well worth watching.  The music is, of course, excellent.  The Eleanor Rigby portion was worth the price of the  movie alone.  The drive through London at night was the best scenery of the  City that I have seen in any video. True, the backgound plot was some what  lacking.  Who cares.  It was entertaining and a joy to watch.",928800000,2,432,4.234567901234568
286982,1,6300247945,"A rather deplorable film, less a movie than a rather damning indictment of the egomaniac that is Paul McCartney.
Not content to be a musical superstar (and a former Beatle at that), and perhaps the single most successful composer of the 20th century, McCartney has the gall to fancy himself a screenwriter and to express  outrage at those who dare to point out that filmmaking is not one of his  talents.  Sure, the music is great.  ""No More Lonely Nights"" may  well be the best love song he has written since the Beatles disbanded, and  McCartney even achieves a seemingly impossible task by offering a rendition  of ""Here, There, and Everywhere"" that is possibly superior to the  version he recorded with his fellow moptops on the ""Revolver""  album.
But this is NOT a movie.  It is merely a collection of music videos tied very loosely together by a ""plot"" that even the characters  show little interest in.  McCartney fans for whom ""Silly Love  Songs"" is a classic may not be able to find fault with the man's excruciating excursion into the cinema, but those who expect something more from someone so gifted have every right to be offended by something so  carelessly slapped together with only two possible goals:  to feed an ego  and make a buck.",928108800,5,1252,4.700460829493087

287111,4,6300247945,"it's a bummer to have to give a demerit to a Beatle, particularly the one i've always felt was the most talented. to say nothing of the fact that my second favorite Beatle is involved as well, so he'd have to charged with aiding and abetting.
what a RELIEF that this is yet another film who's bad reputation has been blown out of proportion.
okay so it's hardly Oscar-caliber material. okay, so we have an uneven screenplay which never quite makes up it's mind whether it's a lavish MGM-type musical or a suspenseful film noir. (you can see why Paul's second career as a screenwriter never materialized.) okay, so it's basically a film by Paul McCartney about Paul McCartney. so what? not unlike silly love songs, what's wrong with that?
at the very least, you'll have to admit that it does what it does right. it's a film about Paul McCartney, centering on the world and business he would know. i don't know if he was ever tempted to try to stretch himself, to try to play a doctor or a superhero or a Shakespearean character, but if he was, reason prevailed. the film showcases Paul McCartney doing what Paul McCartney does. and let's face it, that's exactly what his fans would want from the movie. (indeed, it's been suggested that he should've dispensed with his attempt at a story and simply filmed a documentary about a day in the life of Paul McCartney, since that's what it ultimately feels like.)
although ironically, that's just what gives the film such a bloody nose. it's so blatantly a vanity project. a longtime film buff, some of Paul's favorite times as a Beatle were the filming of A Hard Day's Night and Help! he even had a grand ol' time making what would be declared The Beatles' darkest hour, the Magical Mystery Tour telefilm. turns out he'd been trying to find a way back into cinema since he and Linda formed Wings. when the quest turned out to outlast the band itself, Paul took it upon himself to write a screenplay. and alas, yes, all this shows. maybe it doesn't consciously flaunt it's vanity-projectness so much as just sort of shrug it off, but either way you can't miss it.
the story (such as it is) involves contractual obligations concerning the album he's currently working on. an ex-con employee he took a chance on has disappeared, and so have the master-tapes to the new album. failure to recover them could cost him more than a few royalties: he's gotten somehow embroiled with a ruthless industrialist, and without the new record's revenue he could lose control of his own company.
so straightforward and/or simplistic is the plot, in fact, that it was easily converted to a promotional video game!
the narrative admittedly finds itself at odds with the film's two goals. we find Paul learning about the loss and suspicion falling upon said ex-con amidst recording sessions and even filming a couple music videos. (although i daresay this glimpse must've been interesting to some in a world with no VH1, let alone Behind The Music.) the would-be mystery angle and the musical angle don't always quite mesh. the combination doesn't hit quite as many snags as you'd expect, but it's still not exactly seamless.
and then there's the lengthy dream sequence converting the plot into a Victoria melodrama. this sequence is a little off-putting at first, not least for coming out of nowhere, but it has some fun stylistic touches to justify it's presence.
what's most appealing is the bits that throw back his Fab Four heyday. like that ill-fated Magical Mystery Tour film of old, this film's imperfections aren't enough to hamper the music, which on the whole ranges from pretty good to wonderful. some might say it was indeed the film's saving grace, given that the soundtrack album was the commercial success that film wasn't.
personally, though, i feel a little gypped that it's mostly recycled material. around the same time record companies had a sobering revelation: a greatest-hits package is basically for the casual fan or newcomer, since the rabid devotee will concentrate on the albums. so by the end of the decade it would be commonplace to use ""bonus"" new songs as a marketplace lure. ""No More Lonely Nights,"" being about the only song not to predate the movie, feels like it may well of been the inspiration for this custom.
it's also puzzling why he chose to revive some but not others. i mean, ""Hey Jude"" beats the hell out of ""The Long & Winding Road"" any day. but if nothing else, as already mentioned, the performances find our man ""Macca"" still in top form at his true calling.
also worth the trouble is the byplay between Paul and his drummer/best friend, Ringo. (George Harrison opted not to take part for some reason. my guess is that the three-year-old murder of John Lennon still stung, particularly as George didn't get a chance to mend fences. but of course i can only speculate.) their wives, Linda McCartney and Barbara ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" Bach, round out the quartet, sort of filling in for John and George. an impressive supporting cast was built - Bryan Brown, Tracey Ullman, Sir Ralph Richardson - even if the film doesn't always seem to know just what to do with them.
the film enough fun, in fact, that i hereby forgive it for what i would ordinarily consider the foremost heresy a film can commit. one of the things that most consistently irks me in movies is when the final reveal is a dream or other device meaning that the whole damn movie NEVER HAPPENED. at best it's just manipulative. at worst it cancels out of a film's potential. i've seen more than one film (most lamentably Jack Benny's infamous The Horn Blows At Midnight) which could've really been something if they'd gone all the way rather than reducing themselves to an anticlimax. it's a cop-out, pure an' simple.
it's hard to say why i'm not down on Broad Street for so copping out. i could be grading him on a curve since he was frankly in a little over his head. then again, maybe it just comes back to what i've been saying all along: this is a film by Paul McCartney about Paul McCartney. it's a serving of McCartneyness, with just a pinch of Ringoness for texture.
so in a nutshell, you'll like this film if you like The Beatles and/or Paul McCartney. even if you favor John or Ringo, you can hardly qualify as a Beatlemaniac without some appreciation for Paul's contribution.",1449273600,4,6323,4.68705035971223

287266,4,6300247945,"""Give My Regards To Broad Street"" is a nice little movie written by and starring Paul McCartney. Made in 1984 it is about how the master tapes for Paul newest album is missing and if it isn't found by midnight he will lose his music empire to a corporate take over. The story itself is rather predictable and it drags a bit here and there. Paul McCartney caught a lot of criticism from people on the writing of the film and as a result ""Broad Street"" didn't do well at the box office. Still I don't find it all that bad a movie. While it doesn't have the magic and charm that movies like ""A Hard Days Night"" or ""Help"" did it still has some decent moments.

What saves the movie is the music that is performed on here. A collection of McCartney compositions from both his Beatles days and with Wings. The movie almost plays like a long running music video as the music is spread out over the entire length of the film. They are updated versions of Paul's work so don't expect to hear the some old thing.  The music on here is so good I feel that the movie on its own is only three stars at best but the strength of the music pulls it up to four stars. Along with Paul also appearing in ""Broad Street"" is his late wife Linda McCartney, ex-Beatles band mate Ringo Starr and his wife Barbara Bach.

287297,4,6300247945,"The Received Wisdom is that this movie is an interminable, inexcusable exercise in vanity on the part of Paul McCartney.

Don't listen to that. It's a very likeable, sweet-natured, easygoing little comedy, with one of the finest soundtracks in the history of motion pictures.

The plot is widely misreported. The actual plot of the movie is as follows: Paul McCartney, as himself, is in the back seat of a Rolls Royce, stuck in traffic on the way to a meeting, and entertains himself with a daydream.

The main body of the movie is Paul's daydream, in which an ex-convict employee, entrusted by Paul to bring the master tapes of a new album, has disappeared with the tapes, and Paul, in the midst of a busy day of performances, rehearsals, interviews, jam sessions and business meetings, is trying to find man and recordings; if they're not recovered by midnight, Paul will lose his business and fortune. Over the course of this imagined day, Paul's imaginary self has daydreams of his own, which illustrate his fears that his employee has robbed him, and his concern for that worthy, his fears and sorry that having done so will ruin a life that was promisingly on the path toward rehabilitation.

Among the musical numbers and character bits, the relaxed comedy and gentle drama, emerges a surprisingly effective, moving core, as Paul struggles to keep his faith in his hireling, as all the forces around him, including his own common sense, pressure him against it.

This will never go down in history as a great movie, nor should it. But it's a worthy successor to ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""HELP!"" a movie that would sit comfortably among those two films, or the classic Ealing comedies.",1326585600,4,1691,4.797250859106529

Paul is on his way to work one morning when he gets a call from his manager Bryan Brown. Paul had entrusted the master tapes of his new album to an ex-crim whom he was giving a second chance, and now they have both gone missing! And if they don't find the tapes by midnight, that leaves the way open for their company to be taken over by the nasty Wrath-Bone industries.
Paul tries to go about his normal day; recording Yesterday, making videos, rehearsing. But by the end of the day, the stress has got to him and he begins hallucinating. So he pops in on his old mate Ralph Richardson for tea and surrealism. But will he be able to save his tapes, his friend, his company and his faith in human nature before he wakes up and realises it was all a dream?

As a piece of cinema, Paul's grand folly of the 80s is abysmal, but if you regard it as a 100 minute video clip for an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/album/dp/B00000721H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">album</a>&nbsp;that really isn't as bad as you've heard, then it's a perfectly entertaining piece of fluff. In fact, if he had handed it directly to MTV instead of attempting a cinema release, it would probably be remembered a lot more fondly. Occasionally veering into ""so bad it's good"" territory, you will marvel at some of the woeful performances by what, in any other movie, would have been a very good cast. Watch for some gloriously camp overacting by a sound engineer.

If there's one area where Broad Street doesn't disappoint, it's the camera work. The film is beautifully photographed and this double sided disc has both the wide-screen and the 4:3 full-screen versions. The sound is listed as Dolby 4.0. It's a curious mix. Basically it's stereo, with the lead vocal in the centre channel and very sparing use of the rear channel. Rather than doing two separate transfers of the movie, they might have been better off putting the extra effort into a proper 5.1 mix. Still, it does provide another level of misguided eightiesness to the whole thing.
Two trailers provide the extras.

287335,5,6300247945,"I never seen this movie by Sir Paul until tonight (Dec 2010). When it came out in 1984 it had the most Horrible reviews and was considered a complete Bomb.
For years I been wanting to see this movie and stumbled onto the DVD last week (I didn't even know it had been released on DVD).
It's funny how critics will marvel at the Beatles ""Hard days Night"" and ""Help"" movies yet dish this one. I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable and loved every minute of it.
To See Ringo in the supporting role and a cameo by Sir George Martin in thsi movie certainly gave it a Beatle like atmosphere to it.
(Linda McCartney was very much in the film as well).
You are FLOODED with so many GREAT production numbers, those alone are worth the purchase price. Paul and Ringo perform Ball Room Dancing, So Bad, a Beatles medley, other musical numbers are: No More Lonely Nights, Silly Love Songs, Eleanor Rigby(with a brand new written extended Orchestra number to it written by Paul).
There is a flimsy story line of the film where a employee of Paul's comes up missing and was to deliver the master tapes of a brand new album, if they cannot locate the tapes for delivery to the Factory, then a loan-shark gets control of the company and will bankrupt Paul. It's enjoyable to follow along and keeps the flim going forward. There are many ""dream"" scenes that I really enjoyed. Time has aged this Movie EXTREMELY well! It's sad that George Harrison didn't have a cameo in it, seeing it was just 3 years or so after John's death, it would have really cemented this film as a true classic.  I think this movie should be aired once a year like the ""Wizard of Oz"" or any classical movie. Kids will love this light-hearted film and the songs are just great!
This style of movie just isn't made any more. It's made in the classic style of Musical's, a lost art form for sure.
I 100% loved this movie and could sit back down and watch it again (I prob will in a few days, if not just for some of the songs).
This DVD doesn't have 5.1 sound, but it does have 4.0 surround sound and comes through very well in my 5.1 system, The mixes on the songs are great, great fidelity and separation of instruments.
Buy this and you will enjoy this McCartney-Ringo classic!",1292284800,2,2240,4.371702637889689

Looking to go Ballroom Dancing !

287337,1,6300247945,"In this odd and very bad movie, we see Paul McCartney as he goes about an average day of appointments, all the time trying to find  the missing and irreplaceable master tapes for his next album.  We see him rehearse and perform some Beatles and Wings songs with Ringo on drums and wife Linda doing whatever it was she did.  His search for the tapes includes many dream sequences and even a pointless and embarrassing visit with his deceased father in the person of the late Sir Ralph Richardson.

The movie is a confusing and dreary mishmash of reality, drama, and music videos created by screenwriter and star McCartney.  Sadly it is  depressing and boring, completely devoid of life and energy.  The most that can be said about Paul's 'performance' is that he had the good taste to look completely disinterested and uninvolved; despite the threatened take-over of his company if the tapes cannot be found, he maintains a glum pokerface as does the rest of the cast.  I didn't care about the plot because he didn't seem to care.  This must have been his attempt to make a cinema vrit film similar to ""A Hard Day's Night,"" but he wanders from place to place like a sleepy zombie.  Wife Linda is seen but never mentioned nor does she speak, and Ringo's wife plays a journalist who just hangs around and stares at Ringo.

This project must have looked much better on paper and I'm sure McCartney thought this would show him as a sensitive actor and artiste; unfortunately, we see just the opposite - a man who can afford to star in his own movie even if it's a waste of time.",1282694400,3,1573,4.522968197879859

287360,4,6300247945,"Non Spoiler Review:

A thoroughly enjoyable movie for a number of reasons. There are fun intentional gags in the style of the Beatle's Help. There are unintentionally funny parts in which physics and McCartney's acting skills are challenged. Written by Paul McCartney of Beatles and Wings fame himself, or was it by McCney? That is the question. An art movie? A comedy? A light fantasy? A personal journey of introspection for him, or a revelation of such to us? I believe it is a combination of all of the above.
There's no doubt about the artistry of the music, and visuals accompanying them. With Sir Paul that's pretty much a given. This movie can easily be touted as a bona fide collection of videos, whether one likes the scripted parts in between or not. He and the studio didn't skimp on the musical sequences, which come fast and furious for those wading impatiently through the admittedly and intentionally silly plot. Now how about artistry in the script writing? I believe there actually is some, despite McCartney's lack of experience. Smooth and clever fades into different scenes, touching moments, wit and humour. It's too bad he didn't have some collaboration with an experienced script writer to polish some of the dialogue, and a film director who caught and re-shot the badly acted parts. This could perhaps have been a great movie instead of a really fun one.
The comedy is silly, just plain fun. It often features Ringo, a wonderful addition to this post Beatles McCartney project.
The plot is not technically fantasy, but slips into that genre through dream sequences, often beautifully done. A scene with a ghost Linda McCartney on a gorgeous horse is eerie now that she's passed away from cancer.
One of my favourite aspects of the film is what seems to be a connection to painful events in McCartney's life of that time period. He picked up his pen for this in another down phase of his career, brought on by the double whammy in 1980 of a pot related jail term in Japan pulling the plug on his Wings band, then the shooting death of his still close friend John Lennon. Considering his comment to an interview that he ""wrote it for his sins"" and one of the main characters being an ex-con who may really be a good guy, and the first scene with Paul being of him writing ""Not such a Bad Boy, "" and his choice of other songs, I believe he had a message to send with the film.
I really enjoyed this, but in the end, it's up to each individual to decide if this movie puts the art in McCartney or not.",1264982400,,2523,4.569536423841059
287361,5,6300247945,"This DVD offers a lot of insight into Paul McCartney from his own perspective.  The premise is a day in the life of Paul McCartney with music from the Lennon and McCartney days, Paul McCartney and Wings, and music of his own.  The movie was released in 1984.

There's a mystery story wrapped with fantasy and reality of the single most successful Beatle.  Paul reveals aspects of the industry seldom seen and even a introspective view of himself, playing 'Yesterday' as a street musician, playing only for tips.  If you're a Beatles or McCartney fan, this movie is perfect for you.  If you want to learn about Paul McCartney, this is a good insight into how he views himself.

287363,3,6300247945,"McCartney attempted to make a movie that combined the immediacy of Let It Be, the day in the life theme of A Hard Days' Night, the adventure of Help!, and the whimsy of Magical Mystery Tour, with mixed results. As movie producer, screen-writer, starring actor, music producer/arranger, music writer/composer, singer/musician, and whatever else, McCartney seems to have taken on too much, which is initially obvious in his deadpan (but not awful) acting. The movie actually has a nice plot, with several subplots, and an uplifting theme, with several nice sub-themes. But McCartney should have thought up a better scenario than Harry getting accidently locked in the rest room with McCartney's valuable master tapes. Maybe he should have had Mr. Bean get on the wrong train and wind up in Moscow with the tapes, or something. But there are some great actors, and musicians, making appearances in the movie. And the music videos, which constitute about 80% of the movie anyway, are terrific. This is a great long-form music video, even if only a fair feature film.",1244764800,,1062,5.0397727272727275

Lacking the pretentious joylessness of the Wall or the over the top dramatics of Tommy, it is a romp through the music of Sir Paul. The same Paul McCartney that masterminded the Magical Mystery Tour (which I also love) gave us Broadstreet in '84.  The plot has the depth you would find in an Elvis movie and stands more as a long music video than a film, but what a video.  Eleanor Rigby is elongated with the orchestral Eleanor's Dream which is my favorite segment.  It is a dreamy look at Edwardian London with well written orchestration and a bit of violence that keeps it from being too sweet.

287368,2,6300247945,"Well, I'm not really sure what to say on this review that hasn't already been said, but as a McCartney fan, I'll try and give the most objective review of this film that I can.

I am a huge Paul McCartney Fan. I own every album down to the obscure ""Fireman"" albums... and even for me, this movie is very bizarre and hard to swallow. In a way, it's an enlongated music video with poor acting and a boring plot to boot. It's an uneven hodge-podge of 1980's music video montages and a weak plot trying but failing to put them all together.

Plot aside, the actual 'problem the movie has is the fact that all the sequences, fashions, and production value of the film and music is that it's extremely outdated. We all know that a music films saving graces are never the plot, but the memorable music scenes that are viewed and replayed for years and years after the film is released.. Unfortunately this film doesn't even have THAT going for it. I'm not saying the songs for the film were a poor choice because, lets face it, the whole premise of the movie is centered around Mr. McCartney.... The problem is that the songs themselves (re-recorded works of Beatles, Wings, McCartney solo, and new songs) were recorded and produced with those terrible 1980's production values. Add on top some very cheesy 80's montages and fashions and the movie comes off now and even then as a product that was chasing the pop culture of the time... Lets face it, we all know no matter what situation something like that very rarely stands the test of time in the end.

The final product comes off as an outdated attempt to make an actual 'film'. I applaud Paul of course for trying something different, but the ending product didn't quite measure up to something to stand the test of time. ""Broad Street"", to me, is simply a work from my favorite artists catalogue that provided something out of the ordinary. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm not saying it's brilliant... I'm simply saying it's something that is now part of Paul McCartney's history that gave him a vehicle to try something different.

For the collectors, buy the film... but definitely don't expect something earth-shattering... It'

I  became a Beatle fan in 1964, and I was glad that Paul went back into `his'
catalogue to remake some of his timeless classics: ""Yesterday"", ""Here, There Everywhere"", ""The Long and Winding Road""  (and others) on this collection .
My daughter is now 15, and a full fledged fan of McCartney . The family was lucky to see Paul  display that he still has the energy and love for what he does, as he ran down a play list of about 34 great songs, at Madison Square Garden on 9/30/05.  I was then  thrilled to find this DVD available online to continue that  (Paul) show at home.

The plot is a variation of `24' as we see Paul go through a day in his life going from appointment to appointment - all linked by studio performances
Filmed up close and personal with Paul and his band. It is a Neat Time Capsule of Timeless Music that will continue to be discovered and re-discovered as time goes by.

The extended version of Eleanor Rigby with Paul, Linda, Ringo, Barbara (Bach) and others has a look of Dickens England as Paul daydreams with the soundtrack sounding very classical and sophisticated with layers of strings complimenting Paul's acoustic 6 string.

For No One is a treat as we see Pail, finger-pick  the notes of this sad song that has became one of my favorites over the years. I had a tear in my eye hearing it live a few weeks ago.

As some of the other reviewers have said, he should have hired an experienced screen writer instead of trying to write it himself. Also, all new music instead of re-works might have been better. Nonetheless, it is a must for Beatle and McCartney fans, as it functions as an extended music video. Also, with DVD format, one can skip to the good parts. Indeed, as one other viewer noted, it took another five years, with the arrival of the Flowers in the Dirt CD and the Get Back tour of 1989-1990 for Paul to regain critics and fans. But this failure may have taught Paul a lesson- after this, he was more willing to collaborate with others, such as Eric Stewart and Steve Miller, and of course, his brilliant work with Elvis Costello, such as Veronica and My Brave Face. IN spite of it being one of Paul's failings, I would still recommend it to fans, it is always fun to watch Paul perform his music, and the three original tunes are fantastic.",1119916800,2,1035,4.424083769633508

It has more storyline than ""Magical Mystery Tour"". But it's basically a caper musical at a time when musical films were very few and far between, and didn't interest people all that much anymore.

As a film, it's pleasant and light enough, safe for kids to watch, the type of film to watch when there's nothing on TV, what I call a ""Sunday afternoon"" type of movie.

It looks and sounds good, but the package is no-frills. McCartney's commentary would've added something to it at least.

287422,2,6300247945,"Just as with 'Magical Mystery Tour,' you would be better off buying the soundtrack CD instead. Watch this film, and run the risk of lowering your opinion of Paul McCartney.

On the soundtrack CD (and the film), Paul revisits several Beatles ballads with Ringo Starr's input and the production skills of George Martin. Paul also provides remakes of a few Wings hits. 'No More Lonely Nights' was one of McCartney's last bonafide hits, and can be heard near the end of the movie. The music is pleasant enough, and Paul gets to stretch a bit by composing some quasi-classical incidental music. Again, nice work.

Unfortunately, this isn't a documentary about the making of a McCartney album. It's a ridiculous drama about one of Paul's (fictitious) roadies stealing the master tapes of the latest McCartney album, and Paul's valiant attempts to a)keep faith in the friend who let him down and b) get the tapes back. While watching this film, you'll realise exactly why Richard Lester focused the plots of 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'Help!' on Ringo - Paul simply can't act very convincingly. He's self-conscious and it shows. The very dated 80s atmosphere only hurts more.

Two big mistakes McCartney made with this project:  1) re-recording old songs (including a half-dozen Beatle tunes), instead of writing all new material (only three new songs were used) 2) writing the screenplay himself, instead of hiring an experienced screenwriter to flesh out his idea.
I can't think of a reason why a non-McCartney fan would want to watch this.  If you are a fan, then there's worse ways to spend a couple hours.  But really, it's hard to say anything specifically good about this movie.  It's hard for me to believe that Macca never realized that the story was so under-developed and unimaginative.  For such a creative person, he seems to have set out write the most boring story he could.  That's why I consider it a mistake to use old songs-- he could've at least let the movie coast along on the strength of all new material.

At the same time it is just as ridiculous to give this 1 star. The dreck that is ""Lennon-the Messenger"" or ""Beatles Big Beat Box"" are 1 star DVDs. Broadstreet is much better than those. The saving grace of this film is having Paul and Ringo together playing music, and in the beautiful fantasy dream segment. Those moments alone make this worth owning.

However,it remains puzzling why the lynch-mob fervor to rip apart Paul McCartney's comparatively small, independent feature ""Give My Regards To Broad Street"" seems to continue unabated 20 years after its release. If this tuneful, good-natured post card from McCartney to his fans offends you, then you walked into the wrong multiplex, because this film was not made for you. Sure, it's a vanity project, but that has become a rather hackneyed criticism. Doesn't anyone remember another ""vanity project"" from another rock star that was also released around the same time- ""Purple Rain""? Can you say that movie (entertaining as it was) had any more of a ""plot"" than ""Broad Street""? For that matter, how about ANY Elvis movie ever made-any 'plot' points were just lead-ins to the musical numbers, which is all the fans really were paying to see. At any rate, McCartney fans will love the music, which is plentiful. McCartney has some real top flight players backing him up, with appearances from Dave Edmunds, Chris Spedding, John-Paul Jones, Eric Stewart (of 10cc) and an off-camera David Gilmour, who contributed that memorably soaring guitar solo on ""No More Lonely Nights"".

287462,4,6300247945,"(...) It is nice that Paul and/or Fox decided to release this one onto DVD. It's amazing it has been 20 years since the film was released.
First of all, the DVD contains both widescreen and full screen formats (Hint, the widescreen format is on the side with the writing in the center of the disc).
The picture looks much cleaner than the VHS version. It brings a crispness to all the scenes. The sound is better on the musical numbers than the dialog. Still, the dialog is audible. It's great to now have the ability to skip to a favorite scene (the warehouse scene being my favorite).
The extras are only the domestic and international trailers for the film (obviously, both are in english). This is where I deduct 1 star. Paul could have included the making of Broadstreet documentary. It aired in the UK around the time of the film's release there. Also, some sort of commentary would have been nice. At the very least, the video for the single No More Lonely Nights would have been great to include. Perhaps some stills from the movie as well.
Some other interesting facts are that this starred Tracy Ullman (who would later go on to host her own show on Fox--which would feature a then little known cartoon called the Simpsons), Bryan Brown (would go on to star in the smash film F/X, and co star in Coctail, with Tom Cruise). Look for John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin in the Ballroom Dancing sequence, and Dave Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) provided the blistering guitar solo heard in No More Lonely Nights. Also, it is good to see Paul and Ringo together. We get to see Linda again, as well.
Over all, I would recommend this one for McCartney and Beatles fans. Glad to have it in my collection. Now Paul, how about releasing Rockshow and a video collection spanning 1970-present onto DVD? There are plenty of fans waiting for those as well.",1083369600,6,1842,4.534534534534535

This film has had a dismal reputation from the moment of its 1984 release--and even probably before that.  I won't say this mystifies me exactly (considering John's tragic death and Paul's domestic squareness), but I do think it's unjustified.

The acting, directing, and the storyline are more or less what anyone ought to expect for a B grade music film, and are certainly no worse than that of, say, the Beatles' film Help!, and rather better than The Magical Mystery Tour.  Moreover, the music and the cinematography are very fine.  So, it looks good, and it works something like a string of music videos and performances interspersed with something like a plot, each (music and story) in about equal measure.  As for Silly Love Songs, surely the time has come to look more forgivingly on mid-80s tastes in pop culture.

In short, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the film.  The DVD looks good and sounds fine.  The extras, however, are almost nil, which is a shame, since there was so much promotional material at the time of original release.  Perhaps the McCartney camp (or Fox) has learned how to better play the expectations-game since 1984: if you overhype a mediocre project, everyone will be disappointed (some bitterly so!); but if expectations are low, maybe, just maybe, everyone will enjoy themselves a little better.

His bandmate John had been murdered in 1980 and quickly attaining saint-like status while he was still around creating sappy music,lacking any real purpose and getting old.  In this film,  Paul wants to remind the world that HE was the one who wrote Yesterday and Here, There and Everywhere...though nothing he had written since could match the beauty those songs.  The best he could do now was the mediocre and forgettable ""No More Lonely Nights"" and ""So Bad.""  He wants to remind the world that HE was the cute one and can still be cute if you look closely...so he dresses up with wife, Ringo and Barbara Bach in Victorian outfits for no explicable reason other than he wants to play dress up in a ""dream sequence."" There is a scene in the film where an interviewer asks him if he ""writes his own songs"" (as if we didn't know).  But it's all part of the reminder. Here we have a witless, vapid, lamebrained, shallow, mindless plot about tapes gone missing.  ""Poor"" Paul! His gazillion dollar music empire will fall to its feet if ""Harry"" doesn't recover his master tapes.

Are we supposed to feel sorry for Paul?  Are we supposed to be worried, as he is in the film, that he'll end up homeless and penniless in the London underground playing ""Yesterday"" to passerbys?  Ego, anyone?  Given the critical homeless situation that existed in the 80's how can he even suggest that?  How can anyone in his right mind say this was not a McCartney ""vanity project?"" The wit and comedy in this film is best exemplified by having ""Good Day Sunshine"" played over the rainy English skies (what irony!)  You must remember that it was Paul who masterminded that Beatles debacle -""Magical Mystery Tour.""  At least he could blame the drugs for that one.

It is rather pathetic to see these 40 something rockers trying to find some purpose in the middle of the 1980's.  It's telling that even though John and George matured with age and got a little wiser (George, especially with his dark sense of humor) Paul is still clueless, hoping to capitalize on whatever boyish grins he has left without much depth or insight.  Paul was never good at irony, but if he had displayed just a bit if it here, or a little self-deprecation, this film might have worked.  I think of the Rutles and what a brilliant satire that was.  But Paul's sense of self-importance is so that it makes him unlikeable.  This film shows a megalomaniac, aging rock star obsessed with money and insecure about his place in the music world.  Amazing that ""Sir"" Paul, a man whose band personified the 60's counterculture has now become part of British aristocratic establishment. Another yawn.",1057622400,12,2715,4.675789473684211

Ringo it seems is a treat no matter where he goes or what he does, he should've had a bigger part with his simple few words to convey his point. :)  It was a good idea, but the movie just didn't carry through.  Paul should probably stick to his day job, but I'd like to see another go - and give Ringo some more screen time.  Poor Linda had barely a sentence to say in the movie.

""No More Lonely Nights"" is one of his best solo love songs, and it's music video persuaded me to buy this movie.

287480,4,6300247945,"The star of this movie, panned as a vanity project by McCartney by a certain Leonard Maltin, is not only McCartney but the music, which is a mixture of Beatles songs, Wings songs, and solo McCartney, both old and new.
The plot, flimsy as it is, involves the loss of the master tapes to McCartney's latest album, which has already sold millions in advance copies.  Suspicion immediately falls upon Harry, a friend with a police record who has gone straight and whom Paul lends a hand by offering him a job.  If the tape is not recovered in 24 hours, businessmen who helped his record company during a cash flow crisis will take over, leaving him broke.  Trouble is, Harry's gone missing, and he might have taken it to the notorious bootlegger Big Bob for a lot of lolly.  The movie also is a day in the life of Paul, with a hectic schedule of stage and radio appearances, recording, etc., but in this case, the creditors go around harassing Paul and company.
The medley of ""Yesterday/Here There And Everywhere/Wanderlust"" is a treat very early in the movie.  It's a nostalgic listen for Beatles fans and for the days when producer George Martin, who appears here, was like the fifth Beatle.  The scene features a funny scene where Ringo spends two-thirds of the medley time finding brushes.  He finally does and gets ready, only to find himself in time for ""Wanderlust,"" which needs drumsticks, which he already had in the first place.
The ""Ballroom Dancing"" number is about a trio of grammar school kids who play with each other.  They grow up as teenage toughs, the boys who fight over the girl.  The fight then spills over to the elegant ballroom dancers.  Chaos sets in as the dancers tussle with the toughs, knocking over bits of the stage in the process.  Audience members watching get alarmed, wondering, ""What's going on here?""  The fact that it was all staged, as one of the toughs gives a hand to one of the dancers, is somewhat of a joke.  Paul then calmly asks Linda, ""Lunch?"" after the calamity.
There's a funny scene in the BBC canteen when a man dressed in a hideously grotesque monster outfits scares someone nearby.  In fact there are others on their lunch break who appear to be working on some sci-fi show that isn't Doctor Who.
The rock set, ""Not Such A Bad Boy,"" ""So Bad,"" and ""No Values,"" are performed by the band including Dave Edmunds on guitar, and it's fun to see Barbara Bach, aka Ms. Starr, jamming out to the music while sitting down.
Hearing ""The Long And Winding Road"" in a version preferable to Paul made up my mind that this version is better than the Let It Be version.  A pensive Paul is driving down the road, while Linda, Ringo, and Barbara are anxiously waiting for word, and Sandra (Harry's wife) is sadly looking at a picture of her missing husband.
 The ""Eleanor's Dream"" daydream sequence involves an idyllic countryside and the cobblestones of a Dickensian England.  Linda is shown in a majestic sequence during her last bit in it.
A brief scene between Paul and Sir Ralph Richardson, the latter's penultimate movie appearance, is touching as well as illuminating of Paul's character in the movie.
Guest stars who help out are of course Richardson, Tracey Ullman as Sandra, and Bryan Brown as Paul's manager, but TV veteran John Bennett as the menacing Ratchett, pulls off the most effective performance, without saying a solitary word in the movie!  Now that's acting!

This film is pretty good for two reasons:
1.) For anyone who is a true Beatles fan.
2.) For anyone who just wants to watch McCartney go solo for  once.

The  appearance by Tracey Ulman is great fun, as is watching Paul McCartney beg  for money as a busker.  I could go on and on, but it boils down to this.  If you love Paul, then you'll probably love this movie.  If you don't love  Paul's music, then you should probably pass on this one.",959644800,6,704,4.68595041322314
287486,3,6300247945,"I remember loving this film when I was a kid.  I bought it a while ago and it felt like something was missing. Then I realized in my old age (23) what this was, the plot.  There is none!  But I guess that won't matter to hard  core McCartney fans (like me) anyway. I love Paul but i cant give this very  average film 5 stars based on that alone.  Great songs, especially the No  Values and Not such a Bad boy warehouse rehearsal segment and the Eleanor  Rigby sequences alone justify owning this film.  Broad Street captures  McCartney during my favorite and very much underrated post-Wings McCartney  period (1980-86).  Except for a few music videos its hard to find lengthy  filmed examples of Paul during this time (at least that are commercially  available) so this justifies it for me.  Kudos to Paul for sticking with  his own screenplay instead of selling out and taking a more  ""commercial"" screenplay from a famous British playwright ( i  forget his name) just to make money.  Arrogance? Ego?  Perhaps, but these  are the signs of a TRUE artist.  A good, light hearted fun film with great  music, although there should be a label on the box stating ""For  McCartney fans Only""",955929600,,1184,4.581730769230769
287487,3,6300247945,"Okay, it's a silly vanity production.  Paul McCartney playing a fictional character named Paul McCartney who happens to be a rock star who wrote songs called ""Good Day Sunshine,"" ""Yesterday,""  ""Here, There and Everywhere,"" etc., and who works with a drummer,  played by Ringo Starr, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the real Ringo  Starr.  Let's also hire Paul's wife and a handful of real actors (Ralph  Richardson in one of his last roles!) and call it a movie!  Yes, it's all a  bit embarrassing.
But thanks to Mr. McCartney, George Martin, and some  fine musicians, the musical interludes are superb.  Even if you have the  soundtrack CD, buy the movie for the visuals to accompany the music.  On  that count, no McCartney fan will be disappointed.",951523200,7,755,4.850393700787402
287488,5,6300247945,"It is an enormous shame that Siskel and Ebert were unable to understand the plot of this film. It was simply too intelligent and gentle for them to grasp. But anyone who is literate should be able to understand the contrast  between the hero's workaday life and the melodramatic horrors he imagines  when the master tape for a new album goes missing.  The plot is about  resisting the temptation to condemn your friend on circumstantial evidence,  and the determination to trust your own judgment. It is about believing the  best of people rather than the worst, and about the human capacity to  overcome the terrors that the imagination throws at you, and insist that  reason and fairness prevail.  It is a very coherent plot used to structure  a series of beautifully staged musical interludes.  Besides being full  McCartney-Martin music, it has much to say to a culture drunk on speed,  violence, and sloppy judgment.  It is not really a small film at all,  but a sort of musician-as-auteur cinematic essay that deserves to be  listened to in several senses of that word. Visually beautiful,  intellectually satisfying, musically a recurring joy.",949536000,16,1150,4.968421052631579
287489,2,6300247945,"Your new album is due at the record company but the messenger carrying the master tapes is missing.  What do you do?  Why, sing a few numbers, of course!  Sure, Paul McCartney's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET basically  kills time between songs.  And melody master Paul McCartney turns in a  wooden performance, although that kind of acting hasn't stopped Keanu  Reeves, to name one stiff actor, from a movie career.  But what great  songs! How did McCartney choose from so many superb Beatles and solo tunes  he had composed?  GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET's at least worth a look  on cable TV.",937872000,,598,4.644230769230769

However:
This 'printing' is awful. It is an inferior product. It is advertised as both widescreen and fullscreen, yet both copies of the film on the disc I received are fullscreen, which is useless.
My advice is to shop elsewhere. Also: the 'next day service' Amazon promised me turned into 3 days. 3 not 1. Amazon: do not promise what you are not capable of delivering.",1514160000,,512,4.457446808510638
