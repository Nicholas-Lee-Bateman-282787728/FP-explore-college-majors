2669939,5,B000JCF2Z2,"The producers did an excellent job presenting John of God and the Casa de Dom Inacio (John of God's sanctuary in Brazil). So many of the other videos available concentrate on the more sensational aspects of the Casa -- namely, the visible surgeries -- and miss the bigger picture of what is really going on there: spiritual healing and all that implies. And this film is the only one that addresses the very important subject of obsession by negative entities, which I thought the narrator explained very clearly to Western viewers.

This film also does a very good job of explaining the basics of the Casa to those not familiar with it. The addition of a just a little extra information would make this the perfect comprehensive introduction to the Casa -- just a minute or two more about the visible surgeries (the forms they commonly take, the fact that there is little or no pain and no infection) and also a little more about the invisible surgeries (the fact that sometimes when people go home their doctors find internal stitches, that people need at least 24 hours to physically recuperate from these surgeries which demonstrates the physical reality of these invisible procedures, etc.). The choice of music was great throughout the film and set the right tone.

I especially liked the footage of Dorothy Cooke, whom I was privileged to meet at the Casa. I was pleased that one of the hiden treasures of the Casa got this attention. Everything she said about the Casa and about spiritual life was expressed so clearly, straightforwardly, and with the strength of personal realization.",1161216000,20,1593,4.852941176470588
2669940,5,B000JCF2Z2,"This tribute to John of God is beautiful beyond words.  The loving spirit of the Casa de Dom Inacio swept through me as the viewer, just as it did the first time I saw John of God.  If it is possible to have captured the energy of a place and translate it into something a person can feel personally and viscerally, you have surely done that.  I wept for joy - the film was like coming home.  I love that it conveys John's message so clearly - that it is indeed God who heals, and that he heals through the giving of a community.  I love that it offers a simple education of what really occurs in the human energy field when spiritual healing is taking place, and the nature of unseen entities in a way that is easily understood and accepted.  More than anything, I love how clearly you have conveyed our human potential to be loving and whole independent of our circumstances; that we are indeed infinite.  I am certain that this film is being held in the loving embrace of all those seen and unseen who make up the Casa de Dom Inacio.

Unlike some of the DVDs made of John of God that focus on sensationalism, this one shows the gentle, loving side of John and the healing work at the Casa in Brazil. I'm particularly pleased that Dorothy Cooke, a medium at the Casa, was given time to express her views and what she has observed in her years of service there.  I highly recommend this DVD.  The seller is great too.",1428710400,,453,4.255813953488372

8149928,5,B000JCF2Z2,"This was an excellent video save for 1 thing--it is too short!  Needs to be longer.  The content is excellent for ANYONE considering going to Brazil to see this man.  It depicts a true account of the work that goes on at the Casa, shows the environment and grounds, explains what will go on--process and procedure.  It's wonderful! Item arrived timely and I would reccomend the seller to anyone and this video.

8149930,5,B000JCF2Z2,"I have viewed most of the videos about John of God and this one is the best. It is informative, professionally produced and heartwarming. It does not cover the specifics of visiting the Casa, so I would recommend reading one of the books on John of God for that.",1195171200,5,262,4.36734693877551
8149931,5,B000JCF2Z2,"It's difficult to continue to be skeptical about the healing abilities of the Brazilian known as John of God after watching this video.  There is simply too much sincerity and too much commitment evident in the testimonies of educated, intelligent, and otherwise credible people who have experienced or witnessed his gift of healing through psychic energy.

""I have come to the realization that there are beings in the next dimension - call them what you will - but there are beings who help mankind who are so compassionate that they actively assist people who have the gift of mediumship to direct energy into what is known as the etheric body, which is then reflected into the physical body and thus healing takes place,"" Johann Grobler, M.D. explains, adding that it is important to recognize that we are multi-dimensional beings.

Narrator Emma Bragdon, Ph. D. explains that John of God enters an altered state of consciousness and then channels various spirit entities, who do the healing.  One of them is St. Ignatius Loyola.  Occasionally, St. Francis of Assisi comes through, but most of the entities are names not known to the general public.  John of God is interviewed and gives all the credit to ""the good spirits.""  He says that St. Rita Cascia appeared to him at age nine ""in a cloud"" and gave him advance notice of a disaster about to happen in his village.  He has been the vehicle for healing by the spirits for more than 40 years.

The video shows people from many countries gathering at the serene settings of the Casa de Dom Inacio and going through the healing experience. Matthew Ireland talks about being cured of an inoperable brain tumor.  Diana Cortez, who overcame an eye disorder, says that she could feel entities all around her.  Dorothy Cooke, a clairvoyant medium who assists at the Casa, states that she can see spiritual beings sitting in the room as the healing takes place.

  I don't need to see it with my own eyes to believe it.  The eyes of the people interviewed said it for me. John of God is for real.",1166745600,15,2045,4.705056179775281
