He clearly discusses the features of essential pieces of equipment, and shows you how to keep them in tiptop order. They became so much easier to understand. He makes a serious subject a pleasure to learn, using a quiet humor in places (never overdone) to keep you alert and interested. I found this DVD and Mehlers on the table saw priceless.  Im no longer a beginner!",1510444800,,459,4.6419753086419755
8355289,1,B002806VOY,"WE ORDERED THIS DVD AND IT DID NOT WORK  WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS RECORDED ON 2 TRACKS.  THEN WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD PURCHASE CORDS ETC FROM RADIO SHACK TO MAKE IT WORK  WHEN I COMPLAINED, WAS TOLD TO RETURN IT FOR REFUND.... THIS INFO SHOULD BE ON THE ITEM BEFORE PURCHASE.  ENDS UP WE STILL HAVE THE THING, A REAL DEAL",1300320000,,339,3.9411764705882355
8355290,5,B002806VOY,"I have a few of these Taunton DVD's and this one is by far the best.  Kelly Mehler does an excellent job of showing you how to set up your table saw to cut smoothly, accurately, and safely.  If you are a relative new comer to the Table Saw, this DVD is far better than reading a book (of which I have a few).",1296691200,3,308,3.796875
8355291,5,B002806VOY,"I really found this DVD useful as a newbie to table saws. I've never used one before and needed all the reference I could get. After reading the manual, a couple of table saw books and viewing some videos online, I still needed more to feel comfortable with the safety issues. This DVD answers a lot of the questions I still had. Just looking at the pictures in a book was no substitute for seeing someone use the correct procedures and explain them along the way. I'm still waiting on the book that compliments this DVD. Hopefully it will give full details on making some of the fence accessories he used in the video.
He also shows the assembly of the saw and explains maintenance along the way. There's lots of good info to be had here. Like how to do repetitive cuts, using a sled, safely cutting rabbets (and how NOT to). I'd definitely recommend this to first timers.",1294358400,2,873,4.4625
