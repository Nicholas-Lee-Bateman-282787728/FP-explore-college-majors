2434739,5,B000BPJJHE,Charles Bronson is often remembered only for his more violent films. In 'Act of Vengeance' he gives an amazing performance as a labor leader who stood up to corruption and paid the price for it. Bronson gives a moving performance as Jock Yablonski of the United Mine Workers union. This film was made for HBO and premiered in 1986. I was happy to find it for purchase. The film stands the test of time and is well worth watching even 27 years later.,1381104000,,449,4.421686746987952
2434740,4,B000BPJJHE,"sure, it may appear strange, but then again, this was filmed on location in the 70s.  its like a flashback to seeing the cars, businesses, and the way things were. movie was ok, considering what it is.",1377734400,,201,4.4324324324324325
2434741,2,B000BPJJHE,"It's based on the true story of Joseph Yablonski's assassination. He, his wife, and his daughter were killed by killers hired by a political opponent. You can find more about this by searching on the Web.

The scene of the mine explosion at the beginning is scary. That's the only good thing about this movie.

The video is faded. It seems it was transferred from VHS tape. Generally speaking, this movie is very close to truth. It's a drama. It's boring and forgettable. It's better to read the book about it.

I love Charles Bronson in movies such as Cold Sweat, Dead To Rights, Death Wish 1,Family of Cops 1, Family of Cops 3, Mr. Majestyk, Murphy's Law, Red Sun, The Evil That Men Do.",1371686400,,688,4.488
2434742,2,B000BPJJHE,Movie was good quality. It was nice seeing the girls kick ass on the bad guy. A spoiler for me was I recognized the voice of the bad guy so I immediately knew whodunit.,1357776000,,168,3.9705882352941178
2434743,2,B000BPJJHE,"What a disappointment this turned out to be.
I remember seeing this when it first came out,liked it then not now.
Could have had a better ending,i got mine through WB.
Movie was pretty much predictable in a lot of places.
Jack seriously had a major problem that's for sure.
He should have said to his victim's sing ""Jingle Balls"" not bells.
No trailer or extras of any kind,is a DvdR,silent-menu,90m.
There again if you like movies about psychotic people then i would recommend this.
Otherwise i'd stay clear.",1353715200,2,509,4.730337078651686
2434744,2,B000BPJJHE,"Yes I considder anything that has the picture cut off on the top and bottom to be edited.  I have a full screen (vhs) version recorded from cinemax years ago and this dvd simply puts black on the top and bottom for another useless ""fake widescreen"".  You will miss a few tit shots here and there.  Not too bad, but anything missing is bad.  Especialy since this is Jo Ann's big tour-du-force.  She is one of my very favorite under-rated actresses from that era.  I don't know why these studios don't realize that all it takes to have both versions on a disk, is a few measily lines of code.  Personaly, I would not bother anyway. Just keep it full screen. All modern 16 x 9 tv's will ""zoom"" a 3 x 4 picture to fit the screen giving you the exact same thing. ""IF THE WATCHER DISIRES TO DO SO"".
 Taking away the option to view an old ""late night cable revenge/exploitaion movie"" in the full screen way we saw them when we were young, ruins the nostalgia completely.
  I did NOT keep the disk.  Major disapoitment for a realy good movie that I've been waiting for a long time.",1325980800,9,1073,4.288557213930348
2434745,5,B000BPJJHE,"Jock Yablonski (Bronson) is a high-ranking official in the mineworker's union.  Jock decides to campaign against his boss, the corrupt union president Tony Boyle(Brimley), after Boyle makes a thoughtless, pro-company speech immediately following a tragic mine accident which kills 80 workers.  Jock's wife is played perfectly by Ellen Burstyn.  This is a true story of American greed and corrupt union leadership.  It's an old HBO film that still speaks to our times.  It was nice to see Bronson play a modest, non-violent family man so well.  Bronson and Burstyn are great as a smart, loyal and loving couple.  Wilfred Brimley excels as the villain of the piece.  Brimley is truly frightening as the icy, ruthless Boyle.  This is a gem that should not be forgotten.",1305676800,,766,5.064
2434746,4,B000BPJJHE,"Somebody blow the freakin' whistle!  Act of Vengeance (aka The Rape Squad) is a disturbingly creepy exploitation flick that for some reason got pounded into cinematic obscurity.  Shameful!  It's one of the earliest entries into the rape-revenge genre and desperately deserves to be recognized, like a registered sex offender.  So you distributers need to spead em and take one for the sleaze team, this is too good to pass up.

It's the savage tale about Linda, a beautiful young woman who gets raped by a man in a hockey mask (Jason you copycat killer!).  She joins a female group of rape victims as they all take steps to enact revenge on their perpetrator.

This movie starts off in extremely shocking fashion.  Linda gets slapped around and sexually violated by this stranger in disguise, and to add insult to injury he forces her to sing Jingle Bells during the horrific act.  Geez, talk about unnerving.  This really forces the viewer to feel her pain and hopelessness.  Afterwards when she goes to the police, their questioning is nearly as humiliating as the cops probably haven't taken a rape victim sensitivity class.

Acts of Violence is obviously a product of the 70's--it doesn't skimp out on the graphic violence or clothesless females.  The acting doesn't always hit the spot, but what's a grindhouse flick without some overacting and a few annoying high-pitched screeches?  Rhetorical dude.  Throw in a heavy dose of misogyny, a little bit of comedy, plus a silly predictable climax, and you've got yourself a despicable winner, winner, chicken dinner.",1298764800,16,1568,5.0
2434747,5,B000BPJJHE,"This is one of the best movies out there that depicts the struggles of the working man. Jock Yablonski was a great man, that did great things for the coal miner. For this, he was killed, along with his wife and daughter. Sad.",1279411200,,225,4.255813953488372

2434759,4,B000BPJJHE,The picture quality is great and the acting is actually surprisingly good (from MOST of the actors) for such a old and low budget movie.

2434765,3,B000BPJJHE,"ACT OF VENGEANCE (aka: RAPE SQUAD) opens w/ a woman named Linda being beaten and raped by a brutal, mask-wearing maniac. The perpetrator wears a goalie mask and a boiler suit (hmmm, sounds vaguely familiar). Linda's ordeal at police headquarters is humiliating and infuriating. Then, her idiot boyfriend proves just how little he understands or cares about the whole situation. Meanwhile, The rapist strikes again. He has an absurd habit of forcing his victims to sing Jingle Bells (!!) during the attacks. Eventually, Linda and four other victims are brought in to view possible suspects. While nothing comes of the line-up, Linda decides to take the opportunity to convince the others to form a rape squad. At first, it's just to get the word out and to advocate for victims. However, after running into opposition from the knuckle-dragging, slobbering male population, the squad turns to learning self defense techniques. Then, it's into the hot tub for a meeting. The problem w/ this movie is in its use of rape as a means of exploitation. The women are hot and perpetually vengeful, spending lots of time naked. Also, nearly every man in the film is a hyper-macho, Neanderthal jackass. The squad go out of their way to entice, entrap, and crush said cavemen. Then, it comes time for the women to bring the beat down, including great bodily injury and massive property damage. The squad also marks their targets w/ blue dye! The best part of the movie occurs when they unleash their karate on a local pimp. He's hilarious! Not very surprisingly, the goalie-mask guy returns. Now, he's on a mission of his own, and begins hunting down and killing his former victims. Can Linda and her cohorts survive long enough to introduce him to their brand of justice? AOV is an average 70s thriller meant for the drive-in crowd...",1395187200,8,1822,4.880645161290323
