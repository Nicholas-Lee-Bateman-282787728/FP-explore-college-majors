8601367,3,B00E5BIM3W,"This box set contains 6 operas on separate DVDs and a small booklet listing the casts of each of the operas plus a very short Verdi history. Four of the operas are available separately. The operas are:

ATTILA (2.4 stars)
This opera is available separately. The only Amazon customer review is here:

I concur with this review. This opera was performed outdoors with plenty of visual effects but was otherwise lacking.

LUISA MILLER (4.2 stars)

I agree that the performances were excellent. However, the scarcity of scenery and the non-period costumes detracted from the flow of the story.

IL TROVATORE (3.0 stars)
I can't find this opera issued by itself. It is well done but is not the best. Paolo Arrivabeni conducted the Orchestra of the Opera Royal de Wallonie. Fabio Armiliato sang Manrico and Daniela Dessi sang Leonora. Most of the conductor's body was higher than the stage, which was distracting in the long camera shots. That might be the reason this opera is not available on its own.

LA TRAVIATA (4.0 stars)
The Amazon customer reviews appear at two places:

The singing was solid. The scenery was a little over the top. For example, the end of the opera took place in a bed that was too short for its owner to sleep in. The lighting crew did an excellent job of keeping attention focused on the drama.

SIMON BOCCANEGRA (3.0 stars)
This opera is not sold separately. The singing was very good, including the ensemble work. Philippe Auguin conducted the Orchestra of the Teatro Massimo di Palermo. Roberto Frontali sang Simon Boccanegra and Amarilli Nizza sang Maria Boccanegra. The acting ranged from good to very good. The scenery choices were awful - a mix of period/abstract/generic. It pulled the audience out of the story, not into it.

FALSTAFF (3.0 stars)

This Falstaff had consistently good singing. The scenery was way too abstract, although it was obvious a great deal of planning went into it. It  did have some eye appeal. Costumes were so similar it was sometimes hard to tell the characters apart. Characters occasionally broke out with arm motions that were reminiscent of Peter Sellars' productions. The director created his own characters to silently urge the story along. The director seemed to emphasize the comedic side of the opera.",1469491200,2,3443,6.6547884187082404
