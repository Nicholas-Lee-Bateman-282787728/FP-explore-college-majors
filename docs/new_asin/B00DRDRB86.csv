5848520,3,B00DRDRB86,"Treasure Guards is an adventure movie. Similar to Allan Quartermain or The Librarian.

A Vatican Treasure Guard, and his sidekick brother, team up with a female archaeologist to find the lost Seal of Solomon, his ring and a big stash of diamonds. They jet all over the world, hunting down clues and artifacts, deciphering codes and dealing with bad guys.

Although not a super big budget movie, it certainly not a low budget B movie. The characters are likable, it's somewhat fast paced and the storyline flows well. The actors do a fine job.

Family friendly: For the most part. In the beginning, there is a brief shower scene that shows breasts and another scene with a man in just his underwear. Other than that, you are pretty safe. A few people get killed, but violence is not major.

I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. I had never heard of the movie nor the actors but I took a chance and I never once considered ending it early. In fact I may watch it again. I think the rental is for several days.

A movie/TV rating of 5 for me is outstanding. 4 is great. 3 is pretty good. So, a 3.",1382313600,12,1110,4.342995169082125

While on a dig archaeologist Victoria Carter discovers an ancient parchment that tells the location of the lost Seal Of Solomon with God gave to King Solomon. When word of this gets out more then just Victoria begin to search for it. The search becomes a battle between good and evil. I am a huge fan of movies like this. Indiana Jones, National Treasure and the Da Vinci Code movies are so much fun to watch over and over so I was looking forward to this. The beginning started off OK and made me interested. The longer the movie went on though it started to drag and lose me a little, the end was OK but really this wasn't as exciting and interesting as I was hoping for. I would compare this movie more to the Libraian series then the other big budget ones like this, but seeing as they are both TV movies you can't fault it for that. Overall, an OK movie on it's own as long as you don't compare it to the big budget ones. I give it a C+.",1375488000,8,1035,4.18

Teams in Rome and Oxford: An official South Africa/German Co-Production

This looks like the production (Treasure Guards) is designed to be a pilot for ether a T.V. series of a series of films similar to The Librarian 2004.

It has all the earmarks of a Hallmark movie with fake looking treasures and unrequited love. A tad of Indiana Jones tossed in.

------------------
Angelo (Raoul Bova) lost at love and decides to become a priest; naturally he is re-routed into becoming a Treasure Guard. He is force to join forces with, yes, a girl of all things (Anna Friel) on a quest. His philandering brother tags along.

What Trouble can they possibly get into?

There's nothing particularly ""great"" about the flick...  but it is a fun adventure movie...  not unlike an Indian Jones / Tomb Raider / Librarian kind of thing...  It's clearly lower budget, but still face paced, plenty of suspense, decent action, etc...

Acting, camera work, audio, etc...  all on point...  Not a ton of special effects, but the ones they used looked ok.  Same goes for fight choreography and stunt work...

Similar plots have been done a bunch of times...  regardless, this is still a fun little romp of a movie...",1522368000,3,576,4.7272727272727275
5848546,3,B00DRDRB86,"The premise that there's a Vatican Force seeking genuine artifacts isn't new, but is presented here in a bit of a different light. Kind of like the old TV show ""Warehouse 13,"" in which various exotic and powerful items were found and then stored. We don't get to see any of the other relics, which was a disappointment. They only say there's 54 of them, and this team is seeking the 55th.

Not to blow it for you, but the search is decent. Moves around well. However, it's easy to determine the true villian WAY too eary in the film. Not much subtlety in how they painted the false villian, which ends up being the entire motivation for the team...to save the bad guy who wasn't the bad guy after all.

Then, there's the last 15 minutes or so. They either ran out of money or inspiration, not sure which. But, the final push to actually GET the Ring of Solomon and discover the diamond mine was, to put it bluntly, VERY disappointing. Then, it's all wrapped up with no clarity at all and we barely even get a glimpse of the whole objective of the movie...the diamonds of Solomon!

It's not a BAD movie, but it's not a GOOD movie, either. It's what I call ""a strange little movie."" It had potential. The acting was well done, especially the flaky brother, Luca. But, they squandered the first 95% of the movie by shortchanging us, the audience, in the last 5%.

Movies that just END, with no definitive closure for the dangling plot lines REALLY tick me off! This movie does that. A ""3"" says you ""like it,"" well, it's really only a ""2.5."" I liked most of it, but at the end, it became apparent that I'd pretty much wasted an hour and a half of my precious time. They REALLY could have done a decent job, simply by adding maybe ten more minutes, some wrapping up of a few of the character lines and it would have been really nice if the male and female leads would have at LEAST kissed!

It would have been OK. He might work for the Vatican, but he's not really a priest.",1522368000,3,1969,4.3108108108108105

It may not be art for the ages, but it has action, adventure, intrigue, romance and a few laughs.  The cast is excellent and they all do a good job, making the story a bit better than perhaps the script deserves.

5848609,1,B00DRDRB86,The whole movie is OK at best but the ending really makes it a bad film! I was expecting jewels and diamonds everywhere in some kind of mountain scene. But NOPE literally a handful with no amazing reveal. Really stupid Don't watch not worth it.,1387929600,,244,4.444444444444445
5848610,5,B00DRDRB86,"The action was fun, the movie HAD a plot (always a Plus!!) and the actors were lots of fun. Def a good movie, and if you can handle ONLY ONE scene with a woman's breasts in the very beginning, then this movie fully deserved it's PG-13 rating. Had the typical ""treasure hunting"" action, but there's a bit of a romance brewing perhaps? Wondering if there'll be a second movie in this series?

Not sure if they consider this a feature but annoying you throughout an entire movie just makes you go watch it some place else.",1527811200,,305,4.666666666666667

8596635,4,B00DRDRB86,"Low Four Stars is the best I can give this movie.

This is not a terrible movie. It's not an excellent movie.
It's a cute move though.

This can be an entertaining movie. It has some good acting and it has moments where it has terrible acting. The plot is ok but it's easy to see who the bad guy is right from the beginning almost. There is a little bit of a romance but it's hard to 'feel the sparks flying' and at the end your not quiet sure why the fell in love since there is so minimal talking between the two.

It has the feel of a fun family flick but then right at the beginning, there is a scene of man making out with three women and right after that a topless woman. This means it's not a family movie that you can sit with Grandpa and the kids and watch it without being embarrassed. Sadly, this is all that stops it from being a fun movie to watch with the family. The violence is minimal, there is no blood, and no swear words.

At the end I had mixed emotions about this movie but overall it was an easy to watch show.",1527033600,,1033,3.975845410628019
8596636,5,B00DRDRB86,"Good mystery and history combined.  Fantastic scenery.  Anna Friel was excellent as always
in this film.  Good cast overall.  The film ends as if a sequel was planned.
But looking at IMDB and what Anna Friel did afterwards ( film was made in 2011 ),
it doesn't appear as if she appeared in any sequel.",1526774400,,301,4.418181818181818
