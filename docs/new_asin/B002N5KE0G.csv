3955307,4,B002N5KE0G,"Organist JIMMY SMITH brings the funky grooves, showing why he's become an icon for acidjazz, breakbeat, and neo-funk artists of today.

Modern disciples like Money Mark, Soulive, Galactic, and Medeski Martin And Wood have deservedly raised the profile of this underrated groove merchant. With so may cuts by Jimmy Smith, Grant Green, and Jack McDuff sampled in current hipster musics, this great disc comes at the perfect time for new fans to get it on the good foot.

Playing side-by-side with uncanny empathy his trio makes the stone cool start to boil. Jimmy is the full-on leader supplemented thoughtfully and tastefully by guitarist Eddie McFadden. (Fans of Walter Becker should take note.) Drummer Charlie Crsoby stealthily pulls it all together. One of the many thrills of this film is getting to see close-ups of Jimmy's patented hand and leg techniques in action, innovations he pioneered that have become the arsenal of every organist since. Whether revamping pop standards, bebop stallions, or busting out a gritty vocal on ""Got My Mojo Working"", Jimmy is on top here and you get to sit right beside him at the controls.

Kudos also to the terrifically insightful liner notes by Ashley Kahn, with a career overview, anecdotes, and lay descriptions of his amazing chops.",1261094400,7,1280,5.085714285714285

He realy is a icon,king of the hammond organ. Teaming up with guitarist Eddie McFadden

Leave it to Jazz Icons Productions & Naxos, and Paris, to give us our first great quality concert of Jimmy Smith. 90 Minutes of glorious black & white, with excellent sound, and a 24 page booklet. Circa 1969.

After being very dissapointed with THE CHAMP dvd, this one shines and grooves!

I was getting worried that there might be so little footage of Jimmy, we'd lost the chance at revisiting his genius on dvd. But, thanks to this concert, and his appearance on A NIGHT WITH BLUE NOTE dvd, we have him in all his home cookin' splendor!

Lets hope more great quality videos of Jimmy Smith will be forthcoming. But for now, this one will be just fine!",1256947200,12,883,4.269461077844311

8374586,4,B002N5KE0G,"Sometimes when someone is heralded as the King of Jazz Organ  (Hammond B 3) we appease them by agreeing without really knowing. I think this 90 minute color video serves as ample testimony in behalf of that claim. Backed by guitarist Eddie McFadden & drummer Charlie Crosby this set swings: ""Sonnymoon for Two"" an upbeat tribute to Sonny Rollins, Days of wine & Roses (Move Over Mr. Mancini), 23 minutes of Smith's signature song ""The Sermon"", Alfie, Ellington's ""Satin Doll (twice), ""Organ GrinderSwing"", ""Got My Mojo Working"", "" See See Rider"", (had he performed this on the west coast we can assume this would have been sea sea rider or sea surf rider), ""A Funky Blues Called I Don't Know"" (?), ""My Romance"". His best known Blue Note albums proclaimed him ""The Incredible Jimmy Smith"" and from the mid-50s to his death in 2005 he was The Incredible, King of Jazz Organ showcasing tunes about church, love and food. Amen.",1391040000,,923,4.76875
8374587,5,B002N5KE0G,"I am a musician, primarily blues but appreciate that there are only two kinds of music, good music and good music played badly. This is a blast from the past.

8374588,4,B002N5KE0G,"~ This 85 minute, black and white video is interesting to me because I was fortunate enough to see the Jimmy Smith Trio at the Colonial Club in Toronto at approximately the same time as this video was recorded in France, although in Toronto the drummer was Candy Finch.
~ For this December 1969 concert, Jimmy is supported by drummer Charlie Crosby and long-time guitarist Eddie McFadden.  Charlie Crosby performs nicely without being flashy or intrusive on the organ and guitar solos.  For those familiar with the Jimmy Smith recordings for Blue Note on which Eddie McFadden serves mostly in an accompanying role with infrequent brief solos, you will be pleasantly surprised by the amount of solo space the guitarist is given here.  Here Eddie stretches out with solos on every tune and on several tunes it is Eddie rather than Jimmy who introduces the theme.  Eddie will never go down in history as a great soloist, but he fares well in this video and greatly enhances his reputation.  Of course, Jimmy's playing is superb.  In 1969 Jimmy was at the top of his game and at the height of his popularity.
~ When playing live, Jimmy had the habit of introducing songs with long improvisations in which he quoted classical music and messed around with the harmony and rhythm of what was about to come in the tune.  Of course, the other members of the trio had no idea of where he was going or when they were supposed to join in at the start of the tune.  To deal with that, the stage set-up is such that the three musicians are closely packed together so they could have immediate and intimate communication.
~ The trio performs 11 tunes ranging from standards (""See See Rider"" and ""Satin Doll"" - two versions) to Jimmy Smith originals (""A Funky Blues Called 'I Don't Know' "") and several of Jimmy's classics including ""The Sermon"", ""Organ Grinder Swing"", and ""Got My Mojo Working"" with Jimmy's gravel-voiced vocals.  The program ranges from beautiful ballades (""Days of Wine & Roses"", ""Alfie"", ""My Romance"") to funky up-tempo romps.
~ The monaural sound is not studio quality, but is good for a live recording.
~ The camera work is very good; artistic to a certain extent but also valuable for students of the organ and guitar.  Every time Jimmy or Eddie solo, the camera moves in and captures everything they are doing.  From that point of view, the video is a valuable learning tool for organists and guitarists.  Unfortunately, the cameramen did not attempt to capture Jimmy's outstanding bass playing with his feet.  Every time I saw Jimmy in concert I was always amazed at the footwork.
~ The 24-page insert booklet is extremely informative.  Ashley Kahn not only puts the concert in historical perspective, but he provides detailed musical analysis of the music and solos.  A valuable addition to the DVD package.
~ Not sure if it is just my copy of the DVD, but there are a few (very few) ""flickers"" in the video image as the on-screen credits start to role; however, the sound is never effected by these flickers.
~ Overall, this video is recommended for fans of Jimmy Smith.",1329436800,4,3082,4.713221601489758
8374589,5,B002N5KE0G,"I have lots of Jimmy Smith's recordings , but to see this DVD was special because Jimmy Smith was and always be the very best on the the Hammond B-3 organ. He swings so hard in the groove you have to move and be amazed at his technical prowess and how he makes the blues so soulful and delicious!  What he does with the music is so easy to listen to.  Everyone whoever heard of Jimmy Smith should make this recording a part of their collection! He's the best - period!  Go ahead on Jimmy!",1323216000,2,488,4.11578947368421
8374590,4,B002N5KE0G,"I can't say enough to express what the sound of Jimmy Smith means to me. I was born and grew up in Harlem USA. one block from Minton's Playhouse. At the age of 15 I ran errands for the musicans and hid in the back of the club in order to watch a show. The likes of Blue Mitchel. Lou Donaldson, Stanley Turrentine, Monk, Carmen Mcrae and the list goes on. But never was I so blown away until I saw Jimmy Smith. I could not believe MY EYES. He was like an octopus. The hands and feet were totaly independent of each other and his head moved like Jerry Springers girls  'Show me the hands""  Jimmy was truly INCREDIBLE. My favorite tune was 'There's A Small Hotel'
Don't ask me why? maybe it was because I was ready to DO THE THING. lol.
No, on the real side, Jimmy was, as Grover later stated when referring to Mr. RAY BRYANT: ""PAR-EXECELLANCE"" The only disapointment I had was, when I became an adult and no longer had to hide in the back of the clubs..Smalls, The Baron, Basie's.. Baby Grand, Franks.. Club LaChos (phonetic) at 155st and McCombs place. Now, that was one of the most intimate small clubs in Harlem. Great sound system and beautiful women, I was too young. lol.  I'd Paint a Mustache at Birdland to hide
 from Pee Wee. Jimmy seldom appeared in NYC. I searched for days to find a DVD live performance of him. Thanks to 'JAZZ ICONS' distributed by AMAZON.COM at the ripe age of 71 I can enjoy my favorite instrument played by the greatest organist of all times JIMMY SMITH... Richard Grove Homes, Jack McDuff and Joey DeFRANCESCO's  CD 'LIVE at the SPOT' Brings back memories of the Live jazz scens I grew up attending. CHECK OUT HOUSE PARTY BY JIMMY. For me,there is nothing that can compare with the slick TEMPO WHILE 'Trading Fours.' So If your young and never had a chance to see JIMMY SMITH: You have to purchase JAZZ ICON's Jimmy Smith @ The Organ. Live DVD.
ENJOY
