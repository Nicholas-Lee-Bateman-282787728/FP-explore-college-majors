3948333,5,B002LITRJ4,"Betty and Don Go To Rome to Visit Connie Hilton is the thrust of this episode.  The attention to detail right down to Italian interior decor, hair styles and fashion of the 1960s is nothing short of astonishing.  Fellini himself couldn't have accessorized his own sets any better!  While in Rome, Betty gets made over in the Italian style for an evening and she is barely recognizable.",1254700800,2,385,4.7164179104477615
3948334,5,B002LITRJ4,"The two lasting images in this episode are Betty with her new-old Victorian fainting couch with dress to match and Don in a late night reenactment of the noir film NIAGARA, seedy motel and all. Everyone else is good too but maybe it is because everyone back in that time period wanted to BE Betty or Don, that they captivate us so. Everyone continues to jockey for position at Sterling Cooper.  Seemingly the order of the day is to just outflank your colleagues at Sterling Cooper.  Cooper himself outflanks Draper so that Draper can't leave him high and dry while Peggy tries to do just that--moving out and on, probably with Duck who has all female product clients with another agency. Joan is gone but I really don't believe it. As for Roger Sterling........... uhm..... Roger who?",1254096000,,784,4.7153284671532845
3948335,5,B002LITRJ4,"This episode reminds me of Woody Allen's MATCH POINT.  The whole thing turns on a simple twist of fate or luck. The Brits who now own the agency come over for a meet and greet.  There are three of them and they have plotted out exactly how the agency will further change.  The two older Brits have a bright young man with his Oxford degrees and such along with them and it is clear this is their fair haired young knight in shining armor.  He is going to be their new star player on the meeting the clients side.  This isn't great news for Don but he's still creative so he's less affected than others, who are just being mowed over by the Brits, especially Sterling who is left without any purpose or title.  But then there's that twist of fate or luck which takes place and everything is upended again.  Great episode.  I loved it.",1254009600,,833,4.294871794871795
3948336,5,B002LITRJ4,"I began watching Mad Men online and here I am in the third season and loving it every bit as much as ever.  This is the fourth episode of the third season and we are knee deep in the Draper family and the Cooper Sterling ad agency once again. An especially touching part of this episode is the little Draper girl spending time with her grandfather in his waning days. Another aspect of parents and their children is brought home at the ad agency when the son of a corporate titan decides to invest his future and fortune in the game of jai alai, predicting it will make baseball become passe in the USA.  We all know how he is going to fare but he barges ahead anyway.  The tv keeps us roughly abreast of where we are in time and I can tell we are in countdown mode to the Kennedy assassination.  I am on the edge of my seat imagining the impact it will have on these characters.  I am staying tuned and you should start!",1252281600,3,921,4.151685393258427

3948346,4,B002LITRJ4,"Mad Men continues to deliver in it's third season with many unexpected twists and turns.  Some negative reviewers complain about the slow pacing but perhaps they're not appreciating the deliberate evolution of the characters and the plot.  Spoilers ahead; Betty discovers Don's secret past, a British firm buys out Sterling/Cooper and then after their Brit efficiency expert raises the value of the firm it's sold leaving everyone's future in question.  Don has an affair with one of his kids teachers, Betty takes up with a political fixer for Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and decides to divorce Don despite recently having a baby boy with him.  Peggy has a relationship with Duck Phillips , and we get to meet famous hotelier Conrad Hilton who gives Don his account for the agency but turns out to be a high maintenance client.  Ultimately Don, Bert Cooper, Roger, Lane Pryce, decide to start their own agency through clever maneuvering bringing along Pete Campbell, Peggy, Harry Crane, and Joan operating out of a hotel suite.  Once again Matt Weiner provides a rich script chock full of engrossing story lines that are artfully blended together along with his eye for detail capturing the era to perfection.  There are reasons that ""Mad Men"" garnered all the awards and acclaim that it has and Season 3 provides ample proof.",1484697600,,1323,4.986363636363636

3948429,5,B002LITRJ4,"Mad men seasons 1 and 2 were thrilling but season 3 takes the prize home. If you have not seen the previous two seasons, it will still be enjoyable and you will immediately relate to all the cast members. The same cast from the previous season returns to entertain us. This is the kind of show that never disappoints. In season 2, we are left thinking that Don Draper had transformed from his meandering ways but to our surprise, he is still the ol' bad boy.

It has been said ad nauseum that Mad Men is a show that ""requires careful watching"". I will agree. It's sensitively done and nuanced. You have to actually watch the characters faces, tone of voice, interpersonal interactions and more. Not that it's a chore to do so! This exquisite level of intractate character development is what makes the show so very fascinating.

Here are some specific Season 3 Alerts.

This was the DVD, I would go with the BluRay if you can afford to.

SPOILER ALERTS

Betty his wife finds out that she is pregnant and they both decide to give their marriage one last shot. Apparently, women in the 60s had more chores and rights. There was no way she was going to leave even though she was aware of her husband's ways. Draper's marriage isn't the only thing that is in the verge of breaking. The advertising agency where Draper works merges with a British company leaving Pete, Don's colleague, fighting for his job with Ken. Meanwhile, Joan quits her job to be a house wife with the hope that her husband who is a doctor will get a promotion.

She is later seen begging for her job back after the promotion plan fails. The commentaries that are in the episodes are funny and some are out rightly lame. Brace yourself for a roller coaster of emotions. There are episodes that will leave you sympathizing with one character and have you hate the same character in the next episode. The character growth of each cast member is the glue factor in mad men. For instance, in season 1, Pete's marriage with Trudy was in the verge of a breakup but in this season, the marriage seems to be improving. There was also great expectation that Don's 3 kids would start to get along in this chapter but it didn't happen.

Sally Draper, the eldest of the 3 children acted so beautifully this season and it seems like she is destined for greatness and she is the young actress to watch out for.

The last episodes of the season are full of action and suspense- a strategy meant to induce anticipation for season 4. You wouldn't want to get spoilers in a review and making time during the weekend to watch this season is the cleverest thing to do. You will not regret watching this certified suspense filled rib cracker.",1422489600,25,2689,4.507186858316222

3948434,4,B002LITRJ4,"It does not start up where the last season left off, you find yourself surmising that this 4 yr old boy was the tiny baby, that Peggy having had the baby, and it is now being raised by her sister, and Don seems to have turned over a bit of a new leaf.  More, but  you know what I mean, you kinda have to figure out what is going on as it starts.

It's Four Discs, it was sealed in the package, But the first disc kinda jumped around on the screen, as if it was a defective item from the manufacturer, or scratched, one of the discs was also loose from the little snap on catch that holds them in the case;  perhaps that is where I missed the beginning as it should have been.  I haven't played the other discs yet.

All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.  I would not blame Amazon if the story line was not to my liking, this review is only about the quality of the disc.

Usually, when I purchase a DVD, I know whether or not I'm going to enjoy the story line.

I was a teen in the generation the story is in, I find it is MOSTLY accurate, with a few timeline or set discrepancy's that you wouldn't notice unless you were aware of what was going on during that era.
Very Mid Century Modern furnishings, right down to the glassware (you see a lot of that since all they do is drink) .

The blu-rays have fantastic extras -- featurettes on various subjects (different for each season) and commentary for EVERY SHOW by a pair of actors most involved in that episode.

3948487,4,B002LITRJ4,"Season 3 is largely a filler, which is not uncommon in a multi-season series. There is a little more character development - we see a personal side to Joan outside the office and Peggy is not the wallflower any more. The childlike Roger, who inherited his partnership is demonstrating his inadequacy in this season. Betty discovers Don's secret and divorces him, with a new husband waiting in the wings. Sally, Don and Betty's daughter, played by a fiesty Kiernan Shipka  shows herself to be fine actress in her expanded role.

After a buy out from a London firm, Sterling Cooper is trimmed of the fat - an opportunity to release some characters to make way for new ones. The twist at the end (no spoilers) leaves you on a cliffhanger for Season 4. Without waiting, I had to start on Season 4 immediately.

As always, there is the story which could pass as a soap opera. But there is so much going on under the surface, turning it not only into a glimpse of the moral and social mores of the times, but exploring the many facets of each character. Don Draper - serial philanderer, chain smoker, alcoholic - should be an unsympathetic character, but we are privvy to who he really is and how he got there, and we can't help caring about him.  And thus they become our colleagues and friends. I do miss Salvatore Romano, played by Bryan Batt, who was canned.

Again there may have been historically inaccuracies, but there are many throwaway scenes that add depth, like Don filling up his gas cigarette lighter at his desk.

Am already halfway through Season 4 and loving it.",1392681600,,1573,4.580071174377224

I love the way they describe how things were so un-politically correct in the workplace, which helps to remind us how far we have come today. I never heard of Jon Hamm until I began watching this series, but he clearly is an excellent actor who brings his character to life. The rest of the cast are equally enjoyable, and talented! I love the scene where he and his wife, Betty, are on a picnic with their children. When ready to leave, he throws his beer can into the park, and his wife shakes off the trash from their picnic blanket onto the lawn, and then they leave, not thinking one bit about the trash they left behind. I laughed at this because I remember as a kid listening to TV commercials on the importance of cleaning up after ourselves, this after it become recognized how people did not care what they did.

The show is very entertaining with their one-liners that leave you laughing in stitches. I would not want us to go back to this type of work environment, but it is entertaining to watch how things were. You will not be disappointed in this series.",1384819200,,1123,4.347619047619047

3948572,5,B002LITRJ4,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad-man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones as Don's ex-wife), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 3. There are two more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1353715200,,2492,4.680365296803653

I purchased season one a month ago to catch up and have rapidly gone through each season more and more intrigued and amazed at ""what could happen next?!""

Start from season one, episode one and enjoy a quality series.",1351641600,,403,4.690140845070423
3948576,3,B002LITRJ4,"As the series moves along, creator and lead writer Weiner wants to get inside his characters' heads more. The peculiar thing is that the characters don't develop all that much. Don is still the philanderer, Betty is still the spoiled brat, Roger still drinks copious amounts of booze while delivering the funniest short one-liners, Joanie is ever the pragmatist, and so on. So subsequent seasons are ""more of the same"".

If you like spending time with these characters, as I do, you'll like season three and beyond. If you're expecting character transformation, look elsewhere. Perhaps this tyle comes from Weiner's time on ""The Sopranos""--Tony was the same guy at the end as at the start, as were many of his cronies and under-age-60 family members. So it is with Mad Men. The lack of development may frustrate some people, while others will be very much relieved that the show does not try to jump the shark.",1350086400,,910,4.833333333333333

I was disappointed because it was NOT the Mad Men box sets I know and love (so much). So, I returned it. But I went to Fry's Electronics earlier today and they only had the same version. So I guess I'm on the hunt for the box set! If you are fine with Season Three being skinnier than the other seasons' box sets then you should be fine, but I was not happy with this. Also, you save about eight dollars off the retail price with this seller! (Fry's sells it for $22 and this Amazon seller has it for $16).",1346630400,,821,4.235668789808917
3948580,5,B002LITRJ4,"I like how the writers capture that eerie feeling that surrounded the actual day and the days after the Kennedy assassination when people were in suspended animation... should we go to a wedding, should we go for a drive, or should we just stay glued to the TV? Kind of like what happened after 9/11. Betty's reaction after witnessing the shooting of Oswald on live TV was so true to life; people really wondered those few days if the US was tipping over into madness. The reaction of the men ""Take a pill and lie down"" or ""Presidents have been killed throughout our history and we've survived"" was also rather telling. JFK definitely appealed more to the ladies than to men. An excellent, excellent episode.",1346544000,,708,4.672
3948581,5,B002LITRJ4,"The rather pathetic story line about gay Sal aside, the most startling thing about this episode is the realization that maybe Don is really losing his touch and may not be up to the tougher advertising challenges expected of him in the big leagues. His client Conrad Hilton has a true vision for his company and for its role in the world, and Don presents him with a mundane campaign centered around clean towels and ice water. (I doubt Peggy had anything to do with this unfortunate campaign!). No wonder Connie storms out after shaming Don to his face. The stunned look on Don's face says it all.

Much is made about Betty and how spoiled and selfish she is in particular, but the bored housewife type that she personifies was a pretty recent post World War II phenomenon. When most Americans lived on farms, women didn't have time to be bored, and women living in the city had constant interactions with butchers, bakers, and the like. After the war when everyone fled to the leafy suburbs, women were stuck at home with their kids, with nothing to do but play bridge and have affairs. Their descendants are the stupid housewives of Beverly Hills, New Jersey, and Orange County.

As always a great multi-layered episode with marvelous acting and period touches.",1346457600,,1264,4.714932126696833

The references to NY state politics of 1962 are fascinating. In this era of the no-nothing Tea Party idiots, it's almost impossible to believe that the leader of the GOP at that time was Nelson A. Rockefeller, the quintessential liberal Republican who believed in civil rights, Medicare, abortion rights and the power of government to right societal wrongs. How times have changed!

The prison guard father informed his wife might die by a nurse but not allowed to see her? I know the present practice of inviting the whole clan in to see the birth and videotape it has maybe taken it too far, but those days seem pretty brutal! Don and Betty seem on a temporary respite before tensions arise again.",1345593600,,511,4.565217391304348
3948585,3,B002LITRJ4,"Though melodramatic the Season 2 finale of Mad Men had one of the most concrete and enriching ends. It showed us a side of Peggy we didn't know exists. Mad Men definitely slows down in Season 3 and eventually there are a lot of things that take a completely different turn. For me the star of this season was the character, Pete Campbell. I think he's one of the most interesting actors on the show and he is terrific, he's the sort of slow burner character that grows on all of us and he is funny even when he isn't and is simply being himself. I feel this is where Mad Men shines, it shows such a vast array of characters who actually seem to live in their own theater.

Don Draper, the central character, takes quite a few hits in this season and amazingly enough it is like a see saw between him and his wife, Betty. Betty truly finds herself in this season and after many years of marriage decides to venture out. It is amusingly sad to see their relationship disrupt because of the conviction with which Draper carries himself is complete undwindling. Don Draper is right even when he is wrong, his eyes seem to show a complete contrast to the morality of his actions. Would this sort of a person be accepted by other as a friend? Notice he doesn't have any friends except maybe good old Peggy.

In Season 3, the women of the show find themselves while the men stands on confused grounds.

One of my favourite episodes of the show was the one where the President has just been assasinated. The response of people all over the country is one of emergency, alarm and everybody in general is devastated. The show very keenly highlights how there was an absence of the vicarious disease which seems to have taken over America. What I'm trying to say is that the way people are saddened by the President's assasination is the true indicator of compassion which country men in those days felt. Forgive me and correct if I'm wrong but a similar incident in today's time would raise different reactions from the general lack of attention span...ok I'll stop dwelling on that. It was such an awesome episode.

While I liked Season 3, there is something amiss here. Maybe I liked the show but I don't agree with the direction it went. Maybe I didn't like the falling apart. So let's see what the dvds of season 4 bring out for me.

Sterling is another one of my favorite characters and I hope they keep him around. I'll soon find out.",1343520000,,2430,4.439461883408072

3948589,5,B002LITRJ4,"The plot line of the third season that was the most interesting for me was Don's relationship with hotel magnate Conrad Hilton.  Don meets Hilton at the Derby Day party, but at first knows nothing more about him than that's he's a guy looking for a drink.  Hey, Don can certainly identify with that, and hops behind the vacant bar and whips up an Old Fashioned or whatever for him in no time.  Over the drinks Don and his new acquaintance recognize one another as country boys who had to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.  ""Call me Conny,"" says Hilton, in way of an introduction, and expresses a desire to have Don do some advertizing work for his hotel chain--as Conny would like nothing better than to work with a fellow self-made country boy.

In the ensuing episodes Don does his best to develop an advertizing campaign for Hilton.  His resulting pitches are essentially the iconic magazine spreads that I saw in the 1960's, with Hilton hotels as the perennial source of American amenities for international U.S. business travelers.

3948591,5,B002LITRJ4,"I've purchased seasons one through four so far, and we are eagerly anticipating the beginning of season five! Season three was as good as season one and season two, and kept the pace of the preceding seasons.

I was disappointed in the Drapers in that they appear to still be very much in love with each other, but don't seem to be able to make their relationship work. Don is a lost soul, and Betty looks to be trying to replace Don with someone who can keep his manhood in his pants, as well as someone who she can be proud of socially. The older politician appears to fill the bill, and she is a trophy for him.

Betty continues to be rather cold, perhaps because of the facade she's had to maintain for the many years of her husband's philandering. Sally seems to be traumatized by the idea of a new baby, and her parents' strange and strained relationship.

Joan marries a young doctor to be, who appears to be a bit incompetent.

I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order.  It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds.  No episode guide, just the season 3 slipcover.

Wow, some of those cars were beautiful. Of course, the lead character, Don Draper, the great actor, Jon Hamm, seals the deal.

3948617,5,B002LITRJ4,"I've loved Mad Men from the first few minutes of the first episode in season one.  (I have the DVD series, which makes it very nice to watch, sans commercials.)  As I was around in the sixties (though I don't remember much from the early sixties), it's interesting to re-visit that strange and foreign place.

As always, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) drives the show.  Draper is the tough taskmaster who runs the creative end of Sterling Cooper advertising agency.  He's flawed as heck; he can't seem to turn down a pretty woman.  This season, a teacher is the object of his desire (or is it simple lust?).

Betty Draper goes through the most changes.  She meets an interesting man who is smitten by her (for how long) and this forces changes in the Draper household.  The children suffer a huge loss early in the season, and then an even greater loss in the last episodes.  And Don faces challenges at work as well as at home.  The stress of those changes would overwhelm most men, but not Draper.  He seems to be rather disengaged from certain things in his life; he may be motivated most by what feels right to him at the moment.

The DVD extras are very good.  The audio commentaries by the director, writers, and producer (it varies as to episodes) add a lot to the understanding of the series.  The writers, especially, weave in scenes from their own lives into Mad Men, so they have the ring of authenticity, with is very welcome.

Overall, another home run for Mad Men.  I've ordered season four, and can't wait to see what's in store for suburbia, the neighborhood, Don, Betty, and the kids (not to mention the women Draper finds himself attached to).

I could care less what happens to don draper or who he's going to sleep with next. Some people have expressed discontent with mad men because most of the characters are so unlikable. In response many have stated that that's part of what makes the show so great and gives it character (e.g. as a viewer finding oneself relating to such dislikable and offensive characters). In regards to the latter i think thats true to a small extent but overall i think the show walks a very fine line between portraying characters with faults/imperfections and making such behaviour seem acceptable and reinforcing sexism (more often than not the show seems to cross into the latter). I never really thought this show was all that great in the first place. If you are at all interested in watching a show that has well developed women, people of color, and glbt characters this is not it.

The drama in my opinion seems so realistic and believable, I love the way that they tie history into the show, (i.e. Monroe's suicide, JFK presidency/assassination, cold war...)

My wife and I have really liked this series. We got hooked after the first season one disk and have made our way now to the end of season three. Overall, we find the series to be very good, and we look forward to seeing it continue for many more seasons.

That being said, we did not like this season quite as much as the two before. It seemed to us that the series was kind of all over the place and a little out of focus compared to what it had been before. The situation did improve later in the third season, and the last episode was really good. We are looking forward to seasons 4 and 5.

Spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At the end of season 3, Don and Betty are finished as a couple.

3948645,5,B002LITRJ4,"First of all- great series, great show, great season!  I am a fan.

Towards the end of season 3, the last two episodes I believe, quite a lot of attention was placed on television footage from 1963, and the JF Kennedy assassination.  For those of us who remember that time, the show brilliantly brought back MY cellular memory, anyway, and the tone of the country. They did a stellar job of recreating how that was for people.  Television had quickly become the hyponotherapy tool of the social era , as evidenced by the showing of the Draper kids constantly parked in front of the tube.  When I viewed, again after decades: the calculated way in which the news came through to the public;  the footage of Oswald being ""marched"" through a room by federal marshals, and then the ""convenient"" way the TV caught Jack Ruby shooting him, it was clear as a bell to me the entire thing was planned (and not by Oswald!)  from soup to nuts.... the assassination, as well as the ""media handling"" (read: psychological manipulation)  - largely of the shocked grieving public. Lone gunman indeed!  Successful manipulation and diverted attention of the public has succeeded ever since.  Brought a great chill to me, through and through.",1293235200,,1222,4.776190476190476

3948649,5,B002LITRJ4,"AMC's breakout smash ""Mad Men"" continues its winning ways in Season 3, even as all of its characters seem to be teetering on the brink of losing everything.  Never maudlin, always surprising, ""Mad Men"" keeps its cast on its toes as characters both major and minor come up against some of the harshest shocks any person should have to face.

Jon Hamm once again reincarnates Cary Grant in his portrayal of Madison Avenue's shining light, Don Draper.  This guy is one maddening dude, puzzling both the other characters as well as the audience.  Many would ask why he is so carefree with his marriage to the seemingly perfect Betsy (January Jones), although the show does a great job showing why Don finds the facade of domestic bliss to be so unsatisfying without making Betsy into a total harridan.  But every time Draper leans too far to the side of the unsympathetic womanizer, he does something that is as true and honorable as anything that can be found on the show.  Betsy, for all her faults, also comes across as human, if flawed, in Season 3.

The British Invasion of Sterling Cooper does not go swimmingly in Season 3, and the cultural clashes are almost as powerful as the blades of a John Deere tractor (which make an unfortunate appearance in the S-C headquarters - this is why my firm has banned riding lawnmowers in the office).  Draper and the crew try to keep things going despite the Brits' penny-pinching, dictatorial ways, but you can tell that Sterling-Cooper's days are numbered, at least in its current incarnation.  Even Roger, the walking bon mot, begins to show the signs of strain despite professing to have found happiness with his second marriage.

Everywhere you look, characters are confronting internal crises.  These problems mirror the growing strains on the America of the early 1960s, as the writers powerfully use the assassinations of Medger Evers and JFK to add fuel to what is already a combustible mix.

All in all, if you have a favorite character on this show you are going to be pleased because virtually every character gets a chance to shine.  True, some parts are smaller than others, and the Don-and-Betsy show looms large over everything else, but this is a well-balanced show with a bevy of well-rounded, entertaining characters.  When the season finale rolls arounds, you will be at first upset that such a good season had to end, but you'll be thankful that there is a Season 4 to look forward to.",1291161600,3,2447,4.767772511848341
3948650,5,B002LITRJ4,"Mad Men is by far the best dramatic series I've ever seen.  It has blown away all of my expectations and hopes, and indeed what I thought is artistically possible in this day and age. I use the word genius sparingly, but it certainly applies to the creators of this series.

The historical setting (Madison Avenue circa 1960) is great for showing us how times have changed during the past two generations, every character is developed and portrayed in a way that I can believe and empathize with, and countless facets of the human condition are explored with remarkable depth and nuance, so I'll assert that this series deserves to be classed with the world's great stage productions and literature (dare we mention the name of Shakespeare?).

3948654,5,B002LITRJ4,"Enter here and abandon all hope:

Having stumbled upon this program in the first season, it made an instant impact on me, yet I find it hard to watch at times due to the dark nature of its underlying theme. Only nostalgia and an interest in cultural history makes it bearable viewing for me.

Scenario: the cusp of the 1960s: ""Madmen"" chronologically traces what many believe to be the greatest era of promise for the American way: the era of the Kennedy Camelot and the best of everything in one nation. America: the light on the hill; the envy of the world, boasting full employment, rising salaries, increasing leisure time, social security, honest corporations and rich people who paid their taxes, the promise of genuine egalitarianism and technical advancements destined to take us to the stars by the year 2000. It is within this environment that we are introduced to a successful advertising company, replete with poised, glamorous people who seem to encapsulate the essence of the great American idyll itself; faces from ""Vanity Fair"" or a Norman Rockwell contemporary...but...look closer, something is wrong.

The principal is Don Draper (who bears a striking resemblence to '60s pop-crooner, Jack Jones), the all-American war hero: the archetypal good-looking, successful businessman; romeo by evening and family man extraordinaire as it suits; the ultimate renaissance man; cool and smooth; without a care in the world... surely this is a facade, though? The real man is not that bright; almost certainly a coward in war and most probably an incompetent manager, both at work and at home; destructive to all those around him. Perhaps this is why Draper is invariably depicted in a black suit: the personification of death. His adopting the persona of a dead man re-inforces the motif of death.

Draper's beautiful wife, Betty, could have stepped out of a portrait of ""Stepford Brides"" ...except that this Grace Kelly lookalike is flaky, to say the least. The question is, did Don push her over the edge, or did she inherit her madness from her senile father?

Welcome to Sterling Cooper, where the men and women play loose and dirty for gain. Chief paramour, Joan Holloway, covers up for the infidelities of the men and does a very good job of it. Even the naive young office girl, Peggy Olsen, is a single-mindedly ambitious young woman, willing to sleep with whomever and do whatever it takes to climb the ladder out of the secretarial pool. She has some talent, yes, but eschews scruples when an opportunity for advancement presents itself. Don Draper doesn't care when Sterling Cooper sells out to the interlopers; he gets his half million and gets to start his own company - and he gets to keep wunderkind, Peggy. Peggy's madness seems to be her propensity to ruin relationships.

As within so outside of the office we see depictions of dysfunctional families and relationships, or plans that go awry: a tabloid world of childishness and absurdity. The entire scenario is certainly negative, but is it accurate? Life can't be all bad. True, but one must see this in the context of the developing ""Madmen"" theme: I don't think the writers' intention was to balance the good with the bad. Rather, I believe the exaggerated negativity is deliberate; symbolic of something.

I won't go through every character one-by-one because it really would be redundant. Suffice to say, nearly all of them are flawed in some manner. At Sterling Cooper, almost everyone drinks, smokes and lusts without restraint. It's a cesspool of junk people with nothing more than well-dressed, fashionable front to disguise their corruption; shallow people motivated only by their carnal desires. It's no surprise they cheer for Nixon over JFK on election night in the hope of lower taxes: typical greedy conservative monsters who put their own interests ahead of their fellow man.

One of the more complex characters is Anna Draper, the wife of the man whose identity Don stole. She is totally accepting of Don and his ""deadly sinning"" and even harbours an inexplicable confidence that he can change. Anna seems to represent the light that juxtaposes Don's darkness; a light that is destined to be extinguished, along with the American dream itself.

The assassination of JFK is the pivotal moment when the new dream is revealed as a nightmare in waiting - this killing, a deranged act of national suicide - or had the fatal shot already been fired five years earlier in Brooklyn?

""Madmen"" is an epic of failure: its characters take their partners and step out as the symbolic ""dancers of death""; dancing down to war instead of upward to the stars.",1287014400,11,4638,4.96520618556701

3948670,4,B002LITRJ4,"I have been watching the dvds of the first 3 seasons of Mad Men for several months and have come to the conclusion that I have no idea where the producer, Matthew Weiner, and his writing team are headed.  This is part of the reason that I am so addicted to the series, I never know what will happen next.  It's a good thing to keep the audience on its toes in this way because the writing and plot lines are often preposterous to the point of dada-istic. I don't think Weiner is that clever and that the improbability of the circumstances these characters operate within are actually the result of some faulty original thinking when the show was conceived.  Much of what goes down here for believable plot points would not get a passing grade at the American Film Institute screen-writers course.

The most glaring howler, to my mind, is the situation with the hero, Don Draper, played like a replicant Ken doll by Jon Hamm, a man of extraordinary handsomeness, in a bland kind of way, who can't act for beans (yet the awards continue to shower down upon him).  Don Draper is actually one Dick Whitman who stole the identity of the real Donald Draper when the latter was killed in the Korean war.  Dick survived, switched dog tags and went home as Don Draper.  Whoever he is Draper/Whitman is a cad, a jerk and a phony, and, with Hamm's  annoying, gravelly voice and pseudo-seductive delivery, the lowest order of lounge lizard.

So this basic flawed premise of the series has to be swallowed whole and then forgotten or the show is a non-starter.  The other great gaff is poor old Peggy Olson, getting pregnant on her first day at work at Sterling Cooper on Madison Avenue, gradually getting porkier and porkier as Season One unfolds and ending up going to the ER with a stomachache and, shazaam, giving birth to a 9 lb. baby boy.  We are to believe that an intelligent working woman in Manhattan in 1961 had absolutely no idea that she was pregnant until the blessed event occurs.

Matthew Weiner and his team must think all goyim, especially Catholic goyim (like Peggy), are so stupid and nave that this sort of thing could possibly happen.  Maybe in some Dogpatch somewhere but even that is pushing the limits of credulity.
Otherwise I must conclude that Weiner is delusional about his greatness and can't objectively assess and reject his bad ideas?

Whatever the case Mad Men is addictive because of the characters, the sets, the props, the costumes and make-up and the splendid original music by David Carbonara, intermixed with popular songs from the 1960s.  No one watches television for the brilliant dialogue anyway.  Weiner ultimately gets a pass because he has shown that he is quite willing to jettison characters who have lost their way, as he does at the end of Season Three when he dumps almost the entire staff of the original Sterling Cooper and several prominent characters.  I was very glad to see the end of the obnoxious Paul Kinsey who served no other purpose in the series than  to pout and puff himself up.

I'd also love to see Weiner ease out the horrid Betty Draper, played by the empty-headed, ice-queen January Jones.  So she looks like Grace Kelly, is that why they hired her for this crucial role?  She is a horrible actress and is incapable of pronouncing contractions like 'wouldn't', 'shouldn't', 'couldn't' and ,didn't'.  In her mouth these words come out invariably as 'wuhnt', 'shuhnt', 'cuhnt' and 'dint'.  No one talked like that until recently and most of those people simply can't communicate beyond the constant use of text-messaging.  Jones should be written out of the show as soon as possible.  Her character is awful enough without having to listen to her terrible delivery of the lines.  Ms Jones is the other bad actor in this show who is receiving lots of accolades for her work.

The irony is that most of the rest of the cast is brilliant.  The others manage to make Jon Hamm look good so he can stay, but no one can save Jones from herself.

The best acting comes from Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olson) and Vincent Kartheiser (Peter Campbell).  There is also the ab-fab Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway-Harris.  Her rendition of 'C'est magnifique!' accompanying herself on her red accordion is one of the highlights of the entire series so far.  Those three deserve awards, not the pretty faced empty-heads at the top of the cast list.  How can a show survive with such weak leads?  It's just another fascinating conundrum that keeps me watching.  Will Don Draper survive?  The show could certainly go on without him.  Sometimes I wish it would.
I am heartily sick and tired of his goat-like sex-drive.  The way he's going I'm afraid he's going to end up in his own private Lost Weekend when the potential for far more interesting avenues is open to his character.

Weiner makes a big deal out of Ayn Rand's great novel Atlas Shrugged.  If he really understands that masterful science-fiction/philosophic book he'd be making much more interesting situations for these characters.  As it is Weiner seems content to simply show us how selfish, greedy, bitchy, drunken, bigoted and cruel business people were (are), which puts this show into the huge pile of television shows that live and die by political correctness and ignorance of the facts of history.  If this is the way it's going to go it will be a pity and the show won't go past Season Five.  Season Four seems to be doing well but only the die-hard fanatics are reporting in so far.

Suggestions:
Let Betty run off with her new ghastly husband, the vile political lawyer, Henry.  Good riddance, but let Don keep those two marvelous kids, Sally and Bobby, played with humorous aplomb and startling naturalness by Kiernan Shipka and Jared S. Gilmore.

One last plea, to the sound man.  Please resist the temptation to put the microphones down the actors' throats, especially when they are snogging in bed.  The disgusting slurping and smacking is so loud that all ambient noise, like Evenrude-powered window-unit air-conditioners, passing diesel locomotives and New York traffic jams, is drowned out by smacking lips and over-extended panting, like Don's just run the one minute mile or something.  I'm glad middle-aged people have sex but these miking policies would make it difficult to sit through the sexual antics of the most nubile studs and lasses Hollywood could offer up.

I hope Mad Men gets better.  Season One hadn't found itself yet. Season Two hit a nice stride except for the Betty Draper side lines which always slowed the shows down.  Season Three was hobbled by a particularly obnoxious trollop named Suzanne Farrell, a neurotic school teacher and aboriginal hippie in the making.  Don falls for her hillbilly ways, because he's a hillbilly, remember.  Far too much celluloid was wasted on their affair and it went piffle at the end, contributing little or nothing to the whole.

The last two episodes of Season Three were superb, aside from January Jones.  Even Jon Hamm improved with the better scripts, not to mention the direction of Barbet Schroeder in the next to last episode that involved the assassination of JFK.  The best scripts are all centered around huge traumatic social events, like the Nixon/Kennedy election, JFK assassination and the Cuban Missile Crisis, a terrifying period of time that I remember vividly; I was about Sally Draper's age at the time.  Oh, that reminds me.  Weiner, lose your kid from the series.  Little Glenn Bishop (played by Martin Weiner) is the creepiest little bedbug I've ever encountered in a television show.  Pugsly Addams has nothing on this bizarre child.

Mad Men is grand soap opera, like Dallas and Dynasty, but hyper realistic in an alternative universe sort-of-way.  So I am content to continue watching faithfully to the bitter end just in the hopes of hearing Christina Hendricks play her accordion  again.  C'est magnifique!",1279843200,2,7911,4.821216617210682

I love the Video on Demand feature on Amazon, but it is frustrating that you cannot do basic closed captioning on any downloaded product.  We have three wonderful but very loud children.  If they are awake in any room in the house, it is impossible to hear a dialogue-based show like MM without the help of the subtitles.  I understand they are attempting to keep the file sizes small so that the downloads don't take long, but they should provide an option.

3948679,4,B002LITRJ4,"I assume that you already know and love Mad Men if you are looking at the Season Three box set, so I won't waste time describing the plot of this series.

The season comes in a three-part casing, which includes a hard outer shell, an inside slide-out half-cover, and the casing for the actual DVDs. Fortunately, the packaging artists have listened to the criticism of past sets and learned from prior mistakes. Each portion fits snugly into the next piece (the DVD sleeve into the slip cover into the hard shell), so the DVDs don't rattle around in any way. The DVDs snap into individual slots (no sliding) and don't overlap (so you don't have to remove two disks to only watch one).

The promo art (including that picture of Don's office filling up with water) is incorporated on the innermost casing. Virtually everyone relevant to this season's important arcs is represented, save for Lane Pryce (played by Jared Harris).

The only thing worth deducting a star (and I would really only deduct a half, if you could) from the set for is the slightly lacking special features. There are audio commentaries on each episode, but you need to actually put the DVD in your player to see who's on each one--the box doesn't tell you. Other features include an audio recording of MLK Jr.'s ""I Have A Dream"" speech with a picture gallery and a history of cigarette advertising, which make for an interesting historical lesson, but reveal little about the series.

Once again we find Don Draper struggling to hide his past but this time the past catches up. Betty, tired of always being second to Don's job or wondering eye, starts to eye a guy of her own.  Salvatore Romano sexuality comes into question. Joan quits Sterling Cooper and tries to adapt to domestic life with her new husband. Rodger Sterling finds himself having to defend his marriage to the much younger Jane to all his friends and coworkers.  Peggy has become such an asset at Sterling Copper that she is actively being poached by Duck Phillips at a rival add agency, Grey.  Pete Campbell is also trying to ward off being poached by Duck Phillips and still struggles with the lack of appreciation from his coworkers at Sterling Cooper. As for Sterling Cooper itself, the company stands and shaky ground after being acquired by Puttnam, Powell and Lowe of London.  Now splash in some affairs, cocktails, glamour and scheming and you got one heck of a great season.",1276992000,,1102,4.694300518134715

Don is gone most of the time, doing as he pleases, though he forbids his wife to do the same.  The Draper kids get more screen time as well.

At the end of Season 2, he had a brilliant line about looking at his life, ""scratching at it, trying to get in."" I don't think his efforts quite met the challenge of that statement.

Season 3 addresses many intriguing questions...

Can Roger ever act like a grown-up?

How long can Peggy play the wide-eyed ingenue? (girl's been around...)

Will Joan ever trade feminine wiles for Girl Power?

Will Pete ever be half good enough for Trudi? (Probably not--though she continues to be annoying in this season, she gets more awesome in every scene)

How nasty can a show's portrayal of the English be before it becomes some kind of media hate-crime?

Does Cooper ever forget anything that he can later use to his own advantage?

Can this show do more with racism than use it to characterize the principals?

Wouldn't it be great to be Ken Cosgrove? (spoiler alert: yes)

3948706,5,B002LITRJ4,"This for me was the best season so far of this absorbing series and it reached a brilliant and shattering climax with the murder of JFK. Of course, every viewer knew this was coming. The question was, how would the writers handle it. The answer is that they managed to absorb this pivotal event in U.S. history with extraordinary subtlety and sensitivity, absorbing it into the fabric of the drama in a totally seamless way.

The central character of Mad Men is Donald Draper, played brilliantly by Jon Hamm. Season by season, we gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity of this brilliant character and the emptiness of his inner life which he is constantly trying to fill. We learn more about the childhood traumas that have made Draper the man he is -- and how nothing -- neither his job nor his beautiful wife, nor his kids, nor his constant philandering -- can compensate for the spiritual void at the center of his soul. Draper is a superb creation on a par with Tony Soprano.

Others in the cast are also wonderful. Draper's wife Betty, an ice queen, has her own needs which Draper seems incapable of meeting. Her kids, especially the oldest girl Sally, are also coming into focus as characters in their own right. And the large cast of characters at the ad agency provides tremendous range and variety.

3948719,4,B002LITRJ4,"Season 3 starts off a bit shaky.  The first 6 episodes are more like short stories, without necessarily being linked to each other.  But the over-arching theme of Season 3 can be likened to the fall of Rome.  These men who are currently at the top of the world do not know the major changes that will affect them.  For men like Don Draper & Roger Sterling, issues like the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War are on the periphery of their lives.  But, the viewer is shown that the domestic lives, as well as the life of the country, are thrown for a loop.

While much of the emphasis on Season 3 is on Don Draper, we do see major changes in the characters of Pete Campbell, Peggy Olsen, Joan Halloway, & Roger Sterling.  Bert Cooper, who is usually shown as an eccentric old man, gets to display a killer instinct at unsuspecting times.

In sum, it's a profound and character-driven affair that yields new delights with every viewing.  And Weiner's commentary tracks are, as usual, top-notch.

3948727,5,B002LITRJ4,"No cable in this not so recession proof household.  We have our favorite shows that don't come via the four major networks and it's cheaper to buy the DVDs than pay a cable company $70 or so every month.  ""Mad Men"" is one of about five of my ""must have"" titles.  As a very low echelon advertising geek for many years, ""Mad Men"" gives me an insight into the lives of the hotshots in the ad game.  Being very familiar with advertising in the sixties, but from a newspaper perspective, some elements run true.  Dressing up was true, even for a worker bee like me.  (I think the worker bees are guys; they slave for the queen bees--just a way of saying I am male.)  I think ties were about one inch wide then and pretty drab.  I wore a very wide bright blue and yellow striped number to work one day and was actually sent home to change.  Same thing happened with a pale blue dress shirt.  Shirt had to be crisp and white.

The real pain with these cable shows (also, for example, ""Dexter"") is the gap between ""seasons.""  It was so long a wait for me before the season three ""Mad Men"" DVD came out, I really felt out of touch with the plot line.  Once I had my order in for season three, I pulled out the first two seasons and immersed myself in the eight disks, going through one or two disks each night (I am retired).  Being of this era, and of its history, I totally lost myself in reliving that halcyon time of my life (it seems so because, after all, I was young).  ""Mad Men"" proceeds at such a leisurely pace one becomes enveloped in not only the story but the lifestyle as well.  The homes, the clothes, smoking and drinking without guilt (""major"" guilt), the cars, the bars and, I suppose, the endless bed-hopping.  I worked in newspaper advertising for the latter half of the sixties and with an agency from 1990 into the 21st century.  ""Mad Men"" focuses on the behavior of what I believe were a minority of those in high (and not-so-high places).  I'm referring, of course, to the massive amounts of fornication ""Mad Men"" implies was so absolutely routine.  To be fair, the creator primarily suggests the most aggressive womanizing is by a very small number of top agency executives.  To be fair, how many executives of any business report their crimes and misdemeanors to the workers?  To be honest, there's always the water cooler.

This is pretty much a generic review of the entire series because I did immerse myself in all three seasons over something like ten or so nights.  The seasons of ""Mad Men,"" like the seasons of the year, flow seamlessly together.  I believe each season has ended with a cliffhanger of sorts but season three, without spoiling anything, felt challenging and, therefore possibly more upbeat than seasons one or two.  Season three really does help establish the peripheral characters and their stories in the ""Mad Men"" saga.  The first disk, again without revealing plots, left me tweeting about creator Matthew Weiner having completely lost his vision for the series.  By the second disk, all was right with the world again--and wrong with Sterling, Cooper Advertising.  Which is what we viewers expect, and want.  Season three is a tumultuous ride because, of course, the agency has been acquired by an international advertising force.  If advertising is a world where you have a job one day and are hunting for one the next, Sterling, Cooper's merger escalates this trauma both individually and within the overall scope of its little universe.

I've given it five stars not merely because I grew to adulthood and finished a formal working life in this particular sphere of influence but because the drama is real, the characters are true and any viewer can relate and enter into the experience for about 45 minutes each week.  Regrettably, for only about 13 weeks.  And, for those of us who wait, we still have summer 2010 ahead with season four of ""Mad Men"" and we will twiddle our thumbs until the spring of 2011 when the season four DVD is finally released.  We would have it no other way. One 45 minute episode, and leaving us hanging for a week -- I'll take my medicine one season, one big dose at a time.

One lingering lament in this rather poor review (if you wanted story details): The first season ""Mad Men"" DVD package was unlike any I've ever seen.  The set arrived in the form of a ""flip open"" silver grey Zippo lighter.  After months of waiting for season two, I made a poor decision to get a little extra cash by selling off some of my too large DVD collection.  Selling season one of ""Mad Men"" was a mortal sin.

A brilliant, well-crafted series, this latest season sees new character development, compelling story arcs and wonderfully well-written and acted episodes that are engaging, humorous, believable and witty.

I'm a big fan of 60's tv shows (Wild Wild West, IDOJ, ST:TOS, The Saint, Avengers), and movies (Sinatra/Helm/007), and this brings back that golden era in a contemporary, well-designed series that's believable and engaging.  I like the story arc w/Hilton, and Don's response to increasing pressure as his success at work builds.

While everybody writes it it must be repeated, the writing acting and direction is superb. While Season Two was at times m ore dark and sinister, Season Two despite being somewhat less weird has not lost its touch. We get to follow the partners of a very successful Madison Avenue advertising agency during the eraly 60's and we see the impact of the Kennedy assasination on these career-oriented people.

3948735,5,B002LITRJ4,"The third season of MAD MEN, the extraordinarily well written and carefully researched historical AMC television drama, comes across much better on DVD than it did when it was originally airing episodically. The DVD set (again arranged in a different package format from previous seasons) allows us to get a stronger sense of the sweep of changes the show's creator, Matt Weiner, and his associates depict in the world of Sterling-Cooper, their fictional 1960s advertising agency.

The season begins with a joke on ""the British invasion"": Sterling-Cooper has been acquired by Powell, Putnam and Lowe, a giant London-based international agency, which has placed a major new character, the sardonic Lane Pryce (the marvelous Jared Harris) as the New York firm's new financial officer. Don and Betty Draper, the series' major characters, have reaffirmed their commitment to one another through Betty's pregnancy with a third child, and in the first episode Betty's gruff father Gene Hofstadt (Ryan Cutrona, equally excellent) has had a stroke and must come to live with his daughter's family in Ossining. The genius of the series is its richness of detail both in period flavor and in the depth of the characters: much is left unsaid that speaks volumes about the players and the times, and its great to have an American series that doesn't tell us everything outright that's going on. It also allows for lovely moments of great beauty: a children's maypole dance, a drug-induced dream about a caterpillar, a nighttime view of the Sterling-Cooper bullpen late at night empty and abandoned. The season documents tremendous changes in American society in the crucial year of 1963: the ongoing Civil Rights movement, the change in attitudes towards gender and sexuality, and inevitably the assassination of JFK (which is handled with originality).

The most difficult thing about the new season is that the characters of Don and Betty seem to be caught in a revolving door with their old problems and squabbles: Don is dishonest and cheats on Betty constantly, and Betty will not be happy with what her husband provides for her (which he thought was all that was expected of him). Yet the repetition of their tensions was almost inherent in the show's very structure, leading to this season finale's refreshing possibilities for new beginnings for both characters, which will be essential given that while they are both highly attractive and accomplished people neither of them are especially compelling now their depths (or rather their shallownesses) have been thoroughly plumbed. (Even so, Jon Hamm continues to give an especially intelligent performance as Don, showing us he's a much more complex person than the character himself is.) Much more intriguing are the series' other characters, including the Drapers' lisping daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka), on whom nothing is lost; their tight-lipped housekeeper Carla (Deborah Lacy, in a remarkably subtle ongoing performance), who also sees everything the Drapers are up to; and Don's ambitious young associate Pete Campbell and his intelligent wife Trudy (respectively, Vincent Kartheiser and Allison Brie).

The production values, as usual, are astonishing, and the use of music by David Carbonara is one of the series's greatest strengths. The DVD set comes with features such as documentaries on the March on Washington and the murder of Medgar Evers (both of which are key events in the season's timeline), and multiple episode commentaries, including many by Weiner, who is more intelligent and articulate (though no less chronically self-congratulatory) than many other cable series creators.",1270857600,,3648,5.307958477508651
3948736,5,B002LITRJ4,"Cheers to Matt Weiner, AMC, the staff and cast of Mad Men for another great season with hours of entertainment!!  Mad Men is a wonderfully crafted show with incredible attention to detail.  It's also one of those shows that you either get or you don't.  To all of the people who say that nothing happens on Mad Men, my answer is that so many things are happening that you need to watch carefully to see it all.  If you are a person who appreciates superbly nuanced writing, great cinematography and acting, your attention will be rewarded.  This is a thinking person's show, educating its audience not only about the sixties, but also about today.  Just remember to start from Season 1.

My only disappointment with the Season 3 DVD set is that I was hoping for some behind the scenes extras, such as extended scenes or out-takes.  I guess they're saving that stuff to sell a future compilation set.",1270512000,2,899,4.610062893081761

I preordered it in October 2009 and ended up paying a price of $28.99 when I received it just a few days ago.  An $11 reduction immediately?  What a slap in the face to loyal amazon.com customers and ""Mad Men"" fans.  I thought amazon.com had more class and respect for their customers -- was I wrong?  I understand that amazon.com does not making any pricing promises (see their pricing policies if you want) but this seems to be an especially callous way to treat loyal customers.  Couldn't they at least have waited a while before lowering the price so drastically?  DON'T BOTHER TO PRE-ORDER SEASON 4 OF ""MAD MEN"" FROM AMAZON.COM:  the lesson seems to be that those who pre-order are taken advantage of, and those who wait will get the best price.

3948740,5,B002LITRJ4,"Mad Men remains a show that rewards careful viewing. How much you'll like it depends on how important it is to you that there are explosions and car chases. Me, I zone out during action sequences in movies -- it's the weirdest thing. Sports too. What interests me and what Mad Men provides is good story-telling centered around characters. The more you pay attention, the more you'll be rewarded in a greater understanding that will make you confused when someone tells you that nothing happens. This is the type of show that rewards people who take a geeky pleasure in noticing themes and motifs. Matthew Weiner, the creator, allows some things to remain ambiguous as well.

There are so few shows that you can watch more than once and find something new and few shows you can analyze. It's just as fun to discuss it afterwards as it is to watch it. If this sounds too much like high school English -- and not in a good way -- then you'd be better off taking a pass. However, if this is the type of show you seek out, then enjoy. If you haven't seen the previous seasons, start there and enjoy it from the beginning. I'll envy you your opportunity to enjoy three seasons in a row!

In season three, we continue to deal with the Draper marriage -- a union strained to nearly the breaking point in season 2. There was some really beautiful writing and acting here. One of the beauties of this show is how in the course of a scene a viewer's sympathies can change or be torn between characters. The marriage between Pete and Trudy shows some terrific growth and depth that could not have been predicted in season 1. Don Draper also meets a mogul who is probably rolling in his grave over the second most famous thing the family name now evokes. Sal, played by Bryan Batt, has several wonderful scenes, starting with the first episode of the season. Kiernan Shipka, who plays Sally Draper, is turning out to be a talented young actress, as highlighted in an episode called The Arrangements, as well as in the season finale. Frankly, I could just continue mentioning members of this terrific cast, as they all are a pleasure.

The Kennedy assassination is featured and handled in a way never seen before, I think, and it's one character's reaction to it and events surrounding it that causes him/her/it to make a truly huge decision.

On to the Bluray: I had to return the first copy as defective -- no matter what I hit, it wanted to rewind. Fortunately, the next copy was perfect, and Amazon has always handled returns well. Because this is a show that caters to people who want to really enjoy the writing and acting and to even study it a little, this set carries on in the tradition of previous seasons in offering tons of commentary -- most episodes have two commentaries. As always, some people really do a better job that others. The creator, Matthew Weiner, always has good insights. Kiernan Shipka, I'm not kidding, seemed to really be in touch with her character in a way that many adults can only envy. Other extras are a mixed bag, although I enjoyed the 2 part doc on cigarette advertising.

Love this show!",1269734400,37,3117,4.549019607843137
3948741,5,B002LITRJ4,"Mad Men brillantly brings us back to the 60s.  Billy Wilder exposed this in THE APARTMENT, but MAD MEN goes even deeper. Jews, Negroes, and other 'outsiders' had no chance for success in the WASPY firms forcing them to create their own companies (MAD MEN alludes to Grey Advertising as the ""Jewish"" firm).  And women...either barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen or the ""bitch"" in the office next door (who either screwed her way to the top or is a lesbian).  I came to the business world in the mid-70s and unfortunately little had changed.  My bosses were married to women who took care of the kids and lived an emptiness beyond that.  Their new young female employees (often forced on them due to women's lib)exhibited a level of confidence they never saw in women before, which only added to their appeal. Vibrant, smart, confident with a sexy body, the bosses could not take their female recruits seriously. Sad to say, but I think MAD MEN captures the attitude of the 60s, 70s and early 80s (some would say even longer)!",1269734400,,1027,4.651933701657459

But three episodes of all thirteen excellent chapters of Season Three are exemplary for their use of period pop music cleverly connected to the story. Specifically, ""Sixteen Tons"" when Don signs his contract,
""The End Of The World"" after the Kennedy Assasination,  and the flip side of Roy Orbison's classic ""In Dreams"", ""Shahdaroba"", as the new agency starts up - WOW!  As the closing credits roll on these episodes, I sat mesmerized by these nostalgic songs from music history of the era.  They are the perfect endings to magical entertainment.

3948749,5,B002LITRJ4,"I watched the first two episodes of Mad Men season 3 last night with great interest. Shown on the BBC it had no commercial breaks and lasted an hour and a half. I have tried to think of what's different about this current run and I think it's become more soap opera and less insight into the world of Madison Avenue in the 50s and 60s. Less flair. It was always the creative haven, the man's world of invention and contention that excited me.

I have always enjoyed the way the camera moves in the first two seasons. Now the editing seems far more regular soap. The struggles of Peggy and Joan are fascinating. Each in their own domain. But it is the introduction of the British take-over that is a fundamental shift in Mad Men perspectives.

Was America overmanned? Is America overmanned? So far this is the only analogy that can justify the Brit angle. The cultural British invasion of the 1960s, so far at least, is not readily apparent in the storyline.

Competing forces. Change in the air. Social conviviality (the bar room scene where Peggy picks up her date, an excellent example). These are the strengths of Mad Men. To show and not to tell of liberalism, expansion and responsibility.

Mad Men is up there with the best television ever produced anywhere. The first two seasons were some of the best cinema as well. I hope you don't kill the individuals in the following eleven episodes. That would be failure.

Looking forward to Wednesday nights in New York city.

'The Fog' passed so quickly. The complexities of child bearing and child rearing shown with dreamscapes and surreal touches which seem to embrace the whole experience in just forty five minutes. Brilliant. Don resists teacher's temptation, Peggy steals her ambition, Pete's ignorance spills over his frustration. The Prison officer glides past Don in the hospital ward where they seemed to have bonded so well. Reality is a hard place.

I take back my comment about soap opera inclinations, the flair and imagination in that one episode was worthy of a poem. A poem I had not read.",1264636800,3,2057,4.713091922005571

3948751,3,B002LITRJ4,"I bought this Season 3 collection but, to me, at least three episodes in MM S3 left me ""underwhelmed."" In contrast, there were a minimum of, and arguably no, clunkers in S1 and S2.  Randomly watch and S1 episode (or even the great pilot--one of the best I've seen--and made before the production even got its footing!) and compare.  There was some storyline slippage in S3.

Too much of the focus in S3 was on Betty (and the protracted Betty-Henry storyline--yawn), and not enough on the more interesting agency characters, though January Jones brings a lot of credibility to her role as Betty.  Maybe as a man, I'm prejudiced, but scenes where people hold each other and talk about their feelings in a way that does not advance the story or give depth to the characters belong on TV during the day, not at night after 10 p.m.  For example, the Don-Suzanne Ferrell plot line had potential, but unlike the Tony S.-Gloria Trillo affair in The Sopranos, went nowhere.  Maybe they should have stayed ""platonic with potential.""

If S1 and S2 earn five stars, S3 earns three.  The writing and pacing ebbs and flows. Writing crew brought it home the last couple of episodes of S3, and until then I was concerned about the decline of the show.  10 of 13 episodes were still very good and a few of these 10 were great.",1264464000,4,1309,4.55982905982906

Mad Men is truly an excellently produced show on all levels, as should be evident from it's adament fans, critical praise and many awards. The first season established the world and introduced the characters, the second season expanded and elaborated on each and the third season finally presents a complete vision. The third season doesn't have quite the same punch of the first season, nor does it have the exploration of the second. What it does have is a nice combination of many elements. After all the anticipation and two seasons of building up this season things began to happen, it was also a season with more comedic elements tossed into the mix after the seriousness of season two. If you watch this show you'll want to buy this set to catch nuances you've missed in the first viewing and if you haven't seen this show catch it on AMC or buy the first season because now is the time to immerse yourself in the well crafted world of Mad Men.

This season contains the following 13 episodes:

Out of Town
Love Among the Ruins
My Old Kentucky Home
The Arrangements
The Fog
Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency
Seven Twenty Three
Souvenir
Wee Small Hours
The Color Blue
The Gypsy and the Hobo
The Grown Ups
Shut the Door, Have a Seat

This three disc Blu-Ray set will be released on March 23rd, I'm glad they're not making us wait until July like last year when they wanted the second season release to coincide with the third season television premiere. The episodes will be presented in 1080p resolution widescreen video and likely English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. English and Spanish subtitles will also be included. Closed Captioning doesn't seem to be included on the Blu-Ray but is found on the DVD, I presume the producers of these sets thought vision impaired purchasers wouldn't care about the picture quality of the episodes. The set will also include the following special features:

Mad Men Commmentaries: As with previous seasons cast and crew will provide audio commentaries on the episodes, in the past commentaries have been included on each season episode with some episodes having more than one commentary option.

Medgar Evers: The Patriarch. The Activist. The Hero - A documentary that explores the life of the Civil Rights Pioneer who believed in a better way of life for all through equality and the end of segregation.

Up In Smoke: A visual depiction of the juxtaposition between the world of advertising and big tabaco in the 40's, 50's, 60's and today.

We Shall Overcome: The March on Washington - Dr. Martin Luther King's speech accompanied by images detailing the historic moment when over 250 000 people who marched on Washington.

Mad Men Illustrated - Dyna Moe gives commentary leading you through the ""animated"" photo gallery of Mad Men illustrations.

Flashback 1963: An interactive look back at the events and themes that defined that year.

All in all you're getting a lot of special features by the time you add up all the, always in the past, insightful commentaries with the amount of featurettes on the sixties. These features are great for those interested in the era of Mad Men and I've always been one who enjoys a good commentary but I must say I'm still upset at the lack of behind the scenes special features. No actual interviews with the cast, crew or writer's of this fine series. No 'on set' or 'behind the scenes' looks, no journey into the writing room to see how they designed this crucial season. I'm not saying the special features they are providing aren't great though, just that personally I'd love to learn more about how the show itself is made and that hopefully they will announce more features before this season is released.

Five Stars for the quality of these episodes after having seen them on television and for the quality I'm sure we can expect the Blu-Ray episodes to be in, this show looks magnificent on Blu-Ray. Also five stars for the amount of bonus features they continue to include, which are always interesting despite not being as much about the show production as I'd personally like (I still hope that will change). Ultimately Mad Men is a great show that most people can find something to enjoy about and this season is crucial as it's the one where things have started falling apart. It's like the season three ending song Shadaroba says, ""the future will be better than the past"", and while things may get worse for the characters of Mad Men, certainly before they get any better, we can bet that the future of this show will only get better. Fans know this show is amazing and those who haven't tried it yet should before the fourth season really shakes things up. Thanks for your time.",1261526400,9,4741,4.740291262135922

Shut the Door, Have a Seat

This four disc DVD set will be released on March 23rd, I'm glad they're not making us wait until July like last year when they wanted the second season DVD release to coincide with the third season television premiere. The episodes will be presented in Anamorphic Widescreen video. English 5.1 Dolby Digital and English 2.0 Dolby Digital Audio options as well as English and Spanish subtitles. Closed Captioning will also be included. The set will also include the following special features:

Mad Men Commmentaries: As with previous seasons cast and crew will provide audio commentaries on the episodes, in the past commentaries have been included on each season episode with some episodes having more than one commentary option.

Medgar Evers: The Patriarch. The Activist. The Hero - A documentary that explores the life of the Civil Rights  Pioneer who believed in a better way of life for all through equality and the end of segregation.

Up In Smoke: A visual depiction of the juxtaposition between the world of advertising and big tabaco in the 40's, 50's, 60's and today.

We Shall Overcome: The March on Washington - Dr. Martin Luther King's speech accompanied by images detailing the historic moment when over 250 000 people who marched on Washington.

Mad Men Illustrated - Dyna Moe gives commentary leading you through the ""animated"" photo gallery of Mad Men illustrations.

Flashback 1963: An interactive look back at the events and themes that defined that year.

All in all you're getting a lot of special features by the time you add up all the, always in the past, insightful commentaries with the amount of featurettes on the sixties. These features are great for those interested in the era of Mad Men and I've always been one who enjoys a good commentary but I must say I'm still upset at the lack of behind the scenes special features. No actual interviews with the cast, crew or writer's of this fine series. No 'on set' or 'behind the scenes' looks, no journey into the writing room to see how they designed this crucial season. I'm not saying the special features they are providing aren't great though, just that personally I'd love to learn more about how the show itself is made and that hopefully they will announce more features before this season is released.

Five Stars for the quality of these episodes after having seen them on television and for the quality I'm sure we can expect the DVD episodes to be in based on how great past seasons have looked on DVD. Also five stars for the amount of bonus features they continue to include, which are always interesting despite not being as much about the show production as I'd personally like (I still hope that will change). Ultimately Mad Men is a great show that most people can find something to enjoy about and this season is crucial as it's the one where things have started falling apart. It's like the season three ending song Shadaroba says, ""the future will be better than the past"", and while things may get worse for the characters of Mad Men, certainly before they get any better, we can bet that the future of this show will only get better. Fans know this show is amazing and those who haven't tried it yet should before the fourth season really shakes things up. Thanks for your time.",1261440000,7,4583,4.70661672908864
3948757,2,B002LITRJ4,"At the end of season two Don Draper was going through a soul-searching crisis. Suddenly, I found him more empathetic and interesting, so I was really looking forward to season three. I was disappointed. Don became the same unlikeable character he was in season one and most of season two.

I just don't understand how a series with so many unlikeable characters - all the men - became so popular.

Not once did any of the men, or even Peggy, express their love for advertising, for helping people buy the right product; so I'm left to conclude that the only thing that drives these selfish people is money and sex.

Also, I found it hard to believe that Peggy, after the way she was treated by Don, made the decision she did at the end of the season.

Finally, I was disappointed the Connolly's adoption story line was dropped. To me, it seemed real and meaningful, something I could identify with.

Still, there are things about this series I like, the acting, Betty Draper, much of the diologue, and the ""look"" of the Sixties.

In the end, I want characters I can root for.",1261267200,15,1075,4.515463917525773

I have been hooked on Mad Men since watching the first episode the day it premiered. Love it! Everyone should see it from the beginning. If you have not yet done it, purchase season one and two and watch them, then get this the minute it is available.

I dissagree with Mr. Cyber. Season 3 was just as good as 1 & 2. It started a bit slow but got much better and the finale was the best finale of all three seasons so far. Can't wait to see what happens next year!",1261180800,2,565,3.956140350877193

I do recommend going through Seasons 1 and 2  before starting 3 because each season builds upon the other. In this most current season, Don Draper becomes unmasked and his world spins out of control. JFK is killed...the innocent 60's are starting to hurdle to the ""summer of love""... Go along the ride with Don, Betty and the whole Advertising Gang. Full of laughs, drama and just plain surreal stuff, Mad Men is like watching a painting come to life. I have to give a big shout out to little Sally because she's just the best eight year-old anti hero ever. BRAVO on a stellar Season. MORE! More!",1260748800,2,715,4.458015267175573
3948763,5,B002LITRJ4,"the writing was superb once again, and the show has the acting chops to carry it through.  mad men is a happy marriage of quality in writing and acting, sadly lacking in most other shows.  this season didn't necessarily have the ""bang"" of the 1st one, but i loved the subtle nuances of the characters and their relationships.  the finale was exciting and it definitely left you impatient for the start of season 4.  the show is unpredictable...as a viewer, you can't assume too much about a storyline, as they take interesting arcs and sideturns, but this is a good thing.  don draper is the quintessential alpha male, and you root for him even when he does detestable things.  betty, the automaton housewife, comes out of her shell more this season than in past seasons, but in her controlled way.  i generally tend to feel more sympathy for don than betty, which is probably by design...don't you just want to give don a great big bear hug?  betty is not exactly the source of the warmth he needs in his life.  i get the feeling she has depth somewhere, but it's hard to find through the superficiality that she seems to personify.  don didn't marry her for her person so much as what she represented to him, and she surely has realized that and much more with the revelations found in that nondescript shoe box.  there were so many great moments.  and you've got to love joan.  is there anyone more capable than joan?  i have a feeling her hubs is going to see some (bad) action in vietnam in the future, but who knows (that's the beauty)?  the other supporting characters are ALL just as rich: peggy, pete, roger, and the rest.  i hope sal makes an appearance at the new agency, too.  all in all, worth every minute of your time.",1258588800,3,1733,4.485623003194888

The first episode of season one was the best. Everyone smoking all the time, cocktail hour anytime of the day, big tobacco companies were king.
The best line was when Don Draper said to Pete Campbell "" Pete, I had a report just like that one and it's not like there is a magic machine that makes identical copies"". How nostalgic is that? I think as we get older we long to live in the past and I would do the sixties all over again.
It is just the best show ever and the writing is so exceptional that I hang on every word.",1258329600,2,674,4.037313432835821
3948766,5,B002LITRJ4,"*Spoilers ahead.  Just warning you!*

For all the fans and true ""Mad Men"" addicts out there, Season 3 was much-anticipated.  At the end of Season 2, we had reason to believe that Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the charismatic creative director of Sterling-Cooper, had come to his place of reckoning and was ready to turn a new leaf (sorry for all the cliches) in his marriage, if not his career.  His gorgeous, emotionally stunted wife Betty (January Jones) just found out she was pregnant, and they apparently decide to mend their marriage and try to make a go of it.  Presumably, women didn't have many choices back in the '60's.  Also, Betty just might be that kind of woman - she needs a man to complete her.

But right from the beginning of Season 3, the viewer can see that not much has changed at all, and Don is off being the bad boy again.  Betty seems in a world of her own with her pregnancy, and then her father's decline in health and the subsequent decisions that have to made give her all she can apparently cope with.  I found myself growing angry at her numerous times because of her cold, unfeeling treatment of her adorable children.  Even with all his immaturity, Don seems to be the far more caring parent, at least while face-to-face with his children.  Sally Draper, their little girl, had some of the best acting of the season, and I think she will mature into a terrific actress.

So much happens on the career front, it would be a mistake to give it all away in a review.  I heard complaints from various people that Season 3 was too slow -- but remember that this is a show about character development and nuance, above all.  The last two episodes, about the Kennedy assassination and the Season finale, are as action-packed as any plot lover could want.  They are magnificently written and acted, and left this viewer, at least, panting for Season 4.  What more can a series offer?",1258156800,49,1901,4.514619883040936
3948767,5,B002LITRJ4,"From day one, this show has not disappointed.  It has some of the best writing and acting that Hollywood has produced for a television show in a long time and it has the awards to prove it.  It's a highly stylized look at a Madison Avenue advertising agency and the people who work there and has been extremely enjoyable.  Season 3 has had the best writing and acting and the last 3 episodes have been the best out of all 39 episodes produced to date.  You cannot truly appreciate season 3 without watching seasons 1 and 2 so if you are new to the series, please do yourself a favor and watch them before consuming season 3, you will not be disappointed.",1257811200,79,654,4.336065573770492

As a consequence, the story line gets dynamic especially in the last episodes that i already can't wait to see the next season. however, inbetween, for sure i will take the dvds and enjoy mad men's metamorphoses once again. so congratualtions from germany to this finest piece of entertainment !",1257811200,,735,5.133333333333334

8373162,5,B002LITRJ4,"There really isn't anything better than Mad Men on television and there probably never will be. The writing is true perfection.

There are lines here so classically attuned to this specific time period that are mint. They catch you off guard like the scene where Sterling (who is just the best!) is getting another drink and his ex-wife starts to scold him, and Sterling very quickly cuts her off by saying ""we're not married anymore.""--this is just hilarious :) his timing and affect so pitch perfect. This is only one example out of thousands of clever quips and lines.

I cannot say enough good things about this series. It really is like going back in time and reliving my grandparents era--one I wish I had been born into instead of today's world.

Margaret played by Elizabeth Moss is hands down my favorite character. She is living the ad copy life I wistfully wanted to follow. As per usual, the old boys club is barring the way for her upward mobility. Probably the worst thing for women in the workplace at that time. She is so brave and honest. This is some of the finest acting around.

Don Draper and his entire family, from wife Betsy to father-in-law Eugene, and daughter Sally are such a joy to watch. And as the seasons progress one watches their lives growing and unfolding.

I could literally watch this entire series every single day and find new details to pick out that I had missed before. Mad Men is so complex and rich in flavor and heritage.

I love it! And want to say a giant Thanks to ALL of these Outstanding Actors and Actresses and Writers and Producers for bringing a piece of my grandparents back to me!!! Thank you for returning to a time in America that yes, was contentious; yet still, so golden open and yawning with wide eyed prosperity.
