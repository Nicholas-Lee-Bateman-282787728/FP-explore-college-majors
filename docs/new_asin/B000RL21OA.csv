2868765,5,B000RL21OA,"I'm fast becoming a fan of Leslie Sansones.  Each dvd I get of hers is superb and this is also really great.  It's easy to do and still will give you results.  She's energetic (which makes me feel energetic) and encouraging and she makes her workouts fun.
This has really easy movements that anyone can do, and you can choose to use weights or not.  If you use the light weights, then you burn more calories and tone up your arms at the same time.  I love how the exercisers are real people of all different shapes.  All of the three segments are equivalent to one mile of walking outside - so it's so beneficial if it's too hot, cold or wet outside.  You start of slow and then go quicker in the second segment.  Then, the final segment is a little slower again because you are focusing more on doing toning for your upper body.
All you really need is either weights or little weighted balls and some energy and a little bit of space.  This is such a fun routine where you are done before you know it, and yet have had a great workout that burns calories and gets you into shape.  I really love this and recommend it for practically everyone.",1190160000,17,1143,4.274418604651163
2868766,5,B000RL21OA,"This is a great new workout from Leslie Sansone. I have many of her previous DVD's and this one is a must-buy. The studio is a big improvement over the recent Walk Slim series (which are also great workouts, by the way!). The studio there was dark and pretty gloomy(!) but this DVD has a bright, cheery background. The cardio workout is excellent and this routine also incorporates weights, especially in the third mile, to work out the upper body as well. Leslie has Mary Kay leading through the entire second mile (miked this time! - Anyone who owns the 3-mile Walk Slim DVD will remember when Leslie had Mary Kay lead for two minutes with no microphone - this time we can HEAR her!). She does an excellent job - very energetic. No jogging (or ""boosted walking"" as Leslie likes to call it) in this routine but the pace is still very good and the second mile is a fast one. The DVD is divided into mile ""chapters"" so one could break up the walk into smaller chunks if necessary. The cuing is also much improved over the Walk Slim series - altogether an easy to follow workout that really works up a sweat!",1189209600,72,1106,4.4
2868767,5,B000RL21OA,"I own over 25 of Leslie's videos and I absolutely love this one! The set in the DVD that is used is the same one from the DVD that comes with her new book, ""Walking the Walk: Getting Fit with Faith"". It is an excellent workout. The 2nd mile that Mary Kay leads really got my heart rate up. The miles went quickly and I got a good workout. If you love Leslie's videos, then this is a must have for your collection!",1188864000,21,413,3.9879518072289155
2868768,5,B000RL21OA,"I own quite a few of Leslie's workouts and for me, this one has got to be, hands down, one of her very best. The set is beautiful - light, bright and airy, with frosted windows and plants in the background, hardwood floors and a few props like yoga mats, towels, etc. on shelves. To me, this is so much more visually appealing than the black curtain in the Walk Slim set or the concrete floor and empty industrial look of the Express set. Leslie leads miles one and three, while MaryKay leads mile two (and she has a microphone this time around, so you can hear her!). They are joined by four other walkers: Barb & Stephanie from the Walk Slim series and newcomers Vance & Suzette. Leslie incorporates the use of light handweights at the end of mile one and throughout most of mile three. No weights are used during mile two, which is pretty fast paced (but which does not use any of her boosted walking). Two songs with vocals from the Walk Slim series are re-used here, but the rest of the music was new to me. The cueing by both Leslie and MaryKay is spot on - absolutely no mistakes from either of them. They are friendly and happy, but professional (I love Leslie's workouts, but sometimes she gets a little over-excited - there is none of that here). There is nothing about this workout that I would criticize and I can see myself getting a lot of use out of it.",1188864000,210,1368,4.326848249027237

2868794,5,B000RL21OA,"I prefer the older DVD's of Leslie's as opposed to the newer ones.  I like how one of the miles is led by Mary Kay for a change and light soft hand weights are used in some of the workout.  Plus, a lot of the walkers look ""realistic"".  They don't have perfect bodies but yet are keeping up with Leslie the entire time.  It's a shame this is a 3-mile workout as I mainly only have time for her 1 and 2 mile workouts during my busy workweek, but I do have time for this one every now and then.  I wish Leslie would release more like this one.",1455148800,2,540,3.9174311926605503

2868804,5,B000RL21OA,I really like this one.  I enjoy the pace and the use of hand weights.  The set is bright and cheerful. Ms. Sansone does another excellent workout.,1442361600,,147,4.407407407407407
2868805,3,B000RL21OA,"I'm new to Leslie Sansone - I bought this one (3 Mile Weight Loss Walk), Walk Your Belly Flat, and the new Miracle Miles 5 DVD set (only available through her website at this time). This week has been spent with 3 Mile Weight Loss. I rate this as ""It's okay."" I would have liked it had there been less monologuing.

This is a decent  workout for a beginner, which is what I am. The moves are really basic: kicks, side-steps, knee lifts, kick-backs; with some clapping and arm lifts, and minimal hand weights (optional) under Leslie's direction. If mileage is important to you, be warned that this is not really 3 miles. One third of the first 'mile' includes the warmup. Likewise, the 3rd 'mile' contains a cooldown. Had those segments been done at the regular walking pace, they would have been full miles... but they aren't. The second mile is led by Mary Kay, and is faster paced and has more challenging moves (slight variation to basic moves and/or longer duration). You are encouraged -- and I mean REALLY, genuinely, encouraged -- to just walk, or to keep your arms low, if you become fatigued or if the moves are too much for you (as long as you keep moving). I thought that was a very nice touch as I came away feeling good about myself, even though I couldn't keep up with the moves during the 2nd mile.

PROS: even beginners can do this video; the instructors (Leslie and Mary Kay) seem genuine and encouraging; you walk away feeling good about yourself, regardless of your ability to keep up.

CONS: Leslie's chatty nature and tendency to monologue may reduce the replay value of this video for some people (like me); there is no guidance for the 'kick' move, so if you enthusiastically throw your foot forward to achieve the kick motion (like me), you could over extend your knee and cause an injury.",1441670400,,1813,4.552147239263804
2868806,5,B000RL21OA,All of Leslie Sansone tapes are great.  This is a great starter tape for anyone.,1441411200,,80,4.333333333333333
2868807,4,B000RL21OA,"I love Leslie, but I don't care for Mary Kay she seems phony to me. I don't do this workout as often because of her and I won't purchase any with her featured. All in all its a great workout.",1441411200,,191,3.8

2868810,5,B000RL21OA,"Fun and energetic, like her other walking videos. This has become my favorite because the 2nd mile seems quicker paced than some other videos, she has someone else lead that 2nd mile for variation, and I really enjoy the music. I normally use Leslie Sansone videos during the winter months; but I decided to try it after purchasing early summer, and I've used it every week since. It's a lot of fun!",1440460800,,399,4.555555555555555

2868813,4,B000RL21OA,"I like using Leslie's ""Walk Away the Pounds"" videos for days when I'm not feeling up to intense workouts. When I'm looking for a WATP workout on the more intense side but not quite up to TurboFire level, this 3 Mile Weight Loss Walk is a good choice.

Pros: It is broken down into 3 segments. Segments 1 and 3 are with Leslie leading, and use hand weights in parts of it for some light arm strength training -- a very nice addition. The middle segment is a speed walk without the hand weights that's led by Mary Kay, a guest for this video. I find this part of the workout the best aerobically, because the speed really has you moving. It's about 51 minutes long with the warm-up and cool-down, and I find that I get a decent workout by the time I'm done.

Cons: The music in this video is, at times, too loud at times, and seems to overpower her voice which is giving the movement directions. The music also isn't always in sync with the workout, so there will be times when the music stops to change tempo, and she's just talking and telling you to keep moving until the next beat comes up. The segment with Mary Kay leading is actually kind of annoying -- just something about her voice and personality just doesn't click with being an aerobics leader; I am not sure I would have bought this had I known Leslie was not leading all of the video. Even so, the video is still worth it.",1438128000,2,1385,4.262357414448669

2868828,5,B000RL21OA,"I just started Leslie's Walk at Home program last month.  I started out with a beginner DVD with a couple 1 mile walks and some 2 mile walks.  I was amazed at how quickly I felt ready to tackle a longer walk.  I chose this one, The 3 mile weight loss walk and LOVE it!  It is my favorite so far.  I like that the music is very upbeat and I feel like I get a very good workout.  I did purchase 2 lb. weights to use as she uses them a little in mile 1 and then through mile 3.  Leslie leads miles 1 and 3.  Mary Kay leads mile 2 for a speed walking power walk and I feel that I get a super good workout with her.  I like the other walkers as several are success stories and it shows how much weight they have lost with her walk program. I recommend this DVD even if you are new to the program as it is more challenging than the 1 and 2 mile yet is it not too hard.  There is no boosted walking and just uses the basic steps.  You can use the walk with our without the weights ( a couple of the walkers do not use them)",1424304000,2,1016,3.723004694835681

2868841,5,B000RL21OA,I think this is my favourite Leslie Sansone DVD and that is because of the music and her walkers in the gym. They are such real people and they display a variety of body shapes. I can really identify with this group. The workout is challenging if you stay with the leader and Leslie's frequent reminders to tighten the core helps me to keep my posture tall and straight. I really enjoy all 7 of my Sansone DVD's. They are all slightly different but they all feature the four basic steps of her walking routine. I am glad I found these DVD's.,1417305600,3,541,4.313725490196078

The 12 minute 2nd mile really gets you going.  Some days I use hand weights, some days I don't but I feel like I'm getting a great workout either way.  I have the Radio Remixes 3 mile walk and I hardly work up a sweat doing that workout.  I've been doing this workout for 2 weeks and at the end of the session, my legs still feel wobbly and I really feel like I've burned some calories and accomplished something.  The set is really attractive and I like the fact that the walkers are not all model thin.  During the walk a headline pops up by three of the walkers telling you how much weight they have lost with walking and that's really motivating.  If they can lose that much just walking, then so can I!  Absolutely love this workout - my favorite!",1405382400,10,917,4.129943502824859

I would love to see more workouts like this, with more miles filled with the fast-paced energy of the second mile. I've been doing these workouts for three years, and they tone my body all over, make me feel happy, and really help to relieve stress.

2868878,5,B000RL21OA,"I realized that I needed to get my heartrate up, but found that I was out of shape even though I stand on my feet 8 hrs a day. I found that the gym experience focused on strength training but lacked aerobic exercise. I needed something that fit in my schedule so Home Exercise was the only option. I shopped on You Tube before I bought anything. My 80 yr old mom does what she can because it's mostly walking in place. You don't need a lot of room either. I really like that they mark off each 1 mile past, so you can work up to the 3 mile workout. Vance was the biggest inspiration for me. If he could do the exercise with his size, I felt that I could too. Leslie gives you clear instructions of what's coming next.

2868916,5,B000RL21OA,"This is my second 'Leslie' review and my first gives a bit of background about why I'm so delighted to have found her eg I'm English, she isn't so well known/widely available here, we're very limited on choice because we can't play region 1 dvds notwithstanding the fact the ones we can get are considerably more expensive.  That said, she's still worth every penny, believe me!!

I now own about a dozen and this one is a very firm favourite of mine.  In the short time I've been walking with Leslie <since February of this year>, I've learned to ramp up the sessions with the use of ankle/hand weights and use favourite steps from all of them when I feel I need to.  If you don't feel you're getting quite enough of what you want, just improvise and make it harder for yourself.  I am not overweight <anymore!!>, so I need to work harder in order to achieve a really satisfying workout that burns my 'Maintenance' calories and has me sweating.

What I love about her workouts is that she's opened my eyes to the fact I really don't need to attempt to launch myself into orbit, grovel around on the floor trying to get into painful and virtually impossible contortions, risk injury, bust my knees or bore myself silly in the process!  I don't dread my exercise sessions with her.  I also now walk my dog with considerably more enthusiasm and my hrm confirms the fact I really am using up some serious energy all round.  I generally feel much fitter, stronger and have more stamina.  I always used to think of exercise as 'No pain, no gain' but I now know differently and it's been such a revelation.

I particularly like this one as it's fast paced and has some different and very motivating music.  It probably isn't, but I 'Feel' as though it's the toughest of all the ones I have. I like Leslie's enthusiasm, cheerfulness and constant chatter throughout. It is so much more like a chat with a friend than the eternal 'Good job' you get from so many instructors.  I also like seeing the other 'Walkers' and hearing their success stories.  Mary Kay's mile is fantastic and probably the most sweat inducing mile I've ever done - I also like Leslie's gentle larking around in the background.  It's all very visual, creates diversions and the miles are done before you know it.  If I have any slight issue with this dvd it would be that the third mile starts slowing down a bit too soon.  Come on, it's only a three miler after all and so we need to get the biggest 'Burn' for the longest time out of it.  That said, you can always go back and 'Walk' an extra fast mile before going on to the finale.  I always do my own extra stretches at the end, too.

As you may gather, I'm extremely pleased to have found Leslie.  She has changed the way I think about exercise, relieved me of my former dread of it and generally got me up and moving a lot more.  It doesn't have to be a chore, a bore or something that fills me with trepidation just getting ready for the onslaught nor leaves me feeling half dead at the end of it.  I only stumbled across her by 'Accident' whilst searching reviews on here.  My only regret - I didn't find her sooner!!",1370649600,2,3140,4.392733564013841

I went from a size 16 Plus Size  to a size 10PT. I really enjoy doing the walking exercises to my Gospel Music. With the help of my Lord through prayer and also using  The 3 Mile Weight Loss Walk DVD , I was able to lower my blood pressure and also lower my blood sugar and now I am to keep the conditons in the healthy range.

2868925,5,B000RL21OA,"I have only been doing Leslie workouts for a few months, and I have become addicted.  I bought a few, but to give myself some variety, I have also been borrowing some from the library to see what other ones I might want to purchase.  I am not a fan of some of her older ones that I've gotten, but after borrowing this one, I think it may be the next one I purchase.  I really like the group of walkers (I like when they are of varying body types and this even tells you how much weight some of them have lost doing the walks).  I like the brighter sets like this rather than the ones with the big black curtain behind.  It just gives it more of a good feel for me personally.  The music is good, and the workout is one of the toughest 3 miles in my opinion.  They incorporate weights a few times (optional of course, and I don't think they are included with the dvd, but as I borrowed it from the library, I'm not certain).  Mary Kay does the whole second mile.  I have only seen her do a few minutes here and there in others so far.  Man, she gets the abs working with all the knee lifts, but you feel so good after it's done.  I was sweating like crazy, and I really felt like I had accomplished something when I finished this.  You can even get a good workout just doing 1 or 2 of the miles if you don't want to do all 3.  I only did 2 the first time, and still felt very good and accomplished.",1337212800,,1397,3.96415770609319
2868926,5,B000RL21OA,As with all my Leslie Sansone videos - be prepared for a good workout. I love the low impact high calorie burn you get with her videos. And I love how she reminds me to check my posture. I am even checking my posture throughout the day now.,1334707200,,240,4.020833333333333

2868929,5,B000RL21OA,I own several of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds DVD's.  Even though I haven't seen all of them I would say that this is one of her best.  On her older videos I would have to turn down the sound because the music was so mundane and boring.  But the music in this is much better.  I like that she slowly builds the heart rate and doesnt go right into an over exerting workout. Also having Mary lead the workout on mile 2 was a nice change of pace and keeps things interesting and you get a full body workout with hand weights. I am overweight and this is a nice workout because you don't have to be coordinated or super skinny to keep up.  I will definitely be buying more Walk Away the Pounds in the future.,1324080000,,713,4.100719424460432
2868930,3,B000RL21OA,"I used to think that the reason that Leslie talks so much is because she wants to keep the walkers from getting bored since the moves are pretty much the same throughout each workout.

Now, I know I was wrong. I just think she is egotistical (because I don't want to use the other popular term). What other reason would you give the reins to your sister to lead one of the miles yet continually talk over her, joke and play around with the other walkers (who are trying to pay attention), and try every way you can think to make sure that although someone else is the leader, the attention is still on you?

I actually uttered the words, ""Leslie Sansone is crazy"" while I was doing the routine. I was honestly taken aback by her behavior while Mary Kay was leading the 2nd mile. I found it not only distracting but rude and boorish.

I just wanted to get that out of the way.

On to the music: there were two songs that I'd never heard before but the rest were repeats. Whomever the music director was failed horribly at keeping the music continuous throughout however. There were several music-less moments accented only by the sound of the footsteps of the walkers.

Wardrobe: I've never commented on the wardrobe of the walkers but I'm going to in this review. It's been pointed out how Mary Kay has put on a significant amount of weight over the years. It is what it is. However, I wish that whomever was in charge of the wardrobe had taken her size into consideration when they were outfitting the walkers. The top that Mary Kay is wearing is plainly and simply too small. Early in the video, you can see the outline of her navel (the hole) through her shirt. There's also another walker in all black that is in front of the gentleman (Vance)who has on a top that looks like it's hot (in the Texas in summer sense).

Workout: There is about 45 minutes of movement and for most people that is good enough to get some type of workout. I wouldn't call this 3 full miles because the last mile is slower placed but is finished in a shorter span of time than the 2nd brisk mile. Veteran exercisers will probably find this a little slow while the newbies may feel this is a good jumpstart to a regular exercise program. I'd rather give this a 2.5 but since I can't, I rounded up.",1314144000,11,2277,4.3584905660377355
2868931,5,B000RL21OA,"I own four of Leslie's videos, but I have only used two so far -- both 3 mile walks.  The 3 mile fast walk is nice.  I like the group of individuals in the video and I think it's cute that Leslie has her daughter (and niece) working out as well.  The music is pretty good and, for me, someone who walks 5 miles outside at a pretty good pace, I like it.  However, it can be a little ""slow"" and it doesn't kick into gear until you're at mile 2.  HOWEVER, this video has you going from the get go.  There isn't much lag time between exercises and there's not a lot of explanation.  In addition, the addition of the weights (which I wish was used throughout, but I can understand why they are not) makes this a very good workout for those of us who live in cities where it gets 100 plus degrees in the summer and the humidity is dreadful and makes it unsafe to be walking in such high heat.  At least I don't want to be out in that type of weather.

The workout worked up a good sweat and I felt VERY satisfied.  Even though I was walking in my home, I felt like I was getting a good work.  I am also working out using a kettle bell program, so between walking 7 days a week and the kettle bell workout 3 of those days as well as pilates, I think this will be just what I will need to shed about 10 pounds before an upcoming trip.  Will keep you posted.

I highly recommend this video.",1310860800,,1381,3.978181818181818
2868932,3,B000RL21OA,"I swear by Leslie Sansone's walking programs. Over the years I have been collecting the ones that interest me most, so I was looking forward to trying this 3 Mile Weight Loss Walk dvd for the first time. I'm disappointed that there are an even number of pros and cons.

Pros:
1.) The dvd menu is split into segments, so that you can pick doing Mile One, Two, or Three, just the end stretching, or the entire program from start to finish.
2.) Three of the workout's participants are success stories, having lost 70 - 100lbs. each, with the help of walking workouts. People who are meeting their fitness goals are just really inspiring, especially if you are like me and have a lot of weight to walk off.
3.) The program has the option of using 1lb. - 2lb. handweights, which are used in miles One and Three. If you are like me and you really like Leslie's programs with weights, this one will appeal to you. Some of the weighted motions vary from motions in previous DVDs so there is some variety. If you are already familiar with using handweights with Leslie's walking programs, that knowledge will come in handy because you may have to modify some things to suit your own abilities.
4.) The music is fun and energizing compared to some previous Walk At Home DVDs I have tried thus far. The set is open and bright, and there are only a few walkers which is a nice break from past programs which had 10+ walkers and was too crowded.
5.) Mile Two is led by Mary Kay, who is a fun, focused and energetic instructor. She really pushes you to break a sweat and challenge yourself. Mile Two is my favorite (did I mention she is FOCUSED?), with one exception....

Cons:
1.) Leslie chatters over Mary Kay's instructions which is hugely distracting and annoying. She talks over Mary Kay's cues and instructions, giggles and talks to the other walkers while everyone - including the viewer - is just trying to do what they're there to do, and that is to get a good workout. I ended up wishing that Mary Kay just instructed the whole program, and that Leslie was either not talking or wasn't there. Which is too bad.
2.) Leslie's cues, when she gives them, are lacking. Earlier DVDs offer good cues, with a countdown and explanation before the next step. Be prepared to lose your footing and, if you're lucky, trip over your feet a few times. I recommend allowing yourself some leeway when it comes to easing into a new set of motions and don't worry about not catching the first one right in sync with the walkers on the DVD.
3.) I found the weighted motions in Mile Three - which require keeping a very stable core - to be too fast, too few reps and too poorly cued to be effective or safe.
4.) The upper body portion of the post-workout stretch is short and basic. After a 45 minute full-body walk, more thorough stretching is a must. I end up replaying the stretch part, from the DVD main menu to get a better stretch session and cooldown.
5.) There are gaps in the music rather than a smooth flow from one beat into a faster/slower beat, so if you rely on the music to keep your footsteps in rhythm be prepared to just stay on track by watching their feet.

As you can see from this review, I have mixed feelings about this particular program. It is one of the few 3-mile DVDs in her series which made me break a sweat so I hate to give it up for the simple fact that I wish the main menu also had a ""mute Leslie"" option. Maybe I'll get used to it if I try to ignore it? or stick my fingers in my ears and go ""LALALALALALLALALA"" whenever she gets going about Sisters In Sweat. But then I'd have to put the handweights down and break my stride.",1292544000,7,3638,4.347058823529411

Nice, straight forward workout, especially if you're using a weighted vest for added resistance.  Leslie speaks constantly throughout the entire thing, so you're never bored.

Having said that, however, I cannot say that this tape is without merit.

First of all, I really liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-3-Mile-Weight-Loss-Walk/dp/B000RL21OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: 3 Mile Weight Loss Walk</a>&nbsp;because it featured ""real"" people:individuals who were still noticeably overweight but were doing their best to lose that weight and had already made remarkable progress walking off their excesses. It encouraged me that this tape chose to recognize these people and note the amount of pounds that they had actually lost. Second, it pleased me that Leslie allowed one of her students (Mary Kay) to lead the second mile at the speed walking pace of a 12 minute mile. That was really energizing!  I did break into a sweat and felt really pumped up!  Third, it was wonderful that Leslie used hand weights in both the first and third mile. Finally, I really liked the music, especially the second mile as it was reminiscent of one of my favorite songs in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-s-Walk-Slim-4-Fast-Miles-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000OYCMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles  (2-Disc Set)</a>.

I guess the only reason I would not give this DVD a five-star is that it did not include the ""boosted walking"" I have come to love in several of Leslie's other tapes. I participate in 5K races as a walk-runner and the ""boosted walking"" jogging helps get me pumped up to go faster. If that had been included, I think I would have certainly give this DVD a five star! Other than that, I can honestly recommend it for a good three mile workout.",1284595200,5,3132,7.659279778393352

2868944,5,B000RL21OA,"I'm an avid walker (4-8 miles per day) but live in the northeast so winter months can be a real challenge. My daughter stumbled upon Leslie's DVDs when we were searching for something to get us through the season. Since we work out at 5 a.m., some dance workouts are too complicated when you're half asleep & we don't want to be yelled at (think Billy Blanks) so Leslie's routines work like a charm. She's not overly perky & the basic moves are easy enough to do when you're bleary-eyed. You get a good workout, with the weights & the fast pace, so you will work up a sweat. We use the 5 day fit walk (includes: 1 mile, 2 mile high calorie burn, 30 min. walk, walk & kick and power mile), the 5 mile fat burning walk, & the 3 mile weight loss in all kinds of combinations so we're never bored. For someone who loves to walk outside (& hates walking on a treadmill), this is a great alternative. For someone just starting to get into ANY kind of exercise, it's perfect because you can tailor it to your physical abilities. I really like the weight routines as well...very easy to include into a regular workout schedule.",1265155200,3,1119,4.333333333333333
2868945,4,B000RL21OA,"For some reason I really enjoy this dvd even though the workout really could be better.
The best thing about the ""3 Mile Weight Loss Walk"" is the fast-paced second mile led by Mary Kay. Unfortunately, her mile is sandwiched in-between Leslie's rather slow first and third miles.
FYI: There is no ""boosted walking"" (Leslie's term for jogging) on this walk.

High points:
* Mary Kay's mile. She ups the pace and brings fun and energy. Her cueing is excellent. She moves with more intensity than Leslie - inspiring me to do the same. I'm never quite ready for Leslie to take back the lead on this walk.
* The set. Although smaller, it is much lighter and brighter (i.e., cheerful and energizing) than the black curtained studio from the Walk Slim series.
(With that said, I LOVE ""Walk Slim 4 Fast Miles"" and highly recommend it in spite of the dark and heavy set.)
* I like the new walkers Vance and Suzette. Vance is a little like Eeyore and I find myself cheering him on. Smile, Vance, smile (he never does but he's probably just shy).

Low points:
* Leslie can't zip her lip and just let Mary Kay lead. I know she is being super generous to even allow one of her walkers to take the lead but, c'mon Leslie, if you're quiet for a minute I promise we won't forget that in-home walking is your baby!
* As stated above, slow first and third miles. Not much time to get the heart-rate up.

All in all, I'm glad I have this in my rotation. I'd say this workout is good for a beginner, a light day or as an add-on to another workout.",1264204800,3,1526,4.310104529616725

This dvd DOES make you work for results, but with ""markers"" at each mile, you can do it all, do one mile, or combine them. When I was rebuilding my stamina, I could only do the 1st mile. Soon after, I went on to do Mile 1, then skip to Mile 2 (the cool-down mile). Now, I some days do all 3 miles and include hand weights for the toning segments. And I even look forward to my ""Leslie workouts"" after a day at the office.

2868973,5,B000RL21OA,"I decided to try Leslie's ""Walk at Home"" dvds after developing knee problems.  I'm 38 and moderately overweight.  I have previously been a gym rat and was doubtful that I could get in shape (again) by ""only"" walking at home, but I was very pleasantly surprised!  The walking speed is fast and the workout is high energy throughout.  I can do the entire workout at high intensisty without my knees holding me back, whereas taebo and the biggest loser cardio workout were too much - I had to skip too many steps bc of my knees.

I have grown a library of Leslie's Walk at Home dvds and trade them out to avoid boredom.  I like Leslie's sunny disposition and encouragement and the miles go by quickly.  I highly recommend her dvds for beginner and returning exercisers.  They are a good, heart pumping and sweat inducing cardio workout that can be done at home.  I add some strength moves and situps afterward to roundout my routine.",1237939200,2,930,4.554216867469879

There were many snowy and rainy & cold days.  My husband and I are both in our 70s and love to get out and walk as our main source of daily exercise, usually walking 3-4 miles a day in good weather.  I love the friendly fun routines that never are boring, and never too hard for us, giving us the cardio workout and strength and balance training we both need.  We usually work out 45 minutes 6 days a week, and Leslie & her group are a great inspiration.  I can certainly recommend this DVD for daily exercise.  We have several other DVDs that Leslie has on the market; most of them are better suited to younger walkers.",1237507200,2,794,4.090322580645161

I especially liked the second mile lead out by Mary Kay, boy is she energetic! She did an excellent job! There are two walkers that lost 100lbs each and one lost 75 and is still loosing. They were a great bunch and really encouraging. I also liked Leslie's encouraging lines now and again. I only do two miles for now as I just started doing exercise again. As another reviewer stated, the setting is nice and bright and makes you want to be there. Oh, the video is intermediate level. My goal is not weight lose, just to get and stay in shape but I am sure it is good for weight loss too as her other dvds. Get it, you won't be disappointed!",1236902400,2,790,4.136363636363637

2868978,4,B000RL21OA,"I like this video, the only thing I did not like was Leslie talking and joking so much. I thought it was rude when Mary Kate was teaching and all Leslie was doing was trying to have conversations with everyone,other wise the workout is great.",1235174400,,242,4.4
2868979,5,B000RL21OA,Wow! This DVD has gotten me through this horrible winter without being a couch potato.  It is fun and worth the energy to go from start to finish!

2868981,5,B000RL21OA,"I never thought I'd ever use any of Leslie's workouts as I always thought they were more for the 'couch potatoes' who want to move just a little bit. Boy, was I wrong! I had no idea that the 'walking' can actually really get my heart rate up and burn quite a lot of calories! (I'm slim and don't need to lose any weight but I like to exercise for fitness & health.) I was astonished to see that the amount is somewhat around the same numbers that I burn when doing Turbo Jam for example!
Another real benefit of using Leslie's workouts: You'll trim your midsection! As fit as I am, but doing abs was never something for me really, which is why my stomach never got 100% firm again after having had my 2 kids... Now after having used the '3 mile weight loss' DVD as well as the 'Slim 4 fast & firm miles' for ~ 2 weeks, I can honestly say, my belly is as firm and flat as pre-kids! Wow! I never expected that to happen from a 'walking' workout!

I'm a new 'believer' when it comes to Leslie's workouts and the '3 mile weight loss' is a great one to have! I love this one! The set is beautiful & friendly, the crew very likable and Leslie's just fun! In the 2nd mile Mary Kay leads and it's quite tough!

If you'd like to try one of those walking workouts and aren't quite sure which one to get, get THIS one! Even if you can only do 1 or 2 miles in the beginning, you won't regret having this DVD and most likely it'll make you want more! (I know, it did for me! LOL)",1232236800,4,1466,4.034364261168385
2868982,2,B000RL21OA,"I own about 15 of Leslie's workouts, and this one is my least favorite for several reasons.  It is not challenging; I barely work up a sweat.  The music is not well organized, and there are always gaps of silence between songs.  But, what bothers me more than anything is that Mary Kay appears to have gained about 50 pounds since the last video.  I cannot seem to focus on anything in this tape other than her obesity.  Seeing her makes me realize that this exercise program is not effective for everyone.  Mary Kay teaches this program, yet she has gained a substantial amount of weight.  Seeing her in this video has prompted me to search for new workout programs.  Furthermore, Leslie cannot stand to simply walk and allow Mary Kay to lead the second mile.  She is constantly doing things behind Mary Kay's back to draw attention to herself.  It's very annoying.  Finally, poor Mary Kay is dressed in drab gray and black.  They could not have made her look worse if they have tried.",1231200000,8,986,4.5397727272727275
2868983,5,B000RL21OA,"I am a big Leslie Sansone fan. Our group uses her tapes religiously. Her workouts are safe and effective. Some complain that the moves are too repetitive and boring, but we have to remember that this is indoor walking aerobics. Even when walking outside, you are doing the same motion over and over, taking one step at a time. Leslie does incorporate various items such as the elactic band, the walk-away belt and small hand weights. I would say in her over 25 years of being a fitness expert, she has done a wonderful job in teaching us how to give our bodies a good workout from head to toe. This video will not disappoint and in the second mile, Mary Kay takes over and adds some variety.",1229904000,,691,4.40625

2868985,5,B000RL21OA,"I have been walking with Leslie for years and this workout is by far my favorite. It is challenging but doable, it gets my heart rate up, and it never gets boring. Having Mary Kay lead the second mile adds just enough of a twist to keep things interesting. I am a large person but not a beginner, so I need a workout that is difficult enough to make me sweat but that is not overly choreographed or requiring a lot of coordination or flexibility. This is the perfect level for me. I also enjoy seeing large people doing this workout along with Leslie and the gang. Seeing that they sometimes struggle a bit helps me to keep on going. I can't say enough about Leslie Sansone!!!",1229731200,2,676,4.330708661417323

It's harder for me to stick with a workout for weight loss when all the ppl on the dvd are sticks & don't need to lose weight anyway. That's not the case with this vid!  I highly recommend it! The 3 miles goes by very quickly & your heart rate is def up there! I was actually expecting a very easy walk in place vid & what I got was an awesome workout instead!,1227916800,2,512,3.876190476190476

2868988,5,B000RL21OA,I love this dvd! I am not a morning person but for me this one is like my coffee to get me going ( I am not a coffe drinker.) I do 30 minutes of it then go on to a faster more intense dvd. This is great for the beginner because it starts you slow to get used to moving and then you get going on that second mile. This is definitely my favorite.,1219363200,,344,3.6

I used to have a treadmill, which helped me keep in shape, but had to give it up when I moved to a second-floor apartment with thin, squeaky floor. Then I was in a weight gain hell, until I stumbled onto this dvd. This dvd keeps me working out continuously (like a treadmill does), and I have actually lost weight in the last two months of this walking workout! And time literally flies when you're working out this dvd. At first the three miles were challenging enough, but since July, I have been walking four miles by doubling the middle mile (i.e. 1-2-2-3 instead of 1-2-3) and it is just a great workout.

This workout made me sweat but was not too hard. And, I loved the fact that several of the other walkers were ""real"" people who had lost weight by walking away the pounds. I am encouraged to move up to the four and five mile DVD's. It is an easy way to get fit.",1218931200,2,439,3.888888888888889

I especially love that Mary Kaye does the fast 2nd mile walk and you really get a real workout. Shes fast, fun, and right on target. I usually don't sweat, but this DVD did the trick!  It was a nice change to have Leslie utilize one of her Walkers to do a mile, just so that we can see how her other walking instructors teach. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good workout, but doesn't want the feeling of being exhausted while doing it.  I think you will reach for it more than once!!",1218844800,,583,4.008620689655173
2868992,5,B000RL21OA,"Every positive review of this dvd is TRUE!

My little add on is:
You know how it's kind of hard to do a workout dvd with ONLY the leader doing all the smiling and having fun while those in the back ground with either a stone face or a fake plastered on smile?  Your legs start feeling like lead, you start wishing you were done, etc.
Well, NOT this video!  The people in the background look SO genuiinely happy and cheerful!(All except for the one man and a lady on the side - but she tried.) They actually look like they ENJOY all that excercise and their experience truly resonates and translates into mine.

I think Leslie is at her best, too.  She is playful but also very encouraging.  My favorite lines ""You don't have to settle for a slow matobolism -NO WAY!""  and ""Don't let muscle waste away"".  Then at the end she reinforces her positive thoughts by softly saying ""you are a healthy person"" and ""you have a healthy body"".  VERY good for mental reprogramming any negative thought patterns.
In short:

I LOVE THIS DVD!",1218326400,7,1026,4.438502673796791
2868993,5,B000RL21OA,"The most important thing to remember with any of Leslie's DVDs is that you do NOT have to do the arm movements or use the weights when you are beginning. I believe this is an excellent way for sedentary people to get active again. You can gradually increase your movement by adding the arm movements as you get more fit. Ultimately, add the weights. I love the third mile that uses lots of weights movements for the arms. I have added it to other miles from Leslie's other DVDs to form my own custom workout.

I literally thank God every single day for bringing Leslie's DVDs and the Wii Fit program into my life.",1218240000,4,613,4.37719298245614

This DVD is one of my favorite Leslie DVDs and I can get through the first two miles with no problem.  However, I wish there were an actual cool-down segment instead of just the quick stretch at the end.  After working through two miles, I have to cool myself down before doing the stretch at the end.  The set is nice and the exercisers are motivating - two of them lost 100 pounds and one lost 70 pounds.  A nice incentive!",1215734400,3,588,4.205357142857143

I like how this DVD is split up on the menu so you could do just a 1 or 2 mile and go directly to the stretch.  Good energy and a few new moves.  It was over before I knew it!  I love working with the weights and the weights portion was at a bit slower pace than some of her DVDs but it seems to be just as effective as moving quickly with the weights.  I enjoyed all the miles.  I will use this one a lot.  I also have her WATP 1-2-3 miles in one DVD which is also very fun as well as some others including Walk Strong 3 Mile (with weights...also a good one!). There were not as many side steps in this one which I like as I have a foot issue that bothers me sometimes with so many side steps. I actually look forward to doing this DVD.  That is saying a lot.  Since January I have lost 15 pounds with doing Leslie's workouts (not every day, either)  I started with the one mile and have dropped two sizes so far.  I like the 45 minute workout.  It's the most I seem to be able to fit into my schedule. I recommend this DVD.  It can be more or less intense depending on how you feel that day.  Very flexible.",1213833600,,1265,3.921259842519685

She said this video really mixes it up, throws in a few different moves and the music is louder. She was right, I love this DVD workout. The second mile seems long and your heart rate gets right up there, and I like that Mary Kate gets to lead, it is a nice change.  I also downloaded the .mp3 music files for Leslie's 3 mile workout that is designed to be used with a treadmill or on your own. I turn the sound down on WATP/Express and play the music instead and its like a new workout (and I'm more motivated).  Overall, this is a terrific video.",1212019200,2,782,4.071428571428571

Mary Kay doesn't have Leslie exuberant personality but she's a solid leader (and she doesn't have Leslie's disconcerting tendency to start moves on the upbeat, or on no particular beat at all).

Combining the weights just adds to the intensity.  I have lost 70 pounds using her workouts (and of course watching my food intake).  When people ask me how I have done it I always tell them walking at home with my walking videos.  A lot of them don't belive that I could have such good results with the videos but if you are commited they work.

2869009,5,B000RL21OA,"This tape is a great way to exercise for those of us who tend to be lazy and full of excuses. You just pop it into your DVD and start moving in front of the TV. You can do it in your pajamas and it doesn't matter if you haven't showered or washed your hair yet. There's no one else watching or judging you.

The 3-mile walk takes 45 minutes, but you can do any portion of it that you want--one mile or two or all three. The middle section is quite brisk and you'll definitely sweat. You'll burn more calories than by taking a regular walk outside. (Some of the people on the tape have lost up to 100 lb on the program!) There are other moves besides plain walking to keep it interesting, and the steps are easy to follow.

I've been using this tape for several months and I really think it's perfect for me. No expensive equipment to buy or driving to and from health clubs. It's been a great investment in my health for only $8 and I feel really proud of myself every time I finish a session. (P.S.

The first mile goes at a nice pace, and then the second mile really kicks it up into high gear!  It was challenging but not so difficult that I couldn't keep up.
My only criticism is that after doing such a brisk second mile, the pace of the third mile seems a bit slow so I just walked a little bit faster than Leslie was in the video.
I found the music cheesy but it has a good pace and will keep you going.  The background setting felt tranquil, like a yoga or pilates studio.

The 1st mile starts with warm up and then it gets faster and at the end of the 1 mile, a few minutes of exercise with weight.  The 2nd mile goes faster and the 3rd mile is weight exercise.  The music on this program is much better than the other ones, it has real songs so time goes by faster. The room is brighter than some other programs.

This program offers a little bit of everything: slow and fast aerobic, and weight training.  With the 3rd mile, some day I use 3pds and some other day I use 5pds depending on whether I am tired or not. At my age (I am 52 years old), this program works really well for me.",1206662400,,682,3.9562043795620436
2869018,5,B000RL21OA,"I am an advanced exerciser and have been doing workout tapes for 8 years.  I like walking tapes to give me a variety and it is nice and low-impact.
I already had 2 other Leslie Sansone walking DVDs, but they were a little older.  I liked that this one is new.  The music is way more modern, which made the workouts more tolerable (in my opinion).
I really thought this was a good workout, as it is split into 3 different miles.  The first mile is good, then you get to the 2nd mile and a different woman in her group leads. It is suprisingly fast and really gets your heartrate up.  I didn't expect to be walking so fast, but this was a good surprise!
The 3rd mile is much like the first in terms of pace.
You will feel like you got a work-out in, yet feel very energized afterwards.",1206403200,3,783,4.125
2869019,5,B000RL21OA,I own several Leslie Dvd's but this one is got to be among my top favorites.  Leslie and Mary lead you on a 3 mile energy walk with hand weights.  The 2nd mile is a boost from her other walks and you really move it.  You don't use the weights in this mile but you feel the sweat in this mile because of the pace.  This is very well done,1206403200,,336,3.757142857142857

In the end, you will have worked up a good sweat and feel energergized. I like Leslie as an instructor, although sometimes she can be annoying with chatter, causing me to lose focus and movements. This time she let Mary Kay lead the second mile and Mary Kay is a tough walk leader. I was actually happy when Leslie took over the reigns again. If you are a fan of the Leslie Walkers, I believe you will like this one.",1206230400,,525,4.106796116504855
2869021,5,B000RL21OA,"I have a lot of Leslie workouts and consider the 4 Mile Super Challenge Express to be her best, this is a close second.

The music is very energizing and for a change it's actually audible, though on my dvd, the 3rd mile seems to be at a much higher volume than the other 2 miles.  Mary Kay may have put a little weight on, but she can still whip your behind in mile 2! I like her energy.  I love Leslie, but I found it a little irritating that she interrupted a lot while Mary Kay was leading mile 2. The woman just can 't be quiet!  But having said that, I still find her very motivating and uplifting.  She's always smiling, always supportive and encouraging.  That's what you need to get you through a workout some days...and she provides it.

It wasn't very challenging, but I am a more advanced walker.  However, those just starting an exercise regimen might find this DVD to be a good fit for them. It has easy steps to follow, and good cues. It also has some free weight exercises for your upper body,  as you are walking.",1204502400,54,421,4.454545454545454

2869027,4,B000RL21OA,"I really enjoy this workout, but find the breakdown by ""miles"" a bit misleading.  The ""middle mile"" led by Mary Kay is a much faster pace than the first and third miles, but times out at the same or a little longer in length -- so does that make her mile longer than the other two miles?  Also the music is much louder when Mary Kay takes over, so for those of us who have to exercise with the volume turned way down low, it is hard to hear the cues.  And I have learned to tune out Mary Kay's bounciness - it's almost like a constant jog!  I just watch Leslie.  I love the weights used during Leslie's segment - I use 3# and it adds to the workout.  And tho a couple of times the cues are very last minute, most of the time I know when a different step will be occurring.  I am using this DVD twice a week, and really work up a good sweat by the end of it.  A very good workout!",1204416000,14,879,3.8715083798882683

I do a lot of outdoor walking in the nicer weather - up to seven miles a day, so I was really skeptical about how good of a walking workout I could get in my living room.  I was pleasantly surprised!!  It wasn't anything I couldn't keep up with, but I was definitely sweating by the start of the second mile. The third mile slows down a bit, but I found that because of using the weights, I was actually sweating even more!  In less than two months, I've gone from a size ten to a size eight.  I talked my mother into trying it because she wants to lose weight, and in just two weeks she's already lost five pounds!!!

I'm so happy with the endurance I've gained from doing this video that I'm seriously considering taking up jogging instead of walking when Spring rolls around.  Please don't be afraid to give this workout a try!",1204070400,11,932,4.231638418079096

2869038,5,B000RL21OA,"Whew! what a fantastic workout by Leslie! Another great one! Mile 1 and 3 sneak up on you in terms of working harder than you realized. The hand weights bump it up to be a great muscle/strength training workout. Mary Kay's 2nd mile is fast paced and fun!
On the ""down side"", if there is one. There are a few spots where the music doesn't cue up very fast so you have a short time of walking without music. It's not a big deal and doesn't affect your workout but doesn't seem as smooth as most of Leslie's workouts. The great workout more than offsets that minor thing!

This is a good workout for several levels of fitness. You can always ramp it up by putting more into it, but starts out slow enough that a beginner wouldn't be overwhelmed. 2 (sweaty) thumbs up!",1202342400,2,764,4.305555555555555

As a former power walker, 5 days a week, 3 miles/45 min., I have greatly missed my walks, until recently.  After almost 4 weeks of walking with Leslie, I am back to the great feeling of accomplishment that I'm doing something good for my body and mind.  I still have some pain, but walking in-place replaces the different elevations that caused a lot of the pain.  While walking with Leslie, I'm able to get a bit more exercise, by ""pumping up"" my upper body movements along with vigorous walking.
I will be enjoying this dvd for a long time to come.  After my eventual hip replacement surgery, I know I will be once again walking with Leslie and crew!
