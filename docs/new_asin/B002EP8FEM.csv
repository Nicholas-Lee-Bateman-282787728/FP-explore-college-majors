3918741,5,B002EP8FEM,"The film does a terrific job of examining Dalton Trumbo's unyielding beliefs, his
cantankerous personality, and most importantly his words.

His letters are read by terrific actors like David Straithairn and Donald Sutherland,
and it's in these readings that we get an insight into how sad and deep America's
fear of intellectuals and artists really is.

The film has flaws, including rushing through some of the most important turns in
Trumbo's professional life (e.g., his return to finally being able to take credit for his
work in 1960) and there's a slight lack of emotional punch to the whole thing.

But  this is intelligent filmmaking, and Trumbo's words will ring in my head for a long time.",1306627200,4,700,4.957264957264957
3918742,5,B002EP8FEM,"James Dalton Trumbo, a man for all seasons

What do you say about a man who stood his ground without reservation? A visionary who fell from grace, and found dignity to be different.

 In 1946 thru 1960 Trumbo weathered the assault of the United States Government, a Senator from Wisconsin Joseph R. McCarthy, and  hollywood's  disgrace. The House on Un-American Activities, et al,  imprisoned him for a year, and took away his only means to survive, writing.  The man who gave us, ""Johnny Got His Gun"" was deprived by a man without intellect or judgment to render such opinion(s).

Dalton son, Christopher directed the film. In my opinion made it real, without error, and that is what Trumbo demanded. This film will make you cry, and laugh, and a little of both.

You are Spartacus, James Dalton Trumbo,
""Barcelona fell, and you were not there, and I was not there, and perhaps if we had been, the city would have stood and the world would have been changed and better. But we were here, and here together we remain, and our city won't fall, and if it should, better that we lie buried in its ruins than be found absent a second time.""

3918743,3,B002EP8FEM,"Trumbo is both a biography of blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo and a set of readings from his letters. The film is a partial success. The man is fascinating, but his letters fail to hold the viewer's attention.

The film has some interesting moments. The excerpts from Trumbo's novels and screenplays make clear that he was talented. The story of the Trumbo family scraping out a living during the blacklist is fascinating. There are also many great photos of Trumbo, his family, and his friends.

Trumbo's letters take up too much of the film. Granted, he was a witty correspondent and some of the letters are brilliant. But I quickly started to lose interest. The actors' readings add little; the filmmakers could easily have used one anonymous narrator and gotten the same effect.

There is not enough about Trumbo's life story in the film. The viewer hears nothing of his early life or of his later years; the focus is on his time as a screenwriter. There are hints of alcoholism, profligate spending, and truculence, but the man never emerges. The most-frustrating aspect of the film is that it omits any discussion of Trumbo's true political views, which are at the heart of his life story.

Trumbo is not a bad movie, but I want to know more about him.",1264291200,17,1259,4.735159817351598
3918744,5,B002EP8FEM,"Dalton Trumbo was a leading screenwriter before his inclusion on HUAC's ""Black List"" brought his career to a standstill, and then drove him underground. However, as this documentary reveals, he was also a master letter-writer. During the years when he couldn't any longer openly write screenplays, he still wrote letters - beautiful, eloquent letters to friends and foes.

This documentary has some first-rate actors reminiscing about their acquaintanceship with Trumbo during those McCarthy-era years, and reading his letters. If you think sitting and listening to actors read letters would be boring - this DVD will change your mind. People such as Paul Giamatti bring Trumbo to life via these sometimes acerbic, sometimes affectionate, always literate letters.

The readings and reminisces are interspersed with footage of the HUAC hearings, showing the Hollywood celebrities who felt pressured to ""name names,"" and those who refused and suffered the consequences. There is also home movie footage and photographs providing snapshots of Trumbo's family through some of the good times and the bad. We see Trumbo as being above all a family-man, sustained through the years of Black List ostracism by these relationships. So at its core, this turns out to be an unexpected love story.

Whether the people who were blacklisted had entertained Communist sympathies or not - this film puts a personal face on the ordeal of being blacklisted for one's beliefs - or suspected beliefs.",1259625600,19,1480,5.343347639484978
3918745,5,B002EP8FEM,"Today, along with the DVD under review , ""Trumbo"", I have written a review of the film ""Revolutionary Road"", based on the 1950s novel by Richard Yates, about the `trials and tribulations' of an upwardly mobile white middle class suburban couple who are dissatisfied with that existence but can't break out.  ""Trumbo"", about the real trials and tribulations of a great American writer, Dalton Trumbo provides an interesting contrast from the same period of  history, post World War II America. The two are joined together in an odd way. The unstated subtext of ""Revolutionary Road"" is that it is not wise to challenge the cookie-cutter norm, nor is it `wise' to defy the ""security blanket"" provided by capitalist America in its fight against ""godless communism"". And for proof, just ask Dalton Trumbo, (or any of the ""Hollywood Ten"" writers and others who had to endure the 1950s (and beyond) blacklists.

This aspect of the Cold War, now mainly forgotten, is the apt subject here. One of the commentators let the cat out of the bag concerning the ""red scare"" and its victims. These victims of America's post-war build-up of the Cold War against the Soviet Union were men and women who, at heart, were liberals in the old-fashioned sense but who between the horrors of the Great Depression, the rise of fascism and their own basically decent human instincts gravitated toward communism, or at least what they took for communism as presented by the popular frontist American Communist Party. In the post-war period when America was determined to be hegemonic that boded ill for those who had been previously favorably disposed to the Soviet Union.

This one and one half hour goes into detail about all of that, including some very interesting black and white film from the period that somehow seems to capture the moment better than any 'talking head' commentary. More than that though this is a ""tribute"" to Dalton Trumbo's struggle against adversity when he, honorably, said no to the government. No. He would not be an informer. No. He would not stand for the abridgement of his right to free speech. He went to jail, had a hard time getting work later (in the period of the ""front"" which Woody Allen made a very clever film, ""The Front"" out of), and much later was vindicated in a way by being recognized for his writing achievements, including a number of screenplays that were outstanding like ""Spartacus"". All of this is told through Dalton Trumbo interviews giving during various periods of his life, the voices of various actors like Donald Sutherland and Michael Douglas performing excerpts from his works, and by remembrances of his children and other survivors from that period.

Two things to finish up. You MUST read, if you want a top grade anti-war novel, Trumbo's savage indictment of the effects of war on the young, ""Johnny Got His Gun"" that is excerpted in this presentation. And, although other that the novel just mentioned and some films (including ""Spartacus"" and ""the Exodus"") that I had seen and that Trumbo wrote the screenplays for I was not that familiar with his personal story aside from his political problems. After viewing this film I have one abiding thought about the man. Dalton Trumbo was too good human material to have labored, and I think thanklessly, for the by then distorted Stalinized American Communist Party. We, of the anti-Stalinist, anti-capitalist, pro-communist left could have used his finely- etched pen to better effect.",1258156800,4,3474,4.95197255574614
3918746,5,B002EP8FEM,"A sober reminder of the power of tryanny over the individual. An individual who will stands up, because he cannot stand down.
 Thus it becomes a matter of priciple for Dalton Trumbo and the other Hollywood writers to make that stand. All they has to do was to inform on friends. Those who had participated in the crime of speaking their own minds.
 I write this on Veteran's Day. A day many gave their lives so that others could speak freely, even if they themselves adamantly disagreed with there politics or religion. It was a matter of the American Spirit itself, forged in the crucible of war, where many died or were wounded just so that their sons & daughter could live ""free"". Trumbo and the others also took that symbolic stand. The Supreme Court, aka Supreme Denial, refused to hear their case when they were marched off to jail. Many subsequently committed suicide. It was economic warfare on the ten who dared speak against the power. Some crumbled. Those that survivived suffered divorces, poverty, and other degradations, as a consequence of not only talking American, but being American - not bending over to the tryanny, but standing up against the powerful for the principals upon which this country was founded.
 Ironicaly, the Supreme Court, aka Supreme Denial, in Buckley vs. Valeo in 1976 ruled that Free Speech is $$$$, thereby guaranteeing economic capital's purchase of the peoples' political capital. Corporations, with remorseless impunity, could corrupt the peoples' elections, strangling anychance of meaningful representation of the poor/middle classes.
 This documentary has Kirk Douglas, his son Michael, Donald Sutherland, Liam Neeson, and others reading the letters of those writers and Trumble. That is worth the price of admission alone. The archived films and portrayal of the times are very informative.
 The film and its themes are timeless.

  The struggle of people against power
  Is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!

P.S. The Red Scare sweeping the U.S., the rise of Red-Hunter General Senator Joe McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover's Messianic persecutions, the House of Un-American Activities Committee and the Hollywood purge was an ironic reflection of look-alike Soviet pogroms and show trials.",1257897600,14,2267,5.214876033057851
3918747,5,B002EP8FEM,"Christopher Trumbo wrote a play about his father, novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, and it has been produced both on Broadway and by regional theater companies over the last 10 years. The story behind the elder Trumbo's blacklisting during the communist ""witch hunts"" in the 1950s is important and needed wider exposure. This film, which played briefly in theaters, is, thankfully now on home video. It is essential viewing for every high school student to show what can happen when people act, rather than think. And it shows how, for a period in the 1950s the words ""freedom"" and ""fair trial"" were not as common in the US as the Constitution says they should be.

Direct Peter Askin used the younger Trumbo's script as a jumping off point but opened up the story through creative use of archival film interviews with the screenwriter combined with well known actors (Nathan Lane, Donald Sutherland, Michael Douglas - whose father Kirk starred in ""Spartacus"", one of Trumbo's efforts and appears here briefly- and  Joan Allen among others)  reciting Trumbo's own letters to friends and colleagues. These letters are often quite long and are, in effect, short stories. The performances by the actors are truly stunning! We see brief excerpts for films that Trumbo scripted (whether he was given credit or not on the screen) to show how his values were reflected in the characters' words. These films include ""Papillion"", ""Roman Holiday"" and Exodus.

The only supplemental features are two deleted scenes of actors Paul Giamatti and Danny Glover reading letters that Trumbo wrote.

If you know the history of the blacklist you will find this film a reminder. If the word ""blacklist"" means nothing to you, then you owe it to yourself to see this film and show it to your family as well.

3918748,5,B002EP8FEM,"Just watched this on public TV .. still reeling emotionally ...
This presents in unflinching detail the devastating effect of the witch hunts of the McCarthy era as it impacted many talents in Hollywood, artists all over America and for Trumbo in particular. Movingly recorded and proudly - even defiantly - documented, it forces us to confront the inhumanity and shame of the ""blacklist"" and its consequences. We witness the shocking abuse of power and the shameful cowardice of betrayal as well as all the tragedy of its result. Presented in a true and fierce format by a variety of actors and by Trumbo himself...in his own brilliant and poignant words and in the words of his family... it shows these events with sharp clarity and without compromise.  Congratulations to all the people who participated in this presentation.  It was obviously created with passion for the truth and with dignity and fearlessness.

Trumbo was one of the so-called Hollywood 10, who refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee and the film follows his odyssey looking for a place to rest, as he negotiates the life of a writer with no name. (No wonder he could write such a brilliant screenplay for Exodus!) The film contains many clips of sage comments by Trumbo, as well as nice historical documentary footage, interviews with Hollywood stars and Trumbo's family members, and a nicely told description of the major events in Trumbo's life, such as the story of how Kirk Douglas revealed that Trumbo had written Spartacus under an assumed name.

3918829,4,B002EP8FEM,"Trumbo (and the other blacklisted citizens) could find no work under their own names after their convictions. Through letters, video of Trumbo being questioned after he survived these years, and recollections of friends and adult children of Trumbo and others blacklisted, we get a sense of what it was like to be an outcast at that time: little or no money and loans from friends just to survive; leaving your country in the hopes of a cheaper standard of living in Mexico only to find that American employers tended to not pay ex-pats; having to write under pseudonyms and so getting no credit for the writing you were able to sell; returning to America with your wife and children; having one of your children suffer terrible harassment and bullying at school because of being blacklisted; and through all this somehow raising a family and maintaining a marriage. eventually, through hard work, talent, and the help of friends who allow you to use their name as a front for your writing, you create top quality scripts, some oscar winners, and so that by the time you die and your children are adults, you've managed to attain some economic stability. horrible experiences for the Americans who suffered through this. in the film Spartacus when Trumbo wrote how all the characters banned together refusing to surrender Spartacus to the powers that be, it's easy to imagine that this was the world he wished existed, rather than the world as it was. a documentary well worth watching/owning.",1400025600,2,1493,4.905138339920948
3918830,4,B002EP8FEM,An excellent film about a horrifying time in our country (US) and in particular about a man who was brave enough to defy evildoers.  I suggest those interested should read the book of Trumbo's letters.,1379721600,3,201,4.742857142857143
3918831,5,B002EP8FEM,"A rare treat to have interviews and film footage of Trumbo himself within the context of his times.

3918834,4,B002EP8FEM,"Dalton Trumbo was an enormously gifted and committed screen writer, but he did not take the easy way when the postwar red scare era came. He suffered lack of recognition and economic privation because he would not become an informer against his friends, which was the price the McCarthyites demanded to allow honest artists to work.",1365033600,,332,4.946428571428571
3918835,5,B002EP8FEM,"This documentary not only shows the disastrous effects of blacklisting on Trumbo's professional career, but reveals the incredible damage the vicious witch hunt did  to his family. But, unlike others whose lives were completely ruined, the Trumbos persevered as a unit while Trumbo eventually had the last laugh - creatively if not financially --reclaiming his public status as an award-winning writer.

Highly recommend this along with other documentaries and movies about the destructive era orchestrated by duplicitous members of HUAC as well as by the unscrupulous McCarthy: ""Edward R. Murrow: The McCarthy Years""; ""Point of Order""; ""Guilty By Suspicion""starring DeNiro; Woody Allen's ""The Front""; and Clooney's ""Good Night and Good Luck""",1364083200,,742,5.675675675675675

3918837,2,B002EP8FEM,"As stated in my discussion, Trumbo was a communist for many years...and stayed long enough to help oust many American communists from the party. These were Americans who did not wish to tow the Stalinist line after the war. It was this fact, that made Arthur Schleshinger Jr., who like me, was anything but a red baiter, to write in the Village Voice, that he thought Trumbo, to be the ""last person"" who he would consider to be a defender of free speech. These were his words: ""the LAST PERSON"". This film's researchers did not do a balanced job to bring out this irony.

The film's producer in the discussion, wishes to create a feel good, self serving, smoke screen about these facts. I understand that Trumbo was hounded out of Hollywood, and should not have been, and that he suffered and perservered, yet this film does not state the whole truth.",1341532800,2,851,4.598684210526316

In the 1930's many joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression and the rise of Fascism. So too during WW II. The Cold War created suspicion of American Communists. This story begins in 1947 near Los Angeles. Trumbo wrote a novel and for movie pictures. There is a Hollywood party, Trumbo is there. There is a news film about a strike. A Congressman talks about subversives. A man insults Trumbo. Is he a dangerous radical? Does sharing a sandwich have political meaning? John Wayne speaks to an audience about his love for America. Wayne says its a new day. Trumbo is offered a contract with MGM, he writes happy endings. Trumbo receives a subpoena to testify in Washington about Communists in Hollywood. Trumbo bets any conviction will be reverseed by the Supreme Court. Will he risk his wealthy life?

Trumbo is questioned by a subcommittee. They want a yes or no answer. One man has lung cancer. The Hollywood Ten are charged with contempt. Hedda Hopper talks t a movie manager. The Hollywood Ten are fired in spite of contracts. They have a defense fund. Trumbo is found guilty of contempt. Can he find work? Should a writer cooperate and name his friends? Trumbo continues to write scripts for others to claim credit. A Supreme Court Justice died, his affects their appeal. Trumbo says goodbye to his children as he goes to prison. He gets a job in supply. J. Parnell Roberts is also in prison for tax evasion. The prisoners watch a movie. One write testifies he was duped and names names.

There are news films about Senator Joe McCarthy. Trumbo is released from prison and returns home. Trumbo finds work writing anonymously as a script doctor. A man doesnt like his neighbors. Trumbo develops his business while working at home. He works hard at night. One script needs a revision. Is it art? One writer asks Trumbo for help with a script. Is he working too hard now? One writer tells about his past. Trumbos actions affect his family. Producer King is threatened by a lobby; he reacts. The Brave One is hit for Robert Rich. Kirk Douglas has a script, Spartacus. Stripling from the HUAC questions Douglas. Otto Preminger visits Trumbo to talk about Exodus. Trumbo is interviewed for television about the blacklist. Trumbo gets credit for Spartacus, the film is picketed. President Kennedy praised the movie. The Writers Guild gives him an award in 1970. Trumbo speaks about the blacklist.

This is based on the book by Bruce Cook. It starts out good but declines in drama around the half-way mark. That Hollywood gossip columnist worked for the Hearst Press and did not go against her employers policies. Trumbo wrote the script for the 1974 movie Executive Action. Yes, Congress has the right to investigate whatever they think needs it. Its part of their legislative powers. Can they violate Constitutional rights too? Maybe, it all depends on what the Supreme Court may decide at a point in time.",1519430400,,2937,4.798418972332016
