5275117,5,B0096UG7VQ,"This documentary was quirky, funny, heart-wrenching and exhilarating. For anyone moving to a small community, watch this movie and take notes. There are few better ways to ingratiate yourself to a new place than to become part of the community, and these guys show you how that's done. Recommended.",1360368000,3,298,5.1020408163265305
5275118,5,B0096UG7VQ,"I was lucky enough to see this film at a Pride event in my home town this year.  The film was introduced by Jonathan Duffy who added a lot to the tale in his introduction.  The film is a documentary filmed in rural Queensland in Australia and covers the reaction of a small country town to their new, openly gay doctor and his partner.  Lots of laughs and a few sad moments too.  The great news is that the may be a sequel coming real soon.",1356912000,3,440,4.0813953488372094
5275119,5,B0096UG7VQ,"This Australian doco will strike a chord with anyone who has had to re-establish themselves in a new town. Vincent and Jonathan relocate from big-city  Brisbane to a small (very small!) town in Central Queensland. Jonathan has documented their move in this terrific film. While Vincent slotted quickly into a busy country medical practice, Jonathan was left to find ways to become a part of his new community. As ""the doctor's wife"" he had a certain role to play. The ways he does this, and the reactions and feelings of the townsfolk, (most of whom had never, to their knowledge, met anyone gay), is a revelation. Anyone contemplating a similar move could do much worse than follow some of Jonathan's advice.
This is a funny, and ultimately very moving, story and well worth the time to check it out",1355184000,5,800,4.755395683453237

8537101,5,B0096UG7VQ,I now a lot of doctors and doctor's wives who should see and learn from this movie. Hope there are updates soon.,1482796800,,112,4.136363636363637

8537103,5,B0096UG7VQ,"Loved the movie because it was ""real life"" and  very interesting. Having lived in a rural area and ""knowing"" what things can be like in rural townships it was a wonderful tale of how stereotypes and misconceptions can be totally wrong, as demonstrated in this movie.",1441065600,,266,4.782608695652174
8537104,3,B0096UG7VQ,"In spite of the amateurish production values, I found myself completely drawn in by this terrifically optimistic narrative. Looking forward to any biographical updates they choose to share with us...",1409097600,,199,5.666666666666667
8537105,5,B0096UG7VQ,"when I read some of the reviews, I almost skipped watching this little film. But I decided to watch it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed it. Jonathan is a very talented film maker and artist. I found this film to be interesting and worth the watch. Give it a try.",1374364800,2,282,4.339622641509434
8537106,1,B0096UG7VQ,"It has pre-amateurish production values that look like a 12 year old got into some video editing software, bad audio, no story, and a fair amount of self glorification and fake melodrama.  There were a couple laughs because of how bad it was, but otherwise it was a dreary waste of time and money.",1368403200,,297,4.5
8537107,1,B0096UG7VQ,"This movie is so utterly boring.  Why anyone would think this would be interesting to anyone is beyond me. It is just interview after interview after interview, as the director hopes to find someone in the small town to say something interesting or shocking. But they never do.",1366761600,,277,4.770833333333333
8537108,1,B0096UG7VQ,"my copy did not work, just had a pink screen will not bother sending back as makes it too expensive",1362873600,,99,4.0
8537109,3,B0096UG7VQ,"There's nothing wrong with the documentary. There's also nothing especially interesting, different, or new here.  For me, too many unanswered questions remained about how and why doctor was so dissatisfied in his practice, while all the townspeople raved about him being the best doctor ever.  There must be a contractual reason why this topic received such light treatment, when, in fact, the doctor's unhappiness, which wasn't adequately documented or explained, was,the reason they gave for the couple moving to a new town and a different practice.",1361145600,,551,5.395348837209302
