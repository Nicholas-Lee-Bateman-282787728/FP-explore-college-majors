8226758,1,B000X2ZY8S,The picture quality of this video is extremely poor. You would think it was produced in the 70's with how poor it looks. What a waste of money! I originally purchased several of the videos from Shawn Trautman with the intentions of using them with some friends to expand on our dancing lessons. One of my friends recently said she wanted to get together to use the videos but I told her not to waste her time. They truly are terrible.,1514419200,,434,4.37037037037037
