1735771,3,B00006ADFQ,"Read the other reviews for plot synopsis and film description.  I will say that the script is a bit lacking, but with the skillful acting and direction, the script serves to show the characters as more genuine people (except Daniel, who is far too dramatically cute).  Most of us are not typically well-scripted and most of our characters are not well-educated, making their dialogue all the more believable. Adiel Stein (Pete O'Malley) is the real gem of this film.  His sincerity, playfulness and inquisitiveness just roll off the screen.  He is a joy to watch and listen to.
The problem is that this movie is based on the false ideas of insincere, works-based, self-gratifying religiosity.  It is typical, and with cause, that Roman Catholicism is used for the framework of such heretical portrayal of Christianity and the relationship of God and man.  Although this is a heart-warming story of a young boy trying to do good and the friendships he develops, the genuine fact is that it is a typical contemporary perversion of biblical Christianity.  Religion is portrayed as subjective, relative, and the construct that people have created and use to deal with tragedy or organize their lives.  In that way it is right in step with Freudian postmodern culture.  The most blasphemous statement comes at the end when Peter O'Malley says to Rabbi Jacobsen, ""Jesus is just a symbol.""  No, Pete, you may have been taught that or inferred it from the vague religion you've been raised with, but Jesus is not a symbol.  He is the perfect son of God, who died on a cross for the sins of humanity, and is the only way to salvation.  Read your bible, don't just let someone tell you about it. The reinforcement of working for your salvation, that doing good means being good and that that somehow obligates God to ignore your sin, is what biblical doctrine strictly refutes.  Read Paul's letter to the Galatians and it should be much clearer.
Watch the movie, enjoy it, just don't believe in anything it says about salvation or the nature of our relationship to God.",1048032000,11,2059,4.798866855524079
1735772,5,B00006ADFQ,"It is in some way, very refreshing to see religion being presented in a movie from 2002 and in such a positive light. Too often the religious leaders in movies are ridiculed and unless we had personally met a kind and generous teacher of spirituality, one would imagine them less than desirable people to know. Here we have a Rabbi and a Priest who make an impact on a young boys life in a positive way.

This movie is obviously supposed to be a ""cute"" way to unveil the childishness we as adults possess in regards to our attitudes to various cultures and religions. In other words, the message is that we are all humans and should seek to care and love all human beings despite our insistence on choosing a particular religion for our own spiritual satisfaction.

There are some strikingly true statements in this movie. For one, the Rabbi states that when people are asked to think, that is when they get angry. This is particularly true about us humans when someone confronts us with spiritual issues. The human with an open mind will listen, consider the options and make his own decision. The human with a closed mind will not want to discuss various options and generally will want to impose his/her beliefs on the individual who he feels is wrong.

I prefer to think that in life you can express your beliefs in an open way and then not necessarily look for acceptance, but look for an open exchange of ideas. In my online wanderings, I've always found the most enjoyable discussions on religion are between two people who are willing to listen.

In this movie, the ""pride"" the adults feel overshadows their basic human qualities like love, caring and a realization of a common human element.

I liked how the Rabbi explained spiritual teaching as something you can offer freely and cannot sell. You cannot buy your way to heaven.

In this movie, the way to heaven is not presented. There is no discussion as to why it is important to believe in Jesus Christ. The cross is mentioned and then there is a distinction between Judaism and Catholicism. However, the actual fact of asking Jesus to forgive our sins is not discussed.

At first you will wonder why Catholic Pete O'Malley (Adi Stein) wants to convert a Jewish person. Our only clue is that his teacher (a nun) at school has asked him which path he will choose. The way to hell or to heaven? He thinks he can please his teacher by converting someone to his religion. His father tells him not to try to change the world at his age. He is eight-years old and yet has the enthusiasm of a missionary during his 1976 summer vacation.

Pete's conclusions about religion end up to be very universal and open minded. They are worth thinking about. How many children take their eternal destiny that seriously, let alone the destiny of their friends.

The beauty in this movie is more in the element of ""caring"" for others despite their religious beliefs. The message is not really about ""converting"" anyone to your religion. It is ""accepting"" others as Jesus would. In accepting us all, Jesus makes a way for us to enter heaven. In this fact, there is great beauty. You don't have to be a member of any particular religion to believe in Jesus Christ.

I am about to listen to ""Jesus: His Life and Teachings"" by Joseph F. Girzone. Lately, I have felt a need to do more research on the life of Christ and this movie was perhaps part of my journey.

I can't really agree with Pete when he says that ""anyone"" could take the place of the name of Christ. No one else gave their life for all human beings and took on the weight of our sin, nor has anyone else ever claimed to have defeated death.

This movie presents the ""way to heaven"" in an almost humorous way. Good works and living a good life are emphasized. In the end, ""good"" is said to be more important than acceptance of a savior. I think the element of ""pride"" is most interesting and appears at various points during the movie.

To really accept Christ, you have to give up your pride and accept the ""help"" of a God who loves you. We can't ever be ""good enough"" to make it. We can make good decisions.

Interesting and thoughtful movie. It also contains some emotional elements that are interesting and the main actor is so cute. What a bright, young actor. He was like sunshine throughout the movie.

He is a good example of a person filled with the love of God, but if he was a real person and not just a character in the movie, it would be interesting to see how he changed as he grew older. Perhaps it is easier to have faith when we are children.

A movie you can actually watch without worrying about offending the children. It will probably offend some adults. There is the charm. It makes you think.

1735773,4,B00006ADFQ,"American films deal with all aspects of every day life: work, school, marriage, family, divorce, adolescence, sexuality, crime, alcoholism, drugs, disease, death - the range of subjects is virtually endless.  Yet if you were to look to films to get some sense of what defines American culture, you would never know that religion played any kind of role at all in the lives of the common, ordinary citizen.  Spirituality seems to be the one aspect of life that never gets acknowledged even by the most incisive of filmmakers.  Of course, we do occasionally run across the serial killer who claims to be doing ""the Lord's work"" as he's butchering his victims, or the diabolical Catholic Church hierarchy plotting the deaths of hundreds to maintain its nefarious hold on its riches and power, or the sleazy evangelist who is out there bilking millions out of their life savings in exchange for a phony one way ticket to eternal glory.  But we almost never see just plain garden-variety folks who go to church, value their faith and try to make their religion an intricate part of their workaday lives.  Why is that?
Well, ""Stolen Summer"" is that rare American film which actually acknowledges that religion plays a key role in many people's lives.  It's Chicago, 1976, and 8-year old Pete O'Malley, fearful of going to hell, is on a quest to assure his place in heaven by converting neighborhood Jews to the Christian faith.  As part of his effort, he enlists the aid of a local rabbi who, admiring Pete's honesty and willingness to seek for Truth, agrees to let the boy set up a lemonade-cum-salvation stand outside his temple.  The film deals with a wide array of characters, including members of Pete's family as well as the rabbi's, who have varying reactions to both Pete's stated goal and the burgeoning friendship between Pete and the rabbi's own son.
""Stolen Summer"" is not afraid to confront the sectarian nature of religion that is often used as a means of dividing people of faith rather than bringing them together.  Moreover, by viewing the world through the unfiltered eyes of these two innocent young boys, writer/director Pete Jones points up the empty ritualism that often defines how we adults choose to practice our faith.  Pete and Danny, by cutting through the layers of nonsense and getting to the simple heart of the matter, force many of the grownups in the film to re-evaluate their own beliefs and practices.
It's also nice to see a family in a film that, although it has problems, is not thoroughly angst-ridden and dysfunctional.  The O'Malley's are an intact Irish Catholic family whose eight children are a clear testament to the couple's adherence to papal decrees on birth control.  In an excellent, multi-layered performance, Aidan Quinn plays Pete's father, Joe, a hard-working fireman who is proud of his ethnic roots and who feels that the most important role for a man in this world is to take care of his family.  Yet, Joe has problems of his own.  For one thing, he has an excessive sense of pride that prevents him from wanting his children to have a better life than the one he has made for them.  He believes that his college-aged son should be content to work as a dutiful civil servant rather than pursue his dream of becoming a doctor.  Moreover, Joe obviously fears what he doesn't know or understand and this comes out in subtle flashes of anti-Semitism, which put him in direct conflict with the rabbi and even his own son at times.  Joe is, in many ways, the most interesting character in the film mainly because Jones is careful not to peg him as either a total hero or total villain.  Bonnie Hunt and Kevin Pollack offer strong support as Joe's levelheaded wife and the open-minded rabbi, respectively.  And young Adiel Stein scores big time as the centerpiece of the film, little Pete O'Malley.  Stein conveys an upbeat childlike innocence that is infectious without becoming cutesy or cloying.  He is utterly believable as a young boy coming-of-age in a suburban home in the 1970's.
""Stolen Summer,"" because it deals gently with its people and its subject matter, may strike some as a bit too mild in tone, a bit too lacking in grit to be worth very much.  And, in a sense, they may be right.  The film does sometimes come off a bit like one of those ""good for you"" After School Specials designed to deliver an upbeat, heartwarming message about the goodness of mankind without unduly upsetting anyone in the audience.  And the movie does feel a bit contrived at times, more concerned with wringing tears or teaching a lesson than it is in capturing life in its rawest form for all of us to see.  But no matter.  It's still a pleasure to see a film at least attempting to acknowledge both that people do think about religion and God from time to time in this world and that we all don't come from families torn asunder by personal trauma.  Yes, one could perhaps wish for a bit more edginess at times - still, ""Stolen Summer"" merits praise for bringing religion back into the mainstream of American movies.",1044403200,18,5056,4.728929384965832
1735774,2,B00006ADFQ,"Let's just hope that Pete Jones sticks with directing movies instead of writing screenplays.  The plot is trite and manipulative ... and PREDICTABLE.  But it was still fun to see the finished product after watching the Project Greenlight series on HBO.  If you forgive the script, the film-making aspect of the movie is better than I expected.  It's still worth your time if you're curious about the way it turned out.",1042588800,4,418,4.845070422535211
1735775,4,B00006ADFQ,"In the face of numerous obstacles, the heart of young 8 yr old Pete O'Malley drives himself through the challenge of his young life thus far:  Help a Jew get to heaven.
Lost in a Irish Catholic family of 10, Pete take his first steps in becoming a young man by completing his quest and ,in his mind, is maturing to a level that will prepare him to be a fourth grader without a future in hell.
Despite the objections of his near-alcoholic father (aidan quinn), busy mother (Bonnie Hunt) with 8 kids, non-understanding priest (Brian Dennehy), and missing a summer of baseball, Pete finds encouragement in the open minded Rabbi Jacobsen (Kevin Pollack) in his quest to find Jews that want to go to heaven.  As fate would have it, Rabbi Jacobsen's son Danny has lukemia.  Danny also has a desire to go to heaven.
This movie is a journey into being open minded.  Through both the tragedy of the death of a child and the optimism of another child, adults in the life of Pete O'Malley learn to confront their prejudices and develop the ability to re-evaluate their motives for their actions toward others.
Good chemistry between the actors.  Touching, informative, and yes funny, I recommend STOLEN SUMMER.  I recommend that everyone purchase the entire PROJECT GREENLIGHT SEASON 1 DVD which includes this movie.",1042243200,2,1305,4.752212389380531
1735776,4,B00006ADFQ,"After watching Project Greenlight on HBO, I was expecting a poor movie. However, I was plesantly surprised with its quality. This movie has a great message for all no matter what your religion is. I especially like how the movie makes us understand that the ""us verses them"" metality that some people have about their religion is wrong. Also, listening to how the two boys view the world and religion was a delight.
Although it does have a few minor curse words, I would still recommend it as a family movie for children who are about 8 years old or older. Depending on the maturity of the child.",1034035200,,596,4.527777777777778
1735777,4,B00006ADFQ,"This was the script that won the ""Project Greenlight"" contest.  First-time writer/director Pete Jones was given the opportunity to give us a tale about family and faith.  And it all takes place in Chicago.  I admit, I was a little worried at first, and was even a little doubtful of the movie being any good.  There were a lot of things that went wrong for Pete and the crew during the filming of this movie.  I guess they only showed us what went wrong because there must've been a lot of things that went right that we didn't get to see.  Because ""Stolen Summer"" is a wonderful film that's filled with humor and heart.
The movie is about Pete O'Malley, a young boy in an Irish-Catholic family.  He's worried that he isn't going to Heaven and wants to find a way to assure God that he's worthy.  He gets the idea of converting the Jewish so they can go to Heaven.  He meets Rabbi Jacobson, who finds Pete's Quest to be creative and caring, despite his religious beliefs.  That is when Pete meets and befriends Rabbi Jacobson's son, Danny.  Pete wants to convert Danny in hopes that they will both make it to heaven.  It is a very emotional and sincere movie that plays on all of your emotions.
I'm not a very religious person, I admit, but I found the movie to be very creative and entertaining.  The script does take risks, but the overall product is presented to us in a way that we can't help but smile and even laugh at times.  As the movie progresses, we learn it isn't just about religious differences, it's about the friendship of two boys trying to make sense of the world around them.
The acting was really superb, especially from the two boys.  They did a really great job in the film.  The cast also includes Aidan Quinn, Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Pollak, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Brian Dennehy.  Aidan does an awesome job playing Pete's father, who can be quite humorous in his ignorance at times.  He can be forceful, but caring at the same time.  Bonnie Hunt also fills the film with light as the mother.  Kevin Pollak is great as the Rabbi, who can show us his humorous and serious side.  Everybody did their roles justice.
Pete Jones does a really great job, being that this is his first film.  Remember, this is a man who has never had any prior experience in film, or at least none that I have heard of.  Sure, there were some mistakes, but then again, what film DOESN'T have mistakes?
I really enjoyed listening to the commentary, which was done by the director, co-producer and producer Chris Moore.  It was funny and informative.  They even point out some of the mistakes that happen during the film.  (If they had kept their mouths shut, I probably would've never noticed any of them!)  I usually don't listen to commentary, but after seeing the ""Project Greenlight"" series, it was almost like I had to listen to it.  I'm glad I did.
Overall, ""Stolen Summer"" is a terrific film.  Pete Jones and the rest of the crew should be proud of themselves.  You don't have to be very religious to enjoy this movie, so don't let make you think you will not like it.  DO NOT BUY THE MOVIE ITSELF IF YOU PLAN TO GET THE SERIES!  The series already includes the full length movie with all of the special features that are included on this DVD.  One of the better movies to come out of 2002, if you ask me.  It may not be perfect, but it's still a heart-warming gem.  A great film for the whole family.",1033171200,24,3401,4.404494382022472

But I am the Way , the Truth, etc  is taken from a Gnostic gospel, and Jesus would have not been so arrogant as to think He was the only way.

1735835,5,B00006ADFQ,"I know absolutely *nothing* about anything even remotely related to religion so expect a terrible review on my part but... here goes anyway.

Stolen Summer is about a young boy who's a Catholic, and he makes it his own personal mission to convert a Jewish boy into a Catholic because, according to the Catholic boy, Jewish people aren't accepted into heaven.  Is this true?  Beats me.  Like I said, my knowledge concerning religion is extremely limited.  I've heard of God, Jesus and Mary.  Does Goliath count?  Making the family *Irish* Catholics just confuses me even more.

Anyway, the best a film like this can accomplish for a clueless person like myself concerning a subject I have no understanding of is to give me a positive message that if you pray hard enough, you too will be accepted into heaven regardless of your religion.

The interaction between the two young boys is really interesting though- easily the highlight.  They go on adventures together such as skipping rocks at the beach and attempting to figure out each others religious beliefs by communicating with each other whenever the two are together.

I'm not so sure it was appropriate to drag cancer into the storyline.  Seriously, that can drive ANY person (religious or not) completely crazy regardless of their beliefs, because such a thing can take a serious toll on a person.

Another interesting aspect of the storyline is the father who's always defensive and demanding, especially towards the older son.  The father has huge aspirations for his oldest son and where he would like his son to work for a living, but the son constantly argues that he'd prefer a different life instead.  These segments are really good.

Both the Catholic and Jewish families are very considerate and understanding towards their own family, so if there's a message here that religious people are better at raising families compared to non-religious families, well, I probably couldn't disagree there.  Of course, this is entirely assuming ALL religious people are like the ones portrayed in the movie.

I don't know exactly what kind of person this film is intended for.  People who don't follow religion won't understand it, and people who attend church every Sunday will have a ""been there, done that"" feeling by its conclusion, so I dunno.",1297468800,,2304,4.968668407310705
1735836,1,B00006ADFQ,"I was very displeased with this movie. Leave it to hollywood! This movie teaches a Lie and then at the end I was hoping maybe someone was going to come in and reveal the truth but then the little boy says to the rabbi that you don't have to pray to Jesus and that you can pray in any name to get to heaven. Lie! Its not about a ritual each Sunday and worshiping statues. John 14:6 , The word of God which is the Bible teaches there's only one Way, Truth and Life and that is Jesus Christ alone! The Bible also teaches Acts 4:12 niether is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved... (Acts 16:31).Galations 5:5For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Galations 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Rev. 22:15 Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. It can't be done. You can not get into heaven by being good, because no one can be good enough. The Bible makes this very clear in numerous passages. Here are a few, starting with one of the most famous:For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law."" (NASB) Romans 3:28. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast."" (NIV) Ephesians 2:8-9. If then by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace."" (NIV) Romans 11:6

Catholics scored low on their knowledge of the Bible, their knowledge of other religions, and their knowledge of their own religion.

""Stolen Summer"" ends with the heretical notion that it doesn't matter whose name you call on as long as that person represents good.  It would be a cute movie if salvation wasn't a critical issue.",1294272000,3,621,4.990291262135922
1735838,5,B00006ADFQ,"A young Irish-Catholic boy living in 1970s Chicago gets the idea that he can avoid going to hell, as his Catholic School teacher suggests he will if he does not make some changes, if he is able to complete a quest to help someone else get to Heaven. So, as soon as school is out for the summer he goes in search of someone to help.  His quest leads him to a Jewish Synagogue where he meets an open-minded Rabbi.  The Rabbi agrees to let the boy set up a lemonade stand in front of the synagogue in his effort to help others.  The story progresses and the Catholic boy meets the Rabbi's son, and he agrees to take on the challenge of the quest...a modified form of a decathalon in the days when Bruce Jenner was considered the greatest athlete in the world.

Time goes on, and the families of the Catholic boy and the Jewish boy face questions from their young sons about life, death, and faith.

This film, though perhaps a little lacking in the current style of Hollywood blockbusters (which certainly isn't all bad)  delivers a powerful message about family, friendship, faith, and religion.

The costuming, props, and presentation of the 1970s rang true to me...all the way down to the banana-seat bicycles and pick-up baseball games.  In addition, though I'm not Catholic, I grew up in a predominantly Catholic area outside of New Orleans, and some of my friends attended Catholic school.  The movie's portrayal of life in Catholic school seemed like what they used to tell me about what it was like for them.

Oh, and Bonnie Hunt turns in a particularly engaging performance.  I love the scene in the car when one of her teenaged sons is swearing and she handles the situation.  The rest of the roles are also well-cast.

Growing up in a large Irish-Catholic family, it was fun to watch the dynamics and chaos. The adult dialogue was great. I laughed out loud at a few parts (especially the mother cussing at her son for cussing. Priceless!). Then it all started to grate on me: the stereotypical overdrinking, bigoted, angry Irishman. The whole raft of adults who didn't have a decent answer to a child's sincere questions. But what really ruined it for me was the totally bizarre twist at the end. I'm not naive, I don't expect a decent doctrinal approach in a movie made for the general public. But this was the worst trash I've ever seen. Jesus as a symbol? A rabbi agreeing that calling God by his dead son's name is a good idea??  I expect the kids to have bizarre religious ideas. They're kids, after all. But no eight year old would come up with the rubbish the writer(s) gave this character. The religious views sold to us at the end of this movie were probably meant to leave the viewers feeling good, and safe, and confident. I was just appalled and insulted.",1278288000,7,1251,4.511013215859031

1735856,5,B00006ADFQ,"This is the story of the relationship of two boys during the summer of 1976 in Chicago.  Early on, one boy tells the other of the need to stay focused.  The movie uses the story to develop that theme.  The boys are on their quest to be good and get to heaven, and their fathers are on a parallel quest to keep their fears at bay and be good fathers and husbands.  The scenes and scripts of 1976 seem to be very true to life, and the acting is wonderful as we watch these two young people grow during their short friendship.  The use of opposites: age, religion, education, sex; all seem to draw the story together, as well as the use of humor and sadness.  Since I'm a huge Bonnie Hunt fan, I was looking forward to seeing her again, and I wasn't disappointed.  She is, as always right on the money.  Enjoy!",1204761600,,807,4.194805194805195

1735874,3,B00006ADFQ,"Surprising because its inherent gentleness has been overshadowed by the harsh realities of producing it.  It would be better to see this movie first, THEN watch the Project Greenlight series, because the backstabbing, budgetary problems and logistical nightmares would come as a surprise, not as a dark cloud that hangs over an otherwise first-rate effort.  (It seems Miramax made a an enormous error holding the release of the movie up until well after the series had aired.  It should have been released at the end of the series, as the vastly inferior ""Battle of Shaker Heights"" was.)

There is nothing slick or Hollywood about this film, which helps the viewer focus on the story of a youngster's quest to do good and to help his dying friend get to Heaven.  Kevin Pollack and Aiden Quinn give great performances, Quinn as an angry, edgy fireman and Pollack as a Rabbi dealing with more than his share of adversity.  Pete Biagi's cinematography is straightforward but stylish, and Pete Jones turns in a great effort with this, his first film.  It should be judged on its own merits, not as a coda to the Chris Moore/Jeff Balis/Pat Peach inter-personal dynamics that raged around it.",1111276800,3,1186,4.870646766169155

1735877,4,B00006ADFQ,"I chanced upon this movie on cable, but Stolen Summer isn't the kind of film that gets made too often nowadays -- light and cute, but balanced with a touching serious side that carries universal messages about religion, God, love, family, growing up.
The director's style is of the point-and-shoot variety, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as over-the-top visual flourishes likely would've taken our attention away from the ample dialogue. The script contains a good amount of surprises, and the character development is quite caringly done.
A word for the acting. Though the characters get gritty on occasion, the film is paced very well. Some protagonists are young (kids) but their work is impressively natural. Bonnie Hunt in particular should have merited more screen time, she works a taut but tender magic as a straight-talking mother.
If you care for meaningful cinema, I think this would make for a very worthwhile rental.",1084060800,8,934,5.111111111111111

If my dream comes true as Mr. Jones' dream did, then I hope that my film turns out as well as his!  GREAT JOB PETE!!!  Can't wait to see your next film!",1063929600,3,421,4.024096385542169
1735879,4,B00006ADFQ,"A touching and thought provoking film. It makes me sad that producer Chris Moore is ashamed of this film. Or one might think he is. I mean if you saw the last season of ""Project Greenlight"" he doesn't speak highly of this first film produced by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and himself for season one of HBO's Project Greenlight. Perhaps Mr. Moore bases his feelings on how much money the movie made, which was very little. I think we all know that there are countless movies out there that bombed at the box office, but prove to be wonderful and meaningful motion pictures. I liked ""Stolen Summer"" because it asked questions we all have. It features a first rate cast including Aidan Quinn, Kevin Pollak, Eddie Kaye Thomas & Bonnie Hunt. I would have liked to see more of Bonnie Hunt, she is an absolute delight on screen. Check her out in larger roles like ""Return to Me"" & ""Only You"" also. The story revolves around an 8 year old Catholic boy who is on a quest to get a younger friend (a Jewish boy) into heaven. ~A great film, good for family viewing if you can get the younger kiddies to take the deep subject matter seriously.",1063411200,10,1127,4.423076923076923
1735880,3,B00006ADFQ,"It's 1976.  8-year-old boy Pete is living with his Irish family in Chicago; his dad is a fire fighter Aidan Quinn, and his mother is Bonnie Hunt, both parents being religious Catholics.  One day Pete thinks about a very unique theory on Jewish people and the Heaven, and puts it into practice.
Then he gets acquainted with a Jewish boy Danny; Pete, following his childish idea, believes that his new friend cannot go to the Heaven, and tries to ""save"" him with a decathron test.  But soon Pete must realise that the idea of going to the Heaven means not exactly what he has so far innocently envisioned.
OK, as other reviewers say, this is the first film resulted from the 'Project Greenlight,' a competition held on the Net to help aspiring directors realize their dreams.  That project started in the autumn of 2000, and it is reported that as many as 12,000 scripts applied to the contest.  This film is the winner which is co-produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, supportes of the project.  But 12,000!?
I say this because the charm of ""Stolen Summer"" does not in fact come from the script.  The greatest asset of the film is its veteran actors like Aidan Quinn, Bonnie Hunt, Brian Dennehy, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and best of all Kevin Pollack as Danny's father.  The acting is unanimously strong; especially that of Pollack as compassionate and tender-hearted father should be long remembered, sustained by deftly expressed humor and touching pathos.
Now, let me say what I have to say.  (Don't say I am a harsh guy, please.)  Strangely, and regrettably, the two leading child actors are not good.  Their facial expressions are not as convincing as they should be, and when we know that fact, we also know the very conspicuous flaw of the film: too sentimental and clithed plot.  The story looks sometimes very  contrived.  The plot concerning the religious idea is, I find, too shallow to make us really think (even considering it is uttered by a child), and the descriptions of Pete's family are actually nothing but too familiar images we have seen before, like stubborn, beer-drinking dad who loves baseball.  (Please!)  And I could not find the boy Pete so realistic as other characters to make us care him and his friend.  I know some kids have original ideas about religion, but I don't think not many would try to 'convert' other people.
Clearly the film is a well-intentioned attempt of creating a family picture with some thought-provoking ideas about ethnic and religious matters, but ironically that provocative part sounds most unrealistic in the whole story.",1062979200,6,2575,4.8159090909090905
1735881,3,B00006ADFQ,"Stolen Summer is Project Greenlight winner Pete Jones' story of a Catholic boy and the Jewish friend he tries to convert in 1976.  The plot is interesting, particularly since religion is so rarely mentioned in American film, and Jones' script is okay, if sometimes repetitive.  The adult actors (Aidan Quinn, Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Pollak) are excellent, and the film is worth watching if only for its curiosity factor as the first film from the Project Greenlight (PG) group, though it would be more entertaining and informative to watch the PG series in addition to the film.
DVD extras include a trailer; Jones' 3-minute PG-winning submission as well as the scene as it was later filmed for theatrical release; a commentary track with writer-director Jones, producer Chris Moore and coproducer Jeff Balis; 2 deleted scenes with commentary.",1058832000,6,838,5.154411764705882
