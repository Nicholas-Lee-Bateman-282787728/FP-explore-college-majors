8430002,5,B004I43FYW,"Well I wasn't expecting UK english but I don't mind at all. In fact I think it makes it more interesting. My 2 year old doesn't seem to mind at all, and DH and I get a big kick out of it. Very entertaining!",1337817600,,206,3.7045454545454546
8430003,5,B004I43FYW,"My grandson is a huge fan of Chugginton.  He gets excited and it grabs his full attention.  The characters are cute and engaging, and the lessons are appropriate for young audiences. His mother is also a fan.  It's good, clean, educational fun.",1331856000,,244,4.761904761904762
8430004,4,B004I43FYW,"When the description said English and French, and it was sold on the USA Amazon (amazon.com vs amazon.co.uk), I thought it meant American English.  However, whenever I play this DVD on my portable player, it is in European English.  Not the worst thing in the world, and perhaps this has more audio tracks (my portable DVD play isn't the easiest to work with on options).

With all that said, my 23 month old loves the DVD.  It entertained him for hours on recent road trip.",1325116800,2,474,4.541176470588235
