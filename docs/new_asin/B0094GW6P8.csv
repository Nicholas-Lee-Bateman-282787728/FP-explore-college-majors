This is a family movie about a man who was only fooling himself when he told his family that he is working to provide for them.  He may have given them a lot of material things but that is not the important his family they wanted him, but he was a workaholic. This movie tells the story of greed...Greed is so destructive.

5262329,5,B0094GW6P8,"This was a movie I am going to keep on my Watch List so that I can share it with my grandchildren when they come to visit. A movie with a real message--about the things that are really important in life. One thing that I was astounded by as I watch it, was that the teenage kid playing in it looked almost just like one of my older grandchildren--it was amazing.

You don't really know or appreciate what you have until you loose it-- as Percy found out the hard way. There was more than one message in this story. For one thing, if you give, you always get back more than your receive. Another thing, that love and family is more important than any money or material thing you may have.  You should always make your loved ones your most important priority in life--without them, there is no real quality of life left.

I can't say enough good things about this movie and can't wait to share it with my loved ones. It does not have to be Christmas to appreciate and enjoy this movie.",1456790400,2,983,4.274193548387097

Christmas Eve has arrived and Percy is still hard at work late into the night, once again breaking his promises to his wife and kids. Percy is about to experience some consequences for his actions without redemption.

8535941,4,B0094GW6P8,"I loved the story, but the acting and the picture are always so poor with these great family movies, that have no budget!

Give others a break for trying to spread some goodness & love around!!!",1511827200,,368,4.676923076923077
