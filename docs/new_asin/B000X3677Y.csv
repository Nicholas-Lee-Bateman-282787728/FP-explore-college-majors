8226804,3,B000X3677Y,"The Mantra Om DVD as a work of art is quite lovely, though possibly not exactly what it purports to be. Filmed around the Adi Vajra Shambhasalem Ashram in Wasa, BC (not too far from the Washington/Idaho border), the natural beauty of the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, and the peaceful-looking disciples of Guruji Hamsah Nandatha, and a nice selection of New Age and Indo-pop music were made for a pleasant viewing experience.

However, the ""teachings"" seemed to be some sort of New Age ""hodge-podge"" that attempted to relate the sacred sound ""OM"" to such disparate traditions as Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism - Buddhism was in there as well, but it has a close historical connection to Hinduism. The others, not so much. Throughout the film I sensed I was peeking in on the teachings of a cult with its own unique take an the traditions it had appropriated and harmonized. (I don't mean the word ""cult"" as a negative--""new religion"" would also work.)

I am just a lay student of yoga and Buddhism, so I have no academic credentials to back me up. But after doing a little searching online I discovered that Guruji Hamsah Nandatha was initiated by S. Hamsah Manarah (a.k.a. Gilbert Bourdin) who founded a religion called l'Aumisme in French, Aumism, in English. at the Mandarom Monastery in France during the 90s. After learning more about Aumism, I better appreciated the ""Mulligan Stew"" of varying practices with Guruji's philosophical musings the stone (or nail?) pinning them all together.

Other reviewers possibly much better versed in mantra practice than I have given the mantra discussion in this DVD high praise--and I can offer no specific critique. It may be my own limitations as a yogi and meditator, and perhaps some anti-New Age bias, but a lot of the teaching in this DVD came across as a collection of New Age 'buzzwords' attempting to press the point that ""all religions are ONE"" etc.

Well, in some sense, they are. But people with a more traditional experience with some of the various teaching traditions woven together like the colors of the rainbow scarves worn by Guruji Hamsah Nandatha's students might experience some color-clash in the midst of the quest for harmony and universal brotherhood, embodied in the sacred sound, OM.

 As pleasing a presence as the soft-speaking, French-accented Guruji was, I couldn't take him very seriously. I think I would get better vetted information from someone like Georg Feuerstein or Thomas Ashley-Farrand.

Again, I am no expert, and I did enjoy the video as a work of art. I just couldn't take the teaching seriously.

Om Shanti.",1379462400,,2615,4.9407744874715265
8226805,4,B000X3677Y,"This video is very well produced, and explains in very basic detail the Mantra Om.  Since my initiation to the mantra and to meditation in the early 70s from my teachers who were direct students of Ajahn Chah, Dipa Ma, Neem Karoli Baba and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.  I have, with much humility acquired a small amount of knowledge of the use of mantras, making use of them and abandoning them, as the need arises.  It is my thought that the creators of this video be commended on their hard and thoughtful work in compiling this knowledge and presenting it in this format for the benefit of those who wish to know more about the mantra and the use of mantras.  The content is enjoyable and easy to understand.  I would not, however advise someone who has been indoctrinated to a specific tradition of meditation, to use this as a training method, as it may interfere with his or her current system of meditation.",1253232000,4,913,4.5426829268292686
8226806,3,B000X3677Y,"The film claims to be ""All that you want to know about the Sacred Word of God.""

Personally, I would have preferred to learn still more about this mantra, rather than so many scenes of religious rites, etc., where little information is conveyed.

For an instance among many, one particular scene obviously shows the guru explaining to two disciples exactly how a mala, or Hindu rosary, is used; but we can't hear what he is saying.

Also, the Om symbol is apparently complex and made up parts which themselves are symbolic of the four states of consciousness, but this breakdown is never shown or explained, although the four states of consciousness are referred to elsewhere in the film.

For a work of great depth and breadth which includes, among much else,  materials on the Om mantra, I recommend Russill Paul's book, ""The Yoga of Sound.""",1251417600,4,843,4.786206896551724

It is extraordinarily well done in all respects, and packs an incredible amount of wisdom- and beauty- into such a short span of time.
Thank you for this wonderful teaching!",1215907200,2,326,4.603448275862069

This video is instructive and it shows us an interesting as well as fascinating way of viewing life.
