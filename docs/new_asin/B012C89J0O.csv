7346710,4,B012C89J0O,"The video quality on these discs are amazing.  The colors are really vibrant, and everything looks MUCH crisper than it did online.

The default audio IS in English, but I personally feel like the poor quality of the dub is EXTREMELY over exaggerated. English previews that found their way online before the disc's release were obviously cherry picked. It's not amazing, and it definitely has its bad moments, but, overall, it's a pretty solid dub.  Virus and Trip are definitely the worst offenders, and Aoba's voice seemed out of place more often than not, but the rest of the cast felt very fitting---especially with Greg Ayres voicing Clear, and whoever was voicing Noiz (can't recall a name).

If you just can't find yourself getting into the dub, just watch it in the original Japanese with the subs---which I have no complaints about.

All in all, I personally felt this was a solid adaption from the game (minus the removal of the yaoi, sans the OVA).  Visual novels can be hard to adapt because of all the plot branches, and this did a decent enough job of getting in major points from everyone's routes.",1452643200,3,1113,4.740932642487047

But I recommend do not watch the OVA cause it's like a boys love episode unless you like that kind of stuff like me. But still I loved this anime. The episode that I keep watching is the OVA. I've watched it like 15 times. I'm too addicted to this anime and the OVA. OK, I'll shut up now. Bye ",1451520000,2,382,3.961038961038961

7346717,4,B012C89J0O,"This is a review for the DVD version of Dramatical Murder. Dramatical Murder is a sci-fi, drama anime. This anime collection comes with 12 episodes with an OVA on 3 DVD's. For audio options, there is an English dub plus the original Japanese voice over included with English subtitles option. Extras only include clean opening and ending options. This anime is an adaption of a BL (boys love) visual novel game. I've never played the game but from what I read this anime follows the common route from the game's story. For the 12 episodes in this collection, even though this anime is based off a BL game, there is very little to no romance between the male characters. I wouldn't classify this anime as a yaoi but a shounen-ai instead. There is a kiss and some romantic moments in a sense in the story but you're not gonna find any ""yaoi"" sex scenes in the 12 episodes. The visual novel game is hardcore yaoi but the anime is just shounen-ai. I discussed the 12 episodes, now for the OVA (13th episode) that is included. The OVA is a bonus episode which includes/covers all the bad endings from the game. For the OVA I would actually consider it yaoi even though the scenes are censored in some form but its pretty obvious what's going on. Overall Dramatical Murder is a decent anime. I think its a good treat for the fans of the visual novel. If you're a hardcore yaoi fan, this anime might not satisfy your tastes. Like I mentioned before this is more shounen-ai than yaoi.",1449360000,12,1476,4.5111940298507465

7346719,5,B012C89J0O,"Arrived overnight like I wanted and paid for. The discs are all there, nothing had popped out of place, brand new, no scratches on disks, and blister pack was sealed. The third disk includes an OVA episode even that CrunchyRoll didn't have. I've loved this series for a long time and I am absolutely THRILLED to have it on DVD now.

What you get with this is the DVD series, NOT blu-ray if that's what you're looking for. I wanted the DVD so this is the one I ordered. You get three disks in the case. There are twelve episodes, 12. Plus there's an OVA episode (original video animation). The series follows Aoba Seragaki. It's an anime based off of the visual novel game Dramatical Murder and Dramatical Murder: ReConnect. The game is a yaoi series. If you DON'T like gay couplings then don't watch the play-throughs on youtube, and don't watch the OVA episode. The rest of the series is extremely mild on anything relationship aside from one moment where a couple characters kiss. (I won't spoil who for those who haven't watched it yet.) All in all, it's one of my favorite series just from having watched the games on youtube (I have yet to own either) and Sentai did a really good job on animating this series (at least by MY standards. Some people don't care for it.) ENJOY! :D",1469750400,6,1283,4.506437768240343

8725957,2,B012C89J0O,"I'm glad I had low expectations for this when I went into it or else I would have been extraordinarily disappointed.
DRAMAtical Murder is an anime based on a popular BL game, but trying to squeeze the whole thing into 12 episodes just didn't work and it had some really strange side effects. And by strange, I mean disappearing food with absolutely no explanation as to where it went when a character has their arms full of it in one scene and in the very next a fight breaks out and the food does a disappearing act ... like it went into an alternate dimension or something ... never to be seen again ... -_-' (I still have trouble getting over that! I mean, where the hell did it go?! o. O"") Also, according to a friend of mine, granny had teleporting shoes (I didn't really notice this but I take him at his word, cause ya ... I wouldn't be surprised by that at all ...). The issues with the animation were the unexplained things like that and the instances where things came off as ... stiff. The animation just wasn't as fluid as it could have been. Also, the soundtrack wasn't my favorite. Most of the OST consisted of electronic, techy sounding music that I just didn't care for. Though I do admit that some of the ever changing ED's were actually rather nice. Finally, the characters were iffy. I liked some of them and a few even had decent character development but, not much. Too many characters were squeezed into these twelve episodes and I just couldn't get attached to them.

Overall, DRAMAtical Murder wasn't all that great. It was decent, I suppose, but most would just call it a waste of time (and not even a good waste of time, it was meh).",1488758400,,1659,4.403908794788274
8725958,4,B012C89J0O,"Great anime! Unfortunately Aoba's gruntings and his constant use of the word ""ok"" in the English dub is so annoying! I kinda wish they had chosen someone else instead of Greg Ayres (voice of shion from NO.6 and gareki from Karneval) to voice clear but its not horrible. My suggestion is to watch it in Japanese rather than English if you don't like the dub. I don't dislike the English version because to be honest Aoba calling koujaku a ""selfish bitch"" in English is just priceless. :P",1484611200,,486,4.597701149425287
