8410082,5,B000UCH6YG,"First Blame the Record Companies. They use Various technical Schemes to Prevent buyers from having free choice.
USA is region 1 coded DVD,  Australia is Region 4 coded DVD.  This control is only about the money.

This Slim Dusty Concert is a 1st rate performance by Slim and the traveling Country Band.  This concert is as good or
better than anything coming out of Nashville or Austin. (I was born In Austin, Texas).  I have had some expose to Live Shows in Austin for 30 or 40 years. This Concert performance is:  5 Stars

The bad news the Recording company has not produced a USA Compatible DVD for you and I.  The work around is to Get a Computer friend to configure your computer to play it. Lots of computers DVD drives come ""region"" Free or Region ""0"" and they will play most any DVD. You can also buy Region Free stand alone DVD Players.  Home Theater Computers can also be configured to Play these ""Non USA DVD's.""  DO NOT MAKE Illegal copies. Purchase DVD's and CD's, Pay the Artist for his / her work!",1295827200,,1012,4.421621621621622
