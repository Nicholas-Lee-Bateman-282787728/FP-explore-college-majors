3163804,5,B0016QNSGA,"I just saw the commercial for this DVD and yelled so loudly that my husband was concerned.  I've been waiting for this show to reach DVD and finally it's here.  McG has an exciting and fabulous way of putting together a show that is so much fun to watch.  Don't expect any Emmy-worthy performances, because this show wasn't about that.  It was about being cool, living fast, and doing whatever it takes to get the bad guys.  The Candy Store rocks!",1214784000,,447,4.469135802469136
3163805,5,B0016QNSGA,"On behalf of thousands of frustrated Fastlane fans, I want to express my joy in learning of this show's impending release.  For too long, we waited while lesser TV shows were released, many of which will not survive time's scrutiny.  But Fastlane will endure for many reasons - it's gratifying that this series, which had one glorious year on television and several in syndication, will finally be given the treatment it deserves.  Whether it was the numerous visual standards it established, or the intriguing characters dreamed up by McG, Fastlane was a wild ride that demanded your attention and made you feel cool and hip after watching it.  This show can never be repeated, but it's my hope that mainstream viewers will give this show another chance.  While its death was premature, we now collectively celebrate its release.  Long live the birth of cool!",1211587200,2,860,4.9375
3163806,2,B0016QNSGA,"Co-created by Charlie's Angels helmer McG, Fastlane may very well be the flashiest action series to hit prime time television, well, maybe ever.  Peter Facinelli and Bill Bellamy star as Van and Deaq respectively, two rogue cops who team up under the supervision of their handler Billie (Tiffani Thiessen) to bring down the bad guys in a variety of flashy action, chase, and stunt sequences.  However, with all the gloss and beautiful people around, there really isn't much room for such things as character development or a coherent plot either.  Facinelli and Bellamy, as much as one may want to like them, just come off as cardboard cut-outs, as a majority of the acting to be found on Fastlane is just bad.  There are some interesting moments to be found though, including the arrival of Van's con-man father (Robert Forster), and Jay Mohr as an overseer who yearns to shut everything down.  Things really start to heat up and get good towards the end of the series however, as Van and Deaq are led on a wild goose chase, but the series ended up being canceled thanks to the large production costs for each episode, so things don't get wrapped up.  All in all, there really isn't anything to Fastlane underneath all the shiny gloss, but the show never really got the opportunity to grow into something worthwhile either before getting canned.  Fans of the series will surely eat this DVD set up, all others won't be missing too much.",1209340800,4,1437,4.724
3163807,5,B0016QNSGA,"I am soo glad this is finally coming to DVD. I watched and recorded every single episode on FOX. I didn't always have my entire video collection with me because I moved around. I watched the show on TV whenever I could on MTV, Spike, G4, and TVONE, etc. This show is smart, sexy, and funny. Van, Deaq, and Billie are the best team. I was soo upset when this show didn't get renewed for a second season or even get a proper send-off. I love this show and can not wait for its release. Buy this DVD and you won't regret it!",1208908800,,521,4.067961165048544
3163808,4,B0016QNSGA,This was one of my favorite shows when it was on. It should be rated at 5 stars but I'm only going to give it 4 stars because of the way they ended it. They could have at least made one more episode to finish it up! I was really hoping they would finish it up in the DVD set but doesn't look like it.,1208217600,4,300,3.6307692307692307
3163809,5,B0016QNSGA,"I am so excited that this show is FINALLY coming to dvd. I watched every episode that FOX aired and loved all of them This show is like one big action movie every single episode. It's got a great cast. Fun stories. Great guest stars. It's got everything. I'm guessing part of the reason FOX canceled it so fast, besides ratings, was the cost of production. It had to be expensive, but the final product was definitely worth it.",1207180800,3,427,4.417721518987341
3163810,5,B0016QNSGA,Watching old episodes of Fastlane on the net I became hooked on the show easily. The visuals look like a big budget action which is considerable since the pliot cost 30 millon to make. Bill Bellamly and Peter Fanchilli have good chemristiy and the show seems like it's gonna some cool storylines. Tiffani Thissen who plays the fellas boss is still sexier than all hell and McG directed this plot in the vein of Charlies Angels his debut film. The opening action sequence had nice visuals and good cinematography. Fiannly the show has another sexy chick in the form of Jennifer Skye.,1207094400,7,582,4.715686274509804

3163835,4,B0016QNSGA,"I did not purchase it on Amazon.com but am writing a review anyway due to the important subject a LOT of others are writing about. I have collected ""stuff"" for most of my whole life of 44 years and see a bad trend now from media companies in that they use copyright laws written by some stupid, greedy idiot(s) that do not realize that they are hurting the industry. This show was AWESOME when it was on TV. This was The Fast & the Furious made for TV! Tiffany Thiesen(I hope I spelled that right!) is so smokin' hot on this show! What was I talking about in the first couple of sentences? THEY REMOVED THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK(s). STUPID MOVE. VERY STUUUUUUUUUUUUPIIIIIIIIIIID MOOOOOOOOVE! Without the awesome songs on movies like Fast & Furious, the movie itself would still be excellent but just plain not as exciting. I gave this item 4 stars for it being an awesome, well made show that will remind you of the Fast & Furious movies. Why not 5 stars? Go back a couple of sentences.  Pure filthy rotten greed on the part of some overrated jerks that cost all of us an excellent soundtrack/set of music. Booker is another show I have on DVD that did the exact same thing. They took the Billy Idol songs off it and replaced them with some idiot they probably got at a local bar. There was a famous song still joked about to this day in country music from Johnny Paycheck called ""Take this Job and Shove It."" To the people in charge of these ridiculous removals of good music on movies and TV because some millionaire musician does not get more royalties and they complain about it like the greedy, petty, spoiled brats that they are, you can take your book of laws on copyrights and SHOVE!...IT!",1419984000,,1695,4.467741935483871

3163845,3,B0016QNSGA,"Even though I had burned copies of this series I wanted the packaging that a boxset offers. Everything was good to go until I watched the pilot episode. The music was a big part of this show and it is different in this boxset. The pilot episode originally had Deq and Van talking in a movie theater and at the end of  that scene Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" starts to play but in this boxset a different song comes on. Happens in another scene also. I have to assume for copyright issues this is why. I wish I would have known. I'm hoping that perhaps it is just with the pilot but that's probably just wishful thinking. Everything else about the order was great.",1378252800,,668,4.301587301587301

3163853,5,B0016QNSGA,"Okay, first let me explain my heading. Nearly everyone who gave 'Fastlane: The Complete Series' low ratings did so by whining that all the original music from show isn't on the DVD, which is true. However, Fastlane only lasted one season and didn't exactly get good ratings, so as a huge fan of the show I am just glad it was released at all! Honestly, if you love the show like I do who cares if some of the music was cut?? Granted the music adds some edge to it, but it's an incredible show with or without the music. So, if your a fan pick it up.",1358726400,2,549,4.092592592592593

When I received the package, it was packaged well. I opened it and pulled open the wrapper only to find that the insert label was all wavy like water had gotten to it. When I took a look at the discs, I was irritated to find a few minor scratches and smudges. This obviously was repackaged.

Beyond the superficial stuff, the show is great, loved it when it was on back in the day, and I'm glad I have it on DVD now. I will say though that some scenes are really grainy and pixelated. Sound could be a bit better. But at least you get a lot of bonus content and get one helluva show.",1340064000,,713,3.951388888888889

- this is a very nice action TV serie

- really nice hot girls (in sexy outfits)
- good sense of humor
- nice cars and bikes

The bad (sad) thing about this item:
- why some dvd versions of a lot of TV shows must have poor video quality? This TV serie deserves better video quality. Audio is ok, overall. Letter box format is also ok (I prefer widescreen). But the image quality... That's why I give 4 stars to this DVD Box.

3163866,3,B0016QNSGA,"So far the show has been really good to watch.  I will not even complain about the soundtrack being changed.  But what I dislike about this DVD set is the Quality Control.  Lets start off with the subtitles.  I do not mind that you have to select languages to get to the subtitles but considering when this show aired, it should have automatically been set to CC standards.  This made me wonder if other problems existed with this DVD set.  And they do.  The color Red bleeds through on several scenes.  In the Pilot episode the red is so bright, it almost completely blocks out the Van's head when he is next to the Red mustang racing car.  There are also other scenes where I noticed the same thing happens.

I am use to problems occurring in Mill Creek productions, but this DVD was manufactured by Warner Brothers.  It makes me wonder if Mill creek is becoming better at their Quality Control than Warner Brothers.  If the soundtrack being altered or the over exposed Red does not bother you, than this DVD is for you.  But If it does than stay away from this product.",1279065600,,1072,4.435897435897436

3163870,5,B0016QNSGA,"Let me start off by saying, 1, i'm a big fan of the show since i saw it the first time on G4TV, and 2, yes the music has been changed due to Warner Brothers, the company that put out the dvd, not being able to get the rights to the original songs used in the show, with that being said, Fastlane is still as awesome as it was when it first aired. Spanning 6 disks,you get all 22 episodes plus extras such as bloopers. For those who don't know, Fastlane is about 2 undercover cops who, as they say, act ""49% cop, 51% thug"" which means they carry no cop ID, the only thing they bring is their wit, money, rides and guns. The concept of the show is very generic but it works for the show and all the actors pull off their rolls well and are quite funny in most episodes, and the amount of stunts and special effects makes it feel like you are watching an hour long movie. If you loved the show or are looking for a good, action packed cop show, you must pick this up, even though the music is different, it's still an awesome show and the music difference is very minor. If you're going to let some minor music differences push you away from buying this show, then there might be something wrong with you.",1261008000,,1202,4.1191489361702125

The integrity of the show is totally diminished with the original music taken out.  I know that other reviews have pointed this out, but it is true. And the fact that it's not offered in widescreen would make someone just take the darn set and throw it against the wall.

Warner Bros. knew that saving money on both counts would be enough for the audience new to the show.  Warner Bros. knew what they were doing. Hard time fans of the show would be upset, but it wouldn't effect sales too badly.  The fact that the (and i don't know for sure, but i venture to guess) men in white suits thought this one up, is really tacky and cheap.

Maybe they will remaster the set with enough complaints.",1249430400,3,924,4.470238095238095

This DVD is, to put it simply, bad. I blame it on the writers, though, because the acting IS good, but what they are forced to be acting is TERRIBLE. The dialogue is really lame and awkwardly placed at points, the plots are ridiculous and the character development was extremely rushed and really odd. Peter's character, Van Ray, seriously falls in love with every girl in almost every episode after knowing her for one day...it gets really old.

*Loads of great action scenes; probably the most I've seen in any show.
*Excellent filming style.  Lots of fluid slow-motion, unique camera angles, and colorful settings.
*Loads of really cool cars.
*Loads of sex appeal.
*Excellent use of the settings (Los Angeles).
*Good collection of exciting, mesmerising stories.
*Good cast of characters.  Good acting, dialogue, and writing.

The Bad Things
*Ummm...

The Questionable Things
*The music is different than what was originally aired (I don't mind, since I never saw it broadcasted, but others seem to hate it).

This show resembles ""Charlie's Angels"" without the goofiness, and a heavier dose of the ""Fast and the Furious."" It has a lot of great action scenes, a lot of style, and good comprehensable stories.  The love/hate relationships between the main characters add even more flare.  Altogether, a high-quality show that is never dull.

The DVD set ranges from having good video quality to being grainy or fuzzy.  The audio sounds good.  Discs are in fullscreen only (I don't know if this show was ever done in widescreen).  There are some deleted scenes, outtakes, and a few featurettes.",1216425600,,1162,5.127659574468085

I am sure that this is a show that could have achieved cult status on DVD if properly produced and marketed.  Hopefully the fan reaction will send the message and a new set will come out that is worthy of this great show.",1216252800,12,563,4.636363636363637

Now, this might not seem like a big deal, but it totally changed the tone of the show. In the pilot, where a Chris Isaak or Phil Collins song added drama and emotion to the scene, has now been removed and replaced with some no name artist and song. This really does mess up the whole mood of the show. On top of that, this dvd is FULLSCREEN, isn't that odd since it was filmed in widescreen? A large part of the screen is cut off due to this reformat of the show. If you do not have all episodes recorded from when it originally aired, this is the best you are going to get.

3163896,1,B0016QNSGA,"First let me say that I am a huge fan of Fastlane.  I signed all the silly petitions to bring it back on air, to bring it to DVD, and so on.  If I knew what they were going to do to the show for the DVD release, I would've kept my mouth shut.

First and foremost, the DVD release does not contain the same music as the aired series.  Let that sink in.

So in the pilot episode, you aren't treated to The Vines, Limp Bizkit, and N.E.R.D. as you were on television, but rather some nameless hack band spouting generic platitudes about being ""hip"".  This is ironic, considering the point of the show is to be bombastic and authentic.  Instead we get the audio equivalent of ""white socks and a Corolla,"" to quote the show.  They don't even have the theme song for the opening credits.

Even worse, the DVD isn't widescreen.  This would be fine if the show was originally aired fullscreen.  But it was aired in widescreen.  This is baffling.  I get the music thing; it takes money to re-license tracks.  But why not widescreen?

The show would get a 5-star rating, but the poor quality of the DVD is what gets 1 star.  It's sad when the pirated version of the show that fans have been keeping on their hard drives for all these years is of superior quality to the trash I just paid money for.  Get your act together, Warner Brothers.",1215561600,103,1328,4.290322580645161
3163897,4,B0016QNSGA,"What do you get when you mix speed, violence, righteous babes and top it off with a rockus soundtrack? Fastlane. It's Miami Vice for the new millenium. Ok, it's fairly shallow, mindless and occasionally cheesy, but it's definitely fun, exciting and entertaining. Oh yea, they blow the everloving hell out of everything and smash up some of the prettiest rides you wish you could own. It won and Emmy for its action sequences, proabaly to be expected when you're spending $2.6 million an episode.

[Soundtrack Note]After 5 years of silence from the show's studio, Warner Brothers finally released the series to DVD this past Tuesday. Why'd it take so long? Most stories lead back to the expansive soundtrack featured throughout the Fastlane series. The problem seems to have been that many of the songs were originally licensed only for television and not a DVD release; as such, the series has jumped over to disc shy of nearly every single one of its original songs (thumbs down). Unfortunate, yes, but the new soundtrack has been reworked with a slight attention to the mood layed out by the original songs. That said, you can't take out a Coldplay or Phil Collins song from a dramatic scene and shovel in some unheard of tune. Half the reason this show was worth watching was simply for it's endless barage of hit tracks.

Video Quality: The Fastlane DVD set looks good, but there is some noticeable grain in each episode. The grain was perhaps a decision by the series' writer/director/producer, McG. Colors are vibrant, intense and saturate well.  Resolution is hit or miss at times, but acceptable for the most part, especially when viewed with an upconverting player. Overall, the five year old series has a respectable transfer, but not great.

Audio Quality: Alas, it's 2.0 Stereo.  For the most part, songs tend to be the focus of the audio mix and often overpower effects such as car engines and shootouts.  Use a receiver with pro-logic II, Neo:6 or any mode that will matrix 2.0 into 5.1 or more, ramp the bass up a bit and you won't be missing much.

Verdict: Likely a buy for just the fans.  The total change in the series soundtrack is definitely heartbreaking.",1215561600,12,2177,4.802139037433155
3163898,3,B0016QNSGA,"On the DVD release, most of the hot songs that were in the broadcast versions have been replaced by generic music (including the original theme song done by Snoop Dogg).  I presume this was done because licensing the original music for the DVD release would have been too expensive, but it's a real disappointment, since in addition to the high-production-value ""look"" of the show, the soundtrack was an integral part of making this show such Bruckheimer-esque lowbrow fun.",1215475200,10,473,5.064102564102564

The over-hyped action was something lacking on television, and the huge budget ended up being the show's undoing.  Anyway, the three major leads were expertly cast, as well as some excellent guest stars from time to time.  My only gripe is the cliffhanger that ended the show, we'll never see the resolution.

But Fastlane will endure for many reasons - it's gratifying that this series, which had one glorious year on television and several in syndication, will finally be given the treatment it deserves.  Whether it was the numerous visual standards it established, or the intriguing characters dreamed up by McG, Fastlane was a wild ride that demanded your attention and made you feel cool and hip after watching it.

3398303,2,B0016QNSGA,"Co-created by Charlie's Angels helmer McG, Fastlane may very well be the flashiest action series to hit prime time television, well, maybe ever.  Peter Facinelli and Bill Bellamy star as Van and Deaq respectively, two rogue cops who team up under the supervision of their handler Billie (Tiffani Thiessen) to bring down the bad guys in a variety of flashy action, chase, and stunt sequences.  However, with all the gloss and beautiful people around, there really isn't much room for such things as character development or a coherent plot either.  Facinelli and Bellamy, as much as one may want to like them, just come off as cardboard cut-outs, as a majority of the acting to be found on Fastlane is just bad.  There are some interesting moments to be found though, including the arrival of Van's con-man father (Robert Forster), and Jay Mohr as an overseer who yearns to shut everything down.  Things really start to heat up and get good towards the end of the series however, as Van and Deaq are led on a wild goose chase, but the series ended up being canceled thanks to the large production costs for each episode, so things don't get wrapped up.  All in all, there really isn't anything to Fastlane underneath all the shiny gloss, but the show never really got the opportunity to grow into something worthwhile either before getting canned.

The pilot episode originally had Deq and Van talking in a movie theater and at the end of  that scene Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" starts to play but in this boxset a different song comes on. Happens in another scene also. I have to assume for copyright issues this is why. I wish I would have known.

Beyond the superficial stuff, the show is great, loved it when it was on back in the day, and I'm glad I have it on DVD now. I will say though that some scenes are really grainy and pixelated.

Lets start off with the subtitles.  I do not mind that you have to select languages to get to the subtitles but considering when this show aired, it should have automatically been set to CC standards.  This made me wonder if other problems existed with this DVD set.  And they do.  The color Red bleeds through on several scenes.  In the Pilot episode the red is so bright, it almost completely blocks out the Van's head when he is next to the Red mustang racing car.  There are also other scenes where I noticed the same thing happens.

I am use to problems occurring in Mill Creek productions, but this DVD was manufactured by Warner Brothers.  It makes me wonder if Mill creek is becoming better at their Quality Control than Warner Brothers.  If the soundtrack being altered or the over exposed Red does not bother you, than this DVD is for you.  But If it does than stay away from this product.",1279065600,,1072,4.435897435897436

3398367,5,B0016QNSGA,"Let me start off by saying, 1, i'm a big fan of the show since i saw it the first time on G4TV, and 2, yes the music has been changed due to Warner Brothers, the company that put out the dvd, not being able to get the rights to the original songs used in the show, with that being said, Fastlane is still as awesome as it was when it first aired. Spanning 6 disks,you get all 22 episodes plus extras such as bloopers. For those who don't know, Fastlane is about 2 undercover cops who, as they say, act ""49% cop, 51% thug"" which means they carry no cop ID, the only thing they bring is their wit, money, rides and guns. The concept of the show is very generic but it works for the show and all the actors pull off their rolls well and are quite funny in most episodes, and the amount of stunts and special effects makes it feel like you are watching an hour long movie. If you loved the show or are looking for a good, action packed cop show, you must pick this up, even though the music is different, it's still an awesome show and the music difference is very minor.

The integrity of the show is totally diminished with the original music taken out.  I know that other reviews have pointed this out, but it is true. And the fact that it's not offered in widescreen would make someone just take the darn set and throw it against the wall.

Warner Bros. knew that saving money on both counts would be enough for the audience new to the show.  Warner Bros. knew what they were doing. Hard time fans of the show would be upset, but it wouldn't effect sales too badly.  The fact that the (and i don't know for sure, but i venture to guess) men in white suits thought this one up, is really tacky and cheap.

This DVD is, to put it simply, bad. I blame it on the writers, though, because the acting IS good, but what they are forced to be acting is TERRIBLE. The dialogue is really lame and awkwardly placed at points, the plots are ridiculous and the character development was extremely rushed and really odd.

The saddest part was Fox's choice of putting it on Friday slaughter night and leaving the Series Finale as a Cliffhanger. Even MTV loved it airing the first few episodes.

FASTLANE was action packed, fun, and very slick. McG did a great job. Episodes such as ""Strap On"" with Tiffani Thiessen & Jamie Pressley making out is unforgettable.

I do wish that the format was at least in widescreen, it's hard to believe that is wasn't filmed in 16:9 aspect ratio.  The sound mixing not being in surround sound is also odd, for as complex as I'm sure the production was of the show.

*Loads of great action scenes; probably the most I've seen in any show.
*Excellent filming style.  Lots of fluid slow-motion, unique camera angles, and colorful settings.
*Loads of really cool cars.
*Loads of sex appeal.
*Excellent use of the settings (Los Angeles).
*Good collection of exciting, mesmerising stories.
*Good cast of characters.  Good acting, dialogue, and writing.

The Bad Things
*Ummm...

The Questionable Things
*The music is different than what was originally aired (I don't mind, since I never saw it broadcasted, but others seem to hate it).

This show resembles ""Charlie's Angels"" without the goofiness, and a heavier dose of the ""Fast and the Furious."" It has a lot of great action scenes, a lot of style, and good comprehensable stories.  The love/hate relationships between the main characters add even more flare.  Altogether, a high-quality show that is never dull.

The DVD set ranges from having good video quality to being grainy or fuzzy.  The audio sounds good.  Discs are in fullscreen only (I don't know if this show was ever done in widescreen).  There are some deleted scenes, outtakes, and a few featurettes.",1216425600,,1162,5.127659574468085

This really does mess up the whole mood of the show. On top of that, this dvd is FULLSCREEN, isn't that odd since it was filmed in widescreen? A large part of the screen is cut off due to this reformat of the show. If you do not have all episodes recorded from when it originally aired, this is the best you are going to get. Buy this set if you don't have the originals archived somewhere, this is a great show. It's just too bad they could not have given us the full package on this dvd set. I give this dvd set 3 stars and the show itself 5 stars.",1215561600,13,925,4.032608695652174
3398392,1,B0016QNSGA,"DO NOT BUY THIS! Warner Brothers is asking you to buy six discs of a series that is missing ALL of the best music. Sure, this happens a lot, but come on. For Fastlane, the music was one of the main characters. Do not get tempted to buy an inadequate version. I just returned my copy! The set would have gotten NO STARS, but the system made me enter one.",1215561600,59,353,4.057142857142857
3398393,1,B0016QNSGA,"First let me say that I am a huge fan of Fastlane.  I signed all the silly petitions to bring it back on air, to bring it to DVD, and so on.  If I knew what they were going to do to the show for the DVD release, I would've kept my mouth shut.

First and foremost, the DVD release does not contain the same music as the aired series.  Let that sink in.

So in the pilot episode, you aren't treated to The Vines, Limp Bizkit, and N.E.R.D. as you were on television, but rather some nameless hack band spouting generic platitudes about being ""hip"".  This is ironic, considering the point of the show is to be bombastic and authentic.  Instead we get the audio equivalent of ""white socks and a Corolla,"" to quote the show.  They don't even have the theme song for the opening credits.

Even worse, the DVD isn't widescreen.  This would be fine if the show was originally aired fullscreen.  But it was aired in widescreen.  This is baffling.  I get the music thing; it takes money to re-license tracks.  But why not widescreen?

The show would get a 5-star rating, but the poor quality of the DVD is what gets 1 star.  It's sad when the pirated version of the show that fans have been keeping on their hard drives for all these years is of superior quality to the trash I just paid money for.  Get your act together, Warner Brothers.",1215561600,103,1328,4.290322580645161
3398394,4,B0016QNSGA,"What do you get when you mix speed, violence, righteous babes and top it off with a rockus soundtrack? Fastlane. It's Miami Vice for the new millenium. Ok, it's fairly shallow, mindless and occasionally cheesy, but it's definitely fun, exciting and entertaining. Oh yea, they blow the everloving hell out of everything and smash up some of the prettiest rides you wish you could own. It won and Emmy for its action sequences, proabaly to be expected when you're spending $2.6 million an episode.

[Soundtrack Note]After 5 years of silence from the show's studio, Warner Brothers finally released the series to DVD this past Tuesday. Why'd it take so long? Most stories lead back to the expansive soundtrack featured throughout the Fastlane series. The problem seems to have been that many of the songs were originally licensed only for television and not a DVD release; as such, the series has jumped over to disc shy of nearly every single one of its original songs (thumbs down). Unfortunate, yes, but the new soundtrack has been reworked with a slight attention to the mood layed out by the original songs. That said, you can't take out a Coldplay or Phil Collins song from a dramatic scene and shovel in some unheard of tune. Half the reason this show was worth watching was simply for it's endless barage of hit tracks.

Video Quality: The Fastlane DVD set looks good, but there is some noticeable grain in each episode. The grain was perhaps a decision by the series' writer/director/producer, McG. Colors are vibrant, intense and saturate well.  Resolution is hit or miss at times, but acceptable for the most part, especially when viewed with an upconverting player. Overall, the five year old series has a respectable transfer, but not great.

Audio Quality: Alas, it's 2.0 Stereo.  For the most part, songs tend to be the focus of the audio mix and often overpower effects such as car engines and shootouts.  Use a receiver with pro-logic II, Neo:6 or any mode that will matrix 2.0 into 5.1 or more, ramp the bass up a bit and you won't be missing much.

Verdict: Likely a buy for just the fans.  The total change in the series soundtrack is definitely heartbreaking.",1215561600,12,2177,4.802139037433155
3398395,3,B0016QNSGA,"On the DVD release, most of the hot songs that were in the broadcast versions have been replaced by generic music (including the original theme song done by Snoop Dogg).  I presume this was done because licensing the original music for the DVD release would have been too expensive, but it's a real disappointment, since in addition to the high-production-value ""look"" of the show, the soundtrack was an integral part of making this show such Bruckheimer-esque lowbrow fun.",1215475200,10,473,5.064102564102564
3398396,3,B0016QNSGA,"Since most people on here seem to have ""come"" once they heard the show is on DVD have you all stopped and asked yourself if its uncut?
There was language edited in every broadcast. Also the violence was toned down. The MTV version was the worst. Anyone know if its the original theme song too? Not the snoop dogg version..the limp biscuit cut.
I mean before you all wet yourselves ask if this is the correct uncut version of the show.

3398397,5,B0016QNSGA,"I was in love with Fastlane ever since I heard McG was involved with it.  Take Charlie's Angels, minus the estrogen overload, and add some major car porn, and you have one of the best series of the 21st Century.  The over-hyped action was something lacking on television, and the huge budget ended up being the show's undoing.  Anyway, the three major leads were expertly cast, as well as some excellent guest stars from time to time.  My only gripe is the cliffhanger that ended the show, we'll never see the resolution.  In spite of this, don't miss Fastlane, as it's an underrated classic.",1214870400,,592,4.653846153846154

Unless you are like me and went to another company years ago and got the original tapings on disc, you will be out of luck because the music, just as in M.V., made it even better.  I only bought this because one of my other original discs was damaged, so i wanted to have the entire collection on disc.

8264109,2,B0016QNSGA,"I watched the show when it originally aired, and I enjoyed it. Good character arcs, lovely eye candy, and a great soundtrack.

If you buy the series, you aren't actually getting the experience of the show. Almost none of the important music stayed the same. It's jarring to watch. I eventually passed my box set to my brother, who was too young to watch it when it aired, and he gave it back to me complaining that it didn't make any sense - he couldn't get even get through the first few episodes because the tone didn't match the plot. That's how much music matters to the enjoyment of a show.

Most shows can get away with changes to the music, this show can't. This show's soundtrack was closer to 'Supernatural' than 'CSI' in relevance and connection.",1483920000,,756,4.510948905109489
