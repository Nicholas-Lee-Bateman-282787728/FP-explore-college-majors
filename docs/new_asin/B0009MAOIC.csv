2299772,5,B0009MAOIC,"The latest installment of one of the best anime series in the past couple of years advances through its compelling story.  The action is about to reach a fever pitch, and revelations will be discovered.

In Vol. 5, Ed and Alphonse Elric pay a visit to their old hometown for repairs after their first battle with Scar.  The aptly named Major Armstrong, appointed to watch over the brothers, accompanies them home.  After a rather unemotional reunion with their childhood friend Winry and her grandma and a visit to their mother's grave, the Elrics get put back together again and head for Central to seek more information about creating a genuine Philosopher's Stone.  What they discover there may change their course of action and their whole motivation for creating it.  Meanwhile, as Scar resumes his search for the Elrics, he encounters the Homunculi Lust and Gluttony and barely escapes with his life.  The military is also looking for Scar to bring him to justice for the murders he's committed.

During their detective work, Ed and Al come across a pair of assassins who seemingly have close ties to the brothers, and make a few new discoveries about themselves as they engage in fierce battle.

Confused yet?  Well, if you're here, I certainly hope you are at least familiar with the story leading up to this volume.  ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is well into its second season with this chapter (Episodes 17-20), and it is moving along at such an intriguing pace that I find myself marking Vol. 6's release date on my calendar.  This is one anime series that pulls no punches emotionally, and reaches its audience by one shocking plot device and/or twist after another.  The series, set in an unrevealed time period but teeming with technology and magic (in this case, two great tastes that go great together), does a wonderful job of grabbing hold of the viewer and keeping them locked in to every detail, character, and story element.  As the series progresses, you'll actually identify with Edward and Alphonse and their terrible plight.  You'll watch them grow and mature, and even feel for them as they come closer and get further away from the goal of their quest with each episode.  The entire supporting cast is chock full of memorable characters as well, especially the other State Alchemists (my personal fave being Alex Luis Armstrong at the moment).  At certain times, mostly during the beginning of the series, slapstick elements and humor even inject themselves beautifully into the mix.  At this point in the series, though, the story's taken a very serious turn, although every once in a while a poke at Ed's height (which happens at least once an episode) or Alchemist Hughes showing off pictures of his infant daughter breaks up the somberness.

Talk about a series that's got it all together.  Whether you're a fan of sci-fi or fantasy anime (or both), or you just want to watch a deep, intriguing story with incredible and memorable characters, this is the one.  The dubbing, usually one of the most critiqued elements in anime, is absolutely excellent: Al's and Ed's English voices, especially, capture their every emotion with expert precision.  I can't imagine the difficulty in voice-acting a 10-year-old boy without a body whose soul is trapped in a case of armor, but darn it, it's nailed here.  Top it all off with a rawking opening theme from J-pop legends L'arc-en-Ciel (""Ready, Steady, Go""), and you've got a winner for the ages.  The only minor aggravation I found with this volume, though, was in the way the DVD is set up:  FUNimation forces you to watch a 2   minute preview of the latest volume of (the albeit slick-looking) ""Samurai 7"" and a small blurb for another series before the menu even comes up.  (I've seen this on other discs before; don't know if this is a flaw, but if every copy's like that, it should be an extra on the disc rather than shoved down our collective throats at the beginning.)  Do not miss this series; if you haven't seen it up to now, back up and look for Vol. 1 this instant!  You won't regret it.",1129766400,8,4066,4.775393419170244
2299773,5,B0009MAOIC,"Wow, the more I see of this series, the more I love it. There have been many good parts before in the series, but these four episodes are where things really start picking up. You learn dark secrets and Ed and Al's loyalty to each other is tested. This DVD really allows the series to shine. I warn you though, the last episode on the DVD ends in a huge cliffhanger, leaving you howling for the next one!",1128816000,,404,4.1923076923076925
2299774,5,B0009MAOIC,"Well First off the show itself is great. The storyline never has a dull moment and its much diffrent then other animes. But now on to this This dvd in particular. It contains 4 episodes 17. house of the waiting family, 18. Marcoh's Notes, 19. the truth behind truths. These four episodes are great in my opinon. Will a good episode to start off on and a great suspensful one to end with. The quality of the dvd is great. There is also an audio comentary on the disc which is very funny! But its only for 1 episode. So yeah there you have it Fullmetal alchemist Vol. 5 The cost of living, hope this review helped!",1127865600,,612,4.239316239316239
2299775,5,B0009MAOIC,"First I'd like to begin by stating the obvious:  Fullmetal Alchemist is an amazing anime with wonderful, fleshed-out characters, deep and interesting relationships, great action, an intriguing plot, and because of all of this it's my all-around favorite anime.  The humor and drama are all well-executed, the world where the story takes place is engaging, there's plenty of mystery and intrigue, and it's easy to feel close to the characters.  Even if you're not the type of person who likes every anime under the sun (or maybe you don't tend to like anime at all), I still recommend checking this out, you won't be disappointed.

As for the disc Volume 5 itself, it contains four episodes (like all of the others), and the last episode of the disc is certainly enough of a cliffhanger to make the next disc's release seem all too far away.  Exciting stuff here.  Some mystery is brewing, along with a big revelation that I won't be revealing  :)

The extras on the DVD are pretty cool, my absolute favorite being the actors' commentary.  This is the only volume with any commentary up to this point.  It is hysterical and very entertaining, highly recommended!  Just make sure you've finished the disc without the commentary the first go around as otherwise there are some spoilers.  Again, excellent commentary!

My only complaint (as with all of the DVDs that have been released for this series) is that there is always a trailer/preview/advertisement preceding the main menu screen that cannot be skipped (at least, not without some cunning!).  However, it is well worth the wait because this series is absolutely captivating!  Don't miss out!",1126569600,,1647,4.9381818181818184

8063090,5,B0009MAOIC,"The previous volume of FMA left the Elric brothers in a less-than-hearty state, and had them journeying home to get some much needed rest and relaxations, as well as a replacement for Ed's destroyed auto-mail arm. This volume picks up with the boys' arrival in the tiny village they once called home. Accompanied by Armstrong, the brutishly gentle alchemist, the boys explore what they left behind. Later, with the repairs completed, the brothers continue their search for the work of Dr. Marcoh at Central's library. Only what they find isn't what they had hoped for, and Ed becomes more determined to seek out the Philosopher's Stone, leading him to what appears to be a prison where only the most dangerous criminals are. Once here, the brother's Elric face off against creatures very familiar, at least in concept, to Ed and Al.

Fullmetal Alchemist only continues to deepen, adding a few conflicts to the characters that make them more and more lovable, especially Alphonse, who faces a sad realization in this volume. Scar also has a few moments on this volume. But the greatest surprise in this volume is Armstrong. He had a small role in the previous volume, but he really becomes something special in this volume as Ed and Al's protector while in their vulnerable state.

I'm now completely sure that FMA ranks high up there as one of anime's greats, standing easily beside classics like Akira, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis Evangelion, all anime I hold in high regard. If you're reading this you've probably already found some interest in FMA, so I probably don't have to recommend this. But still, I have to, as FMA is quickly becoming something close to legendary in the anime world.",1151798400,3,1696,4.865051903114187
8063091,4,B0009MAOIC,"In this volume ed and al head back to where  they grew up and Ed has to get his arm once again fixed by winry. After he does ed and al decide to spar against eachother than armstrong decides to spar with them and they don't want that. Armstrong is with them because SCAR the so called serial killer wants to kill Ed and not so much al.

When Ed and Al are heading back to central to go to the library to read about Dr. marcos notes, the library is burnt and was destroyed the night before. What happened was SCAR whent into the library and found two of the homunculi who are not human at all,one lust and one gluttony. They fight lust drops a candle and the place burns and they fighting when the place crumbles.\

Al and ed find a girl who has a photographic memory and she gives them the version she wrote and ed and al find the ingrediant to make the stone it,ittttttt is live human beings in mass numbers.

They sneak at night and go to lab 5 the abanndoned lab where ed thinks the stone was being mad they go and get a surpise,Al gets a much bigger surprise than ed but not as hard.<.>--------0",1143244800,,1099,4.121495327102804
8063092,5,B0009MAOIC,"The 5th installment of the ultra-popular series has introduced Pinako and Winry yet again, as well as adding to the Philosiphers Stone mystery. Is there any end to the madness that this show gives you? You MUST buy this DVD if you are going to watch this series. However, do not expect much blood to come from the next DVD...but do expect many plot-twists.",1137196800,,356,4.578125
8063093,5,B0009MAOIC,"After a long but not intentional absence and some life-threatening adventures the Elric brothers along with the impressively strong but impressively vain Major Armstrong arrive back in the village of their birth. Their purpose for Ed to repair the arm that was crushed by Scar and for Al's armor to be reformed. They have to hurry because the answer to the secret of the Philosopher's Stone is finally within their reach as the two brothers secure Dr. Marcoh's notes about its formulation. But the question is whether the two boys are prepared to find out the cost of making it. And somewhere out there are Lust and Gluttony who seem to be manipulating the situation for their own ends, even if it means crossing the murderous Scar!

What's new about this show? It is simply excellent.  It's nice to see them coming to terms with their past and we have a bit more sympathy for Scar now that we know a bit more about his past. The villains are deftly drawn and mysterious without being annoyingly obscure. The quest for the Elrics to claim redemption continues on its always interesting path, which you can already sense will not result in all of their hopes being fulfilled.",1131580800,3,1174,4.694174757281553
