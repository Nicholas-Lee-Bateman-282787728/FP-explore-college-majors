8132299,5,B000GHK840,"This movie is about clash of cultures, and traditional values vs modern values. This movie does not take sides, and gives each it's due importance, as it deserves.

Movie is well made for it's time, and still is very watchable. It's music reflects Kashmir's music very well, and Shashi kapoor truly fits in as Kashmiri men, both by looks, and style.

A movie, well made, well received, entertaining, and worth watching.",1366675200,,419,4.887323943661972
