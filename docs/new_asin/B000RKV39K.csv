8201165,4,B000RKV39K,"I would give this a 5 star rating because the quality is superb for fans of this series. The fact that this disk is only 30 minutes really stinks! The is a BD-R format disk, and they only use about 20% of the space, so I have no idea why they only put one 30 minute episode on it.

If you don't mind paying for only 30 minutes of video, buy it because the audio and video quality is certainly there. I would buy more as a fan of the series, but 3 episodes on one disk would really open my wallet.",1205020800,,496,3.8627450980392157
