8566263,5,B00BCNMCSM,"I love Song Joong Ki, he is an amazing actor! This drama will have you on the edge of your seat wanting more. There's 5 discs all together in a perfectly packaged DVD case, and it arrived on time.",1490227200,2,196,4.051282051282051
8566264,5,B00BCNMCSM,"Excellent story and acting!  Kang Ma Ru is motivated to restore the innocent love in his heart and he does so by acting unselfishly toward those he loves.  His actions are often misunderstood.  This story is a moral journey of the highest caliber.  As a drama, it holds one in his seat from beginning to end.",1471046400,,308,4.446428571428571
8566265,5,B00BCNMCSM,The Poh Kim (PK) boxset version has excellent subtitles. Nice packaging as well.  Make sure you buy the version that is licensed and produced by PK.,1431648000,2,148,4.6923076923076925
8566266,4,B00BCNMCSM,"I have not purchased this. However, I have seen the complete drama. The male lead character was a heroic man, but not in the way you'd typically see a hero. He took the fall for the girl he loved. He later came to love a second girl. I liked this drama and thought it was very interesting because of the male lead character.",1388534400,3,324,4.158730158730159
8566267,2,B00BCNMCSM,"THIS was the Chinese version of the box set and subs are not so good.

The Korean boxes set is better quality and has excellent clear subtitles.  That is not the case with this version.  And when they send you the product they send it WITHOUT the labels to return it.  Will NOT buy from them again.",1366934400,12,298,4.175438596491228
