6200458,5,B00HRISNPM,"The new blu-ray release of THE SWIMMER should thrill  fans of the film and is a great way for newcomers to discover this 'arthouse' classic.

The print used is flawless and the transfer is excellent!

 Marvin Hamlisch's passionate score, though presented  in mono, sounds first rate. An isolated stereo music track, synced up to the film, is one of many terrific extras.

There are several docs about the making of the film. These contain many nuggets of choice behind-the-scenes info such as the revelation  that Burt Lancaster could not swim!
Unfortunately, the major creative forces that produced the film are no longer with us. Thus , some of the interviews come off as  a bit prosaic. The main interviewees are the first and second assistant directors who tell us , repeatedly, ""Lancaster was a total professional"". Not exactly earth shattering. A little trimming of these docs would have improved the overall viewing experience.

The film itself remains a powerful, haunting, and unique motion picture experience.

Check it out!

6200459,5,B00HRISNPM,"I was forced to read John Cheevers short story THE SWIMMER not once or twice, but several times between 7th grade and high school graduation. While that may be somewhat of a damning indictment of growing up in the 80s and early 90s (between that and the handful of Toni Morrison novels I was forced to endure, you can understand why kids today have no familiarity with classic literature), Cheevers story was an interesting read, and one that made for an equally fascinating 1968 film starring Burt Lancaster. The movie  a commercial failure that eventually gained a cult following  is now available on Blu-Ray from Grindhouse Releasing in a sensational package thats an early candidate for the years best.

swimmerThe Swimmer probes the fragmented psyche of a wealthy townie who swims from one pool to the next in a wealthy Connecticut suburb, gradually reliving his failed personal and professional life along the way. Lancaster stars as Ned Merrill, and gives a tremendous performance as a guy experiencing his past and re-experiencing his downfall, which is partially revealed in a series of mostly ambiguous run-ins with various neighbors. From his familys nubile babysitter (Janet Landgard) to his former mistress (Janice Rule), its clear something has happened to Neds job and (possibly) family, and yet director Frank Perry and screenwriter Eleanor Perry (the directors then-wife) do a remarkable job retaining enough of the mystery from Cheevers story so its never completely explained. Lancaster, meanwhile, is superb in a demanding role that ranges from a sexist, cheating, demeaning louse to a sympathetic loser whos fallen from grace (look also for Joan Rivers as a party guest Burt hits on late in the film!).

The Swimmer is a weird, poetic, powerful film from the late 60s  both a time capsule of its time and a vivid portrait of a upper-middle class man overly (and seemingly) swept up in the fast lane of life, who receives his comeuppance as the picture progresses. Its nearly like Ordinary People meets The Twilight Zone, though even that description doesnt quite capture the films offbeat eccentricities and its central theme, which is as valid today as ever.

Originally shot on-location in Connecticut, The Swimmer had a rocky post-production period, with an uncredited Sydney Pollack called in to re-shoot scenes involving, among others, Lancaster and Janice Rule. A handful of secondary roles were re-cast and re-shot in California, often obviously so, with Kim Hunter one of the new additions to the film (according to one of the casting sheets seen in the documentary, Billy Dee Williams originally played the chauffeur whom Lancaster insults).

Its possible that these alterations only added to the movies strange atmosphere and tone, but either way, the films legacy and its fascinating behind-the-scenes story have been captured in a spectacular Blu-Ray/DVD release from Grindhouse. Available March 25th, The Swimmer not only includes a phenomenally fresh, and DNR-free, 1080p transfer from the Sony vaults, but also a full isolated stereo track of Marvin Hamlischs memorable dramatic score (his first) and a bevy of extras.

Chief among them is an extensive, 2 hour documentary from Oscar-winning film editor Chris Innis. Though many of the principals have since passed, Innis managed to assemble Janet Landgard, Joan Rivers, editor Sidney Katz, Burts daughter Joanna Lancaster, and assistant directors Michael Hertzberg and Ted Zachary. All share their recollections of working on the film, particularly Lancasters generosity and his conflicts with Frank Perry, along with producer Sam Spielgels problems with the film in post-production. The latter lead to Frank Perry being fired and Pollack brought in at Lancasters insistence, along with Katz extensively recutting the picture. Though the Perrys were obviously unhappy with Spiegels actions, theres little that disappoints in the released version  and the fact that Frank Perry worked with editor Katz on subsequent projects indicates that perhaps the director was satisfied, at least somewhat, with how the picture turned out after all.

Also included in the documentary is a 2010 conversation with Marvin Hamlisch, who details his hiring on the film and eloquently sums up the movies pleasures, as well as Marge Champion, who can be seen in the films opening sequence. The elderly Champion also appears in a 2013 TCM screening interview conducted by filmmaker Allison Anders, likewise included here in the bonus features.

Grindhouse has also included unused footage shot for the movies opening credits, as well as stills from Barbara Lodens discarded scene in the role that Rule ultimately filled. This is also brought up in the documentary with the revelation that Lodens husband at the time, director Elia Kazan, conspired with Spiegel to have her sequence removed  going behind the backs of the Perrys, who thought Kazan was acting as an advocate for them.

Additional still galleries, full trailers and TV spots, a recording of Cheever reading his original story, and booklet notes from B-movie auteur Stuart Gordon and Innis make for a dynamite package thats my favorite release so far in 2014.

I'm not usually a Burt Lancaster fan, and his performance in this film may put off some viewers, but it may be the best performance he ever gave. I also love Janet Landgaard (whatever happened to her???) as the former babysitter who accompanies Lancaster on his journey.

6200461,5,B00HRISNPM,"I forget when I first watched this movie.  I wish it had been almost at the moment of my birth.  This is a simple story about a man, played impeccably by Burt Lancaster, who decides to swim home across his neighbors' swimming pools for no particular reason that we are aware of.  On the way he revisits his own flawed and failed past.  Failed career.  Failed relationships.  Failed marriage.  No, it's not his past.  It's the present.  No, wait, it's his future.  Burt is as baffled by them as I am.  Why is everyone so cruel and uncaring toward me?  Why could I have done to make them so harsh and unforgiving?  He can't remember.  He doesn't understand.  But it doesn't matter.  Nothing matters but swimming home.  Is he living in a timeless present where the past and the future do not exist?  This is a film you will not be able to forget.  It will make you reflect on your life like no other film I have ever known.  It is a film that I am afraid to watch and that I never want to end.  And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  It will crush you like a beer can.",1392422400,44,1060,4.164179104477612

I still remember how puzzling it was as it started, yet it was absolutely mesmerizing - and then it began to creep the hell out of me!  I'm SO glad it's being released as a DVD/Blu-ray Combo - now everyone can finally see what all the fuss is about.

6200466,5,B00HRISNPM,"I saw this movie for the first time with my college girlfriend in the late seventies on a snowy black and white TV at a home on the beach in Black Point CT:  It was an appropriate locale for the story of man who, while swimming upstream in an imaginary ""river"", is having his character revealed episode by episode as a man who is reliving his downward spiral, even to the point of tragedy.

I don't want to go into detail about the story, but suffice to say there is a lesson for us regarding our common propensity for self-deception. There's still a lot of man in ""Neddy"", but his obsessions and vices have wrought havoc on him and the story leaves us pondering his fate.  Very much a 70's movie.  If you're making an evening out of watching movies this would pair well with ""The Ice Storm"".
About the Blu-ray transfer:  I have an upscaling Blu-ray player and I honestly think there is only so much resolution you can fabricate from the Kodak 70mm film that was used at the time.  I don't see a great difference between the blu ray version and the upscaled DVD, so use touhat information however you like.",1480464000,,1106,4.397058823529412
6200467,5,B00HRISNPM,"Kind of like a modern American version of ""Wild Strawberries"", this is a poignant odyssey into the dark hollow underside of the American Dream, so understated that it creeps up on you with its full existential horror just when you least expect it. Burt Lancaster is quite moving in what has been called his best performance, alternately full of radiant hope and stark despair, an All-American hero drinking the dregs of his life; Janice Rule is phenomenally deep and tragically beautiful as an empty socialite; Janet Landgard is the epitome of fresh youthful innocence who cannot fathom the psychic ravages time wreaks on a man. The beginning is full of hope and possibility, the ending full of dark almost surrealistic despair befitting Albee. it' s more than a story of our times, it's the story of life itself.

6200469,5,B00HRISNPM,"I honestly don't know how I missed this release in 2014. I found out about it recently after re-watching and reviewing an old copy I had of Barbara Loden's Wanda. I was researching some Barbara Loden films and found a reference to the five-part documentary, The Story of The Swimmer, which is included as a special feature of this set. Barbara Loden was the first actor hired to play the part of Shirley Abbot in The Swimmer but then Janice Rule was recast after Loden's husband, Elia Kazan, allegedly retrieved the film and burned it. All that remains are photographic stills.

I owned the VHS of the Swimmer back in the 1980s, then the DVD when it came out. I never thought this would come out on Blue-Ray with all of the extra features (there are a lot). I also read the entire volume of The Stories of John Cheever and The Swimmer is in that volume (the special features include a recording of John Cheever reading The Swimmer  I just have to figure out how to get it onto my ipod). The adaptation, written by Eleanor Perry (Mrs. Frank Perry) is not exactly the way the story is written but it's a good representation of the story, overall, maybe even a little better in places with some of the additions (like the scene with Joan Rivers, which was written especially for Joan  they even named the character Joan). The Perrys made a number of films together  some of the most interesting art films ever made  Last Summer, David and Lisa, Diary of a Mad Housewife, The Swimmer, Ladybug Ladybug. Frank Perry also made Mommie Dearest  talk about cult film classics.

So, this features a beautiful print of the film in both DVD and Blue-Ray formats. Stunning. Even if you have an older DVD, the price of this is worth it for the extra features, which includes the documentary I mentioned above at a running time of about 2.5-hours long. The documentary is actually very impressive. Burt Lancaster's daughter, Joanna, appears along with some of the Assistant Directors, the swim coach, Marge Champion, and Joan Rivers and Janet Landgard, plus many others.

Sad for me was seeing Joan Rivers, who was one of the greats, talking about her role in the film and her experiences with the Perrys and Burt Lancaster. In this documentary, Joan is speaking with an extremely raspy voice, which was the reason, I believe, she was seeing the doctors when she died (or they allegedly killed her). So this was filmed just before her death (she died in 2014).

There are a lot of interesting details in the documentary about Barbara Loden and in the special features, the production stills of Loden and Lancaster in this are included to click through. Also, I never knew that John Cheever appeared in the film as a drunk in a pool. Nor did I know that Lancaster had really had a leg injury and they wrote his limp into the story so that he could limp freely. Frank Perry was fired as the director of the film near the end of production and some of the scenes were re-filmed, including those with Loden's replacement, Janet Rule, and a few other scenes under the directorship of Sidney Pollack.

If you don't know about the Cheever story or the film, it's the story of an upper middle class man (Burt Lancaster) named Ned Merrill, who mysteriously appears at an old friend's house clad in swim trunks claiming he will swim home via an imaginary river of pools  house to house, pool to pool. As the story opens, it seems like summer is in full bloom, but as he journeys from one pool to the next, the weather as well as the season seems to change along with the reception he receives from pool to pool. Each segment of the journey produces clues into the mystery of Ned's appearance and his river of pools until he reaches home and a dose of reality sets in. That's all I'll say about it for the people who haven't actually seen it yet.

This story really debunks some of the myths of the affluent in mid-century America (aka Connecticut and Westchester). And there are a lot of relevant moments for modern times.

This comes with the two discs, tons of extras and a 12-page  book of notes. Apparently a second, happy ending was filmed, according to the documentary, but it doesn't appear on this disc in the special features. Probably lost. But this is worth every penny. In fact, I would have paid more.

Highly recommend.",1477267200,,4307,4.5680933852140075

6200471,5,B00HRISNPM,"Burt Lancaster delivers one of his greatest performances, on the scale of his work in The Rainmaker with Katharine Hepburn. Here he swims through Fairfield County Conn. and the sharks he encounters embody the world he lives in..deep at the surface only. And Lancaster's scenes of self-awareness are volcanic.

Watch for Joan Rivers in a cameo that is excellent, and Janice Rule..underrated actress giving us one of the most heartless performances of a suburban woman of means who has nothing left but her hatred. Not to be missed.

Wonderful release on Bluray.",1472169600,,560,5.076086956521739
6200472,5,B00HRISNPM,"This is a relatively obscure film adapted from a John Cheever story.  I caught it a while back late at night on a movie channel.  Although its as old as I am I had never heard of it before.  I cant fathom why because watching this was one of most memorable movie experiences of my life and I say that without hyperbole.

The story concerns a man who looks out across a valley and upon seeing the swimming pools dotting the landscape realizes that he can swim back to his house on the other side of the valley by going from pool to pool and taking a dive.  As he swims each pool he encounters the various owners who all seem to know him though some haven't seen him in years.  From the dialog we gradually get a picture of his life.  Theres a slightly surreal quality that keeps you guessing about whether what you are seeing is really happening or is perhaps a dream.  And as it progresses a mounting sense of dread sets in as you begin to suspect something is very wrong.  The climax issimplyunforgettable.  One of the most powerful movie moments I have ever seen.

Apparently of all the movies Burt Lancaster made this was his personal favorite.  He even invested a significant amount of his own money to film an extra scene that he felt was necessary (and I agree with him about that) after disinterested studio execs wanted to limit their financial exposure and push what they had out there.

Absolutely fantastic.  One of my favorite movies of all time.

Btw: I read the Cheever story after seeing the film.  You can get it free online.  Its great.  The movie is even better!",1459555200,,1580,4.408304498269896

6200481,5,B00HRISNPM,"""The Swimmer"" by Grindhouse Releasing gets a well-deserved five stars for the transfer and the extras alone, but the film is still tough to watch, moderately acted, and a bit too oppressive in terms of its drippy music score; nonetheless, it is a fascinating curio in its own right. I honestly believe though that if Lancaster hadn't accepted this part that we probably wouldn't remember this picture at all. But Lancaster did accept the role, and now we have a spectacular new scan to revisit the film with (light years beyond the ratty print that THIS TV cable station has been using for their Sunday afternoon screenings of this title). Both director Perry and author Cheever (and the screenwriter Eleanor Perry) have cameos in the picture, so this is kind of a nice time capsule for that reason alone. SPOILERS!!! (Don't read further UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!!!) My theory is that Ned's daughters may have drown in a swimming pool and it may have been his responsibility and therefore he is suffering from a guilty conscience--there are many clues in the film that lead me to this conclusion, but I may be wrong about this. I believe Ned's wife is alive, but she left him after the death of his two daughters. Watching ""The Swimmer"" is a bit mysterious really, because the viewer has to be the detective to figure out exactly what is going on with the main character...but rest assured, the veneer cannot cover sins for long, and the revelations that occur between these characters are fascinating indeed. While the picture seems to comment upon the fractured nature of the American Dream during the Vietnam-era suburbs of hometown America, ""The Swimmer"" is both dated and timeless in that it certainly remains a product of its time but also transcends all time and peoples with its poignant story about what it means for a person to have true self worth in a society that only values money, competition, and promotion. In any case, I'm inclined to say that I like this film more than THE GRADUATE, and that is due in no small part to Lancaster's intense performance (which does have a lot of subtle qualities about it). I'm not entirely sure that we can take Ned as a ""reliable"" narrator, but the resulting drama is tragic even if you don't feel you have all of the pieces to create the appropriate picture. Certainly today--and not even then--no major studio would finance a risky picture such as this one, but in the end it emerges as an enthralling (yet painful) portrait of one man's inconsistency in becoming himself, a man who carries an albatross around his neck constantly--showing that his problems are more than simply monetary.
A must-see film (though a bit of an endurance test nevertheless) is the ""Story of The Swimmer"" documentary included upon this Grindhouse Releasing set, a picture that takes you through every backstroke that it took to pull off this seemingly small movie miracle. Sadly, there does not appear to be any footage left from Frank Perry's original cut of this film. What we have now is many of the scenes that Sydney Pollack re-shot because of Sam Spiegel's nervous indigestion concerning a novice director like Perry (the beautiful Barbara Loden was initially filmed for her scenes, but Pollack instead shot the redux with the equally exciting Janice Rule in her place). If Grindhouse could have found some of Perry's original footage, what a monumental cut we could have seen put together here. Still, we have some still pics of what those original shoots looked like included here. THE SWIMMER may never have been intended to appeal to all audiences, but it certainly would have fared better if the post-production (and later distribution) would have been less chaotic and more confident in execution. One of the best features included here is an audio only recording of John Cheever reading ""The Swimmer"" short story. Cheever's delivery is droll and sometimes humorous, offering a good picture of the kind of unspeakable menace that lies beneath the dramatic foundation of suburban life. I thought that maybe THE SWIMMER would have awakened a desire in film producer's to attempt adapting more short stories to long form feature films, but then again not every screenwriter can do what Eleanor Perry did here (and sometimes literature doesn't always translate into film very well either). To my knowledge, THE SWIMMER never received a proper VHS release here in the States, and for this reason alone the picture has taken on a cult status that few other Lancaster films have achieved (if you missed it on cable, chances are you may never even have heard of this film). Certainly not a ""fun"" movie to watch, but a lot better than it could have been no doubt, and it does capture that elusive, melancholic feeling of true drama pictures that attempt painting a portrait of a specific time period and place.",1439942400,,4849,4.850422195416164
6200482,4,B00HRISNPM,"I showed this film to my film and literature class and was impressed by how much they enjoyed it. I enjoyed it too, and felt that it was still relevant to today. It adheres closely to John Cheever's story of the same title and was probably not a great commercial success because A) Cheever can be a surprisingly bizarre writer, who often focuses as much on a post-modern conceit as much as a character, and B) the film adheres to the rather mournful ending. Burt Lancaster is perfectly cast in the role as the handsome protagonist and is rather Don Draper-like in his ability to flirt with every single woman that comes across his path. It is certainly a product of its time, but the restoration fills the screen with sharp, vivid colors. There are a few scenes added to the story to flesh out the film, but they feel organic and appropriate and don't really do anything to detract from the essential core of the story and theme.",1439596800,,929,4.502958579881657

Lancaster certainly has sympathy for this ""social climber"" taking inventory of his life.  The goofy idea of walking around in a bathing suit ""swimming his way home"" through the pools of people he knows seems rather bland at first.  But gradually, you begin to wonder if these people are reacting to him on more than one level.  It's no coincidence that his trek begins among people he feels the most comfortable and respected around.

6200490,5,B00HRISNPM,"Burt Lancaster delivers a superb performance as Ned Merrill, a man who starts out by swimming all the neighbors' swimming pool, which altogether are the river Lucinda (named after his wife). At each pool, and some other places along the way, he meets more people and we learn more about him and hints that things are not quite as great as he seems to convey. There are a variety of ways to dissect this film. Is it a dream? Is he dead? Is it to be taken literally? There certainly are some intentionally 'dream-like' sequences, such as the walk and talk with Julie Hooper, the former babysitter, now all grown up and looking luminous. Slowly, we see him as a man who is broken down by events we never learn but can only surmise. The final scene is every bit as haunting as any film I've seen. The score by Marvin Hamlisch takes some getting used to. When I first heard it, I thought it was overdone but then I liked it more and more with each viewing. And this is a film you may want to watch more than once. There are so many scenes I love, that fascinate me.
The look of the film, on blu ray and dvd is astonishing. I had only seen it on what can only be called 'blurry' video by comparison. Here, the colors are vibrant and alive.  And it should be noted, the extras are on both the blu ray and dvd. There is also an option to listen to the score only.
Included in the extras is a documentary over 2 hours long that covers virtually every detail of the production. Very interesting. The only shame is that we do not get to hear, even in archived footage, from Burt Lancaster himself.
The artwork on the case is one of the best I've seen and includes a booklet. They really did a wonderful job with this release.
With all the extras, it is still the film itself that is the best reason to buy this. It is an underrated film that is unlike any film I've seen. My guess is that the audiences, and critics, were not ready for this film in 1968. Although to his credit, Roger Ebert gave is a glowing review, may he rest in peace.
How powerful a film is this? Even when I know what is going to happen, I will watch this film and as the ending approaches, I half hope that it won't end the way it does. And, even though he is a fictional character, I wonder what became of Ned Merrill.
This is the kind of film, and performance by Lancaster, that transcends such awards as the Oscars. It is a one of a kind masterpiece and unforgettable.",1424304000,8,2433,4.221030042918455

6200492,4,B00HRISNPM,"We bought this because I read about the commentary. The movie itself we already had from TCM.

This is one of my favorite films. I'd have given it five stars for the impeccable clarity of the picture, what a treat to see it even more beautifully! but the commentary has WAY more Joan Rivers than I could handle! I can't stand her and her part was so insignificant that I think the screen time they gave her for discussion is way out of proportion.

I realize they interviewed those who were still alive to talk about it, and as this movie was made in the 60s, it's not like they had the pick of the litter. I just fast forward over Rivers. I'd love to hear Mr. Lancaster himself speak about the film, but they at least had his daughter. Of course Janice Rule (see also her work in ""3 Women"" and ""Twilight Zone"") is no longer with us and I've never seen any interview footage of her.

Janet Landgard played the impossibly beautiful blonde nymphet and she's here to talk about it. She's aged really well, and still has that sparkle in her blue eyes. Her smile is still the same. Pretty eyes and a great smile go a long way in retaining good looks.

This is a flawed yet heartbreaking film. There are few cinematic treasures that I deem unforgettable and this is one of them. I also notice something different during each viewing. This is not a universally accessible ""date movie"" or ""family movie"" and certainly not a ""chick flick"". I've seen Burt Lancaster in numerous films from his black & white days and this is by far my favorite performance.

One scene I wish were cast differently is the one with Ms. Rule. She was a wonderful actress but I'd have preferred someone else in this part. It just didn't sit right with me. She overdid it I think. Apparently someone else was originally cast, then they reshot it with Rule, so I don't know if the previous actress was even less right for it.

The score is loud, overbearing, and especially early in the film, can really get in the way. I have gotten used to it by now and try to ignore it.

If you haven't seen The Swimmer, watch it with someone you love that you can hold onto, esp. at the ending. It's probably the most upsetting ending scene in any movie (and I've seen hundreds). That the filmmakers managed to do this without any gore, killings, or gratuitous profanity and keep it so beautiful is a testament to the true talents involved. Lancaster even paid out of his own pocket when the production ran out of money; that's how important it was to him.

It's not like any other film and seems to not make any sense but watch it several times and prepare to be emotionally involved. It is never explained exactly what happened, so you have to use your imagination, which was typical of films of this era. A much gentler movie than those of today but so much more impactful.",1422489600,3,2830,4.408045977011494

This is definitely an original topic for a movie, but the movie will
leave you with more questions than answers. Lancaster was an
unabashed liberal in his political views, although being a liberal
in the 50s and 60s is a little deferent than today, he was one of the
few big stars that marched with MLK which makes him alright with

6200519,5,B00HRISNPM,"Words can not express how delighted I am to own this new Blu Ray of ""The Swimmer"".  It is a major longtime favorite.  Knowing that it was a relatively low budget effort, I was not surprised when seeing all previous editions I have seen of the movie (and I have seen it many times) to find them looking a bit rough, faded, etc.  I had thought that the producers lacked the wherewithal to control the overall look of the production in the way that major studios usually did.  This new edition clears up that misconception.  Clearly, they achieved a lustrously beautiful picture, with vibrant color, good contrast, perfect sharpness and fine, clear audio.  It can now be seen as the beautiful movie that the crew who made it clearly worked very hard and skillfully to create.  In that respect, it is an eye-opener, and a joy.  I know, from personal experience, that the movie itself is not for everyone.  I find it poignant, deeply moving, and incredibly thought provoking, but it does not spoon-feed the viewer with all the answers that explain its amazing conclusion.  It is not static, or dry, but it is devoted entirely to depicting human drama, and powerful commentary on people's lifestyles.  It has none of the pulse-pounding action highlights to be found in so many of today's movies.  I have read that Burt Lancaster had initially been reluctant to take on the lead role.  I hope that he was glad to have changed his mind, as the work of this exceptional actor in this film may be the best he ever did.  If you favor engrossing, serious film-fare that will cause you to ponder what you have seen long afterward, this one should unquestionably be on your must-see list.",1399507200,8,1674,4.649659863945578

6200522,5,B00HRISNPM,"I never saw this film when it first came out in 1968, but I vividly recall seeing a trailer for it in the coming attractions prior to seeing another (now long forgotten) movie. It's strange that a mere trailer would stick with someone for more than 40 years, but the phrase ""I'm swimming home"" has haunted me all this time. I am so glad that I finally got a chance to see the movie itself.

I wonder if I would have appreciated it at age 16, when I saw that trailer. Probably not. I think one has to experience a lot of what Ned Merrill has before this film would really hit home - and hit home it does! I'm not going to give away any of the plot, so no need for spoiler alerts here. Suffice to say that you are painfully aware at the start that all is not as it seems, and as the story progresses the veil (of forgetfulness? of denial? of self rationalization?) is slowly and inexorably lifted, until the soul-shattering climax (which by then you've been fearfully anticipating) at the movie's end.

I truly wish I could say this movie was ""dated"", because that would mean its terrible, nihilistic vision of the hollowness of suburban life was also no longer relevant - sadly, it remains as current as last minute's Facebook posting or Instagram.

Burt Lancaster is at the top of his form here - flawless performance. Janet Landgard and Janice Rule are also superb.",1398384000,48,1366,4.434262948207171
6200523,5,B00HRISNPM,"Aged muscular Burt Lancaster swimming through the pools of suburbia in his blue trunks remains an unforgettable and timeless portrait of despair.

Like many people The Swimmer has haunted me since I first saw it.  That was in the 1970s as a teenager on a local television channel.  Though it was edited and had commercials it's power was mesmerizing.

Over the years I saw again and most recently some months ago on TCM.

Viewing this stunning Blu-ray release was like seeing it for the first time.  The color and sound bring it to new aesthetic heights.

The main lure of acquiring this were the extras.

Included is audio of author John Cheever reading the short story.  His plummy contrived upper class cadence captures the anguish of the tale.  Watching the film right after one appreciates the tremendous talent and ingenuity of neglected screenwriter Eleanor Perry who imaginatively expanded a 10 page New Yorker story into a 95 minute feature film. Among her striking inventions is of the lead character miming swimming through a drained pool with a young boy.  She artfully takes Cheever's situations and fills them out with with new characters and sharp dialogue all true to the spirit of the story.

The bulk of the bonus features is a lengthy documentary about it's production.  As most of the principal participants are deceased, first assistant director Michael Hertzberg and second assistant directorTed Zachary wryly provide most of the enlightening behind the scenes reminiscences.  Joanna Lancaster's contributes greatly with personal stories about the star, her father.  This was Marvin Hamlisch's first film score and he eloquently discusses how it came to him and the impact it had on him.  Joan Rivers looks back on her small but effective role in it and it's a reminder that she started out as a talented and serious actress.

The most revelatory fact it explores is of it's troubled production.  Eleanor Perry and her husband director Frank Perry shopped it around with no interest until legendary producer Sam Spiegel got involved, resulting in another tortuous Hollywood Faustian bargain.

8634820,3,B00HRISNPM,"Based upon a short story by John Cheever, this is about a man who decides to swim all the swimming pools that lead back to his home. His journey is a metaphor for his life and, on a broader level, the course of human lives as they go from youth to old age. Moreover, it portrays a high-class social stratum in, to my eyes, a negative light.

Burt Lancaster is cast well as the exuberant swimmer. He's built like a tank and has rugged All-American good looks. He looks like someone who has it all, whose life comes easy to him like gliding through water. On the other hand, he's able to show his deterioration movingly and convincingly.

The film is most effective when he seems to forget that his kids have grown up. This has happened with the children I know who seem to grow up overnight. Undoubtedly, all parents must feel this way. He also encounters a 20-year old who used to babysit his kids, but has also grown up.

There are hints, stronger as the film goes on, that Ned and his family have fallen on hard times because of his being laid off of work. I disagreed with this because it made his downfall seem specific rather than due to old age and life's curveballs. Such information should've been implied.

The film feels like a feature-length episode of The Twilight Zone. At the end, I imagined Rod Serling delivering his closing narration: ""Meet Ned Merrill, ""Neddy"" to his friends. On this fine August day, a day where it feels good to be alive, Ned is going to swim home. He doesn't know it yet, but his journey will take him to some unexpected places and detours leading to The Twilight Zone.""

Lastly, it should be said that Frank and Eleanor Perry, who were the originators of this project, lost control of the film to the producer, Sam Spiegel. In her notes about the project, Eleanor describes a duplicitous man who made changes to the detriment of the film. She also describes Elia Kazan in harsh terms, confirming his character as unprincipled and immoral.",1531440000,,1977,4.526610644257703

I didn't know anything about it, other than I had the soundtrack LP and loved the music.  Well, even on regular TV with one particular bit edited out (Burt's butt), even with commercials, I could not stop watching - it was mesmerizing and I couldn't wait to see it again, but it wasn't shown often and of course there was no home video or cable back then.  So, I did the next best thing and acquired a dye transfer Tech print in 16mm - and I showed it to people over and over again.  I was a bit obsessed with it, frankly.
