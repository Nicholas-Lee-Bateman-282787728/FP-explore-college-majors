7832721,5,6302976723,"I've been a fan of Nanci's for the better part of two decades, but only picked up a copy of this concert a couple of years ago.  I was not disappointed.  This is one excellent concert, with every song a gem.  Nanci's duets with other singer/songwriters (Emmylou Harris and Odetta, among others) introduced me to artists that I had not heard before.  Her duet with Jerry Jeff Walker on ""Morning Song for Sally"" is alone worth the cost of the tape. I am hoping that this concert will be re-released on DVD, but until then, my old VHS copy will have to do.",1353628800,,553,4.339805825242719
7832722,5,6302976723,This was a wonderful concert celebrating a landmark album from Nanci Griffith. The guest artists were superb. Please release on DVD !!,1316736000,2,134,5.136363636363637
7832723,5,6302976723,"Unbelieveable. One of the top live performances of all time is not available on DVD?

Nanci Griffith has put together one of the important CDs of our time. Her energy, musical skill, and personality helped bring together some songs and songwriters whose voices (along with many others who couldn't be included) have been neglected by mainstream media for many years. For those who haven't been exposed to this music, most will be happily surprised to find that such talent not only exists, but is available to be heard.

Well, most of it can be found on youtube, but a pristine DVD of this VHS tape would be a great addition to any library of American music.

And Nanci Griffith, unbelieveably, may be the greatest under-appreciated talent of all.",1309996800,2,747,4.8203125
7832724,5,6302976723,"I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing ""Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather"". Apart from this video and the guest  appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this  country. I have most of her albums.  This video is superb. The quality of  the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an  appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per  the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing  the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of  Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is  translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci  fans and lovers of mainstream country.
