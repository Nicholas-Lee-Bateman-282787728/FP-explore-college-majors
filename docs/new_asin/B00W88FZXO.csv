8712512,4,B00W88FZXO,"I was born and raised in Anjar. The films brought back old memories and stories that were also told by my ancestors. It is very simple yet effective, However, I always find it hard to get interested in these kind of films unless you know the history or have connections. A more descriptive title may have peaked a lot of interest.

On the other hand, I applaud the film makers. Anjar is near and dear to my heart. The history of the heroic people of Musa Dagh who settled in Anjar should be told as it is captured in Franz Werfel's ""Fourty Day's of Musa Dagh"" novel.",1461974400,,566,4.289719626168225
