188201,3,1571323368,"I appreciate any attempt to get Bible stories out there for public view, but its hard to recognize the original story through the contrived context.  Instead of a king, this story uses a boss of a chocolate factory.  His  underlings (our protagonists) won't bow to his chocolate bunny because they  remember what their mom told them.  No real mention of God.  I had hoped  for more from this, because I know the creators can do (and have done)  better.  Check out ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"" or ""Josh and  the Big Wall"" before you get this one.  I will admit, the Argentinian  ""Song of the Cucumber"" is a stitch.",920937600,,612,4.513761467889908

188212,5,1571323368,"We absolutely love VeggieTales!  In fact, I bought the first two VeggieTales movies at a Christian bookstore in the late 80s or early 90s when they were still obscure indie films.  The silly songs, the animated vegetables with well developed characters and the simple bible stories with morals emphasized make these wonderful movies for young kids, Christian or not.  I particularly love the Rack, Shack & Benny story because it reminds kids to do what is right, even if no one else is doing the right thing and even if there are consequences.",1469404800,,543,4.817204301075269

188217,5,1571323368,This has always been one of my favorite VeggieTales as I watched it often with my grandchildren when they were youngsters.  I highly recommend it and the message it shares.  It is a fun way to re-tell a favorite Old Testament Bible story.,1465171200,,238,4.511627906976744
188218,5,1571323368,"Haven't met a Veggie Tales movie I didn't like!  Though this one isn't necessarily on my top 5 go-to list, it is definitely a good movie with an excellent message.  It's no ""Jonah"" or ""Pirates"" but you'll still get the classic Veggie Tales message out of it, and won't have to worry about what your kids are watching.  Oh and ""The Bunny"" song is really cute!  Rack, Shack and Benny are out on their own working for Mr Nezzer at his chocolate factory.  They don't work in the best of conditions and they are soon forced to bow and sing the bunny song which is ""chock full of things they know aren't right""!  The movie does a great job not making light of standing up for what you believe in.",1464998400,,690,4.269230769230769

188353,5,1571323368,"My first thought when introduced to Veggie Tales was - you're kidding, right?  Much to my surprise I was genuinely entertained by the quirky sense of humor and easily attracted to the talking vegetables who carry things with no hands.  This story about Rack, Shack and Benny tells the story from the Bible of the 3 young men who accepted being thrown into a fiery furnace rather than worship as required an idol put before them.  This film does a nice job of introducing this story to the kids with visuals and words they can understand without being too scary.  The moral is further embedded in children's minds by being set to catchy music that my whole family enjoys singing (Mom & Dad, teenagers, tweens, elementary age and preschooler!).",1393200000,,742,4.728682170542636

188357,5,1571323368,I love Veggie Tales! They are are a great show for all ages but obviously geared towards the younger kids. They are super funny and even as an adult I get plenty of laughs while also being uplifted by their message.,1388102400,,215,4.2682926829268295

188367,4,1571323368,"Movie is good, good moral story.  Rack, Shack and Benny is based on the Bible story  of Shadrach, Meshach, & Abednigo.  The leadin is weak an unnecessary.  I used this for VBS and wished I had skipped the beginning until the story started.  Also in the middle there is a ""Silly Songs for Larry"".  This is also weak and detracts from the story.  Whole thing is about 35 minutes which is way long for young children in one sitting.  Without the front and middle unrelated parts it's about 25-28 minutes long.

The story itself is very good and I recommend it.  Very close to the Bible story in tone and teaching.  I would buy more Veggie Tales but I would always preview before showing to children.",1374883200,,696,4.444444444444445

It is especially appealing to children since it has chocolate bunnies in it!  The lessons this story teach are very important in our world today, since we have become a world that puts many idols before God.  One lesson in particular is that  children should remember the Christian teachings of their parents and not be conformed to the world.  Basically, the story is about staying true to our beliefs, no matter how much pressure we receive to turn away from them.  I would recommend this DVD for children ages five and up, and for adults who need to remember what they learned in their youth:  ""I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have no other gods before me.""

It also comes with a silly song about a dancing and singing cucumber (which may be funny to some people but others might find it a bit rude).",1119571200,2,414,4.3076923076923075
188446,4,1571323368,"Rack Shack and Benny brings many fine moments to the Veggie Tale franchise.  It boasts the first appearance of Mr. Lundt, Mr. Nezzer, Laura the Carrot and George,the security guard narrator who also narrates the Toy that Saved Christmas.  With Dave and the Giant Pickle, which came out the same year, Rack Shack and Benny departed from the previous and current Veggie format of two stories regarding the episodes theme by telling a longer story interspersed with a silly song at intermission. And what a silly song at that: An Argentinean cucumber folk ballad sung in Spanish by Larry, translated in to English by Bob; often at the interpreters expense.

The story itself adapted from the book of Daniel takes Shadrach (Bob) Meeshach (Junior Asparagus) and Abednego (Larry) from captivity to cavity prone by making them workers at a chocolate factory.  It capably tells the story of standing up to persecution for doing what you know is right.  The boys are commanded to bow down to a chocolate bunny and sing the bunny song.  They know that many of the words in the song are wrong and refuse to bow or sing.  As a result they are sentenced to be thrown in the incinerator with the rest of the ""bad"" bunnies.  I hate to leave you hanging on the plot line but you'll have to watch the video or read the bible to see how it comes out.

The only problem I have with my copy of Rack Shack and Benny is that Big Idea broke one of my favorite credos.  That credo being is ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

You see there are two versions of Rack Shack & Benny:  the original and a re-release, with the only difference being lines of dialogue in the Bunny song.  You would not think that switching lines in a song would make much of a difference but in this case it's like watching a video without actually putting in the VCR, it alters the entire presentation.

One of the lines I am referring to sung by Nebby K. Nezzer is:
I won't go to church and I won't go to school that stuff is for sissies but Bunnies are cool.  In the re-release they change the first part of the line to: ""I won't eat beans and I won't eat tofu"".  Another change is I don't love my Mom or my Dad just the bunny to something much more benign.

The problem with the line changes is that it undermines and all but obliterates the entire conflict of the plot.  It makes Rack Shack and Benny seem to be willing to give their life over gastronomical differences.

Now I understand that the line change may well be in order not to have children singing such bad lines.  But the point is that the kids in the story would not sing it.  I thought the matter was resolved in the first sing a-long video when a reformed Nebby performs a new improved version of the song advising not to make the bunny an idol.

In all, I would still highly recommend Rack Shack and Benny to veggiephiles everywhere.  And if at all possible try to get your hands on the original version and if you can, please send one to me!",1108771200,24,2966,4.352727272727273

188448,5,1571323368,"It's difficult to say something about this or any VeggieTales title that hasn't been said already. It's a Christian-lite message that kids will be entertained and educated by. It's amusing to the whole family and it's probably the best thing to happen to our religion since Easter. So to write an entire review of this volume, being a comic retelling of Shadrach, Meshiach and Abendego and the Fiery Furnace, would be banal to say the least.
But here goes.
Rack, Shack, and Benny (as the protagonists are called for short) have been removed from the King's castle and now work all day in a chocolate bunny factory under the guiding eyes of Nebby K. Nezzer (I know it's a [silly] joke, but he's a pickle! Come on!). Nezzer decides that everyone in the factory should love The Bunny as much as he does. To this end, he builds a ninety-foot rabbit and makes everyone sing ""The Bunny Song"" (this caused some real-life controversy, discussed on the DVD in detail). But our boys know not to do things that aren't right and, well, there's a lot not right about that song. Their faith saves them from the furnace and everyone lives happily ever after, even Nezzer who learns he was wrong to make them sing the song. Throw in the traditional Argentinean ballad ""The Dance of the Cucumber"" in the ""Silly Songs"" segment (and yes, the translation is accurate) and you have one of the top five VeggieTales videos ever.
Now, for the original part of my review. The other day I returned to my dorm after a long day of work. Classes, research, rehearsal, I was beat. I opened my mailbox and inside was a note that alerted me to the presence of a package at the front desk for me. It was the VeggieTales DVD I ordered. So I wasted no time popping it in and watching it. And it made my night so much better.

You know, those three guys who were best friends of Daniel (the guy famous for being thrown into a lion's den and interpretting the handwriting on the wall) who were thrown into a fiery furnace for their refusal to worship anyone but God. Instead of Babylon, this Veggie version of the story takes place in a far-off candy factory where world famous Nezzer Chocolate Bunnies are made. Larry, Bob, and Junior Asparagus star as the title trio.
Like most Veggie Tales, this one is filled with humor and wit that appeals not only to kids, but to adults as well. The lesson in the film is not about proper nutrition (as some seem to think), but instead is about standing up when you think things are wrong and not compromising one's integrity by bowing down to peer pressure.
The Silly Songs with Larry in this episode is popular ""Dance of the Cucumber"". Look for the rip on Disney parody, if you're not observant it will pass you by.",1013212800,8,1039,4.591397849462366

It is based on the Bible story in Daniel about Shadrack, Meshach, and Abednigo.  In the Bible, the three men refused to worship an idol to a false god and were thrown into a fire because of it.  They survived, because God was with them.
In Veggie Tales, Rack, Shack, and Benny also refused to do something the ""boss"" at the chocolate factory told them to do -- pig out on chocolate bunnies while neglecting more nutritious foods.  For that, they were thrown into a fiery furnace and survived.
The problem I see is that what the men in the Bible took a stand for was worth risking their lives for. Proper nutrition, while certainly wise and desirable to do, is not.  I thought that rather than properly tell this Bible story, (in an entertaining way, as the other Veggie Tales do) the video distorted it.
It still has a lot going for it, and I think it is certainly possible for parents to teach their child the REAL story and the more important truth behind it on their own, so I wouldn't want to discourage people from getting it.  But if you don't have all the Veggie Tales videos, well, buy another one first.",981849600,13,1376,4.368627450980392
188455,5,1571323368,"In our family's opinion, this is the best VeggieTales Video - and we love them all!  VeggieTales is the best thing to happen to kid's entertainment [and adult entertainment!] ever.  Our whole family enjoys watching these videos over and over, and we know the songs by heart - toddler and adults alike!  VeggieTales truly has something for every age group and I don't know anyone who doesn't enjoy these videos [even my non-Christian family members can't help but enjoy them!].
Rack, Shack, and Benny is the best in our opinion - even though they are all awesome.  The music in this one is GREAT [all the songs stick in your brain and make you want to sing out loud].  We also like the characters in this one.  As the mom of a small daughter, I really like the fact that Laura the Carrot [the only real recurring female character in the whole series] gets to do something brave to try to save Rack, Shack, and Benny.  This a great tale and is redone marvelously in this video!  I highly recommend this one to everyone!",975196800,9,1017,4.489130434782608
188456,4,1571323368,"Fans of ""Toy Story,"" The Bible, or fresh salads (guess that covers everybody) will enjoy VeggieTales, half-hour videos telling faithful (ungarnished?), fun Bible story adaptations starring a tomato (Bob),  cucumber (Larry), carrot (Laura) and asparagas (Junior) aimed to kids'(and  adults')pressures and problems.
""Rack, Shack, and Benny,"" (aka  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego) is one of the series' best. It retells the  story of the Fiery Furnace as a parable about peer pressure with catchy  songs (""The Bunny Song"" is a favorite despite its intentionally  inappropriate message, ""Dance of the Cucumber"" is a hilarious  ""silly song"" and tension breaker), cute one-liners (""What  does being a junior executive mean?"" ""It means you have to wear a  tie."") and kid-friendly suspense leading to God's climactic rescue  where the three (""Now there's four, and one looks real shiny"")  are saved. The lesson is summed at the end with a pinch of good  humor.
Kudos (Bacos?) to Phil Vischer and his merry band at Big Idea for  creating a series which, like its stars, are good and good for you. It's a  series to relish, and HIGHLY recommended.",956793600,28,1138,5.181318681318682
188457,4,1571323368,"A very enjoyable video...one of the reviewers talked about the Bunny Song being objectionable.  That's the point of the song...they don't want to sing the Bunny Song because it is disrespectful. I believe that's a slight flaw with the video, the producers made the Bunny Song too catchy. And the  ""New and Improved"" lyrics aren't quite up to par with the first  lyrics.  However, overall Rack, Shack and Benny is a clever story, great  music, and finally a great message.  I'm so thankful for Big Idea and  Veggie Tales!",951868800,5,520,4.775280898876405

I find myself singing the bunny song to make my son laugh when he's feeling mopey  and I think it's a prerequisite for every mommy to learn the ""wherever  you are"" song.  The entire video is fabulous!  I am always genuinely  pleased when he opts to put in this video above his others.",945820800,4,419,4.294871794871795

With God you always win, but you do have to stand up  for what you believe in. Bob, Jr. and Larry are right on target with not  bowing down to Mr. Nezzer's big chocolate bunny. My children had no problem  figuring out that God was with them in the firey furnace and they got the  concept of the video right away. I highly recommed it!",940809600,8,503,4.319148936170213
