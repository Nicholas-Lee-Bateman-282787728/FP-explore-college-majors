The fun is good in small doses but, over time you yourself will get punch drunk

It starts off very interesting New Jack can hang with the Iron Sheik and Honky Tonk Man
Everything is fun and insightful but, by the end the three are so whacked out on god knows what
The three are mooning the camera and having a laugh!

Maybe if RF is gonna do shoots like this (They should make sure the participants are sober and aware)

This interview is all over the place and I loved every bit of it. New Jack, The Shiek and Honky Tonk Man present one of the best shoots ever. They discuss a wide variety of topics which include very passionate commentaries on the Benoit's, Dusty Rhodes, you name it. If nothing else these guys make you wanna party with them.",1336780800,,473,4.266666666666667
