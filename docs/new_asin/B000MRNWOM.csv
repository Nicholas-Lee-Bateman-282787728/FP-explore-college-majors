8356006,5,B000MRNWOM,"Su Friedrich is incredible. How she is able to craft a story out of stories is mesmerizing. Her words have the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose. Her work is short, yet powerful. After forty-seven minutes, I had pages of notes, the same as a full-length feature, yet her films are by no means taxing to watch. Though her work has many layers, it is not impossible to understand. The film is well-crafted, well-written.
Honestly, I find many non-fiction films to be something of a bore, and I was surprised to be so engaged and fascinated by Friedrich. I watched this three times consecutively and several more times in my week's rental. Then I bought her collection of works. Really, truly brilliant.",1367625600,,717,4.790322580645161
8356007,5,B000MRNWOM,"A backwards trip through the alphabet serves as a brilliant storytelling device for writer-director Su Friedrich to remember and reflect on her father.

One of the most esteemed experimental filmmakers working today, Su Friedrich has won fans at film festivals around the world for the last twenty-plus years.

Lyrical, poetic, passionate and innovative, Su Friedrich's films are among the most rewarding cinematic delicacies you'll ever find, and an exhilarating experience for adventurous audiences weary of the same old conventional lesbian movies. While Friedrich (who happens to be a lesbian) has often made films that are not specifically ""about"" being a lesbian, she always manages to have a uniquely queer perspective on any topic she tackles. Her filmmaking defies traditional genres, falling to rest in a hybrid genre that incorporates fiction, non-fiction, and so much more.

In case you can't tell, I'm one of her biggest fans. I highly recommend this film to viewers interested in seeing something new and different!",1173052800,5,1029,5.41875
