3676162,5,B001KZVQJS,"I think season 9 is the best yet of the Murder She Wrote saga; however, I have thoroughly enjoyed all seasons as they progress with excellent actors, special guest stars and, of course, with the regular cast from Cabot Cove and returning special regular cast members from Mrs. Fletcher's hometown episodes to her many trips abroad. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1236902400,,353,5.103448275862069

Excellent, waiting for future releases.",1236729600,,243,15.2
3676164,4,B001KZVQJS,"""Murder She Wrote"" stars Angela Lansbury as mystery writer and amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher, who has a knack for discovering dead bodies wherever she goes.  As the police stumble into dead ends, Jessica unscrambles clues and learns whodunit through a combination of Sherlock Holmesian deduction and imagination.  Guest stars in Season 9 include Susan Blakely, Cesar Romero, Joseph Bologna, Harvey Fierstein, Mariette Hartley, Margot Kidder, Cynthia Nixon, Neil Patrick Harris, and Lee Merriweather.",1235779200,8,501,5.8493150684931505
3676165,4,B001KZVQJS,"As I have said in my previous reviews, Murder She Wrote is my favorite TV show, as the lead character ( Jessica Flethcer, played by the amazing Angela Lansbury) has more depth and dimension than any other female lead on TV. I find her character inspirational and soothing.
With that being said, I must urge people to watch seasons 1-7 before season 9, as the writing is MUCH better, as are the guest stars and plots. Season 8 was bad, and really had a different feel that 1-7.
This season ( 9) returns to the traditional MSW writing, but Angela's character still doesn't have the same feel to her, and seems much more metropolitan than 1-7. The character is frequently in New York ( and where in 1-7 the New York episodes were some of the strongest, they are not as strong in 8 and 9).
YOU CAN WATCH SEASON 10 AND 11 ON NETFLIX!!!!! NO JOKE!!!",1234224000,14,843,4.375796178343949
3676166,5,B001KZVQJS,"Finally, Season 9 is here. I can not wait for the 9th season of Murder, She Wrote. While I enjoyed season 8, Season 9 gets back to JB's fun. I felt that season 8 was trying too hard to take JB out of Cabot Cove and make her more international (or New Yorker). I felt that too many cases in Season 8 were just not fun. Season 9 delivers. In particular, A Christmas Secret which actually someone is almost murdered in Cabot Cove. I also enjoyed The Dead File in which Jessica is used as a characteur of herself in a comic strip. BUT my favorite would have to me The Wind in the Tower. It takes place in Ireland. A man dies but is it natural or murder?  If your reading this then you are a fan. Season 9 is much more fun than season 8 (in fact the beginning has JB's typewriter instead of the word processor used in S8). I wish that Universal would release the seasons more quickly. I am anxiously awaiting the made for TV movies. I can't wait for Feb. to get here. Keep it up Ms. Lansbury!  EVER THE FLETCHER FAN!",1232150400,24,1011,4.101010101010101
3676167,5,B001KZVQJS,"This was the second year where Jesica would go between Cabot Cove and New York and sometimes overseas to places like Ireland.  Angela Lansbury is at her best with this series even though the series almost didn't go past season 7 so we are greatful she kept it going for another 3 seasons after this one.

So for people who like murder/mystery and seeing actors from the past and some in the future actors that have since become famous",1230508800,12,434,4.481012658227848

3676232,5,B001KZVQJS,"This delightful TV series came out in the 1980s and can still be seen in reruns today.  The marvelous Angela Lansbury plays Jessica Fletcher, small town Mainer and mystery novelist, (who becomes a bit more sophisticated as the series continues).  Ms. Lansbury's performance never varies - it's always excellent - as she takes her warm and appealing character through solving one murder mystery after another.  Why buy the DVDs when you can watch the show in reruns on TV?  because you can tune in any time you want - and not have to watch a single commercial.  Highly recommend the entire series or any portion thereof.",1392940800,2,619,4.80188679245283

3676242,5,B001KZVQJS,Watching Jessica solve her crimes is my nightly entertainment. I prefer her location to be in Cabot Cove but realistically if all the murders occurred in this small town in Maine it would be time to move in the National Guard!

3676270,5,B001KZVQJS,"I have loved Murder She Wrote since watching the first season as a thirteen year-old back in 1984. Though I love all the seasons, I am particularly fond of the earlier seasons, and was not really happy when Jessica made brief appearances in one of the later seasons [with other characters standing in and solving cases]. Season 9 however turned out to be a winning season putting the show back on top with compelling plots and excellent acting all around.

The episodes in Season 9 have interesting plots:
""Murder in Milan"" - Jessica investigates the murder of film producer Catherine Wayne during the Milan Film Festival.
""Family Secrets"" - I love it when the stories are set in Cabot Cove, Maine. Here Jessica helps uncover a 30-year-old scandal in Cabot Cove when her ex-student is murdered in the course of writing a book about it.
""The Mole"" - A case of mistaken identity has Jessica kidnapped and when the woman she is mistaken for is killed, Jessica investigates.
""The Wind Around the Tower"" - I loved this episode. Jessica teams up with old friend, Sean Culhane [George Hearn] to solve the murder of their host at a country estate in Ireland.
""The Dead File"" - Jessica finds herself at the receiving end of a satirical comic strip in NY.
""Night of the Coyote"" - Jessica investigates the murder of an old mining town entrepreneur.
""Sugar and Spice, Malice and Vice"" - Agent Michael Hagarty [Len Cariou] finds himself in a spot after he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of his daughter's fiancee.
""The Classic Murder"" - A psychic is found murdered after foretelling the murder of a missing tycoon.
""A Christmas Secret"" - one of my favorite episodes of this season. It has to do with secrets and is set in Cabot Cove.
""The Sound of Murder"" - Jessica investigates a murder that happens during a taping of a rock video.
""Final Curtain"" - An actor's personal manager is murdered. Set in Cabot Cove.
""Double Jeopardy"" - Jessica investigates the murder of a slumlord in NY.
""Dead Eye"" - Introduces recurring character Charlie Garrett [Wayne Rogers]. Jessica attends a writer's convention in Miami and investigates a murder.
""Killer Radio""  - A potential buyer of a radio station is murdered. Set in the Midwest.
""The Petrified Florist"" - A Beverly Hills florist supplying fodder to tabloid mags is murdered.
""Threshold of Fear"" - A woman who lives in isolation fears for her life when the killer she envisions in her dreams attempts to see her in real life, but then turns up dead.
""The Big Kill"" - Jessica investigates two murders in Cabot Cove that have to do with industrial espionage.
""Dead to Rights"" - Jessica questions the veracity of her ex-researcher Dana Ballard [Molly Hagan], who was a compulsive liar.
""Lone Witness"" - A delivery boy swears his innocence when he is suspected of murder. It is left to Jessica to prove his innocence.
""Ship of Thieves"" - Jessica and Dennis Stanton investigate murder on the high seas aboard a cruise ship.
""The Survivor"" - Jessica's computer tech finds her life in peril.
""Love's Deadly Desire"" - Set in Cabot Cove, novelist Sybilla Stone's sister is found murdered wearing Sybilla's cloak, but was it a case of mistaken identity instead?

Apart from the intriguing plots, I also enjoyed identifying many familiar names who made regular appearances in various TV shows throughout the 80s and 90s, and even earlier. A wonderful season of MSW!",1237939200,19,3393,4.796581196581196
3676271,5,B001KZVQJS,"the first set of the ninth season had a couple of defective discs in it. I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent me another set of discs to replace the defective set. There was no hassle and the replacement set came to me in a matter of days. I enjoy ordering from Amazon and can't wait until the tenth series comes out. Thank you Amazon!

8316723,5,B001KZVQJS,"Season nine is filled with the usual suspicious characters, some are repeat actors in different roles, looking and acting the same.  I found that confusing, especially when they died in a previous episode.  Its not as if there has ever been a shortage of actors that they needed to keep reusing the same ones.

Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) spent more time away from home in this season.  The downside to this was seeing less of William Windom (Dr. Seth Hazlitt).  She should have taken him with her, he makes a great sidekick.",1505347200,,532,4.739130434782608
