8502003,5,0965214001,"Home Video Hits is an entertaining and educational video abouthow one can improve home videos.  The video uses a good storyline and spectacular special effects to make the concepts enjoyable.  The video begins with one man that faces the problem of horrible home videos. He has guests over to watch his videos and gets upset after they leave because his videos are boring.  While worrying about the videos, he is sucked into the television, where he meets Captain Cam. Captain Cam teaches him The Direct Approach, the video's main idea. After the meeting with Captain Cam, the man meets other characters, and continues to learn new ideas about home video production.  Once the man's journey is complete, he shows several examples that reenforce the vocabulary learned earlier in the video.

 The animations and other special effects make the video interesting to watch. The animations are very well done.  The effects are always used for a purpose, and never distract the viewers from the material being dealt with. In summary, Home Video Hits is an outstanding piece of work.  It is definitely a necessity for every camcorder owner.",941241600,6,1133,5.021390374331551
