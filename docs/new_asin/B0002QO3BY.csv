2115930,5,B0002QO3BY,"I bought this DVD set and can't say enough great things about these movies AND their creators, Tom Laughlin & Delores Taylor.  What wonderful people they were then and are now!  They took the chances most people are afraid to take and stood up for what they believed in and I am so greatful to them for that.  And greatful for the lessons they have taught me which are as valuable as any I've ever learned in my life.  When the singer sings ""you are my teacher"" at the end of 'Trial of B.J.' I surely can relate!

Back in the 70's these movies literally enlightened and changed my life!  And after watching them all over again (including the 'Billy Jack Goes to Washington' which never got released) I have to say I think they are changing things yet again in my life, in ways I never imagined.

I get upset with all the negative comments I read regarding the karate scenes(there are only 2 karate scenes in each, 'Billy Jack' & 'Trial of B.J.') probably less than 5-6 minutes of the total movie, yet people seem to ONLY remember those scenes and not all the PEACE & LOVE demonstrated throughout the movies.

I'd recomend this set to anyone today and feel it's as current now (yes, just listen to the current daily news!) as it was in the 70's.  I think all kids in high school should see this also as a lesson.  Just look at what the government was up to then as it is now and you may agree.",1142294400,26,1392,4.278625954198473
2115931,5,B0002QO3BY,"A nice upgrade from the 4-disc Billy Jack Collection. The major improvement here is that all 4 films have been digitally remastered in their original widescreen aspect ratio from the original film negatives. The color and the clarity look superb with very little artifacts. Though I just got this set and haven't watched each film in their entirety, I did sample the beginning of each disc and was amazed at how breathtaking and clear the opening scenes were for both ""Billy Jack"" and ""Trial."" The transfers for ""Born Losers"" and ""Washington"" look just as fantastic. These really make the transfers on the last set look inferior, especially since I played them back to back and did a comparison.

The sound has also been digitally remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. and each film includes both a newly recorded 2005 commentary track from the Laughlin family as well as the original 2000 filmmaker commetary from the last set. The discs come in a slipcase with digipak and each disc has it's own tray with the original poster art for each film beneath the tray and printed on the actual disc. The running times for each are ""Born Losers"" (113 minutes); ""Billy Jack"" (118 minutes); ""Trial..."" (171 minutes); ""Washington"" (114 minutes).

The set also includes a 5th disc of bonus features. Unfortunately it's not as good as I would've hoped, but I'm not complaining since I'm so impressed with the transfers of the actual films themselves. The bonus features included a very short documentary about the making of the films; Trivia Quiz; several original TV ad for 'Billy Jack"" only; Billy Jack Book Excerpt; Cut-Your-Own Fight contest info; Website info; and a photo gallery. Nothing too impressive.

Overall the transfers themselves are widescreens and look and sound amazing, enough for me to say that alone is worth the upgrade.",1127260800,76,1835,4.970684039087948
2115932,1,B0002QO3BY,"This will mark the THIRD time Ventura Distribution has released ""Billy Jack"" on DVD. There is a standalone version, the one found on the ""Billy Jack Collection"", and now this. (Warner also released the film on DVD, also flat screen and no extras.) The description above suggests a widescreen release, although with 4 movies (on 5 disks?!), I'm not yet convinced we won't be seeing yet again another pan & scan release of this dated, but still collectable cult film. The VHS and laserdisc versions were also pan & scan -- what the heck?! If this release in indeed the widescreen version, it will be the very first time the real version has been released on home video in any format. But here's the catch: you have to drop somewhere in the ballpark of fifty bucks to get it. I guess if this ploy works, then Rhino will have the green light to release a second trilogy of the ""Walking Tall"" movies to finally escape their horrendous VHS dump on disk. (And Rhino's already released that film pan & scan THREE times on DVD!) I just cannot reward studios with my money when they stoop to trickery such as this. I feel sorry for the poor suckers who bought the last Billy Jack box (since the Amazon details have no mention of widescreen). I already wasted my money on the Warner version, which I paid a fair price for, but got a gyp disk. I'll just do without, thank you.

UPDATED NOTE: Pre-emptive strike here: My references to pan & scan are maybe misleading. I have no way of knowing the aspect ratio this film was shot in, even IMDb doesn't say. But I saw this in the theater and the picture was not square, so the existing DVD's of this film are ""formatted to fit the screen"" (my Warner disc begins with that disclaimer). Can't people who hate letterboxed DVD's just zoom in to lose the top/bottom bars? Let me guess...they don't want to miss any of the picture. (sigh)",1125014400,10,1867,4.475073313782991

2115935,4,B0002QO3BY,"Billy Jack 35th Anniversary Ultimate Collection

These are the four movies that feature the Billy Jack character created by and for Tom Loughlin that illustrated his martial arts skills and his philosophical outlook. Billy Jack is a lone man who often acts to protect people from repression and injustice by powerful interests (like the Lone Ranger or various cowboys in many of the old Western movies). Remember stories about Robin Hood? This medieval outlaw was later turned into a fighter for popular rights centuries later. In the late 19th century Jesse James became another example (he robbed banks and express companies). Billy Jack himself is not an outlaw but skirts the law to provide justice. Laws are created to produce justice, the law should always be subservient to justice. For detailed comments on each of these movies read the individual reviews.

Born Losers [1967] takes place in a California resort town. A biker gang is there {to sell drugs to tourists). The people are afraid of them, the authorities protect them. What can be done to help the people? Who will do it?

Billy Jack [1971] takes place in the southwest. Wild mustangs on Indian lands are being illegally harvested for dog food. Who can stop this? Are there inter-generational conflicts? Who can protect the Freedom School at the reservation? The shocking dramatic scenes made it a big hit at the time.

The Trial of Billy Jack [1974] is the next chapter in this series. The Freedom School continues on an abandoned military base; they start a local TV station. There are references to this era. Billy goes to prison for his self-defense. There are many dramatic scenes that extend its running time. There is more action, some of it echoes actual events.

Billy Jack Goes to Washington [1977] is the last of this series, it was censored by the corporate theater syndicates. It is an updated version of the 1939 movie (Mr. Smith ...) which I found better and more relevant. It called for a National Initiative to allow the people to override the laws passed by and for our corporate ruling class. This would do nothing about the corporate media that controls or influences the thinking of most people, and, can negate the hopes and purpose of an National Initiative. Creating a new media system would result in a New Class to control or influence people. Or am I wrong?",1431561600,2,2353,4.843283582089552

  All discs but the bonus disc are defective. I personally purchased 3 seperate box sets and every movie cubes,scrambles,sound loss,

 not watch the films in their intirety. It's unfortunate, because the box set is wonderfully layed out and packeged nicely.

2115950,5,B0002QO3BY,"I first saw Billy Jack in my law student days when the movie was first released.  Then, I saw the sequel, saw what was his first appearance in that (silly) biker-genre flick and waited all this time to see the last in the franchise (and now we know why that was the last one).  I'd recorded the original Billy Jack movie (not the biker flick) on BETA tape, VHS, missed-out on purchasing the old LP movie theme to Billy Jack by a day's delay in plunkin' down my money when I saw it on a display and had to record the title theme ""One Tin Soldier"" off the VHS recording to play as a sing-along in the very first Church Worship Service I officiated as a Lay effort.  To find it available in this format was a real blessing and notwithstanding the last flick or the biker flick, if you're a Billy Jack fan, you'll enjoy this, no doubt about it.  Things like 'technical' aspects -- you'll have to look at someone who appreciates those things like production values etc.  I'm still looking at it from the lens of a child of the 1950-60's and its powerful message contained in the movie as a whole and the exceptionally moving opening scene and rendition of ""One Tin Soldier"" before Billy Jack appears to thwart the malicious intention of the establishment rancher.  Yes, Billy's resort to violence isn't quite 21st century politically correct; but the issue about his internal struggles between principles/values and conduct when confronted with a world-life issue --  that's timeless and as relevant today as during the Vietnam and Civil Right's era of the 1960s!",1243641600,2,1558,4.6231884057971016

2115961,2,B0002QO3BY,"BILLY JACK has achieved cult status over the years.  Why, I really couldn't tell you.  It is an early 1970's love/peace/hippie/bad society movie.  Billy Jack is a troubled soul who came home scarred from Viet Nam (a Mai Lai style massacre of civilians is depicted in the 3rd film, TRAIL OF BILLY JACK.)  In BORN LOSERS (a late entry in the biker genre) he takes on a motorcycle gang led by Jeremy Slate, eventually killing him and various fools who get in the way. BILLY JACK is about a town that tries to run out the peaceful hippie Freedom School. (Look carefully and you will spot a very young Howard Heshmann from WKRP IN CINCINATI).  Spear-headed by corrupt local rich s.o.b. Bert Freed, Billy Jack once again answers the call to justice (though it is never explained he got out of jail after shooting someone in the head in the previous film) and in his quest for inner peace and spiritual awakening adds to his body count.  Cannot comment on TRAIL OF BILLY JACK -- it's one of those films like David Lynch's DUNE that invariably put me to sleep.  The premise of BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON is so stupid as to be beyond belief.  Tom Laughlin and his wife Delores Taylor were trying to dust off the corpse and bring him back for a 5th chapter where he leads a movement to have GW Bush and Dick Cheney impeached and driven from office.

2115973,4,B0002QO3BY,"Supposing that you want a set of Billy Jack Movies, this is a good one. For a while, in that era of sartorial horrors known as the 70s, Billy Jack was a very popular film franchise. This collection of all four movies is a great boon for fans. Those who are not fans would have no interest anyway.

The series morphed a great deal over its run. BORN LOSERS took place in Southern California and involved a man protecting a rape victim from bikers. The rest move the story to Arizona and add Indian mysticism to the basic plot of an honest guy protecting others.

The series also varies quite a bit in quality. Production values were worse early on but the films were better. That too is a familiar story.

Individual Synopses appear below:

BORN LOSERS
This was the movie that started the Billy Jack franchise of the early 70s and it is definitely a product of that era in everything from costume to style to dialog to location.

Tom Laughlin plays Billy Jack, a mysterious loner who is part Indian and recently released from the Special Forces in Vietnam. He is trying to get along in southern California but is handicapped with such traits as a conscience. He gets arrested on ""vigilante"" charges when he saves a young boy from being beaten to death by a biker gang. This puts him off of the good citizenship ideal.

This same motorcycle gang mentioned before has more to its activities than just beating kids bloody. It also like such recreational pastimes as rape. When a group of girls is hospitalized after a particularly brutal rape, the DA desperately wants at least one of them to press charges but all of the girls are frightened of retaliation. The gang victimizes each one further to ensure their silence.

On of the girls is spunkier than the rest. She decides to prosecute and the gang comes after her. She runs straight into Billy Jack's arms and Billy Jack stiffens her resolve and helps to protect her when the local sheriff proves unable to do so.

The action in this movie is understated by today's standards and the fights are really laughable. They do make their points, though and the point of the movie is not action but justice.

BILLY JACK
This is the second of the Billy Jack Series.

It is a few years later  (than BORN LOSERS) and Billy Jack is now living on an Indian reservation in Arizona. On the same reservation, there is an experimental school that is short on rules, long on the counter-culture and even longer on hacking off the officials of the local town.

Billy Jack acts as sort of an unofficial protector for the school. He makes a strange compatriot for the head of the school. She is a pacifist who will endure practically anything, including rape, to keep from using violence. Billy Jack, on the other hand, is a former green beret and doesn't hesitate to use violence when necessary.

Tensions build between the school and the town and things come to a head when the runaway daughter of a corrupt deputy sheriff funs off to the school. The deputy wants her back and is willing to do anything to get her, including frame and/or kill innocent people. While Billy tries to protect and, occasionally, avenge, he becomes the target of officialdom and a fugitive.

This story is no more complex than that of the first movie. Neither is it any better acted. Even so, there is something compelling about it.

THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK
BILLY JACK closed with Billy being arrested for manslaughter. This film opens with an extremely long sequence featuring the director of the school Billy was protecting in the last installment, recounting a long list of grievances to a reporter. In this sequence, virtually every hippie stereotype and left wing cause is aired. Intermingled with this retrospective diatribe are flashbacks of Billy Jack's legal trial and prison sentence.

The ""trial"" referred to in the title does not seem to be the legal one mentioned above. After being released from prison, Billy undergoes a personal trial, replete with Indian mysticism. He is seeking to become a less violent person. This is the backdrop for the real point of the film.

All events lead up to staging a massacre at the school similar in nature to the historic one at Kent State University. The movie is virtually a tribute to those who lost their lives. Little else is accomplished in terms of story or drama.

The movie makes some valid and even good points about the politics of the day and indicts justs about everything associated with ""The Establishment"". It also back a few losing points of view. Whether these points of view are agreed with or not, however, the film could have been much stronger and made its point better.

This is a very long film. That made it proportionally more difficult to sit through. It is propaganda of its time. It has germs of truth within but those germs are lost with the sledgehammer method of delivering the message.

BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON
The basic story is right out of the Jimmy Stewart classic. A senator dies and, in a politically pandering move, Billy Jack is appointed as the replacement. The Senior senator wants to make sure that nothing remotely political gets put on his plate. Billy Jack decides to sponsor a bill for a youth camp and the senior senator encourages him, thinking it will keep him out of his hair. Everything falls to pieces, though, when Billy reveals the location of his proposed camp. A nuclear power plant is secretly being proposed for the site. This puts him at odd with the powers that be and results in a titanic struggle of good vs. evil. It just gets nastier when Billy refuses to knuckle under to intimidation.

There are a few differences from the original movie. The bogeyman here is nuclear power and, more generally, politicians. Also, this being a Billy Jack movie, there are the obligatory martial arts scenes starring the newly minted senator.

The movie gets some things right. It is appropriately cynical about Washington and politicians. It portrays corruption as the norm and it does so believably. It also makes an effort to use some sentimental imagery and footage to stir up patriotic feelings. It does not work with this cast.

This is nowhere near as good as the Jimmy Stewart movie but it is quite watchable. It is also much better than THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK.",1186963200,7,6288,4.675724637681159
2115974,4,B0002QO3BY,"You have to admire Laughlin's passion for this character. Just listen to the commentary on any disk.  Granted the films are extremely dated, but there is an undercurrent of contemporary attitudes toward our government, war and Americans in general.  While you may not agree with Laughlin's liberal leanings, you have to admire the fact that a film this critical of the establishment can be freely made in this country. Politics aside, the film Billy Jack is the best in the collection but all the films have merit.  I recommend this collection especially if you like films from the seventies.",1186617600,2,592,4.959595959595959

2115977,5,B0002QO3BY,"The Billy Jack series ALL-in-one DVD is fantastic! I know people have complained about: Billy Jack Goes to Washington; BUT IT TOO IS A WELL WRITTEN, WELL DIRECTED, AND A WELL ACTED MOVIE! The problem is, Billy Jack's attitudes of so profoundly mis-trusting governmental authority as in his previous movies is not the same in the Washinton movie. The Washington movie has Billy Jack trusting at least one Senator because of that Senator's relationship with Billy Jack's father before he was found dead( just like in: Mr. Smith Goes To Washington), however if this trust had existed for as long as it was implied, Billy Jack would have called on this Senator's assistance in the previous movies... So its like, 'where did this come from?'. Taken by itself a wonderful remake!!!",1180051200,3,775,4.923664122137405
2115978,5,B0002QO3BY,I am very happy with these movies and their quality. It had been a long time since I had seen these. A flood of memories were welcomed. These movies tell an important story that should be watched periodically just as a reminder. The movies have been remastered to a very good quality. Remember what you are buying. These movies are not from yesterday. Be ready to turn down the volume of the motorcycles. They really sound off good in the stereo speakers. Each movie progressively reaches better production and direction quality but I still like the first the best. Enjoy your purchase.,1178928000,2,586,4.754901960784314
2115979,5,B0002QO3BY,"The only complaint I have about this wonderful box set is on Billy Jack Goes To Washington. I have the DVDs from a prior purchase elsewhere and BJGTW was Widescreen then, too. The sound in one particular scene talking about the National Initiative the sound cuts in and out for a few seconds. It didn't do this on the 2000 Box Set, why is it doing it now? Is there something wrong with the digital transfer? I exchanged it and it still has it, I want to hear the entire movie without reverting to the original box set I have. Can it be fixed? I know it seems minor and insignificant, but, I like the films to be done right.
Otherwise, this is a fine collection of a wonderful film series. It is worth the money. They are suppose to be working on a new Billy Jack movie for release in 2008. Keep up the good work Delores and Tom.

2115981,5,B0002QO3BY,I turned 40 this year and thought back to the old days with the heroic Billy Jack.  I haven't seen it at the video stores and so I decided to look online.  I would have paid the same amount just for one movie.  Brings back wonderful memories!  Great classic to have at home!,1173312000,3,274,4.113207547169812
2115982,4,B0002QO3BY,"One of my favorite Twin Cities pundits has said that the 1970s ""began with Billy Jack and ended with the first Sex Pistols album."" Having just viewed this movie for the first time in over thirty years, I can see why ""Billy Jack"" got its fifteen minutes (or less) of iconography. It has everything an early-70s cultural extravaganza could hope for: an epic struggle between good (peace-lovin,' folk-tune warblin' hippie youth) and thoroughly despicable evil (raping a skinny-dipping schoolmarm??! Shooting beautiful wild mustangs for... DOG FOOD??!!), and best of all, slow-mo martial arts (which would later be copped for the classic 70s TV show, ""Kung Fu""). I loved it as a twelve year old, and still enjoyed it last night--and not *entirely* for campy, ironic reasons.

What still holds up thirty-plus years later is the Southwest scenery, some of the real Native American actors featured (although Billy Jack himself looks about as Indian as my Uncle Ole), and the organic feel of some of the scenes: I'd bet that many town council meetings of the era looked and felt about like the culture-clash depicted in the film. Although some of the more free-form scenes tended to drag, one could argue that they were accurate real-time depictions of the era.

The ""70s moments"" that had me alternatively chuckling and shaking my head were almost too numerous to mention, but included: the earnest, off-key folk singing (and equally earnest, but ear-bleedingly shrill, theme song); the untalented attempts at improv and street theater; Bernard's fancy new ""$6,000 car""; the aforementioned schoolmarm's funky sideburns. But most of all, Billy Jack (aka Tom Laughlin) himself is a real doozy: so steadfast, so conflicted and tormented, so seriously spouting pseudo-spiritual babble while getting ready to kung-fu the crap out of someone. He is so obsessive and near-psychotic in his Great Protector role that its surprising that they let him hang around all those gentle hippies, in lieu of having him committed: it's a bit like having Travis Bickle (another 70s troubled loner) in charge of security. When Billy Jack finally takes that bullet, nearly goes down in the big shootout (there's even a character named ""O.K. Corrales,"" for Pete's sake) and surrenders himself to the authorities in the wake of the raised fists of his young charges, one thinks: *finally*, Billy can get the help he needs.

Alas, the Tom Laughlin franchise was short-lived, with two truly wretched movies to follow before petering out altogether. Given the opportunity, he's probably champing at the bit to give us ""Billy Jack Returns Yet Again"" or some such thing. However, I'm happy to settle for this flawed, deeply silly yet highly entertaining timepiece and haul it out from the archives whenever I want to revisit my twelve-year old self.",1169942400,8,2813,5.110869565217391
