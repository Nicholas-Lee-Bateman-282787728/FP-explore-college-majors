4154304,2,B003M0NLTW,"Another horrorable sexploitation film loosely based on the Damon series with Rottweiler playing dah Debil stand in without mercy killings.  I am surprised that such an excellent actress as Yvonne DeCarlo would participate in this travesty.  Money talks and Bullshite, well it rules Hollyweird with an iron something or other!",1444780800,,325,5.48
4154305,4,B003M0NLTW,"Hester (Yvonne De Carlo- SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS, NOCTURNA, CELLAR DWELLER, AMERICAN GOTHIC, TV's THE MUNSTERS) lives w/ Greta, her friendly  Rottweiler. Hester just wants her family to be close, though she knows that most of them can't stand her, and just want her vast fortune. So, Hester decides to use her occult powers to set things straight. After some nifty incantations, she visits her beloved niece, Audrey (Stephanie Dunnam- SILENT RAGE), leaving Greta behind as a ""gift"" for her. Needless to say, things aren't as they appear to be! Soon, Hester's family starts shrinking, due to a series of Greta-induced ""accidents"". The police are stumped, unable to prove anything about these ""coincidences"". More satanic mumbo jumbo brings more bizarre occurrences. PLAY DEAD is a low-budget horror movie from 1983. Released by TROMA, it's one of their better acquisitions. Contains semi-gory violence, nudity, and plenty of 80's cheeeze. Somewhat slow in several spots, but Ms. De Carlo is at her best. Quite enjoyable...",1444435200,2,1018,5.3229813664596275

4154308,5,B003M0NLTW,"Play Dead is a 1983 B-Film starring Yvonne De Carlo. She plays a wild role that is fun to see. She looks great. Fans Of Yvonne De Carlo, and lovers of B-Films of the 1980's will like this the most.",1434153600,,197,3.95
4154309,5,B003M0NLTW,"A camp classic! Filmed entirely in Dallas TX, it has lots of local color. DeCarlo plays a hauntingly evil dowager. Check it out.",1419638400,,128,4.608695652173913

8399983,3,B003M0NLTW,"Lily Munster HATES her family, but the reason(s) why are quite flimsy at best (and certainly don't warrant MURDER). Anyway, Lily decides to kill her kin (using evil Satanic magic). Greta, her pet Rottweiler, becomes the instrument of her destruction! The possessed dog kills its victims in very TAME and BLOODLESS ways. The lack of violence and gore truly makes this movie feel like a ""made-for-TV"" flick, and that definitely hurts the overall presentation. Also, you can tell there's not much story here, so it's padded to the brim with FILLER. Viewers are subjected to long, dull scenes that go nowhere, and the dog attacks themselves are shot in slow-motion. The worst part is that two boring, bumbling cops eat up a TON of screen time trying to solve the murders. This could've been a fun ""bad"" movie, but instead it's just mildly entertaining. 3 stars.",1519862400,,857,4.876712328767123
8399984,2,B003M0NLTW,"Key takeaways from the movie:

- Post-funeral sex is the best sex
- Rottweilers are pervs
- As today, British and American cars suck
- Young cops always go to fancy colleges
- Satanism is a good retirement hobby
- Dog leashes are normally 8 feet long
- Never trust seniors with dogs, especially at night",1487894400,3,303,4.410714285714286

8399988,4,B003M0NLTW,"For nostalgic purposes, 1980's grindhouse horror film, and the beautiful Yvonne De Carlo playing another wicked character, this was enjoyable and entertaining to watch. It's certainly dated and I can see how some people (mostly much younger generation) wouldn't appreciate this, but being a huge fan of Yvonne and her work, this is a MUST SEE!",1472774400,,343,5.142857142857143
