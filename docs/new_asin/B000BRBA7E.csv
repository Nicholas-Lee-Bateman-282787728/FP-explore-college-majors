8091333,5,B000BRBA7E,This show met my expectations nicely.,1447027200,,37,5.333333333333333
8091334,3,B000BRBA7E,"At first I was excited about this since first seeing the previews from Noir and Rurouni Kenshin I think. It was something I always wanted to see. Then I started watching it and it kind of let me down. It doesn't develop like most stories, almost being too slow. The short-length episodes don't help much either. It just loses your attention too fast and you get bored.

I'm really sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this to first time anime fans. It's alright to have it in your collection, but it might just sit there collecting dust like my Shura no Toki and Sakura Taisen collections.",1228608000,2,584,4.561904761904762
8091335,3,B000BRBA7E,"This is OK. Above average at best.

The writing relies heavily on one's understanding of Japan's history and culture. The politics and ignorant masses really appeals to those who like to watch the news... or you're typical blue collar worker... but for me... It didn't quite hit the bulls eye.

Not quite what I had hoped for... (I wasn't expecting Hentai... but I had hoped for better character development.)",1177113600,2,409,4.913043478260869
8091336,4,B000BRBA7E,"i didn't know much about this series before i baught it. all i had to go on was the previews from other animes i own. that and the fact that the episodes are alot shorter then usual it seems. but over all i was very pleased with the series. i liked it quite well, and i would recommend it for the avid anime, or even the new anime commers. just don't expect anything in the opening titles or previews to happen as far as the girls are concerned.",1174867200,,445,4.068181818181818
8091337,2,B000BRBA7E,"There's nothing wrong with the series, just that it isn't very exciting. The plot remains monotonous and there's never really a climax or ending. The story begins with three sisters and a god who is bonded to them, and it ends that way too. Nothing extraordinary happens, there's no war, no apocalypse, just the ordinary lives of the girls and their god.",1156636800,7,354,4.725806451612903
8091338,4,B000BRBA7E,"Well, I didn't give it a 5 because they seemed to be making the story as they went.  That's not a bad thing, it just kind a confused me in certain things. Cool story though and Neo Ranga is the man or should I say the god. The action starts a little slow but picks up and a little comidey as well. O and maybe I should mention that if you were to watch this to see the girls in their skimpy clothes and cool weapons, you will never see it unless in the intro of season two which is included.",1152316800,7,491,3.8613861386138613
8091339,5,B000BRBA7E,"Across the ocean on the tiny island kingdom of Barou the acient god Neo Ranga awakens from his slumber. He is mysteriously drawn to Tokyo, and the three beautiful sisters - Minami, Ushio, and Yuuhi - who are unwittingly linked to the monsters. I love the skimpy clothes they wear and the red paint that be's all over their bodies.",1150761600,2,330,4.516666666666667
