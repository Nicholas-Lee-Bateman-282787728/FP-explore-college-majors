8373590,5,B002M78Q28,I fell in love with Dorm Life after watching the first couple episodes. I loved semester one and love semester two. (I can't wait for semester three.) So when I found out Amazon was selling the first semester on DVD I had to have it. Now I know some people are iffy about buying it because you find the episodes online for free. Now I understand thinking like that but the reason I bought the DVD was to support the show and you get to see more bonus features. I thought the DVD cover was awesome and it was shipped to me very quickly. It was a very good price and I am thrilled with my purchase and I am looking forward to buying the second semester when it is on DVD. (Buying it off Amazon of course!),1287705600,,703,4.101449275362318
8373591,5,B002M78Q28,"this show is hilarious. it will definitely remind you of your freshman dorm days, maybe make you even miss them! for fans of the show, I personally think it is worth buying the DVD because now there are a million commercials when you try to watch it online. if you do the play all option you don't have to pause between each short episode. tho i do agree the organization of the extras is a bit weird.

ps. is season 2 ever coming out on dvd?",1286841600,,442,4.1395348837209305
8373592,5,B002M78Q28,"Stumbled onto this online a few years ago and became hooked on the fantastic writing and unique characters.  Awesome show if you like shows such as Arrested Development or How I Met Your Mother. Since everything they offered online was free, felt right to buy this to show support.

Here's hoping for a Season 3!",1279152000,,312,4.654545454545454
8373593,5,B002M78Q28,"Like many college students I found Dorm Life by stumbling around online and what started out as a something just to waste my time, became an obsession that rapidly spread to all of my friends. Like its mock-umentary brother 'The Office', Dorm Life follows a group of college freshman and how they adapt to university life. While the hysterical, yet still relatable, adventures of floor 5 South draw the viewer in it is the wonderfully developed characters that make the show worth watching. Marshall the RA from hell, Steph the perky over doer, Danny B the lovable nerd (who contrary to popular belief does not where glasses), Shane, Gopher, Mike, Brit, Courtney, Josh and Abby, all make the show wildly entertaining and just get better every episode. Endlessly quotable episodes like ""Group Shot"" and ""Finals"" have been interrogated into our everyday vocabulary and are even more fun to watch over and over again on DVD. The extras on the DVD are worth the price especially ""the fort series"" and many webcams that supply many new laughs. I loved this DVD and cannot wait for Season 2 to come out!",1262131200,3,1097,4.809523809523809
8373594,5,B002M78Q28,"I'm going to assume from this point forward that if you are looking at Dorm Life's DVD, you are a fan of the show and want to know why you are spending $20 for something which is 90% available for free online.

First of all, the DVD is very professionally produced. It has a nice outside jacket and good art on the CD. I know this may seem trifling (if you are a huge fan...should this even matter?), but I know that with the Dr. Horrible Sing-Along Blog DVD, the ""homemade"" look was very unappealing to some. This is the complete opposite-Dorm Life's Season 1 DVD fits along with all my other DVD cases and looks great.

The DVD is organized into two cds (Disc 1: Episodes 1-10 and Disc 2: 11-20) with essentially four parts each: the episodes, the webcams, commentaries and the bonus features. One thing, which was disappointing to me, was that the webcams are separated from the episode which they are clearly referencing. The webcams on the website are organized by episode, whereas they are organized by character on the DVD. Personally, I was looking forward to watching all the webcams in one unified swoop (watch the episode, then watch the webcams from that episode). The webcams are such a funny part of the show that it seems strange to relegate them to their own sections. It's partially why I wanted to write this review-I think I would have been happier knowing the organization beforehand, rather than finding out after opening.

Overall, each disc has one character commentary (as in, Mike, Marshall, etc, narrate the episode) and one creator commentary (the real life creators, as in Chris Smith, Brian Singleton, etc narrate the episode and the writing of the episode). Finally, there is some nice bonus material-a very funny Big Brother mini series, an extended version of Josh's play, and of course, bloopers. (Also, if you are really obsessed with Dorm Life-each character has a facebook and a twitter-which is amusing in itself, and kind of an ""extra"", if you haven't checked that out yet).

I really love Dorm Life, so the 60-70 minutes of extra bonus material was really worth it to me. That said, you shouldn't necessarily buy it for the extras-you should buy it for the fact that the DVD makes it so easy to lend to a friend. I know a lot of people are wary of the quality of web shows (""If it's so good, why is it free? why is it on the internet?"" and such), but such a professionally designed DVD would set their mind at ease. So, I fully recommend the Dorm Life Season 1 DVD! Love you floorever, 5 South! We need a third season!",1261872000,15,2557,4.576419213973799
