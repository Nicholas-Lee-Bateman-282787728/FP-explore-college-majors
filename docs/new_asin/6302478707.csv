7827674,5,6302478707,"I remember staying up late and seeing this movie when I was 12 or 13 years old. This movie kind of reminds you how much the adult B-movie industry has changed over the years.  It's too bad that b movies like this are not made anymore. The plot, characters, and choreography is different then what you would see today.
Eventhough it is a low budget film, it does have SUBSTANCE, which some movies today are lacking.",1294272000,,414,4.447368421052632
7827675,5,6302478707,"If this genre had an Oscar, Naked Obsession would have won it for 1991.  This is the best film ever made in this category.  It parodies both politics and religion beautifully.  I can't understand why it hasn't been reissued on DVD as it is a cult classic.",1197590400,4,255,4.382978723404255

Bar none ... this is the best T & A strip club movie ever made., I've dam near seen em all.
You've maybe seen cuts/edits of this movie in other films, also
I believe some say this movie had another title on cable Tv, was it cut there or had different scenes? Anybody know?
The performace of ""Sam Silver"" is awesome and gives me chills.
Was he a guardian angel ? or a temptation to the dark side ? - U decide.
William Kat is very very believable in his role, and excellent performance here. Because of our ""society"" this movie probably hurt his career - when it should have helped him greatly.
The blonde -Maria Ford - its her best role, and one of her earliest. Pre- boob job- she was hotter.
The movie does deliver with some hot sex scenes and full frontal nudity.
Not like todays stuff - which cops out.
I'd kill for a CD of the soundtrack- anybody know if there is one ?, I've looked.
This was one of the last well done ""B movies"" containing sex/nudity
before they all went to really lame sets, actors and etc. in the late 90's.
This movie demands a special ed. DVD, why there isn't one and not even a bare bones DVD release boggles my mind. I'd love to see a sequel- bring back Sam !",1163462400,10,1329,4.175097276264592
