7943916,5,B00005LKHJ,"These days, movies that are Action/Adventure tend to focus more on the ""Action"" and leaves out the ""Adventure"".  What I really liked about this anime is that it has both -- along with a solid story.  In terms of storytelling and pacing, it's a mix between a PRINCESS MONONOKE, NADIA: SECRET OF THE BLUE WATER, and BATTLE ANGEL.  The series itself is not wall-to-wall NINJA SCROLL action, but there's enough action and of different types  -- supernatural powers, swordfights, guns, and aerial dogfighting. It's not the most romantic movie or the most deep, but what's great about it is that it has a little of everything all throughout, which really touches your heart. ARC THE LAD numbers among COWBOY BEBOP, GASARAKI, and NEON GENESIS EVANGELION as one of the few anime series that I have to get the COMPLETE set.",995500800,,814,4.792857142857143
