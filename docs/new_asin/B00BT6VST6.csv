5671353,4,B00BT6VST6,"A well-intentioned little indie movie that winds up breaking down the walls on its way to your heart.  Good to see Ben Savage and Jake Busey in classic acting form.  Not to mention, Anna Pheil is some serious eye candy!  By the end, this movie will make you want to star in your own love story.",1408147200,4,294,4.214285714285714
5671354,5,B00BT6VST6,"It's cute and romantic! And it's very nice seeing Ben Savage in something. I heard he went to college after ""boy meets world."" But it looks like he's back again! And that's pretty cool :D",1393545600,5,187,4.371428571428571
5671355,5,B00BT6VST6,Great date night movie! My Hubby and I laughed (and I also cried).. Don't understand the R rating there was no nudity or anything just a couple F words. The characters were really quit witted and funny.  This quickly moved to  being one of our fav movies!,1386028800,2,255,4.404255319148936
5671356,3,B00BT6VST6,"Fun movie to watch, for an independent move on a low budget the writer, director and actors did a great job. Liked the original title much better (Peace and Riot)",1377388800,2,162,4.433333333333334
5671357,4,B00BT6VST6,"We really enjoyed the movie. It will never win awards, but we found it very entertaining. Anna Pheil is not only cute, but she is very natural and believable. Hope we see more of her.",1373068800,4,183,4.257142857142857
5671358,3,B00BT6VST6,"I would have loved to give this more stars. However, it is a very low-budget picture. The acting is passable, but not great (with the exception of Anna Pheil, who gives a stellar performance). The plot is simple. For these reasons, it might normally rate one star, maybe two.
However, this movie has a lot of heart, and it is very genuine. It is, simply, just a sweet movie about two strangers meeting at a cabin, followed by 75 or so minutes of getting to know each other.
Again, not a great movie, but one that is certainly not pretentious, and doesn't try too hard. It also certainly doesn't go ""over the top"" as so many low budget movies do. It stays real from start to finish.
Another thing I really like about this movie is that, as of this writing, there are no other reviews of this movie on this site. It is extremely common for people involved in low-budget movies to create their own ""reviews"" on this site. All of the cast, crew, and friends of the cast and crew give their movie five stars (naturally). It's pretty obvious that this is what's going on, because, if you click on their ""See all my reviews"" links, the movie they're rating is the only thing they have ever rated.
So, again, the fact that no one associated with this movie has gone onto this site and created fake reviews of their own movie is another testament to the integrity of the people involved in this movie. And, as noted earlier, this integrity comes through in the movie itself.",1370390400,17,1465,4.449814126394052

He's just a normal guy trying to write a book when she shows up with her guitar and amps. Needless to say, the musical ramblings trying to write a new hit song don't go well with the quiet solitude needed to write a book. But they work it out as they get to know each other. I really like the way the confrontations were handled without childish angst. This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be when I started watching it.",1473552000,,554,4.235849056603773

Story up to the point I signed off was... utterly unbelievable. And trite.

Add in the man of my dreams from the 90's and it seems like an equation for success. Wrong. I could have made a better movie with my iPhone and sock puppets. I didn't watch far into the movie because it was physically painful to watch. To start, the lead actress cannot sing well. Whoever told her she could and offered her this role without offering someone else to provide vocals, did her a great disservice. At one point, Ben Stiller is typing his novel on the computer and they continue to zoom in and nothing is being typed on the computer. I don't understand why they continuely zoom in on the screen if your going to not actually have him time. It was so awfully made that I couldn't get past that point.

5671510,3,B00BT6VST6,"This isn't a bad movie to watch or half watch while on a relaxed afternoon or while winding down for the night. The script is pretty rough but the actors do what they can. Honestly the weakest links of this movie are Damion Stephens (writer/director) and Anna Pheil (Crystal). There are some cuts that either just linger too long or just don't quite fit the scene or movie at all. The camera work itself is pretty painful near the beginning but improves drastically as the movie goes on. Pheil's portrayal is pretty uneven throughout the movie. I am not certain if it is her acting or the way the character is written but there are times she seems to be like a deer caught in headlights. However, her sincerity and charm make her a very likable character throughout the movie. Honestly the two best things about this movie are Janet Wood and Richard Riehle as the older married couple. Their delivery is spot on when the script allows for it and just awkward when the script is beyond resuscitation, which thankfully for them isn't very often.

Overall with all the cons, the movie is still entertaining and pretty honest to itself. It isn't going for over the top performances or antics to make itself stand out. It is just a low budget movie about subtlety and subtext. The emotional progression of things seem rushed and exaggerated but to aide the plot it is forgivable. The very last scene is odd but honest to things in keeping a very impromptu love story in perspective but I wish it had shown a more optimistic view to balance everything out.

Just watch, appreciate it for what it is, and just remember, it isn't Hemingway.",1433548800,4,1632,4.6048109965635735

5671512,5,B00BT6VST6,"Just saw this abomination on the CW and am still stunned by it's awfulness.  I have nothing against any of the actors involved, but did they lose a bet or something?  This seems more like someone's half-baked school project than a real movie.  The camerawork, editing, dialogue and direction are all vying against each other to see which is the clunkiest.  The production value falls somewhere between a Mexican soap and beta porn.  The whole thing's shot on some sort of hi-def video which gives it a cable access feel.  Jake Busey usually plays a smartass in every other low-rent comedy; here, he's deadly serious and horribly miscast.  The rising star rocker girl has no discernible musical talent. Ben Savage looks completely lost.  This thing is actually so bad that it's fascinating.  Why does it exist?  Why was it released?  Who funded it?  I can imagine some poor ""Boy Meets World"" fan returning it to their local Redbox with a look of bewilderment and sadness on their face.
