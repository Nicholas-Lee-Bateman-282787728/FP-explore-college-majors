728778,5,6303682952,"This is simply a gem of a movie based on Howard Fast's excellent 1962 novel,( which I still have), of the first day of hostilities between colonists and Britain.
There may have been bigger blockbusters made about the American Revolution (The Patriot, Revolution etc) but to me this under- rated 1988 film is a true classic, capturing the quintessential decency of American colonial village life in Lexington and the developing tensions and conflict on that fateful day of 19th April 1775.
I agree with the 2 previous reviewers that this film is a great teaching tool. It shows many things: the tensions and love in family life, particularly between  Moses Cooper ( Tommy Lee Jones) and his son Adam ( Chad Lowe),who is no longer a boy yet not quite a man; romance between Adam and Ruth Simmons ( played by the lovely Susan Blakely); different generations and how they relate to each other; the underlying strong Christian faith of the era,( which still prevails in American life today); the need to perform civic duties; and culture and costumes far removed from our own period etc.
""April Morning"" is also effective because it does not glamourise war or demonise the redcoats. In fact both Adam and a young redcoat are both seen, at various stages, to be scared witless by the whiff of 'grapeshot' and of battle. Yet overall, in what is truly a momentous day for Adam personally, (as well as the villagers of Lexington and Concord), we see how the events mature him and this is brilliantly illustrated at the end of the film when he leads his family in prayer for their food and life. This very subtle approach makes it evident that the boy, like colonial America, has gone for ever and has been replaced by a decent man who would,with humility, be worthy of his emerging new leadership role-as would America.
As a non-American I conclude by saying that any American who fails to appreciate this film simply lacks a soul and an understanding of the greatness of American history - a fact which was demonstrated on that dusty Lexington-Concord road 226 years ago- and by the makers of this film who have created another very special ""April Morning"".",998438400,110,2149,4.745989304812834

729119,1,6303682952,"simple minded, overly dramatized propaganda.  great movie for your kids to watch - it will exactly mirror their history lessons.  If there was supposed to be some morality lesson here other than pure, raw, greatest country ever patriotism - the directors and writers missed it totally. The boy who shot a British soldier, not much older than him, and saw the fear in the soldier's face - was a slight - perhaps not even intended - portrait of the horror of man killing man (in this case - boy killing boy) - in war.  However, the producers, director, writers simply opted for the simple minded, black and white, good vs evil portrayal of an extremely complex phenomenon called the America Revolution.  Good vs evil. God is on our side.  Our founding was much more complicated, and much more meaningful. But, I guess the truth of it would be too much of a challenge for movie screen writers and directors and too boring for our modern day public.",1467504000,,945,4.634730538922156

Tommy Lee Jones did a good turn as did Robert Uric and Susan Blakely.  Pretty stock story, young boy stands with dad and other neighbors against the Lobster Backs on April 19, 1775.

729238,5,6303682952,"A movie worth seeing twice, which I did, and if its available to buy, I will. Returns you to the earliest days of American freedom in a terribly exciting way. The British arrive early in this film, trudging the roads to confiscate muskets and powder squirreled away by the Colonists, who's tavern meetings are ending with increasingly violent intent. The stand on Lexington Green is the best it's ever been done, the chaos that coalesces men on the barbarous and bloody road as Patriots attack British columns really packs a bang for the buck. Laced with knowing bits of historical lifestyle, our verdict is this is the film The Patriot wanted to be.

If you saw this a year or more ago, I believe they upgraded the print to HD, because it looks really great. Tommy Lee Jones is awesome, and the story moves very fast. Why not -- its by Howard Fast, the author who wrote Spartacus.",1461024000,,881,4.575949367088608

The movie stayed true to the book and I thought Chad Lowe was exceptionally good.  It's a fictionalized piece of history, but the depiction of ""the shot heard round the world"" was a fairly accurate account of what actually happened.

729710,2,6303682952,"While I detest Howard Fast's literature, it must be said that this movie faithfully follows much of his prose-- including his historical errors. The movie is built around a shallow, sappy ""coming of age"" story set in Lexington, MA a day or so prior to the famous fight on April 19, 1775. Except for the actor Rip Torn, who does a somewhat credible job, the acting and dialog is generally wooden and unengaging. Despite the director's best efforts, the film abounds in historical errors: the Lexington men are armed with a motley assortment of rifles, post revolutionary war guns, and poorly made props; the British troops on the Common include ""hat companies"" and grenadiers (only light infantry fought at Lexington); the houses and ""Buckman's Tavern"" are generally poor renditions of the hundred-year old houses that surrounded the common; the speaking light infantry actor had no idea how to handle a flintlock; the stone walls the flank the roadway are obvious props; there were no leaves on the trees on April 19; Paul Revere's part is very underplayed and William Dawes is absent; the passage of time indicated by the characters rarely matches the background lighting... Etc., etc., etc. despite its many failings, the action in the Lexington Common is almost reasonable and the action along the Boston Road (today's ""Battle Road"") conveys some of the losses, confusion, and terror suffered by the British troops and their officers. In many ways, this is a bad movie...however for enthusiasts of the April 19 fighting, ""April Morning"" is thus far the only game in town. And, amazingly, portions of this movie are truer to the historical record than much later efforts by the Discovery Channel, History Channel, and others.",1439769600,5,1727,5.041958041958042

729714,3,6303682952,"The movie for me is something less than 3 stars.  Nothing horrible just kinda hokey ... Except that in the staging and recreation of the confrontation at Lexington Green and later with the British troops hurrying back to Boston I was able to see some well-worn history in a clear light. In particular in a profoundly short period of time the balance shifted from Brits with overwhelming force at the Green to the Brits rushing to get back to Boston, away from a larger, armed, and growing force of colonials.  I'd heard it all before, but seeing it well recreated on the screen it really made it clear how powerful a force the colonists became when more and more streamed in from the surrounding region. ***** 5-stars to the folks who staged the battle scenes!",1438819200,,760,4.622222222222222

This movie gets it right, the way it must have felt, the moment when anger at Parliament and the king turned into bullets fired, gun smoke stinging your eyes, exhilaration, and terror at the realization of the corner that'd been turned.

730073,3,6303682952,"I had seen ""April Morning"" several years ago for the first time, and now wished to refresh my memory of the dramatization of this iconic, American historical event.  I was again moved by the father-son relationship in the early part of the movie, as portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones and Chad Lowe.  The movie changed at the historical point of confrontation with the British troops at Lexington, where it tried to become an action movie from then on.  It also became less convincing as a dramatic portrayal.  Battle scenes require sweeping maneuvers across swaths of landscape and horrific depictions of men at war.  ""April Morning"" made attempts at those energetic encounters, but they appeared ""low budget"" and more like arbitrary vignettes.  This was particularly noticeable with the extras who played ""lobster backs,"" and ""redcoats,"" overweight, under or over-aged fellows who couldn't possibly have passed even an 18th century army physical.  And the presence of Rip Torn has to be mentioned.  His acting exuberance coupled with the oddity of his character did certainly lend a spark to the story when he appeared on the screen.

730143,5,6303682952,"A wonderful movie.  I can't think of a better one on the American Revolution, though ""The Patriot"" and ""The Crossing"" and a few others have some very good points. I had ""April Morning"" on tape for years and was very happy when it showed up on Amazon Instant.
  What is great about it is that it deals with things that are usually not covered in the few movies (and few documentaries for that matter), and that is the people who actually fought that war.  I've seen documentaries about John Adams and Benjamin Franklin and George Washington.  Those are very good, but they're not about those who filled the ranks.
  This one covers the first battle, the beginning of the war, the Battle of Lexington and Concord, outside of Boston, Massachusetts.
  The movie has the look and feel of the times:  the tensions between the two sides; the simple village with unpainted wooden walls; the farmers and blacksmiths and the women who hold the families together.  One of the things a good movie can provide that a book cannot is the images and sounds that make up life.
  We see the disagreements, not only between British troops and colonials, but also between the colonials.  Not all of them were convinced they should fight or even could fight the British Army.  They were only farmers and simple folk, after all.  But the disagreement with the king was very strong, perhaps more so in the northern colonies and that did play a major role in what happened.
  The farmers were up against a professional army, but that army was moving into very hostile territory.  The soldiers' mission was to march to Concord to destroy arms that the colonial militia was gathering in preparation for war.  The militia, still uncertain what to do, gathered on the green in Lexington to confront the British troops, who were passing through on their way to Concord.  A shot was fired by someone, just who did that is not known, then the troops fired.  The debates on the colonial side were not at an end, but the debate over fighting was.  The war was on.
  The movie has fictionalized elements:  a local man fires the ""shot heard round the world"", the characters language is as much 20th as 18th Century, but those are minor quibbles.  They do capture the spirit and the times very well.  We see people going about their lives in ways that did exist then:  a father trying to raise his son as he thinks he should; boy and girl going out in the evening to hold hands (pretty liberal for those times); hard work on the farm and endless chores; the musket hanging over the fireplace, a common sight in farming communities of the time; debates over superstitions, the prayers recited before, during and after the battle.
  And much more.  A good historical story should take you back to those times and put you in with those people; this movie does that very well indeed.",1410652800,4,2843,4.612774451097804

730146,5,6303682952,"I read the book first and found that the scriptwriters of this film changed very little of the plot in Howard Fast's book.  Each of the actors were well-matched to the character they played.  I also found the location this film was sort of remarkable, because both Lexington and Concord have undergone the urban changes of today as the City of Boston expanded its boundaries in the last two centuries since these events unfolded.  The film's 86-minute running time could have been longer, but then some alteration of Fast's book would also have had to be undertaken.  All details in the film were exactly accurate; the clothing (I do not like the term ""costumes""), the weapons, the everyday household utensils, i.e. flatware, wooden plates, candle-holders, kitchen fireplace, etc.  About the only thing that I noticed being out of sink was the men's hair.  Average men wore their hair long and tied back in such a way that it hung down the back of the neck to the length of a foot, but not tied close to the head, lest it be a ponytail.  Some extras had the correct hair style, but Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Ulrich, and Rip Torn had regular 1980s style haircuts.  Chad Lowe started out with a short tail of hair tied back, but later on in the film, his hair was flying in the wind.  Overall, I thought this film is a really wonderful one that was well-done.",1409702400,,1355,4.566115702479339

Tommy Lee Jones plays a critical, somewhat cynical father, and Ulrich, the neighbor.  The events of Lexington and Concord do come more alive with the microscope we use to see the high standards the father sets for his son, the frustration of the son, but ultimately how it all no longer matters when the decision of the British commander to march brings it all to a head.

Farmers, blacksmiths, shop keepers- they really didn't want the fight.  Most were simply trying to get about their lives.  But events truly escalated, in some ways, beyond their control.  And they fought.  Some died.

To raise well adjusted children in the harsh culture it takes a lot of caring adults to make sure they tread into the teen years only one small step at a time.

730427,2,6303682952,"Firstly, this was made for TV movie back in the early 80's. I remember watching it when I was a kid. The story line follows a young man coming of age during the fateful days surrounding the battle of Lexington and Concord. The film is as accurate in the tale as any, I would guess. I do agree that the time of year looks to be in the summer not early spring as one person mentioned in a review. This would only be a not pick, however it just goes to the problem with the film. It starts out with bad acting and it ends with bad acting. There are flashes of authenticity and shining examples of in depth character development, however for the most part the dialogue is flat and uninteresting. I don't necessarily hate the film, and if my kids wanted to watch something about the revolutionary war this would be a wholesome offering. I personally will probably never turn it on again for my own viewing.",1376265600,3,901,4.337278106508876

This excellent movie presents the Battle of Lexington mostly thru the eyes of a boy not quite 16.  It is a day that turns his life upside down, and forces him to grow up in a hurry.  Moreover, the issues for which they went so reluctantly to war are still at issue today.

It particularly does a good job describing the confrontation on the Lexington Green and the ""hit and run"" fighting of the patriots as the British returned from Concord to Boston(Charleston). A couple well known actors do a nice job, particularly Tommy Lee Jones.

730548,4,6303682952,"Movies made from novels rarely do the novel justice.  In the case of April Morning, the movie does live up to its predecessor (written by Howard Fast), and in some places improves upon the story.
April Morning is a story that takes place over the course of about 24 hours.  The story focuses on two Lexington families, the Coopers and the Simmons, and how the ""Shot Heard Round the World"" affects their lives.  The director chose to narrow the focus of the story and omitted some of the characters from the book.  The story is mainly about the coming of age of Adam Cooper, a 15 year old boy who thinks that being allowed to join the Lexington militia will be the greatest day of his life.
Adam's father, Moses, is a strict man, who has the habit of being very honest with God in prayer.  He tells Adam later that he is hard on Adam because he wants him to grow up strong.  He does not believe that men should tell their sons that they love them, but through eavesdropping on his parents' conversation, Adam is reassured of his father's love.  This is important, since Moses will be a casualty of the shots fired on the green.  Adam will have to continue on in the fight with Mr. Simmons and other men from the Lexington militia.
The Simmons family is more overtly loving to each other than the Cooper family and Adam appears to be courting Ruth Simmons.  Ruth keeps the proper relationship boundaries with Adam, and has a very godly character.  This is a ""kissing book"", which might be a little embarrassing for students if the movie is shown in the classroom.  Eighth grade students don't seem to mind that very much.
Adam spends the rest of the day with Mr. Simmons, who acts as a father figure to Adam.  The story does portray how Adam feels like a coward when he runs from the green, and how hard it is for him to shoot another person.  Mr. Simmons gives him comfort and fatherly advice to help him through that day.
The movie is TV PG, and was made to be family friendly.  It does not accurately portray the horror and the bloodshed of that April day, which is more vivid in the book.  If someone is looking for a more accurate portrayal of the fighting, The Patriot is a better choice, but that movie is too violent for younger teens in an unedited version.  April Morning does capture the emotions Adam has to process, starting the day with the boyish attitude of a great adventure and ending the day disheveled, weary, and wiser.
The last scene is especially well written.  Adam, sitting in his father's place at the table at the evening meal, stops in the middle of his childish rote prayer and becomes very honest with God.  This movie is recommended for middle school students who are studying the Revolutionary War.  Told through the eyes of a fifteen year old, it gives teens an idea of how it would feel to be in that situation.",1353456000,42,2843,4.443159922928709
730629,5,6303682952,"May not be 100% historically accurate in the course of the events, but it gives a good feel of the period.

The VHS copy that I made during its first (only?) broadcast on Halmark's Hall of Fame is just about worn out from repeat viewing.

It gives one an appreciation of those non-professional soldiers who grabbed their muskets and became warriors - not to preserve freedom (colonials were not free), but to ESTABLISH FREEDOM for themselves as well as future generations. What courage it must have taken for simple farmers, merchants, and blacksmiths to resist the world's most formidable army!

One assumes the film is historically correct. However it perhaps should have been shot during the time of year when the depicted events occurred (The countryside in Massachusetts is not lush and green in April).

Nevertheless, April Morning is a keeper; it stirred an interest in that part of our history and compelled me to visit Lexington and Concord, and to walk Battle Road. It is highly recommended.",1341273600,4,818,5.097014925373134

The sub-plot of young love blooming on the eve of revolution is powerful, as well as the father-son relationship that heals in the course of the story. The filming is beyond reproach. The only place this movie loses the authenticity that I prize is that many of the actresses in non-pivotal roles are wearing WAY too much makeup. The main characters don't appear to wear makeup at all, although they may be for the sake of filming, which of course would be normal for folks living then.

730637,5,6303682952,"I collect historical movies.  And, I collect Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.  This is a HHofF movie & yet NOWHERE is there even a hint of that!  Hallmark Hall of Fame movies have certain elements that remain year after year after year.  First, they start with a good story.  In this case, it is the story of the role of the town of Lexington in the beginning of the American Revolution.  Lexington was a small town back them.  When the men of the town gathered on the village green, there were less than 100 gathered.  I don't really know how far it is from Boston proper.  The second thing common to HHofF productions are the absence of violence, blood-shed, swering & sexuality.  If these are necessary for the story, the amount of time the viewer is exposed to these is very brief, or referred to in the dialog.  HHofF often chooses well-known talent for the leading roles, but not always & finally, the movies are made to air in a 2-hour time slot - always a Sunday evening, on CBS, with commercial breaks.  When you choose a HHofF movie, these things you can count on.  You will be told a good story & it will be told in a 2-hour time slot.  In the case of this movie Robert Urick & Tommy Lee Jones are cast as fathers of teenage children in Lexington & Chad Lowe is cast as a teenage boy who becomes a man.  He doesn't do this because he wants to, but because of circumstance.  He sees his father get shot.  He is torn between feelings of guilt over his actions as being those of a coward versus survival tactics, when he runs to shed & stays there.

There was a time that Hallmark didn't secure the rights for distribution of their films.  That is not the case today.  I got my copy from a friend/correspondent at Hallmark headquarters in Kansas City.  You teachers out there - write to Hallmark.  You should be able to find the address.  Tell them you are needing a copy for school use.  I'll bet they would send it to you free of charge.  My copy has the words ""free copy, not for asle"" on the label.  There is no fancy artwork on the cover.  But, it's the movie that is important, after all.

Bottom line - would I recommend this film to a friend?  Yes!  Definataly yes!  I disagree with the reviewer who wrote this is nothing but a ""soap opera"".  Sure there is a little chemistry/magnetism between the teenagers in this film.  Neither one did anything dishonorable.  They kissed - once & it was very short & sweet.  They were two young people starting the journey to love.",1309910400,,2481,4.342794759825328
730638,5,6303682952,"I am a collector.  One thing I collect is Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.  I have as many of them as I can find - Hallmark Gold Crown Edition or ""street copies"" - in VHS format or DVD format.  I got a large number of titles in the Fall of 2010, when Hallmark had a clearance sale of VHS titles.  They were brand-new & sealed & sold really cheap.  At some point in the past, HHofF started securing distribution rights to its movies.  This one, unfortunately for them, was not one they got those rights for.  I got my copy from a friend/correspondent at Hallmark.  The copy was taped off-air, commercials & all & then duplicated for free copies to be distributed by Hallmark.  When a new Hallmark movie airs, I record - off air, the current movie & watch it later.  We still have VHS format in just about every room that has a TV.  This DVD was just as if I had done that, except it was in DVD format.  I don't know how many copies of this movie they have ""in the files"".  Teachers - write to Hallmark Hall of Fame & tell them you are needing a copy for school use.

I have read most of the reviews posted on Amazon for the VHS version of this film, before my copy was delivered to my mailbox.  I agree with the teachers who are using this movie in Social Studies classes.  I think the film is largely, historically accurate.  I like the choices of actors & actresses they chose with Robert Urick & Tommy Lee Jones playing roles of fathers of teenage children in Lexington.  Chad Lowe was also a good choice for the character of one of the teenagers.  It is the story of one small community that had the role of the site of the start of the Revolution.  I eagerly awaited delivery of this title & it is an excellent film.  I think it might even have been filmed in the actual area of that beginning battle.  From where I live, Lexington is about a 45 minute drive on the highway.  It is amazing how very close to Boston it is! and yet, back then, it was a large distance by horse!

Bottom line: would I recommend it to a friend? YES! Definately Yes!",1309910400,5,2045,4.184615384615385
730728,5,6303682952,"This movie is outstanding! It was totally fascinating to watch the movie and the time just flew by. The handling of the story and the actors chosen to play the roles resulted in a powerful presentation that should be watched by every American who loves this country and values its heritage.

It was one of those movies that left the viewer wanting more; I was ready to keep going and see what happened next in the lives of those Americans who had so quickly become important to me. The story focuses on the life of a young boy, Adam Cooper, played by Chad Lowe, who is teetering on the edge of manhood and the impact of his suddenly being thrust into the beginning of a war which would influence the rest of his life.

The young woman in his life, a neighbor's daughter named Ruth Simmons, is beautifully played by Meredith Salenger with an innocence and purity that is very touching. Ruth's father, played by Robert Urich, brings authority and strength to the role of Joseph Simmons as does Tommy Lee Jones as Moses Cooper, Adam's father.

The story illustrates how suddenly and irreversibly life can be changed by events beyond our control; the loving efforts of a devoted father who is trying to help his son develop into a strong, capable human being must all be set aside when events overtake them like a powerful tsunami.

Chad Lowe is to be commended for his touching and effective portrayal of Adam Cooper; this is a performance that will not be soon forgotten!

730731,4,6303682952,"This is a decent film that deserves to be re-issued on DVD.  While not a big budget opus like infamous Mel Gibson's THE PATRIOT, this is a much higher quality film overall.  While a bit slow in the beginning with family relationships in Lexington, the film picks up when the British at last appear on the screen!  There is a nice shot of the British columm deploying impressively into line to face Captain Parker's company.  The only problem here is that the British force at this point consisited of six companies of Light Infantry who jogged into town at a fast clip before forming line opposite the militia.  This would have been less impressive to show, plus i guess the available re-enactors could not all be shown in Light Infantry garb.  So we get the usual mix of line companies, Grenadiers and Lights all in group together!  Colorful, but not accurate!

The confrontation on Lexington Green is made out to be the fault of a renegade Irishman who fires the mysterious first shot of the Revolution.  This guy seems like an IRA Fenian several generations ahead of his time!  None the less it provides an excuse for how the war began.  The British are shown rather impersonally. The officers dry and slightly arrogant.  It would have been nice to have expounded more on their circumstances in the beginning of the film.  Major Pitcarrin of the Royal Marines for example was universally admired by rebels in Boston for his firm, but fair manner.

The battle scenes are none the less exciting and well done.  While the Americans are shown doing their thing from behind cover popping away at the red-coats, the British Lights are also depicted as countering their moves with skirmesher tactics.  On the whole this is well done.  The fatigue the British column starts to suffer is well portrayed.  Again, we should have only Grenadiers and Light Infantry since these were the collected elite companies brought together for this mission.  The tri-corned hat men of the line should only be shown coming up with Lord Percy later on.  Still, this is a relatively minor detail which most not familier with the British army of the 18th century will not notice (or care about).

The acting is well done overall, Tommy Lee Jones seems way out of place here in a period movie.  One keeps expecting him to reveal his under cover cop badge or something!  Still, the plot and acting work to create a decent film about the early days of the Revolution.  Deffinitely one of your better American Rev War flicks.

730732,4,6303682952,"This film is set in 1775 Colonial Massachusetts. A peddler is stopped and searched, the British troops find a musket, powder, balls and confiscate them and the wagon (Gun Control!). The peddler stops at a local tavern to tell about this. The people have noticed an increase in British troop patrols. We then meet a family and see a portrayal of life in the 18th century as similar to today. There is a meeting among the men, they discuss the relative military strengths of the Colonial militia to the 5,000 British troops in Boston. [In fact the militia had a long military experience in colonial warfare, the British were less experienced.]

A rider gives the alarm: the British are coming to seize the guns and ammunition stored at Concord where the Continental Congress is meeting. The local militia is summoned by the ringing of the church bell. They are drawn up peaceably on the village green as for their regular drill. They did not block the road or threaten the British. The British order them to disperse. A shot rings out, and the battle ends in a rout. Then the troops reform to march to Concord. [Later the British officers claimed they did not order an attack on the villagers, as if to deny any guilt or responsibility for attacking the militia.] This battle of Lexington was just a minor diversion, but gave time for the Minutemen to prepare at Concord for the shot heard around the world.

The British reached Concord, but the guns and ammunition had been moved away. When they began their return to Boston the Minutemen from all the surrounding towns followed and kept up continual fire upon the British. The patriots used their well-tried tactics practiced for generations in forest fighting. After the British retreated to Boston the militia surrounded them and took the hills overlooking the town. The battle of Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill) did not dislodge them. When cannon were brought in the British fleet abandoned Boston. [Mike Wright's book tells how a supply wagon was captured in Lexington.]

The end of the French and Indian War led to new and heavy taxes on the 13 colonies and a ban on some prior rights. The Boston Tea Party was followed by heavy sanctions on Boston (yet none betrayed those ""Indians"" who committed an illegal act). The taxation worsened. Committees of Correspondence were formed in the colonies to seek a common front. They prepared to defend themselves. The Congress at Concord became a target for the British. So they marched there to capture the leaders. This film presents a dramatic view of those times, as seen by the people. [I think it is better than Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"".] John Galvin's book explains this best. The Minutemen were those militia men who were best fitted to muster at a minute's notice, a part of the militia. In 1774 the Massachusetts militia were first to practice the democratic election of officers (a practice that lasted until WW I). The morale of the volunteers was part of their effectiveness.",1152576000,6,2981,4.807017543859649

Lovely scenery. Weapons and costumes appear authentic. Buildings need a little work. Interior shots good. Acting and diolog need a little work.

Overall a Soap Opera.

Really not very impressed with what looks more like a work of revisionism than anything authentic. The Americans appear blood thirsty and looking for trouble. They appear to lack any semblence of militery organization or fighting doctrine. Historicly those are proven far from the truth. Over a third of New England's male population were veterans of the previous war and had generations of combat experience fighting the French and the indians.

We start just before the rider shows up with the warnings.  I have a typed synopsis of the events leading up to this and explain the tensions of frontier warfare experience, womens' issues vs the male ego, and that this is a MOVIE based on the events.  However, the use of reenactors, authentic clothing, and armaments make it somewhat more appealing.  Rip Torn's aggression played against the desire to reason things out to prevent war are universal themes that really get the Language  Arts teachers smiling with writing prompts for opinion papers.  I wish it was rereleased to get the price down.  My ancestors were Loyalist Rangers who, along with their Iroquois allies, didn't play ""fairly"" and had to bug out to Britain and Ontario in 1781.  It is interesting to the students how young the British soldier is and his confusion under stress is typical of most newbies throughout history.  The disagreement of the British officers at the green to ""force"" the crown's authority or just march by such a small underarmed group has been documented.  If the movie is prepped and guided with thoughtful questioning it usually becomes one of the students' favorites.  I find it great fun to have intuitive kids ask if I was technically a ""Redcoat"" as a Marine in Danang.  I smile and respond that I was loyal to my ""king"" and ""country"" but, like the young fusilier in the movie, I was often just as concerned.",1104796800,10,1559,4.772388059701493
730736,3,6303682952,"April Morning is a historical fiction soap opera loved in great big portions by N. Lampi.  (Une lampe for short)  He made us watch this movie and I was shocked at how EVIL the British appeared to be.  However, this movie was very soap opera-like.  For example, the main character (Adam Cooper) said, ""FATHER, WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO!"" I found that very funny and TOO dramatic.  Also, it maybe hard to remember *cough*test*cough* but at the end Adam receives his father's watch.  WATCH!  w-a-t-c-h!!! Remember that!!!  Oh well.  Thus, this movie gets 3/5 stars.  Some talking people *cough*J. Reeves III*cough* ruined it by talking!  OH well......",1007942400,2,644,4.87037037037037
