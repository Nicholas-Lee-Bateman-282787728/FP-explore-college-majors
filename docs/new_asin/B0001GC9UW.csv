8012375,1,B0001GC9UW,"This is one of those skating DVD's that is designed to maximize profit for the producer, while giving the buyer very little in return.  Only 60 minutes of coverage???

Save your money and find the skating clips on you tube instead.  I would personally buy skating DVD's if they actually had commentary, narration (such as the history of skating), and some extras, but this is ridiculous.",1312588800,3,387,4.833333333333333
8012376,4,B0001GC9UW,I was very pleased with this DVD. Practically all of the performances were in their entirety. I look forward to getting Volume 2 and hopefully it will be as good as Volume 1.,1268179200,3,174,4.303030303030303
8012377,1,B0001GC9UW,"Both volumes 1 and 2 are a major ripoff. There is less than one hour of film on each DVD, which could hold 6 hours or more. The clips are short and only show part of the performances. Most of the DFD is blather from the commentators. I was so disappointed I almost cried. Where is Sasha Cohen, the greatest skater who ever lived?",1243814400,6,329,4.15625
8012378,2,B0001GC9UW,"I agree with most of the reviewers--it would have been nice to have a menu and be able to click through the performances to see a particular skater. I wonder if the producers made it first for video and then just recorded it on DVD without any changes.
Truly, forwarding through the DVD would be great for my daughter. She's a figure skater and wants to analyze different performances.

What was really frustrating was the way they built up the two Carmens (Katerina Witt and Debi Thomas), but didn't show much of Debi's performance. It would have been nice to compare the two.",1205884800,11,577,4.601941747572815
8012379,4,B0001GC9UW,"I disagree with the other 2 reviewers. You don't buy videos just to have nice chapters, but rather to watch the performances; who cares about fast fowarding? This set has the complete long programs--without commentary--of many skaters, even hard-to-find perfomances like those from the 1980s and earlier. The only snippets are of those of Dick Button, Debi Thomas and Sonja Henie. The quality of the video is very good, and the music is clear. My main criticism is the lack of Russians included in the collection; it's mostly North Americans. I'd also have liked more pairs & ice dancers. But overall, it's a nice collection for skating fans, and allows you to see the changes in the sport over the last few decades.",1135987200,52,716,4.829268292682927
8012380,3,B0001GC9UW,"I was thrilled to get this DVD of performances but it's disappointing that there's no menu and you can't simply go to one performance. Still, the viewer gets a great overview of historical moments in the sport and epic performances from figure skating's greatest champions.",1127692800,29,273,5.088888888888889
8012381,1,B0001GC9UW,"I bought this DVD because I love to watch figure skaters. I have many of the performances on this DVD on old video tapes, but wanted them all in one DVD, so I'd have them in one place, easily indexed, so I could find each performance without having to fast forward. Well, was I mistaken. This so-called DVD is actually more a video CD. There are no extras, and there isn't a menu. They didn't even put chaptering on the thing so you could skip to the beginning of each performance, so I'm still stuck fast-forwarding through the DVD to get to what I want to watch. And splitting the set into two volumes was just a way for the greedy to scam more money. Both volumes would easily have fit on one DVD, with room to spare for extras that weren't included. I gave this one star because Amazon doesn't give an option for zero stars. It really deserved a negative one.",1088899200,106,863,4.300613496932515
