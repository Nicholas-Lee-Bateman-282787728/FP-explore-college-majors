This movie is one of my favorites from the great Italian filmmaker.  Jennifer Connelly is great and you see why she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today, let's hope she stays away from Dark Water type pics though.  I would HIGHLY recommend this film to any horror fan.  I don't own it but it will be the crown jewel of my Dario Argento Collection.  When I first saw it, I won't lie, that little boy freaked me out, it really shocked me and that is saying a lot.",1135555200,2,616,4.213675213675214

799640,4,6304132328,"Released as ""Creepers"" and cut by almost 30 minutes in the US in 1985, Dario Argento's ""Phenomena"" is presented in it's full running time of 110 minutes and is uncut. Anchor Bay again does a great job in transferring on to DVD with sharp sound and crystal clear picture. While some fans and many critics find it to be Argento's worst effort it is one of my favorite films by him.

While ""Phenomena"" isn't close to Argento's masterpieces ""Suspiria"" and ""Deep Red"" and not nearly as good as ""Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" or ""Tenebre"" I don't believe it to be his worst film.

Jennifer Connely plays Jennifer, a girl who is sent to a boarding school while her father is out of the country working on a film. Unfortunately for Jennifer and the other girls in the school there is a raving psychopath wandering the grounds and butchering the students. When Jennifer meets up with entomologist Dr. John McGregor, played by the late, great, Donald Pleasance (Halloween) she learns of her great power to control insects. If she is going to survive and save the other girls in the process she'll have to learn how to use her gift to stop the killer.

 While the dialogue is trite and the acting is sub par, like all other Argento films, you have to be appreciative of his style, sense of atmosphere and his stylish killings which all Argento fans have come to know and love. He puts the ""Gore in gorgeous"". If you've never seen an Argento film I would suggest seeing ""Deep Red"" or ""Suspiria"" first to get a sense of his style. Seasoned Argento fans shouldn't be too disappointed but shouldn't expect too much either.",1089849600,5,1608,4.592334494773519

799642,3,6304132328,"I want to start this review with a personal story. When I was in elementary school, I saw ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" starring Diane Keaton. Keaton was naked, I was in love. I was a movie buff, even back then, so I decided to write my own movie. It was called ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar 2,"" in which Keaton's character survived her stabbing, and kept sleeping with other men. This dramatic milestone ran eight pages, in screenplay form, and I was very proud of my sophisticated use of the F word throughout. Then I showed it to my dad...I did not try another screenplay until I was in college, and it still sucked.
Why the story? First, this will serve as proof that I thought up the idea for Goodbar 2 if Hollywood tries it (anything's possible, just look at ""Species II""). This also draws an analogy to the script for ""Creepers."" ""Creepers"" is one of the most juvenile-written movies of our time.
Argento is such a good director, there are scary scenes here, scenes you have never seen before. Connelly is gorgeous, but a little stiff as an American girl who is sent to a boarding school in Switzerland, and becomes involved in solving a series of murders. Pleasence is wasted, as he always is, as a bug doctor who befriends Connelly.
There are two different good film ideas in the script. One is ""A crippled bug doctor and a young student solve some horrific murders at a Swiss boarding school."" The second is ""A young student gets through her lack of friends by finding out she can communicate with bugs."" Blending the two ideas is a serious flaw. There are parts of this that scared me to death, and parts where I yelled ""oh, Dario!"" because what he was giving me as a viewer was so poorly thought out.
I realize I saw the butchered 82 minute version of the film but there are plot points in here that are so beyond the reach of belief, they must be seen to be believed.
""Creepers"" is creepy, and I recommend it, but with severe conditions.
The 82 minute version is rated (R) for physical violence, strong gore, and profanity.",1023148800,,2027,4.481081081081081
799643,5,6304132328,"This movie was awesome, pretty gory though, i mean its pretty rough to see a 14 year old girl get decapitated, but it was a great movie othr than that, some of the girls weren't very good actresses though, Jennifer Connely did great howevr and of course Donald Pleasance. This movie was very exciting though, and the best part about it was when Iron Maiden's song was in it , i finally found a film that they did a song for which was ""Flash of the Blade"" a great song from a great band, thr my favrite group too. If ur a Maiden fan then check it out. Creepers rocks, check it out if ulike 80's horror flicks, and don't worry this isn't ur average chop em up flick.",985219200,,664,4.155038759689923

As Jennifer invesitgates these  murders she enters the most horrifying nightmares she can ever encounter.  Some Gross out scenes but it still kept me glued to
the screen. Most  horror films of today can`t do that anymore. I lost all track of time when  seeing this film that`s how much i enjoyed this film. Destined to become a  modern day Horror classic!

It is enhanced by Argento's typically beautiful  cinematography and a great score (especially the theme,  ""PHENOMENA"" by Goblin).  Highly reccomended!

799831,3,6304132328,"I began writing my review of this whilst confusing elements of another Dario Argento movie I saw the very next day: Tenebre (Unsane).  But they have a lot in common.  ""Creepers"" and ""Unsane"" are the titles given to heavily edited versions of ""Phenomena"" and ""Tenebre"" by Dario Argento.  There are 30 minutes and 20 minutes edited out of the original movies, respectively.  These missing minutes are the goriest, most disturbing minutes of the film, and in some cases their removal actually creates confusion in understanding the story.  I liked what I saw a good bit, but I feel cheated for having sat through a heavily edited version when there is probably a director's cut available from another streaming service.  As a force of habit, I'd rather pay $20+ to buy the intact version on a DVD that won't arrive for a week or two, rather than watch the edited version that is free to stream right now. I think Amazon should move away from offering these cheaper versions.  Really, if someone is bothering to watch a horror movie made thirty years ago, its because they have some appreciation for film, the genre, and the history of cinema as it relates to censorship; give them the genuine article.  Let the people who are just hankering for a mindless horror movie have Sharknado.",1434499200,30,1281,4.764705882352941

I guess this is out on Blu-Ray under the title Phenomena, but I've already seen it once and that may be enough. I did sort of enjoy the goofy moments.

799839,2,6304132328,"Bizarre and haphazard, Argento's clumsy storytelling advances at a painfully slow pace until the brief, bonkers and satisfying finale.  Largely not worth a watch.

Director Dario Argento (Mother of Tears, Suspiria) is considered a master of horror.  I've read reviews suggesting that this is ""Argento's neglected masterpiece"" and ""one of Argento's best.""  Sorry to be a naysayer, but a masterpiece this is not.

Jennifer (Jennifer Connelly; Labyrinth, Dark Water), not your typical protagonist, is a sleepwalking psychic with an affinity for insects.  Argento's (at best) clumsy storytelling follows his typical trends.  Young women are being murdered and a heroine is guided by erratic, choppy, trance-like dream sequences to solve the mystery.  When Jennifer befriends an entomology professor with a pet chimp, that seemed to push it all over the edge of absurdity for me.

Our 14-year old heroine teams up with the professor to solve a string of murders taking place at a private school in Switzerland.  Making him perhaps one of the worst academics ever, the professor seems to have no difficulty finding instant credibility in Jennifer's telepathic connection to insects.

Now I called Argento's storytelling ""clumsy"" at best, and I realize this may upset some people. But watch this movie and I challenge you to find any plot significance in any of the scenesany of them.  The film wears on, murders accumulate, and we find ourselves no closer to knowing who or what the killer is or the motive behind the killing.  Not only does this story fail to lead us anywhere, but there are no attempts at clues, linking events or red herrings to keep us guessing.  The only thing I found myself guessing was why the Hell was this movie even made if Argento had nothing to say?  Aimless story or not, Argento sees fit to lead his actors into a strong fog of melodrama to make viewers believe that these vapid scenes actually yield some significance.

That said, whereas Argento is no storyteller, he has a strong grasp of instilling urgency as he makes almost every scene intense (even if unnecessarily so), using wildly inappropriate rock music to score up tension in otherwise mundane scenes.  It was as if someone calmly walking down a corridor merited a hair metal guitar solo.  The dream sequences feel drug-induced and keep our eyes locked on the screen so as not to miss a thing and the actors' melodrama certainly keeps our attention as we wonder how they may be linked to the murders.

Argento's strong suit is gore, which is most highlighted by the scenes with the deformed child and when Jennifer falls into a pit of festering human offal reminiscent of the pool scene in Poltergeist (1982) and the grave-digging scene in Drag Me to Hell (2009).  And despite the story's outcome which couldn't possibly have been deduced, the final act was full of bonkers murderous action which left me very entertained.  The closing scene answers the questions why did the professor have a pet chimp?  and is Jennifer's insect telepathy actually important in this movie?  However, the answers are far from intelligent or reasonable, doing little more than offering weirdly shocking moments in the finale.

I'd recommend that less seasoned horror fans skip this film until they find the insatiable desire to see everything (much as I do).",1382227200,5,3329,4.989130434782608
799948,3,6304132328,I enjoy the crossing over of Argento and Pleasance in this film. Creepers is version of Phenomena and is very typical  of Argento's style. Donald Pleasance is a nice addition to the mix. And he isn't even the killer!,1381708800,,216,4.538461538461538
799949,4,6304132328,"""Creepers,"" the bowdlerized version of a film released in Europe as ""Phenomena"" (hence the wonderful pun in my headline-- get it?), might be Dario Argento's strangest film. Given his oeuvre, this is quite a statement. But consider what this film contains: A serial killer, a girl who can communicate telepathically with insects, sleepwalking, mean girls at a boarding school, kidnapping, and mutants. With this everything-including-the-kitchen-sink approach (actually, it's a BATHROOM sink that plays an important role in one scene), Argento still manages to bring everything together to create a coherent work. Actually, that's not entirely true-- some of the stuff with the (I forgot to mention there's a very important monkey) doesn't make any sense at all, but it is entertaining as hell.",1377820800,,792,5.4471544715447155

Everything else just seemed like a dream with a few 'slasher' film images. I will have to revisit, it has been over 25 years and I have since read enough about the film to see it with different eyes.",1319155200,,314,4.508771929824562
799957,1,6304132328,"I was very disappointed with this incarnation of Phenomena(Creepers) by Dariuo Argento. I have an old VHS copy that looks and sounds better than this third rate transfer from Synergy. First of all, the DVD version should have retained the widescreen format, which the Anchor Bay version on VHS did. Second, the sound was terrible.  It should have been in the original Dolby stereo format. And just to further nitpick, the packaging was cheap and had no notes in liner. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie on DVD, but now, I`ll have to clean up the old VHS player if I do. The movie itself is at least a 3 star horror show, but this DVD version is no stars. I guess I should have checked out all options before buying this DVD. This is a lesson for me and thank goodness it didn`t cost any more than it did.",1274572800,,816,4.333333333333333
800046,4,6304132328,"Creepers is a pretty solid Horror movie in all aspects. If Creepers is a B-Movie, then I'd say it is a B+ Movie for all that is offers. This movie features Jennifer Connelly of movies such as ""Dark Water"" and ""The House of Sand and Fog."" We have seen Donald Pleasant most famously in the ""Halloween"" films and so many more. Jennifer is so young in the movie to where it was almost impossible to recognize her, since I had never seen Mrs Connelly when she was young. I think what this actress showcases most in this early film is a presence of mind and timing, all while being on film. Mrs. Connelly does not seem at all intiimidated by her craft nor by her cameras. She seems to be completely in the muse of her character.

What I do not see in this film are the lovely eyes of Mrs. Connelly. In her more modern films I have fallen in love with the actrecesses eyes and her often depressed or sullen characters. In films like ""Dark Water"" I just wanted to reach out to Mrs Connelly in love, because she seemed so very sad, and so much of this was portrayed through her beautiful and sad eyes. So much for the window to her SOUL. And then too there is Connelly's beautiful long hair. In Creepers I could recognize Mrs Jennifer through her long hair and the way she would face the camera and the way she would tilt her head.

As for this movie, it delivers in a solid manner. The plot is neither over done nor underdeveloped. I think in fact it is just about a perfect balance. In Creepers Jennifer Connelly plays a character named ""Jennifer"". I thought that was kinda interesting. She does go to a Swiss boarding school and in an area where a crazy psychopath is presently prowling the night, and day, killing young women. Early in this film Connelly sleepwalks right into a murder scene, and then off into the night and ultimately into the presence of the Donald Pleasance character, a man who is an entomologist, or someone who studies insects. And yes, Mrs Connelly has an affinity or some sort of telepathic connection to insects. She says she loves insects and that they will not harm her.

Anyway, what I liked about the movie was, first the lovely and young Mrs Connelly and then how the movie was your basic psycho drama, and all set to the music of bands like MotorHead, Iron Maiden, Bill Wyman and so many other contemporary rock bands of the time period. I feel the ""Horror"" aspect of the film was actually ehanced by the movie soundtrack which often played loud over scenes where we would see action but mostly only hear music.

The movie progresses to Mrs Connelly on a highway in a tour bus. She has a fly in a cage, one who can detect human decomposition. When the fly becomes agitated Mrs Connelly stops the bus and departs down a hill to a house. The house is vacant but she soon encounters the owner.

Later in the movie a lady at the college buys Connelly a ticket to return home to her father. Mrs Jennifer stays with the college lady until the next day when her bus is scheduled to depart. It is at the home of this lady where Connelly finds out to her dismay that the college lady is one of the two psycho murderers, or is she merely protecting her mutant son??

As the movie climaxes Connelly flees to a basement and falls into a pit of decaying HUMAN REMAINS, complete with the complement of MAGGOTS. On a wall by the pit is the local ""Inspector"" who is chained to a wall. Enter the psycho lady, who is grabbed as the Inspector frees one arm. The psycho lady is severely beaten in the face as she lies on the wall. Mrs Connelly escapes the pit and flees down a hall only to meet the ""Mutant Child"" who then assaults her. Mrs Connelly flees to a motor boat on a lake but does not leave the boat dock before the Mutant Child arrrives. The Mutant stuggles with Connelly in the boat and puntures the fuel tank. A fire ensues and both characters make a watery escape into the lake. A badly burned Mutant grabs Mrs Connelly again but escapes as he surfaces in the flames. Mrs Connelly makes it back onto shore. She walks up the hill and suddenly her father pulls up in his car. It quickly seems that there will be a touching reunion, and there almost was, that was before the psycho lady popped up BEHEADING THE FATHER with a piece of plate metal. So Jennifer summons her beloved INSECTS and the woman is quickly devoured and killed.

All in all this was a pretty good piece of Horror. I paid one dollar for this film on VHS. My money was very well spent and I was all in all entertained. Check this movie out. It's pretty scary, especially at the end. The Donald Pleasance character has little impact upon this film, and he seems merely there for plot purposes. The CHIMP seems to have been for comededic pleasure and he or she delivered.

In this film you have rotting bodies, two beheadings, maggotts, maggott flys, a chimp, sleepwalking, a mutant child killer, the protective psycho mother, telepathically controlled insects, a house with metal shudders that fall turning the house into a prison such as in seen in The House on Haunted Hill. And all of this is set to frequently loud music and some of it is vocals that deeply engrain the horror.

Check this movie out. You'll be CREEPED OUT. :)",1231545600,,5216,4.391304347826087
800047,3,6304132328,"Creepers deserves more credit then it actually gets. It's an italian movie, and parts of it seem like it's dubbed, but I really thought it was done very well. Donald Pleasant actually was great, it was nice to see him in another movie besides all the HALLOWEEN movies. Jennifer Connenly (sp?) gives a great performance to, as a girl who is sent to a boarding school. She has a very weird, but special talent. She can call and communicate with insects. There are murders happening all around the school, a killer who is after young girls...mainly tourists. The movie keeps a good pace, and the end has a great twist. This movie is worth checking out!",1205193600,,649,4.603448275862069
800048,3,6304132328,"""Creepers"" is a modestly scary and overtly creepy horror film starring the lovely Jennifer Connelly and Donald Pleasence as (surprise!) an eccentric scientist. Connelly is shipped off to a Swiss boarding school in an area that happens to have an insane killer on the loose. She immediately dislikes the leadership at the school, and begins sleepwalking. It turns out that she has telepathic abilities with insects, and becomes fast friends with Pleasence, a wheelchair-bound Scottish professor of entomology. Pleasence also has a helpful chimp as an assist animal, in what seems like a quirk of the plot.

Connelly is disliked by the girls at the school, but is able to turn the tables by summoning her insect friends in a wonderful scene, which is my favorite in the film. After several murders Pleasence and Connelly agree on a strategy in which Connelly will use her insect ESP to detect the murderer. It's a given that this leads to no end of problems for her and Pleasence both. The plot has an interesting twist as the real murderer is unveiled. You may not be surprised, but the revelation is still traumatic and very creepy. The film then has multiple false endings that involve a motorboat, a mutant, an insect swarm, a highly improbable fire, a tearful reunion, and a vengeful chimp (not necessarily in the order in which you would expect).

The film is gross, particularly at the very beginning and very end, and suffers from some bad heavy metal music in inappropriate places, but while it is largely predictable (and Donald Pleasence is his usual hammy self), it is a decent combination of psychological and physical horror that will be pleasing to fans of the genre.",1204675200,,1680,4.870629370629371

800050,2,6304132328,"The movie itself is promising, in a B-film, camp sort of way, and, if it hadn't been for one major problem, I would have really enjoyed this film.  The problem is the editing.  It is clear that some of the original dialog involved profanities which had been dubbed over.  It seems as if this were copied from American TV, and I'm wondering if there's a real version of this film out there.  I think some scenes or bits must have been cut out, perhaps to shorten it to the requisite 1hr. 30min. for late-night TV, as well as the dubbing, and, while it is not the type of Oscar-winning film, or true cult classic, normally released in a director's cut, I imagine there must be a cinematic release, preferably the European one, where the camp can truly shine.  If you're looking for a film that has a little bit of the same feel, but with a huge budget and great acting and a cop-buddy theme without the Miranda niceties, (O.K., not a whole lot a like except they're both set in the Alps) try this on for size:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crimson-Rivers/dp/B00000F527/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crimson Rivers</a>",1198713600,,1159,4.984455958549223

800052,5,6304132328,"A series of grizzly murders begin to take place, and an entomologist (Donald Pleasance) looking into the mating patterns of insects, thereby checking out the times and the settings of these killings, befriends the insect-friendly Jennifer Connelly. While dealing with Connelly and some things that happen to her locally, he finds that she has a strange ability - she basically produced a pheromone that attracts male insects and makes them bend to her will. This leads to some rather interesting moments where Connelly, the ""new girl"" at a rather snobbish school, flexes some insect muscle and creates some rather frightening moments. She also becomes involved in the murders directly, and the killer v. bug-lady battle ensues.

Dario Argento made some of the best Italian films of the 70s/80s/90s, and really handles the slasher genre well. He takes stories and makes them more than they should be, turning the dial on what could be mundane and making it bizarre enough to keep a person watching. He also knows how to handle the wonderful world of gore in ways that make horror fans salivate, and his experience with multiple genres lead to movies like the one listed here.

For fans of Argento and for people not wanting to watch a movie cut to make it fit the standards of early US importation, it needs to be noted that this is really the movie Phenomena with the film cut up. Yeah, Creepers is really something of a disgrace when you look at what is done to it, making a movie that isn't that terrible more tame than it should be and creating a dilemma of sorts. While Phenomena, hands down, is the best way to see the film, Creepers is still in-print and the OOP cost of the first versus the five spot touch of the second really makes Creepers a lot more appealing than it had been in years past. It also isn't THAT BADLY cut up; that is to say that it is about fifteen minutes light and the stuff that is missing isn't going to make you hate the thing you purchased. I was actually surprised by that; most of the movies that combine the words ""Italian"" and ""chopped up"" are something to avoid. This isn't even close to being that, however, and actually scores a really good grade.

For fans of Argento this is a good tool to pass the time until someone (hopefully Anchor Bay) notices the lack of releases by Fulci and Argento and decides to kick out something for the needy. I personally find myself happy with Creepers - considering - and would actually recommend it to people that need their Argento fix but can't find that Argento price.
As I said before, you don't lose tooo much of the movie and will be satisfied with what you take home.",1186790400,3,2650,4.586497890295359

Jennifer finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery when a madman begins killing other young girls. With the help of a kindly entomologist (Donald Pleasance), Jennifer sets out to reveal the identity of the killer. I actually like this movie a lot. The idea of ""talking"" to bugs may sound ridiculous, but it works! Connely is able to pull it off with ease. If you liked SUSPIRIA, then you'll enjoy this one.
