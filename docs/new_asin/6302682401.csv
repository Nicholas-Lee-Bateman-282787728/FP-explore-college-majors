7829109,5,6302682401,"Very true to the original play and without any of the fancy special effects that some directors like to rely on.  Excellent actors.  The characterization of Ariel was exceptionally good.  Costumes tended to be a bit exaggerated, but true to the time period fashions. The director took quite a bit of liberty in the first scene between Stefano, Trinculo, and Caliban, lending it a lot of semi-awkward sexual innuendo that tends to either make the audience laugh their heads off or squirm in their seats.  Other than that, there is little to nothing of the play's content that might offend an audience.",1338076800,,600,4.852941176470588
7829110,5,6302682401,"Usually after reading a Shakespeare play, I like to show the video.  Frankly, I wasn't too sure that my 10th graders would like this short (30 minutes) animated The Tempest.  It is a fairly faithful telling of the play.  The artwork is outstanding, the music adds to the video, and my students really liked it.  (Perhaps if is were longer, it would not be as good.)  The best part is that Miranda did not looke like a Disney female character!",1308009600,2,442,4.475
7829111,2,6302682401,"this movie is a recording of the play.  The sound is a little off, but it is extremely accurate. I watched it for a ckass and suffered through it for the accuracy, follwing with the book.  It is a weird story to begin with , but waching it in play form was slightly boring.",1281139200,,273,4.037037037037037
7829112,3,6302682401,"This indie production of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is a bit uneven, acting-wise.

While Efrem Zimbalist Jr. makes a fine Prospero, Ron Palillo as Trinculo is doing his Arnold Horshack ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" schtick. This edition, despite some performance and budget limitations, is true to the original and has the feel of an authentic 17th Century stageplay.

SYNOPSIS--
Prospero (the right Duke of Milan) and Miranda, his husband-hungry daughter are banished to a desolate island by Prospero's betraying brother Sebastian and the King of Naples. When a ship carrying his enemies comes near, Prospero casts a spell that creates a storm which wrecks the vessel, marooning all aboard on Prospero's prison island. One of these survivors, the King's son Ferdinand falls in love with Miranda, and she with him while Sebastian and the others wander dazedly around the island.

7829114,1,6302682401,Extremely disappointing.  I was hoping to share some scenes with my students to help them understand the play.  I'm afraid I would turn them off Shakespeare entirely if I showed them even a touch of this version.,1171065600,11,212,4.702702702702703
7829115,5,6302682401,"This Tempest is part of a great series of movies which tell the story of Shakespeare plays through cartoons, puppets, and clay figures. The music and wonderful claymation (or is it puppetry--not sure which) in this one makes it my favorite of the series! It is a excellent way of getting a grasp of the play.",1119657600,7,308,4.517857142857143
7829116,3,6302682401,"Firstly I'd just like to point out that on the box it says: ""Staged as seen in the 16th century"". In fact 'The Tempest' wasn't even written until around 1610/11, the 17th century, and thus it's highly unlikely that it was seen in the 16th.
This is a brilliant play, which has been adapted more successfully to film in the following versions:
- The Tempest, director: Derek Jarman, 1979
- Prospero's Books, director: Peter Greenaway, 1991
I wouldn't reccommend viewing Greenaway's version unless you have know the play quite well as it's a very artistic interpretation, and doesn't lend itself to storytelling, it's more preoccupied with the specifics of Prospero's 'art' (i.e. magic).",1085616000,52,684,5.061946902654867
7829117,4,6302682401,"This was a very entertaining production of Shakespeare's play.  I particularly found Ariel's character very true to the qualities of 'airy spirits.'  The costumes of all the characters were well-done.  I was not as keen on the parts with the jester and drunken butler as I was with the other characters, but overall, the scenes were played well.  For anyone who has never had a chance to see a stage production of The Tempest in a style close to the original play, this would be a good introduction.  Though some people may find Woodman's production of The Tempest banal, it could be very appealing to fans of Shakespeare's time and history, not just his plays.  If you only like lavish sets and modern ideals of stage productions, this edition may not be appropriate, but it need not be for the masses; only for select fans.",1065052800,35,825,4.655172413793103
