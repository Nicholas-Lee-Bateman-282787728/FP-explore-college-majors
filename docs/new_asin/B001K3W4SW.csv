The editor cuts in with a picture on picture that not only blocks the view of the artist but is either 3 steps ahead of what the artist is doing or behind the artist. It is just a badly made video with arbitrary cuts. An area is never finished before the artist starts something else but when you look that area later it is done. Constantly bad cuts all over. I like the artist. He can teach some very good methods but its just aggravating to watch. I don't know, I feel bad that the video is so poorly made but I do like the artists and if you want to take a chance, its only a few bucks. Oh, and it didn't play on my DVD player I had to watch it on my computer but its not where I paint so that's an inconvenience too.",1279584000,,805,3.8848484848484848
8314223,1,B001K3W4SW,"Lee Biven is a excellent artist, painter, and instructor.  The problem with this DVD was the filming. I felt like I was watching the ""blair witch project.""  The camera was moving all the time.  In and out and not steady.  The picture in picture, that is touted, often covers something that the viwer wanted to see. Film was poorly edited.  Bouncing around and often cutting off interesting parts.  Sorry, but I can not recommend this DVD at all.  Lee, come out with another DVD with good filming and editing and I would buy it, but not this one.",1246752000,,545,4.5
