7793945,5,0966971809,"Rumi truly is a poet of the heart.  The late, great Persian poet writes prose that truly stirs your emotions and touches your soul.  This beautiful film narrated by Debra Winger features some of Rumi's greatest fans (including Deepak Chopra and Robert Frost), readings of some of his most-loved works and beautiful oud accompaniment played by the great virtuouso Hamza Al Din.  I love the meditative atmosphere of this piece and it really moved me.  I reccomend RUMI: POET OF THE HEART to great fans of Rumi, as well people who  have never heard of him before.  This is a great introduction to the mood and sentiment of his works and shows the range of emotions he captured in his writing.",1186617600,2,689,4.652892561983471
