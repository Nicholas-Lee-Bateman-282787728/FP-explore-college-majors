657831,5,6303450083,"This wonderful example of a children's movie done right succeeds on an overwhelming number of levels. Not only is this film an enormously entertaining comedy with slightly off-the-wall characters and a bit of  slapstick thrown in for good measure, but also it manages to bring up many  deep and even frighteningly serious and heartbreaking philosophical ideas  that make this movie worth watching for audiences of all ages. Gloriously  presented in a high-tech stytle that is, fortunately, possible in today's  cinema, Casper is an all-around masterpiece and, possibly, the best kids'  movie of the decade.",913075200,2,606,5.3936170212765955

658279,5,6303450083,"I think Christina Ricci was very pretty and attractive in this movie.  I became a fan of hers for this reason and still am.  I went out and bought this movie on dvd in October 2016 and enjoy watching it.  In fact my favorite scenes were all of them she was in.  However when she said ""For once I would like to be in one place long enough to make a friend."" it reminded me of myself because I don't have hardly any friends.  In a few scenes when she was wearing the white dress however it kind of looked a little sloppy on her.  Nonetheless she was still very beautiful even in those scenes.  In fact watching her in this movie made me wish I could have met her in person at the time.  A couple cuss words are said during it but it is still a good movie.  I at first found it hard to believe that she was the same person who played Wednesday In The Addams Family.  Then I realized special effects and makeup can make a person's appearance change.",1502496000,,945,4.086956521739131

From director Brad Silberling and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment comes a live-action fun house ride filled with laughter, excitement and ghostly surprises. ""Ghost therapist"" Dr. James Harvey [Bill Pullman] and his daughter Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey  [Christina Ricci] arrive at the drafty old Whipstaff Manor. Its greedy owner, Carrigan Crittenden [Cathy Moriarty], has hired Dr. James Harvey to exorcise the house's apparitions: a friendly but lonely young ghost named Casper, who's just looking for a friend, and his outrageous uncles Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso The Ghostly Trio. If the plan works, Carrigan Crittenden and Paul 'Dibbs' Plutzker [Eric Idle], her partner-in-slime, can get their hands on the manor's fabled treasure. Meanwhile, Casper has found a kindred spirit in Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey, but The Ghostly Trio will not tolerate ""fleshies"" in their house. With hilarious antics and dazzling special effects from many of the creators of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Jurassic Park. CASPER is a mile-a-minute adventure comedy for the whole family.

FILM FACT: In the mirror scene, Dr. James Harvey was also supposed to transform into Steven Spielberg and according to director Brad Silberling, the cameo was filmed, but was cut for pacing reasons. Steven Spielberg was of course totally relieved, feeling that he is not much of an actor himself and was quite nervous in front of the camera. With the actress Cathy Moriarty came to fame in the brilliant Joe Dante 1993 film MATINEE playing two characters Ruth Corday and Carole.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: CASPER [1995] is based on the popular cartoon character, and this family-oriented ""ghost story"" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey [Christina Ricci]. But we have the eternally irritable Carrigan Crittenden [Cathy Moriarty] who discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in Maine in New England. Naturally, Carrigan Crittenden is totally furious about this, until her ""close personal friend"" and assistant, Paul 'Dibbs' Plutzker [Eric Idle], and discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house.

Carrigan Crittenden and Paul 'Dibbs' Plutzker take off for Maine in New England, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper ""the friendly ghost"" and his three ghostly uncles Stretch [Joe Nipote], Stinkie [Joe Alaskey] and Fatso [Brad Garrett]. After futilely recruiting an exorcist Father Guido Sarducci [Don Novello], more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night  Live and a ""professional ghost exterminator"" Dr. Raymond Stantz  [Dan Aykroyd], Carrigan Crittenden brings in a ""ghost psychiatrist"" Dr. James Harvey [Bill Pullman] [Bill Pullman] and his daughter Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey [Christina Ricci].

Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper [Malachi Pearson] befriends Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Ms. Carrigan Crittenden. The brilliant eye-popping special effects highlight this magical wonderful story that touches lightly on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper [John Kassir] all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror as Bill Pullman looks into in the house.

Of course there is also the CGI side of CASPER and the team of animators have done a wonderful job of making Casper and his uncles blend semi-seamlessly with the real life settings. There are no rough edges and everything works together making it feel less like CASPER was all about the CGI rather than using it as an embellishment to the laughs.

As for the acting, well the first thing to mention is that Malachi Pearson who provides the voice for Casper is totally brilliant and effective, delivering cute and funny lines from that slightly high pitched yet charming voice and matching the emotion of the comedy perfectly. But the real stars are Bill Pullman as Ghost therapist Dr. James Harvey and Christina Ricci as his daughter Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey and Bill Pullman does a decent enough job of having fun with his 2 dimensional character never trying to make it any more than a stooge for the various jokes played upon him by Casper's uncles Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso. But it works and in the scene where the tables are turned and Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey screams at seeing her first ghostly apparition and the fact that her father Dr. James Harvey also freaks makes it a fun, totally silly character.

What is really nice is that Christina Ricci having made her name as Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family film, Christina Ricci gets chance to shed the morbid outfits and play a semi normal teenager, and someone who befriends ghosts can't be completely that normal. Christina Ricci does well with the main character making her come across as your typical teenager and yet never adds too many dimensions to make her feel out of place in what is in effect a 2 dimensional cartoon. Christina Ricci manages to deliver the sweet,  but nice and cute at the same time, without over doing it and Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey interactions with Casper works so brilliantly, especially with the scene where Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey is being dragged through the halls by Casper and Christina Ricci goes slamming into a wall as Casper flies through it.

Whilst all this is really good and CASPER is for me a totally entertaining spookily fun film that I know all age groups will really enjoy and love, as there is something for everyone, especially when they do go for all those comical fright scenes, that has a slight horror aspect to it, but nothing too scary overall, especially in a not a nasty way but when Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso occasionally show their naughty side of their characters, the animation may give really young children a slight fright; but in fact as an adult I thought these moments were really cleverly done, but it's worth remembering when plonking young children down to watch the film, that it is all a totally harmless jolly fun film to watch.

What this all boils down to is that the film CASPER is a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable film, that manages to combine the use of brilliant CGI computer animation, with some more traditional elements, such as simple cartoon slapstick and blending them together brilliantly, to make this a totally amusing and fun filled film that has elements of some cuteness, but it definitely has a great deal of comedy going for it and it also has a couple of ghostly frights, making it a wonderful way to waste 100 minutes as you watch Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman interact with Casper the friendly ghost and his mischievous ghostly uncles. So all in all, it is a great fun film that will entertain you for many hours and it definitely has a repeat viewing enjoyment, as there is so much action going on, you sometimes miss stuff and that is why a repeat viewing is a must.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment brings us CASPER Blu-ray disc a really spooky haunting experience with a stunning 1080p encode image, as well as a very nice 1.85:1 [Anamorphic] aspect ratio. The image is very stable to look at, and giving us an image that is very detailed. With this Blu-ray, colours are faithfully rendered, and shadow details are also better than average, which is crucial with a film of this calibre, especially with so many dimly lit environments. In addition, the image is very clean, with some slight visible film grain, but nothing too bothersome. The haunted house's strange red-tinted interior, is offset by some more traditionally black, grey and blue rooms and stands out really nicely with a few brighter scenes, such as a few of the outdoor moments and a classroom sequence, deliver a healthy, but stable palette of colour and skin tones are really good. Black levels are never problematic, but hints of a push towards a dark purple shade are occasionally evident. Overall, it was still a good visual and an enjoyable presentation and top marks to Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment brings us CASPER a really spooky haunting experience with a very good scary soundtrack, especially with the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound track, that is filled with lots of quality ambient sound effects that are frequently more aggressive than they are subtle. Blowing winds, thunder, creaks, moans, and assorted haunted house scary moment effects are playfully implemented in terms of volume and stage presence and gives a brilliant robust performance. Ghostly voices float naturally and effortlessly throughout your surround speakers to good effect and are totally naturally integrated. Bigger action elements, such as when a ""train"" powers through the listening area, all of it is full of great fun. The James Horner composed music is aggressively big and potent yet clear and precisely placed around the sound stage, with a wide front end performance and can sometimes get slightly aggressive, but not too dominant. Generally dialogue reproduction is very strong and centre-focused. So all in all it is a very a good overall sound performance and again top marks to Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Revealing CASPER: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Movie [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [47:10] Here we view a really nice detailed documentary with some humorous overtones, where we explore the cast and crew's familiarity with modernising the characters. We also hear why Brad Silberling was hired as the director on the recommendation of Steven Spielberg, because before that Brad Silberling had been working previously for four years in Television. We also get view the set design model of the inside of the haunted house, sketches from the Production Designer, and several sketches of Casper illustrations. We also get to see some early rough video footage with interaction between the ghosts and the actors. We also get to see the physical demands of the roles of the actors, but at the same time they had a great lot of laughs, we see them creating the CGI digital effects for the characters. We see James Horner with the orchestra conducting his composed film music score, plus we also get to view the cast and crew attending the cinema premiere of the film CASPER and looks like they had a jolly time. Contributors include Brad Siberling [Director], Cathy Moriarty [Carrigan Crittenden], Bill Pullman [Dr. James Harvey], Joe Alaskey [Voice of Stinkie], Christina Ricci [Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey], Leslie Dilley [Production Design], Dean Cundey [Director of Photography], Malachi Pearson [Voice of Casper], Steven Spielberg [Executive Producer], Colin Wilson [Producer], Sherri Stoner [Writer], Deanna Oliver [Writer], Eric Idle [Paul 'Dibbs' Plutzker], Bill Pullman [Dr. James Harvey], Phil Nibbelink [Animation Director], Brad Garrett [Voice of Fatso], Joe Nipote [Voice of Stretch], Joe Alaskey [Voice of Stinkie], Rosemary Brandenburg [Set Decoration], Ed Verreaux [Art Direction], Gary Hymes [Stunt Coordinator], Kyle Odermatt [Digital Character Modelling Supervisor], Scott Farrar [Visual Effects Plate Supervisor], Stefen Fangmeier [Digital Character Co-supervisor], Dennis Muren [Digital Character Supervision], Michael Kahn [Film Editing], Eric Armstrong [Animation Director], David Carson [Chrachter Design Supervisor], Matthew Hendershot [Digital Modeler] and James Horner [Music Composer]. Written, Produced and Directed by Joseph J.M. Kenny.

Special Feature: Deleted Scene #91: Lucky Enough to Be a Ghost [1995] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:58] You have several ways of viewing this deleted scene #91: Lucky Enough to Be a Ghost. It informs the viewer that you have to Press Enter on your remote control to jump between the two different deleted versions of scene #91 and they are as follows: The First version of the deleted scene #91 is without the ghosts. The Second version is the animators reference which shows the actors holding models of the ghosts. You also have the option of playing the deleted scene #91 with an audio commentary by director Brad Silberling or playing the deleted scene #91 without the audio commentary. With the audio commentary we find out the reason the deleted scene #91 was not allowed to be fully filmed as the executives said the initial cost would be $100,000, but to actual get the go ahead to include it in the film complete would have come to a staggering $3,000,000. It is best to view it with the audio commentary as director Brad Silbering explains in great detail what you would actual see in the film if they had been allowed to complete the deleted scene #91.

Special Feature: The Harveytoons Show: Casper the Friendly Ghost: Penguin for Your Thoughts [1956] [1080i] [1.33:1] [7:00] Casper the Friendly Ghost returns a baby penguin to the South Pole. Voice Cast: Jack Mercer [Mr. Penguin] (uncredited), Mae Questel [Baby Penguin's Cries] (uncredited), Sid Raymond [Policeman/Plane Passenger] (uncredited) and Cecil Roy [Casper] (uncredited). Director: Seymour Kneitel. Screenplay: Larz Bourne. Music: Winston Sharples, Jerry Livingston and Mack David. The ""Casper"" character was originally developed by Joe Oriolo and Seymour Reit.

Feature Audio Commentary with Director Brian Silberling: Here we are personally introduced to the director Brad Silberling, and informs us that for the next 100 minutes and inform us he is going to subject us all to his personal ramblings about this film, but first of all informs us the film CASPER took well over 2 years to bring to the silver screen, and was a film with a lot of firsts, and was also the first time the character of Casper was revisited to the big screen after a hiatus of over 50 years and was of course originally introduced to us as the Friendly Ghost via the famous animated cartoons that was created in the late 1930s by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo, the former devising the idea for the character and the latter providing illustrations, as the basis for a 1939 children's storybook and then The Friendly Ghost was the first introduced by the Noveltoon that featured Casper, and was released by Paramount in 1945 with a few differences from the book and then eventually shown on American Television and began broadcasting post-September 1950 theatrical Famous shorts on a television show sponsored by Mattel Toys. But with this 1995 film it was able to combine CGI computer animation ghosts with the real actors, which were created via the wizardry of ILM [Industrial Light & Magic]. Brad also informs us that this was his first ever feature film, because previously over a four year period he had only worked in television. Brand also talks in great praise about some of the cast, especially the actress Cathy Moriarty and mentions some of the films this actress has appeared in like Raging Bull [1980], Neighbors [1981], White of the Eye [1987], Soapdish [1991], Analyze That [2002] and The Bounty Hunter [2010]. Brad also praises funny man Eric Idle, who he informs us that he was a massive fan of the British TV series Monty Python, and was totally honoured to have both actors in the film CASPER. Brad talks about scouting for locations to shoot the main bulk of the film, especially seeking out a real spooky looking old house, but because none were found, decided that the only option was to build one in the studio and 90% of the film was shot on one of the Universal film stage. As to the interior design of the house, the design was based on the Spanish architect Antonia Gaudi. Brad also informs us that he wanted to cram in as much homage to previous classic films. When you get to around Chapter 5 and around 19:44 when Dr. James Harvey and Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey walk into the haunted house for the first time, you get a view from above looking down on the two actors, and if you look closely at the floor carefully you would notice a certain pattern and brad points out that if the certain part of the pattern was yellow, you would realise it was another homage to the Judy Garland film and brad tells us the crew had a great time putting it all together. When you see Casper flies out of the window holding Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey ankle and flies over to the lighthouse, the ocean they are looking at was actually filmed in Point Reyes National Seashore that is a 71,028-acre park preserve located on the Point Reyes Peninsula in Marin County, California where Alfred Hitchcock filed The Birds and was filmed on a plate and Casper and Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey sitting on the top of the lighthouse was actual shot on Stage 12 at Universal Pictures. Brad gives great praise about the film music composer James Horner and mentions of his work on the film Titanic and was very keen to have him compose the music for CASPER as he knew he would do a really excellent job and it certainly works for me and Brad feels the scene near the end of the film when Dr. James Harvey comes into contact with his dead wife, was a truly wonderful emotional part in the film, as well as Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey meets the real Casper for a short while, both those scenes brought a tear to me. As we nearly come to the end of the film, Brad makes a comment that the film was a 2 year endeavour, and amazing learning experience, and sometimes never thought he would ever get the picture off the ground running, and looks back with great pride, and hopes you all enjoyed his audio commentary. Well some of it I liked and also some of it was quite interesting, but a lot of the time brad just rambled on about too many technical subjects that went right over my head and started to get a little boring, but despite this, it was still a nice audio commentary and to know that he really loved the film, especially a 2 year experience, so please give it a try and see if you agree with me about Brads audio commentary.

Finally, CASPER is a surprisingly brilliant wonderful funny film, and one that you might think it is going to be totally bland and generic around its edges, but you will find it has a much deeper scenario story line, much more welcoming, much more tender-heart of gold with emotions and I shed a slight tear near the end of the film. The characters are simple but strongly developed and definitely great performance from everyone in the film, even the CGI animated ghosts. The story is not all that novel, but the emotions that flow throughout the film are genuine and warm hearted and the special effects hold up extremely well. CASPER may not be a classic, but it holds up for lots of repeat viewings, as there is so much action going on and never loses its wonderful charm and inner dramatic appeal. All in all the film CASPER is a great deal of fun, fun, fun, and is especially at all age groups. Because I really enjoyed the film, I was hoping a follow up CASPER film would be in the pipeline, but sadly this is not to be, that is such a shame. Highly Recommended!

I love watching it for the funny, silly sense of humor of the ghosts and I really love the the magic that is in this film. I just think it is such a classic.  My favorite scene of the movie is when the ghosts are eating at the table and the food is falling on the ground--I just find that scene really funny! The special effects are really good for it being from the mid-90's and I just personally really enjoy the story line that the film has as well. It's super cute, family friendly and just classic in my opinion. The  I also was in love with Devon Sawa as a teen girl when this came out and so his appearance in the movie always just makes me smile! And I found out that James Horner does the music for the film and I LOVE his work! He is iconic in the film music industry. Just love it! Had to have it on my phone before a flight so I had something to watch in the airport travelling!

660064,3,6303450083,"This movie is ok, but the language is really not appropriate for small kids.  The characters say hell, damn, and bitch, at least.  The times I've seen this movie before it must have been edited for television because I didn't remember it at all.  My kids won't be watching this one for a few more years, at least.  By then, I'm not even sure they'll be interested.",1445817600,,364,4.388059701492537
660065,3,6303450083,"I can think of many movies made for kids and teenagers that adults appreciate and enjoy too, but this isn't one of them.  My husband and I found this movie to be silly and annoying.  The special effects were impressive, and there were several fun cameos, but we had to turn it off after approximately 30 minutes.  Except for a few funny scenes with Eric Idle (Cathy Moriarty should have taken a few more acting classes), the comedy is slapstick and falls flat.  And as another reviewer notes, the Ghostly Trio didn't work. The three ""bad"" ghosts were over-the-top obnoxious and irritating, and they were so loud, we couldn't understand most of what they said.

There are several instances of mildly offensive language I would not have wanted my children to hear when they were young.  Nothing terrible, but definitely not ""G-rated"" like movies made for children of yesteryear.  :-)

Having said all this, the Casper character was adorable, but not enough to carry the movie.

Not for kids under 10 years or so.",1445817600,2,1010,4.758620689655173

I loved Dan Aykroyd's (Ghostbusters) and Don Novello's (Father Guido Sarducci) cameos.  But, the highlight for me was the father-daughter relationship Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci pulled off.  The kind of relationship most father's dream of.

Casper was a little too bland in my ""watching cartoons days""; but, in this movie he has more character.  You will share his emotional roller coaster in his infatuation with Cat (Ricci) and in his embarrassment over his ghoulish compatriots.

Lots of gags, cute lines, wonderful script.  Parents!  You can watch and enjoy this one with your kids!",1414454400,,724,5.441441441441442

There are also three not so friendly ghosts that happen to be Casper's uncle's.

661412,4,6303450083,"Casper is a 1995 American live action film produced by Harvey Entertainment and Amblin Entertainment, and released by Universal Studios.

The film follows widower Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kathleen""Kat"" (Christina Ricci, yes Wednesday Addams) as he travels all over the United States to help people connect with their deceased loved ones. While having done this he was unable to reconnect with his deceased wife Amelia.

At the same time he is enlisted to help a greedy gold-digger Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) rid her newly inherited mansion Whipstaff Manor of the ghosts that have been responsible for haunting it. Meet Stretch, Fatso and Stinky the Ghostly trio. Mean spirited and territorial about humans in their home. They currently raise their nephew Casper McFadden (voice of Malachi Pearson), who is actually friendly and teaches Kat not all ghosts are evil. Casper and Kat bond and share a powerful friendship, while Dr. Harvey tries to help The Ghostly Trio. But things get ugly when Carrigan and her assistant Dibs (Eric Idle) break into the manor to find a so called treasure. After realizing the treasure can't be found by a mortal, Carrigan tries to murder Dibs. However, after her antics fail she ends up dying after crashing her car into a tree. Yes ""THE BITCH IS BACK!"" and while Dr. Harvey and the ghostly trio enjoy happy hour he accidentally falls to his death and becomes a ghost. To make things worse Cat's party guests arrive, and before she can do anything she is heartbroken when she sees her father is a now a ghost. Casper realizes that Dr. Harvey's life is more important than his and turnd him human with a machine his father invented.

James is then visited by his deceased wife who is now an angel in heaven and states that she had no unfinished business, and thanks Casper for being selfless so she grants him his wish. And the movie ends as the guests are scared out by Casper.

Superb release, Widescreen and excellent bonus features.",1408752000,,2000,4.8563049853372435

661415,4,6303450083,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatre back in the 90s.  I liked the way it explored Casper, born Casper McFadden, as a person, regardless of whether he was ""alive"" or ""dead,"" and told us something about his life and his living family.  I found Christina Ricci, as Kat, the girl he falls in love with, to be charming and engaging.  Bill Pullman, as Kat's weirdo scientist father, seeks to learn what ""haunts"" ghosts and discussed some interesting theories about what drives spirits.  Casper's uncles, the obnoxious Ghostly Trio, I could have done without.  I found their slapstick over the top and heavy-handed, not to mention, unnecessary.  The film is at its best when showing how a child's consciousness, lingering after physical death, continues to seek some meaning in a new plane of existence.",1407715200,3,808,4.818840579710145

661520,5,6303450083,"Normally, NO thanks to Chernabog's wraiths and ""Grim Grinning Ghosts"", I cannot *stand* spirits; but when it comes to the oldest 'Casper' cartoons and this AWESOME movie, it's a BIG exception along with the Hogwarts ghosts!!

Storyline:
As I stated in my review of the 'Casper' novelization, this was a brand-new, fresh take on the 'Cinderella' story with Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Little Mermaid', 'The Phantom of the Opera' (ha-ha-ha), and Tim Burton's 'Edward Scissorhands'.  BUT- it is *not* like 'Twilight'!!
There's the whole rags-to-riches-back-to-rags thing, the problem with being- um... 'non-human' so to speak, *special* guy liking girl/'normal' guy likes girl, too/girl chooses 'normal' (OUCH), a relationship that you and the other two know it's never going to be...

Characters that I LOVED:
Casper McFadden is the kind of friend that I sure could have used in middle school: sweet-natured, friendly (DER), kind-hearted, and just as genuine as a boy ('fleshie' or not) can be!  And his line ""...Can I keep you?"" is SO much more romantic than Cullen's ""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb...""  HEART his voice-actor who got his character down-PAT, but when I saw Devon Sawa, *my* reaction was ""That is so NOT Casper!!""  He didn't look or sound the least BIT like our favorite kindly phantom; sorry-not-sorry, fan-folks!!  It was -and still IS- a *big* SLAP in the face to me!
When I'd read the book, I did NOT like Kat Harvey because of her screaming in Casper's face when she first saw him, AND of her choosing 'fleshie' Vic DePhillipi over Casper the Friendly Ghost; OUCH in both senses, much...?!  And in the movie, once the clock struck and Casper turned back (I'll admit I gave a HUGE sigh of relief, smiled, and said, ""THERE you are""), it was like, to Kat, the kiss never happened!  But I DO like her:  she's as sarcastic as Severus Snape and hurting just as much as he is from the death of a loved one (she even looks like she could be related to him!), and her actress Christina Ricci is naturally beautiful, kind-hearted, and funny!  And said actress plays the misfit in the AWESOME movie 'Penelope'!!
Dr. James Harvey- how can you NOT love this guy?!  He's funny, adorable (AND a-DORK-able), hot (yes, I'll admit it; the glasses work), kind-hearted, and warm- James POTTER could have taken 15 leaves out of his book!  He's torn after the car crash that killed his best friend/wife Amelia, and becomes a GHOST shrink; as such, he has to travel around from place to place with Kat.  He finally settles down in Friendship, Maine at Whipstaff Manor.  The only thing that I DIDN'T like was his friendship with the Ghostly Trio:  Stretch, Fatso, and Stinkie; those... JERKS treated Casper WORSE than dirt!!  I guess James forgot that when they got him so plastered drunk...
Amelia Harvey is like the red-gowned/winged brunette version of the Blue Fairy from Disney's 'Pinocchio', and even though she's an angel, she's Casper's fairy godmother for the night; I *loved* that!  And I teared up when she was talking to James.

Setting:
GOR-GE-OUS and so NOT your stereotypical gothic Victorian haunted house!!!  Maine is one of the most beautiful places in the world, and Whipstaff Manor, inside and out, brings Tim Burton to mind!!  The lab was pretty good, too!

Soundtrack:
LOVED it, *loved* it, *LOVED* it!!!  James Horner did an EXCELLENT job on 'An American Tail' and 'The Pagemaster', and he was ecstatic when asked to do the music for 'Casper'; when he read the script, he saw it NOT as just a funny cartoon movie, but a modern-day fairy-tale.  When you listen to the music, that's just what's being told!!

HATE Carrigan Crittenden, but Dibbs is *wickedly* funny; HEART Casper himself, but LOATHE his uncles; am of two minds about Vic and HATE Amber.

LOVED both this movie *and* the behind-the-scenes feature (always *hearted* those since Disney)!!  Watch it on either MegaVid or buy it as soon as possible!!!  And to those of you who HATE 'Twilight':  burn the book, throw out the CD, keep the music since you actually like it and pretend it's to some other movie, and buy/watch this gender-bent 'Cinderella' with a BELIEVEABLE low-key romance between a kindly young phantom and a beautiful sarcastic brunette who does NOT treat her a-DORK-able dad like dirt!",1400889600,,4295,4.861263736263736

661668,5,6303450083,"Casper The Friendly Ghost was a famous cartoon of the 1950's and 1960's.  A few decades later it became an excellent movie starring Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci.  Pullman plays a scientist who is interested in the paranormal since the death of his wife, and he is one kooky scientist!  Ricci, is his long suffering daughter who puts up with her dad's kookiness.  They move into a haunted house to investigate ghosts and encounter Casper, a ghost who was a boy about 80 years before.  The plot is great, the two ""bad guys"" are portrayed by Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle.  There are some guest appearances such as ""Ghostbuster"" Dan Akryod who runs out of the house afraid.  The plot is great as well as the scenery inside the house and good special effects.  This is a fun movie to watch with the family and has some quite touching scenes as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1382227200,2,869,4.590909090909091
661699,5,6303450083,"I just had to buy this DVD although it had been ages since I took my daughter, then junior-high age, to see the movie. The story is one to which children and parents can relate, and the ghosts are not too scary, exhibiting the right mix of fright and comedy. The story also shows the common experiences and attitudes adolescents have in every century, and it is important for young people to be aware of these rites of passage. Cristina Ricci's character is touched when she learns about the tragedy that cut short the life of Casper, the young man whose spirit cannot rest or leave his childhood home. The ghostly encounter culminates in the sense of a dream coming true -- something from a fairy tale -- in the magical moment when she can see Casper and dance with him. I especially would recommend this film as a Halloween tradition for the entire family.",1381968000,,858,4.541935483870968

But when she enters the rickety mansion to seek her claim, she is frightened away by a wicked wave of ghosts. Determined to get her hands on this hidden fortune, she hires afterlife therapist Dr. James Harvey to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion. Harvey and his daughter Kat move in, and soon Kat meets Casper, the ghost of a young boy who's ""the friendliest ghost you know."" But not so friendly are Casper's uncles--Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie who are determined to drive all ""fleshies"" away.

It has a good cast but their talents are wasted on an awful script.  It goes to show you if Steven Spielberg is involved and you spend 50 million dollars on a movie people will come and see it whether it is good or not.  Eric Idle of Monty Phython is in it who is normally very funny.  They do not use his talents to their advantage in the movie.  He doesn't get much in the way of funny scenes.  Casper is portrayed pretty well, but he is put in situations that he would have never been in in any of the cartoons.

662260,5,6303450083,"In a small town in Main there is a legendary mansion called ""Whipstaff Manor"" which is rumored to be haunted by spirits yet it's true. a Lonely friendly ghost named Casper (Voiced by Malachi Pearson) is in need of a friend yet somehow doesn't seem to be making friends and his three mean uncles named Stinky (Voiced by Joe Alansky), Stretch (Voiced by Joe Nipote) and Fatso (Voiced by Brad Garret) loves scaring off intruders. A paranormalist named Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman) and lovely daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) moved into the mansion for a new home and for studying on the paranormal as they don't know what to expect as Casper befriends them while the uncles want them out of the house.

Exciting, funny and well done adaptation of the popular Harvey comics! Directed by ""City of Angels"" director Brad Silberling, written by Animaniacs/Tiny Toons writer Sherri Stoner and produced by Steven Spielberg is definitely good fun for adults and kids. The special effects by Industrial Light and Magic are terrific and the film does co-star Cathy Moriartiy with Eric Idle and appearences by some famed stars including Dan Ackroyd. There is some emotional moments like the climax and of course good laughs abound, it's a nice hit movie for everyone.

The only thing I can say about this movie that is negative is that some of the language was inappropriate for smaller children.  The premise of a man trying to help ghosts with their psychological issues is wonderful, considering the fact that his wife had recently passed away, and it explains his need to prove to himself that the after-life exists.  Christina Ricci is adorable in this film, she is the ivory soap/sweet heart next door and you can't beat that in a children's film.  Again, the only negative I can say is that some of the language is coarse, not right out swearing, but coarse and not always what I would consider appropriate for small children, but the movie overall is great.",1243382400,,806,4.654929577464789

662412,5,6303450083,"Casper is a character that has existed in our minds and our hearts for over 70 years in comic strips and cartoons. Finally, in the year 1995 we are treated to our first live action incarnation of this fantastic character. With the help of Christina Ricci and some exceptionally sweet voice acting by Malachi Pearson we are given a highly enjoyable, highly loveable family picture that teaches us an important message of friendship, family and most important of all moving on while still holding onto the memories of the loved ones we have lost.

The story focuses around despicable idiots Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) and Dibbs (Eric Idle) and their quest to find the treasure hidden in a rundown old mansion left to Carrigan in her fathers will. The biggest problem facing Carrigan and Dibbs about Whipstaff Manor are the ghosts that inhabit it. Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch are 3 of the 4 ghosts that inhabit the manor and they're not too pleasant to be encountered by. Casper is the 4th ghost and isn't like the other 3, he just wants a friend to play with so he uses Carrigans plan to have ghost psychiatrist James Harvey (Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci) move in.

Ricci was about 15 at the time of the making of this and although it wasn't an Oscar winning role, she certainly played the part of the disgruntled teenager well. The character of Casper was exceptionally sweet and not in an overbearing or sickening way as is the case with most movies based around the sweet characters. Luckily that sweetness is covered a lot for the cynical members of society thanks to the obnoxious uncles Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch and the criminal idiocy of Carrigan and Dibbs.

This is a film packed with childish clichs we have all come to know and love, such as the basics of courtesy and friendship. The usual slapstick humour we come to expect is also there and is helped by the characteristics of the ghostly uncles, Fatso in particular. Although that character may not be very PC today, there's no doubting that at the time the character was simply put in place to be the threatening big character who turned out to be quite laughable. The interractions between Casper and Kat are sometimes flawless and on a personality level is actually quite heart wearming. Some of the interractions thanks to the believable acting of Ricci make you think that she is really talking to a large headed ghost, and he is really making them breakfast.

Talking of interractions, the CGI is something to really shout about as for the time this film was made CGI specialised such as this had never been seen before. The interractions between the CG animated ghost and reality are flawless to say the least. Food interraction, communication between the actors and the ghost characters and other general interractions between CGI and reality are truly without flaw.

Casper is an enjoyable character and the whole message of passing over in regards to the ghosts is very special indeed. I highly applaud this film for managing to competently put across what some people would consider a sickeningly sweet storyline, and making it an enjoyable experience for the entire family to thoroughly enjoy. One particular part of the film which I loved was the cameo of Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Rodney Dangerfield.

I would highly recommend this film and its sequels, although I haven't seen the sequels myself but I'm sure they would be good.",1232150400,2,3418,4.804421768707483

To be fair, it is a PG film but the it would have played just fine without the language. If families were Spielberg's target audience (who else would watch this), he had to know that the language would keep younger viewers out and that older teens might not be interested in Casper. It was just strange language to hear in a film strongly promoted as ""family."" If you read the other reviews, you will see others noting this.

662415,3,6303450083,"Casper
Many people have asked me when I was going to kick off the Halloween Season recently, and now I have. Casper is a child-friendly ghost story that is based off an old cartoon series. Considering this film was made in 1995, Casper has held up very well. If you are looking for a fun movie for your children to watch, you might want to check out Casper. If you are an adult, avoid this at all costs.

The story is very light hearted. Carrigan, a greedy woman, has just inherited a haunted Manor. There are three threatening ghosts: Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso. There is also a friendly ghost, Casper. Carrigan knows of a treasure somewhere in the manor, but needs to get the ghosts out of way to get to it. After many other choices, she settles with Dr. Harvey. Harvey and his daughter, Kat, move into the home in hopes to drive the ghosts out.

The CG used for the ghosts is phenomenal. Even in today's world, this CG stands up well to the rest. You can see through the ghosts, but at the same time they have a thickness to them. You will never complain about having a dated movie.

The relationship between Kat and Casper is the most interesting part in this movie. As an adult, the corny story telling will not keep the amused for long. Kat and Casper have a couple deep altercations. Casper asks Kat ""Can I keep you,"" and Kat agrees. However, Casper tries to kiss Kat, but Kat only feels a chill. It is tragic.

If you are an adult Casper is worthless. If you are looking for a fun Halloween flick for your children, this is for you. There are a few derogatory words, but nothing a mature child cannot handle. Then again, Casper usually comes on television each Halloween. You might want to avoid this one on that note.",1222905600,2,1727,4.3875
662416,2,6303450083,"Yet another dopey kiddie movie with almost nothing to offer the parents who have to sit in the theater because their little munchkins wanted to see this stuff.  Honestly, why don't family movies aim a little higher?  Pixar has proven over and over again that it's possible to make a smart, funny movie that people of all ages can enjoy.  Anyway..

I do not own Casper on DVD; I saw it in the theater.  I don't even remember why I went to see this; it was probably a family outing, but I might have gone because I'm a fan of animation.  Bleh.  The ghosts looked lame, the story was full of holes, the characters were shallow & two-dimensional, the acting was mediocre.  The only reason I'm even reviewing this turkey is because of the set design.

That's right, I said set design.  I was way more excited by the Casper _house_ than by the foolery that was taking place in it.  The sets were heavily inspired by the work of late-1800s Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi (the organic, spirally ceiling in the girl's bedroom is a direct quote from an apartment building in Barcelona.)  I thought initially the Gaudi references were just a fluke, that they accidentally used his style as a single piece in what was going to be an incoherent Art Nouveau collage ... but every interior shot, every new area of the house looked like a fanciful (but faithful) interpretation of Gaudi's style (except the basement, which didn't match at all.)  I was amazed that somebody took the effort to reference a particular architect and maintain a plausible pastiche of his style throughout.  I had never really paid a lot of attention to movie set design before, but this show was so forgettable that I found it easy to look at the backdrops instead.  Also helps that I knew about Gaudi and was an admirer of his idiosyncratic work long before seeing the movie.

Casper's set designer gets five stars, but this lame movie only deserves two.  Highly recommended as a visual reference for eccentric Art Nouveau interior design.",1222214400,2,2002,4.6581196581196584

I felt sorry for Casper when he lost his chance to live permanently as a human, but I understood why he did it.  Overall, there are a lot of emotional moments and laughs in the film.

662515,3,6303450083,"There was something about Casper that attracted me to it, although I'm now a twenty-something. Could it be something to do with the fact I never actually got around to watching it when I was young? Probably. BUT I did have the movie novelisation, complete with film stills. Hehe.

I do get in the mood to watch kiddies' movies now again (or movies aimed purely at pre-teen squealing girls), it's something to do with reliving my childhood. But with Casper, I seriously don't think I could have watched this as a kid. It was so boring! The first half anyway. I thought it kicked it towards the end, but I was bored throughout the first half, and started texting on my phone. Not a good sign.

However, I love Christina Ricci, she's definitely one of my favourite actresses, and have recently been watching some of her older films, after seeing Addams Family Values on TV! I always loved some of her older roles (Now & Then is a particular favourite), and she certainly surpassed herself in this, with having to act opposite a CGI character after all.

I do wish there had been a bit more of a storyline with Casper & his deceased dad. There wasn't much mentioned about it, I kinda had an idea in my head of what Edward Scissorhands did, with the flashback interaction scenes between Johnny Depp & Vincent Price. (Technically not his dad, the inventor, but never mind.) And is it just me, or is it never clearly explained how Casper died? I found out on IMDB that he was playing on his sled all day, and got pneumonia, but I don't remember that being said. Or was that when I was texting?

Casper is a safe family film. There are no innuendoes in this, as so many kiddie films have in them these days, which are for the adults to understand, and the kids to understand some day. It's safe, boring & predictable. I did get all emotional at the end (look out for Devon Sawa starring opposite Christina again, and sharing their second screen kiss!), but it does take a while to get going. The beginning is definitely not kids friendly.",1182816000,,2030,4.493224932249323

A treasure is supposedly hidden within its walls, so she hires a ghost ""shrink"" and his precocious teenage daughter to rid the house of the spooks.  Kids will probably find it amusing, although there is some strong language and sexual innuendo.

662640,4,6303450083,"You would think Casper would just be a silly little film that only a child could possibly love.  Surprisingly, though, it's actually a very entertaining film that even manages to produce a poignant moment or two in between scenes of regular hilarity.  The fact that Christina Ricci is in the movie doesn't hurt either - that's the main reason I wanted to see it.  The whole cast is actually quite good, even Bill Pullman (who I'm grudgingly beginning to halfway like for some crazy reason - and yes, you do get one of those vintage Pullman turnaround shots before the movie ends).  The non-human characters really steal the show, though, as Casper's uncles Stinkie, Stretch, and Fatso are a real hoot and steal every scene they're in.

As far as the story goes, you've got this old abandoned mansion in Maine where Casper lives with his three obnoxious uncles.  Casper is of course quite lonely, and his uncles will not tolerate humans at all.  Then the old dude who owns the condemned place dies and leaves the house to his greedy daughter Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty), who comes running in search of a hidden treasure.  She and her friend/partner in crime (Eric Idle) don't last more than a few seconds in the house.  With a little secret encouragement from Casper, however, Carrigan finds out about a ghost shrink named Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and invites him to the house.  Casper is overjoyed because he has a potential new friend in Harvey's daughter Kat (Christina Ricci).  There are several little subplots that play out rather well, but it's mainly just a matter of sitting back and letting all the ghostly hi-jinx work their magic.  That's not to say the movie isn't sad at times, as you can't help but feel sorry for poor lonely Casper.

I thought the animation and digital effects were done really well; it would have been so easy to go way over the top, but ILM knows what they are doing.  It can't be easy to work with characters you can't even see (except via their stand-ins during filming), but I found the interaction between ghosts and humans to be very natural and believable.  It's really a great family film because kids will surely enjoy all of the ghostly antics, adults will find themselves laughing along more often than not, and the movie definitely has a heart.  You can also have fun spotting all of the many celebrity cameos that pop up all over the place.

662644,3,6303450083,"I just rented this tape to watch with my kids, and found myself grateful that they tend to talk through movies. The language is not appropriate for a children's movie - and some of the profanity is not subtle (e.g. a ghost loudly proclaiming that ""the b--ch is back"").

Eric Idle is a nice touch, some of the interactions between father and daughter are well-done, _but_ the evil character is drawn with absolutely no subtlety, the screams of ghost-spotters become tedious, and the aggression and (implied) violent deaths are not appropriate for small children.

I suspect many of my objections are the filmmakers' attempt to ""spice up"" the movie for a teen audience, but they certainly remove a large pool of potential viewers; I wouldn't expose a child less than about 10 to the language (by then they'll have heard it from their classmates, and parents will have had a chance to train them not to use it).

Casper the Friendly Ghost is very excited when he learns that Dr. Harvey and his pretty young daughter Kat are going to be living in his house (maybe he can finally make a friend!); but his ghostly uncles have other plans...
The premise of Casper is that ghosts exist, are ""spirits with unfinished business"" (hence they have not yet ""crossed over""), and interact freely with ""live"" people at times;  (they haunt houses and wreak havoc on people who trespass there). For those who are worried about content: there is a scene where a man gets drunk in a bar and has an accident, there is a Halloween costume party, there are a few ghosts who are ""mean"" and play tricks and scare people, and a few arguments between characters in the film. There is a very sweet and innocent kiss between a girl and boy, but otherwise there is no objectionable content in that respect.  Language: there are a few swear words, so be aware!

If you can view this film with the belief that it is just a cute and funny film about ""ghosts,"" which as we know do not exist, it is a most enjoyable film. If you cannot rest easy while watching a film about ghosts, then by all means don't watch it.

662746,4,6303450083,"Casper (not to be confused with ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"" or any of the Casper The Friendly Ghost cartoons) is an interesting mix of elements both good and bad - but mostly good.
Without a doubt, the movie's strongest asset is its humor.  By and large, this is thanks to Casper's uncles Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso (The Ghostly Trio), all of whom are hilariously animated and perfectly voiced by three actors whose names I unfortunately can't remember.  Bill Pullman is also very funny as Dr. Harvey, and great supporting comic performances are lent by Cathy Moriarty as the evil Carrigan Crittenden and Eric Idle as Carrigan's long-suffering sidekick, Dibs.
All of this, of course, amounts to a sub-plot in the end - a prominent one, but a sub-plot nonetheless.  The main story is that of Casper (voiced by Malachi Pearson) and Dr. Harvey's young daughter, Kat (Christina Ricci).  Ricci says some of her lines awkwardly (in my opinion), but for the most part does a nice job.  Jessica Wesson's portrayal of Amber, the snotty girl at Kat's school, is perfect.
I think the movie's flaws lie in its plot more than anything else.  For instance: throughout the story, Kat has a crush on Vic, the supposedly cute (and slimy) kid at her school, but in the end when Vic shows his true colors and stands her up at the Halloween party, she doesn't really seem to care at all.  There is a brief shot of her sitting by the wall with a pouty (well, really, more broody) expression on her face, but this is dispensed with in an instant.
Another of my biggest beefs is with the ending.  I don't want to give away specifics, but it is the weakest part of the story - bittersweet and touching one moment, and then it turns raucous and weird before you can blink.  Makes you want to throttle the nearest neck.
Ah, well.  As I said earlier, the movie is far more good than bad, and of course everything here is just one person's opinion.  Who knows.  You might love the ending.  But if not, I have a feeling you'll like most everything else.",1072396800,3,2028,4.569060773480663

Maybe it seems odd to give this film five stars, but then you have to commend them for making a good big budget movie about Casper. That had to be tricky. It's simple in some ways, I mean, you have the usual, greedy crook villain character that's in so many live-action cartoon movies, and you have the usual silly lines and some bad acting here and there, but there are so many good things about this movie too. The effects are great, as well as the music and the Haunted House. The voices are also excellent. Plus, there were a lot of cool cameos, which were really the best parts of the movie. Especially Dan Aykroyd in a very brief scene as Ghostbuster Ray Stantz. It was a little weird when we see Casper in the flesh at the end, looking older and acting smoother than he sounds and appears as a ghost.

  Casper is a friendly ghost who lives in an old mansion with his three rude, even abusive uncles. It's all very much a take on Cinderella. A mean, greedy woman named Carrigan has recently inherited the mansion and believes there is a treasure hidden in it, so she hires Dr. James Harvey to get rid of the ghosts so she can do a thorough search. The doc has a daughter named Kat, played by Christina Ricci, who Casper develops a crush on and makes friends with. The Doc tries to talk the ghosts into moving out, and Kat plans a big Halloween party, while Carrigan causes trouble. Various characters die, become ghosts, and even come back to life through the course of the film, leading up to thwarting the bad guys and having a very Cinderella-like ending. Very cute for the most part, and definitely the best Casper movie out there. Well worth getting a DVD of, so please, somebody, make one okay?!!!",1006905600,4,2138,4.355889724310777

Kat hates all the moving because she never gets a chance to live in a particular place long enough to make any friends. When her father is asked to find the spirits who live in a haunted house in Maine, he promises Kat that this will be the last place they will move to.
A woman who wants Kat's father to talk to the ghosts wants him to do that because she is looking for a ""secret treasure"" that has been hidden in the house for years. Little does anyone know that this is the home of Casper the ghost and his ""uncles"": Stinky, Fatso, and Streatch. And they are not happy that somebody is moving into their house except for Casper. Casper is excited because Kat - a girl - is moving into the house, too.

662972,4,6303450083,not for the language. There wasn't much but it certainely made itself clear. I didn't feel there was any need for it in this movie at all! So little kids and parents be warned! Still it's a great lot of fun and  deffinitly worth looking into! :-) check it out. A good ending and good  plot points make it exciting and fun with some pretty good laughs  throughout.,957052800,13,363,4.3088235294117645
662973,3,6303450083,"Abnormal psychologist and his daugter are tasked to rid an old mansion of three crude ghosts by a materialistic, greedy business woman and her idiotic companion. Funny and impressive comedy with a few recognizable  faces (the one you really have to catch is Wesson from HOME IMPROVEMENT)  and cameos from some famous faces. The best has to be Aykroyd from  GHOSTBUSTERS carrying his proton pack with him. The ghostly trio are also  funny and no death joke is ignored. Might possibly be past children.",945993600,2,500,4.916666666666667
