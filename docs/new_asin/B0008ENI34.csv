8055665,5,B0008ENI34,"Since I really enjoy watching Brendan Fraser (he reminds me of my actor son) and Martin Sheen, this was a rare find.  The movie was
beyond what I expected since it was early in Brendan Fraser's career.  He and Martin Fraser did an excellent job.  This movie is a real tear jerker, especially since it is based on a true story.  I am afraid things like this scenario still  happen today.",1433203200,,386,4.380281690140845
8055666,5,B0008ENI34,"This movie really show how the justice system can really work against you, when you are an innocent man.wonderful acting a must for true story buffs or anyone who like to watch a good movie",1391126400,2,189,4.428571428571429
8055667,4,B0008ENI34,This is an old movie now but still one of the best for its time. Also a very good one for these actors. Its nice to own it on DVD now. The picture was of very good quality and im pretty sure there was some scenes in there that I don't remember from my recorded tv version.,1361145600,,272,3.789473684210526
8055668,5,B0008ENI34,Love this movie it shows a lot about how our justice system can sometimes be faulty and an innocent person can be punished for a crime they didn't commit.,1358035200,,154,4.344827586206897
8055669,5,B0008ENI34,"I understand that this movie was based on a true story and the main characters worked very well together. I was not sure at first that pairing Mr. Sheen and Mr. Fraiser was a wise one. Previous movies I had seen with Mr. Fraiser were a much lighter tone than this one. However he did an outstanding job and Mr. Sheen as his father made for a riveting movie. As the movie played out Mr. Sheen gave an excellent performance as the father who first believed his son guilty and then found himself in the position of realizing that his son was indeed innocent. Mr. Frasier started out very angry and betrayed, but as his father worked to prove his innocence their relationship became stronger. This isn't just a rainy day, I have nothing else to do movie. This is a very well done film and all the actors gave stellar performances. Well worth your time...any time!",1348531200,2,859,4.477707006369426
8055670,4,B0008ENI34,"I was working a fund raiser outside of a major department store when a man approached me and started to chat.  He told me how he was imprisoned for a murder he did not commit and told me to rent this movie because I looked like I didn't believe him.  How could I pass this up?  Now I needed to know the full story.  After meeting him personally, the entire movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  The movie helped me understand how this actually happened and how persistence can pay off.",1277337600,4,486,4.127659574468085
8055671,5,B0008ENI34,"This is a gripping story of a family taken to the edge by mistaken identity.  Martin Sheen plays a father whose son is falsely accused of murder.  Sheen is frustrated by what he sees as his son's lack of direction and partying.  Torn between anger and his obvious love for his son, Sheen portrays the exasperation of so many fathers whose sons have still not found direction in their lives.  It is the age-old story of a young man struggling to find his own way, while his father just wants him to be like him.  Why can't he just settle down and take at job where his father works?  But the story takes a dramatic turn when the son is accused of murder.  At first anguished with doubt, Sheen finds himself fighting for his son, taking the law into his own hands, to prove his son's innocence.  The acting by both Sheen and the son is incredible and so true to real life.  The son is equally believable and engaging, played by Brendan Fraser.  If you are a Sheen fan, you already know the passion and intensity of this very gifted actor!  So make your popcorn before the movie starts, because you definitely won't want to hit the pause button on this movie!",1220918400,3,1156,4.380281690140845
8055672,4,B0008ENI34,"Presumed Guilty is a pretty decent movie about one man's relationship with his father, and how adversity brought them closer together. Based on a true story, its basically about the core elements of a family trying to stay strong while their son is in jail for a crime he didn't commit. Brendan Fraser plays Robert, a high school drop out, who at the age of twenty buys crack and drinks his life away on a lousy salarly from his pizza delivery job. Martin Sheen plays the foster father, who doesn't believe his adopted son is any good, but wants to love him nevertheless.

Their relationship comes to a head when a boy is murdered the particular night Brendan comes back home wasted. The only eye witness to the murder is a fifteen yr old boy, who swears Brendan was the one doing the killing. Although Brendan is clean, his card is accidently pulled from the police archives as someone elses with the same name. Just slightly different spelling. No one believes Brendan, not even his father until Brendan is convicted for the crime and sentanced to fifteen years at Sing Sing. Enraged, Martin Sheen tries to get Brendan out, but the damage has been done.

Martin goes to the police, but the homicide detective that sentanced Brendan refuses to admit the mistake even though he knows he was wrong. Not even the presiding Judge or sentancing Lawyer will admit their fatal mistake. Not until Martin pulls in his cop friend from out of the precint will anyone even begin to listen to him. So begins a five year Campaign to free his son, one that cements their father-son relationship and causes them to discover a friendship they never believed could or would exist.  Five years later, (and now twenty-five, buff and gorgeous) Brendan finally is given another trial. He is declared innocent and let out.

Rather long and drawn out, the picture gets fuzzy and the sound quality is pretty bad. Presumed Guilty is also one of Brendan's first movies, so its not the best of his works, also the accent he tries to do falters at times, and comes off more of a lisp than anything else. He's still sexy though, that will never change.

Martin Sheen is pretty good also, his scenes are done with a such finesse that when he cries one can actually feel the heartbreak he's trying to convey. A truly remarkable actor.

For both these actors and true fans of Brendan I recommmand this movie, however if you're just a casual Fraser fan i'd look elseware for one of his better movies.",1120694400,7,2467,4.621004566210046
