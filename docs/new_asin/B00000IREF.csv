Although it does not go to the menu when played, be sure to check out the menu options. ... my only additional wish.... an option to view the scenes with natural sounds and no music.",1157846400,3,271,4.76595744680851
8228111,5,B00000IREF,This is an excellent DVD to wind down to at the end of a stressful day or event.  Several beautiful places in the world are shown through scenes and gentle music accompany each scenic view.,1115769600,6,189,4.4
8228112,1,B00000IREF,"I thought this would make a nice video, teaching and showing different highlights of beautiful scenary across the world... I was wrong.
1)  The music is of poor quality.  Instead of finding a professional orchestra or other talented musical group, they have seemingly gone on the cheap.  It is not inspirational or dramatic by any means.
2)  The scenary is unrecognizable from anywhere else on earth. One could not possibly learn anything from it, and you do not feel you are ""on a visit"". You may be looking at the fields of Italy, but that's just it, it looks a lot like the fields of Wisconsin.  They failed to shoot the amazing and beautiful parts of the areas they filmed, instead opting for scenes more suitable for a comotose filled evening.
If you are looking for something interesting to watch or something showcasing the beauties of earth in music and visual presentation, this is not it.
I do not recommend this product.",1043712000,15,931,4.722222222222222
