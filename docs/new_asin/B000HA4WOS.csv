2632543,5,B000HA4WOS,"Add to that some of Malcolm In The Middle's humor, and you got one of the finest shows on TV. Chris Rock and Ali Roi have managed a witty show with characters many of us can relate to, well written plot lines, and some 80s nostalgia.",1165708800,5,233,4.086956521739131
2632544,5,B000HA4WOS,"With a great cast, funny plot line and a great narrorator, this show brings the comedy the TV has lacked since the ending of shows such as the fresh prince of bel-air and a different world, back to tv!",1164672000,,201,4.17948717948718
2632545,4,B000HA4WOS,"Comedian Chris Rock created Everyone Hates Chris. This show is a cross between American Graffitti and The Wonder Years.

What makes this show funny is the reason The Wonder Years were funny. A family show covering LIFE, real life-where there is so much humor.

It is worth it-YES. The humor crosses color lines and is worth it

2632546,5,B000HA4WOS,"I just purchased this DVD based on the few shows that I watched.  The show is about Chris Rock family and school life in his early teens. Anyone can relate to his family (the bratty youngest child, the perfect child, mom who can get over on dad anytime and the loving, but cheap father).

I loved every show!!",1160524800,3,309,4.310344827586207
2632547,5,B000HA4WOS,"This is one of the funniest shows around.  I really love it.  Chris Rock narrates, while actors act out the story of his childhood when he was 13 years old.  It's about Chris and his family moving out of the projects and making a new start.  Chris goes to school by himself to a good school in an Italian neighborhood (a real long haul) while his two siblings (younger brother Drew and younger sister Tonya go to their same school) so he has to learn to fight new battles as he tries to fit in.  His first day there he faces a bully but also makes a new friend Greg (who couldn't win a fight if he tried).  Back at home there is his dad Julius (played by the hilarious Terry Crews) and his take-no-nonsense mum Rochelle.  His dad is really tight and tries to save money wherever he can and however he can.

All the episodes are called Everyone Hates The ... and each episode keeps getting better and better.  To me, my favourite is episode 7 called Everyone Hates The Babysitter.  Julius and Rochelle decide to have a date night and hire this girl to babysit the three kids.  She always leaves the house to take care of her business.  That in itself is funny but then Julius and Rochelle are at a restaurant that doesn't accept their coupon and the restaurant gets robbed.

It's such a great show and you will be in stitches watching it.  Chris Rock narrates perfectly and you can see his life coming to life in each episode.  I love it and hope you enjoy it and are as entertained by it as much as I am.  I can't wait to get my copy.",1157155200,21,1534,4.219931271477663

2632561,5,B000HA4WOS,"I wanted to get this show on DVD simply because whenever I wanna watch it on tv, it's not on. So I bought season 1 and I gotta say I'm glad I did. For one,  Paramount did an excellent job with this release. It's in widescreen and it has an English 5.1 soundtrack (2. 0 also included) and it has some extras too. Also, this may not go over well with some people (especially die-hard fans of the show) but a lot of the licensed music in the show has been replaced with original music. Not a big deal to me. It's a funny family show, although there is some language in it. So hopefully this review helps.",1405814400,,601,4.093220338983051

2632572,5,B000HA4WOS,I purchased the First Season of Everybody Hates Chris for my 13 year old son.  He ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS SHOW and has watched the DVD's over and over.  He can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on DVD.,1262563200,,212,4.023809523809524
2632573,5,B000HA4WOS,"I bought season one of ""Everybody Hates Chris"" used at a pawn shop. The lady at the pawn shop let me have the first season for FIVE DOLLARS, so if I hated the show I wouldn't be out much money. Being a white male I wasn't sure I would like this show. I have liked somes shows with mostly black casts but not everything appeals to me. For instance, I never cared for Living Color or the Wayman brothers. However, back in the day I used to watch ""Good Times"" all the time. I also used to watch ""What's Happening"", even though it was not as good as ""Good Times"", imo.

Anyway, I must say I got my money's worth and more out of season one. All of the actors are talented. However, in season one I can't say that Chris' brother did much for me at all. I guess it is mostly a question of the concept of the character. That character is simply a chick magnet. That character simply doesn't have to do much. But the father, mother and little sister are all hillarious. I must say though that I think perhaps the mother got too much of a role in the first season, but if the father was always at work then I guess that was what life was all about, life with mom. I love how Chris accused his mother of being a ghetto snob. That is such a riot. The father is a penny pincher, a real cheapo, that is funny too, but not nearly as funny. And the story is so real at times that I feel like slapping the wife. I can just see Chris' mother quitting her jobs telling folks how her man has two or three jobs. And then the mother tries to work from home, another funny concept. I come away feeling sorry for the father though. I think the father is the hero of that family. I also like Chris' friend, he seems like a real buddy and all around good guy. I wanted to see Chris get even with the white red headed bully also, but that didn't happen in season one. Based upon season one I will look for the other three seasons. The show is real good fun. The one thing that got on my nerves in season one though is the THEME SONG. That song got very OLD very QUICK. I started skipping past the theme song because it was really getting on my nerves.

Anyway, if you haven't seen this show it is well worth your while. Also, Chris Rock is the narrator, of course, and it's really good fun to hear him narrate the episodes. Also, it is a who's who of black actor special guests on this show, folks like the guy who played J. J. Walker on Good Times, and the guy who played Raj on What's Happening and the guy who played Huggie Bear on Starsky and Hutch, aka, Antonio Vargas. Plus the black guy who was on The Mod Squad was a tenant in one of the episodes. It's fun to see all of these people who are now old.

Oh, and the funny perspective of this show is that it is a black guy's perspective of LIFE in a mostly white school. Chris was bused to a white school.",1259107200,,2834,4.048128342245989
2632574,5,B000HA4WOS,"i really liked this one - reminds me of my childhood, brings a lot of fun and warmth inside...actin crew is fantastic and real. thanks guys!",1256860800,,140,4.423076923076923
2632575,5,B000HA4WOS,I enjoyed watching these episodes - since I missed most of them when they were broadcast.  Funny content - especially the penny-pinching dad.,1215388800,,141,5.130434782608695
2632576,5,B000HA4WOS,"Tyler James Williams has the title role in this comedy gem, now in its second year on the CW Network. Creator (and narrator) Chris Rock has crafted a show that chronicles (with much ""poetic license"") his growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and paints a warmly humorous look at his family.

Williams is perfect as the boy that must deal with home life as the eldest that is held responsible for his younger siblings while dealing with a school where he is an oddity: the only Black person in the school. The latter allows Rock to mix comedy with social commentary, something that he does quite well.

The rest of the cast is fantastic. Terry Crews plays the stern and hardworking father, Julius; Tichina Arnold (formerly of Martin Lawrence's series) shines as the mother; Tequan Richmond is Chris's younger but larger and more-appealing-to-the-girls brother Drew; Imani Hakin is Keisha, the sister that makes life miserable for her older sibling; and Vincent Martella plays Chris's only friend at school, Greg.

The twenty-two episodes on the disc are self-explanatory and offer a sly nod to the show's premise by containing the words ""Everybody Hates"" in their titles (""Everybody Hates Basketball,"" ""Everybody Hates Sausage,"" "" Everybody Hates Food Stamps,"" and ""Everybody Hates the Gout,"" just to cite a few).

The compilation disc also contains cast commentaries on selected episodes and fascinating featurettes on the director/co-creator, the integral part that music plays in the show, and auditions, along with others.

The quality of the DVD is excellent and the show is presented in the widescreen format.

Hopefully, sales will be strong enough to persuade the release of season two at its end.",1179619200,2,1728,5.1535714285714285
