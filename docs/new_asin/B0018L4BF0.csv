8269929,5,B0018L4BF0,"I was looking for something that gave a basic educational overview of Reiki. The sources I was finding I felt were very watered down. Linda Haley's Introduction to Reiki was just what I was looking for! A lot of my questions were answered, and she didn't go off topic and push her own agenda as many of the resources I have found were. She also confirmed my suspicions about learning Reiki via distance learning. This was a very helpful resource.",1424044800,,446,4.5875
8269930,5,B0018L4BF0,"I wanted a general yet helpful introduction to Reiki Healing and that is exactly what I got in this DVD by Linda Haley.  The DVD explained the technique very well and answered all my questions.  The DVD is not intended to teach how to do Reiki so don't buy it if you want to become a practitioner. But if you want to learn about the system to see if it could you or someone you love, then by all means invest in this well-done DVD.",1236038400,5,431,4.0588235294117645
