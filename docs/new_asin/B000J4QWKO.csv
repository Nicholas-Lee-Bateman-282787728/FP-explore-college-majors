2666934,1,B000J4QWKO,"You can buy this set of 4 for $194.99, or you can buy all 4 separately for $142.90.  This makes no sense! Either the people at Amazon can't do math or they're hoping their customers can't!",1163203200,27,188,4.222222222222222
2666935,4,B000J4QWKO,"These days, with all the hype on television in cartoons from Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron, and the Fairly Odd Parents, many people have constantly forgotten about the classics from the past. I doubt a lot of people in this day of animation who watch cartoons have even seen The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, or the Charlie Brown. That also can definitely be said for the Looney Tunes gang as well. With all the upcoming hype of Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 4 coming up, many are starting to really rediscover the classics that've been arguably some of the most influential moments and themes in animation history from Bugs Bunny and company. But, for those who are starting to get interested in a real arrangement of the classics, can get them all for 1.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volumes 1-4 consist of over 230 different Warner Brothers classics all from the legendary Termite Terrace era. There ae so many great classics that are truly highlighted well, and they've been digitally remastered and restored visually for nearly all of them, where some of them from the first golden collection volume could've been remastered in the original musical tone like they've highlighted on VHS for several years. There are just so many great classic cartoons like Chuck Jones operatic masterpiece What's opera Doc?, the Oscar-winning Birds Anonymous, where Sylvester tries to quit cold turkey into chasing Tweety, Duck Amuck where a mischieveous mysterious animator, secretly Bugs Bunny, tries to make a outragoue cartoon of his own, and turn Daffy Duck into chicken, and The Bob Clampett gem, The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, where Daffy knocks himelf into a hilarious dream, as if he is Dick Tracy, going after hilarious villains like Neon Noodle. There are also numerous outakes, and highlights of specials and hidden reels of classics, and reflections through critics and influences like John K. on their feelings on these great classics.

All in all, if you haven't purchased any of the previous Looney Tunes Golden Collection volumes, you'll definitely love all four of these fantastic volumes on DVD, with all sorts of looney excitement. I absolutely still love these wonderful gems that have been so delightful and entertaining. I absolutely recomend this if you don't own any of the four volumes, otherwise, I'd recommend getting these volumes seperately. That's All Folks!!

2666936,1,B000J4QWKO,"Once again, Amazon has priced the complete (up to now, anyway) Looney Tunes Golden Collection Set HIGHER than if you bought them all individually.  They did this last year with the set of the first three volumes.  Now that volume 4 has come out, they've dropped the price of the three volume set to a reasonable price (actually quite a good deal).  For the best price on all 4 volumes at once, buy the three volume set and then buy volume 4 seperately.  Or wait until next year when volume 5 comes out and Amazon drops the price on this four volume set.  The one-star rating is for the price of the set.  The cartoons themselves are excellent and would earn a five-star rating if purchased at reasonable prices.",1161820800,47,711,4.4728682170542635
8149193,5,B000J4QWKO,"LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION VOL. 1: Ever notice that nearly every single major Looney Tunes star had some sort of a speech impediment or accent issue? Think about it...Elmer Fudd's was vewwwy pwominent. Daffy sprayed it when he said it. Tweety uttered baby talk, and Sylvester had the thloppietht lithp thith thide of Thindy Brady. The Tazmanian Devil rarely strung more than a couple of intelligible words together, Pepe Le Pew spouted fractured French...and I don't even wanna TALK about Porky Pig's problems. Only that fast-talking wascal Bugs Bunny escaped unincumbered in the diction department...he only spoke in brash Brookyln-nese, quite fitting for such a lovable stinker. My point, you ask? Quite simply, Mel Blanc's superhuman (supercritter?) voice characterizations ALONE would easily qualify this as the greatest collection of cartoon clowns, connivers, and crazies ever to grace celluloid. But that's not all, folks! Throw in directors extraordinaire Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Bob McKimson, magical musical maestro Carl Stalling, and the dozens of top-drawer animators and writers who made these 'toons so looney, and you've got 14 cawwot gold, Doc!
