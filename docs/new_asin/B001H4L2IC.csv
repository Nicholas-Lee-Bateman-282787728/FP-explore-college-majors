3622669,4,B001H4L2IC,"I rented this movie with no real expectations and I think that is the best way to approach it.  Not to say that expectations would have ruined the suspense and emotion, but they may have served to dampen the suspense somewhat.

This movie is centred on a man and wife who are devastated to learn that their young son will die without an expensive surgery that they cannot nearly afford.  Desperate, the wife places a 'help' ad in the local newspaper.

The husband is contacted by a mysterious man who agrees to pay him the sum needed if he agrees to kill a stranger who he assures the husband is an evil man who would not be missed.

The rest of the movie is the internal struggles of a man who is walled in by his conscience, his desperate wife, and his dying son.  What should he do?  How far can he go to save his son's life?

Possibly a spoiler, as I do not know how much is revealed on the DVD cover -

When the man does the unspeakable, the agony does not end there.  There are consequences and complications.  There are questions and emotions that are tangled together.  Why is one person's life worth more than another's?  What society deems a person's worth is based on their earnings, but to those who love them their worth has no price.

The visuals and the scenes in this film are well-crafted to show the difference between the wealthy and the poor.  An empty picture frame in a rich man's house costs more than the surgery needed to save the young boy's life.  Also, perhaps it signifies the emptiness one feels upon losing a loved one; or facing the prospect?

I highly recommend this movie.  It is not an action film by any means, but I was riveted the entire time.  The only things I found fault with were that I wished that the depth of the husband's anguish and feelings had been demonstrated to us rather than giving us merely a seemingly placid exterior, and that the relationship between him and his wife would have been less like a backdrop.  Or perhaps I missed something.  But I wish that there had been more between the two of them than was shown.

Still, this movie is very well worth your time.  Enjoy!  But do not expect to walk away from it with a light heart.",1354924800,4,2190,4.350617283950617
3622670,4,B001H4L2IC,"An excellent modern Noir, that poses the question 'how far would you go to save your child?. The interpersonal and psychological tension is perfectly echoed by the Belgrade setting where only the rich can obtain medical assistance and the rest are forced to beg or consider far more drastic action.",1284163200,2,298,4.98

Not only did the characters have a depressing life--outside of their son--but the idiotic, bad choices the lead character chooses are like something you warn your kids about...see, see, this is what happens when you don't think before acting!!  Not a feel good movie by any stretch...",1447632000,,313,5.019230769230769

8307767,5,B001H4L2IC,"Like the TV show ""Breaking Bad,"" it's a movie about what moral lines would you cross to protect your family.....however, unlike ""Bad,"" this film has no humor and is not a comedy.

8307770,2,B001H4L2IC,"Well acted, and suspenseful but tortuously, and relentlessly depressing. Half way through I had to restrain myself from jumping out of a window -- seriously.  I stuck with it because I wanted to see how it ended. I wish I hadn't.",1505952000,,229,4.585365853658536
8307771,5,B001H4L2IC,"It is hard to say anything about this film without revealing parts of the story. The acting, even that of the children, is stunning. The cinematography is unpredictable, beautiful, and takes a back-seat as it should. There is no one in American film who can hold a candle to the man playing the primary character.",1495929600,4,313,4.709090909090909
