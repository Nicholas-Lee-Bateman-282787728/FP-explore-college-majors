8389019,3,B0035HNMAA,"This is a good, thoughtful and intelligent miniseries. What blunts it's effect is two things in my mind. One, Fred Ward is a horrible actor. He is SO wooden and cliched in this that it is pathetic. His poor performance could be blamed on the writers and director if it wasn't for the fact that the other actors give reasonable performances with the material. Ward is just plain bad. Second, I felt that the development of the relationship between the male and female leads was pretty sketchy and contrived. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two and the idea that they were attracted to each other sexually just does not come across. I also thought that the writers took the Echoes out of the storyline too quickly. The series does have it's moments though and they keep the actual physical form of the evil ND's ambiguous all the wat through.",1298419200,,854,4.662251655629139
