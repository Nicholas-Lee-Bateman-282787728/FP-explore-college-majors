Challenging. If you want to see a difference in yourself, I highly recommend all of Sandra's DVD's",1364083200,,114,4.75
8523956,5,B0081ICCX6,"I recently read about Sandra Koularides' Horizontal Conditioning workouts on the Video Fitness forum, and was intrigued by what some folks over there described as really intense workouts.  I thought I'd give these a try, and so I ordered six of them -- and I love them so far!

Volume 1 relies on a lot of planks and full-body movements that really get deep into your core muscles.  I have a workout DVD collection of close to 300 DVDs, and yet the HoCo workouts are unique and unlike anything else I have in my collection.  Sandra has you go through a full range of movements that give you a full body workout, and I've found these workouts to be really addictive, perhaps because I feel so accomplished after doing one!

The set is nothing fancy on these volumes and the music is nothing to write home about, but Sandra herself is sweet and encouraging, and she makes you want to push yourself to work harder.  These remind me of being in a class at the gym, in the best possible way, where you feel like the instructor is there to help you keep going.

There is also a modifier in this workout, who usually will do the push-ups on her knees or use a bent leg instead of a straight one.  If you have bad wrists, I'd say to work up to the harder Volumes and start by doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horizontal-Conditioning-Getting-Started-DVD-with-Sandra-Koulourides/dp/B0081IFU58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horizontal Conditioning Getting Started DVD with Sandra Koulourides</a>&nbsp;until you build up more wrist and core strength.

For this Volume 1 workout, you'll need the following equipment:

* full-sized step with one or two risers on each side
* a mat
* a Body Bar or barbell bar (Sandra uses a 12-pound Body Bar, and I've been using my barbell)
* a three-pound weight

On her website, Sandra gives a recommended rotation for doing the four Volumes and the Boot Camp DVD.  She says to use each volume twice a week and the Boot Camp DVD once a week, with a day in between for cardio.  For instance, you would do HC V 1, cardio, HC V1, cardio, HC Boot Camp, cardio, rest.  If you're new to the HC workouts, she also provides advice about how to use the basic workout to gradually build up strength.

I definitely recommend these if you want to be challenged!",1344729600,9,2316,4.813131313131313
