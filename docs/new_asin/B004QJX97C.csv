8438238,2,B004QJX97C,"Russ Meyer's 1973 historical epic on slavery is something of a disappointment in that it does not follow the usual Meyer formula of beautiful powerful women , weak mean and cartoon violence to make its points. The film is very ordinary and could easily have been directed by any other director.

Meyer replaced the nudity so customary of his movies with strong doses of sadism. (All nude shots of the movie's star, Anouska Hempel, appear to have been provided by a body double.) Instead of focusing on the over-sexed life of a pneumatically-blessed heroine, Meyer gives us a cruel, sadistic plantation owner named Lady Susan. She owns an entire Caribbean island and she rules it with a leather whip, which she frequently applies to the backs of her slaves.

 Black Snake is interesting in that it anticipates the cycle of slave plantation based movies that would hit a few years later (epitomised by the acclaimed 1977 mini-series Roots and exploited in all-star sleazy trash like 1975's Mandingo ). It's also one of the few Russ Meyer films that never actually feels like a Russ Meyer film. The sleazy humour and cartoonish male characters are mostly absent, as are the trademark big breasts. For one of the few occasions, Meyer is not credited as the film editor, although from the cutting style on display it seems obvious that he gave Fred Baratta a strong guiding hand. Ultimately, Black Snake falls short as either drama, sleaze or sexploitation - there are elements of each, but not enough to make it all gel into one cohesive style. The film was not a box-office success and Meyer would never again try his hand at historical fiction.

This is another of those films for fans who need to see all of Meyer's films. Certainly not his best film it is still worth a viewing because of its complete forsaking of all of Meyer's usual touches.

Rent it. The DVD comes with no special features.",1337126400,,1894,4.74468085106383
