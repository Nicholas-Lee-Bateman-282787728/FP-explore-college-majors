8375457,5,B002NUYK9W,"Fortunately this production avoided any temptation to ""modernise"" the opera, something which some feel is necessary to bring productions into the 21st century. The costumes are timeless so one can concentrate on the singing, which is unifirmly excellent. Staging is minimal and in no way distracts from the musical message. My only reservations concern the ballet which, although the movements are appropriate to the music, comes across more as a demonstration of gymnastics than an artistic addition to the production. More appropriate costuming would have minimised this perception. This is one of the shortest Blu Ray operas in my collection at little over an hour, but is a quality production so worth the cost.

The video on this Blu Ray is absolutely stunning as is the audio.
