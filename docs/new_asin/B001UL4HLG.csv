This isn't the typical, boring and over used 5 second shots of a whale jumping out of the water or flapping it's finn, this is incrediblyup close and intimate underwater footage of a mother and her child and watching them interact, play and swim together is simply breathtaking.",1417046400,,438,4.628205128205129
8415208,1,B001UL4HLG,"It's a CHILDREN'S STORY about FICTIONAL whale CHARACTERS masquerading as a nature show about whales.

And it's not even an engaging or interesting story either.  It's slow, boring, repetitive, and nothing of consequence ever happens.  Ever.

So, in addition to being nearly worthless educationally, it's also completely worthless even just as mere entertainment.",1365724800,,362,5.773584905660377
