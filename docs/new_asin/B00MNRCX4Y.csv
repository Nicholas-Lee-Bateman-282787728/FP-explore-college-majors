6590420,3,B00MNRCX4Y,"The title says it all. The show itself was fine. What can I say, is a vampire show for children. No violence at all. Not really my cup of tea but it was fine. But the DVDs themselves were wonky. I had great difficulty going from episode to episode. Once you got to a given episode, the quality was fine but getting there could be a real chore. I found it very aggravating.",1485216000,2,372,4.109589041095891

6590423,5,B00MNRCX4Y,"This is such a good series.  It's funny, and not so bloody really considering the dad in it is Dracula.  I wish the series would go on and one, though.  I have watched it twice now.  I really miss not having BBC on my TV anymore.",1472083200,,229,3.9130434782608696

6590425,3,B00MNRCX4Y,"I love all things Vampires - not sorry I bought this, I just wish I had known it's made for kids.
Cute in a way, but not really what I wanted.
Next time I will pay better attention to the previews.
Well made, just not what I was expecting.
If you love Vampires like I do and you have Kids - you will like this!",1461715200,3,310,3.7846153846153845

6590427,5,B00MNRCX4Y,"A delightful British import, The Draculas come to England and set up shop. The Count, his son, Vlad, and daughter, Ingred. However, their lives are complicated by the Slayer's Guild, and the Vampire Community. Very well acted and well played by the cast, this series is well worth a look. If only Hollywood could  come up with ideas like this!",1456272000,3,343,4.716666666666667

6590429,3,B00MNRCX4Y,"I really didn't care for it. I couldn't get past watching the first three shows. I think it is a series for children to enjoy, but just too funny for adults who like the vampire genre.",1438732800,,184,4.138888888888889

8673263,5,B00MNRCX4Y,"As an adult, I actually really enjoyed this show!  The first season or two were a little goofy/campy but in a good way.  Then the series took a bit of a darker turn, more ""soap opera"" but I still really enjoyed it.  Had to get the DVDs for re-watching.

Oh, and Keith-Lee Castle?  Yeah, um, HOT to begin with.  That voice.  And just absolutely adorable as a nutty Count Dracula.",1493596800,,378,4.314285714285714

8673265,1,B00MNRCX4Y,DVDs seems ok but seasons one and two cases are cracked and broken looks like who is vet inspected it was drunk.,1487894400,,112,4.136363636363637
