1871270,5,B00008YLTJ,"There have been many portrayals of Sherlock but in my opinion, Jeremy Brett was the best. (Read about his dedication to the role, on Wickipedia) These Granada productions always visually excellent, locations spot on. Altogether a classy series and not to be bettered (in my opinion) by these modern remakes. To give proper due, prior to Jeremy, Basil Rathbone gave a good performance.",1355529600,,384,5.111111111111111

One of the detectives, Denis Lil was in a different voice for his character; quite different from his role as Major Benji in ""Mapp and Lucia"".",1503878400,,260,4.7555555555555555

7988156,5,B00008YLTJ,"Of all of the actors that I have seen portray Sherlock Holmes, it is my opinion that the late Jeremy Brett was the best, brilliant and believable.  For me, his is the closest to the author's that any actor has come in capturing the true essence of the World's Greatest Detective.  These episodes from the PBS series are well worth any fan's time, and are very illustrative to any newcomer to Brett's interpretation of Sherlock.  Jeremy Brett died far too young and is greatly missed, but Sherlock Holmes lives on!",1490572800,,513,4.677777777777778
