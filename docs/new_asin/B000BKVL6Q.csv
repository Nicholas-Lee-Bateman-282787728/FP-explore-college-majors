8088140,2,B000BKVL6Q,"Ordered specifically for closed captioning, which does not work.  Otherwise I think it's an excellent summary of the original show.",1484092800,,131,5.55
8088141,5,B000BKVL6Q,Excellent series with in-depth first person interviews. Highly Recommended!!!!!,1454025600,,79,7.888888888888889
8088142,2,B000BKVL6Q,"This DVD is the same as the A&E version ,just different narrators. The documentary on this topic is boring which it should not be. Considering the Death and devastation the plague caused in the 1340s, this should of been a lot better production . If you are interested in this topic I wouldsuggest you buy ""the Plague"" history channel  that version is excellent 5 stars , I watched it many times and it is always a pleasure to watch. It has excellent reenactors and interviews, not this version though.",1385769600,,502,4.640449438202247
8088143,5,B000BKVL6Q,"The History Channel produced this DVD on the Black Death (or the Plague).  It gives plenty of information and is great for history buffs, especially teachers of World Civilizations or World History courses.  Although there are lots of YouTube videos on this topic, the History Channel original is the best, in my opinion.",1377734400,,321,5.037735849056604
8088144,5,B000BKVL6Q,"I am very facinated with the Black plague and this DVD is very informative. It has everything the old classic History channel documentories have: first hand accounts from the people who lived through it (written in diaries), classic art of the era, depicting the hardships they went through, showing and describing the stages of the plague and the personal hardships endured. There are also dialogs from teachers, scientists and experts which really tell the complete story from begining to end.
I have watched this at least five times and am considering it once again. If you like the classic documenteries of the classic History channel that actually involve HISTORY(not hicks catching alligators,or other reality b.s.), than you will love this.",1336176000,2,747,5.233333333333333
8088145,2,B000BKVL6Q,"I can't believe that this dvd don't have sub-titles or close caption....just English spoken language, WHERE IS THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE HANDICAPPED?",1247011200,2,149,5.818181818181818
8088146,2,B000BKVL6Q,"This was beneficial in that one learns how individuals dealt with the Plague.  Some flagellated themselves; others boarded up whole families to die; really stupidly, others turned to anti-Semitism.  Before this, I falsely assumed that like tuberculosis in the 1800s, many people died but at their own pace and acceleration.  This work said the Plague killed within 5 days.  In fact, it adds that victims were forced to smell their own flesh rot.  I usually hate cheesy reenactments, but this work kept them to a minimum; more elaborate reenactments would have been too costly, I suppose.  The paintings were so ornate, I doubt they were done in the 1300s.  My big critique of this work is that though it says, ""The Plague flew from Italy all the way to the Arctic,"" 95% of this work focused on Italy.  Often when a new disease arrives, people blame it on foreigners.  (Historically, this was true of syphilis, centuries later.)  Did other Europeans blame the Italians for the Plague?  Were other countries able to learn to fight the Plague using Italians' tactics?  This work stated that the Plague would pop up to a smaller extent until the 1700s; didn't know that.  Only in the 1800s did scientists learn that it was spread from fleas and mice.  This work said very little, and only near the end, about the filthiness of 1300s Europe.  I heard that people of the time killed cats, viewing them as ""the devil's beast,"" until they saw that cats ate infected mice.  This work says nothing of it.  I recently saw a documentary on the flu outbreak of 1918.  Just like the Plague, huge percentages of people died and then the flu disappeared.  As tragic as both events are, it also gives me the impression that the weak die off and the strong survive.  This wasn't genocide or extinction, just really virulent diseases that luckily humans overcame.  This work may be good for high school and junior high history classes.",1164844800,9,1916,4.745454545454545
