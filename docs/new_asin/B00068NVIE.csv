8701917,1,B00068NVIE,"Yes... I said it, love for animals in a demented way!!

I selected this documentary because I believed it to be normal folks just giving that ever-loving attention to their pets. How wrong I was, and when I thought it would be a different foreign film documentary, it proved to be different all right! The German documentary features the people from the bowels of society, the desperate, pathetic rejected and lost souls with obsessive, freakish and bizarre behavior with their pets.

The documentary does not tell you what is going on, nor does it explain anything at all.  You are to assume that pet ownership takes all kinds.
The documentary is low-budget, with depressing people in depressing areas and depressing situations.  The crew follows a homeless loser in love and he takes on a rabbit for company, he can't take care of himself, but begs money for the rabbit. He later ....omg... darts his tongue into that of a dog!  Two men living together become obsessed with a dog, can't train him correctly, can't take on society, but their life is this dog.

One homely woman's husband has left her, and she wishes him dead.  She takes way too much comfort in the dog.  And this film includes footage of women who at some time replace men in their lives with dogs and I do not have to tell you what that is about, look up zoophilia.

Rabbits are put at the bedside of elderly. Not sure if anyone is comforted here. There are long shots of nothingness, people just staring for a lengthy time. There is nudity, and one couple who advertise for swinging, have sex. A man makes a sex call and parades around in his undies.

This is about as bizarre as one can get with pet obsession. And although there is bestiality in our lives, a few of these people obviously take it to that level, but not in front of the camera.  At times some stories at extended and we do not know exactly why except to reveal the complete strangeness.

If you adore your pets and have some form of normalcy, this is not for you. It is not graphic or very disturbing, just ugly and bizarre, and for heaven's sake do not let the kids see this......Rizzo.",1299542400,3,2126,4.5078125
