8254822,1,B0014A87Q4,Not the kind of low-quality movie making that Amazon Prime should be even listing.,1467849600,,82,4.928571428571429
8254823,1,B0014A87Q4,"There is no plot. The actors can't act. And the women are fat or old or ugly or all three. The only cute one gets offed early in the film for no apparent reason. She's in a bikini in a hammock, bad dude walks up puts his hand over her mouth, bad dudette whips out a knife and rips her gut open. Why? No clue. When they get to the house, the first woman bad dude rapes could be his grandmother. Huh? As for the effects, I have two words: What effects? This film has no redeeming value. Period. My title says it all.",1342051200,2,514,3.951923076923077
8254824,1,B0014A87Q4,"This movie was a waste of film.  The plot was non-existant, dialog not more than a constant stream of profanities, and I've seen better effects at a pre-school play.  Run from this turkey!!!",1218412800,,190,4.7272727272727275
8254825,1,B0014A87Q4,"Don't be fooled by the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" in the title...this piece of trash, which has the appearance of a home video, was obviously made without direction, writing, editing, acting talent, or even 20 dollars in the budget. Gory?  Half the budget was spent on Cherry Kool-aid to simulate blood.  Nothing in this movie--not one second of it--is the least bit entertaining, convincing, realistic or worthwhile.  We are supposed to believe that because the female victims of a group of male prison escapees who invade their domestic abuse shelter inevitably turn the tables on their tormentors, the film somehow makes a ""statement"".  Here's a better statement--don't waste your time or money on this cheap, insulting drivel.",1216598400,7,728,5.25
8254826,1,B0014A87Q4,This movie was so bad I couldn't bear to watch more than 10 minutes of it. It was a major disappointment and a waste of money to rent.,1211500800,3,134,3.8214285714285716
8254827,1,B0014A87Q4,"This movie is total trash.  The cover is misleading, this movie was not graphic, I have seen worse in r rated movies.  The acting was bad. The violence and so called sexual acts were a joke.  Don't waste money on this movie, it is not worth 2 cents.",1211155200,2,249,4.145833333333333
