I watched a large portion of this picture being filmed as I lived nearby and there are passing scenes of my property in the film. It was totally enjoyable and a novelty. The cars and scenery were fabulous. A local friend of mine that owned an antique dealership nearly sold out to the property agents in the movie for props.

If you have the opportunity to see this movie do so, I believe you will enjoy it If you find it on a rental take it home.

It also shows a pretty good shot at an important piece of Americana.",1398124800,,690,4.212121212121212
