8030736,3,B0002QPRPK,It was okay. It is the usual black play. I was disappointed in the ending though...,1418860800,,83,4.25
8030737,1,B0002QPRPK,Not so good,1408406400,,11,3.0
8030738,2,B0002QPRPK,Amateur over acting.  Sound quality horrendous ! Sounds like school auditorium. Camera shots sometimes out of focus and / or too close. Good storyline is the only  reason I watched the entire play. Would not want to watch again due to the poor quality making it laborious to watch. Looks like there was no review of taping before producing Dvd. Leaves me on the fence on my decision to buy another of her productions due to this poor decision. Next time I 'll wait for others to review. Not worth  purchasing this one at any cost.,1392508800,,530,4.5
8030739,1,B0002QPRPK,"I've seen a few Shelly Garrett plays and generally, I like them. This one, however, is for a different region, and I can't view it... Case says it came from Mexico. When I put it into the DVD, I get an invalid region error. It's not worth the money to send it back, so I'll just eat this one...",1391644800,,294,4.0

8030742,5,B0002QPRPK,"The national hit stage play.

A battered wife is accused of killing her husband, but did she do it?  Who is she protecting?  Find out in this humerous, but ultimately dramtic production.",1348704000,,186,4.75
8030743,1,B0002QPRPK,"This stage play title, ""Battered Love"" is very good. The ending is ?????,
but you have idea who did it. Great to have in your collection.",1184716800,2,137,4.3076923076923075
8030744,1,B0002QPRPK,I couldn't get into this play because the audio is so bad with an echo or something that I couldn't understand what was being said.  I think somebody forgot to preview the DVD quality before distribution.,1182297600,3,204,4.666666666666667
