8136517,3,B000H5TT96,"I'm a HUGE fan of spaghetti Westerns but I'm not sure I should leave even 3 stars, most my
ratings for these  sw's are 5 stars.
If you were around in the 70's you might remember Charles Manson the super psychotic
murderer (Sharon Tate murders), this is a movie he would write and produce.
The cast is good, there I said something nice about it........",1513468800,,351,4.4
8136518,2,B000H5TT96,"Interesting ideas, incoherently executed. I liked the experimental soundtrack. My litmus test is whether I'd buy a DVD or just watch the film. For weird westerns, the best are Tomas Milian's Django Kill & El Topo.",1499126400,,213,4.944444444444445
8136519,2,B000H5TT96,One of the most unusual and brilliant italian I have ever seen.  The final with the boomerang has clearly inspired George miller for The Road warrior / Mad Max 2.,1336780800,,162,4.4
8136520,1,B000H5TT96,"If you're looking for a bizarre, violent, psychedelic western, with an amazing soundtrack then this movie is for you!  Unfortunately, this DVD version suffers from constant heavy compression artifacts (or ""blocky"" pixelization that is especially noticeable in the bright out of focus shots and darker scenes) not dissimilar to bargain-bin, dollar DVD's.

This is one of the most disappointing DVD's in recent memory (especially with a $20 price tag) that should be avoided unless you have absolutely no other way to see the film.",1211414400,4,529,5.285714285714286
8136521,5,B000H5TT96,"I've seen many spaghetti westerns in my time, and after viewing this one for the second time, I've gotta say this is definitely the strangest western to my viewing, with the exception of ""Django, (If You Live Shoot)"". For you die-hard collector's of the genre like me, ""Matalo!"" is a must, with exceptional acting, excellent cinematography, and a pleasant introduction to sexy actress, Claudia Gravy, (I was not familiar with her until this film.) The film is hard to explain without giving away the plot or action, won't say more except ""undescribable"", sort of a twilight zone western, kick back and see for yourself, a Wild East dvd, 16x9 widescreen, MATALO!, there is another version of this wild spaghetti, ""Kill The Wicked"", available on a wild east double feature release... and it may fare just ""slightly"" better... 'cept there's no Claudia Gravy.",1210636800,4,855,5.028169014084507
