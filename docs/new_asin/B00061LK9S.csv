8324826,3,B00061LK9S,Good messages and believable performances. A small budget film but produced and directed fine taking that into consideration Shows how God can change lives.,1391385600,,156,5.541666666666667
8324827,5,B00061LK9S,"Great movie; very inspiring.  The best part is the story.  Lots of other movies go all out on things like special effects and such, then miss the part about a great story that makes you think.  Lot's of subplots keep the movie very interesting.  I would definitely recommend this movie.",1302480000,3,286,4.66
8324828,1,B00061LK9S,"This film is like a poor middle school production.  The lighting, acting, and writing were horrendous.  The story of a boring man whose only claim to preaching is a literal and unenthusiastic interpretation. It is a stereotype of people who think they can read the Bible anyway they want to.  I wouldn't bother showing this film -- if it can be called one -- to my dog.  It would inspire a believer of Jesus to become an atheist. I would ask for my money back, but then I would have to let people who know my real name know that I purchased it.  If you want true knowledge of the change Jesus can make in one's life, watch Benji.",1133481600,3,629,4.2521008403361344
8324829,5,B00061LK9S,"""Objects of Wrath"" causes you to face some hard questions.  Who hasn't thought, ""Am I doing what God has planned for my life?""  The cast of characters in this production all deal with this very same question.  We are allowed to see what happens when faith and trust become the main focus to a person's life.  This is a movie about celebrating God's grace and the realization of God's love. The cast of characters are all unique yet seekers all the same.  This movie reafirms that people can still make a difference when guided by God's hand.",1097539200,7,541,4.536082474226804
8324830,4,B00061LK9S,"""Objects of Wrath"" is a very uplifting and thought-provoking movie.  It deals with issues that many of us can identify with and shows how to seek help in a very good place.  This movie can inspire people to look at their own life and question whether they are living the way they should and what they should do to take action to correct their path.  The movie has very good production values for something made on a shoestring budget.  You can tell the director put a lot of thought and effort into the film.  I mean, if you're looking for Spiderman then go somewhere else.  But if you'd like a movie with a good story and a real message then I recommend ""Objects of Wrath"".",1097452800,8,674,4.352
