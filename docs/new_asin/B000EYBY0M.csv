2546227,5,B000EYBY0M,"My three year old son loves the whole Boz series.  Think high quality computer animation coupled with cute songs and great spiritual values.  Within the context of a cute Christian family, this particular video takes the opportunity to view colors and shapes as fun and interesting elements of God's creation without being cheesy or boring.  The songs are easy to pick up and sing along with and the characters are adorable and easily likeable.  Boz definitely stands out in the Christian kids' video arena, and we hope he's here to stay awhile.",1167868800,,545,4.891304347826087
2546228,5,B000EYBY0M,"I purchased this DVD primarily for my 18 month old son.  I thought he would enjoy it as he grew older if it was too advanced for him now.  Turns out that both he and my 5 year old son love the videos and ask for it daily!

The storyline is centered around the relationship between a large green bear who lives next door to 4 year old twin brother and sister and their mother and father.  I appreciate the interaction between the parents, grandparents, and twins as well.  Sadly, the family unit has been demeaned in mainstream children's shows.  Either the parents are missing entirely (Barney, Out of the Box, etc.) or, for older kids' shows, the parents are depicted as stupid or detached (Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Odd Parents, etc.).  This series does an excellent job of depicting balanced, loving, supportive parents who are also positive authority figures in the twins lives.

Boz is the bear's name.  He is very upbeat, energetic, and positive.  Some parents might find this annoyingly so, but, in my opinion, the video is designed for preschool aged children and it certainly seems to appeal to my children very much.  My 5 year old watches the videos with a sweet smile (no kidding!) on his face as he experiences the show with them.  By the way, my son has seen (and enjoyed) Sponge Bob and Jimmy Neutron, yet he asks for Boz more than anything else.

The value based educational stories are very sweet and well done.  This is a Christian video, so there are references to God and faith.  The references to God are loving and appropriately interspersed throughout the stories.  The subtle references are nice.  My son loved finding the cross in the twins' bedroom.  The faith references are balanced and (in my opinion) realistic.  For instance, along with the cross on their bedroom wall, there are pictures that the children have drawn of super heroes.  The focus is not exceedingly on God, instead God is viewed as a normal part of a normal life and referred to at appropriate moments.  The primary focus of the inclusion of God is to reinforce how much God loves us.

As for the music, I'll warn you, the songs are very catchy.  I catch myself singing them throughout the day whether I want to or not!  My 5 year old has found them easy to learn and sing along with too.  The music has a full, professional sound.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the video.  The animation is similar to that used in Disney's ""Monsters, Inc.""  It is well done.  The body movements and facial expressions are appropriate and quite realistic.

Overall, I am pleased with the videos.  I would recommend them to any conscientious parent who is interested in their child developing a positive view of God and faith while learning and being entertained in the process.",1153612800,16,2771,4.651546391752578
2546229,5,B000EYBY0M,"My child loves this DVD & can't get enough! He sings the songs, dances to the music, and says ""more boz"" when it ends. I love the educational elements, the family values, focus on good nutrition, community service, and social interation (sharing, playing well with other children). Great series!!!",1152576000,,297,5.081632653061225
2546230,5,B000EYBY0M,"My 2 yr old LOVES Boz!  They are superb for providing entertainment in a calm style while instilling great values and teaching the basics (colors, shapes, numbers) at the same time.",1145923200,5,181,4.838709677419355
2546231,4,B000EYBY0M,"**UPDATE** (Aug. 19, 2006) My intention wasn't to down the series or be ""mean spirited"" I do appreciate the series, and yes, I notice that the children pray. I still reccommend this series. I, myself, was a child who loved to watch movies over and over like my son does now. He constantly watches Thomas the train, and all that, and he is currently on a ""Veggie Tales"" kick, which I NEVER get tired of. I still watch the same favorite movies of mine frequently as well.

I do like Boz. I later found out that Boz, indeed, was fashioned after Barney by people who had created/worked with Barney previously. So, while Boz isn't Barney himself, he does have some similar traits and demeanors.... not that that's bad, mind you.

If this review has been perceived negatively, I would like to clarify that it wasn't my intention, and I truly do support this series. My son has actually watched it a few more times and has taken a better liking to it as well.

***

My first impression of this whole new series was great. I appreciate the teaching of good Biblical principles into childrens' videos and depicting healthy relationships of friendship and family. The songs are also very sweet, catchy, and delightful.

With that in mind, I think that some of the rest of the things that are added are a little overdone and could do without. The ""Barney Factor"" isn't really needed here. (Meaning: the singing and dancing and excessive happiness) With kids, all you need to do is keep it simple and don't overdo the enthusiasm. Make it realistic and happy, but not so happy that it's hyperactive. The kids like it, but keep it in perspective, especially if you want the parents to keep buying the series. The parents won't want to buy it if it's extremely corny and annoying to them. It should appeal to a universal audience, and be tolerable and enjoyable, like Veggie Tales and Thomas the Tank Engine, and stuff.

It would also be nice to have a little more ""real life"" conflict. Have the kids show a wider range of emotions other than just ""insanely happy because life is always perfect in their little world."" The kids and the people all act a little too ""perfect."" That really hurts the authenticity of family dynamics.

These videos really reflect what we do and teach at home and how we relate as a family, but it would be nice to see how the family works through conflict, not just when things are always perfect, like in this world of Boz.

I like the Boz concept, but it would almost be richer if Boz could be more easily relatable. I like the mentor figure, but most kids aren't going to have a crazily happy bear to teach them. It would be neat to have maye a nice older neighbor to help mentor them and pass on Godly wisdom too.

Bottom line is this video series is great, and worth purchasing, but they should take it easy on the ""kiddie crack"" as some people call it. Keep it simple and real and don't overdo it. They will still learn just as much. You don't need to hype them up until they tire themselves out and pass out. Don't take out the music and fun, but keep it in perspective in order to keep and retain the audience and keep them coming back for more and not saying, ""I can only take so much.""",1144368000,9,3209,4.4438775510204085

2546239,5,B000EYBY0M,"Now, you may be thinking
""Oh No NOT another Barney! One was too many!""
Look, there's a lot more to this show than that. This is twice as educational, twice as fun, its colorful, and your kid will probably enjoy it.
Assuming your a:
Christian who loves God that is.
If you ARE NOT---!
This may not be for you. I won't be the one to infringe on others beliefs here. I will expect you to do the same.

This DVD was made by ~Christians~, to be both educational and express good values, while still being fun for the little ones. Adults will not find this movie/ show very entertaining(you will be bored mostly), like other animated movies might entertain, but its not really supposed to, it is wholesome good entertainment for the little ones you have running around.

Good for young ages starting at around 1yr and older.

The Christian values in this DVD aren't overly done, but they do Pray, as all Christians do/should, and God is mentioned a couple of times, and songs are sung about him once or twice. If this offends you DONT BUY IT. Its quite simple really.

This is my opinion, based on the facts I understand. I hope your little ones enjoy it as much as mine do.
Thanks for reading.",1391904000,,1188,4.410958904109589

2546244,5,B000EYBY0M,My toddler (23months) loves this video. He has never been interested in any type of TV or DVDs and would never watch anything for more than 1 or 2 mins. We do not offer to let him watch much but we got this video as a gift and gave it a try. He loves the amount of songs and music. He gets up and dances and laughs. And I love that his little eyes and ears are filled with God's word too instead of the junk offered to kids on TV.,1364256000,,430,3.7362637362637363

2546250,5,B000EYBY0M,"I have this title along with ""Friends & Helpers"", and ""Singing with BOZ"".  My daughter loves all of them. She was a very clingy baby (still is), but when I put in these DVDs, she barely looks up at me.  She can immediately recognize when I put the DVD into the player from the flash screen.  She kneels up in the bed and begins to bounce and jump excitedly. I rated it 5 stars just for this alone. I also intentionally went looking for faith-based DVDs and not the ones just to make her smarter.  I found that these DVDs had all of the things that I want my daughter to learn. About God, praying, colors, shapes, sharing, helping, etc.  I would recommend this series to anyone.

I have to say that as an adult, many of the movies/shows that are made for kids can get very grating, especially the songs.  The songs in Boz haven't bugged me one bit, at least yet.  If you haven't ever gotten one of these videos for your children, what are you waiting for?  Boz and the whole cast are great role models for all kids.",1470528000,,467,4.087912087912088
8115755,3,B000EYBY0M,"I have only watched the ""Counting on God's Love"" so far and it was very cute and colorful with good messages. But what isn't good is that it isn't about Jesus. In the ""Counting on God's Love"" episode the kids count 5 ways God shows He loves us and 5 ways we can show we love God.

All of the ways were very sweet but what about the big one? God shows He loves us because He sent Jesus, His only Son, to save us from our sins! I was really expecting that to be in there but it wasn't at all. Instead the 5 ways are things like because God gave us flowers and trees, and eyes to see, and all that. Which, yes, is a way God's love and magnificence is shown in the world. But these are such small things compared to the the most important way God shows us He loves us. Jesus wasn't mentioned ONCE.

On the other end of it, how we can show that we love God there were some good messages. But I think obeying God's Word should've been in there. Not once was a Bible pulled out to read what God ASKS us to do to show Him we love him. Jesus tells us in John 14:15 how to love Him - ""If ye love me, keep my commandments."" It's as simple as that. Even a toddler could understand.

I'm not COMPLETELY writing these off...yet. I've only watched two episodes so far and they seem to have a good message and geared towards toddlers, which is nice. But I'm not entirely sure if they're actually CHRISTIAN. So far they don't seem to be introducing Jesus at all, which is really sad to me because that's THE BEST part! Not to mention the most crucial part! They might be good DVDs for learning the practical things like colors and shapes, but for the important concepts about God, Jesus, and salvation, it might be dangerous to use for that. It might be too old for toddlers but for those things I highly recommend Theo, which does a great job of introducing those concepts in a simple, yet accurate manner.",1452556800,2,1890,4.158469945355192
8115756,4,B000EYBY0M,My boys  enjoy it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I noticed that the shapes they call squares in the shape section are rectangles most of the time.
