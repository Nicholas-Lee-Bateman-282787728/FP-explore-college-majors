2928479,5,B000V1Y44Q,"The second DVD set includes many favorites episodes of mine (Save the Tiger, Last Horizons, The Old Man and the Sea Duck, My Fair Baloo, Jolly Molly christmas...and so many more!)

This series is the best TV series ever produced. The series can appeal to everyone, boys and girls, kids and adults (something that Disney is REALLY lacking nowadays) : it has funny situations and deals with serious matters (sometimes both in the same episode, and it works very well) In fact, EVERYONE who has seen the series later as an adult think it's even better than when they were kids!!! Check around the web if you don't believe me. (and nostalgia has nothing to do with that, unlike most cartoons!)

It has the greatest characters ever made : they have a real depth and multi-sided personalities, which is not very common for cartoons. Even the characters coming from the Jungle Book (especially Baloo and Shere Khan) are much more interesting in TaleSpin! The soundtrack is the best Disney has ever produced for a series. The episodes are very varied, it's never repetitive (which is the biggest flaw of most cartoons nowadays, especially Phineas & Ferb) and the art is magnificent (characters styles and sceneries are a mix of the best of American and Japan animation!)

The only ""flaw"" would be the sometimes inconsistent animation, due to several production facilities, but the animation is still top notch overall.

It's probably the most underrated Disney production ever, due to them never really backing it unfortunately. It's already a miracle they've released the TaleSpin DVDs! I would really love Disney to come back to it and make a direct-to-video film or even (let's dream) a feature film. It truly deserves it. There are so many great TaleSpin stories that could be told...

NB : If you only have the first set, I REALLY recommend getting this one because it's even better! Pure masterpiece.",1284595200,4,1898,4.900311526479751
2928480,5,B000V1Y44Q,"While it is great to see a second volume come out, I would really appreciate if Disney would release ALL episodes of Talespin.

Sadly, this box set doesn't have any added features or interviews from those who helped create this masterpiece 17 -short- years ago.

2928543,5,B000V1Y44Q,"This cartoon series was one of my favorite after-school shows on the Disney afternoon. One of the aspects I loved about it was the the pseudo-period style in which it was set. Even as a child, I loved the old-fashioned, art deco influence in the animation, the small quaint shop of Baloo and Rebecca offset by the large art deco buildings of the city in the background. Cape Suzette is visually similar to a sleepy island town on a seaside, like what you would find in a Fellini film. The planes and boats are all old-fashioned World War style planes that exude a certain old-world romantic flair (reminiscent of Casablanca or the African Queen). I also love the laugh-out-loud moments of this series. Rebecca and Baloo's back and fourth can get quite witty, and the Don Carnage character (the villain) has great one liners given in an undeniably hysterical accent. What I love most about this series though is that its main theme is that of friendship and maintaining normal social balances between different sects of society, working together to achieve goals, and enjoying fun while doing good hard work. It's something that all kids, old and young can appreciate. One of my favorite episodes (on the first volume) was one where Rebecca is conned into hauling ""expensive"" jewels for a snobby, seemingly nouveau-riche couple. Of course, she bends and kowtows to them all the while the couple treats her and Baloo like dirt. Baloo of course saw through their snobbery and, in the end, he and Louis reveal them as the scam-artists they were. Albeit over-dramatized, it's a good lesson to be learned, not to get sucked into the superficial and to stand your ground against those who treat you poorly without due cause. Each episode presents non-controversial, all-American morals and standards that even the most liberal or conservative of people can understand. There are also other, just plain awesome episodes too, like the one where Baloo and Louis visit some Egypt-inspired dessert valley and help the pretty young gal uncover a lost city controlled by bells. The mystery, ethos and pathos, and a general interesting storyline taking place in beautiful animated locations is always present in this series. There really isn't an episode (that I can remember) that I didn't enjoy thoroughly enjoy.

To finish up, I was watching some new kids show with my 9 year old about mermaids. It was good, but I noticed that the show didn't exhibit the same stand-up qualities that these old programs had. Most kids shows today have their characters walking around in skimpy, fashionable outfits, saying niche popular phrases, and not really doing anything of real value to the society in which they reside. The male characters are always buffed out to the max, wearing open shirts and looking dreamy. It's certainly entertaining from a Hollywood perspective, but is it really what we want our kids to be watching before they're 18? I would say no, and thus my recommendation for Tale Spin. At the very least, I am very excited to introduce my nieces and nephew to this show. I really think they're going to love it!

Thanks and I urge anyone to purchase it!",1431561600,4,3149,4.873134328358209
