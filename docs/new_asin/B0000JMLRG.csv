Anything from the And 1 series is definitely better.  If you're into seeing ankle breakin' crossovers, tricks and passes don't get this.  Granted there are a lot of dunks, but they could've put everything really on one DVD because there's only about 15 min of basketball footage total that just gets recycled over and over again.  And the thing is that 15 min is so damn boring!  It's like you could've made the same video yourself just going to your local spot where people ball.",1096848000,11,631,4.73394495412844
