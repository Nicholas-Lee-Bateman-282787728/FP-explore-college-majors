2664365,4,B000IZJZBW,"My son and his friends find this hilarious.  A bit too adult content for my 13 year old daughter.  I found it funny, too.  Off beat humor.",1179187200,,138,4.037037037037037
2664366,5,B000IZJZBW,"The first Dr. Tran video I was ""Here Comes Dr. Tran"".  This is an excellent DVD.  Absolutely worth buying.",1171929600,,106,4.526315789473684
8147954,5,B000IZJZBW,A gift for one of my daughters.  She enjoys it very much.,1404259200,,57,3.75
8147955,5,B000IZJZBW,Great shorts and funny storylines but too adult for even someone that is an adult! It's just my opinion and I'm 18 and this movie left me speechless and I couldn't believe what happens in this video! The youtube versions of this series is mature rated but this dvd is just plain wrong in it's entertainment choice. If you like jokes about sexual body parts and silly wreckless killing of children then this is for you! I thought i have seen it all but now after watching this I know now I hadn't! I liked this movie for the Dr. Tran episodes but the extra shorts are a bit much! so Dr. Tran is numbuh 1! and the shorts are numbuh 2 poo! That's clean compared to the kinda humor in this movie. Totally recommend to everyone over 18!,1271980800,,731,4.266187050359712
8147956,5,B000IZJZBW,"I really find it too bad that people who didn't see this at Spike 'n Mike's will miss out on the 3D-glasses gag.  I still have my glasses from the festival.  Seeing the audience reaction reel really brought me back to when I first saw this little (faux-South Asian) gem.

Quiet log time has what I feel to be one of the best punchlines ever delivered by an animated rooster.  There are just so many joyful moments.

Only show this to minors if you want to discourage their consumption of Tex-Mex food.",1207094400,,501,4.4021739130434785
8147957,5,B000IZJZBW,"Wow, with a pleasant mixture of the macabre, the bizarre, and the disgusting, this is certainly a DVD that you do not want to miss!

The awesome bonus features and easter eggs alone justify the low price.

8147958,5,B000IZJZBW,"This is a great buy for those who enjoy somewhat senseless, outrageous comedy. This DVD is packed with various shorts produced by Beyond Grandpa. If you weren't already referred to Amazon from the website to buy this DVD, visit beyondgrandpa.com to preview part of the original Dr. Tran. It is mainly based for adult humor.",1196899200,,323,4.890909090909091
8147959,5,B000IZJZBW,"I was first introduced to Dr. Tran at Spike & Mike's animation festival. Funny, funny stuff. The DVD includes some of the ""Beyond Grandpa"" series which is a bit disturbing, but also funny. I absolutely recommend this! My favorite is quiet log time.

Not for kids!",1195948800,,263,4.717391304347826
8147960,5,B000IZJZBW,"I hate to say it, but I actually use this for my animation class to show my students what a good script and simple animation can do.  The animation for ""here comes dr. tran"" is simple, clean, and really feeds to the script.  Its a thing of beauty.  The other Dr. Tran episodes are mostly spot on, with a few places that it felt like they were digging for time.  ""Mr. Tran and the Toy Cack"" is probably more disturbing, and feels a bit off the ""dr. tran"" idea at first, but its so over the top that its a joy ride from start to finish (a joy ride with excessive blood!).

Definately not for children.  I would highly recommend this for the extras, the additional animations from lone sausage, and I hope they grace us with a vol 2 soon!",1182902400,2,735,4.177304964539007
8147961,4,B000IZJZBW,"Dr. Tran: Number One American Icon is a collection of the first Lone Sausage cartoons. After having seen a few of them in Youtube, I loved them and had laughed. Ordering the DVD was no disappointment. I laughed, and nearly cried at Dr. Tran's Summer Splash, I giggled at Mr. Tran & Toy Cack, snickered at Roybertito's and vomited at Beyond Grandpa.

5 Stars!!",1182816000,,359,4.609375
8147962,5,B000IZJZBW,"This is #1 of the over 30,000 Dr. Tran DVD titles only now becoming available! Dr. Tran is the greatest American hero from America! Included in the DVD is an ad for a mexican food restaurant and some other stuff about grandpa, but you'll keep coming back for more and moar Dr. Tran!

Some parts may have been seen in the Spike & Mike Sick & Twisted animation series, but this is the whole Lone Sausage collection. If you haven't seen it, your life will be empty and shallow. With it, all is lightness and joy.

Note: this material was featured in the Sick and Twisted animation festival and is not for little kids, or the faint of heart.",1182816000,3,637,4.34453781512605
8147963,5,B000IZJZBW,"While not intended for people below the mysticla barrier of 18 who somehow can't grasp the notion that making jokes about biological functions is just funny and nothign else, Dr. Tran delivers some great animated fun.  While their first two installments (the Beyond Grandpa series) are a little crude, Everything else is pure inspiration.  It's mindless humor, make no mistake.  But it's mindless humor at its best.",1179619200,,415,5.164179104477612
