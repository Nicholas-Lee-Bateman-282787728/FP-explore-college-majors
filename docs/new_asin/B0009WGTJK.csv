8068169,5,B0009WGTJK,"Many people will tell you that some of the clips are easy to find on the net,but of course,you won't listen to them. You  won't find here the burning 500 francs,the WHITNEY HOUSTON affair or the insult to CATERINE RINGER which are the one you should download for fun. Here we have the music with some interviews. The early clips are laughable by today's standards,but i enjoyed watching SERGE singing his songs. Things gets more serious when SERGE makes an appearance at the BARDOT show,then there is clearly a mise en scene. We also have the complete HISTOIRE DE MELODY NELSON,preceeded by an interview which explains the story. This segment was inedit to this day ,and is of great interest to fans. Among other highlights are the interview with DENISE GLASER in which GAINSBOURG tells her he has turn back his overcoat when he found out he could feed the y?-y? stars with his songs. There are also many duets with FRANCE GALL,JANE BIRKIN and a few others. The two dvds are presented in chronogical order with a booklet and a biography. You need this if you are a big fan. If not,the cds will do the trick. SERGE GAINSBOURG has left this world fifteen years ago,but his legacy lives on. No SERGE,music is not a minor art,thanks to you and a few others.",1146268800,5,1253,4.59375
