2882335,5,B000S6LTH4,I only remember Gavin Mcleod in Season 1. He wasn't in Season 2 and Season 3.,1189468800,,77,3.875
2882336,5,B000S6LTH4,"I picked up the first season of the series because I had never seen it but had enjoyed seeing the McHale's Navy movies time after time in syndication while growing up.  The series started a little slowly (I guess they all do, though, with the actors finding their characters...), but after the fourth episode I didn't see Tim Conway, Earnest Borgnine, or any of the actors anymore.  Instead I saw Ensign Parker, Quentin McHale, Gruber, Christy, Tinker, Vern, and all the rest of them.  The sweet art of farce is certainly missing from much of today's TV (except for perhaps Arrested Development and one or two other notable modern comedies) and it was nice to sit back and laugh at some good old fashioned schtick!

I panicked a little when I realized that, after zipping through four of the five discs, I had only one DVD of joy left before I ran out of episodes.  I hadn't realized that the 1st season set I'd picked up was the ONLY season released thus far!!!  For the last few months I've been doing random searches for ""McHale's Navy"" in hopes that news would break that the second season would be released soon.  What a relief that the next season will soon be out!

Shout Factory's transfers of these episodes are among the most clear and defined I have seen.  I have a CRT projector tv that creates a 96"" diagonal picture (fed by a VGA video cable from a HTPC) and as far as I could see, there was NO grain, no washed out areas, and quite a range of brightness in the images.  I'm sure Shout did some luminance and contrast correction on the digital files after the transfer.  What is really nice, however, is that they seem to have used a light touch and done just enough to sharpen the image without going overboard with filters or superfluous manipulations.

In short, I have loved every episode of every disc of the first season.  It has nearly killed me to ration my viewing of new episodes to one a week or one every two weeks in order to draw out the pleasure of the newness until the next season is released (I still have not viewed the last two episodes...but have nearly gone mad!).  Rest assured, however, I will be in line to be the first to get the Season Two set and every set that Shout Factory releases thereafter!",1185753600,15,2238,4.440097799511002
2882337,5,B000S6LTH4,"Climb aboard and set a course for laughter as Lt. Commander McHale and the crew of PT 73 return with 36 more light-hearted romp on the Pacific episodes in McHale's Navy - Season Two!

Still at odds with authority, skipper McHale (Ernest Borgnine), Ensign Parker (Tim Conway), and the fun-lovin' crew of PT 73 continue to oppose blustery Capt. Binghamton (Joe Flynn) and his jittery aide Lt. Carpenter (Bob Hastings) with hilarious results. Whether helping one friend get a letter out to his girl from a Japanese compound (""A Letter for Fuji"") or helping another to hear his child say her first words via ham radio using a confiscated enemy radio (""A Da-Da For Christy""), the teamwork and camaraderie McHale and his men display in the episodes remain among my favorite aspects of the show.

This company Shout Factory puts commercials at the beginning of the disc like most, but you cannot forward past them. Maybe one commercial would be ok, but there are several minutes of them. I buy movies and shows to get away from these. REALLY disappointed in this company. Once you get past the commercials, the video quality is ok, not great but ok.. But every time you start the disc, you have to watch the lame commercials again. As a kid, McHale's Navy was one of my favorites, and still is, just a shame what Shout has done to them for a little more profit.

2882426,3,B000S6LTH4,"McHale's Navy (1962-66) follows the WW II exploits of the crew of PT 73, stationed in the Pacific, on the island of Taratupa, who try to skirt military authority, and get by with doing as little as possible.  While the military comedy had been explored many times in film and on television, goldbricking and insubordination, in the middle of a war, had rarely been so blatant or cavalier.  Controversial or not, many found this approach quite amusing.  And since President John Kennedy had commanded a PT boat, a certain mystique had developed regarding the craft, which is certainly a very slick looking vessel.

Hogan's Heroes (1965-71) set in a German POW camp, was another WW II spoof.  Comparing these two series, there are basic and very significant differences.  In a unique way, Colonel Hogan and his men are fighting the Germans, making a significant contribution to winning the war.  In McHale's Navy, WW II often seems like an afterthought, something in the background, that only occasionally comes to the forefront.  For McHale and the crew of PT 73, fighting the enemy is a relatively rare occurrence.  Even making a positive contribution to the war effort, usually occurs only as a byproduct of one of their wacky schemes.  Discipline is so lax, that Commander McHale is often unaware of what mischief his men are up to, as they attempt to evade the watchful eye of Captain Binghamton.

While McHale's Navy may have a questionable point of view, it does have a great cast.  Ernest Borgnine an Oscar winner for Marty, made the interesting career choice to come to TV.  Quinton McHale may not be the most admirable guy, but he is likeable.  Ensign Parker was written as extremely goofy, and over the top, taking full advantage of Tim Conway's unique, in your face style of physical humor.  McHale's crew of ""pirates"", led by  seamen Gruber (Carl Ballantine), ""Tinker"" Bell (Billy Sands) and ""Happy Haines"" Haines (Gavin MacLeod), were steady supporting players.

Joe Flynn brought great energy and emotion, to his portrayal of Captain Binghamton, as his wonderfully crazy mannerisms, brought the character to life.  As the representative of military authority, Binghamton is the most essential character to making the show work.  ""Old Leadbottom"", backed by his clinging bootlicking aide Lt. Carpenter (Bob Hastings), is usually the only thing preventing total chaos from breaking out.  The whining Binghamton is not without his faults, and McHale and his men are quick to exploit them to their advantage.

McHale's Navy was about outrageously breaking the rules, and defying authority.  This near total lawlessness, appealed to the series' many fans.  Light and trivial, the show does generates laughs, and features some fine comedic performances, but the almost total detachment from WW II, tends to trivialize that conflict.  That Fuji (Yoshio Yoda), a Japanese soldier who deserted, is regarded as a de facto member of McHale's crew, symbolizes how much of a joke the war was.  McHale's Navy is certainly not meant to be taken seriously at any level, but the roots of its humor seems to be in questionable taste.  Would a comedy set in the current Iraq war, featuring a group of similar goofballs in the US Army, be regarded as tasteful or funny?

Shout Factory has done an excellent job with the DVD release, as the episodes look fabulous, without any major flaws.  Jam packed with 36 episodes, Season Two is a very good value, though unfortunately the episodes are not subtitled.  Short interviews with Ernie Borgnine and Tim Conway are the only bonus materials.",1277510400,2,3580,5.0

2882428,5,B000S6LTH4,"McHale and his crew are at it again in season 2. The first two episodes start off with a bang. Binghamton captures Mchale's Japanese POW/cook Fuji thinking he's a spy. McHale comes up with a plan to convince Binghamton the war is over in order to rescue Fuji. In the second one, McHale and his crew are overheard by Capt Binghamton plotting to kill a noisy bird that's been driving them nuts - only Binghamton thinks they are plotting to kill HIM. The antics of the PT-73 crew go on and on and so do the laughs. This has always been one of my favorite sitcoms and season 2 is great for the low price.",1245801600,,600,4.226086956521739

2882430,5,B000S6LTH4,"Great to see these in DVD format. I have carried these around with me on travels and nothing beats unwinding after a hard day, with a few laughs from LTCOMDR McHale and his crew of 'water rats'; as they get involved in more madcap escapades that involve raising the ire of Captain Binghamtom and his servile aid Lieutenant Carpenter.

This set also contains separate interviews with Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, as they recount their time with the McHale's Navy series.

There are some bloopers in this series; these are the ones I have noted and I am sure other readers may have noticed some too!

Episode 2:15 Orange Blossom for McHale-Captain Binghamton tries to get an old flame of McHale's to marry McHale in order to ship McHale back to the States, however, as usual the plan backfires on Binghamton. McHale escorts his old flame back to New Caledonia and in the closing scenes is noted with his wristwatch on, when he walks back to the boat his watch is gone and then it is back on his left wrist and when the scene returns, the watch is gone, in the next scene he looks for his watch.

Episode 2:17 A Medal for Parker-Ensign Parker pulls a grenade off his webbing and throws it out the window, when the scene returns there is another grenade in the exact same place on his webbing.

Episode 2:23 Dear Diary-Parker and Binghamton end up flying a Japanese Cargo plane, in one scene the plane is flying upside down with the ocean and land at the top of the picture.

Episode 2:29 The Return of Big Frenchy-The scene opens with a heavy fog over Taratupa...something that would not have occurred in the tropical South Pacific. In another scene Parker pulls out a revolver, when the standard issue side arm of the US Navy was a .45????

In this season, the door on Captain Binghamton's office changes; in some episodes the door handle is on the left (as the camera faces the door) with the door opening inwards and in other episodes the handle is on the right and the door opens outwards,

The show still evokes laughs some 48 years later.

2882432,5,B000S6LTH4,"In the second season, the producers of this show figured out where success for the show was to be found--and it shows in the opening credits: Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn) and Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) are featured right after McHale.  Even though McHale is supposedly the star character, it's really Parker who carries this show.  Binghamton is only slightly less important.  The interplay between these two makes for a very funny show. I've almost busted a gut several times watching these two idiots!  The others of McHale's group are now assigned a pecking order, with Gruber, who probaby could have carried the show by himself, becoming the lead navy-man. Happy (Gavin MacLeod) is mercifully relegated to low man on the totem pole (doesn't he leave the show in a year or two?). This is good, clean family fun and it's a riot.  Get it and enjoy.

2882436,3,B000S6LTH4,"It's great to see McHale and his band of merry men again.  Shout! Factory, however, really did a poor job on the transfers.  The sound is horrendously bad and out of synch with the characters' lips most of the time.  Almost like they created the DVD video using second-rate software.  The picture quality is good, with a few errors here and there over the discs that shows up as pixelated blockiness.  The best picture in the world can't make up for the botched audio, though, and it's very hard to concentrate on the show itself when the audio is so badly out of synch.  Throw in the incessant commercials at the beginning of the discs that you can't skip or fast-forward over and you've got your below-average DVD set that is not a complete joy to own, which it should be.  If you really love McHale's Navy then it's something you probably want to have.  It's a shame I feel as though I had to settle for this Shout! Factory hack job.",1195516800,2,936,4.401162790697675
2882437,4,B000S6LTH4,"After viewing season one, I was chomping at the bit to get this one. It wasn't quite as good as season 1 but it's still some funny stuff. Tim Conway found his niche with the role of Ensign Parker; Ernest Borgnine proved his versatility as an actor (doing a comedic role): Joe Flynn basically reprised his role from a previous TV series.
I'm not sure, but it seems the transfer quality wasn't quite as good on season 2 as the previous set, but it's still very good. There are two bonus features: an short interview with Borgnine & another short one with Conway. Neither are in depth nor very enlightening to their roles in the series.",1195430400,3,633,4.4655172413793105

And the laughs are a plenty with Ernest Borgnine as Quentin McHale,Joe Flynn as 'old leadbottom',Capt. Binghamton and Tim Conway playing Ensign Parker. Bob Hastings also played an underrated role as Lt. Carpenter. I always felt sorry for him as Binghamtons' number two. There never was a more underappreciated bootlicker than he.
So well were the characters played by Joe Flynn and Tim Conway received by the public that they were now a part of the opening credits. The credits would expand even more in future seasons. Axel Stordahl tweaked the music ever so slightly and gave it a bit more umphh. The scripts continued to get better and were played to the hilt by all. Much slapstick and related humour abound in these episodes,much of it going to Tim Conway and his Stan Laurel-like character. It usually was either centered around Conway or inadvertantly directed from Conway towards Binghamton. Anyway it went it was always hilarious to watch.
Technically this set has its' share of problems though. The first ep here starts off with terrible sound. The music is like listening to something coming out a long hollow tube. Furthermore other eps just past this are slighly out of sync with the film and their voices. I don't know why this couldn't be corrected. Strangley enough there is a short clip of an ep shown in the Tim Conway interview and if you look closely the voice is way out of sync. But if you actually watch the ep it was taken from everything is fine(?).Also there are eps with some contrast problems. During the final Universal credits at the end of one ep particularly the credits cut out about half way through and go back to the main menu abruptly. This is a technical flaw made by the DVD makers not artifacts(as previously described) from the shows themselves. As you progress through the season(pretty much well into disc two)things do settle down but there are exceptions here and there. Take the first ep on Disc five. Near the beginning while Gruber talks to the crew a slight pixelation briefly occurs. The last two flaws mentioned are not artifacts from the films but just plain sloppy work on Shouts' part. It's the worst of the two seasons in so far as technical flaws go.
As I briefly mentioned there is a Tim Conway interview but also an Ernest Borgnine interview. Both are relatively short but it is nice to see these gents reminiscing. Although with Tim Conway anything near a serious interview is nearly impossible!
In conclusion there are some technical flaws in this set,some of which are inherent in the film themselves but others made through deficiencies in The Shout Factorys'work,so just beware as you watch them;which of course limited my rating. However Season two is even funnier and better than the first. Mchale is still scheming and Binghamton is still exhorting:""I could just scream!"".It's good fun and good humour,for the entire family.",1194307200,15,3015,4.8

8204471,5,B000S6LTH4,"It cracks me up when people compare McHale's Navy to the regular Navy.  Yeah, I was in the Navy too and it wasn't McHale's.  But I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!  This is TV.  This is comedy.  THIS is funny stuff.

Ernest Borgnine plays LCDR Quinten McHale, USN.  Since Borgnine actually DID spend 9 years in the Navy, he's got a grip on the lingo and feel for being a sailor.  Tim Conway, well, that man's just a one man comedy team.  His slapstick comedy and buffoonery pokes fun at all the 90 Wonder Ensigns in Uncle Sam's Canoe Club.  Throw in Gavin McLeod (who would later take the helm on the Love Boat) and a few other greats and you've got a television program that's guaranteed to make you laugh and poke fun at itself in the process.

If you want to know what the ""real"" Navy's like, there's plenty of documentaries out there to get you through.  If you want to watch some great comedy with Conway getting chops just right and learning from the late, great Ernest Borgnine.",1470960000,,973,4.374301675977653
