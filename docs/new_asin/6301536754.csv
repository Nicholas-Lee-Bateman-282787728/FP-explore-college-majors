Garner, Rod Taylor and Eva Marie Saint. A great World War II movie. It was just

7812942,1,6301536754,"What -- I can't give this half a star or no stars?  I saw this movie several years ago and loved it, and I've looked for it for a long time.  I was glad to find it available, and was looking forward to watching it again, but but couldn't watch it.  The tape was either poor quality or worn out, or both.  It kept pulling away from the heads, causing the picture to black out every few seconds.  I put the tape in a fairly new case, and that didn't help much.  Needless to say, I was not a happy camper.  I ordered another copy from another seller, and was fairly happy with that one.",1265328000,,583,4.017391304347826
