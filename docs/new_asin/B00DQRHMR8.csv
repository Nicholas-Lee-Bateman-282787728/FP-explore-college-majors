8596393,5,B00DQRHMR8,"I really like the Dead from this period with Brent Mydland. Most of the shows I went to is from this time. This show has a awesome set list. From the opening song Let the Good Times Roll you can feel this is going to be a fun one. With Jerry glancing over to Brent with a smirk as they start to feel the flow. It is something I miss but was lucky to go to many shows when Jerry was still here... I miss his friendly smile. Brent was the Perfect Fit and wish they were still here with us to show the younger generation what it was all about. If you are a younger fan and didn't get a chance to see Jerry and you want to know what it was like, just pop this in your DVD player with good surround sound and turn it up as high as you can so you can hear Phil Lesh bass rattle the walls when he hits them notes.",1460073600,4,806,3.775147928994083
