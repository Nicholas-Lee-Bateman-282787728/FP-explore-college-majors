272751,5,6300250512,"I have seen this film about 10 times. The first time was right after reading the book when it first came out. The film does great justice to the book. There are actually only about 2 differences from the book and they  are useful in their symbolism. First, the hair color of her fiance and new  love interest are reversed in the movie. The symbolism in the book is that  her new love is darker and more brooding, while the fiance is the fair  haired boy. Second, when Lucy first kisses George in the field, in the  movie it looks like a field of grass or wheat. The book has this as a field  of violets, which of course, is symbolic of their passion. I know I sound  like a complete snob, but this film and the underlying book were so  fabulous, I remember these bits of information from the book as if I had  read it yesterday, when, indeed, I read it 15 years ago. This is enduringly  romantic and beautiful.",942105600,8,910,4.238372093023256

This is actually a hilarious scene, and not at all ""rated x"", so I just don't get it. I was so disappointed! I thought I'd missed it when I went to make popcorn and came back and no one said anything...so I said, did I miss the best part?  Has anyone else noticed this?

272887,2,6300250512,"I first saw this 30 years ago and watched it twice. At the time, I thought I was supposed to like it because, to like it was to be sophisticated, artsy, and intellectual. Above all, there was opera in it and who was I to question high-brow culture? Thus, I went along with the crowd and praised it with my peers and the critics.

Viewing it 30 years later, I still think it's a handsome production with a beautiful main actress, Helena Bonham Carter. The costumes are nice as well as the cinematography and set design. However, I don't think it's a good movie.

The main problem is that the story seems to lurch like an old car, never finding its rhythm. At certain times, the scenes were cut too short, interrupted by a chapter heading. One prominent example was when George Emerson and Lucy Honeychurch converse over the river after they've just witnessed a horrific murder. George confides that they're both forever changed by this incident. What should have followed was a reaction closeup of Lucy, an expression on her face that showed her inner emotion and turmoil as she absorbed George's words. What we got was...a cut to the next chapter heading. With a gifted actress like Helena Bonham Carter, it was a wasted opportunity.

What's more, I never felt I got to know any of the characters deeply. George Emerson was an enigma like the question mark he left in his room. Daniel Day-Lewis, who played Cecil, was a thoroughly unlikable prig. What did Lucy ever see in him to accept his marriage proposal? It's so unbelievable. Clearly, Cecil was not Mr. Right, but was George? Possibly. Or, possibly, what Lucy needed was more time to explore and mature and get to know herself.

George and his father were very close, but absent was a heartfelt conversation between the two of them. Lucy and her brother, Freddy, were also very close, but there were no deep words between them either. Such scenes might've helped.

272999,2,6300250512,"Plodding, boring, non sequitur at many times, and few performances that really feel developed or polished.  Daniel Day Lewis and Denholm Elliot are given the chance to be characters and do their typically good work, the rest feels like a passing, flashing who's who of British Cinema: lots of interesting people we ultimately don't get to know.  Helena Bonham Carter is the major player and she couldn't carry this movie with three Sherpa helpers. It's clear the scenery and costumes are supposed to be the stars in most shots.

FYI, there's a scene about halfway through the movie where there's about 2 minutes of sustained male full-frontal nudity.  For some this could be quite weird.  It's not sexual, it's three grown men running around a lake, splashing and playing British tag in the total buff.  After about one minute of this scene I just started laughing because it just goes on and on and on.  I guess it was a simpler time.

Overall the pacing is weird, we linger in places where there's nothing happening but pretty countryside, we cut short interactions between characters.  Too bad, had potential.",1475798400,,1112,4.872340425531915

273002,2,6300250512,"Meh.  A rather lame and unrealistic story about two people that have barely spent an hour together (almost always chaperoned) who suddenly think they are in love with each other even though they are strangers to one another.  The movie also continues the tired and possibly alarming cliche that women like to be grabbed and kissed by near strangers even if there is an attraction.

I found it hard to get interested in any of the characters given that none of them seem to work and have way too much time on their hands.  I ended up looking more at the costumes, interior design and scenery than paying attention to the rather simple but disjointed storyline.

There is also a rather odd, overly long skinny dipping scene of three men.  Kinda funny but didn't add at all to the storyline.  I think the director just wanted to see naked guys.

273087,4,6300250512,"No question for Europe and to the extent that Britain was part of Europe (and is, note the Brexit vote recently) World War I was a watershed between the old ideas of civil society and the new the old represented in Britain by the cultural term Victorian era, reflecting certain strait is the gate social norms and tons of sexual repression at least in public. And at least in the public prints, and in public entertainments as well. But right at the end of the era, right around the turn of the century, the turn of the 20th century little cracks began to appear and the younger generation, the younger generation whose male component would join the rest of the flower of European manhood which would lay its head down in some foreboding fields of France, led the way. Not too much however should be made, or rather over-made, of those cracks witness the fate of poor Oscar Wilde who despite his sardonic and witty jabs at late Victorian (and we will not forget when the old biddy Victoria died the changeover to Edwardian era) wound up in Reading Gaol for acts one could not speak of, for the love that dare not speak its name. Those small cracks though are what E.M. Forster looked at in his 1908 novel A Room With A View of which the 1985 film adaptation by the famous team of Ivory and Merchant being reviewed here is based on.

Of course the room with the view idea is both a concrete expression of a physical location in arty Florence where the main characters mix and match in a modest boarding house, a place where a coterie of British citizens are taking a middle class version of the old Grand Tour and attempting to get a room with a view of the famous and quite beautiful city and a more idealistic concept of freedom, of breaking away from the past of stuffy convention and routine. That tension between tradition, custom, the old ways and the jail break-out of that late Victorian generation, or part of it drives the film (and the book as well since Ivory-Merchant at least in regard to Forsters work are pretty faithful to the authors storyline).
Here is how the small jail-break played out in this one. Lucy, Lucy of the review headline, played rather nicely by a young and precocious Helen Bonham Carter along with her strait is the gate sexually repressed older cousin Charlotte as chaperone, played, inevitably played, by the great character actor Maggie Smith, are among the guests at that boarding house in Florence mentioned earlier. They, despite their fervent request, have been given a room without a view, and seemed destined to have to put up with that condition until two male fellow boarders, the Emersons, father and son, switch rooms with them. Not only switch rooms with them but are the antithesis of gentile society with some pretty advanced free-thinking ideas that old Emerson has passed on to his son, George. His beautiful son George, played by Julian Sloan, which set up the tormented love interest that drives the film as Lucy struggles with her allegiances to the past and her desire to be a thoroughly modern Millie. Needless to say in Florence no good can come of the budding romance, and nothing does except that George makes his first rebuffed attempt at smitten-hood (translation: He tried to kiss Lucy in an elysian field).

Fast forward, well, maybe not fast forward but forward with Lucy back in England (you know Britain without Scotland, Ireland, and Wales in those days) at her familys country estate where she had after several earlier refusals decided that she would marry an ardent suitor, the bookish snobbish Cecil (played by a young Daniel Day-Lewis). Well if that is what she wants then okay. But Cecil is strictly a bookworm, an intellectual looking to add Lucy to his collection of books or something,  strictly a character in old-fashioned Victorian tradition (hell he doesnt even play tennis then the rage among the younger set). The beautiful part though is when George, who along with his father has very conveniently taken a small mansion in the neighborhood, puts serious doubts in Lucys mind about her future with a bookworm, with a guy who won't even look up at the sky but keeps his nose in a book quoting odd-ball writers out of hand.

Eventually she gives Cecil his well-deserved walking papers but even after that freedom break something is amiss, something is still stirring in her suppressed passionate heart. Against all odd though and this is the ending every ladies reading circle would be looking for is this kind of novel and in a film plotline after speaking with old Emerson it turned out that she loved, madly loved, George. Of course George and Lucy had to sneak off to Florence to elope since breaking off ones engagement to a well-established figure and taking up with a free-spirit would not do, would just not do in high society. What do you want to bet though they have a room with a view in that boarding house they were staying at in Florence? A room with a view if they ever get up from the downy billows.",1466899200,,4998,4.656851642129105

Many young actors in this movie who went on to make many more. Daniel Day-Lewis, who plays a supercilious fop, is at the early stage of his career where he was virtually unrecognizable every time I saw him.  But I remember checking the credits to see who he was.

It is a period piece that does not seem dated. I watched it the first time about 30 years ago and it still feels current. The quality of the acting, directing, and filming here is amazing. There is a reason, that it won the academy award for best film that year. It was done so well, that unless we have moved on to 3D hologram style viewing, there will never be a need to remake this.
I gave a much more detailed review of the characters for the book version review...
 The gist of the story, is that a young lady from the English countryside, is making her 1st trip away from home. She visits Italy with her aunt in tow as her chaperon. She meets several other English travelers. All of them are interesting characters. After seeing a bit of the world, can she go back and settle for the quiet life that is expected of her? The movie/book debates fate vs coincidence due to common interests. It is honest, innocent, and hopeful. The leading lady is independent. The leading man is everything a lady needs to swoon.
If you have never seen it before, it is a must watch. If you have seen it, you know it is a must own.

273393,5,6300250512,"In romance movies, there is always some obstacle that needs to be overcome before the lovers can come together for good. But what if the obstacle is one of the lovers?

Such is the problem in ""A Room With A View,"" a classic Merchant-Ivory film adapted from E.M. Forster's lightest and sweetest novel. And while it follows the will-they-won't-they formula of most romcoms, there's a poignancy and enchanted quality to the movie that results -- director James Ivory fills it with exquisitely lush countryside, a natural unfolding of romantic and personal problems, and a magnificent cast playing characters who end up being quite likable.

After a childhood spent in a small, idyllic Surrey village, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) journeys to Italy with her middle-aged cousin/chaperone Charlotte (Maggie Smith). Charlotte is dismayed when their rooms at the pensione don't have a view, which inspires the outgoing but clueless Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliott) to volunteer the more ""viewy"" rooms of himself and his awkward, quiet son George (Julian Sands).

During the stay, Lucy becomes better acquainted with George, the pleasant Reverend Beebe (Simon Callow), some nice old ladies, and a cheesy romance novelist (Judi Dench). Then George impulsively and passionately kisses Lucy in a field of flowers, but Charlotte convinces Lucy that he's just a rake seeking an easy conquest.

Upon their return to Surrey, Lucy becomes engaged to a pompous and wealthy young man, Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis), and seems destined for a completely conventional life. But then she learns that Cecil has arranged for a local country villa to be rented by the Emersons -- and George's friendship with her brother causes him to enter her orbit. Soon Lucy finds that not only are George's feelings for her very real, but she may not be able to hide what she feels for him as well.

Out of all of Forster's stories, ""A Room With A View"" is perhaps the lightest and most enchanting -- there aren't any sudden deaths, contrived obstacles, social upheavals or then-taboo subjects. It's just a sweet love story, where the lovers' biggest problem is that one of them is reluctant to admit that she loves the other. There are a few convenient coincidences (which George chalks up to ""fate""), but for the most part, it's all about two people's awkward, rocky road to finding true love.

And Ivory makes every scene like a glorious painting come to life -- the lush Italian countryside and sunlit cities, the quaint English villages, the forests full of murky ponds and waving ferns. The story unfolds at a gradual, pleasant pace, punctuated by pretty tableaus of tennis, carriage rides and meanders through the woods, and dialogue that ranges from amusing (""Why shouldn't she be transfigured? It happened to the Goths!"") to beautiful in its simplicity (""He doesn't love you. But I love you. I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings, even when I hold you in my arms!"").

Occasionally Ivory's artistic taste gets a bit self-indulgent (a very long, mildly homoerotic nude frolic/wrestling match by Beebe, Frederick and George in the woods), but he knows when to insert gentle humor and a tinge of bittersweetness (Charlotte's unspoken lament over her own lost chances at love).

And one of the most striking things about the story is how likable everyone is. All the characters have flaws (Cecil is a snob, Charlotte is an uptight Victorian, Lucy is excessively stubborn, Mr. Emerson is loud and clueless, George is socially awkward) but they ultimately all prove to be good, kind people when their flaws and mistakes are revealed to them. There is no villain or even an antagonist -- though Cecil seems like he will be the major obstacle to George and Lucy's happiness, the sudden breaking of their engagement shows that he isn't that bad a guy, and that he did care for her.

It also helps to have a magnificent cast, including Bonham-Carter, Sands, Smith, Eliott, Dench and Day-Lewis. Bonham-Carter gives a sublime performance in particular, and though Ivory often reminds us that Lucy is unconsciously lying to herself and everyone else, she nails it in a final emotional outpouring in front of Mr. Emerson. Sands is outstanding as a passionate, beauty-loving young man who doesn't really know how to properly woo a young lady, as the counterpoint to the repressed, over-cautious Smith, who has to rediscover what young love can be. And while Day-Lewis seems to be playing a caricature at first, he does imbue the character with depth and a measure of likability.

The excellent actors and glorious direction make ""A Room With A View"" a glorious experience -- a warm'n'fuzzy period romance with characters that are easy to like. Bright, bittersweet and a treat for the senses.",1423958400,,4776,5.003778337531486

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Producer Ismail Merchant and Director James Ivory, better known collectively as Merchant Ivory, are known for their lavish costume dramas. While they had been making films since the 1960's, the first film to gain them any kind of major notoriety was their adaptation of E.M. Forster's A Room With A View. Starring a then the unknown Helena Bonham Carter at the head of a cast of notable British character actors, the film was a major hit the world over, winning several Academy Awards in both England and America and being nominated for many more. Now, 22 years later, the film has been released on this exquisite Blu-ray disc.

E.M. Forster's novel was written at the turn of the 20th Century, when English society was just learning how to come out from the ironclad grip of Victorian attitude. At the time, the novel was a harsh critique of a country that was trying desperately to hold on to standards of etiquette and decorum that Forster saw as increasingly restrictive. This novel was seen as a rebellious cry for youth. Looking at it now, where people are encouraged to say what they feel and do as they please, it feels antiquated. Of course Lucy should run off with George, a modern audience member is more than likely to think. Why wouldn't she?

The film does an excellent job of setting up the pressures placed upon a British lady of the period. In particular, Dame Maggie Smith is brilliant as the old-fashioned and repressed Charlotte. With just a few words, she conveys all that is wrong with English social conventions. Daniel Day-Lewis is also a standout with his take on Cecil. As a member of the old guard, he certainly is an ill fit for Lucy, but he's not so far gone that he can't perhaps find his own way in the grand scheme of things.

This was an early film for Helena Bonham Carter, and indeed the one that set the course of her career for many years to come. That being said, she's not especially good. She's flat and often seems to be reacting instead of acting. More than that, though, she plays Lucy as someone who for the most part accepts the very aspects of English life that she's meant to be running away from. I know it's a story about repression, but she seems to enjoy it as much as she resists it. Julian Sands is just a sheer joy to watch, as he is in practically every film he's in.

As I mentioned before, Merchant Ivory are best known for their detailed depictions of times now past. `A Room With A View' is no exception. The sweeping views of Florence, Italy are so beautifully rendered, and the costumes are totally perfect, probably down to the stitching. The fateful pond in which Lucy's brother Freddie bathes is picturesque and lush. On the other hand, James Ivory's actual filmmaking technique feels a little too precious for my taste. In particular, the score overlaid on top of the film often feels far too beatific for the events actually occurring on screen. Often we'll have a perfectly good dialogue scene ruined by the incessant whining of the strings, which appear so often as to lose all impact. Even with Ivory's penchant for affectation, there's still a solid little film in `A Room With A View.' I don't necessarily think it's quite as great many feel it is, but there's no denying that the production values and acting are first rate and is worth viewing on a regular basis.

Blu-ray Video Quality - `A Room With A View' was a low budget 1985 British film 1985. The encoded 1080p transfer is fine for its age. Colours are pastel and add to the period of the time, but despite this, I really enjoyed this Blu-ray disc and is now definitely in need of a re-mastered Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality - The BBC has generously given us a 5.1 DTS-HD mix for this release, but it doesn't amount to much. Aside from the score and a few environmental effects [rainfall etc], the surrounds are almost never used. This is about as stereo of a mix as you can get. Also, it's showing its age. Dialogue is slightly harsh, so that is why it is about time they re-mastered this classic film, despite this, I really like viewing this Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

All of the special features are in 480p. Almost all of them are period clips from BBC television, and as such are of rather low picture quality.

Commentary with Producer Ismail Merchant, Director James Ivory, Director of Photography Tony Pierce-Roberts and Actor Simon Callow: This low-key commentary is almost as held back as the characters in the film. Merchant Ivory dominates the proceedings with light reminiscences. Callow jumps in every so often and Pierce-Roberts is hardly heard at all. Much of the commentary is devoted to listening to the men simply watch the movie. This not very engaging at all.

Interviews with Actors Simon Callow and Daniel Day Lewis: These are interviews from when the film was shot. They're from a BBC TV morning show called ""Breakfast Time."" They're both very brief and insubstantial. Of the two, Daniel Day-Lewis has the better one, but neither is anything revelatory.

Breakfast Time Report on UK Films In The USA: Another snippet, this time on the success of `A Room With A View' in America. There are some hilarious interviews here with New Yorkers coming out of the theatre, having just seen the movie.

Film '96 Profile on Merchant Ivory: A short retrospective on the Merchant Ivory history. Included are achingly brief interviews with Greta Scacchi, Hugh Grant, and Helena Bonham Carter.

E.M. Forster Remembered: A half-hour tribute to the author shortly after his death. Included are remembrances by friends, commentary by critics, and more.

Film Scrapbook: A photo gallery, with the film's insufferable music playing over the top.

Finally, `A Room With A View' is one of the most highly regarded period piece of the time. And with the film's attention to detail and stellar cast, it's easy to see why it was a massive world-wide hit. While I do think James Ivory's filmmaking can be a little too much of a good thing, this is a film that is worth seeing time after time and I am so honoured to add this beautiful Merchant Ivory Blu-ray disc to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

On the other hand I loved the scenes from Florence as well as the England country side.
When I saw that Amazon was selling a Blu Ray of the movie I decided to buy it and after watching it again I got the same impression as the one I had 20 years ago.

273547,5,6300250512,"If I made a list of my 50 all time favorite movies, Room with a View would most certainly could be found in the top half of that list.  But of course if I made the same sort of list of books, the book by E.M. Forster first published in 1908 from which this movie is based, would hold about the same position so I suppose it is natural.  I have watched this particular movie at least six times now.

Let me state right here though that I did not use the available DVD.  I have this movie on VHS (Yes, some of us still use these things) and have seen it on various movie channels.  I understand there is a problem with some of the DVD though so I suppose you need to read the reviews here carefully if you plan to purchase.

Be that as it may.....

This movie is one of those odd creatures that was based on a book and lucky for us the movie makers did not muck it all up as they normally do.  They can usually take a wonderful book and completely destroy it in two hours.  Not so in this case.  I can truthfully say that I enjoyed watching this presentation just about as much as reading the book...and that is a lot.

The story takes place at the turn of the 20th century.  The first part is shot it Italy and the second in England.  Both are breathtaking and interesting...the contrast in the country side is wonderful.

The story is of young love, of coming of age and we have the much used love triangle so loved by authors of the age.  Along with the love story though we get a wonderful peek at the English upper class manners and mores of that day and age - a fascinating study.  I feel it was very accurate in this as I was raised (due to my advanced age) around people who lived through this period of history and I could see many friends and relatives in this story.

I could not find one thing to complain about as to the acting ability or the performances of one of the actors in this film.  It was nominated for and received quite a number of awards and it does not take much to figure out why.

Now the story is most certainly series but is filled with humor throughout.  I found myself with a smile on my face through most of the viewing; at the same time though there is an underlying pathos which plays well off of the more light hearted moments.

This is one of those movies that I really recommend watching more than one time.  With each viewing the viewer will pick up more and more.  It is the same with the book.  And speaking of the book....

Right now, as I write this review, Amazon has a very nice copy on Kindle for free.  You can also pick up a very nice used copy of the soft or hardback for very little.  I highly recommend the reading of this work.  If you read it as a youngster in some half forgotten literature class and hated it at the time, I strongly recommend you read it again..it is a wonderful work.

This movie is about the struggle of a young maiden between the societys doctrines and her hearts desire. The subtlety back in those days is faithfully portrayed by all actors, and should be taken into consideration when viewing this movie.  The story, cinematography, the casts are top notch. Indeed there is a very brief scene showing male frontal nudity. However, in my humble opinion, is far from sexual or sensual. In fact, it is quite innocent and natural.

If you persevere you may become distracted by your questions, which, will never be answered. Against my will I found Helena Bonham Carter's character dislikable, I was appalled at the great waste of Maggie Smith's talent, and I found Julian Sands' character slightly disturbing (like there was something not quite right in the head about him)the story stands so far back from the characters that it's impossible to really care about them and the cinematography, while executed well, is presented in a washed out, drab format...which sucks out all of the intended ambiance of the setting. what a colossal waste of time I spent viewing this muddled mess.

Other movie companies need to take note.  This isn't self-conscious like some movies which aspire to be known as great.  This is a film that flows.  Most adaptations fall short, but this does not.  Unlike the recent BBC production of A Room with a View, this one remains true to the text and captures the mood.  The personalities are spot on.  The actors channel the characters of the book and it is all so effortless that you forget how hard making such a production has to be.  Merchant Ivory will forever be known to me as the only ones who could translate books to film in such a true manner.  They have handled Forster's works with incredible class.  Don't even bother with the newer BBC production as it takes far too much license with the story.  This piece is beautiful in every sense.

Generally I try to get over this by forgetting the book as far as possible and simply concentrating on whether a movie works or not as a stand-alone entity.

However, although it doesn't often happen, there are occasions when the film version is more enjoyable than the book. This, for me, is one such occasion. This movie is vibrant and fun from start to finish, uplifting and beautiful to watch and graced by an amazing cast. In fact, it's a who's who of British actors of the period, from Fabia Drake and Denholm Elliott towards the end of their careers to Helena Bonham-Carter and Rupert Graves at the start of theirs, with Academy Award winners Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Daniel Day-Lewis backed by stalwarts Julian Sands, Rosemary Leach and Patrick Godfrey. A special mention goes to Simon Callow, whose smoking, skinny-dipping, broad-minded Reverend Beebe is far from the stuffy cleric of the novel.

The film looks stunning, the music is exquisite (using Puccini's (thank you, cate c.) O Mio Bobbino Caro from the opera Gianni Schicchi was a stroke of genius, both aurally and in the reference to Denholm Elliott's character who finally brings the two young lovers together) and the locations in Florence and rural England are wonderful.

Everything came together to make this a magnificent movie. It's one of the very few occasions when the book just doesn't match up.",1328745600,,1744,4.945392491467577

2/07: A Room with a View is a rare achievement in film making, that is, trying to transform a movie into a picture with a feel of a 19th century novel with brilliant performances. Deft and adroit direction is done by James Ivory. It's easily one of the finest pictures I have ever seen with absolutely magnificent cinematography. Maggie Smith and Daniel Day-Lewis were just perfect. Everybody else including Simon Callow, Denholm Elliot, Helena Bonham Carter, Rupert Graves, and Julian Sands were as good as well. A film having the right cast, the right director, the right artist staff, and the right feel, it is difficult achieve the balance. That's why a film like Dangerous Liaisons didn't work because of the miscasting of Keanu Reeves, Uma Thurman, and possibly John Malkovich (I still remain unsure about that) or a film like Malcolm X didn't work because of the wrong director or a film like Star Wars didn't work because of the inept acting. I can go on and on with films that didn't work and convince you why A Room with a View is a rare achievement. All in all, A Room with a View is the film not to miss.

10/10: Dropping the rating from `10' to `5', I found A Room with a View to be long and boring with a lot of pretended acting. Although I read those type of novels from 18th to 19th century and do understand the deportment and etiquette of the times, I found the duplication in the behaviors of the cast to be quite fake and awkward. Also, it's difficult for me to adjust my 21st century thinking for the film because the themes are pretty antiquated and frivolous. Of all characters, I hated Helena Bonahm Carter's the most, and I found her undeserving and quite stupid in a sanctimonious way. Maggie Smith is another worst of the film; that was just a bad example of overacting which is also falls in Judi Dench's department. Daniel Day-Lewis' work wasn't too bad actually. If anything, the cinematography of A Room with a View is the best feature and is enjoyed the most. All in all, A Room with a View is a disappointment for me.",1287705600,2,2079,4.5119363395225465
273815,5,6300250512,"In this romantic tale, young Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) takes a trip to Italy with her fretting, old-maidish cousin Charlotte (Maggie Smith). Among the interesting people Lucy meets is a middle class father (Denholm Elliott) and his introspective moody son George (Julian Sands). A picnic in the country, the heat of the day, and a kiss between Lucy and George changes Lucy forever. This is a witty and beautifully imagined filming of the E. M. Forester novel.",1285718400,,473,5.1558441558441555
273816,4,6300250512,"I say slightly because, as a whole, I liked this movie.  The four stars should give that away.  I'm giving it a B, verging on a B+.  It has many elements that work, but when compared to the work for which I have vowed forever adoration of James Ivory (`The Remains of the Day' and `Howard's End') this film just didn't have everything I wanted.  In the end I am blindsided by two ravishing performances (Bonham-Carter and Day-Lewis) and am delighted by a slew of nicely placed directorial touches (Ivory has such a tailored hand) but overall I find the film a tad lacking.

Ah, such is life.

The film revolves around the young Lucy Honeychurch who falls in love with a young man named George Emerson while on holiday with her cousin Charlotte in Italy.  Charlotte is apposed to the match and rushes Lucy home before further steps can be taken.  We then jump to Lucy, now engaged to the snobbish Cecil Vyse.  When a house nearby needs renting out, who better to show up than George and his father.  Things begin to get complicated when George becomes a family friend and Lucy's own mother and brother begin to express their dislike towards Cecil.  Charlotte makes another appearance and further complicates matters for Lucy, who is struggling to find balance and attain her own happiness while abiding by her social obligations.

For me, there were elements here that just didn't work.  At times the film felt stuffy and almost campy.  I thought that the plaque cards used to `tell us what is going on' were distracting.

I also found some of the performances to be a tad off kilter.  I love Maggie Smith, but I don't understand her Oscar nomination.  Judi Dench has less screen time and yet manages to do MUCH more.  Smith is just manic and clichd here.  Julian Sands annoyed me.  He was trying far too hard to be the `pretty boy' that he came across as distastefully effeminate.  That said, Dench, Bonham-Carter and Day-Lewis were all quite astonishing.  I love the way that Dench uses her wit to create a character larger than her screen time calls for.  She did this here as well as in `Shakespeare in Love' and even recently in `Nine'.  Bonham-Carter carries this film on her shoulders, and she does so with a grace and beautifully believable confliction.  Day-Lewis makes the biggest transformation (it took me forever to realize that was him).  He really gets every one of Cecil's idiosyncrasies just right, being careful to create a man and not a caricature.

The films plot and story are nicely achieved if not a tad generic for this type of film (which is why I loved `The Remains of the Day' so much, being totally original while never taking away from the genre at all).  Like I said, I like this movie, but it was not the slam-dunk I was expecting.",1274054400,2,2761,4.591002044989775

273852,5,6300250512,"I've owned this film on VHS for 20 years, and know it like the back of my hand. So I couldn't help but notice that, on the DVD version, the soundtrack was of a slightly higher pitch than what I'm used to--probably because the DVD plays the film at a slightly higher speed.  This is quite noticeable the very start of the film, as the aria plays over the opening credits (compare this to how it's played over the DVD menu, where it's played correctly). This flaw is also noticeable in the voices of the women, particularly Maggie Smith's and Helena Bonham Carter's: Smith sounds slightly ""chipmunk-y"", and Bonham Carter's slightly deep, alluring voice is now somewhat reedy. There's also a slight ""clip"" in her delivery. I've read other reviews, and some have mentioned that the running time is about 3-5 minutes faster than what is usually listed.

The film itself however, is still as beautiful as I remember, and it's good to see Carter, Day-Lewis, and Sands in the roles that introduced me to them. I have yet to see the PBS remake, but I can't help but wonder as to the point of it--it's not as if this version was ""horribly dated"".",1254182400,7,1136,4.563725490196078

273854,5,6300250512,"Keeping fairly in sync with E.M. Forster's novel of the same name, this 1985 Merchant-Ivory film follows its young English heroine, Lucy Honeychurch(Helena  Bonham Carter) through a tour of Italy with her grave, spinster aunt Charlotte (Maggie Smith), and back home again, where the young, upper-crust Englishwoman must decide between a proposal to the stuffy, traditional, and passionless Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day Lewis), and the livelier George Emerson (a winning Julian Sands).
  She and her aunt meet the latter suitor and his father, Mr. Emerson (the notoriously scene-stealing Denholm Elliott) over an incident in which the Emersons offer to change rooms in the hotel in Florence, which is run by a Cockney Signora (Amanda Walker) so that the women can have a room with a view.
  Among the English tourists and residents they encounter are novelist Eleanor Lavish (Judi Dench), the prim but comical Misses Catherine and Teresa Alan (Fabia Drake and Joan Henley), the Reverend Mr. Arthur Beebe( Simon Callow), and the Reverend Mr. Eager (Patrick Godfrey).
  We follow them through incidents ranging from the serene to the precarious. Miss Lavish gains inspiration for a novel (some of which is verbally handed to her by Charlotte), young Lucy witnesses a murder in the square and is assisted by George, subsequently making an observation about Italians that she does not seem to realize could apply to her fellow British as well.
  A wistful moment arises during a coach ride when the driver, Phaeton ( Lucca Rossi) must part with his sweetheart, Persephone(Isabella Celani) so he can focus on his work.
 To the aria "" Chi Il Bel Sogno Di Doretta"" (as sung by Kiri Te Kanawa), we reach a point of high drama during the trip to Italy when Lucy and George kiss in an open field, only to find Lucy hastily returned to the protective custody of Charlotte and Eleanor.
  Soon, all are home again, and we view the contrasting staidness of the English countryside at the Honeychurch home of Windy Corner. Mrs. Marion Honeychurch(Rosemary Leach)presides over a residence that will witness her daughter's engagement to Cecil, amid the visible apprehension of Lucy's brother, Freddy(Rupert Graves), gatherings attended by Reverend Beebe's niece, Minnie(an Alice-in-Wonderland like Mia Fothergill), and one slightly racy adventure in a nearby lake as the drama continues.
  George and his father soon move nearby Windy Corner, and Lucy is compelled to rethink certain life-altering decisions.
  Ultimately, the best result will occur, Lucy will find herself back at the pensione with the proper husband, and we will see the cycle of the young English girl, a chaperone, elderly spinster sisters, English clergymen,  the free-spirit with an elderly father, and the debate over whether or not to have a room with a view on one's first trip to Italy renew itself.
  From Dame Kiri's initial and final notes of ""O Mio Babbio Cara"" to the decorative style of the credits, this film remains a delightful masterpiece.",1251417600,,3002,5.114754098360656
273855,4,6300250512,"This film is based on the novel of the same name by E.M.Forster, published in 1908, and is set in Florence, Italy and the English countryside. The movie is a coming of age story about the freeing of self from the repression of British upper class manners and mores. This is a hysterically humorous life affirming film filled with hilarious performances, from the pompous Cecil (Daniel Day Lewis), to the awkward Charlotte (Maggie Smith), to the demented old woman with flowers in her hair. Things get off to a bit of a slow start, and the stabbing in the square, reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, comes across as contrived. Initially the blossoming love affair between Lucy (Helena Bonham Carter) and George (Julian Sands) seems to take second stage to the the joyous expression of life conveyed by the multiple characters. When the three men jump naked into the pond and splash about it seems as if George could just as easily have formed a relationship with either of the other men. George loves life, and is an expression of life, and his attraction to Lucy seems as if it's only a reflection of his love for life itself. Lucy though has something boiling deep inside her too, and her love of Beethoven's music reflects this, but it takes some time before this intensity rises to the surface and she comes into her own.

Seeing the young Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Day Lewis is a treat. Helena's shy, naive character is a curious thing to  watch early on given that her later movie roles are so energized. It is only about three quarters of the way through the film, once she rejects Cecil, that she truly blossoms and comes into her own. It's as if she sees her potential for the first time, and she seems repeatedly pleasantly surprised to find that she has this other side.

Daniel Day Lewis portrays his character with the same wry wit that we have come to enjoy in his more recent films. When we hear that Cecil is taking Lucy's snub hard there is nothing further from the truth. Cecil's character is a humorous study of an individual enclosed in his self satisfied intellectualized world, who seems out of touch with everything. Daniel Day Lewis seems to relish the role and pushes his character to the edge of absurd.

The romance between Lucy and George never really seems real until the very end when they are in Florence sitting in the frame of the window kissing. George is an uninhibited young man, and Lucy reacts to his stolen kisses early on with surprise. Gradually this vibrant young man awakens something within her. This shift is accentuated by the shift from the stuffy ornate interiors seen earlier in the film to the natural environments of fields and ponds Lucy and George find themselves surrounded by later on.

Julian Sands, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliot, and Simon Callow also star.

This film is a gorgeously filmed movie, from the rich interiors to the marvelous landscapes, and the Blu-ray transfer takes full advantage of this.",1250380800,7,2976,4.713461538461538

Her performance strikes just the right balance of humor and drama and combined with clever dialogue, a dramatic, passionate plot, gorgeous scenery, and a Puccini-driven score, makes for an award-worthy film.

Don't think for a minute that this is some staid, English period piece. A Room with a View is a rolicking journey through Italy, London, and the English countryside, in the company of several fine performers: Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliot, Judi Dench, and Daniel Day-Lewis.  Julian Sands turns in a charming performance as a secret suitor to Bonham-Carter's Lucy Honeychurch.

The only caution I can make is the male nudity in the film's bathing scene.  While it does add to the humor of the picture, I feel the full frontal nudity went too far.  Did we really need to see three sets of family jewels dangling out in the open air?  Leave a little to the imagination, but don't leave this one on the shelf.",1210291200,3,1081,4.74331550802139

However, my fears are completely dispelled. The BBC have produced a tremendous transfer which brings about as much depth, color and detail as can be expected from 20 year old film stock. The details in the ornate interiors, the delicate dresses, the frescoes, the faces, and the lush countryside are beautifully rendered, and the colors, though saturated, appear very natural. True, there is a bit of dot crawl now and again and the blacks are not always as deep as we have come to expect but overall this is a fantastic restoration that breathes new life into an exquisite movie and is a huge improvement over the standard version. Coupled with incredible acting, delightful irony and strong direction, this comedy of manners and sensitive portait of physical awakening in a constricted era, becomes a wonderful experience that I strongly recommend.",1192924800,9,1016,5.053571428571429

Helena Bonham Carter's subtle movements say more than 100 words of dialogue. The Tuscan scenery is beautiful and the charachters and story give us a great overview of customs and mores in Edwardian England.

Since this is a review of the HD DVD release of the movie, let me make a few comments about it. Unfortunately the transfer is uneven. It does not appear that an actual restoration of the original print was attempted and therefore the colors are not as vibrant as much older films like ""The Searchers"" or ""Forbidden Planet"". There is considerable and unnecessary grain in the opening credits that could easily have been cleaned up to give a better first impression of the movie. Some scenes look better than others and overall I thought that such a good movie deserved a better treatment. Warner Bros is way ahead of other studios when it comes to taking care of their catalogue titles and other studios should do the same.

This is a 5 star movie but due to the reasons a mentioned above I give it 4 stars overall. It's only a slight improvement over DVD, but if you don't own this title or have not seen the movie you should definitely buy it and enjoy it.",1191369600,12,1294,4.478813559322034

Beautiful shots of Florence, the narrow side streets, the Piazza Santissima Annunziata with the facade of Brunelleschi's Spedale degli Innocenti (the first foundling hospital in Europe and the first truly Renaissance building), views of the Duomo from across the Arno, the church of Santa Croce, the Tuscan countryside were all lovely.

The acting was excellent and it was a beautiful love story. The sound track was bellisimma!

The only minor flaws were talking about the equestrian statue in the piazza Santissima Annunziata, possibly one of the least appealing statues in Florence and ignoring the Spedale degli Innocenti which was right there.

Also, the negative comments about the frescoes of St. Francis in the church of Santa Croce I could have personally done without.

That being said it was a lovely film and took me right back to Florence which is one of the most lovely cities on earth. Who cannot love Florence? Could there be a more beautiful setting for a love story?

The fight in the piazza della Signoria was gratuitous but it gave me a chance to be transported there once again so I didn't ming the fight.  It was a great excuse for the camera man to film the beautiful statues in the loggia della Lanzi by the Uffizi.

I really enjoyed this film for its wonderful acting, great cinematography and beautiful soundtrack.

But, it did kindle what I hope is a lifelong love of Italy - next year, Rome, Capri! Somehow, though, I think I will always come back to Florence. Eleanor Lavish makes a cogent statement when she says young Lucy is transfigured by Italy - and why should she not be? It happened to the gods! This dialog ran through my mind over and over again as I wondered the ancient streets, falling in love with everything I could take in with five senses: smells, language, music, sights.

The other thing I absolutely loved about this film was Daniel Day-Lewis playing so against character as Cecil. Talk about a 180 from Last of the Mohicans, or My Left Foot for that matter. He is truly a master at the art of acting.",1173830400,5,875,4.265060240963855

274065,5,6300250512,"I read Forster's novel and tumbled unexpectedly, as Lucy did into a field of flowers, in love with the wistful, romantic prose and nostalgic ode to a bygone era, so it was with a fair amount of trepidation that I watched Merchant-Ivory's film version: I thought that nobody could ever match the vivid imagery of Forster's text.

I was happily mistaken. Merchant-Ivory truly understand Forster's quiet power: they subtly transmute a delightful novel into a visual feast that is as much a love letter to Italy and young love as it is the classic story of ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl"". The actors are perfectly cast: Helena Bonham Carter has that wilful, slightly petulant pre-Raphaelite air that is perfectly Lucy Honeychurch, while Julian Sands (who unfortunately did not appear in much else of note afterwards) is earnestly romantic but not laughably melodramatic. The music is beautiful, at times achingly so, and I defy anyone to remain unmoved by the scene where Lucy is first held by George in a field of violets. It could've so easily tipped over into cliches and hackneyed romance, but somehow it still feels fresh, lovely and wide-eyed.

Stand-out performances from Daniel Day Lewis (as the priggish Cecil) and Helena Bonham Carter, as well as from Judi Dench (Eleanor Lavish) and Maggie Smith (as ""poor, poor Charlotte""). Honorable mentions to Rupert Graves as Freddy (Lucy's loveable and mischievous brother) and Simon Callow as Reverend Beebe.

Merchant-Ivory has a reputation for corseted period pieces, but the exquisite loveliness and joy of this film should appeal to just about anybody with a pulse. It is one of those films that you will watch again and again, and each time you will have tears come to your eyes and a lump in  your throat from the sheer beauty of it all.

On a technical note, I would not get anything less than the 2-disc special edition (part of the Merchant-Ivory collection), which comes in beautiful matte packaging and includes a documentary with commentary from the cast and crew. The sound and picture quality is fine (at least on my DVD player) -- not 100% crisp as the original film is from the 80s, but a modern, digital sharpness would most likely detract rather than add to the film anyway, in my opinion.

If you liked this film, I would also recommend that you seek out other Merchant-Ivory films such as Howards End and Maurice (both Forster adaptations -- the latter with Hugh Grant in a role far removed from his Four Weddings/Notting Hill persona) and Heat and Dust (set in British India, this film has an oddly intense, exotic melancholy that lingers long after you've watched it.)",1165795200,10,2654,4.860619469026549

274069,5,6300250512,"When I watched this film for the first time several years ago, I thought it was mind-numbingly boring.  Now that I've become a big fan of film adaptations and, more important, period pieces, I thought it would be fair to give this film a second chance.  A Room with a View is a beautiful, passionate love story that keeps real to E.M. Forster's novel.  This is the story of Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and the choices she has to make.  Should she choose her boring, but socially approved fianc&eacute; Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis) or should she follow her heart and choose the adorable and passionate George (Julian Sands), whom she met during a trip to Florence, Italy?  Should she settle for the demands and social mores of Edwardian England?

The story is slow-paced and subtle.  It focuses more on the decisions Lucy has to make.  Some people may consider it boring.  I, however, think it is one of the best love stories out there.  The actors are all magnificent.  Helena Bonham-Carter, Daniel Day-Lewis and Julian Sands are wonderful.  The scenes where the men bathe naked at the lake is my favorite scene.  Yes, there is explicit male nudity in this scene, but I like the fact that they show men frolicking in such an innocent way.  I thought it was endearing and the acting wonderful.  As for the rest of the cast, Judi Dench and Simon Callow are also great.  The production is an eyeful.  The wardrobe, sets, scenery (especially the scenes in Italy) and backdrop of the Edwardian period (this is not a Victorian, like other reviewers have said) are breathtaking.  James Ivory and the BBC went all the way with the quality of the direction and production.  This movie was released in 1986 and the DVD's digital remastering is excellent.  It adds dimensions to this already beautiful film.  If you love classic love stories and you're a period film enthusiast, I recommend A Room with a View.

Forster had a genius for developing characters and for showing the awesome and sometime awful complexities that arise when people interract. James Ivory, thanks to a brilliant casting director, had the right actors to bring these characters to life on the screen: Helen Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Simon Callow, Julian Sands, Daniel Day-Lewis, etc. What this permitted Ivory to do was to focus on another equally important element in film making: to give us something beautiful to look at. The shots of a small Engish village, the lusty Italian countryside, the polish of an upper class English garden are nothing short of breathtaking. It enhances the romance, heightens the humor (especially when an English minister decides to skinny dip with a few parishoners in a hysterical scene), and convinces us that this was how life was for these remarkable characters.

One of the Merchant-Ivory's best collaborations, this dvd also comes with some insightful commentary and a unique look at E.M. Forster's life. I recommend it highly.",1154304000,8,1269,5.096153846153846

Actor's voices have lost the human richness-- esp the women's voices which sound higher pitched and slightly annoying. Even the music and sound effects sound a little ""off.""

The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate.

Now twenty years since the first release of the movie, we can relive the discovery of love between George Emerson and Lucy Honeychurch on a high-definition quality DVD.  The beauty of Florence is captured even more so on DVD than I remember. The digital remastering is so stunning.

Watching Daniel Day Lewis play the bookish and unpassionate Cecil Vyse, after watching him in so many heroically masculine roles, is a treasure.  He's not the raskish, broad-chested Mohican but the tall wiry, stiff erudite played spot on.  Julian Sands is at his best in this film.  After the Warlock movies, it kind of petered out from there.

274149,2,6300250512,"""A Room With A View"" remains one of those special cinematic experiences: verdant landscapes, gorgeous costumes, immaculate art direction, a stellar cast, and above all a simple yet well-written story.  This is truly the crown jewel of Merchant Ivory productions.

Which is why this ""special edition"" of ""A Room With A View"" is so disappointing.  Presumably, with a 2-disc version of a film, one would expect a wealth of supplementary material to justify the purchase, and it was with great expectation that I ordered this edition of ""A Room With a View.""  Unfortunately, the bonus features did not live up to the high quality I have come to expect from Merchant Ivory or the moniker ""special edition.""

The highlight of disc 1 is the audio commentary with James Ivory, Ismail Merchant, Simon Callow, and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts.  The commentary begin vigorously enough, with interesting anecdotes about filming in Florence, working with the actors, and bringing the production together.  About midway through the film, however, the conversation begins to diminish, and long periods of time go without anything being said.  You would think that with four such charming, garrulous, and immensely creative artists someone could think of something to say, but as the silences multiply and prolong I got the sense that they were either to shy or too absorbed in watching the picture--which is understandable (it is a lovely film, and one would hate to interrupt the impeccable dialogue or Robbins' soundtrack), but the joy of audio commentary is precisely to hear the filmmakers talking over the movie.  As I watched I kept hoping that someone would chime in about a particular shot, costume detail, or production note, but it was not to be.  By the end the commentary dies out completely, and even when the final credits roll there is not even a word of goodbye to be heard.  Even the subtitles left much to be desired.  The English subtitles often left out certain details and the French subtitles had odd translations (at one point coming up with two different translations for ""fish pie,"" a strange inconsistancy).

Disc 2 is the greater let-down.  A second disc of material should be overloaded with delights, particularly--one would assume--vignettes and detours made especially for this DVD release.  Sadly, however, Disc 2's offerings are all archival and can be viewed in less than half an hour, nowhere near as much information that would justify a second disc.  The gallery of images from the film are pretty to look at but are unexceptional.  The extras consist of old BBC interviews and shorts, the most recent dating from 1996.  For those of us who are even moderately aware of Merchant Ivory's career, the information is shopworn and not at all enlightening.  Indeed, the most compelling features are the 70s and 80s clothing and hairstyles of the BBC employees.  Whereas the film seems timeless, this material definitely shows its age.

Merchant Ivory, ""A Room With a View,"" and we viewers deserve better than this.  To promise so much and to deliver so little is atypical of what we have come to expect from this production team.  To me, Merchant Ivory is synonymous with high quality, careful attention to detail, and good value--and alas this edition of ""A Room With A View"" is none of these things.  It grieves me to write this of a film I consider my most favorite of all films, and yet I hope that perhaps in another few years or so a better and more fitting ""special edition"" will emerge.",1136073600,16,3518,4.9438775510204085
274150,4,6300250512,"One of the lushest and most exquisite films ever, 'A Room With A View' from Merchant Ivory offers a stunning adaptation of the beloved story from E.M. Forster. With an all-star cast, beautiful Italian and English settings, and gorgeous music, this film is a masterpiece of its medium. Helena Bonhan Carter plays the protagonist, Lucy Honeychurch, who meets the handsome and intriguing George(Julian Sands) while on holiday in Italy. His unconventional ways put her off at first, but the more she gets to know him, the more interesting he becomes. However, when she returns home to England, she has to put all thoughts of George out of her mind because she becomes engaged to Cecil(Daniel Day-Lewis) even though he is boring and conventional. When she comes across George in England (swimming naked no less), she begins to question her relationship with Cecil and wonder about who she really wants to be with.

274154,5,6300250512,"This was one of the outstanding movies of the times. It features one of the greatest stories showing the moving from Italy to England back to Italy. It captures the blossoming of a girl in Italy and features one of the greatest cast. Every one of the persons from Helena Bonham Carter to Daniel Day Lewis as the insufferable Cecil Vyse did a wonderful job. Maggie Carter was superb as ""poor Charlotte"" as was Simon Callow as reverent Mr. Beebe. Judy Dench was also great as Miss Lavish, the ubiquitous novelist. Forster took a trip to Italy in 1901 and the book came out in 1908 after considerable rewriting. This was one of the best romance novels that was made into a movie and the screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala rightly won the oscar.

Even the humor is unusual and understated. When the English chaplain in Florence, Mr Eager, takes people to see a chapel, Denholm Elliot, as Mr Emerson, shows Lucy Honeychurch around. At one point, Mr Eager remarks ""Remember that this chapel was built in faith during the full fervor of medievalism"". This prompt Mr Emerson to retort ""Built by faith indeed. It simply means that the workers were not paid enough"". Scenes were the brother and sister are together are especially wonderful. One of the best scenes is the one in the lake where the three take a bath and are discovered. Forster was always not one to go with the flow of the era and this story captures the essence of a person who is engaged to a rich person but is in love with a free spirited person, George Emerson. It shows how she is in a quandary and decides to break the engagement and marry George which would have been scandalous in those times.

This movie is a shining example of maximum Merchant-Ivory ability to achieve maximum quality and opulence at minimum cost. A winner of three Academy Awards, A Room with a View is not what one could call fast-moving, but fans of the Merchant-Ivory team will enjoy luxuriating in the film's leisurely pace and stimulating cast of characters.  I for one feel that the DVD is well made and the problems are minor. Despite issues pointed out by previous reviewers, this is still one of the outstanding movies made.

""A Room with a View"" was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture. It was considered an art house crowd pleaser, and it shows. The cast was incredible (especially Maggie Smith as the annoying ""poor Charlotte""). In addition, the directing, writing, and technical values are all note-worthy. This movie is a good example of a period piece that delights yet at the same time remains true to the spirit of the era it depicts and the source material.

DVD Review- Unfortunately some complaints about the audio track (only for the 2004 Two-Disc) are valid. I remember watching it and hearing Dame Judi Dench sounding more high pitch than normal (I thought, ""She definitely doesn't talk like that""). Actually, I found the problem a little strange only when Judi Dench and Maggie Smith talked. For some it might not be a problem. However, for those who have heard the earlier editions (on DVD and VHS), it could be a distraction. However, for some reason by the middle of the film I didn't notice it anymore. I hope BBC who I believe released this edition will address this.",1115424000,7,1203,4.839805825242719

274189,5,6300250512,"""A Room With a View"" is the most exquisite movie that I've ever seen. The august artistic vision of Misters Merchant and Ivory is awe-inspiring. I'd place their achievement at number one atop my list of favorite films--which is no mean feat as there are at least 100 that I'd rate with five stars.  The production is pure transcendence and bears little in relation to normal life.

Where does one begin regarding ""A Room with a View""? So many themes are developed in these two hours, such as the way that love is forged in times of danger and stress along with nature's power to undermine societal repression.

It is one of the few movies that is stronger than the book upon which it is based.  It can be interpreted as pure romance and also, independently, as a satire on the Victorian age.  I saw it the theatre for the first time at age 17, and it continues to haunt me eighteen years later.

This movie launched Julian Sands, Simon Callow, and Daniel Day Lewis as serious actors.  It also features British acting legends like Denholm Elliott, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench.  Overall, there is not one bad performance in this film.  As if it needed any more recommendations, the soundtrack is also extraordinary.  You must own this film.  It is not a rental. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Lucy Honeychurch, is a paragon of joyous feminity that few on this earth are capable of living up to.  She is an ideal as are all of these characters.

This is a depiction of romantic love rarely found on the big screen. You vividly see the passion that forms between George and Lucy, and its force is infinitely believable.  The way in which the audience is allowed to witness their attraction is quite rare.  In comparison, a strong film like ""Sense and Sensibility"" becomes weak tea.  You cheer for these lovers and long to know what happens in the future.  If all lives were like these, then every death would become calamitious tragedy.  This movie is the closest many of us will ever come to the sublime.",1110067200,10,1995,4.5875706214689265

George Emerson, the son of Mr. Emerson (the comedic pair residing in Italy at the time of Lucy Honeychurch and Charlotte Bartlett's stay there) Lucy Honeychurch and Cecil Vyse are possibly some of the most vivid characters ever created. Each is cut precisely and perfectly to take their place in the film--the quiet but extremely individual George, the pouty and strong-willed Lucy, or the antisocial, self-centered Cecil.

This is one of those elegant Merchant-Ivory productions (which also include Maurice and A Passage to India, other E.M. Forster adaptations to film) that sets the late Victorian/early twentieth century world in upper- to upper-middle class England in such gracious light.
The stars of this film include Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy, the heroine, and Julian Sands as George Emerson, her free-spirited suitor, who shocks everyone by doing such risque things as running around without a jacket, or kissing someone (willing) in a field of poppies.  The official suitor of Lucy is the stuffed-shirt Cecil Vyse, whose personality seems like it is jammed in a vise.  There are great performances by Judi Dench (as a conventional free-spirit, one who likes to be freespirited but not at the expense of reputation), Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, Denhom Elliot, and an outstanding performance (as always, she just has to walk on the set and the film gets an extra star) by Maggie Smith, as the gossipy and fretting aunt and chaperone to Lucy, who eventually comes round to recognizing and rejoicing in the true love of Lucy and George.
The sets are beautiful, the costumes all very much a part of the period, as are the small touches that make up the style of English society that Forster was trying to expose and celebrate in different ways both at the same time.

Obviously I loved the film when it was originally released, and plenty of others did as well-see reviews below.

It could have been shot yesterday.  I'd be willing to bet that in 15 years ""Shakespeare in Love"" *will* look somehow ""late '90s""-it's the norm for period costume pieces to wind up reflecting the styles of the times they were made, even if we can't see it without the distance of years passing.

And the kissing scenes!!! The type that makes your hear go pitter patter and faint. When George first kisses Lucy without any reservations or hesitation- so passsionate! Then he does it again back in England so boldly, since Lucy's fiance Cecil is but a few feet away. The last scene where Lucy and George are kissing and the windows are open letting the view come forth, this is more emotionally charged and sexual than any sex scene I have ever come across in any movie.

Hard to believe that Julian Sands did not become a major romantic lead after this movie. (He could have been like Hugh Grant or better yet Colin Firth or even his costar  Daniel Day Lewis) I think he needs to find another agent. I've seen him in other movies though I didn't really notice him until this one. And his other movies are quite bad. Sad to think this movie close to 20 years old is his highlight.  He gives such a good performance as George Emerson. He doesn't say much but when he does it's full of meaning. His facial expressions say much more than words could.  And just the way he looks at Lucy....when he is looking at her feet after they are done playing tennis - it literally takes my breath away. How could he make looking at feet look so sexy, hot and deliciously wicked all at the same time?!

Daniel Day Lewis as Cecil. Cecil is such a bore,.but I mean it in a good way. Didn't exude any type of sexuality or passion in the least. Hard to believe this is the same guy who made women watch Last of The Mohicans over and over just for him and become so violent in Gangs of New York. Daniel Day Lewis did such a good job with this part I barely recognized him.

Helena Bonham Carter - repressed yet so full of possibilites. And very innocent - was this really the same woman in Fight Club! Demure yet becoming increasingly vocal. And she's gone on to such great roles after this.

There are just too many great actors to name. I love Denholm Holt who played Mr. Emerson. He was so endearing and charming.

Maggie Smith plays the  chaperone! Maybe you can get Julian Sands a role in the next Harry Potter movie.

This is such a beauitiful movie. I just wish the DVD had more extras. I wish it had some interviews with all the cast members, and a making of the movie. I would give it 5 stars, but the lack of extras on the DVD earns it a 4.",1082246400,6,2546,4.283333333333333
274242,4,6300250512,"""A Room With A View"" is the sumptuous Merchant/Ivory production of E.M. Forster's novel about a young woman, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) who longs to escape her clausterphobic life. To this end she's drawn to two men of varying virtue; George (Julian Sands) a fiery, passionate dreamer - alive with living, and Cecil (Daniel Day Lewis) the snobbish and stale, though socially acceptable, man about town. This is a fabulous production, elegantly mounted and rich in stellar acting and performances that sadly, are in very short supply in today's cinema. Particularly with Bonham-Carter, one simply wishes that she would play more such roles.
TRANSFER: At long last, yes! After a previously issued disc that frankly, wasn't worth the cheap piece of plastic it was recorded on, this new 2-disc version does right on all accounts. The picture is stunning in a new 16:9 anamorphic transfer. Colors are rich and well balanced. Contrast and shadow levels are bang on. There is some slight shimmering but nothing to terribly distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely represented. The music is the real kicker here.
EXTRAS: Some interesting archival footage, a BBC featurette, a bit about the author and a very informative audio commentary.
BOTTOM LINE: This is a keeper!",1081209600,11,1270,5.140096618357488
274253,1,6300250512,"A Room with a View (James Ivory, 1985)
A room with a View is your typical Merchant/Ivory production, which means it's very pretty, based on a deadly dull novel, and chock full of incredible actors. In this case, Ismail and James did the world the credit of introducing them to the irrepressible Helena Bonham-Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club), Rupert Graves (Bent, The Forsyte Saga), and Mia Fothergil (Stanley's Dragon, Sparrow), among others, while reminding us of the existence of such then-established stars as Julian Sands, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliott, and Simon Callow, not a one of whom should need the merest speck of introduction.
I mentioned in a recent review of the film Iris that I was under the impression that Judi Dench could take the worst possible film and make it watchable. While A Room with a View doesn't rate worst possible film status, this is the one time I have ever seen a Judi Dench film and been compelled not to watch the whole thing. It's a confused mess. A very pretty one, I grant you, and reasonably well-acted (though some of those here seemed to be sleepwalking through their parts), but it seemed at time as if the editor had gone off on some mad, creative romp with the source footage in an attempt to make the onscreen action make as little sense as possible. A dress rehearsal, I daresay, for their painful attempt to adapt Slaves of New York a few years later.
It should come as little surprise that while the film was nominated for a slew of both Oscars and BAFTA Awards, it's strongest showing was in the visual field (Art Design and Costume Design in America coupled with Set Design in England).
Perhaps it will be clearer after seeing it a few more times, but only time will tell, with so many other movies out there to be seen, whether I'll ever give it another shot.",1078704000,8,1823,4.612307692307692

So I decided to take a look to the movie, and even though I enjoyed ""A Room With A View"", and every minute gets more and more interesting, I really don't think that this movie can compare with ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Ben-Hur"" as one of the best movies of all time.
Anyway, the movie does have a lot of highlights: the cast is very good, the movie displays performances from nice actors, such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Maggie Smith and Helena Bonham Carter. The direction of James Ivory is outstanding, the photography, the set design, well everything is carefully designed.
If you like period films, you will love ""A Room With A View"". If you want to see why this movie is so beloved, go ahead, watch it, you might love it. I don't think ""A Room With A View"" is a masterpiece, but you will at least enjoy this film, that's for sure.",1076284800,4,931,4.35632183908046

I am going to Italy in October and cannot wait to see it; if it is anywhere near as stunning as it is in the movie, my airfare will be well worth it.

I would highly suggest one also purchase the CD soundtrack; it is superb and a delightful respite, especially with hot bath, wine, and candles added to the mix.  I wore out the VHS and now have the DVD and will probably wear it out, as well.

Helena Bonham-Carter is at her best, and what film could possibly be less than magnificent when it boasts the talents of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench?  Even my husband, who is certainly no fan of any movie that does not include firearms, finds himself fascinated against his will by Daniel Day-Lewis' spot-on portrayal of sissified Cecil.

One of the most perfect films ever made, in my opinion, with gorgeous Italian and English scenery, world-class actors, and of course, the perfect story by Edward Morgan Forster about class and protocol in Edwardian England.

274257,5,6300250512,"This exquisite classic of Merchant-Ivory is sensually explores the struggle between the tight exterior of the British upper crust and the seething passion that lurks just beneath in the increasingly powerful middle class. You've seen a movie or two for sure that veer around such themes, but very few films have captured this combination of class struggle and personal liberation any more evocatively!
Our protagonist is a young, passionate and repressed Miss Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter in possibly her best role ever) who exemplifies this unspoken inner-outer conflict. As she struggles between what is expected of her, to marry the effete and obnoxious Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day Lewis in a richly textured performance), and what she really wants, to be with the yearning, romantic George Emerson (a soft and unfocused Julian Sands) Miss Honeychurch must juggle class concerns and personal desires.
As with any Merchant Ivory product, the all-round cast is vivid and intriguing. Maggie Smith never leaves a dull moment in any of her movies, a credo she maintains here as well as Lucy's nervous and confused escort -- for which she received a well deserved Oscar. As George's bewildered and sweet father, the marvellous Denholm Elliot steals every scene in which he appears. Lastly, Simon Callow as the ebullient, robust Reverend Beebe captures all that is good and true about humanity.
A word for the DVD. The cinematography in this movie sparkles, and the DVD does complete justice to Ivory's camera skills -- the shots are so pure you will want to taste the dew resting atop the grass in the sumptuous English gardens.
What a complete movie, full of life, love and hope! Highly recommended for your collections, you'll watch this more than once.",1069027200,17,1757,5.104166666666667
274258,5,6300250512,"My sister-in-law said this was one of her favourite, if not her favourite movie.  Upon my second viewing of this, I began to see why.
While on vacation in Florence, the issue of a woman liking a view comes up while Lucy Honeychurch and her chaperone and cousin Charlotte are dining at their hotel.  The Reverend Emerson and his son George, offer to swap rooms, a transaction the ever cautious Charlotte shudders to consider, as she worries of Lucy making future obligations to strangers, but the Reverend Beebe, also on vacation, offers to act as intermediary, and Lucy gets her view.
The catalytic scene that sets the story rolling is when the usually brooding George, comes upon Lucy standing in the sea of tall waving glasses, and without preamble, kisses her.  He feels that something tremendous has happened to them.  This episode is observed by Charlotte, who guilt-ridden at her failure as a chaperone, immediately whisks Lucy away.
Months later, in England, we learn that Lucy has been engaged to Cecil Vyse, a haughty, self-involved man with oiled black hair and mustache too wrapped up in books and art, who thinks reading aloud to women makes him God's gift to them.  The trouble with him, though, as George Emerson points out to Lucy, is that George will see Lucy as just a possession, something to look at, something to own and display, like a painting or ivory box.""  Lucy will be an extension of Cecil, without any regard to her own thoughts and feelings.
And an opening up of feelings contrary to the conventions of a repressed society is what Lucy needs, to be honest with and to logically come to term with her feelings, but she tells lie upon lie not only to others, but worst of all, to herself.
Overall, this details how one can use rational thought and emotional feelings in conjunction.  The fact that George's surname is identical to Ralph Waldo Emerson is ironic, considering how transcendentalism stressed the use of intuition over reason.  What's stressed here is the merging of both to make one whole.  And there's also the importance of how lucky people to find what's right for them.
And how one's talents conceal the potential for passion.  Reverend Beebe twice remarks on this, first on Lucy's musical skills.  ""She plays Beethoven with such passion and lives so quietly.  One day, music and life will mingle and she will be wonderful in both."" and also, ""If she ever takes to live as she plays, it would be very exciting for both of us and for her.""  In other words, the view one seeks is the inner bliss within.
I see this as Helena Bonham-Carter's definitive film.  And I've always been used to seeing Denholm Elliott as a mere supporting actor, but he does have a very potent part here as Mr. Emerson, a tried and true romantic.  As he says when discussing the swap of rooms, ""I don't care what I see outside.  My vision is within.""  He then fervently places his fist over his heart.  ""Here is where the bird sings.  Here is where the sky is blue.""  His placing cornflowers in Miss Catherine Alan's hair is ample evidence of that, describing flowers as ""no jewels more becoming to a lady.""  Simon Callow (Reverend Beebe) is yet another character who sees potential in Lucy.
The scenes in Italy, the English countryside, and the costumes flesh out this cinematic adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel outlining the conflict between inner and outer halves of ourselves.",1062806400,10,3400,4.728813559322034

A spectacular rendition of book-into-film that is essentially true to every luscious class tease and twist of Forster's original book. It's a not-so-subtle study of the British class system of rigidly circumscribed behaviors that conspire to keep Lucy Honeychurch from admitting even to herself her love for her free-spirited suitor, a young man deemed uncouth and unworthy, especially by her protective aunt/traveling companion, splendidly played by the inimitable Maggie Smith, who has every twitch and raised eyebrow and swish of the skirts down pat.
Marvelous scenes that will stay with me always, especially the women coming upon the naked men at the swimming hole, and Maggie Smith trying to figure out how to make change for the coachman.

Closer to my heart, this movie has one of the keenest understandings ever put on film of the Italian/aesthetic way of life. The incredible romance, history, natural beauty and rich approach to life that the country evokes shine through in every frame shot in Italy. The movie does a great job of showing the difference between actually living this way (the two leads and Emerson) versus merely mouthing the words of it (Cecil) and conforming to restrictive societal conventions.

And the infamous scene with the men running around the watering hole is reason enough to purchase the film.

274262,5,6300250512,"Having first viewed this film for a literature class years ago, I must say this remains a truly fine screen adaptation and a timeless classic of the heritage film genre. E.M. Forster was a novelist and keen observer of human nature ahead of his time. Through the device of the central love story between sweet yet self-deceiving Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter), bohemian and enigmatic George Emerson (Julian Sands) and the priggish and intellectual dilettante Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis), the film asks why and how we as human beings go to such lengths to conceal our true feelings (e.g. love, happiness, displeasure, loneliness) from the world. Is it from fear of impropriety, embarassment, and/or judgement? In Lucy's case, it is all of these. One may add that for the rest of us that applies quite well even in our daily 21st century context. Forster once said (and I paraphrase here) that the most important thing is to ""only connect."" He meant that in the most general sense whether it is a man and woman and/or human being to human being.
As the elder Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliot) claims so whole-heartedly, ""I don't believe in this world sorrow,"" to the young and awkward Lucy (Bonham-Carter), Forster wonderfully explores how a tradition-bound society (e.g. 19thc Edwardian England) has perpetuated a romanticized notion of repression as stoic fortitude to earthly temptation. He exposes this as a sham - contrary to the complex truths of human nature (both beauty and warts!) A love of life is the most important thing to strive for and that includes a healthy indulgence in earthly pleasures before us.
There are remarkable performances all around - Maggie Smith as prudish Charlotte Bartlett, Lucy's cousin and chaperone, Denholm Elliot as the eccentric, free-thinking Mr. Emerson, Julian Sands as George Emerson, Lucy's stalwart and soulful suitor, and Daniel Day-Lewis' Cecil Vyse, the last of the genteel gentleman of leisure, an absolutely hilarious embodiment of all that is comical and hypocritical about the tradition-bound society in question. Superb Italian landscapes from old Florence - Santa Croce, the campanile, the Arno River to the sun-drenched Tuscan countryside where Lucy has her epiphany about her true feelings and thus, her path in life, one traversed upon sans Baedeker.
It is too bad films like this one is seemingly passe at the moment and/or has become a source of irony in themselves. Let just hope this is a temporary phase.",1056844800,17,2473,5.123762376237623
274303,5,6300250512,"In this period piece, Helena Bonham Carter and her aunt Maggie Smith go on vacation in Florence, encountering novelist Judi Dench, Reverend Simon Callow, and Denholm Elliot and his son Julian Sands.  Smith cuts the trip short after witnessing a passionate kiss between Bonham Carter and Sands.  Back in England, Bonham Carter ends up engaged to stuffy, serious snob Daniel Day-Lewis, while Sands and his father end up living in town.  Needless to say, all of this leads to complications.
As one would expect from a Merchant-Ivory film, the performances are all top standard. Bonham Carter is excellent as the girl struggling against the growing passions inside her.  Smith excels as the fussy, proper, but deeply concerned aunt.  Day-Lewis is terrific in a most untypical role, while Sands is very strong as his counterpoint.  The supporting cast are all terrific as well.
As one would also expect from Merchant-Ivory, the attention to period detail is amazing and the script is very literate.  It is a bit slow in parts, but the development of the characters and the manner in which thoughts and feelings are conveyed without words makes up for it.  The meaning of the title becomes only too evident by the end.  Everybody on a trip loves a room with a view.  But the same should apply to our everyday life.

Each time I find the last visit more memorable: so much have been evaporated since.  Yet it's captured and preserved so intact in this movie.
So EM Forster liked switching settings a lot. On the last occasion it was the orient in ""A passage to India"". This time  it's Italy. But the central theme is much the same, it's about human relationship, depicted also in the form of romance of course. But it doesn't stop there, there is much more depth and insight than that.
Like Miss Quested in A Passage to India, the heroine's Freudian instinct was aroused by the images in the square right at the time she chanced into the hero of this film. Is class a necessary barrier to human relationship?... And, is class a guaranty to human understanding, as could be seen from the relationship between the heroine and her fiance?

One can't help but wonder what a mess would have been made of the film had another actor had this pivotal part that could so easily have been overplayed.
Helena Bonham Carter gives a lovely performance and is stunningly beautiful, and it is interesting to watch this film and compare it to the performance she would give many years later in ""The Wings of the Dove"" (which I personally consider her acting masterpiece to date, and a film which is criminally under-acknowledged).

I have read lately that she wants to star in non-period movies (forget the Planet of the Apes...thank goodness, the DVD was a gift) but she cannot help it, her role as Lucy Honeychurch is delightfully splendid in this movie, it was worthy of an Oscar, a Cesar or the BAFTA award for Best Actress.

The film begins in the beautiful city of Florence, where romantic tensions begin to develop between the young and inexperienced Lucy Honeychurch and the radical George Emerson, and takes us on to the British countryside, where Lucy struggles to resolve her longings. The tale of a young girl breaking free from the protective shell of her adolescence is an endearing one, scripted and played with a comedic edge. The humour flows naturally from the situation and the characters, and is therefore gentle and unforced. The cast are outstanding, particularly in some of the supporting roles: Daniel Day Lewis is deliciously pretentious as Cecil; Simon Callow and Denholm Elliot also shine in minor roles.
Nothing here is overstated. The beauty of the locations and the characters are allowed to speak for themselves without heavy-handed direction or overly lavish treatment. Forster's story is brought to life in an uncluttered and lasting way.",1012262400,2,994,5.2578616352201255
274348,4,6300250512,"No one can argue that this isn't a breathtakingly perfect adaptation of Forster's wonderful novel.  Every actor is sublime, every title card and set detail is perfect, each moment is drenched with the sensibility of the English Italophiles of the time. I will always remember with pleasure the evening I first saw this magical film. I have seen it dozens of times since, and it was one of the first DVD purchases I made.

Brilliance of the film aside, the DVD is a disappointment.  It is incredibly stark -- only English subtitles. Wouldn't it be lovely to hear it in French or Italian? Or to have a documentary bit with interviews? Voiceover commentary? Storyboards? Surely there must be some record of this film's process.

It's a good price for an awesome film, but I would rather have paid more to have had some lovely bells & whistles.",1011744000,3,840,4.6938775510204085
274349,5,6300250512,"Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) is a beautiful, chaste young woman
who, having been brought up in a conventional upper-middle-class Edwardian home, has led a very sheltered life. So when she goes on holiday to Florence, it is de rigueur that she be accompanied by a much older spinster cousin, Miss Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith), to act as chaperone and protect her from the wicked ways of the world and the evil designs of men. Miss Bartlett is prim and prudish and takes her responsibilities very seriously. Imagine her horror, therefore, when she finds sitting opposite to herself and Lucy at the communal dining table in the pension Bertolini a father and son of doubtful respectability. The father, Mr Emerson (Denholm Elliot), is a retired left-wing journalist and truth-telling eccentric, the son, George (Julien Sands), a handsome clerk on the Railway. She is particularly put off by the father who is forward and speaks with a vulgar accent, and who when Miss Bartlett complains that they have a room without a view has the audacity to offer his own in exchange. How dare he! ""He was only trying to be kind."" Lucy tells her cousin later and eventually with the help of Rev Beebe (Simon Callow), an easy-going fun-loving parson, who they have known from way back and who just happens to be staying in the same pension (this tale is full of coincidences) she relents.
Having been allowed to go for a walk one day in the company of a Miss Lavish (Judi Dench), a garrulous romantic novelist, she suddenly finds herself abandoned in one of Florence's huge squares, and is horror-struck to witness a murder - one young, passionate Italian killing another. She promptly faints, but is caught before she hits the ground by George, who suddenly appears from nowhere. He carries her away and, when she recovers, they talk - a little. He tells her that something tremendous has happened to him, but she pretends not to understand. In truth she is frightened, frightened of him, of what the future might hold and of being swept out of her comfortable, safe existence by this impetuous person with his free and open attitude to life.
Later when all the occupants of the pension Bertolini go on an outing into the countryside, Lucy, managing to escape for a moment from her vigilant cousin,
comes across him standing alone in a field of poppies. Seeing her, he strides towards her and without a word being spoken takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately. But sadly, at that moment Charlotte appears, and, aghast, hurries her a way. And on the following day, only midway through their holiday, they leave for England.
Lucy has a naturally warm, passionate nature that has been extremely repressed by her upbringing. Mr Beebe is the first to recognise this when hearing her play Beethoven's Opus 111 one of the most difficult in the repertoire. He says to her, ""If you ever take to live as you play it will be exciting."" And yet, thinking she will never see George again, the first thing she does on her return to England is to get engaged to Cecil Vyse
(Daniel Day-Lewis) a stiff and stilted, narrow intellectual - though with a streak of dignity. Lucy has written to two dear old sisters who she met at the Pension Bertolini to ask them to come for a holiday and rent a villa just up the road from her. But Cecil, revealing something of his character, plays a trick. Happening to be in the National Gallery one day, he meets Mr Emerson and George (yet another coincidence) and, hearing that they are looking for somewhere to live, brings about his own downfall by inviting them to rent the villa that Lucy has marked down for the sisters. When she hears this Lucy is angry, and begins to think that Cecil will not make an ideal husband. And she notices that he refuses to take part in anything. When asked to join in a game of tennis he says ""There are chaps that are not good for anything but books. I plead guilty to being one of those chaps"" And she says to him, "" When I think of you, I always think of you in a room, never in the open air."" And later, when she is breaking off their engagement, ""You are the sort that can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman.""
But, nevertheless, until almost the very end of the film she deceives herself into thinking she doesn't love George, because, presumably, he is deemed by her family to be beneath them socially. But old Mr Emerson finally convinces her; ""Dear girl,"" he says to her, ""marry my boy. When I think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love - marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made."" The image that stays in the mind is the gleeful, smiling face of Lucy as she chases her mother's carriage after having just decided to marry George.
This film is a finely honed piece of work, correct in every possible detail. A lot of careful work must have gone into the casting and I can't imagine a cast more perfect. But I must just mention the brilliance of the late Denhom Elliot, who makes his Mr Emerson so very lovable, with his simple wisdom and his permanently pained and anxious expression. What a loss he is to the profession. And within its limitations this film is so marvelously true to the book. You just have to turn a blind eye to the many coincidences.",1008460800,5,5279,4.569620253164557

After reading it several times over and discovering the existence of a movie version, I decided to take a chance and watch it.  It wasn't quite what I had expected...  a film full of almost-but-not-quites.  The actress playing Lucy didn't show enough of the internal ""muddle"" that Lucy struggles with in the book...  it seems almost as if Lucy has figured herself out by the time she reaches the Pensione in Italy at the beginning of the movie -- and if that is the case, there is almost no point to the book.  She acts too obviously... a little more subtleness would be great.  And then, of course, there is the first kiss which SHOULD be in a field of violets (I was dying to see that, and they screwed it up!) and the whole gratuitous nudity of the swim in the Sacred Lake.

Wodehouse once admitted that his little comedies existed in a sort of post-Edwardian never, never land where evil couldn't get much further than occasional outbreaks of bad manners. Much the same might be said of E. M. Forster's little Edwardian universe that is explored in this film. A pretty, intelligent, but inexperienced girl finds herself in the incredible beauty of Florence and the spectacular Tuscan summer. She meets a young man who somehow, despite hardly ever saying anything, manages to be the distillation of the Romantic. He falls in love with her and gives her one of the great leaves-you-tingling-all-over kisses in all the movies. She reacts by retreating at full speed into an engagement to the dullest man in the English-speaking world. But, even without Jeeves, things come out right in the end. Even the minor characters are brilliantly cast and performed. The sound track with, I think, Kiri Te Kanawa is enough to levitate the furniture. I wish I could remember who said, ""There's a better universe next door -- let's go!"" He must have been taking about this one!",998956800,11,1094,4.951086956521739

Wonderful locations of Florence cathedral, Palazzo Vecchio, sculpture by Donatello, and an assortment of landscapes are stunning.  Helena Bonham-Carter's casting as the virginal heiress, with Maggie Smith as her meddling biddy chaperone, Judy Dench a proto-Jackie Collins author, Daniel Day-Lewis as prissy Cecil Vise, and, georgous, naked Julian Sands as George Emerson comprise one outstanding cast.  The soundtrack offering by Dame Kiri Te Kaniwa's rendition of ""O Mio Caro"" takes your breath away.  When Lucy, in a field of poppies and wildflowers, receives the kiss to curl your toes from George Emerson, well, can romatic love get any better?

If you're a fan of the movie and you're wondering if you should get this movie, let me give you one word that should make you click on BUY NOW:  Widescreen.
Only when you've seen a great movie on widescreen and THEN watched it in a Standard format can you truly appreciate how much is lost when you go from Widescreen to the standard ""fit your TV"" aspect ratio. I was so bugged at the lack of widescreen on one movie I recently purchased, that I had to stop watching it. Closeups were too close and the left and right sides of the screen were cut off (and you really do miss a lot when the left and right sides are cut off).
Get this movie because the Widescreen gives you a screen that you either forgot about or didn't even know was there. The picture and sound will naturally be better, but the addition of widescreen over CBS' standard format is like enjoying a big ol' bonus.

Helena Bonham-Carter has the most fabulous hair on the planet- just had to say that. She plays Lucy Honeychurch, a young girl on holiday in Florence with her older cousin Charlotte (Maggie Smith), who is deemed her chaperone (remember those?). When Charlotte meets George Emerson (Julian Sands), her entire being is transformed, and she ends up finding him in ""a field kissed with poppies"" where he promptly and without warning gives her a full throttle kiss (and you can tell, this guy KNOWS how to kiss!). Charlotte happens to catch them, and promptly drags Lucy away. But as Lucy heads home for England and the security of ""Windy Corner"" (the family's estate), she cannot forgot George Emerson. To remove him from her mind, she agrees to marry Cecil (a VERY scrawny, pre-""Last of the Mohicans"" Daniel Day-Lewis), a stuffy, over-the-top aristocrat who cares mainly for paintings, poetry, and how things look, rather than how they actually are. Lucy's perfectly crafted world comes to a screaming halt when inadvertently, Cecil finds a new tennant for the cottage down the street- you guessed it, George Emerson and his father move in. Where as George is relieved he's found Lucy, she is upset and scared, mainly because she knows how much this incredible man rocks her world and how his presence threatens her resolve and control.

In a similar way, I found myself lamenting the poor quality of this disc. And like other reviewers on this  page, I can't praise this film enough! But I only feel ill will toward the  DVD version.
The video lacks the sharpness of other DVDs. Starting right  from the main titles, the film's exquisite cinematography looks hazy here,  with orange and green halos of color bleeding from pixel to pixel. It is  not anamorphic or enhanced for widescreen televisions. The video was  compressed to fit on a single-layer disc, and appears interlaced.
The  DVD would only play in fits and starts on my Apple iMac DV before  overwhelming the computer entirely. I had never seen the computer choke  like this before, through dozens of other DVDs.
The Dolby sound is good,  but there is no commentary on the disc, no production notes, no trailer, no  second language -- no extras to speak of whatsoever -- and it comes in a  paperboard latch case instead of a glossy keep case. It feels like corners  were cut in every possible way.
This disc seems an insult to the hard  work that talented artists put into ""A Room with a View,"" and the DVD's  makers owe the film's ardent fans an apology.
If you think you want to  buy this DVD, rent it first and see if you don't change your mind. If you  don't already own Sony's ""Howards End"" on DVD, buy that instead -- both  films appeal to a similar audience.
To see how a DVD should be made, try  ""Collectors Edition"" discs from Universal Pictures such as ""Fried Green  Tomatoes"" or ""Field of Dreams."" For scenery of Italy, try ""Much Ado About  Nothing"" from Columbia TriStar and Samuel Goldwyn, or for scenery in  general, try ""A River Runs Through It"" from Columbia Pictures.

Helana Bonham Carter  plays the beautiful Miss Lucy Honeychurch.  Julian Sands--in the only role  I ever liked--other than his Franz Liszt in ""Impromptu""--plays  the philosopher/newsman George Emerson. Denholm Elliott plays his father.  Maggie Smith plays Charlotte Bartlett, Lucy's companion. Judy Dench plays  Miss Lavish, author of novels and Ms. Bartlett's acquaintence who with her  Baedecker takes Miss Bartlett sight-seeing in Florence. The list goes on  and on.
Miss Honeychurch and Miss Bartlett travel to Florence Italy.  They are disappointed when they discover they do not have a room with a  view at their pensione. ""But we specifically requested a view""  says Miss Bartlett. She makes a fuss, much to Miss Honeychurch's  consternation.  The Emerson's kindly and graciously give up their room with  a view (of the Duomo) to the two ladies.
One bright morning, instead  of being out on the piazza with the other travelers, Miss Honeychurch plays  Beetoven madly at the pensione. Lucy's vicar is a member of the travel  party in Florence. The Reverend Mr. Beebe (Simon Callow) hears Lucy playing  and says, ""If only Miss Honeychurch would learn to live the way she  plays.""  Lucy gathers herself up in a peevish mood, and goes to the  piazza. At the piazza, she witnesses a violent scene, loses her composure,  and is rescued by the young Mr. Emerson. He gazes on Lucy fondly and says,  ""Don't you feel it."" ""It"" of course are his feelings of  tenderness and stirrings of love. But Lucy is engaged to Mr. Cecil Vyse and  cannot easily reciprocate.
The countryside around Florence is  intoxicating and the visitors decide a picnic is in order. On the picnic,  Lucy encounters George Emerson in a field strewn with red poppies and tall  grasses--one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed (scored with an  Italian opera and faithful to the book(s)). Once more, she loses her  composure.  Miss Bartlett sees her with George and intervenes. The ladies  return to England to Miss Lucy's home. By coincidence, Mr. Emerson Sr.  takes a lease on a house in the local village.  George visits him on  weekends. ""Fate"" --says George Emerson when he discovers Lucy  lives nearby.
The rest of the film, Lucy battles George and what she  perceives to be her unacceptable feelings for George. She lies to herself.  She lies to George. She lies to her mother, her brother, Mr. Beebe, and  Cecil Vyse.  Will she finally tell the truth--she loves George and wants to  break her engagement with Cecil?
The film is scrumtous: romantic, funny  and beautifully made. It was nominated for best picture, and several of the  actors were nominated for awards. It faithfully recaptures E. M. Forster's  book.  You will want to read the book, and it doesn't matter if you read it  before or after the film because they are almost identical.  Forster also  wrote ""Howard's End"", ""Passage to India"" and  ""Maurice"" -- all wonderful stories from the Edwardian period and  developed into Merchant and Ivory films with exacting verismilitude.
This is a happy film. This is a very funny film. The scene where the men  go for a ""bath"" at the local pond (skinny dipping) is absolutely  hysterical. If you love Italy, you will want to see this film just for the  sights in and around Florence.  Ms. Smith and Ms. Dench are fabulous  together.  Buy the DVD. Buy the book. This is one of the best you'll ever  see/read.",961977600,2,3643,4.8980263157894735
274421,5,6300250512,"I remember seeing this when I was about 14 or 15 and I just had to go back and see it again and again.  This is the story of Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter), a proper young lady who travels to Italy with her chaperon  Charlotte (Maggie Smith).  Once there, Lucy meets and falls in love with  George (Julian Sands) who is everything poor Lucy, with her repressed  upbringing, is not.
However, when Charlotte catches them kissing (in a  breathtaking scene) the spell is broken.  BVack in England, Lucy is set to  marry Cecil Vyse (an irrecognizable Daniel Day Lewis) who embodies the term  ""pompous prig"".  George makes his way back to Lucy's life but  first Lucy must deal with Cecil and Charlotte in order to find happiness  with George.
Love the lovely movie, if you're looking for a love story to  take you away, this is it.  Watch also for a hilarious appearance by Judi  Dench as an annoying writer who writes Lucy and George's kiss into her  silly novel.",961545600,19,967,4.567251461988304
274442,5,6300250512,"There is no doubt that the Merchant/Ivory/Jhabvala film, ""A Room with a View,"" sets out to take a close look at English social mores around the turn of the century, but fortunately it also offers us a delightful  scenario, with strong performances from an interesting cast. The English,  it seems, are never happier than when they are playing at being themselves.
Some may find the opening scenes rather tedious, since we are just being  introduced to this stilted post-Victorian society and, for the first  half-hour, the character of the chaperone has the upper hand. I thoroughly  enjoyed this beginning; the social exchanges taking place at the Pensione  Bertolini were full of subtleties and one could sense, from the presence of  Miss Bonham-Carter, the leading lady, that the slowness wasn't going to  last. Just as we were beginning to get exasperated, so was she. From then  on, exit the chaperone, and enter the scalding beauty whose story this is.
Set in bustling Florence and then the English countryside, the film  gives us a privileged look into English society (was this the intention of  E. M. Forster, the novelist, I wonder) as it carefully nurtures the last  niceties of the age. Hints are broadly given that this is a film about  breaking out of those very conventions into which the English seem to find  themselves helplessly trapped; several of the characters are trying, but  not very hard, to keep up appearances. As for the main character, she is  obliged to break with convention as hard-headedly as she can, in order to  find the happiness that, we the viewers, are led to suspect is but a mere  heartbeat away.
It is a movie that must have been wonderful on the big  screen; the photography is sometimes epic in nature and the decor is  invariably rich. Still, by turning the volume up so you don't miss some of  the finer points of the dialogue, you will enjoy what is an entirely  satisfying piece of cinema, on the television, I'm sure.",957744000,4,1968,4.794642857142857
274443,5,6300250512,"This is on my Top 5 best movies of all time list.  Words cannot begin to describe it.  The acting (Helena Bonham Carter IS Lucy as Forster must have envisioned her), story, photography, music, direction, costumes and everything about it leaves me breathless.  I've been to Florence and it  makes me smile every time I watch the movie (which I've done hundreds of  times) when I remember walking those same streets and piazzas and treading  those same blossom covered hills.  There are insufficient superlatives to  describe it. Words fail me - the movie is simply sublime.  One thing I have  to ask is, why has this movie not been released on DVD.  It is absolutely  crying out to be seen in this format.  I also have an old ex-rental copy  which is almost worn out. It was already well watched when I bought it.  Obviously a very popular movie.  I'm told it ran for 18 straight months in  cinemas in Sydney when it was released.  I adore it.  It makes me yearn to  do the Victorian Grand Tour myself, not the rushed version I did in the  70s.  Next year perhaps.  Lastly, reviewers have criticised its pace.  This  is not True Lies - it is a movie whose every moment must be savoured.  It  deserves nothing less.",954806400,13,1213,4.470046082949309
274444,5,6300250512,"This is the best movie adaptation of any book that I have ever seen. It was made with a grace and accuracy that movies adapted after books today has not captured.

Period.  *ALL* the actors and their performances are *PERFECT*.  Unlike some  previous reviewers who have had the great fortune of traveling to Florence  and experiencing the beauty of the Italian 'scena' for themselves, I and my  best friend, on other other hand, literally *accidentally* strolled into  the English village where much of the rest of the film took place.  Imagine  our initial, eerie feeling of deja-vu (""Gosh, have we been here  before?""), and then the sudden realization that we had walked right  into into ""A ROOM WITH A VIEW""!  It was glorious; we even had  lunch across from the Rev. Beeb's church.  It was one of the most beautiful  days of my life.",947808000,5,808,4.746376811594203

274448,5,6300250512,"I've enjoyed this movie more each time I've seen it. As a filming of my favourite novel I was a bit bothered at first by the differences from the book. I missed the violets. I suppose they couldn't find a bank of violets  for the scene of the kiss, the climax of the book, which perhaps is  unfilmable as written. But really the movie is very faithful to the book.  Visually it is wonderful, and all the performances are great, especially  Daniel Day-Lewis who is Cecil to the life.
By the way, the opening  situation is taken from real life. There was and is a real Pensione in  Florence on the banks of the Arno where two people checked in around the  turn of the century. The chaperone figure was Forster's mother, and the  young person was Forster himself. And Forster like Lucy was a good  pianist... so Lucy IS Forster! Unfortunately Forster didn't escape from his  mother as easily as Lucy got away from Miss Bartlett...",945388800,5,927,4.497005988023952
274449,5,6300250512,"Beautiful is really the only word to describe this film.  I saw this film in 1988 and have seen it countless times since.  I have read the book and it is tremendously faithful to it as only Merchant/Ivory can do.  Lucy is  curious and naive whilst George is haunting and muddled, exactly how I felt  at the time.  I travelled to Florence shortly after seeing the film and  stayed in the pensione where it was filmed, it was like being in the movie  - nothing much had changed.  Incidentally, my room had the view of The  Arno.  The view promised to Lucy by the cockney signora!",945302400,2,577,4.349056603773585

But Helena is only one of the reasons this film is a winner.  Lavish scenery, terrific  character development, and true chemistry between Bonham Carter and Ivory  make this a movie to remember.

Just the Daniel Day-Lewis scenes would worth the price of admission, but all of these actors just absolutely kill it.

7807128,3,6300250512,"This is a movie based on an E. M. Forster novel. Like all movies based on novels, it is a necessary compression of teh novel. There is just not enough time in two hours of drama to contain the contents of a novel. There can only be the hope that the movie will illustrate and be true to the themes of the novel. This can be difficult because the literary novel can examine both the exterior and the interior of its character's actions and motives, their fears and hopes. I had that feeling when watching this movie that the filmmaker found difficulty in the necessary compression. The movie seemed spotty at times with some characters seeming to be shoehorned in. The Cockney Signora is one example while even the Miss Alan's who do play a thematic role are given only a very short appearance.

The movie as a stand alone work of art separate from the novel is rather conventional. it is a bit of social commentary on the liberation from stifling social conventions. I wish that there had been more of an examination of what these social conventions provide rather than just showing them as examples of priggishness and timidity.",1518912000,,1129,4.616915422885572
