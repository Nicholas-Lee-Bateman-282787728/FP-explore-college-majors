2225330,5,B0007OYZ2S,I consider Roy Rogers the most honorable and wonderful man who ever lived. I have seen all his movies and was raised on his TV show. He and Dale were the parents I always wanted. His movies are beyond reproach.,1399852800,,210,4.275

2225336,5,B0007OYZ2S,"Saga of Death Valley, 1939 movie

The movie begins with a young boy and girl talking by a stream. Two riders approach Mr. Rogers' ranch, a pistol shot settles a conflict over property claims. A child saw this so he is kidnapped. The older boy arrives to find his dead Dad. Young Jerry rides with Uncle Ed now. A train arrives at the tiny village of Sundown bringing Roy Reynolds, the new owner of the ""Circle R"" ranch, from Wyoming. Ed Tasker owns the water company and provides protection against marauders from across the border. Tasker controls the law, he picked the sheriff. People don't dare speak out against this feudal system. The party at the Reynolds ranch will leave his cattle lightly guarded. Tasker owns the saloon in town. Jerry's gang rustles the cattle. Back at the ranch there is talk about fighting Tasker. One man wants peace at any price. [A comment on world politics?] Gabby and Miss Minnie dance a waltz. Tasker drops by to offer his protection and water. Then a cowboy rides up to tell of the stolen cattle. Miss Ann explains why some of the men won't fight: they are too old or have a family. The people need a leader to stand against Tasker. Roy's cowhands are dissatisfied. A leaflet calls for joining with others for self-protection.

Tasker wants to discover the leader, and put fear into the people again. Riders raid the Meredith ranch and shoot the owner. But they are attacked by a committee of regulators and driven away. Roy catches up to Jerry and they fight, then Roy quits. Tasker wants to keep the pressure on the ranchers. He suddenly add two and two. Gabby brings a warning to Roy. Tasker's men are meeting at the saloon. Did one man see omens of bad luck? Tasker wants to blow up the Sundown Dam, and eliminate his competition. A black cat drops on the table! Roy escapes, and is pursued by Tasker's men. Can they save the Sundown Dam? The opposing forces meet at the dam, Tasker's men are outnumbered and retreat. Tasker and Jerry will flee across the border after gathering up the loot. But Roy surprises them! Tasker tells Roy that Jerry is Tim Rogers, his younger brother. Jerry now remembers this, and has a final conversation with Mr. Tasker. ""Its been a long time, Roy."" There is a song for the ending. ""Dern persnickety women!"" says Gabby. Roy asks Ann ""Happy?"". You can assume these two ranch owners will combine their property holdings soon.

Setting this story in 1905 shouldn't mislead you in its relevance in 1939. Collective security was a topic in the news. Should the ranch owners unite in opposition to their oppressor? Or should they choose peace with an escalating price? The solution of an alliance against aggression seems to work here.",1291507200,2,2700,4.656184486373165
