No.... the main humor is from homophobic, racist, bigoted ""jokes"" that are constant. I think the worst was the scene with the Shar Pei (Chinese breed... get it?) then later she's eaten out by a doberman (naturally voiced by Too $hort) who says her snatch tastes like takeout.

Ugh... and spoiler alert, they do a glory hole and she eats the fake red rocket and he's going ""Owww!"" over and over. But it's not just the jokes that are so racist, but all the dialog is bad... just painfully written.

Don't waste your money... I put my copy up for sale if you really want to see it. But I don't recommend it. Even if you're really perverted and like bestiality and your racist you STILL probably wouldn't like this movie. I'm just not sure what demographic they were going for.

Also, as a furry, the fursuit at the end was really bad v.v really bad...",1429315200,,1034,4.341968911917099

That poor dog (or should I say happy dog?) gets banged and munched on in one scene after the other. You want to think twice before you show this on your birthday party, but my wife and I definitely enjoyed it. Has a lot of funny jokes and references in it.

It's one of those things you didn't know they were out there....
