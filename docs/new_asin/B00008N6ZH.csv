7985641,5,B00008N6ZH,"Why? Because in the Region 1 DVD box set of Season 6 of Buffy, Once More, With Feeling is presented in detail-blurring letterbox format! Grr - aargh! On this British Region 2 DVD, the ep is the way it should be, that is, in anamorphic 16;9 widescreen. If you're equipped for multiregion playback, pop over to amazon.co.uk, and my review of 1 June 2014 will give you further details.",1401667200,,382,4.550724637681159
7985642,3,B00008N6ZH,"'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' first aired on March 10, 1997, and has since become a cult classic television programme that has been adapted into comic-form, novels, video-games and (undeveloped) animation, along with gaining a wide scholarly audience exploring the psychology and impact that the character of slayer Buffy Summers has had on the mass media and on the portrayal of the female action heroine in general.
Distributed in April 2003 within Region 2 territories by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, this single disc DVD release contains the sixth season musical episode 'Once More, With Feeling', that originally aired on UPN in the United States on 6th November 2001.  Since it was first aired, this 48 minute episode has been praised and critiqued by fans and academics alike.  The main plot concerns the summoning of a demon, nicknamed 'Sweet' (played by Hinton Battle), who is summoned to Sunnydale, making the inhabitants want to spontaneously break into song as if they were in a musical, with accompanying dance routines and backing music.  This makes the characters reveal hidden feelings that they have been concealing from each other, notably Buffy's inability to connect with her life following her resurrection, Giles's worry that he is 'standing' in the way of Buffy accepting her adult responsibilities, along with Anya and Xander's marriage angst, Spike's romantic feelings towards Buffy and Tara's frustration at Willow's abuse of magic.
Joss Whedon both wrote and directed the episode, including all musical numbers, having never even approached musical score before, and the result is an amazing, powerfully acted performance from all main and supporting cast members, especially from Amber Benson, Anthony Stewart Head and James Masters, who all had prior daliances with the music industry before.  It's a shame that Joss didn't received the acclaim he deserved from his television contemporaries at the time on the performance of this episode, as his Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Musical Direction was unfairly disregarded from the ballot box.
Regarding special features, this release doesn't have much to bulk it up in terms of anything new especially.  It includes a series of trailers for the various Region 2 DVD and VHS 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' season box-sets, and a brief overview of 'Angel: Season One' and of the main character of 'Dark Angel', starring Jessica Alba, which are both also distributed by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.  The main featurette, which is titled 'Buffy - Inside the Music' is a short vignette on the music that has accompanied the series since it first aired, with interviews by score composer Christophe Beck and others involved with the overall music supervision on the show.  Additionally, there are English subtitles for the hard-of-hearing, which are available for the episode itself, but not for the aforementioned extras.
All in all, even though the material presented here has been previously featured within the respective season box-sets, this single-disc DVD release provides a small, memorable and musical delve into the expanse of the Buffyverse for both the casual fan and the hardened collector alike.",1392508800,,3220,5.339250493096647
7985643,5,B00008N6ZH,"For several seasons we heard the rumors that Joss Whedon was working on a musical episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" but he was being a perfectionist because it had to be just right. Well, ""Once More, With Feeling"" (First aired November 6, 2001) is about as right as you can get, with every song grounded in the characters.  Add to that the fact that the music is pretty good and how can any fan of ""BtVS"" be impressed? How many times did you replay the episode on your VCR before you stopped humming some of those songs? I was humming ""Every single night..."" for at least a week, but only when I was not insisting people should ""Let Me Rest in Peace.""  I had three different CD versions of the musical plus the ""for your consideration"" Emmy videotape of the episode before it came out as part of the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Season Six"" DVD collection.  But if for some reason all you want is just the episode, then this DVD is available.

On patrol one night in a Sunnydale graveyard, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) suddenly starts singing about how she is ""Going Through the Motions"" as she dusts vampires.  The next morning she finds out that she is not the only one who has been suddenly bursting into song (""I've Got A Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together"").  Even the common people are affected (""The Mustard"") and the only people happy with the situation are the two lovebirds, Tara and Willow (""Under Your Spell"").  But the power of the music forces Xander and Anya to be honest to each other about their fears regarding their upcoming nuptials (""I'll Never Tell"") and it does not help Marti Noxon (""The Parking Ticket"").  Spike is also brutally honest with Buffy in his song (""Rest in Peace""), while something Dawn leads Tara to discover that she has been under Willow's spell in more than one way.

Dawn is left out of the song (""Dawn's Lament"") but not the dance part of the festivities (""Dawn's Ballet"") and meets Sweet (guest star Hinton Battle), the demon behind the music (""What You Feel""), who reveals his plans: marry Dawn and let the Slayer dance herself to death.  Meanwhile, Giles comes to the conclusion that he is just ""Standing"" in the way of Buffy growing up and both he and Tara decide the time has come to leave (""Under Your Spell/Standing - Reprise"").  So Buffy is sent off to fight Sweet alone, but of course everybody shows up to lend a hand (""Walk Through the Fire"").  There they learn the horrible truth, that they did not save Buffy from a hell dimension but instead ripped her from the eternal bliss of heaven (""Something to Sing About"").  It is Spike who saves her from the demon and the ending is rather anticlimactic when they discover it was not Dawn who summoned the demon but Xander, worried about his future with Anya.  The deal is off (""What You Feel - Reprise"") and the gang is left to ask the musical question, ""Where Do We Go From Here?""

We all knew Anthony Stewart Head could sing from his acoustic versions of ""Green Eyes"" and ""Freebird"" (plus ""The Exposition Song""), but Amber Benson certainly does a very nice job with both her big number and the reprise, and you have to give Sarah Michelle Gellar points for giving it her best when you know this is not something she is comfortable doing before the entire world. But then we are back to giving Joss credit for writing songs that played to the vocal strengths (or lack thereof) for his cast (e.g., Willow's ""most filler"" line in ""Walk Through the Fire"").  That is why Nicholas Brendon is able to do his retro pastiche that is never going to be breakaway pop hit with Emma Caulfield (I love the sound of the crickets chirping before Anya launches into ""Bunnies"").  Of course, I am preaching to the people listening to the choir here because fans of the show know they really pulled it off in this episode, which was finished #44 on the ""TV Guide"" and ""TV Land"" list of the 100 Most Unexpected TV Moments.""

The cover art for this DVD was also used on the videotape sent out by 20th Century Fox/UPN/Mutant Enemy to plug ""Once More, With Feeling"" for the Emmys (as well as on the CD, the script book, and the poster art for the episode).  However, notice that pictures of Spike and Giles have now been added.  Of course, the only nomination the episode received was for Outstanding Music Direction (for Jesse Tobias and Christopher Beck). Oh, and ""Under Your Spell"" was the song they were pushing for Outstanding Music and Lyrics that was passed over.  We all thought that once Joss Whedon was nominated for his script of ""Hush"" the Emmy people had recognized what great work he had been doing in relative obscurity over there on the WB. We figured ""The Body"" would obviously get a nomination, but that did not happen. Then we though ""Once More, With Feeling"" was a no-brainer, but, ironically, it turns out we were right and the people who do Emmy nominations do, in point of fact, have no brains.",1135641600,,4905,4.563781321184511
