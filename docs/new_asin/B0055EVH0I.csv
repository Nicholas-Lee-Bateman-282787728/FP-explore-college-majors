8458198,5,B0055EVH0I,"Rurouni Kenshin was a fantastic series that left just about everyone pining for more back when it came out, only to be disappointed when they came out with the Samurai X solution to end the series.  I'm here to tell you, traditional samurai anime are not dead.  Hakuouki comes in around the same era as the first Samurai X, but on the side of the Shinsengumi.  It also, roughly begins around the same point that the series Peacemaker Kurogane (a similar Shinsengumi anime) left off.  With a rough contrast, Hakuouki shows a darker side of the fight than the ""type A"" split-personality shown in characters like Souji throughout much of Peacemaker.  It's also slightly less graphic than Peacemaker (taking more of the Kenshin side of slicing and dicing, but without the pacifist attitude).  All of the character designs are beautifully done, and lean more towards those of Kenshin.  I give this series extra props for successfully adding a female member to the Shinsengumi without making her a full fledged soldier.  The main driving plot is also very interesting, with lots of humor mixed in, and a love story embedded for good measure. The story is full or twists and turns, so just when you think you're safe or you figured something out, something changes.  If you like a good samurai anime, this is a ""must see.""",1308355200,,1315,4.783185840707965
