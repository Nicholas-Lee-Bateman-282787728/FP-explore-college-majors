8020586,5,B00022K9W0,"This wonderful episode of Disney magic was beautifully produced. It was made at a time when Disney programs were worth watching and looked forward to every Sunday night on the Wonderful World of Disney. It was made in an era when one could tell the heros from the villians, and neither ever allowed a curse word pass from their lips. The scripts were well written and every camera shot moved smoothly from scene to scene. This Zorro: The Secret Of El Zorro was worth the cost and veiwing time. It's worth owning all the old Zorro series.
It is too bad that Disney no longer produces fine programming any more. It appears it has lost its way and decided to produce rude mediocre programming on and off the small screne. So, turn off the current garbage that is on tv, including the disrepectful Disney line up, and dust off the vcr and push in this Zorro video and enjoy the evening free from trash tv.
You can purchase this tape and other Zorro tapes and dvds on Amazon.",1316563200,,970,4.455056179775281

Thundering hooves and a flashing  sword herald his presence  ... a slashing ""Z"" marks the triumphs! Guy Williams stars as the legendary  masked hero in this classic action-packed adventure from the  original Disney television series!

Don Diego finds himself trapped in an ironic turn of events when a visiting friend, Ricadro del Amo (Richard Anderson) challenges the famous swordsman Zorro to a duel for the hand of a lovely visitor, Anna Maria. Don Diego manages to outwit the love-struck braggart - but only temporarily. A new challenge from the determined Ricardo dramatically sets the stage for a public unmasking of the legendary hero ... and under circumstances that Zorro cannot afford to ignore!",1102896000,5,905,4.960264900662252
