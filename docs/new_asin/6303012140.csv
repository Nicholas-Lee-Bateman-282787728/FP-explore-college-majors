In the year 2032 arch-villain criminal Snipes wakes from a 35-year deep freeze in Cryo-Prision to find a serene, non-violent Los Angeles ready for the taking. Officials are unable to deal with Snipes ['90s style] brutal character and seek revival of an ""old-fashioned-cop"" [Stallone] to fight an ""old-fashioned criminal"".

It's a take on ""A Brave New World,"" and there are a lot of little references to that book in this movie.
The Joy Joy world of mini-tunes and blissful ignorance crack me up! Snipes and Stallone are less than stellar in their roles, but I think Sandra Bullock does a great job with her character.  There are some groan-worthy moments that can easily be looked past if you appreciate the overall entertainment value this movie provides.

 Bad puns, formulaic plot, very macho dialogue and pretty people running around acting mildly retarded for your viewing pleasure.

 Take all of that, throw it in the blender with a remarkably prescient socio/economic cautionary tale and you get Demolition Man.

542140,3,6303012140,"With a movie ""Like This"" the first question is ""Does it hold up?"". and my answer is ""I don't know"". Some of the sci fi ideas as are still strong. They ""Tried"" to make the future something different than the past. A police force in a world you can not own guns or curse. I question why they needed so many polite crossing guards on the pay role. This movie Does put an effort into the story line ideas. But it turns into a corn ball rewatch. Snipes wasn't that cool looking with a tire suite? and he wasn't that badass with his damage. More talk than action. For a future gun it really sucked to hit any real target. Maybe if this movie was redone..they can take notes on the health ledger Joker..that he know that batman alive is better then killing him off..Stallone..he picked very good roles and very sucky roles..This one..rewatching I can't say how I feel about it all..I guess it showed a future ..and what would happen is a low rate thugs that seemed to be unfrozen and disappear or die with ease..and can't aim worth a damn. Might be a good drinking game to this flick..if you can figure what pattern would get you most drunk?",1502323200,,1134,4.35377358490566

542286,4,6303012140,"Marketed as a blood-and-guts Sylvester Stallone actioner, ""Demolition Man"" (1993) did not prepare its target audience for a futuristic sociopolitical satire. The result is one of Stallone's best escapist vehicles  glass-shattering gunplay combined with refreshingly offbeat humor. Sly displays sharp comic timing as he battles wild-and-woolly Wesley Snipes in the sanitized 21st century. A diverse supporting cast includes spirited portrayals from Sandra Bullock, Nigel Hawthorne and Benjamin Bratt. Video artist Marco Brambilla handles the directorial duties with ingenuity and verve. Though ""Demolition Man"" was part of Stallone's mid-1990s comeback, it remains strangely forgotten today.",1492041600,,690,6.340425531914893

W.Snipes is a great villain. His arch-enemy, who I shall not name,got a great laugh line when he finds that Arnold Schwarzenegger  became President in the the future. Otherwise he's just a bulging cephalic vein,with a facial droop,and apparently a target of everyone who can't shoot straight.  I'd have preferred Bruce Willis in that role.

543223,5,6303012140,"This is a very good sci-fi drama with lots of action and humor. Sylvester Stallone is a tough cop in 1996 with a record of being so violent that he leaves a demolished building when he goes in to capture a criminal. Hence he is called the Demolition Man. Wesley Snipes is a psychotic killer with a weird sense of humor. He has no problem killing people. Stallone captures Snipes with not only is the building being demolished but some thirty innocent lives are lost. Both are frozen for their crimes and they are up for parole in 2026. By 2032 that have not been thawed. The female star of the film is addicted to the twentieth century. She is bored with the peace, friendliness, and peacefulness of 2032.
After 36 years, long after the sentence time, Snipes is thawed. We do not know why. He escapes and kills many people in a civilization of peace and time of no guns.
Unable to find anyone else to combat Snipes, Stallone is thawed to go after him.
The result is not only plenty of action, but humor in how Stallone tries to adjust to the twenty-first century of peace.",1436745600,,1072,4.41919191919192

543414,3,6303012140,"Finally saw the Blu-ray version of this underrated 90s popcorn flick last night. Since there have been 1,000 reviews of the 25-year-old Stallone-Snipes-Bullock film already, I won't go into detail on the plot (but I will nit pit a bit later). The Blu-ray transfer is indeed a Blu-ray upgrade; they remastered the film and it looks good. There's not much to the disk; it's the movie and that's all. But if you own an ancient VHS copy or the first-generation disappointment of a DVD (and if you really like the film enough to pony up extra cash for this disk), you'll love what's here.

As for the movie itself, it's fun if you don't take it seriously. The only thing that drives me crazy about this flick is the timeline. The movie was made in 1993. So, we're expected to believe that in three years, crime has gone totally to hell in Los Angeles. Stallone and Snipes are placed into cryogenic sleep for 36 years shortly thereafter. When they awake in 2032 or whatever, the world has become a place where only a handful of people remember what life was like back in the monstrous 20th century. Otherwise, in a mere four decades, cops no longer know how to be cops, guns only exist in museums, people have never heard of toilet paper, sex/""fluid exchanges"" are forbidden, and routine expressions like ""Take this job and shove it"" are completely foreign (and messed up by ""modern"" people who try to use them). This is hard to buy, popcorn flick or not. Think about it: How much do you remember (or know) about the 1970s? If the movie had been set in 2132, or even 2082, this might have seemed believable. Also, ""San Angeles"" apparently is the only bastion of civilization left, as there is no reference to any other place on the planet. Maybe they were saving that info for the sequel. Oh well.",1429401600,3,1791,4.544891640866873

544136,4,6303012140,"Though it is basically just an action movie, it is one of Sylvester Stallone's better projects.  Here, Stallone plays a cop who, after having been confined in a cryogenic prison, wakes up in the future and must face his old nemesis, career criminal Simon Phoenix, played by Wesley Snipes, who is also once again awake and doing what he likes best...causing chaos and leaving dead bodies in his wake.  Aided by future cop Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, played by Sandra Bullock, Stallone navigates this new futuristic society, trying to adapt and also retain the skills he needs to take the madman Phoenix down once and for all.  So, this is an action movie, with over-the-top stunts, clich moments, and corny lines.  But you just can't help but enjoy it.  The lines, especially those in the future, are pretty funny and the tough-guy lines are pretty cool.  ""You'll regret it for the rest of your life...both seconds of it"" is my favorite.  I do wonder what the MPAA thought as they were trying to decide the rating for this film...what with no actual sex happening and profanity being highly discouraged.  I did find the footage of that little girl talking to the reporter a bit weird, but the movie had plenty of weird in one way or another, so I guess that fit right in.  Go ahead and watch it.

-- MK Ultra-programming of an assassin (Simon Phoenix);
-- skull symbols (Skull n Bones);
-- the female lead named Lenina Huxley (a combination of the communist Lenin and fabianist Aldous Huxley);
-- a photo of JFK (murdered by the NWO);
-- nazi and japanese clothing (recalling the NWO conquered nations);
-- genetic engineering;
-- the mayor of San Angeles who delivers death under the guise of security.

Snipes is a wonderfully manic psycho with one-liners and martial arts moves that make him cunning. The oddest thing about this movie is the fact that both the bad guy and the good guy are brought out of cryo-stasis in a world they both quickly agree is flawed. If they hadn't been enemies going in, and one wasn't a mass-murdering maniac, you'd almost think they'd have teamed up and become buddies in this picture.

Sandra Bullock is a pie-eyed young newcomer in this film, with her future-cop innocence coming off as comic in all the right places to annoy Stallone's character.

If you are unfamiliar with Demotion Man the summary of this movie is as follows; Demolition Man is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Marco Brambilla his directorial debut, and starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. The film was released in the United States on October 8, 1993.  The film tells the story of two men--one, an evil crime lord; the other, a risk-taking police officer--who are cryogenically frozen in the year 1996 and reawakened in 2032. Following a massive earthquake in 2010 that destroyed much of Los Angeles, it merged with San Diego to form a planned city called San Angeles in which all crime has seemingly been eliminated from mainstream society.

544472,4,6303012140,"Won't get into writing a plot summary, its been done.  Won't write about the acting, its been done.  This review is strictly based upon the actual quality of the video and audio transfer to Blu Ray.
Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also
dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using.  The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65"" plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.

VIDEO...
  While I do have this film on Standard Def DVD, this is not a side by side comparison.  I was surprised at the quality of the video transfer; it really is excellent.  Skin tones are very natural while the background color gradings lean towards a slight color popping which is clearly done by production design to represent the future culture where this movie is supposed to take place.  There are many darker scenes that do not sacrifice details.  Even hair, often seen as a blurred blob in other films, can be discerned as individual hairs.  Some very nice and deep blacks in many scenes.  While the Mbps rate appeared to average in the mid 20's,( not earth shaking) I saw no noticeable grain, artifacts or dropouts anywhere in the film.  5 stars for the video transfer.

AUDIO...
  I didn't expect much for this film's audio due to its age and a studio's frequent disregard of remastering audio to save some cash. Never the less, the audio was better than I expected.  The lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 presented clear and transparent dialogue set at proper levels relative to background soundtrack and foley fx.  There is some nice panning between the left and right front stage surrounds and the LFE channel does get some work though the bass doesn't go all that deep in the many explosions.  The rear channels are not called into use as they could have been during the many action scenes.  My guess is that, while transcoded to a lossless audio codec, which will always be better than a lossy one, the audio from this film was not remastered to make use of a complete surround theater set up.  The audio is not bad in any way, it is just not as good as it could have been.  3 stars.

EXTRAS....Other than a  trailer and a commentary by the director, there are none.  This is a film that I am sure there were plenty of comedic bloopers and deleted scenes that I would love to have had included.  What a shame.
  The price for this Blu Ray makes for an easy choice.  Glad I received it as a gift.

I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.

544712,5,6303012140,"Demolition Man (1993)
Directed by Marco Brambilla (the great director of the Alicia Silverstone classic kidnapping rom-com Excess Baggage)
Starring Sylvester Stallone (John Spartan), Wesley Snipes (Simon Phoenix) and Sandra Bullock (Lenina Huxley)

Before there was SPEED 2, and ALL ABOUT STEVE Sandra Bullock perfected her ability to portray a character conflicted with autism first in the movie Demolition Man.  In it she is the stuttering eqivilent of a female Hugh Grant, and with all the sexual charisma.  Although Sandra is great, what makes this movie classic is the homoerotic love story between Stallone and Snipes, the dystopic Taco Bell future, and the mystery of the three seashells.

Stallone and Snipes are arch nemesis (is it nemeseeeeees?).  Snipes is frozen.  In the future, which in this case is 1997, we will freeze our criminals.  Great idea by the way.  Stallone doesn't trust this system.  Therefore, he is frozen too.  Therefore, the two main characters are frozen for centuries.  Wow.  Exciting.  Then, not to spoil it, Snipes is defrosted, and Stallone wakes up and goes on a quest to wipe his ass.  Seriously, a lot of time is spent on his wiping his ass with three seashells(?).

Interesting enough the film predicts a world where only Taco Bell exists.  Interesting to see that Taco Bell will survive its beef flavored grissle scandal.

I love this movie, and finally figured out how to use the seashells...  Want to shake my hand?",1373328000,,1459,5.03347280334728

545011,3,6303012140,"Last night my bargain-rack movie was the ""Demolition Man"" DVD staring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. I've been watching Chuck Norris action movies and thought I'd switch action characters. Well, it was a switch, all right. I hadn't watched a Stallone movie since the early 80s. I gave up on them because he was such a bad actor. Well, the acting in this movie is atrocious, but I'd guess it's supposed to be as part of a comedy-like background. Snipes is awful too. Plus the movie is filled with all kinds of jokes and some of them are even kinda funny. Most are lame or low-brow, but, again, it's kind of a humorous overtone this movie is attempting to push, and it's partially successful. I was laughing here and there. Mostly I was groaning. Well, it's hard to take the movie seriously in any way and I was foolish to even try. Even as an action police thriller, it's hard to get wrapped up in the story. Is it an entertaining movie? Yes, I'd say it was, but the entertainment value got to be less and less as he movie progressed and by the end, I was happy to see the closing credits.

The movie takes place in the future, 2032 to be specific. Both Stallone, the aptly-named Demolition Man, and Snipes have been frozen, preserved and then brought back to life in an ultra-moodern Santa Barbara-Los Angeles-San Diego mega-city known as San Angeles, or something like that. The city is really high tech. It has automated graffiti-making machines and automated cleaning-up devices. It's sorta funny on many different levels. Stallone and Snipes continue their late 20th century battles, which consists mainly of indiscriminate gunfire and the destruction of everything in sight and receiving tickets for their abusive language. Lots of tickets. It's not much of a story and wears thin as.the movie progresses. Well, I enjoyed it, sorta. Would I watch it again? No.

Fortunately this is not the case with Demolition Man. There's not much as far as extras, and no special menu, but if all you're looking for is a good clean sharp transfer that really looks Blu-Ray, then you've found it.",1351641600,34,556,4.148148148148148
545135,5,6303012140,"I'd forgotten how good this film is. Sure it's a cop action movie but it is genuinely a Sci Fi movie as well. It's claimed one of the definitions of science fiction is that somehow the events taking place effect all of us, everyone on Earth. It's a menace, a disease, a threat, that can kill us all or at least have major consequences. Perhaps this film explores an ideology that threatens us all. . . more correctly this film explores another definition Sci Fi, some kind of change to society. This isn't a children's story or action movie that happens to take place in space or in the future, with people exactly like us. In Demolition Man the population of San Angeles believe and act in completely different ways than we do. Demolition Man stresses how differently they behave.

In 2032 it appears there's no crime, no violence, and no foul language or littering. We don't see those who rebel against this conditioning until late in the movie. At one point in the film Sandra Bullock and her cop partner listen to the radio - the only thing airing are commercials. They happily sing along to the advertising jingles. For the most part, however, the film makers stack the deck by making this look like a better world than the one we live in. This is some kind of 'conservative' movie, I think.

It seems like they took care not to stereotype the villain, Simon Phoenix. He's like a fay, happy, psychopath. He makes no pretenses to be macho, that's for sure. Simon Phoenix takes not caring to a new level. Most likely a coincidence but Wesley Snipes channels a bit of the Joker from the old Batman TV show.

Sylvester Stallone plays the cop John Spartan but anyone could have played him. I think the villain in the film had to be a black actor. Later in the film the mayor of San Angeles tells Simon Phoenix, ""People are scared of you"". Simon Phoenix replies, as if he's hardly paying attention - and sounding a bit like the character Elmo from the Muppets, ""eh people have always been scared of me"", The mayor replies with emphasis, ""Yes but now they are really terrified of you"", ""Now we can create a society with order the likes of which has never been seen"". When do they just come out and tell you their evil plan? Outside a Hulu commercial, when does power speak truth - when do they come out and just tell you their plan right in your face?

I'd reviewed this before on another site and noted this part of the film is odd in a way. In a society where there's no crime - when a call comes in for 187, the famous call number for murder, no one on the police force even knows what it means - in a society where there's no crime, littering or even foul language, why would they need to restore order? The actor who plays the police chief for San Angeles steps out of character a bit. He plays a tough guy almost. He still doesn't know what the police code 187 stands for but he sort of becomes the cliche of the police chief who tangles with the top cop who's the star of the movie.

I felt this was a good film and did a good job showing citizens of San Angeles acting quite a bit different than we do. They kept repeating the same kind of joke over and over in the film, however. The first couple of times it was very funny. After a while it stopped being funny.",1350777600,2,3269,4.32626427406199

This was a high budget sci fi  movie that is one of the silliest movies of snipes career. although his career these days is straight to dvd films which are low budget. The film features stallone going after escaped cryogenically frozen criminals. Jeffery dahmer (the milwaukee cannibal who ate many young men) is even mentioned and he killed in prison right before this one came out.  However there are some of the silliest lines in history as sandra bullock has to say with a straight face to slys character , 'all the resteraunts are taco bells now!""  really?  taco bell must have financed this movie completely! lol. Anyways it is a over the top b movie type plot with alot of money to make it look great. (for autdiences in 1993 especially and that's what counts with older movies , not how they look to todays dvd watchers!). this is silly and is probably on many critics worst of lists.

545178,4,6303012140,"Demolition Man(released Oct./93)stars Wesley Snipes as killer extreme Simon Phoenix and Sylvester Stallone as Sgt. John Spartan of the LAPD.The movie is a rollicking good ride,with a very good blend of intense action mixed with a good sense of humour.
The plot takes place in a slightly futuristic LA,and it has Stallone as a no nonsense LAPD officer trying to capture the notorious killer Snipes. The confrontation ends in a warehouse,but Snipes won't come clean as to the whereabouts of some hostages. The building is rigged to explode as Stallone barely makes it out alive with Snipes on his shoulder. Post explosion other officers discover the remains of the hostages and Stallone is charged,put on trial and sentenced to cryogenic freezing,the punishment of choice in this world.
In 2032 Snipes,who has been refrozen for his crimes,is thawed for his parole hearing. Society has become awash in political correctness and pacifism during this time and there has been a slowly  building underground movement led by one Edgar Friendly(Denis Leary)to turn things back. The leader responsible for this new society is Dr. Cocteau(Nigel Hawthorn)and he has been unable to rid LA of pest,Friendly. To this end,and unknown to the parole board,he has enhanced Snipes abilities for killing to even more extremes,in order to help him rid Los Angeles of the underground movement. Snipes,while sitting strapped into his chair at his hearing ,suddenly becomes loose and ends up escaping the facility.
Snipes goes on a killing spree but the ineffectual LAPD are unable to mobilize,as they do not have the capabilities of handling such a criminal. The police chief comes up with the idea of unfreezing Stallone in the hopes this old bad-butt can lasso this varmint and return him to the cryo chamber.
Re-animated Stallone is a fish out of water. Every time he swears he is fined,as he is as far from the current societal state as he can be. To assist him in this new environment is Lt. Huxley(Sandra Bullock),who just happens to be into old pop culture. She trails Stallone around as he picks up Snipes trail. But Stallone is soon piecing the puzzle together that there is more behind Snipes release than meets the eye and Cocteau is connected to it. Stallone finds a manhole cover and descends into the underground of LA only to find an entire counter society that only wants equality and proper food to eat. He meets Friendly and instead of arresting him he is sympathetic. Suddenly shots spray the area they stand in,as Snipes and some followers also have found Friendly and his group. Snipes escapes with Stallone in hot pursuit.
A car chase ensues and the two end up back at the cryo facilities for the final showdown. Stallone learns from the maniac that the hostages,those many years ago,were already dead before the explosion occurred. So Stallone was sent up for something he didn't do. Snipes gets frozen again but decapped by Stallone. The facility is totally destroyed as the police chief wonders how they are ever going to get along. Stallone suggests they reach a compromise with Friendly and his myriad of followers,to reach an amicable solution.
This film is chock full of adrenaline pumping moments,especially when its two stars go head to head. Stallone is the intense cop while Snipes is the perfect over the edge psycho criminal. Bullock,as Stallone's sidekick,offers up some good funny moments as she gets old sayings screwed up and makes plenty of faux pauxs where Stallone is concerned. Rob Schneider is also on hand as one of the cops with his""He doesn't know how to use the sea shells"".How DO you use those darn sea shells?
Technically the film is in is in its original a/r of 1:77:1 and looks clear and crisp throughout. There are really no extras other than commentary.
In conclusion,yes this IS a good movie,no two ways about it. Stallone and Snipes offer up the goods and worked well together in this futuristic good vs evil flick. Recommended.",1343001600,,3960,4.937031484257871

  John Spartan aka Demolition Man(Stallone) is on the hunt to track down Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) and save hostages. Phoenix is captured but the hostages all die. Spartan is to blame for not being able to rescue them. Spartan and Phoenix are arrested and frozen to have their sentences. 40 years have passed and Phoenix has been taken out into the real world to cause havoc and to assassinate a threat which is a rebel Edgar Friendly (Leary).In the short time that Phoenix has been out he has already caused murder and chaos. Police of the future are now very intimidated and awaken John Spartan to once again arrest and kill Simon Phoenix.

  This is Sly's first scifi action movie followed by Judge Dredd years later. Wesley is having fun being Phoenix and is not your typical coldblooded killer. He has humor in him. Lots of funny scenes of how the future in California is portrayed and it has become the city of San Angeles. Swearing,red meat,bonding,is a nono and lots of technology that is similar to the one in real life today. Good action futuristic flick with guns,weapons from old and futuristic.

Demolition Man defies this by swinging the pendulum completely the opposite direction and pitting classic action archetypes against each other in a utopic future setting instead of the prosaic dystopic one.

A Dictator has arisen and brought about a new, Peaceful, orderly world...by driving the ""lower element"" underground. Sly and Wesley and Sandra Bullock shake, rattle, and roll in both worlds...and in both centuries - Bullock has studied the ancient past and is able to work with Stallone, as she understands his ""primitive"" culture.

If that's too ""out there"", just enjoy the incredible special effects, the tight editing, the musical score. We look into the (not so distant) future... and see alot that does not seem so remote: the ""freedom"" of the above ground society comes at a great price - be subjugated by the powers that be and live clean, healthy...and not much more. The have-nots have no meaning in the new order.

Watch for special cameo by Jesse The Body Ventura just before he became Jesse The Governor Ventura. And listen for a moderately portentuous mention of Arnold Schwartzenegger.

The film never quite makes up its' mind if it's action-adventure or satire; that enhances its' presumptive ""cult"" status.

Supposedly, it's a hip way of mishandling a gun?).  The `quips' are forced, the overall humor lame.  At this point Sylvester only did one character, repeatedly.  Snipes cackles a bad impression of Cesar Romero's Joker, and the only `performance' that made me cringe more than Sandra Bullock's was Benjamin Bratt's wide-eyed ninny.  Why do people always overcompensate when trying to approximate innocence?  Why are cackling villains so prevalent in the movies?
It's sad when you have to admit the most realistic performance in this film belonged to Denis Leary.

Its tongue-in-cheek predictions for the state of society in the year 2032 are so genuinely stupid that I felt like an idiot for laughing, but laugh I did - and often. These punchlines are plainly lowbrow, such a direct contrast to the straight manner in which Stallone plays his leading role that I wasn't entirely sure everyone on the cast was in on the joke. The plot, too, is unfailingly moronic, even by action film standards, and may have benefitted from a more distant date stamp. When the opening scene designates Los Angeles in 1996 as a criminal's safe haven, complete with a flame-licked Hollywood sign, you should know you're in for a long ride - and it only gets rockier from there. Wesley Snipes plays a joyously schizophrenic foil, part Joker and part Batman, but the picture never advances far enough beyond its one-note premise to really take advantage of it.",1308787200,2,1103,4.872340425531915

545366,4,6303012140,"In the far-away future of 1996, Los Angeles has been turned into a demilitarized zone, and one-man-army cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), nicknamed ""Demolition Man"" because massive property damage seems to accompany him wherever he goes, is out to capture crime lord Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) after he has kidnapped a bus filled with passengers. Spartan infiltrates Phoenix's hideout and captures him, but Phoenix has rigged the building to explode, and both cop and criminal barely make it out alive. However, it appears that the bus passengers have died in the explosion. Charged with involuntary manslaughter, Spartan is sentenced to 70 years frozen in stasis in a ""cryoprison.""

Fast forward to the year 2032, where Los Angeles is now the utopian San Angeles. Unhealthy behavior and profanity have been outlawed, violent behavior has become a thing of the past, and not a single person has died of unnatural causes in nearly 20 years. Thus, the San Angeles Police Department has been reduced to glorified meter maids. Amid the boring peace she lives in, Officer Lenina Huxley (a young, and very cute Sandra Bullock) opines, ""What I would give for some action!"" Be careful what you wish for, Lenina.

Phoenix, who has also been frozen in stasis in the cryoprison, is given a parole hearing. But Phoenix escapes and kills everyone in his path, and is now capable of deadly martial arts and possess knowledge of the futuristic technology he has never even encountered before, a fact that even puzzles himself. Now Phoenix is deadlier than ever, and the SAPD are completely unprepared to deal with the threat. Believing that ""you need an old-fashioned cop to catch an old-fashioned criminal"", they thaw out John Spartan and reinstate him in the SAPD to hunt Phoenix. In a future world they are unfamiliar with, the two foes clash once again.

Though Demolition Man comes in a wrapper of a cliched action film, it is comparatively deeper than your typical action vehicle. Unlike other films set in the future like Escape from New York which seem to take their inspiration from dystopian literature like George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, which imagine a future where morality and order is forced upon its citizens through totalitarian rule, Demolition Man pays homage to Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World by envisioning a world where people have willingly and happily sacrificed their freedoms in exchange for peace and safety. Several characters in the film are homages to the novel, as Lenina Huxley gets her name from the the book's author and one of its main characters, and John Spartan was inspired by another ""fish out of water"" character from the book, John the Savage, and other characters also refer to Spartan as a savage. Simon Phoenix even references the book's title during a fight scene with Spartan.

The film also addresses issues like ethics and morality, and touches on the issue of manipulating bahavior, a subject that another futuristic work, A Clockwork Orange, delves into. Demolition Man also seems to reference H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, where society is mainly divided between two classes, the leisured, frivolous citizens living above ground and the savage ""Morlocks"" (they are referred to as ""Scraps"" in Demolition Man) who live underground.

As for the performances, Stallone plays Spartan as a foulmouthed, frustrated outsider, bewildered by the changes the world has gone through. Sandra Bullock's Lenina Huxley is exuberant, naive, and perky. And Snipe's Simon Phoenix may be one of the scariest, most fun villains ever committed to celluloid. It's strangely enjoyable to watch Phoenix toy with his opponents like a cat with a wounded mouse, as Snipes seems to be having the most fun with the role. Other notable performances include Benjamin Bratt, who plays his role as a fellow SAPD officer with schoolboy earnestness, Nigel Hawthorne as the arrogant patriarch of San Angeles, Raymond Cocteau, and Denis Leary as fast-talking leader of a rebel group that is quite literally underground.

Filled with action, humor, and social commentary, Demolition Man is one of those rare films that excedes beyond a genre that is overwrought with cliches and conventions.",1278288000,,4207,5.134306569343066

The film begins with a burning Los Angeles in 1996. A bus has been hijacked. John Spartan lands to shoot down the bad guys and catch Simon Phoenix. But the thirty hostages are gone. Spartan is sentenced to Cryoprison for seventy years. Next it is 2032 and we see life in the future. Simon Phoenix attends his parole hearing, then escapes from prison. How was he captured? By ""old-fashioned cop"" John Spartan, who is needed again. Can a peace-loving society be threatened by a ""cave man""? Is anger and violence part of human nature? Can it be suppressed by drugs? ""They're out of toilet paper."" People have microchips embedded in their bodies so they can be traced and controlled. [Better than cell phones?] ""You drive."" There is trouble at the museum. Lt. Lanina Huxley will guide Spartan in this brave new world order. The action has plenty of special effects. Who freed Phoenix? What was the purpose?

Doctor Cocteau created this peaceful society. The Franchise Wars left society with a monopoly food vendor. ""Salt is illegal."" What would happen if the ""Scraps"" were unleashed upon society? [Do you get the subtle humor?] We learn that Phoenix is to kill Edgar Friendly, a leader of the resistance. Can Spartan have sex with Huxley when no touching is allowed? ""Breaking the law?"" The computer implants knowledge for rehabilitation. Who trained Phoenix? Will Spartan be returned to cold storage? Will they go underground to the lower depths? ""Don't ask where the meat comes from."" Are people who think for themselves dangerous? We meet Edgar Friendly, they left the underground to raid the food warehouses to find something to eat.

Phoenix gathers a crew to bring back the good old days. There is plenty of action after Spartan and Friendly are ambushed. Can an antique Olds 442 be used in an exciting car chase? [No action film is complete without one.] Will there be a problem in a drive-by-wire car? ""Take this job and shovel it."" Doctor Cocteau wanted to frighten people with a dangerous terrorist to he could get absolute power. [It can't happen here?] Will his plan go awry? Lt. Huxley impresses Spartan: ""Jackie Chan movies"". Can Spartan stop the defrosting? Shots are fired as if they have an inexhaustible supply of old ammunition. The special effects are impressive. [No CGI?] The battle goes on until Phoenix cools off. ""How will we live?"" There is a happy ending for the people of San Angeles. ""How do the three sea shells work?""

Machiavelli warned against the use of paid mercenaries because they can capture the government that hired them. Only a militia of citizen-soldiers are proper to a republic.

Simon Phoenix is one of the worst criminals that Los Angeles has ever seen, and only one man can stop him - L.A.P.D. officer John ""Demotion Man"" Spartan. When John apprehended Phoenix, he was surprisingly found as an accessory to the recent crime and was also sent to the ""Cryo Prison"". During John Spartan's sentence, Los Angeles' theme and society had dramatically changed from one of violence to one of peace. Phoenix, revived for a parole hearing managed to escape and uses Los Angles to his advantage. The Police are unable to stop him with their non-violent solutions and have no choice but to let out John Spartan to stop him. Now, Spartan not only has to stop Phoenix, but to adapt himself to the future society he has no knowledge about. The humor in the movie is exceptional, and Wesley Snipes is great as Simon Phoenix.

That is, until Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), 20th century mega-criminal and all-around bad guy is defrosted from the cryogenic prison and goes on a rampage. The peace loving futurites can't cope with the situation, so resort to defrosting John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), the man who originally captured Phoenix but who was also arrested for killing over 30 civilians in the process.

""Demolition Man"" is an enjoyable film that had the potential to be better. With Daniel Waters (who also wrote ""Heathers"" and ""Batman Returns"") as one of the script writers, the script does have moments of his trademark black humour, but not enough to hide the fact that this is a typical, big-budget studio action film. The cast of the film is incredible and includes, among others, Stallone, Snipes, Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Nigel Hawthorne, Rob Schneider and Denis Leary, but many of these actors are criminally underused (especially Leary, as the rebel leader, who only appears for about 10 minutes in total). Nevertheless, the vision of a future so perfect that fun has basically been outlawed is interesting and Snipes is in the role of his career, hamming it up as the villain.",1209427200,2,1346,5.090497737556561

545408,4,6303012140,"There is normally a glut of action oriented science fiction movies that come out each summer and it's hard to pick out the good ones from the bad ones. At times I can be as eager as the next guy to just have a fun popcorn movie that doesn't rely on any deep storytelling, but just good old high flying action. Demolition Man, while not deep, still pulls off some detailed storytelling while still keeping that mindless mayhem most action junkies look for. That being said Demolition Man isn't exactly top gun material either, but it is a worthwhile romp into an interesting (if not completely believable) future.

The premise alone is enough to pique my interest. It's a combination fish-out-of-water story and action cop flick. Lets talk about the former since that's where the story comes from. The beauty of fish-out-of-water scripts is seeing the reactions of the fish in question and how they cope with the new world they are in. This movie has a lot of fun with that concept without getting too over the top. It's really entertaining seeing Stallone trying to figure out stuff (especially the three shells incident). The future society is almost campy in how it's done, but it's very polished camp. It is the kind of camp that doesn't come off as camp. Though technically speaking the society in the movie is virtually impossible the way they show it you still can't help but enjoy all the little situations that happen within it.

The characters are really polished... save one. But lets talk about the polished ones first. You have some really talented actors here portraying their characters perfectly. From the starring cast to the supporting cast you get a wonderful ensemble that fits into their respective roles like a glove... save one. That one character Simon Phoenix, which feels way too cartoonish and aloof to fit in as well as the other characters in the movie. Don't get me wrong. Wesley Snipes did a superb job acting the role. It's just the role itself could have used some tweaking. With this kind of tight acting I will have to give props to Brambilla for some excellent directing here. The city design is equally polishes, using just enough future stuff to make it believable. The special effects are good, but keep in mind this being an action movie the explosions do get over the top. The fight scenes are nicely choreographed as well, showing some prowess on Snipes' part. In the end the production values are definitely worthy of high status.

Demolition Man looks a lot like a mindless action movie, and it actually is. Only this one has a little more brains in it than most. It knows how to have fun with its role. If you love action sci-fi with a good dose of comedy then you found your match here. If you like some depth to your storyline as well as action then you too found something here. While it's not high grade science fiction by any means Demolition Man is still a worthwhile jaunt if you crave a lighter diet of sci-fi.",1204070400,3,2962,4.648854961832061

If you curse, you get a ticket violation, no matter where you are.  The outfits that people wear on a typical occasion are more like costume robes.  Physical touch is no longer allowed between partners, and is only done by virtual means instead.  And lastly, the Los Angeles area is now clean and all the suburbs have formed a new city known as San Angeles.  Well, its all just a part of the humor added to this film, which surprisingly is a highly entertaining B action movie, with some of today's above average B movie stars.

While Sly Stallone is our main man and cop hero, Wesley Snipes and Sandra Bullock steal the show too with their abundant screen time.  Snipes is the villain in this movie, and his character is completely opposite than want you would typically see in his most popular films, the Blade series.  Though he is the hero in Blade, it is obvious he has a very dark, villainous side in those films.  But in Demolition Man, he is more like a Dennis Rodman charcater (and looks like him too), who jokes at everything and everyone while either killing them or blowing up the place.  Sandra Bullock is the young cop, who's passion is for nostalgia L.A.  She is the cop who wants something to actually go wrong in this perfect future, and her wish comes true when Simon Phoenix (Snipes) is brought back after about 30 years of cryo-freeze, once again wreaking havoc on the city.  John Spartan (Sly) is brought back to catch him, since he is the only one who knows how to tame a criminal of the past.

This movie has quite a bit of action, and just about everything you could ask for - guns, explosions, car chases, and fist fights.  Its basically Stallone vs Snipes throughout this film, and their presence alone in the action scenes kicks it up a notch compared to most action actors.  Their final fight in the film is less than 2 minutes, but it is fast and hard-hitting and I still enjoyed it quite a bit.  In addition to the action, there is plenty of humor in the film too.  The plot is not extensive, but this kind of movie just doesn't need it.

Demolition Man comes off as very silly at first, but it does have a way of engaging you.  Whether its the humor or the fun characters, action fans might just want to add this to their collection.",1189036800,2,2428,4.423423423423423

The designer and hence Leader of this Santa Barbara - Los Angeles - San Diego megalopolis is annoyed with the hippies and thaws out an old-style psychopath to get rid of them.  The psycho, however, has megalomanical plans of his own.  We are not told what the rest of the United States is like, but it is certainly indicated that this megalopolis is independent, so we can guess that other megalopolises formed to deal with the urban riots of the past and have developed various other totalitarian societies.  Perhaps the more rural States still have some semblance of American democracy.  It would have been nice to have more information on this society of the future, but such appears to have exceeded both the knowledge and the interest of the filmmakers.

Yes, there is the usual action, but it is not as well motivated as when Sly writes part of the script.  (See The Specialist which came out the same year.)  The only other flaw in the action aspect was that the end (the defeat of the bad guy) was too abrupt.

If the Amazon reviewer had watched and listened to the audio commentary, he would have known that even for the Hispanic filmmaker, this is ""political correctness run amok"", not a picture of a ""conservative"" society, as the Amazonian so naively remarks.

Its definitely one of those movies I catch myself watching whenever it comes on tv.  Sylvester Stallone was terrific as ""no bull"" hero,.  And Snipes is very entertaining as the villain.  Wrecking havoc with great one-liners.  I am surprised director Marco Brambilla didn't have many future projects.  I think he would have followed with a number of great action movies.  Anyway, here is the plot.
Its the future, the year 1997 (Be aware, this movie was made in 1992).  prisoners are cryogenically frozen for their time sentence.  During that time, they are all under suspended animation.  John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is the #1 cop and has reputation as the ""Demolition Man"".  Why?, because he will go as far as demolishing a building in order to get the job done.  Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) is the world most psychotic criminal.  Spartan finds himself unjustly prisoned after finally pursuing Phoenix, whom he has been chasing for yrs.  However in the process of catching him, several people were killed.  Spartan and Phoenix are both sentenced to the ""cryoprison""
The movie then forwards to 2032 where the world has now become a much different place.  Sex is outlawed, so are tobacco, alcohol, meat and anything unhealthy.  Cars have auto drive, profanity is illegal.  Guns have now become antics, and crime apparently has become a rare event.  Simon is now about to undergo a parole hearing and surprisingly escapes and now continues to create terror and mayhem.  The police quickly realize that they do not know how to handle Simon and realize the only person who can stop Phoenix is John Spartan.  They have him released and team up w/ police officer Lennina Huxley (Sandra Bullock).  As Spartan goes after Phoenix, he finds himself trying to adjust to the new world.  But as he digs through the new world to find him, he learns this new world may not be as nice as it seems.  He learns of its corruptness and that it may have not have been an accident that Phoenix escaped.
With a plot, how could anyone not want to see this film?  However my only real problem with this movie is that it's an Action-Comedy.  A movie like this was not meant to be an action-comedy.  Maybe a few good one liners here or there but that's it.  The comedy in this film is really not that funny and just distracts you from the seriousness of the film.  Simon Phoenix tends to have many goofy habits.  Hell, he's more funny than terrifying.  If Wesley Snipes had been more ""Blade""-like in this movie, I guarantee it would have been one hell of a clash of the titans in the end.  But other than that, its definitely an action film I recommend.",1169856000,,2736,4.716701902748414

Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), a criminal frozen in the 20th Century, escapes in the 21st Century and goes on a crime spree. John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), a top cop also frozen in the 20th Century, is thawed out to catch him. Police Lt Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is assigned as cop John Spartan's Chaparone.

Sandra Bullock does a good job playing a polite eager lady of the 21st Century. She has an interest in the 20th Century so she's quicker to recognize violence or intimidation than her cop peers, even doing a karate move, which she laters explains come from, ""watching a Jackie Chan movie"". She's playing a nice girl who carries a big stick I guess. Later in another movie, 'Miss Congeniality', Bullock would play a tough cop, undercover as a nice beauty contestant. Sandra Bullock has a nice performance in Demolition Man. Bullock is this movie. This is a SF movie tho, where everything that is up is down, and where sometimes movie makers seem to comment on apparently taboo issues of the present. Bullock received only a 'Razzie' award for her role here.

It turns out, the head honcho in the 21st Century, Dr Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne), actually released criminal Simon Pheonix on purpose - so he'd cause mayhem and give the goverment an excuse to further control peoples lives (which could seem strange considering there's no crime, littering or violence already). One thing about the future is the same - behind the scenes there's a rich powerful bad guy who is really the cause of all evil. When do the forces of evil just come out and tell you their plan right to your face? In one scene Wesley Snipes character says something like, offhandedly, ""Eh, people have always been afraid of me"". Dr. Cocteau replies with, 'Yes, but now they are really terrified! Now we can build a society of such order that has never been seen before . . . '

I was entertained by Demolition Man and probably in love with Sandra Bullock, but, near the very end, I couldn't help but wonder, 'is this what is going on right now'?

545508,4,6303012140,"This is an enormously entertaining film that is slyly intelligent, chock full of action, and quite humorous. The time is the future, 2032 AD. The location is California, and the police just ain't what they used to be, as the future is a sanitized, politically correct world, where only the most benign behavior is the standard by which all live. Even bad language is a no no. The police of the future have nothing in common with the police of the past. Guns are outlawed, as is all physical violence. Los Angeles is no more, having merged with San Diego into a new entity known as San Angeles, which is ruled by the architect of the new society, Dr. Raymond Cocteau, who is played with sage aplomb by the late Nigel Hawthorne. He is not, however, all that he seems.

This is, indeed, a ""brave new world"" and Lenina Huxley, played with delicious comic abandon by Sandra Bullock, is a police woman who waxes nostalgic for the past. The LAPD is now the SAPD. Her colleague, Alfredo Garcia, played with Eagle Scout earnestness by Benjamin Bratt, epitomizes the new order of things. He is a Dudley-do-right without the wherewithal to set right what is soon to go wrong. His is a future where everyone's whereabouts are known to the police, as all are tagged with a device that allows the police monitor their whereabouts. His is a future where all obey instantly, and civility is the standard of the day. His is a future where all address each other by their full names. His is a future where meat is no longer a food item, the use of salt is illegal, and corporate franchise wars have left Taco Bell to reign supreme as THE restaurant of the time. His is a future where sex is a non-contact activity.

The violent past intrudes on this sanitized future in the persona of Simon Phoenix, played with over-the-top abandon by a blond Wesley Snipes, who, like a phoenix arising out of the ashes, is freed from his cryogenic prison and unleashed upon an unprepared SAPD. Clueless in the face of such testosterone charged violence, the SAPD arrange to have twentieth century super lawman John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) released from his own cryogenic prison in hopes that he will be able to deal with the chaotic nature of Simon Phoenix and stop his senselessly violent rampage. Lenina Huxley is teamed up with Spartan in order to help him adjust to this brave new world. She is over-the-top with happiness at this development, as her fondness for nostagia will be sated by the opportunity to get up close and personal with a blast from the past.

Needless to say, Spartan and Phoenix clash, as old warriors are won't to do. There is enough violence, mayhem, and action to satisfy the most die hard fans of this genre. What happens will not disappoint the viewer, as old scores are settled, inequitable situations are righted, and a brave new world gets a little fine tuning for the better. This action flick, sci-fi crossover does not fail to entertain, and it does so more intelligently than most films in this genre.

545513,4,6303012140,"I like this movie. While Stallone has proven repeatedly he is not a great actor, he does manage to make some entertaining films. This is one of 'em.

Ya got a futuristic society where criminals are frozen. Great idea. Thawing them out for parole hearings then drowning them again seemed to be a bit on the 'cruel and unusual' side of things, though.  Sparton (Stallone) was a cop unjustly frozen while capturing Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). Phoenix escapes and Sparton is thawed to help capture him.

Snipes should not have gotten a dime for doing this movie. In fact, he should have forked over some $$ to the producers. It is obvious he is having a ball here being the bad guy while doing an entertaining impersonation of Dennis Rodman. (Am I the only one who saw this?) He is bloody perfect in the role. If Rodman could act (and I did see him in a movie, no, he is definately NOT an actor) he'd have been a good Phoenix, too. Still, Snipes, ever the crook, steals all the scenes in which he appears. Not difficult when he's playing against Stallone, but still very good.

Bullock got a great part, did well in it, and worked wonders for her carreer. She owes whoever picked her for the part a big thank you. Honestly, any cutie could have done her role. Just as any of a hundred Hollywood types could have done Stallones. Snipes was the only perfectly cast actor in the bunch.

Anyway, you have Sparton and Phoenix fighting their way through the movie, along with a cameo by Jesse the Body (Why? No one knows.) The ending is predicable, the good guys win.

Scary to think we are halfway to that reality as it is. This movie is full of useless one-liners that almost every american action film is required to have. They aren't as annoying as arnold's movies, and the delivery is pretty funny so it isn't too bad. The action scenes are clearly the standout moments, the one in the museum being the best in the film.

545549,4,6303012140,"Sylvester Stallone has been in some really bad movies; most notably Cobra and, of course, Rhinestone.
In 1993, Stallone made a breakthrough, a breakthrough meaning that he made movies that people didn't walk out on! First off that year, he made Cliffhanger, which was a big domestic and worldwide box office success, and then he followed that with Demolition Man, which was his best breakthrough movie since...well, Cliffhanger.

The movie mixes the usual action with humor. Sandra Bullock cuteness and Wesley Snipes' whacky hairdo and funny oneliners makes this movie watchable. Stallone plays bad-boy cop John Spartan who is frozen in time for irresponsibly taking the lives of innocent people after a bust to catch bad guy Simon Phoenix, played by Snipes, who is caught and put in an ice cube also. 36 years later, the world is a much safer place. Crime is at a rate of zero and people are well-behaved. What happens next? Simon Phoenix escapes from his prison and he is out in search of destruction and since there are no equally demented cops to catch this sort of criminal, they release Spartan to pursue him. And the fun begins! Bullock plays the role of a 90's obsessed cop who becomes Stallone's partner. Her quotes are the funniest in the entire film. ... The movie also features funny cameos by Denis Leary and Rob Schneider.

Despite the movie being a mixture of action and comedy and not solely comedy, this is one of Stallone's funniest roles to date.

The DVD features only include the trailer and shot-by-shot commentary by the film's director Marco Brambilla. But for the movie's sake, this DVD is worth keeping!

545550,5,6303012140,"Initially, when I saw the preview for this movie back in 1993, I will be the first to admit that I thought this movie was going to be terrible.  However, I was convinced to watch this movie when it came out on video and I must say that this is one of the best sci-fi/action movies I have seen.

Demolition Man takes place in the year 2032 in the city of San Angeles, which encompasses the current day cities of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego.  The society closely mimics the society described in the book ""The Time Machine"" by H.G. Wells.  Most of society resembles the ""Eloi"".  Society has turned into a utopia of political correctness.  Most everyday things have been made illegal including swearing, sex, spicy foods, and salt for example.  The city has no violence or firearms of any kind.  Rather than prison, criminals are frozen and rehabilitated during their ""hibernation"".  However, there is an underground ""Morlock"" type society known as ""scaps"" in the movie.  The ""scraps"" are the free thinkers, which I would compare to modern day Americans.

The leader of San Angeles secretly releases a violent criminal, Simon Phoenix (played by Wesley Snipes) to kill the leader of the ""scraps"", Edgar Friendly (played by Dennis Leary).  The police release another ""cryo-con"", a maverick 20th century cop named John Spartan (played by Sylvester Stallone) who originally captured Phoenix in the 20th century and was framed during the arrest of Phoenix.  Spartan is partnered with a bored officer named Lenina Huxley (played by Sandra Bullock), who is a nave police officer obsessed with the 20th century.

The result is an awesome action film with a shaky plot.  This movie reminds me a lot of ""The Last Boyscout"", a loud movie with a lot of shootouts.  However, this film is also filled with many laughs, as Huxley rattles off many 20th century clichs but manages to screw most of them up.  Product placement in the movie is everywhere.  Despite the frequent referral to brand names that would become nauseous in most movies, the product placement works very well in this movie and adds to the comedy and charm.  The movie also makes references to a couple of 20th century actors such as Arnold Schwartzenegger and Jackie Chan.

If you enjoy an occasional pointless, loud, violent action movie, this is definitely the movie for you.  While I would not rate this movie as a masterpiece, I do think this is one of the few movies that pull action and comedy together exceptionally well.  I thought the mix of actors worked exceptionally well in this movie and complimented each other beautifully.  I would definitely say this is a must see movie!  I think the movie is even better now as it brings up a lot of memories of the late 80's and early 90's.",1118102400,2,2758,4.757894736842105

In simple words, Taco bell was not very famous abroad and was replaced in the international edition with Pizza Hut in video and audio presence too.

Of course they are brands of the same gruop (Pepsi): it was something coordinated with the producer and the corporate involved.

Well it seems a mix up back in the day got our two leads locked in cryo-prison where they stayed frozen in their distinctive eras. At a parole hearing Phoenix escapes and the new world is needless to say ill equipped to handle a criminal as violent as he is. This leads to the reanimation of Stallone and the chase is on.

First, Stallone's daughter is mentioned yet that matter is never resolved.  (Why mention something if you won't follow through?)
Second, since this is done in a ""comic-book"" style, as a personal preference, I would have liked to have seen Snipes' death left somewhat ""ambiguous"" (so he can come back & plague Stallone in a sequel!)  That's just a preference, though.

Listen for Bullock's reference to Jackie Chan's movies BEFORE he hit it big in the U.S. & is it just me, or does anybody else notice that Wesely Snipes' ""Simon Phoenix"" character resembles the Joker?",1044662400,,1454,5.210300429184549
545633,4,6303012140,"This is an enormously entertaining film that is slyly intelligent,  chock full of action, and quite humorous. The time is the future, 2032 AD. The location is California, and the police just ain't what they used to be, as the future is a sanitized, politically correct world, where only the most benign  behavior is the standard by which all live. Even bad language is a no no.  The police of the future have nothing in common with the police of the past. Guns are outlawed, as is all physical violence. Los Angeles is no more, having merged with San Diego into a new entity known as San Angeles, which is ruled by the architect of the new society, Dr. Raymond Cocteau, who is played with sage aplomb by the late Nigel Hawthorne. He is not, however, all that he seems.

This is, indeed, a ""brave new world"" and Lenina Huxley, played with delicious comic abandon by Sandra Bullock, is a police woman who waxes nostalgic for the past. The LAPD is now the SAPD. Her colleague, Alfredo Garcia, played with Eagle Scout earnestness by Benjamin Bratt, epitomizes the new order of things. He is a Dudley-do-right without the wherewithal to set right what is soon to go wrong. His is a future where everyone's whereabouts are known to the police, as all are tagged with a device that allows the police monitor their whereabouts. His is a future where all obey instantly, and civility is the standard of the day. His is a future where all address each other by their full names. His is a future where meat is no longer a food item, the use of salt is illegal, and corporate franchise wars have left Taco Bell to reign supreme as THE restaurant of the time. His is a future where sex is a non-contact activity.

The violent past intrudes on this sanitized future in the persona of Simon Phoenix, played with over-the-top abandon by a blond Wesley Snipes, who, like a phoenix arising out of the ashes, is freed from his cryogenic prison and unleashed upon an unprepared SAPD. Clueless in the face of such testosterone charged violence, the SAPD arrange to have twentieth century super lawman John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) released from his own cryogenic prison in hopes that he will be able to deal with the chaotic nature of Simon Phoenix and stop his senselessly violent rampage. Lenina Huxley is teamed up with Spartan in order to help him adjust to this brave new world. She is over-the-top with happiness at this development, as her fondness for nostagia will be sated by the opportunity to get up close and personal with a blast from the past.

Needless to say, Spartan and Phoenix clash, as old warriors are won't to do. There is enough violence, mayhem, and action to satisfy the most die hard fans of this genre. What happens will not disappoint the viewer, as old scores are settled, inequitable situations are righted, and a brave new world gets a little fine tuning for the better. This action flick, sci-fi crossover does not fail to entertain, and it does so more intelligently than most films in this genre. Make no mistake, however, while Wesley Snipes gives her a run for her money, it is Sandra Bullock who steals the show with her drolly delivered dialogue, her deft comedic timing and innate charm. Sylvester Stallone, as wooden as ever, is not even a blip on the radar.",1039305600,34,3282,4.640275387263339
545634,4,6303012140,"Sylvester Stallone is John Spartan, the infamous ""Demolition Man"" of the LAPD, a one man SWAT team with more brawn than brains.  In the near future, Spartan botches a hostage situation involving a one-man crime wave named Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes).  Though Phoenix is caught, all the hostages are killed.  Both Phoenix and Spartan are convicted and sentenced to cryogenic suspended animation - Spartan for 40 years, Phoenix forever.  Spartan is re-animated in the less near future decades later for an impromptu parole board review.  By now, the city is cleaner, neater and much more polite (everybody carries personal locators imbedded in them and are monitored at all times; bad langauge is punishable; guns are completely outlawed - it's like Singapore and ""Rodeo Drive"").  Ruled by the sage Dr. Cocteau, everybody speaks in full sentences and call each other by their full name - all the time.  In other words - it's a time that neither Phoenix nor Spartan belong in.  Mysteriously, Phoenix manages to end run the security devices holding him in - escaping into a future ill-equipped to deal with him.  When Phoenix singlehandedly wipes out a squad of future-cops sent to reel him in, PO Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) comes up with the desperate idea of re-animating Spartan, thinking him the only one capable of taking Phoenix down.  Spartan finds the new era a shock - meat is outlawed, corporate franchises operate at every economic level (witness our heroes enjoying an elegant dinner party...at Taco Bell!?!?) and pop-culture is devoted to old commercial jingles.  He also finds that plain old poverty survived the brave new world - with a tribe of starving bandits eking out a bare (if un PC existence) in the old LA sewers behind the oddly named Ed Friendly (Denis Leary).  While committed to icing Phoenix (for good this time) Spartan also pursues an odd link between Phoenix and the seemingly sage Dr. Cocteau, the architect of this brave new world.
Though it's big and loud, there's more to this action flick than Joel Silver pyrotechnics (this is opposite of ""Swordfish"" which was supposedly was about cyber-crime and terrorism, but instead really was about big explosions, rapid fire weapons and skin).  Instead, the flick slyly creates political correctness only to have both Phoenix and Spartan blast it to pieces - when Phoenix compares Cocteau to an evil version of ""Mr. Rodgers"", you'll know for certain.  If you had to read ""Brave New World"" in school, you'll find some references linking the flick and the book, but mostly it's about weak and polite people getting beaten or thrown through plate glass or simply running or fainting away in cowardice at the slightest sign of danger.  The script is great, having the future citizens speak in a new age style of speech in which they dish out such howlers as ""dump your hormones"" and ""what is your boggle"".  Stallone is great as a pirahna out of water, completely out of his league in a future that has no 4-letter words.  But Snipes is also great playing the hyper-everything Simon Phoenix in an over-the-top performance that hints at how much fun the ""Blade"" movies could have been.  Sandra Bullock threatens to steal the movie playing the little-girl adult character of Lenina Huxley (one of the flick's more overt references to ""Brave New World"") whose loyalty to the new age masks a nostalgia for the old ways (with their action, their big, unsafe and inefficient cars, and their idiotic catch phrases ""Take this job and shovel it!"" and ""let's blow this guy"")  Any way you cut it, a fun flick you should blow (away) some time with.",1038441600,,3611,4.899835796387521
545635,4,6303012140,"The irony that defines this popcorn pleasure can be summed up with the comments of the unimportant little girl to the reporter who questioned the over-all worth of Spartan's rescueing her with such damage, ""F*ck you, lady!"" This film came after The Last Boy Scout and before The Professional, so the presence of such a verbally feral child was thankfully breif.
  As for the action, we have some of the best inserted John Wooisms to come out of 1993(Hard Target, aside). Some good jumping,diving, a little of the required two-gun alternation.  There is the Bad Good Guy, and the really likable Bad Guy, and instead of the universal terrorist (Al Leong, where has he gone?) We have, you guessed it... Minnesota Gov.-to-be Jesse Ventura ventilating the ""evil Mr. Roger's"" since Pheonix's manchurian reprogramming prevents it.
  Considering the state of Sci-Fi action at the time, it was disappointing that the rest of the movie couldn't live up to the Wile E Coyote pace of the Museum peice. Otherwise a good handing-over of the riens flick for Stallone, to Snipes. Now if Stallone would just get some more ""Daylight"" and less ""Driven"".
  I can't leave without saying how much this movie benefitted from the presence of the West Coast Automotive Design Industry contribution. Take a could look. Some of those vehicles are prototypes that have hit, and left, the street. Back to the Future, indeed.",1033084800,,1395,4.96137339055794

To watch it again is to listen and hear all of the nuances of that dialog and the terrific action sounds.

After being cyrogenically frozen since 1996, Los Angeles' most forceful police officer John Spartan and Los Angeles' most ruthless criminal Simon Phoenix, have been brought back for the fight of the galaxy! Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes are dynamite. Phoenix (Snipes) has been brought back to assassinate a homeless rebel leader and Spartan (Stallone) has been brought back to stop the sadistic man. Oh my word! Phoenix learned martial arts and curses up a storm at a bank machine. I know the feeling! But, a censoring program will not allow Phoenix to swear and he gets even more upset. Hostility! The year now is 2032 and San Diego and Los Angeles have been merged as San Angeles. It is a time of peace and 'be well' amongst society. Unfortunately, all of the smiley faces have been introduced to Phoenix and Spartan! Phoenix goes to a museum and gets some artillery. Spartan follows and they fight to the finish. Spartan took time to get used to the 'new' times. He swears plenty, wants to eat meat and doesn't understand Sandra Bullock. The mayor of San Angeles dresses in bedsheets and told Spartan to 'be well' when he was angry. Spartan's response is ultimate and forever will be memorable. You'll have to see it to live it! This movie made me want to go back in time and see it for the first time again. Too bad there weren't any special features on the DVD. But, it's ok, this movie is a masterpiece and was overlooked at every awards ceremony. Rip-roaring entertainment that anybody would love.

This isn't at all like any of stallone's cheesy action flicks or like the incredibly stupid ""Blade"" with snipes, this was by far one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever watched, closely rivaling ""the matrix"".  Stallone is still a little wooden as far as his acting goes but I think he fits the part well, and Snipes, in my opinion is exelent in this one.  The main reason i liked this movie so much is the plot.  The plot is so fun, thought-provoking and original, I would have seen the movie just for the idea.

While the story line was nothing beyond the usual action film gun totting good guy (Stallone) vs. evil psycotic bad guy (Snipes) the social and technological concepts covered in this film really make a person think what could be accomplished & avoided in creating a more peaceful society.
It would be interesting to see a prequel movie or book based on the forming of San Angelas and characters like Chief Erl, Mayor-Gov Raymond Cocto and Warden William Smithers, but I don't think this movie did well enough at the box office for this to become a reality.

545745,3,6303012140,"DEMOLTION MAN is perhaps one of the dumbest of the ""dumb action"" action movies, due to it's dialouge and handle on how a near future society might behave and act.  DEMOLITION MAN is also a lot of fun, not the most fun I've ever had at a movie, but fun nonetheless in part to the film's at times, dumb nature.
Stallone's character Officer John Spartan has finally captured his arch nemisis Simon Phoenix (Snipes) and locked him up.  However, Spartan's often brutal practices on the job along with Phoenix's evil attitude have landed them both into a cryogenic rehabilitation.  Both can re-enter society when their rehab is deemed complete.
It is now the early part of the 21st century and Phoenix has been broken out of his cryo-prison and is running amok in a super-peacy society that can't control him.  (Cops don't carry guns only batons, using profanity can get you fined, Taco Bell won the ""Francize War"" and is the only restaurant around and don't even ask about sex, it's weird.) The local San Angeles (you heard right,) police force needs to unleash Spartan so he can restore order and stop Phoenix.  Spartan is viewed as either a gunslining old-tyme hero by some or as a brow furrowing caveman by the others.  Spartans new partner Huxley (Sandra Bullock, pre SPEED) is assigned as his partner and helps Spartan adjust to his new surroundings as they together must stop Phoenix's chaos streak.
Certainly not the greatest action movie out there, but for a action fan, it has plenty of action to keep one entertained.  Especially one who is a fan of the Future Society action movie.  A step either ahead or behind Stallone's JUDGE DREDD but with both behind CLIFFHANGER.  Two little notes before I move on.  1 ""Murder,Death,Kill"" is the dumbest expression I may have ever heard in a movie. 2  Am I alone in thinking that Sandra Bullock looks cute in that cop outfit of hers?",990403200,3,1879,4.698170731707317

545747,5,6303012140,"Demolition Man is one of those rare action flicks that seem to have intellegence beyond the guns and explosions. Sylvester Stallone plays John Spartan, a reckless cop who has made it his mission to bring down his arch-enemy Simon Phoenix. Phoenix is a crime lord who has kidnapped 30 bus passengers. John Spartan rushes in and attempts to save them and apprehend Phoenix, but the passengers apparently die in an explosion set by Phoenix. John Spartan is arrested for the deaths of the passengers and charged with involuntary manslaughter, and both men are sent to a cryogenic prison, and frozen. But decades later in the year 2032, Phoenix escapes, and all hell breaks loose.
The world has become peaceloving, and there are no more violent weapons on the streets, and physical contact of any kind is frowned upon. So you can imagine the kind of time a criminal like Phoenix would be having. The only way to stop him is to thaw Spartan, and soon the 2 enemies go at it all over the futuristic city of San Angeles. Sandra Bullock also stars as the cop who becomes the partner of Spartan in the future, and she starts to question everything she has been brought up to believe in.
This is where the film becomes an intellegent satire as well as an action film. The future, while bright and crime-free, has left the world without freedom. Salt, red meat, and even sex has become illegal. The police encode chips into peoples hands so they can keep track of them wherever they go. But once Spartan is released, he takes an immediate disliking to the brave new world. Interlaced in all of this is plenty of humor in the dialogue, as Stallone's character does and says things that freaks out the people around him who have never seen behavior like that before. As for the action, this film has some incredible action scenes. There is a brawl between Phoenix and Spartan on a futuristic highway going 70 miles an hour, and plenty of shootouts. This DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras, but there is a good commentary by the director, and standard/wide picture sizes of the film, and a trailer.

John Spartan (Stallone) has been after this guy for several years, but in the process of finally arresting Phoenix, the building around them explodes, appartently taking several innocent hostages up with it.  Spartan is stripped of his rank and sentenced to cryogenic imprisonment for 70 years.
2032:  Spartan has served 36 years of his sentence.  Phoenix, who was imprisoned in the same facility, escapes and begins to reinvigorate his reign of terror.  The only problem is that the LA that Spartan, Phoenix, and the rest of us all know and love has turned into a megalopolis called San Angeles, a politically correct paradise where there is absolutely no violent crime---correction, no crime of any kind---whatsoever. (There is also no profanity, and anyone who swears is fined for violations of the Verbal Morality Statute.) Consequently, people have forgotten how to deal with a fugitive like Phoenix.  The only solution is to bring Spartan out of the freezer, which is exactly what happens.
This movie introduced me to action movies, particularly Stallone movies, and the movie soundtrack genre.  The special effects will blow you away all by themselves.  This was also the first movie I ever saw with Sandra Bullock.  Perhaps it's because of her airy portrayal of Lt. Huxley that made me think of her as my favorite actress for a while.  But that's another story.
I think that San Angeles is a funny bone-tickling example of political correctness gone to far.  Either that or it's social conservatism. Sometimes I wonder if San Angeles is the kind of world people in the family values crowd would like to live in.

None of this movie makes any  sense, but its running jokes are amusing.  The futuristic society is the  apotheosis of political correctness and pacifism, and the only weapons are  those on display in a museum...and fortunately for Snipes' character, the  pacifist nimrods displayed fully functional firearms, with plenty of of  ammo.  Fortunately, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously.
