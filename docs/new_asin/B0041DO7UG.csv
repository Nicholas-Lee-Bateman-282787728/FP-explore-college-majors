8412602,3,B0041DO7UG,"I thought this was going to be a lot better because of its release date (2005, right in the middle of some of the most explicit releases I've ever seen from Penthouse).  Sadly, it was a bit of a letdown because they insist on self-censoring in the editing room.  The recording quality is kind of grainy and in 4:3 shot on video, but no digital artifact problems that I detected - overall it looks and sounds acceptable for sure.  No obnoxious lighting or camera movement either, its all fairly calm, warm, sensual stuff.  But we've come back around to some frustrating editing - seems like they shot footage that got really explicit but it was then cut for content.

First scene - three girls go at it, full frontal and some stroking but camera actually stands still too much (not usually a shortcoming for Penthouse) and the scene ends before anything really good happens.
Second scene - Aria solo, lots of pink since her lips open almost as soon as her legs, no blatant spreads or insertions though.
Third scene - two women go wild on each other, they are hot but intensely BS editing, feels cut down A LOT, some full nudity but not much genuine action is visible, looks like they kept the simulated stuff and cut all the real oral or finger action.
Fourth scene - nice solo but she is on her feet the entire time, very gorgeous (and love those cute little stretch marks on her hips) and she does stroke her puss a little bit but legs aren't apart so that limits the thrills somewhat, and the scene felt like it was over rather quickly.
Fifth scene is a cute phone masturbation thing with two girls intercut, one does faux stroking only (no fingertips) but plenty of legs spread, the other gets very enthusiastic in her stroking and the editors seem to have done a crappy digital zoom to crop out some of the visible labia and put her bottom just out of frame, WTF thats a new one in the edited for content toolbag makes the latter parts very grainy.
Sixth scene, nice solo but again the editors minimize the views of her stroking with cutaways, etc so we never get as close as what was actually filmed.
Last scene, shes on the stairs but theres no pink at all - full nudity but she sits on it and keeps her knee in the way.

Overall it's a pretty good DVD and as long as you don't expect it to get too daring, it's not bad.  What there is to see does linger a decent amount, so that is appreciated.  But part of me just doesn't understand why they would film one thing and then show us such a limited amount of it.",1421971200,3,2517,4.340425531914893

  Penthouse hasn't had a hit since their 2004 Pet of the Year video.  Before that, their last decent features were the 2003 Playoff and Pet of the Year features.  Everything else has been sub-par.  Most of the videos being released under the Penthouse mantle these days have nothing to do with Guccione and crew (then again, they're basically out of it themselves these days).  The most recent videos seem to be ""directed"" by James Hoffer, who seems to splice older footage together to make a ""new"" feature.

  This has to be the lamest excuse for a softcore feature ever.  We get seven scenes: a three-girl intro, Aria on a bed, girl-girl on a bed, Natalia on the stairs, girl-girl (over the phone), Megan on the beach, and Zdenka on a different staircase.  The first, third, and fifth scenes are all reused, and shot in a much lower quality format than the four scenes featuring the Pets.  The third and fifth are blatant video transfers of older, hardcore pornography -sloppily edited to fit into the softcore genre.  The phone sex sequence is the worst offender of these -the editor zooms in partway to crop out the women's hands going to town on themselves.  The remaining picture is so friggin' hazy, grainy, and distorted that I really have to wonder how Penthouse has fallen so low.

The scenes that appear new are pretty tame by Penthouse standards.  The film quality is much nicer than the reused scenes though.  Aria spends most of her scene hiding her lower bits from the audience, Natalia give a really nice performance (by Penthouse year 2000 standards), as does Zdenka.  Megan Mason gets a little friskier than the other three.  Lynn Turner, the ""mystery Pet"" listed on the back doesn't get a new scene, and is featured in the poorly lit opener with Lorissa McComas and some other woman.

  None of these scenes justifies purchasing this cheaply produced piece of crap.  This DVD isn't even fit to be used as a coaster.  Just a hint Penthouse: if you name a feature after one of your most popular models, try featuring her more than once in the damn thing.  This could have been great if Hoffer had just stuck with the new solo footage, then shot some new girl-girl scenes with these models.  Aria and Natalia?  Megan Mason and anyone?  C'mon folks!  If Amazon allowed for a rating lower than one star, I'd give it.  Don't waste your money.

  Damn I miss Guccione & Co.

Pros:  The DVD slip-cover looks half-way decent.

Cons:  Extremely tame solo scenes from four very beautiful Pets, heavy use of older footage, poor video quality transfer in older footage, ridiculously bad editing in blatantly low-budget porn, offers false hope of a feature centered around Aria Giovanni, seemingly announces the official death knoll for Penthouse video.",1122336000,31,2990,4.853174603174603
