It was obviously done on a limited budget but that just means a person has to work harder to make things work rather rely on the effects to save the show.  The stories were quite good and had a nice twist to them that sets them apart from many other shows in this genre.  One of the things I really liked about this movie was that the actors look like real people, folks we work with and talk to in everyday life, this makes the film more believable and realistic to me.

My best to Director: Jim Haggerty and Actors: Suzi Lorraine, Tina Krause, Nathalie Bryant, Jae Mosc, Pooya Mohseni for a cool movie.  I am looking forward to the next one.

""When Death Calls"" is a winner in my opinion, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good suspenseful scary movie.",1349568000,7,845,4.25
