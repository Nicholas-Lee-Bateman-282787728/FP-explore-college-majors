8342753,5,B001U3YNCC,"Father Matthews is relevant, entertaining, sincere, funny, and very creative. The puppets really take explaining the Episcopal faith to another level. It's the only series of its kind on all of YouTube. I bought the DVD to see these all at once, and to share with my church library. Well worth the money.",1336521600,,304,4.754716981132075
8342754,5,B001U3YNCC,"Let's face it... Religion and video don't always translate. I mean did you ever see Hollywood getting excited about God? (The Bells of St. Mary's was released when? You get the point...) Father Matthew has done something important here. He has found a way to make the Sacraments of the church interesting. Through the use of humor, creativity, and music he engages adults and children alike to think about how God works. Father Matthew Presents the Sacraments is a wonderful entry point to discover the depth and significance of the Sacraments. It should be a must own for any Priest, Sunday School, educator engaged in helping the faithful discover the depth of God being present amongst us.",1236211200,3,692,4.923076923076923
