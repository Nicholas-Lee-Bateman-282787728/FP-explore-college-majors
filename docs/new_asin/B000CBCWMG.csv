8337585,4,B000CBCWMG,"When Souichiro and Bob confront the Student Council about Maya's expulsion from school, they are able to handle all the small fry but things come to a crushing halt when they battle with Bunshichi, who is way beyond the two street thugs in terms of skill. During the course of the battle it is revealed that the reason why Souichiro is fighting so hard is that he LOVES Maya, which is unfortunately heard by Aya, due to her psychic-like abilities, which have already hinted that this was so. Takayanagi, meanwhile, sees a chance to finally bust a move on Aya in her fragile mental state, hoping to supply a shoulder to cry on, and a bed to lie in! But I wouldn't get too close, because Aya is becoming more and more consumed with the strange and dangerous power of the Reiki sword. Then it's back to the past and the beginning of the story of who really killed Aya's brother years ago.

Before, to a certain point, I thought that the flashback story arc about Maya's brother was more interesting than Souichiro's and Bob's quest to become top dog at school, but when it sank to needless excess and bloodletting, I began to lose interest. Surprisingly, Aya brings some much needed realism to this volume of Tenge because you can really feel her pain as she learns that the man she thought was destined to marry her loves her sister! She shows a bit more edge and maturity that takes us beyond her bubbly, cute, and klutzy image that we had gotten so far. Takayanagi is also good in these episodes too as he tries to balance his lust/love for Aya with his desire to comfort her. Just when things were getting good, we have to go back to the past which Tenge has already dwelled on too long. This volume is worth it just for the first two episodes.",1159488000,,1745,4.43613707165109
