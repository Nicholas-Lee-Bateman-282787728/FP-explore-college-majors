A young man carries the body or a young woman into a shed. Later he is stopped by a policeman. Step out of the car. Ann Rule gets a call from Ted. There is a flashback to when a Suicide Crisis Hotline gets a call. This call is traced, the police arrive in time. Ann Rule writes true crime stories. Three years later a girls body was found. The danger in hitchhiking is real. Ted volunteers for a political campaign. Ted has changed. Ann Rule gets a call about six missing girls, about one a month. Ted asks a young woman for help with a dead battery. [No good deed ever goes unpunished is a NY city saying.] How could a young woman disappear without a trace? There are hundreds of Teds who drive a VW in a hundred mile radius. How many match the description? They show how Ted picks up another victim - he pretends to be a cop - he has identification! Note how he affects familiarity! But she gets away! He tries again and succeeds.

Her body and three others are found. Then he is stopped by a policeman and taken in. Are those burglary tools? There are three missing girls in Utah. This makes the national news. Ted call Ann Rule for help. Did he see a lawyer? A publisher offers a book deal to Ann. The police concentrate on Ted Bundy and the circumstantial evidence. Ann cant believe it. An ex-girlfriend tells Ann about Ted and his behavior. Ted was released and is back in Seattle. He was raised by a single mother; his grandparents helped. Ted is found guilty in Utah and gets 1 to 15 years. Colorado wants to extradite him. Ann loves her work as a writer. Who humiliated Ted? Ann feels guilty in not seeing any signs in Teds behavior. Ted escaped from jail in Colorado and fled to Florida. He looks for another victim and enters a big house, going from room to room. He rushes out, a student screams! Then he is stopped and arrested. He is still a monster. Ted calls Ann Rule and still claims innocence. [Has his personality changed?]

Ted displays personal charm and acts as his own lawyer. Young women attend the trial; a fan club? Ted has a friend now, Kelly believes in him. An expert testifies about bite mark evidence. [Is this still considered reliable?] Ted shows his cleverness in answering questions. They jury says guilty as charged! A young woman tells how the victims resembled her. Ann learns more about Teds background. His grandfather was a violent man. A girlfriend testifies in favor of Ted. He proposes in front of a judge and she accepts. That makes them married under Florida law. Ted insists he didn't do the murders at that sorority house. Ted gets a death sentence, the judge comments on Teds personality. Ann Rule visits him in prison and asks about Sara Jane Sweeney. Can she understand Ted? Ted denies doing it still. Then he tries to put off the death sentence by offering to reveal where the missing bodies are! This deal is refused. The sentence is carried out.

But we don't know why he did it. Are some people just bad and get a thrill from killing? Is there anyway to determine this beforehand? Serial murderers are hard to catch because there is no previous connection between the victim and the killer. Most murders occur between people who know each other. Usually it involves love or money. Does the ease of travel allow serial killers the opportunity? Beware of any person who tries to manipulate your thinking, especially a stranger. This story tells nothing about Teds upbringing as a boy and teenager. Could he really have first killed at age fourteen?",1503532800,,3557,4.527216174183515
