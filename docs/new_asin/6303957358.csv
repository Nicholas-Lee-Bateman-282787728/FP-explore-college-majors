746532,5,6303957358,"Fraternity Vacation is an excellent movie. I love this film. Stephen Georffeys is excellent as Wendell Tvedt, as well as Amanda Bearse. All the actors are well casted. Cameron Dye as Joe and Tim Robbins as Mother are hilerious and are well paired as buddies. Sheree J. Wilson is excellent and charming. It's nice to see Barbara Crampton and Kathleen Kinmont in their somewhat small roles. With this movie, you just have fun. It's funny, there's some romance and a little bit of nudity, if your Barbara Crampton and Kathleen Kinmont fans-you'll love it. This film is a classic in my opinion.

This is their best work ever.",1034035200,5,230,4.372093023255814
746534,5,6303957358,"One should see this movie solely to see Stephen Geoffreys and Amanda Bearse working together again (from FRIGHT NIGHT). When watching the topless scenes, remember, this is fro mthe guy that directed THE MUPPET MOVIE.",1022284800,2,216,5.2

746664,4,6303957358,I enjoyed this movie as a kid and thought this was a fun spring break film. And as an adult I still think it is hilarious! I did not mind paying the price for this DVD because I hated the cheesy cover art of the cheaper versions!,1358380800,,229,3.893617021276596
746665,3,6303957358,"I recently purchased the VHS version of Fraternity Vacation distributed by R & G Video and Starmaker.  I had owned an individual DVD copy of this film as well as a copy included in a budget twofer.  Both DVD versions were widescreen, meaning the top and bottom of the screen had been cropped.

The good news on the VHS version is that it is not cropped or not cropped as much as the widescreen DVD versions.  This means you can see a bit more of Kathleen Kinmont and Barbara Crampton for a split second in their infamous scene with Tim Robbins.  The bad news is the VHS videotape was recorded in EP, rather than SP.  The overall picture quality is fair at best, ranging from poor to good.  There are some dropouts and excessive video noise on at least a few segments, and the picture is often fuzzy.

The film itself is a well-known 80's teen comedy, so I won't review it.  The negatives outweigh the positives on the VHS version, so I recommend you stick to the DVD.  If you can find a standard screen DVD or a VHS recorded at SP at a reasonable price, you might consider it.  Otherwise, you are missing very little in the widescreen DVD.",1343865600,,1139,4.350710900473934
746666,3,6303957358,"A story is of students from different ""fraternities"" who were driving expensive cars in the Florida resort they made to from somewhere in Alaska and the least capable among them to seduce made it with an iconic girl all young males bet to do it first.

Completely stupid movie.",1328313600,,277,4.653061224489796
746667,4,6303957358,"I was expecting more based on the reviews on Amazon. Fraternity Vacation is Not a teen Sex Comedy and is extremely tame especially for 1985! I am 35 years old and remember watching this in my early teens on USA up all night. It was censored but this is the same movie minus a little and I mean little, nudity. A good cast Cameron Dye, (What happened to him?), Stephen Geoffreys, and a kind of young Tim Roth. However Not too many laughs a goofy dream girl plot that goes nowhere and what you have is a PG-13 fun silly 80's teen film. In the UK this might have got a PG, but especially when I was young as is now one scene of Boobs and you have an R-rating in the US. In Europe they don't mind the nudity as much but give harder ratings for the violence, I agree 100 percent with that premise! The United States is the exact opposite! Overall this is a standard silly teen comedy I enjoyed at 12 years old but not so much now. It's not bad with such a great cast, it can be fun, just don't expect anything past a good old fun but very mild teen Comedy/Romance. ..............I recommend These 80's teen sex comedy's.............Look for all of them especially the first it's the late 80's hidden jem T&A Jackpot! 1) Summer Job (Only available on VHS but this is the very best of the late 80's T&A films and is funny as well. This has Hot girls including a natural breasted and you Amy lynn Baxtor is her first movie! More nudity than a strip club, killer soundtrack and it's a party in itself! Highly Recommended! 2) Spring Break (Directed by Sean Cunningham 83') 3) The Beach Girls 4) Private school (Private school for girls, AKA) 5) The Last American Virgin, this is loaded but has a Sad ending that stops it from being a masterpiece, bad Idea by the director! 6) Loose Screws 7) Screwballs 8) There's alot more everybody Knows ""Revenge of the Nerds"", What a Classic! I hope Everybody forgets as I have ""Porkys"" A movie I hated and still do, Get the original for the shower Scene and that should cover it. I'm a comedian and the laughs are forced, they laugh uncontrollably and unrealistically at themselves more than you will! Can't wait rip apart this series in a separate review! .............If you can get your hands on old HBO/Cinemax movies nobody can find, (I'm getting there) good job!",1296950400,5,2296,4.4174528301886795
746668,4,6303957358,"Just an average teen flick, but it reminds me of spring break in Palm Springs before they shut it down. It was starting to get crazy early 90's. I was hoping to get the original artwork but that's okay, I enjoyed the movie again! Thanks!!!",1285200000,2,239,4.333333333333333

746670,5,6303957358,"Fraternity Vacation is a wonderful Movie,I have the dvd,For these Fraternity Guys,life is BEER,BABES And WILD PARTIES,But on Vacation They Really Cut Loose :P",1145145600,,158,5.625
746671,4,6303957358,"HEre's another great mindless comedy from the 80's. It such a shame they can't make movies like this anymore. Members of rival fraternities show up at Palm Springs for Spring Break. They make a thousand dollar bet on who can make it with the 'dream girl'. One decides to play a suicidal love-stricken romantic, the other a fitness guru. Both strike out, but have 'proof'.

Along for the ride is Wendyl. He's the astrology geek who ends up with the babe. But not before he gets involved with Amanda Bearse who's father is the town sheriff.

This movie has all the things that make 80's movies so great, a light plot, sex, nudity, low-brow humor, and doing things that would get you arrested today, but back then seemed innocent enough. Movies like this never won any awards, but they live forever to remind us of how much fun the 80's were.",1104537600,14,839,4.549668874172186
746672,5,6303957358,"Generally, I don't go for these misogynistic road-trip comedies that reward hyper-masculinity and the objectification of women. But that might be because generally, I don't know what the heck I'm talking about. I had to rethink my entire system of judgement when I saw the oft-overlooked cinematic jem from the people who brought you classics such as ""Vacation"" and ""European Vacation."" Well, actually, no, those people weren't involved in the making of ""Fraternity Vacition,"" but it's got the word ""Vaction"" in the title, so it's close enough. I don't want to spoil too much about this brilliant little film, but let's just say the guy who you'd expect not to get the girl... well, I'm not telling. But are you in for a surprise! Man! I can't remember the last time a film made me question the legitimacy of female suffrage! It's THAT awesome! I can't wait until I""m old enough to go on my first"" Fraternity Vacation""!",1091577600,,919,4.822784810126582
