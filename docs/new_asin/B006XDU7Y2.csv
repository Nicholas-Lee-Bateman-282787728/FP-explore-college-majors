5036516,5,B006XDU7Y2,This is a very decent anime I thought. I like the plot and the characters in the series. The main male protagonist is totally clueless but the story line is fun to watch.,1337212800,,170,4.181818181818182
5036517,3,B006XDU7Y2,"Overall its an OK anime but not 5 star worthy, at least not this season... That being said if there is a 2nd season then this might get better. If there isn't a 2nd season then this gets dropped to 1.5 stars. After introducing all these characters only to have one big battle doesnt make any sense to me. So in conclusion; this show has potential but worth waiting for the 2nd season to come out before getting this one.",1336608000,2,420,4.2625

5036519,5,B006XDU7Y2,"I love this series, I tend keep on watching because of the beautiful visuals. I watched when it was simulcasted and I enjoyed the artistry, but on blu ray it's as if everything is popping out at you. This includes an OVA which I saw for the first time in this set which seems to divided in two parts and pretty funny. This is a harem show, but it is funny.",1335916800,,356,4.028169014084507
5036520,5,B006XDU7Y2,"this is a harem anime , but the concept of the IS really stands out, when compared to other anime, for being only 12 episodes the series stands tall. there is fan service but nothing like sekirei or rosario + vampire.
 the story seems  romantic and lots of comedy , while balancing out with action scenes.
the story is basically introducing all the characters to the viewers and their romantic ties to our hero
there is to be an ova release , and hopefully a season 2 as i feel its left on a cliff hanger,and we as fans want it to continue.

5036521,4,B006XDU7Y2,"The overall quality is great, however im going to focus on the smaller things that may make or break this blu ray for you.

First, when it comes to sentai products they have a habit of rolling a long list of credits at the end of every episode. So if you're like me and you have it turned on and are just listening to it the end of the episodes may start to annoy you.

Second, be aware that the voice acting emphasizes the multi cultural aspect of the plot... by that I mean the voice actors really emphasized the accents of the individual characters. You get used to it but this could be a make or break, until you realize that the original audio is still on the disk as well as subtitles.

I would recommend this for people who watched it when it first aired, are into harems, and even robots. The quality is great and the item is packed with some extra bonuses like an soundtrack cd that has primarily has all the versions of Super Stream and a couple other songs as well as commentaries from the original japanese cast.

well worth the price",1334448000,15,1046,4.267676767676767

5036524,4,B006XDU7Y2,"Infinite Stratos is a typical storyline within the genre, not offering much in the way of anything new and innovative. It's a Harem style Anime, where the protagonist is one guy in a group of girls fighting for his attention while he remains clueless..... That being said, it is actually very well done. The story of Itchika, the lone male on the planet able to operate an I.S. unit, gets sent to a boarding school of all girl I.S. trainee pilots. While there are a few predictable plot twists, they were actually not so distracting from the story that it did any harm, and in fact quite the opposite, made for some really funny and endearing moments. Throw in the fact that Itchika's head instructor is a legend in the I.S. world, who also happens to be his older sister, and you have a pretty good series that is definitely worth watching. The fact that the voice actors go over the top with the ethnicity of the characters made me smile.... Especially, those of the main characters...... The drawing was crisp and clean, the sound is done very nicely, and while the credits are a little annoying they aren't as long as some others I've seen, so they don't detract from the series too much. With a TV-14 rating there is some minor fan service but it isn't lewd or over the top, which in this case is a good thing. In fact Itchika's embarrassment over seeing anything of the female body unclothed, while being labeled a pervert is hilarious....(High School DxD comes to mind, which I do in fact love). All in all I would say this is a good show.",1457049600,,1546,4.48581560283688

5036532,5,B006XDU7Y2,"Infinite Stratos is something that.... I don't even remember how I stumbled upon it. While the first two episodes are kind of slow, the show quickly became one of my favorites. It's a blending of mech, comedy, and romance that just feels so charming that it's hard to turn down. It starts to shine when the multiple love interests get involved, which is why the first two episodes are kind of dull. It starts off as basically an awkward highschool life simulator. But once you have the girls from China, Japan, England, Germany (the best one clearly ~_^) and france all coming together, it calls for some really awesome situations. If you're a native English speaker I suggest watching it dubbed to get a better feel for the characters and if you feel like watching it a second time, try it in Japanese. The english acting is kind of stiff but it's pretty good compared to a lot of whats out there and the japanese voice actors (for the girls) are pretty enjoyable to listen to. Also, as a side note, the soundtrack that comes with this is surprisingly nice. I tossed it into my car and have it play in the background on my five minute commute to work. Check it out, find your waifu, argue with people on the internet about your choice, and have fun with a great show.",1421366400,,1268,4.469827586206897

5036540,3,B006XDU7Y2,"The show wasn't what I was expecting coming from some of the reviews here on amazon. I don't know if people have actually watched the show before rating. From some of the reviews I thought this was going to have romance in it, but does not. Even the cover art would have suggested it. This series is just a plain harem anime with a clueless male character that doesn't pick any of the girls to have a relationship with. It is just the girls want to have a relationship with him. The harem anime I like has actual romance between two characters that actually fall in love with the rest of the cast of females against them. Ie, love hina, dusk maiden of amnesia, ai yori aoshi, clannad. If you hated the ending to Rosario vampire where the lead male doesn't pick any of the girls then you will not like this if you expect the male lead to pick a girl. I looked into season 2 of this series to see if any relationships blossom, nope. They are all still single still fighting over the male lead character- ichika

FYI if you are someone who hates censorship- this blu ray set is partly censored and not the Japanese uncensored version. normally when anime is put on Blu-ray they have been completely uncensored.",1395100800,4,1207,4.4125560538116595

5036543,5,B006XDU7Y2,"I fell in love with this series!! Total fanservice to be sure, however if you like girls, you can't go wrong with this one. I Love the artwork that was done, they didn't rely too heavily on CG animation (which can def take away from the overall aspect if used too much in my opinion). Good harem show, of course one inept guy surrounded by beautiful women lol The comedy is great, the bonds that form are also great. I think this is designed for you to fall in love with one or two characters (mine were definitely Charlotte and Laura) and hope that the main character ends up with one of them :) There isn't as much IS action as i would have liked, but there's enough action to keep even action fans drawn in. Worth every penny and a great addition to my collection, I just hope they do more seasons as they leave it slightly open.... (what anime doesn't :))",1387411200,,859,4.276073619631902

It comes in a slim Blu-ray case, no box or anything fancy like that. I originally viewed this anime on Youtube (well, a portion of it) and thought it looked decent enough to buy. At this very moment I am watching episode one on Blu-ray, and the difference is drastic. It's so much more satisfying to watch this anime on Blu-ray (1080p) compared to Youtube (360p). With Blu-ray, fight scenes that were once dull suddenly become eye-popping and captivating. For these reasons, I would definitely recommend this product.",1380153600,,644,4.863636363636363

5036546,4,B006XDU7Y2,"This show is little more than a basic harem series.  There's a main male character who could probably win the ""wimpiest man in the world"" award.  Due to a contrived setup he finds himself a lone male in a sea of women.  As in many a harem series, the main character shows no real interest in these women though they are desperately trying to get with him.  Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen's character) or any other outgoing philanderer he is not.  In fact, the protagonist here seems much more interested in his fellow men then he does in the ladies.  Is this the ""male lead in a harem show can't score as so not to offend the stereotypical male audience"" trope taken to an extreme or is the show trying to make a statement?  You be the judge of that lol.

The best part about this show, plot wise, is the surprise ending.  I thought that it was entertaining and I did not expect to find a character of such surprising depth (to avoid spoilers) in a show that is otherwise so stereotypical and shallow.

The physical product itself isn't very special. There are no English on-disc extras of note (no commentary tracks, for example, which is a real shame) and there's no artbox or anything fancy like that.  It's a standard cheapy bluray case from Sentai Filmworks.

Though I would still recommend buying it (as I have) for the dub.  The dub is directed by Matt Greenfield, a man whom I consider to be the best ADR director that Sentai Filmworks has (and a man who doesn't direct often enough these days), and they purposefully ham it up when necessary but convincingly convey emotion when necessary.  There are hilarious accents galore (though notably none for the Chinese character) and the dialogue sounds natural.  The dialogue also flows very well, this dub is one of the minority of dubs that have this, dubs where the illusion is created that the characters are actually talking to one another, that the actors were having actual conversations instead of (as most dubs are) one actor reading his lines by himself.  The English actors sound more diverse and more energetic than do their Japanese counterparts.  In comparison to the English actors the Japanese actors seem wooden, enervated and tired: they're just ""going through the motions (of the parts [they've] learned to play)"" lol.

I will warn you, prospective purchaser & dub listener, that the dub has an overabundance of Japanese honorifics.  IMHO, when foreign honorifics are used to such a degree (as they are here) in an English dub it isn't really a full translation and this irks me as the English language is perfectly capable of representing the relationships that these honorifics are used to describe.  I'll countenance a few honorifics here and there but this has so many that it is basically Pidgin Japanese.

That said, Sentai Filmworks does have some fun with the Japanese honorifics by occasionally appending its own hilarious English ""honorifics"" to names.  I think that almost made up for the overuse of honorifics.

TL;DR: This is a well-dubbed, slickly animated show featuring a rather stereotypical harem + mecha fighting.  It has an ending that IMO makes it all worthwhile but it's the same old stuff till you get there.  I recommend it, nevertheless.",1375056000,,3234,4.794223826714801

Cons:
Not a single con

5036553,5,B006XDU7Y2,"OK, it's predictable, but it's also laugh out loud hilarity (mostly with the situations between our clueless guy and the ever widening harem), cool battles and great animation. The voice work is good, but not great. I swear the German chick was voiced by a person who learned the accent watching Hogan's Heroes, the French accent from watching National Lampoon's European Vacation, and the English accent from Austin Power movies. They were too over the top and not close to accurate.  But you soon get used to them and learn to ignore that idiocy.

Bottom line, it's a fun, entertaining series that goes by way too fast.  It really could have benefited from several more episodes. Nothing was really wrapped up, too many unanswered questions, and the viewer is left wanting more. I guess that's good in a way as you don't feel cheated.  All the characters are almost tragic, and a few has his or her own episode covering their back story. I wished there were more of these, as you really got a handle on the character. After the back story on Laura Bodewig, I switched from ""what a b**ch"" to liking her. Cecilia Alcott - I could take or leave this British royalty scion. No back story, too two dimensional. That's where more episodes would help.

5036558,4,B006XDU7Y2,"Infinite Stratos () is an harem/mecha anime serie set in a futuristic school setting. At first I thought I wouldn't like it; I'm not in the mecha genre and hadn't watched any ""dedicated harems"" before that. Even though some characters might be what you would call ""cliche"", the show still managed to be enjoyable (they used cliches that worked). This isn't a typical mecha show; while there are some mecha fights and it still occupies a good portion of the show, the show also focuses strongly on Ichika and his interaction with the girls (Cecilia, Laura Bodewig, Rin, Houki and Charlotte).

The visuals are pretty well made; it's very common-anime-stylized but it still looks kinda refreshing (I could tell it apart from other anime shows). The backgrounds are georgous and the futuristic-high-school setting is very well represented with depictions of holograms, high-tech, the IS suits and glamorous and highly expensive looking buldings.

When you're going to watch this, do not expect it to have a very good storyline; it doesn't. It's not the kind of story that's going to touch you to the bottom of your heart or anything remotely close to be worth remembering. The show focuses more on the character interactions than the storyline. This isn't a bad thing; you will get attached to some characters of the show. Overall what I mean by this is: watch the show for fun, do not watch the show to criticize the scenario.

**You will most likely find yourself a ""favorite girl"" in Ichika's harem**
**Charlotte is just adorable ^^**

Bluray technical informations: Sentai filmworks really have to wake up and do better bluray menus. The menu is fine, but I would had liked a video or at-least a sound playing in the background when it is shown. Instead, you get a static menu with a picture as a background and you're left to choose which episode to select. While it isn't a dealbreaker, I would had liked to be offered a better presentation; at first I even thought I had a bootleg. There are some extras (radio IS/episode commentaries/etc.) and I haven't watched them yet but I'm looking forward to today. It includes a soundtrack CD and while it is a nice touch I'm probably just going to liscen to it once and that's all.

The english dub is really funny; the girls have different accents depending of the countries they come from. Since Charlotte is french, she will throw in a few french words here and there. And since I'm Canadian French I'm able to understand them all xD.

Overall, I think this show is worth it but watch it for the harem and mecha, not just for the mecha. I think it is really underhyped and criticized too much upon; it's not as bad as some say it is.

Positive points:
-Futuristic set and good art direction
-Charlotte
-Interaction between the girls and Ichika well done
-Every girl has her own Arc (few episodes centered with Ichika and said girl)
-Comes with some extras

Negative points:
-Bluray menus could use some work; presentation aspect
-The ""story"" itself isn't worth remembering",1346284800,,3020,4.772030651340996
5036559,5,B006XDU7Y2,"The vast majority of my anime collection has the word ""Gundam"" somewhere in the title so it is usually shows with a mecha component that I naturally gravitate towards.  The aerial battles were rather astonishing given the limitations of the series (no Gundam-type space battles).  The series as a whole offers some of the funniest one-liners I have heard in a long time, and the overall level of ""funny"" was very high.

What made this memorable for me, though, was how the music coincided with the action in such a fluid manner that I could not imagine watching it without.  To illustrate my point, the series opens with a scene from the last IS battle set to different music than the actual final battle.  The change in music offered such a dramatic difference (literaly, not figuratively) that it truly ""completed"" the scene.  During the final battle, I thought the music fit so perfectly with the animation that I immediately thought of both ""Gladiator"" and ""Transformers"" as a comparison.

My knock on the series is character development.  Even though they did the best job possible given 12 episodes, I would have liked to see just a little more...and slightly less cluelessness from Ichika.  There is PLENTY of material there for a second season, so for now, one can only hope. I highly recommend this series for anyone who both enjoys a good mecha fight and enjoys a good chuckle.",1339804800,,1387,4.794117647058823
5036560,5,B006XDU7Y2,"I pre-ordered this as soon as Amazon listed it, and it came recently. I watched it over three nights, and it was great! The inclusion of a soundtrack CD with the blu-ray discs was also most welcome.

Set in the near future, the basis of the story is pretty standard fare; one guy in an academy full of girls! Add the inevitable childhood sweethearts, girls with guns (or in this case, mecha suits called IS's; the 'Infinite Stratos' of the title) and comic mayhem is a dead cert! Jealousy, tantrums, broken hearts, embarrassing moments involving underwear or swimsuits, and pretty much all aspects of 'anime' life are represented here. The animation and music tracks are stunning; the aerial 'dog-fight' sequences are brilliantly executed, and the technology of the IS's is cool and believable. There is lots of cuteness, and some heart-stopping moments.

The male lead is Ichika Orimura, a 15-year-old boy who is found to be the only male in the world who can pilot an IS. Needless to say, the other pilots, who are all girls, are not happy about this to begin with, but some of them soon fall for him. Just to make matters interesting, it turns out that his older sister Chifuyu is their home-room teacher, and she takes no prisoners!
Throw into the mix former childhood friend Houki Shinonono, who is initially billeted in the same apartment with him. She is not amused about this, and undressing for bed, and the taking of showers, all lead to the inevitable blushes and embarrassment! Initially, she has no IS of her own, and has to make use of a generic 'training' IS provided by the academy, but is later given a new 4th generation model called 'Akatsubaki' by her big sister Tabane, who just happens to be the inventor and designer of the IS concept!
Next is Cecilia Alcott, the English IS Cadet Representative and pilot of IS 'Blue Tears', who also falls for Ichika, as she comes to consider him a strong and worthy opponent.
Then there is Rin Fan, the Chinese IS Cadet Representative, who turns out to be another of Ichika's childhood friends; her IS is called Shenlong, and she is hacked off at Ichika for forgetting a promise he made to her in childhood, but she forgives him eventually.
Laura Bodewig is the German IS Cadet Representative; her IS is called 'Schwarzer Regen' (the German for Black Rain), and is notable for the massive long-range sniper rifle, and rail-gun, it carries. She is not a very 'girly' girl, and following an incident with a bikini, she is overjoyed when Ichika tells her she looks cute in it! For the remainder of that episode, she goes around all starry-eyed, repeating 'He said I voz cute!' when anyone speaks to her!
Last of the girls is Charlotte Dunois, from France, who is the pilot of the Rafale-Revive Custom II IS; she initially joins the academy posing as a boy called Charles, and is billeted with Ichika, but he soon rumbles that she is a girl, after a number of embarrassing incidents involving underclothes and bathing!

The story is cute, fun, heartwarming and lovable, and there are some great IS fight sequences, but ultimately it is the relationships betwen Ichika and the girls that provide the most enjoyable aspect of the series; I totally loved it!
There is a little fan-service, mostly to do with bikinis and the tight-fitting 'undersuits' they all wear when piloting their IS's, with the occasional shower or bathing related scenes providing the rest, but it is certainly not 'fan-service' heavy. I won't reveal the ending, except to say it was very cute, and provoked the inevitable 'Awww!' response!
Also look out for the cute and amusing incident with Houki and Ichika involving a bikini, a night-time meeting on the beach, a (nearly!) first kiss, four other jealous girls and a sword!

Excellent; I hope there will be more in this series!",1338076800,14,3806,4.762121212121212
5036561,5,B006XDU7Y2,"This Series Infinite Stratos Complete Collection Blue-Ray is a very great series to own on blue ray or dvd format. The Music from the cd disc soundtrack has great songs and a great singer from Tokyo,Japan. This series has a great voice cast starring Moncial Rail, Hillary Hagg and a lot of great male and female voice talents who took a lot of hours to make the english langauge track for the production very great for the script. This Series is similiar to the series BubbleGum Crisis Tokyo 2040 and close to the series Heroic Age. I would give this series a five star rating. The cover looks great for the front and the back of the cover. There's a major different between the dvd and blue ray versions of disc. The blue ray version lets you pull up the menu any time when you watch the episodes and lets you change the language anytime. But the dvd version does not give you that same option like the blue ray version. What disappoints me is that with a dvd version you have to go back to the main menu and change the langauge from japanese to english to watch all episodes. If you like a little comedy and sci fi check this series out.",1337990400,,1139,4.327102803738318
