1396002,5,B000055ZKC,"This has to be one the best King of the Rings. This is the first one i've seen. Here is the excellent card for the night.

1. KOTR SEMIFINAL #1 Christian vs Kurt Angle(His first of three matches of the night).This was a nice well paced match. Angle and Christian worked very well together. Shane McMahon comes out and pulls Christian off Angle after the Unprettier. Then Angle does the Angle slam from the apron back in. 7/10

2. KOTR SEMIFINAL #2(Winner faces Angle in the finals)Edge vs Rhyno. This was a great match with again nice moves. This surpassed the last match by a mile. The sunset flip off the top and when Edge went for the spear and Rhyno was looking for the gore at the same were my favorite parts. Great match. 9/10

3. Dudley Boyz vs Spike and his Mystery patner(Kane)(Tag Team Championship). This was a little more than an average tag match. This has a couple power moves mixed in with Spike Dudleyz high flying offense. 6.5/10

4. KOTR FINALS(King of the Ring Champion) Kurt Angle(His second match of the night) vs Edge. This is one of the many great matches these two have had together. Shane McMahon inteferes yet again except this time spears Angle and helps Edge pick up the win with the edgecution. Another great match. 9/10

5. X-Pac vs Jeff Hardy(Light Heavyweight Championship). I personally hate X-Pac so much it's not even funny. In this match I have to give X-Pac his. It's an OK match but if these two had 15 minutes it would be much better than what it was which is OK.6/10

6. Kurt Angle(His third and final match of the night) vs Shane McMahon - Street Fight. This is mainly why I got this video along with the triple threat match and it is nothing less than what I expected and even more. I mean this was awesome. There are no other words to use except for Fanstastic or Spectacular. They didn't use chairs or tables but they used weapons you don't normally see like garbage cans, kendo sticks,glass,a board of lumber,and parking signs. This match deserves triple digits such as 100 but my limit is 10. Angle wins his second match of the night in as what J.R says a slobber knocker with an Angle slam off the top. My favorite part was the belly to belly through the glass. 10/10(MOTY CANDIDATE)

7. Triple Threat match(WWF Championship) - Stone Cold vs Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit. This was not the best triple threat match of all time but delivered with some nice moves. The chair was used to perfection. The ending will definently bring the rating down. Jericho delivered a belly to back superplex. This is where Benoit breaks nis neck. After Austin got up from being put through the announce table by Booker T he pins Benoit snd retains his title. 9/10",1141430400,,2693,4.517453798767967
1396003,3,B000055ZKC,"The ""King of the Ring"" events were ones that I always looked forward to, but this one disappointed me a little bit.  Although there are some really good matches (more on that later), the actual Tournament left a lot to be desired.

1) KOTR Semi-Final Match

Kurt Angle vs. Christian

---This one is a solid entry, but having two heels face off isn't that interesting.  Kurt Angle was still an irritable (but not annoying) character, and Christian was still a cocky prick.  That would've been forgiveable if the match was above-average, but this match isn't.  And is Shane McMahon's interference really all that surprising?  Jim Ross and Paul Heyman talk endlessly about what's going that we stop caring.  It's hard to really get into this one; not a bad opener, but the Tournament has some recovery work to do.

""6 out of 10""

2) KOTR Semi-Final Match

Edge vs. Rhyno

---Rhyno is a hard-working competitor, and really gives his all for this match.  Edge, on the other hand, is one of those guys who's hard to classify.  Is he a high-flyer, technician, brawler...what is he?  It's that confused identity that always makes Edge an inconsistent performer.  These two guys don't really do anything we haven't seen before.  Again, not a bad match, but what hurts this match like the previous contest is that we don't know who to cheer for.  The WWF didn't need to feed us some bogus storyline, but a little direction sometimes is needed to make these matches work.

""5 out of 10""

3) Tag Team Championships

The Dudley Boyz (champions) vs. Kane & Spike Dudley

---This match is very erratic and really is out of control most of the time, but it is fun.  All four men take some good bumps, but this match has odd booking written all over it.  The Dudleyz won the belts three days ago, and Spike suddenly wants a shot at them?  Hmm, a little more build-up and in-ring control would've helped.  Add another average match to the list.

""7 out of 10""

4) King of the Ring 2001

Kurt Angle vs. Edge

---Well, can the Tournament survive?  Will Angle repeat his 2000 victory one year later?  Will Edge's injury (how convenient) cost him the prize?  Well, here goes.  This match still isn't that great, but it is the best of the three KOTR matches.  Kurt Angle is obivously working very hard to get a rise out of the New Jersey crowd (they really hurt this PPV, more on that later), but Edge doesn't do much here.  Lo and behold, Shane-O-Mac shows up (are we that surprised?) and even Christian makes an awkward appearance.  Edge wins with a tainted victory, and ruins Angle's ultimate goal.  Now, Edge has finally earned some respect, but this KOTR made no sense back in 2001.  The King of the Ring was a chance for some new superstars to strut their stuff, but as the years passed, the Tournament became less and less significant.  When we look back on Edge's career, this night probably won't be much of a highlight as it was for The Hart Brothers or Steve Austin.

""6 out of 10""

5) Light-Heavyweight Championship

Jeff Hardy (champion) vs. X-Pac

---Finally, some life is breathed into this mediocre night.  Jeff Hardy and X-Pac give us a fast-paced, high-flying showcase that we desperately needed to see.  This isn't going to go down as one of the cruiserweight classics, mainly because there are some 'convenient moments', but it is a good match with some sweet spots and hard falls.

""8 out of 10""

6) Confrontation

Diamond Dallas Page vs. The Undertaker

---I remember this hype and build-up very well, and I actually thought it was a well-produced and well-played storyline.  But the big payoff at this PPV was disappointing, and still is.  The WWF really could've used this as a launch pad for DDP, but instead decided to make it a beatdown.  Now, beatdowns are okay, but when the punishment ensues for nearly 8 minutes, and is mostly a slugfest, then the payoff isn't worth the wait.  The vengeance of The Undertaker needed to be more brutal and vicious, but instead DDP is a comedic foil who escapes his punishment.  And we were doing so well...

""5 out of 10""

7) Street Fight

Shane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle

---Just when you think that the third strike is about to be thrown in Kurt Angle's future, he and Shane McMahon smack-homerun this one into the Hall of Fame.  This match is a classic!  Everyone has their own take on the other matches on this card, but we all agree on this one.  Believe me people, this is one of those matches like the ""WrestleMania XII Iron Man Match"" or ""Angle/Benoit from Royal Rumble 2003"".  This is one we all love!  Jaw-cracking punches, wicked takedowns, weapon punishment, smashed windows, broken bodies, bloody faces, breath-taking two-counts, and ruthless maneuvers all in one high-octane contest.  You will not belive your eyes when you watch this one, because it has everything from old-school grappling to hardcore brutality.  Every wrestling fan needs to see this!

""10 out of 10""

8) WWF Championship

Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Stone Cold (champion)

---Jericho and Benoit have earned their spot as championship material, but back then, they probably weren't quite ready for this kind of match yet.  But this is the starting point for Jericho's quest for the gold, while Steve Austin and Benoit defintely hold their own here.  Austin's recent turn as a lazy villain actually works very well here, because it's accompanied by his fast fists and brawler style.  Jericho and Benoit, on the other hand, bring that excellent technical prowess than they've always had.  Booker T, then-former WCW champion, makes a shocking appearance, which is a nice addition.  What hurts this match are a few things.  First off, the WCW rumors were starting to go a little overkill.  Benoit and Jericho were obivously given that WCW label because WWF didn't have the confidence in them, just yet.  Another quirk is that the triple threat match often remains a one-on-one struggle.  But what keeps this one from classic status is that this New Jersey crowd just sucks.  Honestly, the WWF athletes had been busting their asses all night, and this audience only came alive during the Street Fight (who didn't?), and barely makes some noise on this carefully-coordinated main event.  Still, this WWF Championship match is one that starts a little slow, but ends on a strong and entertaining note.

""8 out of 10""

OVERALL

---""King of the Ring 2001"" features an outstanding Street Fight, and two very good title matches.  But one of the main draws of the PPV, that is the KOTR Tournament, is the least impressive of all time.  The winner never matters in these events, it's the means to reach the end that WWF/WWE fans love.  The KOTR matches were simply okay.  Plus, the undercard was mediocre as well.  The only DVD Extras on here are two excellent interview segments with Angle and McMahon on their show-stealing Street Fight.  If you can enjoy PPVs that only have few highlights, then pick this DVD up, because a couple of these matches are excellent.  However, if you're a fan who needs most of the PPV to be worth the purchase (like I am), then pass the DVD up, and pick up the VHS version so that you witness the good portions of this PPV at a lower cost.",1139443200,,7188,4.686698717948718

1. The King of the Ring semifinals

Kurt angle vs Christian

The King of the Ring semifinals got underway with defending King of the Ring Kurt Angle facing his friend Christian. Angle went out like a house afire, trying to end the match quickly, because he was facing the possibility of three matches in one night. Soon, Christian got his bearings, and as the crowd chanted ""Angle sucks!,"" Christian started kicking at Angle. Kurt got back to his feet and gave Christian a belly-to-belly suplex, and the match spilled outside the ring. There, Angle continued to pound on Christian, even bouncing his friend's head off the announce table! Christian retaliated and threw Kurt back into the ring, but Kurt shoved him off the ring apron into the security wall! Christian got back up into the ring, where Angle hit him with another two suplexes and went for the cover, which Christian kicked out of.

Winner: Kurt Angle

2. King of the Ring semifinals

Edge vs Rhyno

Edge took on his good friend Rhyno in the match that would determine Kurt Angle's opponent in the tournament final. After the bell rang, Rhyno spat his gum out right into Edge's face! Edge took exception to that, and started slugging Rhyno. The Man-Beast caught Edge with a stiff elbow to stop the barrage, but soon, both men found themselves slugging it out outside the ring. Edge kept taking it to Rhyno, laying him out by pounding him repeatedly into the security barrier around the ring. Rhyno reversed the beating and shoved Edge into the walls. As Edge recovered, Rhyno entered the ring, where he untied one of the turnbuckles. When Edge got back into the ring, Rhyno threw him into that bare turnbuckle chest-first. Rhyno continued to go after Edge's injured ribs, and even locked Edge into the body scissors. After slamming Edge to the mat, he climbed to the top rope and nailed Edge with a huge splash, but Edge kicked out! Edge then laid out Rhyno in the ring, and began to climb the ropes, but Rhyno knocked him down! As Rhyno pounded on him, Edge revered it into an Irish whip, but Rhyno kicked out. As both men stood up, Rhyno went for the Gore at the same moment that Edge went for the Spear! They bounced off each other and lay in the ring in pain! Rhyno went to Gore Edge again, but hit the bare turnbuckle! Edge then hit him with a DDT, allowing Edge to pick up the win!

Winner: Edge

3. Tag Team Championship

Dudley Boyz vs Spike Dudley and Kane

The Dudley Boyz put their newly won Tag Team Championship on the line against their brother Spike and someone Spike referred to as a ""big surprise."" And his partner was Kane!

Spike didn't waste any time, and went right after his brothers. Spike took down Bubba Ray, but the older, and bigger, brother soon crawled away and tagged in D-Von. At that, Spike tagged in Kane. The Big Red Machine laid out D-Von, and took him to the corner where Spike tagged back in. Spike wanted revenge on D-Von for hitting him with a 3D, so he went after him with a fury! Soon, Bubba was tagged back in, and he locked on a sleeper hold, which Spike battled his way out of. Even though he escaped, Bubba nailed him with a powerbomb, flattening him on the mat. D-Von then joined in on the act, and tried to hit Spike with a headbutt, but the runt of the litter escaped and tagged in Kane. Kane took down both older Dudley brothers, and even got two near falls on Bubba. Kane then tagged Spike in, and threw him like a human javelin at both D-Von and Bubba! Spike went for the cover, but Bubba kicked out! Spike tried to pin Bubba after a Dudley Dog, but D-Von pulled him away! D-Von and Bubba hit Spike with a 3D, allowing them to get the pin and retain their Championship! After the match, D-Von went to get the table, but Kane hit him with a powerbomb! Then, Kane tossed Bubba through the table !

Winners and still Champions: Dudley Boyz

4. King of the Ring Tournament Final

Edge vs Kurt Angle

Edge took and his friend Kurt Angle in the King of the Ring final. Before the match, Kurt apologized for getting mad at Edge last week- he didn't want anything to get in the way of their friendship. Kurt told his opponent that he had a Street Fight with Shane, and asked Edge to forfeit, saying it was the ring thing to do! Edge just looked at Kurt and flattened him with a stiff punch! After trading punches, Kurt tossed Edge out of the ring with a belly-to-belly toss! Outside the ring, Angle continued to pound on Edge, going after the ribs he had injured in his previous match against Rhyno. After wearing down Edge, Kurt dragged him back into the ring.

There, he applied a chokehold, and as the crowd rooted for him, Edge slowly began standing up. When he did, Edge started nailing Kurt with punches. He continued the barrage by whipping Angle off the ropes, but Kurt caught him with another suplex. Again, Kurt went after a reverse chinlock, cutting off Edge's air supply. Edge eventually escaped the hold again, but Kurt tossed him out of the ring again! There, Kurt started pounding on his friend, even dropping him on the security wall. The referee told them to get back in the ring. Back in the ring, Edge took down Angle with a hurricanrana. When Edge went for the pin, Angle kicked out. On their knees, both men slugged it out. Once they got back on their feet, Kurt locked on the ankle lock, but Edge reversed it! When Edge went for the pin, the referee was distracted when Christian ran out to ringside! Kurt again locked on the ankle lock, and Edge tapped, but the referee was distracted! Kurt went to grab the ref, and Shane McMahon ran to the ring and speared Angle! Edge got up and hit Kurt with the Impaler, getting the win and becoming the 2001 King of the Ring!

Winner and King of the Ring 2001: Edge

5. Light Heavyweight Championship

 Jeff Hardy vs X-Pac

Jeff Hardy put the Championship on the line against X-Pac. The match began with both high-flyers pounding on each other, but soon, Jeff gained the advantage, locking on X-Pac's arm. X-Pac reversed the hold and tossed Jeff out of the ring. X-Pac flew at Jeff with a springboard, and then pushed him back into the ring. There, X-Pac nailed Jeff with a spinning heel kick, and started pounding on him on the corner. When he went to hit the bronco buster, Jeff rolled away! Utilizing the advantage, Jeff started pounding on X-Pac, even hitting him with a corkscrew! Jeff went back up top, but X-Pac caught him and rolled through, gaining a near-fall! X-Pac nailed Jeff with an X-Factor, and the ref counted to three! He then realized Jeff had his foot on the rope, so the match continued! Jeff climbed up to the top rope, hit X-Pac with a Swanton Bomb to retain his Championship!

Winner and still champion: Jeff Hardy

6. Street Fight

 Kurt Angle vs Shane McMahon

The Street fight between Shane McMahon and Kurt Angle began with the Olympic Champion pounding the WCW Owner to the ground! Kurt kept pounding on Shane until Shane retaliated with quick punches. Angle kept going, however, and hit Shane with some more right hands and a belly-to-belly overhead throw. Angle took Shane to suplex school tossing the Boy Wonder around, and then nailed him with some forearm chops. When Shane stood up, Angle got down on all fours and challenged him to beat him amateur-style. Shane hovered around the Olympic Champion, but instead of agreeing, Shane kicked Angle in the side! The match soon spilled out to ringside, where Shane climbed up on the barrier behind JR. and Paul. When Angle went after him, Shane jumped right over the announcers and took down Kurt! The WCW Owner picked up a kendo stick and started pounding on Angle! As Kurt lie down trying to recover, Shane stopped to take a breather. It was then that Angle jumped on Shane from behind! Shane escaped, however, and started pounding Kurt's head off the ring steps. Shane pushed Kurt back into the ring and went for a cover, but Kurt kicked out! Shane climbed back out of the ring and started getting out some weapons - garbage cans and street signs! Shane started smacking the Olympic Champion with the signs, and went for another cover, which Kurt reversed out of!

But, Shane reversed that and put on the Ankle Lock, which Angle barely escaped. Shane then put Kurt in the Sharpshooter! Angle screamed as Shane held on! Kurt was able to grab a kendo stick to free himself before he had to tap out. Shane went after a garbage can and started slamming it over Kurt Angle's head. When Kurt was lying in the ring, Shane put the can on Kurt's chest and began climbing the ropes. He got to the top rope and went to do the Shooting Star, but Angle moved! Kurt went for the pin, but Shane kicked out! The brawl spilled outside the ring again, and Kurt started beating Shane up the entrance ramp. There, he nailed Shane with another suplex! After pounding on Shane some more, Angle suplexed Shane right into the King of the Ring stage, bouncing Shane's head off the floor! Angle went after him again, and tossed Shane through the glass set! Both men were bleeding after being cut by the glass, and Angle tried to suplex Shane through the glass two more times, and then he threw him through it head first!

As Shane was bleeding profusely, Angle went to pin him, when he was informed that the match was not falls count everywhere - he had to pin him in the ring! Kurt grabbed a travel case and put Shane on it and began wheeling him to the ring! When they got there, Kurt put Shane in the ring and covered him, but Shane kicked out! Angle grabbed a garbage can lid and set Shane on his knees, but Shane hit the low blow! Shane started nailing him, and then hit him with the Angle Slam! Shane was able to put his arm over Kurt, but Angle kicked out again! It was then that Kurt went for the Ankle Lock, but Shane was able to escape! Angle grabbed a piece of lumber and started pounding on Shane, and then propped the board as a platform! He and Shane stood on the platform on the top rope and Angle slammed him into the ring, where Kurt pinned Shane to win the match! After the Street Fight, the crowd gave Shane McMahon a standing ovation as he left the ring.

Winner: Kurt Angle

Great opener. Shane McMahon helps Angle win the match? I'm confused. ***3/4

Good match. Probably the best that you would get out of the two. Edge wins. ***

Dudley Boyz (Champions) V. Kane & Spike Dudley

Little above average match. Dudleys retain. **3/4

Kurt Angle V. Edge

Good match but nothing like their matches in early 2002. Edge wins because of Shane McMahon? ***1/2 Wait a minute. I see what Shane is doing. Shane was just making Angle wrestle two matches befor their Street Fight later. You think?

WWF Lightheavyweight Championship:

Jeff Hardy (Champion) V. X-Pac

Good match but it could have been alot better. Hardy retains. **3/4

Street Fight:

Kurt Angle V. Shane McMahon

Simply awesome. It was slow paced at first but it picked up in a big way. Match of the night easily. Bleed, Sweat, and Tears litteraly in this match. The reason why I got this DVD was because I heard so much about this match and it didn't disappoint. Angle wins with the Angle Slam...off the top rope! Easy ***** match. I am making a list of my top 100 matches on WWF/E Pay-Per-View and I have 20 5 star matches on them. It may seem like alot but out of all the matches since the first WrestleMania, I only gave 25 of them 5 stars and 20 of them were on PPV. I hope that tells someone who hasn't seen this match how good of a match this was.

Threat Threat Match foe the WWF Championship:

Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion) V. Chris Benoit V. Chris Jericho

I actually think this was a great match. I think people were a little worn out after the Street Fight and that is way the crowd wasn't really into it. Austin retains. ****

Match #1 KOR Semi-Finals Kurt Angle vs. Christian: Decent match, but nothing spectacular. This was the start of Shane's devious plan to screw Kurt into wrestling 3 matches. Shane helps Kurt win after screwing Christian out of a pinning victory. kurt wins and advances to the KOR finals. 7/10

Match #2 KOR Semi-Finals Edge vs. Rhyno: I actually liked this better then the first match, eventhough Christian and Kurt are far better talents then these two. Edge wins with his flying DDT thing and advances to the finals. 8/10

Match #3 Spike and Kane vs. The Dudleyz (c) for the WWF Tag Team Championships: Kane was Spikes mystery partner. The coolest part of this match was when Kane military presses Spike and throws him into the dudleyz on the outside. After a tough effort, the Dudleyz end up retaining. Not bad but I've seen better. 7/10

Match #4 KOR Finals Edge vs. Kurt Angle: Kurt tries to convince Edge to forfeit cuz he knows he is gonna lose to Kurt anyways and that Kurt has to wrestle in a third match later on. Naturally Edge doesn't do that and the match is on. Phase 2 of Shane's evil plan comes into effect and he screws Kurt out of being the only person to win KOR two years straight. Edge is the 2001 KOR!!! Great match!  8.5/10

Match #5 Jeff Hardy (c) vs. X-Pac for the WWF Light-Heavyweight Championship: I think this is one of the last times this title was defended if I'm not mistaken. Didn't watch this entire match, but Jeff Hardy retains. X-Pac wins the title the very next night on RAW, haha! 5/10 but Jeff still RULES!

Match (well sort of) #6 DDP gets the hell beat out of him by the Undertaker: What a horrible storyline...this totally disrespects both of these guys if you ask me! Plus Taker's wife is UGLY and anorexic looking, and I don't see why anyone would ever stalk her, even to get to the top of the business...LAME! 2/10 for the beating!

Match #7 Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon in a Street Fight: AWESOME!!! Kurt shows here how awesome he really is for going through that many matches in one night, especially this brawl! He is a phenominal athlete (as JR would say)! You can't deny how awesome Shane o' Mac is too. He gets knocked so silly in this match, it's sick! This match is too awesome to describe and is probably going to go down as one of the WWE's greatest (and brutal) matches of all time! You have to see it! 100000000/10!

Match #8 Y2J vs. Chris Benoit vs. STone Cold (c) for the WWF Title: A lot on the line here. If Austin loses his partnership with Vince is over and it was rumored that Benoit or Jericho would defect to WCW if they won. This is where Benoit really hurts his neck and is out for a year after this match. You can see the pain he was really in. I truly believed if he wasn't injured, he would have won the belt in this match! Booker T also makes his WWF debut here attacking Austn and slamming him through the Spanish Announce table. Great match but a crappy ending for obvious reasons. Austin retains. 10/10

This gets a 57.5/80! Borrow this for the last two matches, but don't buy it! Thanks!",1111017600,,3227,4.408403361344538

Kurt Angle vs. Christian

Very good way to start things off.  Fast pace and good technical wrestling.

Edge vs. Rhyno

So-so.  Edge has come a long way since this one.  Nothing special but not that bad either.

Tag Team Championship

Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley & Kane

Not that good at all.  Two big blown spots by D-Von really killed this.

Lightheavyweight Championship

Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac

Pretty good match.  Not as bad as people say.

Undertaker/DDP

Not a match just an ""encounter"".  I'm not sure why they didn't just have a match.  Taker just beats on DDP.

Street Fight

Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon

WOW!!!  In perhaps the greatest street fight ever these guys really put their bodies on the line.  This match has everything, wrestling, brawling, and high flying.  Some of the sickest bumps this side of Mick Foley.  Just amazing!!

Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho

Very long but also very good match.  They were finally giving new people a chance to main event.  This is the match that put Benoit on shelf for a year.  Great match.",1106697600,,1148,4.67005076142132

1396021,5,B000055ZKC,"I've reviewed this before and gave it a three because there is some mediocre stuff and that is the wrong rating, the best match I've ever seen is the street fight. I've read a review(not on Amazon)and he/she said that it does not get interesting until like 16 mins of the match(just before the big bump to shane), that person must not be a technical or proper wrestling fan. The first 6 - 7 minuits of match is the best to me because you get to see Kurt do a fake irish(pull him by the hand/arm)wip into a belly to belly over head throw, gut rist into slam and more grappling moves. Shane is not very talented at wrestling so he does some fake punches, uses a kendo stick then things start to heat up again when he does an amazing shooting star press of top rope(while Kurt holds the trash can).

That is the best match I have ever seen and this is a must own DVD. Watching Kurt now he is not as good as he was in 2001(he's getting up to middle age I think). Kurt grow some hair if you haven't. I hope the WWE bring out a DVD with Kurt angles best matches like Chris Benoits DVD.",1093824000,,1079,4.089622641509434
1396022,4,B000055ZKC,"King of the Ring 2001 went from an ok PPV to a good PPV because of one great, amazing match.

1. Kurt Angle vs. Christian (King of the Ring Semifinal)

The first of Kurt's three matches of the night.  Good opener.  The crowd was really into it from the start.  Interesting to see two heels wrestle.  The other two King of the Ring matches involved two heels.  Good match.  (8.5/10)

2. Edge vs. Rhyno (King of the ring Semifinal)

Good match.  Nothing too exciting.  Good spot with the double spear attempt.  (8/10)

3. Dudley Boys vs. Spike Dudley & Kane (WWF Tag Team Championship)

Again nothing too exciting.  Typical Dudley's tag match.  The addition of Kane brough something a little extra too the match because he was a surprise partner.  (7.5/10)

4. Kurt Angle vs. Edge (King of the Ring Final)

Good match, although these two would later go on to have some classics.  Interference by Shane McMahon was pretty exciting.  (8/10)

5. Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac (Lightweight Title)

What could have been a great match was slow, boring, and very choppy.  They just didn't work good together.  (6/10)

6. Undertaker vs. DDP

This was actually not a match, just a confrontation that turned into a fight.  Basically, the Undertaker just whipped DDP from pillar to post.

7. Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon (Street Fight)

Angle's third match of the night.  Amazing match.  One of the best I have ever seen.  Shane, as well as Angle, put themselves through hell.  There are some amazing high spots in this match.  Watch for the Angle Slam off the board on the top rope.  Watch the kid in the light blue shirt in the backgroud chanting after the move.  He makes the move more exciting.  (10/10)

8. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit (WWF Title/Triple Threat)

Okay match.  I think these three could have put on a much better match.  Pretty exciting sequence with the Crossface and Walls of Jericho at the same time.  History happened in this match as Booker T interfered and the WCW/ECW invasion began.  This is also the match in which Chris Benoit hurt his neck.  (8/10)

Good extra feature with the opinions of Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon on the Street Fight.

1396023,3,B000055ZKC,on this DVD there're mostly bad matches then good. The worst thing on this is the UNDERTAKER getting revenge on DDP and is just UNDER punching and kicking DDP. Just like SURVIVOR SERIES when there's 1 good match(Aliance against WWF)the only match I watched like 20 times was the street fight because it has one of the best wrestlers at the time(Kurt Angle)and a good highfliyer/bumptaker(Shane MacMahon). Who said all Wrestling is fake when they both got hurt bad by shane getting belly to belly suplexed(thrown)into a window twice and once did not go through and Shane injured his head. They both got back in the ring and a few minutes later Kurt got a board and put it on the top corner turn buckle and ANGLE SLAMMED Shane of it. At the end SHANE gets a standing ovation for those bumps and his high flying moves.,1090022400,,815,4.551020408163265
1396024,3,B000055ZKC,"King of the ring was one of the most interesting ppv the wwe had.
Some of the best matches of the year happen at this event like Foley vs Taker (hell in a cell) and there have been some of the worst matches of the year in the kotr like the hardcore evening gown match with patterson and brisco, kiss my foot match with Bret Hart and jerry lawler and Too much vs al snow and head.  This King of the ring unlike the majority of them had more strengths than weaknesses.  The tournament actually had some real wrestling take place and it wasn't a 3 or 4 minute worthless filler that we've seen in the past years. In fact I think it's the best tournament since the first one back in 1993.  Kurt Angle definately earned more of my respect by competing in 3 matches and all 3 matches were top notch.  Angle tourney matches might have been a little better if Shane hadn't of interfered in both.  The Street Fight was awesome.  I would have never though Angle would've wrestled good in this type of match.  Angle overhead belly-belly suplex on shane through the kotr entrance which was made of glass was brutual.  The angle slam of the top rope was cool too.  The main event was pretty good up until the end.  Booker T's interference was cool until a month later we discover that they were on the same side all along.  Taker-DDP encounter was absoultely stupid.  Taker just kicked and punched DDP throughout the encounter.  X-Pac vs Jeff Hardy was decent and the tag team match b/w kane and spike vs Dudleys were average too.  If I bought this tape, I would only watch the tourney matches and the street fight basically.",1078272000,,1611,4.398648648648648
1396035,4,B000055ZKC,"When WWE fans think of the King of Ring PPV's, they automatically think of the 1998 show because of the Mankind/Undertaker ""Hell in a Cell"" match. While I really enjoyed the 1998 show, I almost enjoyed the 2001 King of the Ring more. The main reason why this PPV was so good was because of Kurt Angle. He competed in three matches over the course of the night. The best match of the night, and my favorite match of all time would have to be Kurt Angle vs Shane McManon in the Street Fight. The match was excellent from start to finish. The most shocking thing about the match was seeing Shane being thrown though glass not once, but twice in a row!! Shane did a great job despite the fact that he is not a full time wrestler. The thing that made Kurt Angle so impressive, was the fact that it was Kurt's third match of the night. He got better as the night went on. The other great match of the night had to be Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit. It started out slowly, but picks up speed and becomes a very good match. Another highlight of the night was seeing Booker T make his WWE debut.
Overall, I can only give this PPV 4 stars. Aside from the Kurt Angle matches, and the last match with Jericho, Benoit, and Austin, the rest of the card was pretty mediocre. The PPV is definately worth owning and you will be entertained. But, don't expect King of the Ring 2001 to be well rounded.",1078012800,,1409,4.241635687732342
1396036,2,B000055ZKC,"Meadowlands East Rutherford NJ Continetal Airlines arena. The event would prove to be a big waste of $75.
Most of the matches came off as very boring and dissapointing. The Taker/DDP was ok, and the Spike/Kane vs the dudleys was good, but for the most part it was really boring. The best match of course was the Shane vs Angle. I forget the outcome but when Angle tried to throw him through the glass windows that were the set for King of the ring, the first attempt failed and the glass didn't break and Shane hit the floor really hard. It's pretty dissapointing when the best match features a non wrestler! I was also dissapointed by the main event in which Jericho and Benoit basically 'swam' around the outside of the ring for like 10 minutes, way to kill time! The only thing that saved that match was a suprise run in.
I'm not sure what's on the DVD, but hopefully it's not as boring as it was live.",1066521600,,905,4.3609467455621305
1396037,1,B000055ZKC,"Now I noticed that most people are actually reviewing this as a good KOR and one thing comes to mind when i read a review like that for a ppv like this and that would be have you considered brain surgery? I mean c'mon Benoit suplexes Jericho and they both take a 3-hour nap in the middle of the ring and then Austin wakes up from his nap and crawls in the ring and puts his arm on Benoit and wins? I am sorry to say that I was one of the unfortunate victims that ordered that on ppv and let me tell you, when Austin pinned Benoit and actually got a 3 count I was very pissed. I had just been screwed out of 30 bucks and was obviously in a very bad mood after what had just happened. Anyways, I would just like to say that it's endings like that, that can put a ppv or an entire company out of business and this ppv did put the KOR out of business but the WWE can at least be thankful that this no good piece of possum crap didn't force the entire company to go out of business.
PS:If you are considering buying this pathetic excuse of an event I would just suggest throwing 30 bucks in the sewer instead of wasting any gas money to go to the mall and buy this joke.",1062633600,,1165,3.940677966101695

Kurt Angle vs. Christian-Great opening match. Christian is really underrated
Edge vs. Rhyno-I didn't have much interest in this match, it was boring and I think Rhyno is nothing but a hardcore wrestler
Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley and Mystery Partner-No interest in this match either. A pretty boring tag match. The Dudleyz are overrated
Kurt Angle vs. Edge-Good talent in the ring, match could have been better but it was pretty good
Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac-Both these guys are great wrestlers but the match could have been 10 times better than it was
Undertaker confronts DDP-Undertaker destroys DDP, decent segment
Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon-UNBELIEVEABLE! Without a doubt the best match on the card and one of the best street fights I've ever seen. UNBELIEVABLE!
Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit- Slow to start out but once it gets going its a damn good match and ths starts the WCW Invasion.
Good PPV with a solid card from top to bottom. King of the Ring 2001 I would reccommend if you are in for a good match like Angle vs. McMahon and the Triple Threat for the Title.",1060732800,,1315,4.6

It was one of the best streetfights of 2001, and I love it. Angle suplexes poor old Shane McMahon through two glass walls and gives him an angle slam from the top turnbuckle in the corner of the ring! Oh, my gosh! This match is da bomb!!! Fans of hardcore wrestling won't be disappointed. Stone Cold Steve Austin takes on Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho in an awesome triple threat match for the WWE Championship. Watch for Booker T to interfere in the match near the end and slam Austin through the Spanish announce table. Chris Benoit suffers a career threatening injury during this matchup as well.

1396072,5,B000055ZKC,"I own this event on DVD and I have to say that this is the best King of the Ring. The matches were all awesome matches and some of my personal favorites.
The DVD extras are few but the DVD is still worth the money. The extras are Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon's commentary/interview on their match. Kurt Angle is out of character but Shane is in character.
Heres the card:
KOTR Semifinals:
Kurt Angle vs. Christian ***1/2
-Great match with lots of technical moves by both competitors. Angle and Christian tear eachother apart and deliver and awesome KOTR match.
KOTR Semifinals:
Rhyno vs. Edge ****
-My third favorite match of the night. Rhyno is a great competitor. Rhyno used lots of submissions and Edge uses lots of great offense as well.
WWF Tag Team Championship:
Dudley Boys(c) vs. Spike Dudley & Kane ***
-Nothing really special here. The thing I don't get was the WWF really had a great tag team divison at the time but used one of the oddest looking teams out of all of them. This match is okay and is better than some Tag Team Title Matches in recent weeks.(cough.cough. Hogan and Edge..cough)
KOTR Finals:
Kurt Angle vs. Edge ***1/2
-A great match with Angle and Edge suplexing eachother for most of the time. Edge wins a hard fought victory with the help of Shane O' Mac.
WWF Lightheavyweight Championship:
Jeff Hardy(c) vs. X-Pac ****
-Both deliver an awesome match. Lots of high flying moves and the ending was something to watch.
Stalker Confrontation:
The Undertaker & Diamond Dallas Page ?
-What is this?? Fast Forward when this shows up. The only con of the whole PPV. Why this confrontation couldn't be held on Raw still remains a mystery.
Street Fight:
Shane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle *****
-This match got the audience back in the PPV after the 5 minute slugfest of The Undertaker and DDP. Lots of amazing moves that still amaze me to this day. Angle delivering the Belly to Belly Suplex through the glass was the something to behold. Followed up by a Super Angle Slam made this match the Match of the Year.
Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship:
Steve Austin vs Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit ****1/2
-A great feud that delivered one...of a match. Suplexes and high flying moves left and right. But Austin came out on top with his Stone Cold Stunner to still be WWF Champion.",1027209600,,2300,4.61219512195122
1396073,5,B000055ZKC,"The 2001 WWE King of the Ring was awesome.  The KOTR (King of the Ring)tournament was exciting and the best part of this Pay Per View was that there was no regular match.  In every match there was somethig on the line, either the chance to become the King of the ring or the WWE title or there was some kind of special match.  There was no normal one on one match which gaurantees every match is gonna be exciting.  Here are all the matches and how they were.....
#1 KOTR Semifinals: Christian vs Kurt Angle- Great opening match match.  Real exciting because there was a time Christian had control over the match but lost it because of Shane McMahon.
#2 KOTR Semifinals: Edge vs Rhyno- Good match between two freinds.  The great part of the match was Rhyno doing his Gore and Edge doing his spear at the same time to each other.
#3 WWE Tag Team Champioship: Dudley Boyz vs Spike Dudley & Kane- A good tag title match.  It was great for spike because it was the first time he fought his brothers on a ppv.  Plus what happened after the match was awesome.
#4 KOTR Finals: Kurt Angle vs Edge- Another great match between two frends.  Kurt Angle proved he had what it takes to become the King of the Ring but in the end it was Edge who was the victor mainly because of Shane McMahon's interfearence.  Because of that, the upcoming Street Fight between Kurt Angle and Shane Mcmahon became more exciting to see.
#5 WWE Light Heavywieght Championship: X-pac vs Jeff Hardy- good match between two lightheavyweights and the ending was not dissapointing.
#6 Confrontation: DDP & Undertaker (not a match)- For weeks DDP was stalking Undertaker's wife all because he wanted to become famous and the Undertaker was being driven crazy not knowing who it was .  And now that he knew, it was time for him to unleash all his fury on him which was exactly what he did.  So many weapons were being used and Taker sure did make DDP famous.
#7 Street Fight: Kurt Angle vs Shane McMahon- For weeks, Shane McMahon had been making Kurt Angle's life a living hell.  McMahon had accused Kurt Angle of stalking Taker's wife which Taker took really seriously on Kurt.  And after costing him the KOTR, Kurt must have really been looking foward to this match.  Well hte match was real good.  Lots of weapons, brutality and blood was in this match.  Shane was even thrown threw glass (More then once!!)The Angle Slam of the top rope was sweet.
#8 WWE Championship Triple Threat match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Y2J (Chris Jericho) vs Chris Benoit- An Awesome match considering the fact that Benoit and Y2J were friends and double teamed against Austin and that the whole rivary started when Benoit & Y2J took the tag titles from Steve Austin and HHH.  The match was great because Y2J and Benoit eventually fought and weapons were even used and Benoit even his Stone Cold with a Stunner!!!.  A great thing was that WCW Champion Booker T made his debut in this match and did something very cool to Austin 3:16.  Although good stuff happened the ending of the match was dissapointing.
As you cn see all the matches were real good and exciting.  i gaurantee anybody who buys this will love it. GET IT!!!!",1026777600,15,3170,4.516637478108581

1396075,5,B000055ZKC,"I was at this event and let me tell you that it was incredible to see it live.  Owning this DVD allows me to go back and relive these incredible memories I have.  The ppv tournament was shortened which allowed for longer/better matches. Here's a run down of the matches.
Semi-final 1: Kurt Angle vs. Christian - This is the perfect example of what an opening match should be.  They got the crowd pumped and put on a good show.  The Angle Slam from the outside of the ring in was a sweet variation.
Semi-final 2: Edge vs. Rhyno - These two are terrific wrestlers with unique styles.  This match had great psychology and the double-spear was definitely a cool site.  They will both become big-time players some day.
Tag-Team Title Match: Dudley Boyz (champions) vs. Kane & Spike - This was a typical tag-team match.  Spike Dudley took some cool bumps.  It was akward because this match was thrown together at the last minute and the Dudleys had just become heels.  The chokeslam through the table was what the crowd wanted. =)
King of the Ring Finals: Kurt Angle vs. Edge - A very memorable KoR Finals match-up.  Another match between two great wrestlers.  The belly-to-belly suplex over the top rope was awesome.  The Christian interference was a little confusing.  However, Edge winning was perfect because the crowd was rooting for him and he deserved it.  The Shane interference built up even more tension for the Street Fight.
Light Heavyweight Title Match: Jeff Hardy (champion) vs. X-pac - A decent match with nice-looking moves.  The ending kept the crowd happy and the rest of the ppv moving along nicely.
Confrontation: Undertaker vs. DDP - This was pretty pointless.  It's pretty boring and probably the KoR's only major flaw.  You'll probably want to skip this.  However, DDP sitting in the front row with his sign all night long was pretty funny.
Street Fight: Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon - Needless to say, if you're even considering this buying this dvd/video, you've heard about this match.  This was one of the most brutal WWF matches ever.  I'd go into detail, but I think the surprises of this street fight have to be seen to be believed.  I will say this, though... Shane and Kurt both left King of the Ring with a lot of REAL injuries.
Main Event - WWF Title Triple Threat: Stone Cold (champion) vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit - The main event  can only be described as the perfect way to end a perfect evening.  These three fought for close to a half-hour (as did Shane and Kurt) in a match that went on a total roller coaster.  This match had it all except for a dramatic finish, but that can be forgiven.  What a night!
EXTRAS: The 2001 King of the Ring DVD is certainly lacking in extras compared to other WWF DVD's (I have two others).  However, the two interviews that are there are the most incredible special features on any WWF DVD.  Shane and Kurt talk you through their street fight.  However, they don't talk in character.  They let you know what they were really feeling and how painful it really was.  I might recommend this DVD for these interviews alone!
Overall King of the Ring 2001 was an event that certainly made it's mark.  I can seriously recommend picking yourself up a copy of this DVD.",1015372800,3,3235,4.593368237347295

We get to see Shane go through the staging glass (twice) and we get to see a shooting star press by Shane and an unbelivable Angle Slam from the top rope.

1.) King of the Ring Semi-Final: Christian vs Kurt Angle

Nice opening match to kick off the show. Shane McMahon, who Kurt Angle would meet later in the night in a Street Fight, got involved near the end and confusingly cost Christian the match, allowing Angle to get the win on Christian with an Angle Slam to advance to the finals

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) King of the Ring Semi-Final: Edge vs Rhyno

A great brawling match here that was better than expected. Midway into the match, Rhyno works over Edge's ribs for the remainder of the match, that Edge sells to perfection. Edge, bruised ribs and all, gets the win with the Edgecution on Rhyno after Rhyno accidentally Gores an exposed turnbuckle

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The Dudley Boyz (c) vs Spike Dudley and Kane

Not a bad Tag Team match. Spike claimed to have a mystery partner and it turned out to be no one other than the Big Red Machine, Kane, who got a great pop from the crowd. These 4 work through this match very well with each other and even Spike was impressive. In the end, The Dudleyz retain after Bubba pins Spike, following a 3D. Kane and Spike get the last laugh however as Kane attacks D-Von with a powerbomb and Chokeslams Bubba through a table following the match

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) King of the Ring Finals: Kurt Angle vs Edge

This was a solid bout between these 2. I love Kurt Angle vs Edge matches. They're always so exciting to watch back in the day. Angle cuts a hilarious pre-match heel promo on Edge, asking him to forfeit the final match so he's fresh in his Street Fight against Shane and to spare Edge the embarrassment of getting beat by Angle. Edge responds with an attack on Angle to get the match started. While this was nowhere as great as the matches they had the following year in 2002, this one was still a good one to sit through. After the referee gets accidentally knocked down, Shane runs through the crowd and takes Angle out with a spear. Edge capitalizes on a stunned Angle with an Edgecution to win the match and become the 2001 King of the Ring.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Match: Jeff Hardy (c) vs X-Pac

Didn't really care for this match because X-Pac was in it and I was never a fan of X-Pac or most of his matches for that matter. X-Pac got a nice serving of X-Pac heat from the New Jersey crowd in this one. Jeff retains with a Swaton Bomb on X-Pac in the end to retain

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Unsanctioned Fight: DDP vs The Undertaker w/Sara

This all started when a masked man stalked The Undertaker's wife Sara for weeks in their home and on their property. The masked stalker turned out to be WCW's DDP. This all lead to this unsanctioned fight between the 2. It was rather a waste of time as Taker just beats DDP on all 4 sides of the ring before DDP escapes through the crowd. It was rather sad to see that a former WCW World Heavyweight Champion was now being used as Undertaker's punching bag. I'm sure Vince got kicks and giggles out if though

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs Kurt Angle

In what may very well be the best match in King of the Ring history (behind Mankind vs The Undertaker in 1998), this was a pure classic that any wrestling fan will love and is a recommended must-watch for anyone getting started into watching wrestling. These 2 beat each other from pillar to post in this brutal and breath-taking back and forth Street Fight. Perhaps the most memorable moment of this match is when Kurt Angle belly to belly suplexed Shane through the designed glass of the stage, twice! Kurt Angle failed at getting Shane through the glass both times, but got it on the second attempt. Angle takes the victory close to the 27 minute mark after giving Shane an Angle Slam off a wooden board that was wedged in the corner of a turnbuckle. Shane was left a bloody mess and the fans wanted more! Angle may have won the match but on that night, both men were the real winners for putting their bodies through perhaps the most brutal Street Fight in WWF/WWE history

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWF Championship Triple Threat Match: Chris Benoit vs Chris Jericho vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

This was a great main event match to close out the show. All night long there was a rumor swirling around that if either Jericho or Benoit won the title, they'd defect to WCW with the championship. All night long, Stone Cold desperately awaited the arrival of Vince McMahon, whom Austin was depending on to help him retain his championship. Remember that this was heel Stone Cold who had sided with Vince McMahon and depended on him to help him in most of his situations involving the WWF Championship. Jericho and Benoit teamed up to take out Austin a couple of times throughout the match and would then beat up each other. I enjoyed this main event and it lasted quite a while, reaching almost 30 minutes. This match is best remembered for Booker T making his WWF debut, who attacked Austin near the ending of the middle of the match with a Scissors Kick before plowing Austin through the Spanish announce table. Austin retains the title with a pin on Benoit after a back suplex off the turnbuckle

Overall: This is the second best King of the Ring PPV with the 1998 King of the Ring being first. But this PPV was extraordinary. The King of the Ring tournament and the WWF Championship match had great build while the preliminary matches came in between. The best reason to buy this DVD is to see the amazing Street Fight between Shane and Kurt and even the main event bout.

Kurt's 2nd match was against Edge in the Finals of the King of the Ring and it was a heart-pounding,even,entertaining bout. The Light Heavyweight title match between Jeff Hardy & X-Pac was a high-flying,entertaining bout and a good reminder of the good years of WCW's crusierweight division. Kurt Angle's 3rd match in a streetfight against Shane McMahon and it was a bloody,hard-hitting,smash-mouth,ECW-ish brawl.

7931585,3,B000055ZKC,"King of the Ring 2001 - this will take you back to the transitional period between the Attitude era and the sports entertainment era. Otherwise known as ""The Invasion.""
Back in 2001, WCW was bought out by the WWE (at that time WWF), so of course, the inevitable WWF vs. WCW storyline began. The King of the Ring helped kick off this angle, but mostly, this PPV is predominantly your standard WWE event.

There were some good moments throughout the card, but quite a few skippable moments too. Throughout the event was the feud between The Undertaker and Diamond Dallas Page. Their storyline involved DDP stalking Undertaker's wife, Sara, with a video camera, using the footage to taunt the Undertaker. The motivation here was for The Undertaker to ""make DDP famous."" I don't know, this storyline didn't sit right with me. Maybe it wasn't executed right, maybe it wasn't right for a wrestling storyline, maybe it was just tasteless.
Throughout the event, there were promos with DDP at ringside until finally The Undertaker came out, they had a boring and slow brawl around the ring for a few minutes before DDP left the arena. We didn't even get to see a Last Ride or a Chokeslam. It would have been more interesting if it was an actual match, it at least would have seemed like it was building up to something.

Of course, King of the Ring is famous for its tournament, the King of the Ring tournament has been crucial stepping stones in the careers of a lot of King of the Ring winners such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Bret Hart and Kurt Angle.
The two semi final matches were between Christian and Kurt Angle, which was decent. It was short and sweet. If they were given more time, they could put on an excellent match, but even so, it was a decent opener. Shane McMahon became involved adding to the match. The other match was Edge versus Rhyno, which was physical and quite brutal. Edge did a good job of selling in this match. From the semi-finals, both Angle and Edge moved onto the final.
There was a tag team championship match between The Dudley Boyz and Spike Dudley with a mystery partner. *spoiler* The partner turns out to be Kane, I guess they forgot to book Kane (the Intercontinental Champion at that time) in a match so they threw him in here. The match was average, ended in a 3D. But we got to see Kane chokeslam Bubba Ray through a table after the match.
The King of the Ring Finals match was decent, Edge and Angle can put on some great matches. Edge ended up winning and becoming the King of the Ring winner, with help from Shane McMahon.
Jeff Hardy defended the Light Heavyweight Championship against X-Pac in a decent match that served mostly as a time filler. X-Pac dominated a lot and did a lot of high risk moves that seemed to make him seem more like a face in this match, although I doubt he much of a fanbase going for him. The fans were, as always, behind Jeff Hardy. Decent match with some decent moves.
But the real reason that you should buy this DVD is for the Shane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle Street Fight. It was built up perfectly and pulled off just as well. The match was brutal, and I doubt there's a WWE fan alive that doesn't remember the footage of Shane McMahon getting belly-to-belly suplexed through a sheet of glass. And I also have to admit, Kurt Angle was very impressive here. He wrestled two moderately long and fast paced matches earlier in the night and he was still able to go through a street fight that nearly lasted half an hour.
There were a lot of great spots, and a lot of extremely painful and brutal looking moves like the aforementioned suplexing through glass, the uninhibited use of a kendo stick, a brutal shooting star press and probably the biggest Angle Slam (from the top rope) I've ever seen. This makes the DVD worth buying and the pay-per-view worth watching. My only critcism of this match would come from the fact that at the time, the WWE seemed to be trying to push the WCW as a face company, as well as Shane O'Mac as a face, and pushing Kurt Angle as a heel. But the fact is, for years the WWE had been promoting the idea that WCW was the devil, so of course, the fans seemed very mixed as to whom to root for. Kurt Angle, the guy that's meant to be a heel, or Shane McMahon, the guy that runs the company that everyone hates? But in reality, this is only a minor criticism as the match as a whole is excellent.
The main event is a triple threat match between Steve Austin, Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. The WWE were lacking somewhat in star power at this time since The Rock had just left for the first time to try and begin his movie career, and Triple H had just been sidelined with an injury that would leave him out of the ring until 2002. But this all isn't necessarily a bad thing, as Jericho and Benoit finally began to get a push that they deserved. The build up to the match was good. While the match wasn't perfect, it suffered from some slow patches that seemed to leave the crowd a little bit restless, it was overall a good match and a decent way to end the event. Booker T made a brief appearance attacking Austin outside the ring. The ending of the match was a bit anti-climactic, but still, it's a decent match and it kept up with the standard that Shane McMahon and Kurt Angle set beforehand.

Overall, King of The Ring 2001 is okay. It's not the best pay-per-view but if you do happen to see it, I'd still recommend buying it. Shane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle is an excellent match and probably worth buying just for that. The main event is also good, but other than that, there aren't too many major highlights. Kurt Angle vs. Edge is also good but this is a pay-per-view built around three things: Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon's feud amongst Kurt Angle's attempt to become the King of the Ring; DDP and Undertaker's storyline that isn't all that great; the WCW and WWE background behind the show.

Christian VS Kurt Angle: A good opener but nothing speical. Christian had the match won but Shane McMahon pulls him from the ring. The finish was cool as Angle pulled Christian from outside in the ring with angle slam and the win.

Kurt Angle VS Edge: Edge wins after Shane O'Mac helps out.

Jeff Hardy VS X-Pac: Should have good but something felt off.

DDP VS Undertaker: I think DDP is a great worker and was misused by WWF/WWE. It was just a beat down. The invasion angle did have some good matches but for the most part, fans hated it.

Kurt Angle VS Shane O'Mac: The only reason to get this bad PPV. An awesome street fight and both men worked well together. If you love hardcore matches, this will not disappoint.

Steve Austin VS Chris Beniot VS Chris Jericho: Slow paced, sloppy. The match could have been done in ten minutes or less but it dragged out. Booker tries to cost Austin the title but like I said, the match was slow. The ending was stupid beyond words.

7931587,4,B000055ZKC,"The street fight between Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon stole the show on this night. They had in my view one of the best, if not the best, street fights in WWE history. Another thing to point out is that the KOR started the Invasion feud between then the WWF and WCW with Ecw.

Before the semi-finals got underway of the tournament, Diamond Dallas Page opens up the show to address the crowd to what he did to the Undertaker and his wife Sara over the past couple of weeks. He soon pleads to the Undertaker to ""Make Him Famous"" and then takes a seat in the front row.

1. KOR Semi-Finals
Kurt Angle vs. Christian
This was the first of 3 matches Angle competed in during this night. Christian and Angle had a solid opener. They had a good match in the ring and a nice little brawl on the outside. Shane comes out and helps Angle to score the pinfall over Christian to advance in the KOR tournament. 3.5/5

2. KOR Semi-Finals
Edge vs. Rhyno
This is another good match up in this tournament. Rhyno and Edge had a good fight going on on the outside. They had a very good, competitive match in the ring as well. Theres a point in the match where both Rhyno and Edge trys to hit the spear/gore and they just tackle the hell out of each other. Pretty good match up. 4/5

3. Tag Team Titles
Dudley Boyz vs. Kane & Spike
Kane turned out to be spike's mystery partner for this match. This was a good tag match. Everybody looked very good in this one. There were a couple of good spots dealing with Kane and spike. It had a very sweet counter from the dudley dog into the 3d. It also had a good table spot after the match where Kane chokeslams buh buh through one. 4/5

4. KOR Finals
Edge vs. Kurt Angle
This last match in the tournament was the most competitive one out of the three. They had a good wrestling contest in the ring with some nice counters and wrestling moves. Shane would also interfere in this match but only this time to screw Angle in becoming the only 2x KOR. Edge and Angle would go on to have better matches in the future but this is one to watch. 4.5/5

5. Cruiserweight Title
Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac
Another good match up. Hardy was more of the high flyer in this one while X-pac stayed more to the ground. Pac was more trying to wear down Hardy than using high risk where Hardy was. A good cruiserweight match. 4/5

Undertaker vs. Diamond Dallas Page
After viewing footage of DDP being stalked throughout the night, this is the point in the ppv where Taker makes his enterance to proclaim into making DDP ""Famous"". I wouldn't say this is a match at all, this was just a beat down from Undertaker to ddp to what ddp has done to him in weeks beforehand. Just a another segment to set up the Invasion feud and to give Angle more time to rest up for his street fight.

6. Street Fight- Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon
This match is what stole the show. It looked like this was Angle's first match of the night, even though he wrestled 2 more matches prior to this one. There was everything in this match from weapon use, wrestling, submissions, and high risk. Once it got taken to the outside, Shane gets belly to belly through one glass wall and thrown through another. Shane gets real bloody in this one and he also displays a great deal of heart in this match. It had an unbelieveable finish with Angle angleslamming Shane from the top rope. Phenomenal match, match of the night and maybe of the year. 5/5

7. WWE Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho
This is the match where the Invasion from WCW truly began. This is also where Benoit really hurts his neck which forces him to stay out for a year.

It seemed in the beginning Benoit and Jericho were going to team up and take out Austin. There were a couple of very good spots of one on one action with Benoit vs. Austin and Jericho vs. Austin. Austin seemed as he was the under dog in this match even though he was the champ. Jericho and Benoit would tie it up for awhile as well. Booker t would make his debut in this match and drive Stone Cold through the announce table. A match that had a lot of great action. A very solid main event to begin the Invasion feud. 5/5

KOR is a good event to pick up if you like the KOR tournaments. The whole year of 2001 was a very surperb year and KOR is no exception.",1223769600,,4299,4.243276283618582

7931589,3,B000055ZKC,"This was a rarety in that the actual King Of The Ring tournament that highlights this PPV was nothing more than a filler compaired to everything else that was going on in WWF at the time and was just an afterthought once the PPV ended.  This PPV was important for actually kicking off the WCW invasion angle as we saw the debut of the WCW Champion, saw the WCW ""owner"" involved heavily in matches throughout the night, and saw a match that foreshadowed the direction that the WCW vs. WWF storyline was going.

Kurt Angle vs. Christian - This was the first of two semi-final matches in which they booked two heels against each other but the bigger story here was about Shane McMahon costing Christian the match so Angle would have to wrestle another match before his street fight with Shane.

Edge vs. Rhyno - Another heel vs. heel match that was missing that ""it"" factor that makes a good match. Watchable but they seemed off here.  A highlight to watch though was the spear & gore delivered at the same time.

Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley & Kane - This was just a filler match on here as Spike picked a partner to go against his brothers who turned on him weeks earlier...and Kane was the partner.  Match was good & actually better than the pervious two matches with everyone taking some big bumps.  But look out for the ending as Kane delievered a sick chokeslam to Bubba Ray.

Edge vs. Kurt Angle - The King Of The Ring final was the best match in the tournament but they would go on to have better matches a little under a year later.  This was one of those ""put a storyline over matches"" in that Shane McMahon cost Angle the match to continue the build up for their street fight later on, Christian interfeared & looked like he tried to cost his brother the match which would start their ""jealously"" storyline.  Again, it's not the best match between Angle & Edge but the highlight is that Edge is the new King Of The Ring which began his single's run in WWF.

Lightheavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy vs. X-Pac - This was one of those ""paint by numbers"" matches as Jeff Hardy was just going from spot to spot while X-Pac tried to make this look like an actual wrestling match.  It wasn't that good but compared to the other matches thoughout the night, it was above average.

Undertaker confronts ""Diamond"" Dallas Page - The storyline was built up very well as DDP was stalking Undertaker's real life wife & when it was revealed as DDP from WCW, that only added to the anticipation.  However, this was that match that I said earlier foreshadowed how the WCW invasion storyline would go.  Undertaker completely SQUASHED & DESTORYED Page for almost 10 mins. before DDP ran away though the crowd.  One of the rare WCW main event superstars to come over to WWF for this angle was made to look inferior to a WWF superstar and the month long hype for DDP was killed in 10 mins.  Overall, this is good for those who just like seeing a beatdown but besides that, it was the beginning of the WCW burial called the ""Invasion"" storyline.

Street Fight: Shane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle - This match was one of the matches of the year as these two delivered such an amazing performance that it ended up injuring both men for at least a month afterwards.  This had something for everyone's taste.  Brawling, weapons, high impact moves, storytelling...and even some amature wrestling.  To this day, when you see the ""Don't Try This At Home"" advertisement on WWE DVD's, most of the highlights on there come from this match.  Again, a modern day classic.

WWF Champion Stone Cold vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit - This match stars off a little slow but continued to build up into something special & tells a good story here between these three as you know you are rarely disappointed in a performance from any of these 3 men.  The bigger story here was the WWF debut of WCW Champion Booker T who put Stone Cold though a table & hurt him to the point where he was out of action for a month.

Overall, the King Of The Ring tournament didn't live up to it's height while it was the other matches that saved this PPV from being a disaster.  But the main event & street fight alone make this a PPV that I would get...but only at a low price.",1178755200,,4240,4.445736434108527
