1963350,5,B0000ZFZYG,Awesome episodes from Yugioh and great to watch to see Yugi and the dark Magician on action with another but a dark red version of him. Great to see them go head on with another one almost as good as them. And to see the new Dark Magician GIrl card for the first time in the show. You will have a good time watching these episodes.,1370822400,,331,4.03030303030303

1963353,5,B0000ZFZYG,"The Master of Magicians Saga is my favorite saga in the whole series! Yugi gets kidnapped into an underground dueling spot. There, he meets Arcana, an evil magician who challanges Yugi to a duel. And not only does Yugi have his favorite card and Millenium puzzle on the line, if he loses an energy saw will send him to the shadow realm. During the duel, Arcana is easily taking out Yugi, and when Yugi summons the Dark Magician, Arcana summons another, even stronger, Dark Magician! In the end, we know that little Yugi wins again, but this was one of the most intense duels ever.",1072742400,8,580,4.533333333333333
