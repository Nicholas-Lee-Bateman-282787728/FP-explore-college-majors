8133733,5,B000GP0UA4,"This is a super great PBS Special from the early pioneers of rock n' roll, that you will enjoy. Especially if your a ""Boomer"" The memories will ""flood back"" of where you were as you listen to so many groups perform there hits. I've watched it repeatly, it makes a good ""party video"" to get your friends up dancing and singing.",1261699200,,326,4.360655737704918
8133734,3,B000GP0UA4,"This DVD completes the show that was represented on Rock and Roll At Fifty.  Most of the DVDs of these shows do not present the entire show, only the best numbers.  In THIS case, I can understand the wisdom of the editors in presenting what they presented on the first DVD, as many of the songs on the More DVD have the original artistes, but not their original voices: in other words, time and age have not been kind to them.  It was nice to see Bo Diddley, but painful to see that he could barely stand up, what to speak of play.  These DVDs are valuable for preserving the music, but I think it would be better that some of these artistes be remembered for how they sounded in their heyday.  But that is not the DVD maker's fault.  What their fault is they stretch a show out to two DVDs, and you have to buy them both if you want to have the entire show.  Then you find out WHY the first one was like IT was. It would be better if they could put out the DVD of the entire show.",1220227200,4,981,4.025773195876289
