8258537,5,B0015I2SL0,"I still hope to see it in person but life has a way of getting away from one so I thought a DVD might be a good alternative to travel.  Indeed, this one was.  Not only do you get great views of the Wall but also the history of it through the ages and the various incarnations of it during the different dynasties.  I would highly recommend it for anyone intrigued by the subject or the history of China.",1382918400,2,403,4.075949367088608

8258539,4,B0015I2SL0,Excellent quality.  Interesting documentary of the building of China's wall.  I like the way the film was enacted as it might have happened.  Perhaps some shots of map graphics would help to spotlight the locations of China and Mongolia.,1264809600,,237,5.0256410256410255
8258540,5,B0015I2SL0,"Koch Vision presents ""CHINA'S GREAT WALL"" (2006) (100 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Built over 2000 years ago as a military fortification, the Great Wall of China remains one of the most impressive man-made structures on Earth --- This two-part documentary, shot in stunning HD, presents the ancient technology, history, and mythology of China's enduring symbol of strength.

The title can be a little misleading: --- China has many great walls --- The earliest parts of it date to around the 2nd century, BC, (Han Dynasty) and look nothing like the great wall that immediately comes to mind, which was built starting in the 14th century, AD (Ming Dynasty) --- The earlier was simply made from earth and straw, layered and stamped down within wooden forms --- The Ming wall was earth and brick. All of it was made with slave labor which, just for the record, isn't cool.

China's Great Wall dispenses this information using reenactments, current footage, and occasional but sparing interviews with experts on the subject.

The wall has been around for centuries, and the Chinese are pretty used to it --- They've carved holes in it to make their lives easier and have taken to keeping livestock inside during inclement weather --- By contrast, early Western visitors were amazed by its majesty.

China's Great Wall is a two-part documentary that tells many tales well. I like that its roots are in reenactment; it helps to aid in understanding for visually oriented learners.

Great job by Koch Vision --- looking forward to more high quality titles from the BBC Collection film market --- order your copy now from Amazon or Koch Vision where there are plenty of copies available on DVD, stay tuned once again for top notch releases --- where they are experts in releasing long forgotten films and treasures to the collector.
