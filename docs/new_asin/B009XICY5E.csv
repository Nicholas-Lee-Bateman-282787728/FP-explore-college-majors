5371156,5,B009XICY5E,"Korea has an amazing Cinema industry.  Like the United States there's lots of fluffy boy-girl silly movies, some overly violent ones but there are real masterpieces, stories told beautifully.  This is one of them.

I could have titled this review, ""From Selfishness to Selflessness.""

I believe the original title of this in Korea was ""My Gangster Lover,"" which does not do any justice to the beautiful story told here.

I'm not going to go into many details -- just some of my impressions. Just know that what you're getting here is a beautifully told story.

Jeong Yu-mi and Park Jong-hoon are perfect for their roles. Dong-chol Oh (Park Jong-hoon) is a middle-aged gangster who finds little fulfillment in his life. Sae-Hin Han is a young woman of promise who, having grown up in the country, gets her first professional job in Seoul. Unfortunately the company goes bankrupt, her boyfriend leaves her for a job somewhere else and she's forced to find cheaper rent in a poorer neighborhood.

She soon finds she has moved next to an exasperatingly selfish man.  When he walks out to see all her stuff outside and asks why nobody's helping her move in she tells him the movers wanted extra for that.  Dong-chol expresses outrage that they wanted extra money for moving in, saying they must be a bunch of jerks (or something of that nature). Sae-hin's eyes light up with hope as she realizes her next door neighbor is outraged and now she will get some help.

It doesn't happen. As Sae-hin watches in disbelief, Dong-chol simply walks off and leaves her to the task, still muttering under his breath about how selfish these movers are.

You get the picture. She has to live next to this guy! And it gets worse before it gets better!

So what this movie is about is a guy who can feel empathy but just doesn't quite get that maybe he should be involved in the solution sometimes.

I love the way, writer/director Kim Kwang-sik weaves, in essence, 3 endings to this. The first is somewhat sad, but fulfilling. But wait, there's more. Still sad, but happy and you know that's the end. But wait!  Oh, wow! Amazing!

Let me just say that Jeong Yu-mi's slow-motion smile at the end makes watching the movie to the end worth it!",1366761600,16,2220,4.656410256410257
5371157,4,B009XICY5E,"The title makes the movie seem like it would be quirky, but it really isn't. The development of the relationship between the two main characters is gradual & believable. I like how it is not written to be a perfect, man-meets-woman & they fall in love immediately cookie-cutter dialogue. It's just refreshing in its simplicity & reminds us that love is unexpected & imperfect. Give this film a try. You will like it.",1366675200,8,416,4.712328767123288
5371158,2,B009XICY5E,"Been working my way through Amazon Prime free movies, from Korea, Taiwan and Japan. This one started out with a job loss and a guy getting beat-up, so I didn't finish it. It may be a great movie, but if I'm not caring for the characters in the 1st 20 minutes it's over.",1363219200,,269,4.09433962264151

5371167,3,B009XICY5E,"Without giving away the storyline, this is a very subtle movie that punches you in the face at times and is so subtle that you will miss stuff if you are not paying attention.

The male lead is great and gets his ass handed to him in most every ""fight""...

The female lead is also cute and well-acted and has more patience than most people. I'm glad to see her thrive and finally get respect in the end.

The final scene is ""weak sauce"" and needs one more final scene.

Use your imagination about what happens at the end. What is the deal with everyone constantly smoking? Don't they realize they will get lung cancer? Idiots!!!

Good luck and enjoy!",1449964800,,650,4.383333333333334

I was really apprehensive about watching this movies thought it was going to be about drugs, sex and killing only. But it is really a clean movie with more morals in it than you would think. It is inspiring and I loved the way the movie turned out. The plot, the actors and the whole movie was excellent. I am so glad I watched this movie and you will not be disappointed. It also shows you that you can not quit in life because as soon as you quit that is when you lose not the opposite. I love this movie and it was so touching and inspiring.

I never liked Park Joong-hoon's face, and never understood his popularity until I saw this movie: he is the male lead.  This is a fast-paced, belly-laugh comedy with perfectly timed punchlines.  By the end of the movie, you will fall in love with the characters.  Many Korean movies are rated NR, which does not give enough information.  There is one scene where the couple sleep together, but there is no show of nudity or sexual act.  In American Rating, this should be somewhere between G and PG13.",1421884800,3,581,4.693069306930693

5371191,4,B009XICY5E,"Amazon's synopsis is surprisingly inaccurate. I would not use the words ""lighthearted"" or ""wacky"" to describe this film at all, nor is it in any way a comedy, thought it's not without humor at all.

Also, be warned that as is too often the case, Amazon has screwed up the aspect ratio of the Instant Video presentation. Presumably this wouldn't be a problem with the DVD, but it will be if you're watching online.

Besides Amazon's inept marketing of this film, there's really nothing else to complain about, and lots to like for the viewer looking for a thoughtful romance off the beaten path.

Se-jin has worked hard to distinguish herself in her ""country"" university, landing a job in Seoul. Dong-chu did prison time for his boss, and is hoping to be rewarded with the management of his own bar. The two meet when Se-jin's employer goes bankrupt, putting her out of work and living in a cheap apartment next to Dong-chu.

In a way, these two are both ""losers"", though not due to any fault of their own. Se-jin is repeatedly underestimated by would-be employers because of her second-class schooling and lack of experience, while Dong-chu is aging in a criminal organization which has taken advantage of him. Perhaps Dong-chu's limited career movement is a result of his fundamentally honorable nature; whatever the case, Se-jin's appearance in his life is creating subtle pressure for him to reevaluate his life.

Having met, love blossoms, ever so gradually.

My only real complaint about the movie is that the ending seems straight out of a Hollywood focus group, as if they'd seen a different version of the film and talked the writers into another direction. It is exactly this kind of storyline incongruity in American cinema that is why I enjoy watching the better foreign films. So I felt a bit let down in that respect.

But otherwise, the rest of the movie is really well done. Park Jong-hoon conveys his character's difficult tension between the gangster life he's familiar with and the possibility of something more. Jeong Yu-mi superbly portrays a young woman with strength, but still learning to deal with a professional world that is disrespectful at times.

Even better is the writing, which gives us genuinely human responses to conflicts and dilemmas. Dong-chu's tools for problem-solving are mainly rooted in violence, yet he eventually manages to use this blunt instrument to help Se-jin in a time of need, without making things worse for everyone (the usual and likely outcome). These characters are navigating a messy world, in their own messy way, as best they can.

In the end, it's a story with heart and loveable characters, and that along with the skillful production makes for a very enjoyable movie to watch.",1409356800,,2739,4.911255411255412

Instead, My Dear Desperado is a tender story of longing, compassion, struggles, and most importantly, tentative love. The twist at the end made me smile.
