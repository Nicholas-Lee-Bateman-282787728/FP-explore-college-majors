1215744,3,B00000FZL2,"This is an okay film about mind control, but nothing special.

Willem Dafoe is a Frankenstein-type scientist.  Actually, he's even more like Dr. Jekyll.  Like both of those classic ""mad scientists,"" Dafoe is a gentile idealist who believes he can perfect man.  Like Jekyll, he hopes to eradicate evil from men via a drug.  So he gives it to ex-con Ray Liotta.  Naturally, things go wrong

Another reviewer pointed out the unlikely romantic pairing of Ray Liotta and Michelle Rodriguez.  I agree.  Liotta looks like a rough member of the working poor.  He applies for work at a car wash, where the much younger Rodriguez, a community college student, is immeadiately attracted to him.

Yeah, right.

Another annoying aspect of this film is that, while it's set in the US (Liotta's cover is that he's from Cinncinnatti), the film is SO OBVIOUSLY shot in a European city.  The cobblestoned streets, the traffic signs, the architecture of the buildings -- it's SO OBVIOUSLY not the US.

The credits reveal that the film was shot in Bulgaria, so I guess the film was shot in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.

That's not a crime, and the film remains interesting.  But still, it's annoying, making it harder to suspend disbelief.",1113696000,2,1222,4.830917874396135
1215745,4,B00000FZL2,"An action/thriller movie, ""Control"" is an entertaining film that follows a young guy who just got off death row with the condition that he volunteer to take part in a test experiment for a new drug. This new drug makes a person feel guilty for past actions and makes them more mellow and non- violent. What better place to test it than at a death- row prison?

Ray Liotta plays the main part in this movie, and he is quite good. He is violent and unpredictable, and you never know what he will do next. One second, he seems like he is losing his violent nature, presumably because the doctor, played by Willem Dafoe, has succeeded with his recipe for this special medicine. Then, out of nowhere, he flips out and goes on a violent rampage, striking everyone around him with his bare fists.

Control is suspenseful and fun. You keep guessing what will happen at the end, and you will likely guess incorrectly. Will the medicine successfully make this former murderer change his ways and become a productive member of society? Or will the ex- killer resume a life of crime once he hits the streets. You don't really know until the movie is near completion.

Not everything about this movie is perfect, and it's certainly not the best of its genre available on DVD. But it is still a good movie, and it's one that has received very little coverage. I didn't even know it existed until I saw a notice of newly released DVD. I never saw a preview for it or heard anything on television about it. It is a basically obscure title, even though it's only a few months old.

Overall, Control is a good film, and most people will at least appreciate its originality and its unpredictability. It's no substitute for some of the great action films, but it is still pretty good, with solid, convincing performances from Liotta and Dafoe.",1113436800,,1823,4.565749235474006
1215746,4,B00000FZL2,"Ray Liotta is a crazed killer who could be classified as a murderous psychopath with absolutely no conscience.  He mows down people without a blink of an eye.  We see him going to death row to be executed.  The movie kind of reminds me of la femme nikkita then, because he gets a choice. If he wants to live, albeit a new identity, he is to be put on a seratin based experimental medicine to determine if violent people can be turned into compassionate, functional citizens, remove the evil tendencies and live a normal life.  Well you can watch and see what happens, but in my opinion Liotta took this character from despicable to having me actually feel for him.  Willem Dafoe was excellent also.",1111190400,,698,4.552
1215747,4,B00000FZL2,"I was really anxious to see this because both Ray Liotta and Willem Dafoe are in it, and I think they are great actors.  They both are really good in this movie.

Ray Liotta plays a death-row inmate who is given a second chance by a Pharmicuetical company, who has their scientist played by Willem Dafoe, give Liotta drugs to chance his personality and turn him from being a criminal into being a ""nice guy"".

The story line and script were really great. I thought the concept of the story was fascinating. This story would have made an outstanding psycological thriller. But it was kind of a cross between a thriller and an action movie.

The only thing that got to me was the age differences between the actors and actresses. For example, Ray Liotta is 50. Michelle Rodriguez is 27, and I felt to young to play his love interest. I hate when movies do this. Maybe they were trying to appeal to the younger male crowd and not only did they add the car chases, but they chose a young actress. But it really sticks out like a sore thumb, especially when I thought everything else about the movie was so good.",1111190400,,1107,4.411764705882353
1215748,4,B00000FZL2,"If it were possible, I'd give this 4 1/2 stars. I love this genre, and this film was a real surprise. Very solid story and acting. Willem Dafoe plays a doctor working for a pharmaceutical company that is trying to do research on a new anti-psychotic drug. Ray Liotta is a killer on Death Row with seemingly no remorse at all for his victims, one who he's left not dead, but brain damaged. He is about to be given a lethal injection, when he is offered a chance to participate in this drug study. Surprisingly, it is not an easy choice for him, but one he does choose reluctantly. With the care of his doctor (Dafoe), he takes the medication, and talks of his life and childhood (he saw a boyfriend of his mother's callously strangle her to death when he was 10 years old).

Finally after taking the medication for awhile, Liotta is allowed to re-enter society, where he gets a job at a car wash and he and one of the other workers (Michelle Rodriguez) fall in love.

I will stop here, but suffice it to say that you will not guess the plot of this. It is very smart. Definitely will keep you entertained and provoke thought; recommended highly.",1110153600,2,1144,4.3915094339622645
1215749,5,B00000FZL2,"Control stars Ray Liotta, Willem Dafoe, and Michelle Rodriguez. Control is one of those movies that hardly anyone knows about yet. It's very strange that a movie this good was not talked about more before it's release. It's one of those rare movies that leave you thinking, why have I never heard of this damn movie?

Ray Liotta plays a violent sociopath convicted of murder. This performance shows Ray Liotta at his darkest, craziest, and most violent. Liotta plays this character so convincing that it is just plain shocking. He always plays a psycho perfect, but this is by far his best ever.

Control moves at a real steady pace. The story gets more interesting as the film goes on, and after a while you find yourself right in the middle of a damn good thriller. Liotta has great chemistry with all of the other characters, but it's most evident with Dafoe. There is a scene where Ray Liotta is actually crying while Dafoe is hugging him.

Every aspect of this movie is impressive and the only flaw is in the story. So if you want to see Ray Liotta give a powerhouse acting performance, or you just want to see a remarkable thriller, this is the movie to see.",1110067200,,1164,4.533333333333333
1215750,5,B00000FZL2,"i was a little surprised to see that a movie this good hadn't been advertised more. awesome acting all around, especially from ray liotta and michelle rodriguez. the plot was completely original from what i can tell. i haven't seen another movie where this has been done before.

this is how it goes, a man gets a second chance after being put to death, but has to participate in a behavioral modification drug research program. his attempts at escaping are cut short, but after proving himself as nonviolent, they release him into the general public with taking their precautions of course, but then his past comes to haunt him. there was a nice couple of twists and an awesome but sad way of finishing it up. i am not going to spoil that. just take a look at this movie if you get the chance.",1109980800,,794,4.475862068965517
1215751,5,B00000FZL2,"This is another movie that fell through the cracks and was never released in theatres. A real shame since I thought it was very good. Ray Liotta turns in another fantastic performance to add to his wonderful career. I agree with what the first person wrote in their review its worth atleast a rental. However, I went ahead and bought it without really knowing anything about it and I'm glad that I did.

I love Ray Liotta and just about every movie that he is in is worth it. The guy is simply a great actor and no matter what films he makes I'm almost positive that I'm going to like. Get this movie you will not be dissapointed everyone in the cast does a great job as well. Willem Dafoe is very good as the doctor that is trying to help Ray's character become another person. Even Michelle Rodriguez who I had never seen before this movie is quite convincing given that she has a small role. She is also very pretty I thought.

Anyway give this movie a chance and you will like it. Get CONTROL and see for yourself.",1108684800,2,1018,4.296875
1215752,4,B00000FZL2,"This is a movie that went largely unnoticed and has been bumbing around for quite some time.  Ray Liotta stars in this gripping thriller as Lee Ray, a sociopathic killer serving time on death row. He is secretly given a rare second chance when the brilliant Dr. Miles Copeland (Willem Dafoe) offers to use him as a test subject for a new drug designed to squelch violent tendencies. Lee agrees, and they go through the motions of lethal injection, and the former criminal assumes a new life with a new identity. Soon, however, things start to go horribly awry; Lee starts to become haunted by his violent past and doesn't know if he can maintain his control.

Liotta is wonderful in this film giving one of his strongest performances since Goodfellas.  Co-Stars Steven Rea and Michelle Rodriguez as Lee's girlfriend.  A nice little psychological thriller.  The DVD is in 1.85 aspect widescreen and features one short making of feature and trailer.  Worth a rent at least.",1108425600,12,971,4.819277108433735
1215803,4,B00000FZL2,"Hardcore prisoner and unrelenting sociopath Lee Ray Olivier, (played by the fantastic Ray Liotta) is put to death by lethal injection.  When he wakes up again inside the morgue, things get weird for him.  Dr Michael Copeland (the fantastic Willem DaFoe), a Neuro-pharmacologist, is in the final stages of testing his newest drug - on humans.  Oliver is offered a chance to participate or go through his execution for real.  He agrees, but he's far from the perfect patient.

At first he's atrociously violent, attacking guards and attempting escapes, but gradually the drug begins to work.  Oliver's tattoos are removed, preparing him for the final test - a normal life in public.  Dr. Copeland's dream is to take a violent offender and turn them into an average, everyday Joe.  Copeland makes sure Oliver knows, ""You're only alive because of me.""  Gradually, Oliver calms down and begins to exhibit rational thought.

Released to work and live in a normal environment while wearing an ankle bracelet, Oliver meets Teresa (Michelle Rodriquez) and they become friendly.  But, can a sociopath actually become an empathetic person?  Can a conscience develop if it wasn't present before?  This movie has quite a few twists to it that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  Ray Liotta's transformation from the murderous killer to the pacifist is a landmark in his acting career, one of his best performances ever.

While not as violent or graphic as 'Strangeland', another film of experimental pacification of monstrous personality disorders, 'Control' is still a very good movie.  My primary complaint is that the DVD did not have English subtitles for the hearing impaired, so crank the volume up.  Enjoy!",1176854400,2,1706,5.057347670250896
1215804,5,B00000FZL2,"To start off, I originally bought this movie only because it had Michelle Rodriguez in it (I'm basically in love with her). It turned out to be an awesome movie, I was actually moved by the ending (which I won't give away, but it almost made me cry).

It was kind of short, and Michelle's part in it was relatively small when compared to her other movies. I think this is the only movie where I was amazed by Ray Liotta, and William DeFoe was impressive as usual.

Well worth your time, and a perfect movie to nag your friends about who have never even heard of it when you tell them how great it is. Plus you can get it real cheap, there is no good reason not to pick this one up.",1159833600,4,681,4.074626865671642
1215805,2,B00000FZL2,"Though I'm a huge fan of Ray Liotta buying this DVD was a mistake. Just rent it.. there is nothing extraordinary in this movie to watch over and over again.

As to the movie itself. The idea is not new but still has a lot of potential. Unfortunately writers of the script did a very poor  job in everything.. dialogues, characters development and plot twists that are really idiotic.

Liotta and Dafoe are trying deliver some acting but horrible plot leaves completely disappointing feeling.",1134777600,2,491,4.821428571428571
1215806,5,B00000FZL2,"This movie probably isn't worth 5 stars but for an unheard of movie I only picked up for Ray Liotta and Willem Dafoe, that ended up being pretty good, now that's rare. I mean, how often do you pick up a movie that you've NEVER HEARD OF, with an unheard of director and end up loving it? Barely ever!

Control is a thriller with a highly creative plot and with some seriously awesome acting by Ray Liotta. I am a huge fan of his and he was fantastic in this movie. Don't believe me? Just watch this movie then! Watch his facial expressions, especially when he's playing thta video game and blowing away all of the cops.

The movie is about a criminal (Ray Liotta) convicted of numerous murders who instead of beeing put to death, is able to be one of the tests of a new drug proposed by a doctor (Willem Dafoe). This drug is supposed to be able to transform criminals, making them feel pity and remorse about what they've done. From one day to the next, this criminal is changing, crying, and is nice. He is put out in the real world to see how he will manage. What will hapeen? Well, you'll just have to find out! The ending is great and a good exclamation point on a great movie. The movie also happens to have its touching moments that made me think...a lot. It goes into the head of a psycho, and shows his human side. Why did he become who he did? This movie gives all the explanations, explanations probably true for most people like this one.

Well, for a different movie with an original plot (similiar in originality to Unforgettable's) and a good leading performance, with some good thrills and even sweet moments, check this unheard of movie out.",1129593600,19,1656,4.387622149837133

So, the killer is released and given the pill, but told that if he is recognized the project is over and he goes back to death row.

The acting is good, the story is pretty solid, but I had one problem with the story. A research company that is testing out a top secret new drug that could make millions would have enough sense to know that they can't have a supposedly executed killer walking around the city unnoticed. His execution was suppose to be front page news, how can he just blend into normal society? Still, worth seeing.",1124582400,2,724,4.362962962962963
1215808,4,B00000FZL2,"CONTROL poses the question of whether or not a sociopathic criminal can do a complete turnaround and become a useful member of society?  Perhaps so if this conversion is chemically induced.  That's the premise of this well done thriller.  Ray Liotta does a smashup job as a convicted killer whose execution is staged in order for him to become a guinea pig in an experiment by Willem Dafoe (who is excellent as well).  ALthough initially the drug doesn't seem to be working, in time, Liotta expresses remorse over the shooting of a young innocent bystander who subsequently became little more than a child after the brain injury.  Convinced of Liotta's redemption, Dafoe releases him and gets him started on a whole new life, including a romance with his spunky co-worker (well played by Michelle Rodriguez.)  Of course, it isn't long before external factors seem to propel Liotta into a life of crime.  This includes the vengeful brother of the man Liotta wounded.

Crisply directed by Tim Hunter and propelled by Liotta's performance, CONTROL has some surprising twists at the end that answer the question of the conversion.",1121731200,2,1126,4.983957219251337
1215809,4,B00000FZL2,"Ray always plays a great psycho! I liked the story alot,

alot of action throughout the movie, so it doesn't get
boring. I never heard of this movie, but I'm glad I saw

1215810,2,B00000FZL2,"'Control' begins with a great opening, and poses a very intriguing question -- Can we save someone's soul with medicine?  Can we make someone, say, a convict in Death Row come to truly regret his past deeds, and wish to start a new life by giving him some small pills?  And what if the two leads are played by two character actors Ray Liotta and Willem Dafoe?

Sadly this interestng story is fatally damaged by the awfully muddled script.  Yes, the opening section is brilliant.  Ray Liotta is Lee Ray Oliver, convict sentenced to death, waiting for the time to be executed, and we are closely watching the last moments of his life.

But someone, or some medical company offer an unexpected help.  If Lee Ray agrees to receive the medical tests for the new medicine they are working on, he will be secretly transported to their labo where they are doing research for the effects and side-effects.  The immediate manager of the experiments is one Dr. Copeland (Dafoe), who is hired by the company's more powerful superior played by Stephen Rea.  In addition to Liotta, Dafoe, and Rae, Michelle Rodriguez and Polly Walker join the cast.

The film is fairly strong in the first half, but in the second it gets confusing and even pointless at times.  The biggest problem is the role of Lee Ray, whose character is too flat to take his seriouly.  Casting Liotta works to some extent, for he could be very unpredictable with ease (like in 'NARC'), but in this film his character undergoes changes too suddenly -- it looks as if we are watching two movies, one with bad Ray and the other with good Ray.

However, these things could have been much less harmful if Tim Hunter refused to rely on the typical B-action formula (and this was in fact shot in Bulgaria, land of B-movie location).  Russian mafioso sends out a killer who looks exactly like a hitman that Lee Ray can spot him in the crowd.  The company's black suits, while they are supposed to be watching Lee Ray, lose sight of him simply because ... they couldn't find the parking space.  And as to the two ladies, they have nothing to do except that they provide slightest romantic flavor to the story, which could stand on its own without these hackneyed stories.

The name of Tim Hunter might remind some viewers of his 'River's Edge,' but his direction here is that of forgettable straight-to-video films, which 'Contol' is actually is.  Not an awful film, but this misfired effort could be much better.",1114646400,2,2460,4.64203233256351
1215811,4,B00000FZL2,"The Pygmalion myth of radical transformation takes on a whole new meaning in Director Tim Hunter's film ""Control."" Modern pharmacology is the catalyst which turns violent career criminal and sociopath Lee Ray Olivier, (Ray Liotta), into a relatively normal human being, who understands the difference between right and wrong, and is capable of feeling remorse. Consider the implications if this kind of medication, proven effective, could be made available in some distant future. How would this effect violent crime?

Mr. Oliver believes he is being executed by lethal injection for his crimes. He shouts four-letter epithets at the witnesses as the fluid enters his bloodstream. When he awakens, however, he is not in Hell - he is alive, lying on a slab at the city morgue. Short and sweet - he is told that, if he is willing to be a test subject for a new medication, he could have a second chance at life. Otherwise, the execution will continue right there, in the morgue, immediately. The little yellow pills alter the brains chemistry, suppress violent tendencies and reduce aggression. What's he got to lose?

Dr. Miles Copeland, (William DeFoe), is a neuropharmacologist and the designer of the miracle drug he believes, if taken regularly, with appropriate supervision, can turn a brutal sociopath into an average citizen. There's lots of explosive violence, (Liotta is a master at portraying rage), until his brain chemistry is finally altered. Then the noticeable difference in the man is mind-boggling.

Phase two of the experiment has Oliver out on the street, with an apartment and job of his own, a monitoring device locked on his ankle, camera's in every room, and a surveillance van outside the front door. Through a series of ""unforeseeable events,"" he is forced to run, although his heart and soul are with the program. I don't want to give anything away...so I will stop here. But there are some twists and turns that even I did not see coming.

There are a lot of problems with this movie, but all-in-all, I liked it. I was certainly riveted to the screen. One is asked to suspend belief, and accept the premise that the state and federal government would turn loose a maniac criminal after only 12 weeks of treatment - just meds, no psychotherapy even. Then we wonder how ""the unforeseeable"" was not foreseen. These guys, a combo of FBI and police, along with the drug company goons, are supposed to be professionals! On the other hand, Liotta does a fabulous job of making his character a sympathetic figure, especially after the super violent beginning. I always like Willem DeFoe, and he is excellent as the idealistic doctor who wants to make a positive contribution to human life. There are some excellent action scenes and the suspense is chilling. The love interest works and Teresa, (played by Michelle Rodriguez), is adorable but just savvy enough to be credible in the role of former sociopath's girlfriend.

""Control"" was released late in 2004, but it garnered almost no coverage. I first saw the title while looking for a good rental. This will never be a classic, but it does provide interesting entertainment. I am not sorry at my choice, especially given the dearth of good films around.

7908951,5,B00000FZL2,"This is a very good suspenseful film with good acting and a twist at the end. It should have gotten more press. Surprisingly only about two dozen people reviewed the film but over 80 percent of them gave it either 4 or 5 stars.
It is about a ruthless highly enraged killer who had no conscience over the many brutalities and murders he committed. He was sentenced to death but was saved at the very last minute to be part of an experiment. Those who participated were given pills that were supposed to calm the criminals and turn them into good law-abiding people.
The criminal in this film Ray Liotta ingested the pills and seemed to become what the doctors wanted him to be. He even cried over what he did. He begged the pardon of a man he shot. His doctor William Dafoe was convinced that the pills were a success and Liotta was a changed man.

7908956,2,B00000FZL2,"Control begins with the apparent death of murderer Lee Ray Oliver (Ray Liotta) by lethal injection. We quickly learn, however, that the execution was staged so Lee Ray can be used as a test subject for Anagress, an experimental drug used to suppress people's violent behaviors. The caveat? Anagress's side effects are unknown and could prove deadly.

So Control goes. The story is an interesting one, and we witness Lee Ray's progression on-screen under the supervision of Dr. Copeland (Willem Dafoe) with intrigue. The problem with Control is that the script is weak, and not just in an it-could-have-been-better sort of way. It is painfully bad at times, especially in the latter half of the movie. For one, the security guards at the testing facility are so lackadaisical and inept in every single way that the viewer begins to question why they're even around; literally every time something goes wrong in Control it is due to their idiocy. Even worse, Lee Ray becomes incredibly boring once Anagress takes effect. Ray Liotta has never been an outstanding actor, but he did all he could with what he was given. Even Willem Dafoe, someone I would consider to be an exceptional actor, comes across as forced in some scenes, which to me is clear evidence the script is to blame for Control's shortcomings.

As another reviewer has said, Control is a tale of two Lee Rays: bad Lee Ray, and good Lee Ray. The night-to-day shift is too sudden and never really strikes the viewer as believable. Moreover, ""good"" Lee Ray is so docile at times he almost seems childlike. Because of this, the revelation at the end of the film ends up being far too fantastical to be taken seriously. There are other problems with Control (the ultra-hokey hitman), but most of them can be traced back to the lousy writing. I'm ok with movies that stretch believability, but I have no tolerance for movies that ask me to be stupid. Control is one of those movies.
