4594310,5,B00576U9EO,"Previously, One Piece was released in 13 episode sets for around $35. NOW, Funimation is unleashing these larger, 24 episode sets! Having seen Funimations One Piece dubs previously, these are greatly acted and the quality was great on their last One Piece sets. For the lower price AND a full 24 episodes, THIS is the time to buy One Piece in America!!! I preordered and will update my review upon arrival and completion.
This Collection 2 Set contains episodes 27-53.  Awesome deal!

UPDATE:
Watched the whole set and it was great.  Definitely the best deal around for OP DVDs.  Looking forward to the next sets INCLUDING the recently announced Season 4!",1310860800,28,655,4.873873873873874

4594393,5,B00576U9EO,"Even though the special features on Amazon just says trailers, the collection does come with episode commentaries, in which I just enjoy. Collection two wraps up Sanji's arc and changes directly into the Louge Town arc, in which introduces new characters like Tashigi, Captain Smoker, the newly improved Alvida, and finally, we get to see Dragon, Luffy's dad ( for only a short time but he is introduced here). The dub is fantastic and you can't go wrong with the price so I recommend getting this right away if you already haven't.",1403913600,,532,4.793478260869565
4594394,5,B00576U9EO,"Containing episodes 27 to 53, this collection wraps up Sanji's arc and contains the entirety of the arc that made me a fan of One Piece. The Arlong arc takes up about the entirety of this set, and shows you a side of One Piece that no one was ever expecting. A few tears were almost shed on my behalf, and rightfully so. 27 episodes for about 20 bucks is a steal, and I highly recommended this to anyone interested in the series. Just be patient, since the pacing of collection 1 is a bit slow. But its worth every cent.",1403568000,,520,4.158415841584159

4594401,4,B00576U9EO,"It's collection 2, so if reading this you probably already have a stance on the show, this is reviewing the DVDs themselves.

Case is normal DVD case with lots of discs almost crammed inside. Case successfully protects DVDs. Font on exterior of dvd can make reading disk numbers difficult.

Within DVD menu, you have normal play episode options without a lot of extra junk cluttering the DVD menu. One really cool feature is the marathon mode, which attempts to play the episodes in a continuous play with only a single theme and credits for the entire disc worth of episodes. I say attempts because they do fail at times to remove the ""what happened last time"" portion of each episode.

4/5. Would be 5/5 with the font and editing of the marathon feature completely realized.

Show is awesome and 5/5.",1397520000,,802,4.707142857142857

I THINK THE REASON I LKE IT SO MUCH IS BECAUSE THE MAIN CHARACTER IS JUST LIKE ME. AND I MEAN EXACTLY LIKE ME! IT'S COOL CAUSE I NEVER REALLY LIKED MYSELF BEFORE I WATCH THIS SHOW!! ESPECIALLY THIS DVD!! THIS ONE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD! AND TO ALL YOU OUT THERE, THIS SHOW IS SO GOOD, EVEN IF YOU CAN'T RELATE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER THE WAY I CAN, I GARAUNTEE THAT THERE IS A CHARACTER SOMEWHERE IN THIS SHOW THAT YOU CAN RELATE TOO!

4594407,5,B00576U9EO,"A little bit from my review of season 1:
  ""Don't let quirky animation style fool you...  This is truly a treasure in entertainment.  Great humor, amazing stories, spectacular character development... You will laugh, you will definitely cry, but above all, you will enjoy the journey and will find yourself caring for these characters and their aspirations.""

  A lot happens in this season... And again I am not going to talk about it.  Needless to say, the fights get more serious, the stakes are higher, the drama... well, let's just say that Nami is carrying a very, very heavy burden that leads to one of the most emotional stories I have ever read or seen, ever.

  Anyway, season 2 improves over the first season by making the strawhats test their resolve, making us cheer for them a lot more...  Some episodes are slower paced but never dull or unimportant, all around great second season.",1388793600,2,897,4.790849673202614

This collection  pack is my favorite because the Along Park arc is probably my favorite arc in the series (my other favorites are Water 7, Sabaody Archipelago,  Marine Ford,  and Fishman Island).

4594420,5,B00576U9EO,This is my second review from a One Piece collection being the 2nd one ive bought. One Piece is a steal with 26 episodes for $20 dollars. Thats less than a $1 per episode. Plus they come with a good looking Slipcover its  not much but its the small details and things that show just how much effort they put on these. I already ordered the 3rd collection. One Piece is Awesome.,1367884800,,377,4.236111111111111

4594423,5,B00576U9EO,"One Piece is something of an acquired taste as its animation style is heavily stylized and not the more realistic style of some newer titles.  However, it is chock full of a huge number of complicated characters and has a wide ranging plot line that extends well past 500 episodes.",1363305600,,281,4.62
4594424,5,B00576U9EO,"The second set of Funimation's One Piece DVDs I bought, this one proved just as good as the first. It contains the remainder of the Baratie arc from the first set, and all of the Arlong arc (which is when the show truly found its footing). The sound and picture quality is impeccable; and the dub is much closer to Eichiro Oda's vision than the odious 4Kids dub (which has now been mostly forgotten, save for an example of how NOT to dub a series). This DVD will make a great addition to your anime collection. Check it out, and set sail for adventure!",1362528000,,552,4.3173076923076925

4594427,5,B00576U9EO,Enjoyed reading it and I like the fact that they don't put fillers in the middle of main story. It's got a pretty funny story and they put a bit of thought in the lessons they teach my nephews enjoy some of it the ones that are old enough to understand.,1360108800,,253,3.980392156862745

4594431,4,B00576U9EO,"This collection was great! The only problem was that one of the CD holders was broken, but other than that this was a good product. I love One Piece!",1357344000,,149,4.172413793103448
4594432,5,B00576U9EO,"i rated it 5 stars because it is my favorite anime and the quality is great

i would recommend it to a friend",1357084800,,109,3.739130434782609
4594433,5,B00576U9EO,"One piece is the best anime!!!!! Recommend to everyone. It has a good story, comedy, drama, and everything you could ask for in an anime.",1356825600,,137,4.52
4594434,5,B00576U9EO,The DVD came as described in a timely fashion and this series is a great series to own. I am so happy with this product.,1354752000,,120,3.84
4594435,5,B00576U9EO,"After battling the black cat pirates, the Straw Hat Pirates have gained Usopp as a member and the ship The Going Merry. They later arrive at a ship/restaurant, where they enlist the master chef, Sanji. Not only is Sanji a master chef, he is also a master of fighting using his feet. He's a great character and a nice addition to the crew.

This anime is incredible. It's got action, comedy, adventure, and suspense. The voice actors are all familiar to just about any casual or serious anime fan. This anime also has a lot of Dragonball-like fun in it. It's tons of fun to watch and keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Now that Funimation has started releasing One Piece in these box sets, it's more affordable than ever. Any fan of anime, or any fan of fun in general will find this series a breath of fresh air. It's a must see.",1353456000,,839,4.378205128205129
4594436,4,B00576U9EO,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view.,1351987200,,121,5.1
4594437,5,B00576U9EO,"The show is awesome If you haven't tried it you should , luffy is hilarious, a gloriously hilarious idiot you can't help but love. The story is great.. despite the fact that luffy can be and is an idiot 95% of the time ,he has the respect.... for the most part,of his crew. He will help out in the most dangerous of situations even if your a complete stranger. He is quick in fist and slow in thought but he is capable of thinking things through....on ocassion. Zoro the swordsman.. Usopp the sharp shooter, Nami the navigator, Sanji the cook , Chopper the doctor plus three more that will introduce themselves later in the series(if your smart enough to drink the delicious kool aide that is onepiece),round out his pirate crew ----dubbed or subbed ,I can and have watched this so over and over again my sister is into it now and I'm watching it again with her",1349568000,,861,4.455696202531645
4594438,5,B00576U9EO,"It's a reaally good show,but I thought the 4kids actors,and actress where better than funimation. But they sound pretty fair,you should buy it if you into pirate shows!",1348531200,,168,5.035714285714286
4594439,5,B00576U9EO,"In this point of the show I had decided that I will definitely keep watching One Piece. After I seen the Zoro vs Hawk Eye And Luffy vs Kreig I saw what a powerful story this show was turning into. its hard to say if this show is the best because Naruto and Dragon Ball Z are great and their action is unrivaled. But this shows action can get very bad ass especially in the very later episodes they action in this show gets epic. But the fact that this anime is most likely to have up to 700 or 800 episodes along with the powerful story makes you have to consider this show being as great as DBZ and Naruto, Bleach, Fullmetal, Etc (Anime Listed from top greatest)",1347408000,,663,4.147286821705427
4594440,4,B00576U9EO,in this review unlike the last i will talk about the dub. I can only talk about the translated music and dubbing. The translated music is great but seeing we are atleast 20 more times is hard to do so i recommend you use marathon mode. I have to remove a star for the dubbing. collen clinckenbeard (excuse my spelling) does luffy. she does a perfect job. christopher sabat does zoro and its basically piccolo but calm. luci christan does a very good nami. sonny strait basically did usopp as krillin. eric vale does sanji and it has to be the second best main character voice. I think villains are lacking because seems to voice a new villain they just talk deeper every time. the extras SUCK for the most part. they are to bland and similar. if you think hearing piccolo and krillin wasn't enough Dbz dub for you than im glad to tell you that I swear one of the extras in the first two collections is master roshi. Its not a cameo its laziness on the actors part. Unacceptable!,1343865600,,978,4.3791208791208796
4594441,5,B00576U9EO,"The straw hat crew is back. Now luffy is looking for a chef for his crew. He comes across a master chef named Sanji.

4594442,5,B00576U9EO,"I simply can't explain how exciting it is to finally be able to own a legal copy of One Piece in America!
Thank you Funimation for providing an excellent product:
* uncut & unedited
* Japanese audio and English subtitles available
* quality English dub as well
* and all for a great low price

I only wish they were coming out faster so I could own them all right now!",1328832000,6,368,4.183098591549296
4594443,5,B00576U9EO,"Monkey D. Luffy, the rediculous rubberman, continues of his quest to become king of the pirates. And continues his rampage of good deeds. He (and now his crew) manage to still cause massive mayhem and destruction while never quite doing evil things. I.e., beating the daylights out of other pirates who are doing the expected pirate robbing, killing and enslaving, freeing the victims. Unfortunately, This usually includes whaling the tar out of crooked government officials, resulting in his getting a huge bounty on his head.",1327190400,,527,5.211764705882353
4594444,5,B00576U9EO,"This is most definitely a great investment for any One Piece fan that wants to start a collection of the series! It includes both the original Japanese audio with subtitles by Funimation, as well as the English Funimation job (on which, as a fan of the original Japanese version and manga, Funimation did an absolutely amazing job on compared to most dubbing jobs.) If you're a One Piece fan and appreciate the Funimation dubbing job, this is your buy! It includes a commentary by the staff, voice actors, writers, directors etc. on two of the episodes, which are not only amusing but give you a good idea of what goes into dubbing One Piece as well as they do. The quality is fantastic. After watching the whole of the One Piece series online I can only say that the beautiful quality of this DVD blew me away the moment I set it up. The casing is compact, glossy, and definitely ideal for a complete collection.

I can honestly say that I'd pay three times as much as I paid for this knowing it's as great as it is.

The only down side is the subtitles. They don't match the English voices, rather just use the Japanese translation and often times the words at the bottom of the screen are horribly different from what they're actually hearing. Quite annoying if you're hard of hearing or watching with someone who is (which I will be) but only a minor set back. Otherwise this product is amazing... its arrival in my mailbox made my night!",1325721600,2,1442,4.5
4594445,5,B00576U9EO,this is an awesome product for One Piece fans! this collection contains the uncut English episodes; episode 27 through 53. the strawhat crew leave logetown and head for the grandline. with 4 dics this collection contains a lot more action then buying each voyage individually,1325376000,,275,5.133333333333334
4594446,5,B00576U9EO,"I've been a fan of One Piece for a few years now and had looked into supporting the series by buying DVD's before. They were very expensive and with so many episodes in this series you would have had to buy many sets. The collections are really the best deal available for getting this series. Not only is it a good deal but this set contains the Arlong arc, one of the best fights early on, IMO. The DVD's are fairly bare bones containing two episodes with commentary and a few trailers, hardly ""extras"". That being said the episodes are fairly high quality for being 10 years old. The marathon feature is great but can trick you into watching more episodes than you may want to or even think you have watched, not necessarily a bad thing. The only negative about the marathon feature is that while they remove the opening and ending songs they do not remove the recaps at the beginning of the episodes, slightly disappointing. Overall a great set at a great price, if you have been a fan of this series or just interested in it pick this set up, you will not be disappointed.",1323043200,,1077,4.417085427135678

But, if you are a lover of anime & especially ONE PIECE like i am, this is the best way to enjoy it @ $20.00 a season....you cant beat it. Im sure we were all tired of investing into separate DVDs we now have the opportunity to purchase each complete season. you will pat yourself on the back for this ;) [...]",1322438400,,486,4.293478260869565

So now that these new collections are comeing out cheaper then ever I decided to take up watching them. The episodes are great and I have no complaints with any of the DVDs.

I just want to know if they can come out with these box sets at a faster pace?!? I have the third collection pre-ordered but I've already gone through the first and second box sets and awaiting to buy the fourth if there is one.",1318982400,,518,4.232323232323233
4594450,5,B00576U9EO,"Funimation does a great job of dubbing one of the most popular animated series in Japan. This uncut DVD features 26 episodes for a lower price than previous releases. The menu setup and music is great, with an option to do ""Marathon Viewing"" which eliminates continuous theme songs and credits. The box art, as well, is very appealing to the eye. It may feel like it'll take decades until they catch up with the current episode count running in Japan, but for fans of the series who enjoy it, this DVD set will satisfy your urge to watch this amazing series from its earlier days.",1318896000,7,580,4.533333333333333
