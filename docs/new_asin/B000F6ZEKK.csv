2553491,5,B000F6ZEKK,"This was excellent!  It is really wrongly described as a ""documentary""--it is really a one-man play.  At first, I thought it was going to be kind of hokey, but as it progressed, I was enthralled.  Brilliant summary and exposition of methodism, to be sure, but also a tale of simple faith held with passion by those who were willing to suffer ridicule and physical attack to help people know God.  I also enjoyed the stories behind Charles Wesley's hymns, especially ""O For a Thousand Tongues"".  Highly recommended.",1440374400,,514,4.862068965517241
2553492,4,B000F6ZEKK,"Great performance with excellent overview of both Wesleys and the early Methodist movement.  I had one or two minor quibbles on wording of a couple of historical references, but the presentation is amazingly complete and captivating.  The videography and overall ""punch""  of production may not be up to current standards, but it is very much worth watching and sharing.  With a song-sheet available for live participation, it would make a good segment for a class or retreat.",1428019200,,475,5.12987012987013
2553493,5,B000F6ZEKK,"Excellent recitation of Charles Wesley's life as he would have told it. Charlie, he calls himself. Don't look for a movie; this is a recitation of a life and a life's work. Whether you are Christian or not, Methodist or not, this is a must-watch. It is not only about the founding and growth of a major Christian faith, it is about an era in British history and early American history. It should not be overlooked, as the cultural influence of this man and his brother John was - and still is - immense. Students of hymnology will also want to include this video in their experience.
The construction of the video itself should be 4 stars probably, as they panned the modern-day audience way to many times. The video-sound coordination at times, especially at the ending climax, was sadly lacking. But given the script and performance itself, I'm going with five stars.",1420243200,2,869,4.686274509803922
2553494,5,B000F6ZEKK,"Excellent!  I am actually pleasantly surprised.  This actor was great and the information is accurate.

I honestly disagree with the complaints in the other comments, especially the individual who said this DVD was boring.  It is only boring if you are not interested in the Wesleys and Methodism.

I often have complaints about the quality of Christian movies.  I find them quite ""corny"".  I expected this to be no exception.  However, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  I can tell that everyone involved in putting this together did their very best.  They should all be proud of themselves.

Great job!",1414022400,4,614,4.864077669902913
2553495,5,B000F6ZEKK,"This performance is very well done and very informative for the foundations of Methodism and Christianity in America.  Not everyone is interested in these things, but those who are will be drawn into the performance to the point where one feels like they are truly listening to Charlie.",1390176000,3,286,4.958333333333333
2553496,2,B000F6ZEKK,I ordered this for my husband who loves this hymn writer.  I was expecting more along the line of the fanny crosby story.  This dvd was pretty boring and didn't have much about the history of the actual hymns (this is what I wanted).  The dvd was in the condition it was said to be in and did arrive promptly but I wouldn't really recommend it for the money.,1359072000,,358,4.159420289855072
2553497,1,B000F6ZEKK,"I had planned on showing this to my elementary music students, but in the first five minutes ""Mr. Wesley"" is talking about his affair in college. This should be stated that it's not for children.",1205625600,,195,4.6
2553498,4,B000F6ZEKK,"Charles Wesley was a prolific hymn writer who penned a mind-blogging 6,500 hymns over the course of his life, often writing one hymn per day for extended periods of time. Of course only a tiny percentage of these continue to be sung with regularity in today's churches. Among the enduring favorites are the holiday mainstays ""Christ The Lord is Risen Today"" and ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."" We also continue to sing, among others, ""And Can It Be That I Should Gain,"" ""Oh For A Thousand Tongues To Sing,"" ""Come Thou Long Expected Jesus,"" and ""Rejoice! the Lord is King."" Wesley left an enduring legacy to the church and one that is loved and respected within a wide variety of Christian traditions.

When Wesley began writing hymns, congregational singing was largely unknown, something that might come as a shock to many contemporary Christians. Anglican churches, which represented a majority of British and North American believers, sponsored magnificent choirs, but rarely encouraged the congregation to sing along. Having been inspired by a group of Moravians with whom they shared a journey from England to the United States, Charles and his brother John began to write hymns, and in doing so, changed the church forever.

Hymns of Praise: Charles Wesley, is one man's attempt at allowing today's Christians meet this prolific hymn writer and inspired man of God. John Jackman portrays Wesley in a one-man play. He mixes narrative with song, often leading the audience and his small foundry choir in renditions of his hymns, even occasionally playing the hymns with their original, long-forgotten tunes. Jackman, as Wesley, recounts the history of his life: from the early days of Methodism to his conversion and to his ministry with his brother John. He discusses his growth in understanding biblical theology and even discusses the wedge that existed between himself, an Arminian, and the great George Whitefield, a Calvinist. In short, he provides an interactive, amusing, 90-minute biography of this man of God.

On the whole the results are very good. I enjoyed this film and, to be honest, struggled only with the actor's attempt at singing with a period British accent. Beyond that small complaint, I found the play and production sound and can honestly say that I benefited from watching it. Hymns of Praise: Charles Wesley is quite a unique idea, and one that Jackman delivers successfully. It would be a valuable addition to a church or public library.",1200960000,2,2470,5.063882063882064
8118307,2,B000F6ZEKK,Couldn't finish watching this. Wasn't really a movie but more of a taped stage show of one person talking the whole time. I didn't care for it.,1485129600,,143,4.333333333333333
8118308,2,B000F6ZEKK,"In this one person dramatic presentation, the actor presents an autobiographical picture of Charles Wesley including his life growing up, his failed attempts as a preacher and his success as a lyricist of some of Christianity's favorite hymns.",1485129600,,243,5.421052631578948

8118313,2,B000F6ZEKK,"A one-man show taped in some church's fellowship hall. The actor is mildly ingratiating and the script is slightly engaging, a series of stories for a general audience, but the staging is pedestrian and the editing is atrocious. There is no reason whatsoever to pan 150 times to the audience, who are (no fault of their own) as dull as a group of Methodists sitting in a fellowship hall. You'll save time and learn more simply reading about the Wesley Brothers on Wikipedia.",1466035200,,474,4.72289156626506
