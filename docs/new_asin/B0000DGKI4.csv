8000958,5,B0000DGKI4,"My two year old loves dragon tales. We picked up a VHS player at a thrift store for her room, which is a good suggestion for any parent with small kids, since you can get the tapes for next to nothing, especially compared to DVDs. That's how we discovered dragon tales and with the show ending in 2005, it has me searching the internet for more movies and toys.  Like i said she loves the shows and as a parent i am happy with the messages and morals it projects. It's not the best illustrated cartoon I've ever seen, but it makes her happy and that's all that counts. Well be ordering many more tapes very soon.",1362528000,,612,4.230769230769231
8000959,3,B0000DGKI4,"These Dragon Tales are not nearly as good as the newer kids' videos like Dora, Diego and The Backyardigans.  They have good messages but I found the voices a bit irritating.  The Spanish soundtrack has some translation errors--not that it isn't correct Spanish but that I think the original meaning of some phrases was misunderstood.  This series isn't as good as I had hoped it would be.",1319673600,,388,4.7611940298507465
