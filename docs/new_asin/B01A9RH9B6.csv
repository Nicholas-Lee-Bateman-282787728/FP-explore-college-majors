7596777,4,B01A9RH9B6,"Cancelled before it had the chance to find an audience (as SyFy typically did at the time in favor of crappy TV movies), ""Caprica"" was originally envisioned to last four seasons setting up the world 58 years prior to the Cylons attack on humanity in ""Battlestar:Galactica"". A well written series that had just taken flight when it was cancelled, ""Caprica"" features terrific performances unfortunately the series never did receive a Blu-ray release in the United States because, Universal in their infinite wisdom, diced there wasn't a demand. Thank God for Europe and region free Blu-ray Discs. This Swedish release features a region 0 of the series. Be aware, however, that some Sony players won't be able to play the discs past the start up menu even if the player has the latest firmware update. I'm not sure if all BD Ultra players can play this but, since the discs are not region encoded as I understand it, this should be playable.

For the record, the menu looks stylish but I hate it. Why? A more straight forward one would have been easier to use and I'm all about ease of use but that's me.

The depth, detail and transfer truly pops in 1080p. It's a pity that Universal has been so short sighted about this--perhaps Mill Creek or Shout can license the series (and include the special features included on the DVD and here) but at least this is available.

It isn't flawless however. There are a couple of dialog drop outs in the first disc. I don't know if it was ever corrected (I purchased this recently) but it is a minor distracting flaw. Some of the special features may not play because they were put together in the PAL format for,the original release here. I can't say how this was encoded here so those features may or may not play on your BD or Ultra BD player.

As with the DVDs, this has the commentary tracks that were on the DVDs (although they aren't mentioned on the back of the box) as well accessible via the language menu. Subtitles are available in multiple languages including English.

Synopsis: After a family tragedy,  Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) alters the development of his robotics program taking it in an unexpected direction when he discovers a program developed by his daughter that demonstrates consciousness? Linked by this tragedy, lawyer Joseph Adama (Esai Morales) develops a bond with Daniel and both decide to use the AI to bring back deceased family members with unforeseen consequences.

All 18 episodes of the series are presented on five discs. The image and sound quality (with the curious exceptions of the two drop outs) are exceptional. I do wish that Universal would get their stuff together and release this domestically as it would be less expensive and fans wouldn't have to take the risk that their players might not be compatible (Sony seems to have issues with this with more than this set).",1487116800,17,2859,4.752016129032258

I'm indeed pleased. I do hope there is a season 2 someday that ties in with the development of the Cylons and the Graystones before the actors fade away knowing there still out there.",1461801600,9,395,4.6571428571428575

8746831,4,B01A9RH9B6,"This is not so much a review of the show itself as it is of the Swedish Blu-Ray as it pertains to American audiences.  I enjoyed the show quite a bit, and while it didn't captivate me the way the BSG remake did, there's a lot to love for fans of that show, or anyone who likes their sci-fi mixed with questions of philosophy and identity.

I saw some reviews saying these discs might not work on U.S. players, but I decided to take the plunge.  My only Blu-Ray players are also Sony gaming consoles, and I found that while I have no problems with playback on my PS4, the PS3 can't get past the initial warning cards to the actual main menu (these are the ones that say ""The commentary tracks are the opinions of the actors..."", ""This work is under copyright..."" etc.).  It plays the Universal logo and cycles through those cards, but it seems like there is a hitch getting from there to the main episode selection / setup menu.  There may be a way to jump there with a little remote control trickery, but I haven't played with it enough to say for sure.

So that's that - from the 30 seconds or so I've seen of the actual transfer, it looks quite nice, and a marked step up from DVD.  Just be forewarned that if you're using a PS3 or an older Blu-Ray player, you may have some playback issues.",1517875200,,1293,4.253061224489796
