5621214,3,B00BH4196M,"""The Tarzan Collection"" is a five-disc DVD release containing five Tarzan features released between 1962 and 1968.  The first two -- ""Tarzan Goes to India"" and ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"" -- star Jock Mahoney, the skinniest movie Tarzan of them all, perhaps because during filming he contracted dysentery, dengue fever, and pneumonia.  Best known as the title character of the late 50's TV Western ""Yancy Derringer,"" Mahoney began his Hollywood career as a stunt man, doubling for Errol Flynn, John Wayne, and Gregory Peck.

Mike Henry plays the title role in ""Tarzan and the Valley of Gold,"" ""Tarzan and the Great River,"" and ""Tarzan and the Jungle Boy.""  Originally a professional football player, Henry was under contract to Warner Brothers and played several bit parts on TV. He was cast by producer Sy Weintraub, who was looking for a young Burt Lancaster.  Like Mahoney, Henry underwent a number of mishaps during filming, including animal bites, food poisoning, infections, and overly demanding work schedules in Mexico and Brazil.

The films themselves are merely OK and rehash territory covered in previous Tarzan and/or jungle pictures.  For the ultimate screen Tarzan, check out the early MGM Tarzan movies featuring Johnny Weissmuller.",1364428800,5,1247,5.299492385786802

5621218,3,B00BH4196M,"Jock Mahoney is the worst Tarzan in the characters history. The stories of his two films are solid adventure movies, but Tarzan feels bolted on. The same goes for the Mike Henry movies,  the second worst actor in the characters history.",1416700800,,236,4.7560975609756095
