8264597,5,B000EQ46UA,"I was skeptical when I saw this series and wondered just how this broad topic would be handled.  To my delight I found it succinct, accurate, without bias and each historical subject just covered with enough detail to create interest without being overwhelming.  This series attempts to present significant accomplishments of women throughout history without a ""hidden agenda.""  It shows women as co-creators and co-developers of our American heritage without any implication that they did it alone or that they were finally ""free"" of the opression of men.  It is a sound educational piece.",1205020800,11,590,5.24468085106383
