330534,4,6301454901,What a fabulous movie....I saw it as a child and it has burnt a fond memory within my memory. The story of a rich Father trying to make a mends with his estranged son and whilst doing so finds out that his son has less then a year to live. Fearing that he has missed out on the boys life he starts to spoil the boy with outlandish gifts. One of the gifts was a pair of wollves stolen from a zoo in france. The wolves adopt the boy as one of the pack and the story develops.....be warned....its a tear jerker. The only complaint is that the movie being old has a few cracks in the sound and picture quality. Certainly worth buying though.,1233273600,3,637,4.104
330535,4,6301454901,"..filmed in parts of just Europe: a son, his dad, a mom to be, a friend & 2 wolves ending up to xmas eve in france. good original movie w/ good acting; very sad when i saw it 1st time when i was lil'. the kid passed too quik @ the end; strange how he got leukemia from the get go and not his dad, even though his dad was under water @ the time of the weapon plane crash, as they were near the greek isles-corsica. the dad-(w. holden) was very giving w/ cool but wild discretion; the kid-brook fuller hasn't been seen in a movie anymore as far as i know since the leopard'. wonder if this is based on a true story;liked the wolves-of the kid's best friends.

somewhat, i agree on what a reviewer somewhere in this review list said of the kids personality.

saw the end of this once unexpectedly; knew it was a special movie as it'll always be, making tears @ the end. a wonderful, sad, kind of strange but very good, rare film, which is 1 of my fav. wm. holden films, up there w/ omen2.  Cool to see virna lisi actress here.",1184284800,4,1023,4.079601990049751
330536,5,6301454901,"I first saw this movie as a young boy in 1978 and was particularly moved by the story.  The movie portrays a wealthy father, successful in business, whose son is tragically taken ill after a military plane explodes overhead whilst they are on holiday. The father is underwater at the time and is not affected.  However, the plane appears to have been carrying some nuclear device whose fallout affects the boy.
The story then shows a major re-alignment of the father's priorities as he discovers that all of his contacts and money actually mean much less to him than his son's well being.
Set primarily in France and with the aid of some strong supporting roles, the film cannot fail to touch the heart.",1008288000,18,703,4.661290322580645
330557,5,6301454901,This is a beautiful movie. Many people world wide would like to see it. Why in this day and age can no one get a good clean dvd of this movie.  We can watch video's of Paris Hilton sex tape or Lindsey Lohamm arrested again but not a heartfelt movie like this !!!,1412035200,5,262,3.943396226415094

330559,5,6301454901,I saw this movie when I was 8 years old and I always remembered it.  I was living in Germany at the time and the European setting really made me interested in the movie.  It was a very nice yet poignant story.  I am really happy to have found it and to have watched it again after so many years.,1389916800,3,295,3.8833333333333333
330560,5,6301454901,"I saw this when it played at Radio City Music Hall--my roommate and I went for the Christmas show and got to see this movie and I've been trying to find it since then.  I don't generally go to movies that make me cry.  Not sure why this wasn't more popular, why you never see it on tv considering it's got that whole anti-nuke theme, wolves, how money can buy you a lot but not everything theme.",1388966400,,395,4.116883116883117
330561,5,6301454901,"This is a heart-wrenching story and a much underrated movie of Bill Holden's.  He liked to go against type and the grain from time to time and here is one of his best efforts.  I don't think it was a box office success.  It's a very dignified movie about losing a child.  The acting might seem a bit stiff by today's standards but the story is quite compelling.  It will be enjoyed and appreciated by anyone who has love in their heart.

This hard to find movie is a classic.",1385424000,2,475,4.222222222222222
330562,5,6301454901,"A very touching movie about the close relationship between a dying boy and his devoted father, a father who was willing to do anything to make his son happy before he passed away. William Holden was brilliant in this movie. A true classic movie that would be a worhwhile addition to anyone's dvd collection.",1385164800,4,307,4.703703703703703
330563,5,6301454901,"I am so happy to have finally found this movie on DVD.  Yes, it is grainy, but so was my VHS tape.  I received the day after ordering, with a very kind note attached.  I'm a happy camper!",1381449600,,187,3.8684210526315788
330564,5,6301454901,"Price was high, but well worth it to find this movie classic treasure.  Arrived in good time and shipping/handling was reasonable.  Arrived with long list of long lost movie titles.  So, if you're searching...",1379289600,2,209,5.088235294117647
330565,2,6301454901,Dumb movie!  Who lets a child live with wolves or ride a snowplow/ tractor.  Poorly made!  William holden was such a class act!  Why did he do something like this!  Just poorly made and follow thru!,1377216000,,198,4.388888888888889
330566,2,6301454901,So hard to believe!  Love william holden so bought it.  Not one of his best works!  Just one of his so-so movies!,1376611200,,113,4.045454545454546
330578,5,6301454901,The movie was just as I remembered it when I was younger. Nice film about a Fathers love for his son. I recommend this movie to anyone.,1373932800,,135,4.037037037037037
330579,4,6301454901,"I have been looking for years for this old movie on CD and was always suspect when I would locate it because it was always outside the U.S. so needless to say I was thrilled when I finally found it! on Amazon. The movie has always been a favourite of mine and the old VHS copy was a relic since we got rid of all our old players. The movie quality itself is poor but I am okay with that knowing my original VHS was the same, I am just glad I can watch it again during the holidays and ball my eyes out, and oh yes, the piano music is lovely!",1365811200,10,541,3.8392857142857144
330580,5,6301454901,This is a really heart-warming movie set in the '60's when the cold war was in full bloom.  A powerful statement about the damage hate can cause.,1361750400,,145,4.37037037037037
330581,2,6301454901,"I had seen this film several years ago at the theater, thus my desire to obtain it.  I should have known with an older DVD there would be problems.  While attempting to watch the movie with two friends whom had never seen it. The picture often jumped and blurred in spots, etc.  It was a very disappointing viewing  :(",1360195200,,318,4.338983050847458
330582,4,6301454901,I hazily remembered watching this movie on TV around Christmas time when I was in Jr. High or High School. No one I ever talked to about it ever seemed to remember it so I thought maybe I disremembered it. But here it is just as I recalled. I wish like heck that some network would broadcast it again.,1324684800,,301,4.11864406779661
330583,4,6301454901,"I saw this movie on TV in the mid-seventies.  It was dubbed in English from the original French.  I must have been about ten or eleven at the time.  It moved me a lot and made a big impact on me.  Now, many years later, I remembered it and Googled cancer, radiation, christmas and wolves and good old Google found it for me in about two seconds.  So now I'm here on Amazon trying to buy it.  Problem is, there's some animated kids movie called ""The Christmas Tree"" as well, and it's getting totally mixed up in the sales and availability with the William Holden movie that I want.  I'm afraid to buy it and have them send me the wrong thing.  Also, it appears the movie I want is only available on VHS.  I haven't dusted off the old VHS player for probably 8 or 9 years.  (It's on a shelf in the closet next to an 8-track tape player and a Colecovision. LOL)",1321056000,,858,4.1454545454545455

Unfortunately, I ordered this movie from my sister's home and did not save a copy or my order.  So I am unable to return this movie to the seller.  When I received the envelope, it had a P.O.B number and I was unable to return the wrong movie to a P.O.B..  So I am stuck with the wrong movie...any suggestions to return this movie?

330586,4,6301454901,"This was a film I remembered as a kid. It made an impact on me as a child so I was curious to see it again. I like the story but I thought the kid was a spoiled gay brat, not that there's anything wrong with that, but it would be a nice story to remake with some changes.",1261612800,,271,3.610169491525424
