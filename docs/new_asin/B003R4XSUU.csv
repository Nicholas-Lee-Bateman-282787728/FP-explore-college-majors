8403239,2,B003R4XSUU,"I thought this would be a naam yoga cd, but it's more of a lecture/instructional video you would just watch and not necessarily sit and practice along to. I bought it because I wanted to do a guided yoga for an hour or so, but the most that it offers is about 3 minutes of breathing, chanting, and mudras. The rest of the time, there's a guy's voice going on and on about the benefits of each and it's very distracting. I am kind of disappointed with this and hardly have any use for it.",1414022400,,487,4.136842105263158
