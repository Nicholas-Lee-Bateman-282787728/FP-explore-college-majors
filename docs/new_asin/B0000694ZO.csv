7965083,4,B0000694ZO,"""Stage To Mesa City"": in this picture U.S. Marshall Cheyenne Davis(Lash LaRue) and his deputy Fuzzy Jones(Fuzzy StJohn) are sent to solve a rash of stage holdups. Just as they arrive the owner of the stage line is killed, leaving his son and daughter,(played by the lovely Jennifer Holt),  to run the business and try to secure the mail contract for their company. But the bad guys are after the stage line and the mail contract too and it's up to Cheyenne and Fuzzy to stop them. there's plenty of action packed into this film.
 Lash LaRue is an interesting cowboy. He's different than Gene Autry or Roy Rogers. Lash is always dressed completely in black and wears a two gun rig. He also carries a whip,(which earned him the name Lash), that he uses with obvious skill.  Fuzzy StJohn was a veteran sidekick actor by the time he played opposite Lash,(you've seen him with Buster Crabbe, Jack Randall, George Houston). He ably handles whatever situation arises whether it be action or comedy.  Also in the cast are George Chesebro and Marshall Reed.
 I only purchased ""Stage To Mesa City"" and not the accompanying Eddie Dean film. After reading the film reviews I noted that most of the complaints people had were with murky picture quality. I found ""Stage To Mesa City"" to have fairly crisp and clear print quality.",1234915200,2,1315,4.7
7965084,3,B0000694ZO,"Specifically regarding the release by Video Kart. Stage to Mesa City is from a good print which does have some segments that are very dark and with little contrast. Overall, it is a good viewing experience.

Meanwhile, Hawk of Powder River ranges from fair to poor. Some segments are black without any image. Many segments are soft and fuzzy. A few segments are excellent. The audio is substandard. Overall, a bad viewing experience.

So, essentially you are buying one film. Don't expect more and you will not be disappointed. While some reviewers make excuses for the DVD releases, the bottom line is that good source prints produce good picture quality. I think this double feature was assembled just to release product.",1175472000,,723,4.966942148760331
7965085,4,B0000694ZO,"I saw both of these films on television a while back and enjoyed them. I agree with the other person who reviewed this DVD that the sound is flat and the contrast is off in a few areas. One thing Mr. something-ham doesn't realize or forgot to mention is that the film is of the B-western genre from the 1940's. These films were made that poorly from the day they were written. They were more like television episodes than movies. The entire genre was a very historical moment in motion picture history. I can't remember the last time I watched the Honeymooners and experienced a sense of ""depth"" in the acoustics. I am grateful that there is someone who cares enough to distribute this historical content on a new medium for people who understand and appreciate motion pictures. Thank you, I will be looking for more titles to be released from this studio.",1037836800,4,856,4.601307189542483
7965086,1,B0000694ZO,"I have this last day received a DVD copy of these two films and my message to anyone considering buying is, 'keep your money in your pocket'.  Not only are the films themselves poor entertainment value but the transfer onto DVD is dismal... BR>For one thing the contrast is poor especially in the darkened scenes and the sound tranfer although high enough in volume is badly badly dubbed in. This has slightly alterd the tone of the actors voices and also makes the sound seem totally flat, with no appearance of distance or the actors position on the screen.
I've certanly learned my lesson about buying cheap DVDs, if they are cheap in price they are cheap in quality and not worth buying.
Although I do have to admit that I do have some budget DVDs which are acceptable, I suppose it's all to do with which company produces the goods....  I have given this DVD one star, only because I have no choice if I want to air my views",1036713600,,929,4.426900584795321
