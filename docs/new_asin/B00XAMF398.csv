8715586,5,B00XAMF398,"Very European spy-type of thriller...with lots of conversations, plot-twists, and quickly moving turn of events. The film concentrates on the internal war within the British MI-5 (equivalent of the American CIA).  If it helps, the character of James Bond or agent 007 works for the same organization.  The story-line goes like this: a dangerous Muslim terrorist by the name of Quasim is rescued by his men from a convoy that is transporting him into the hands of CIA.  An MI-5 leader of the operation Harry Pearce makes the decision to let Quasim go free without jeopardizing the lives of his people and the surrounding pedestrians.  He than disappears without a word.  Pears believes that someone with in MI-5 helped Quasim and his men in the rescue operation.  He is trying to find who is the mole.  He does not trust anyone, so for help he asks a troublemaker and former young agent of MI-5 by the name of Will Holloway.  The two men will embark on a crazy mission that will take them from England to Germany and back to England and will test their loyalties...in the end their mission will shatter the inner-circle of MI-5 organization and rescue London from a major terrorist attack.",1450742400,3,1188,4.760975609756097
