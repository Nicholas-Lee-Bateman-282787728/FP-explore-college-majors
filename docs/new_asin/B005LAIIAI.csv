4766377,1,B005LAIIAI,"This film is one of the worst films i have seen in the past 3 years. This film is just, just a big waste bucket of a film. No wonder this is the first film to be released in 2013, its horrible. How can it even get a 19% on Rotten Tomatoes this film is just horrible. All it is , is a piece of gore, stitched together with a number of bodies, and horrible everything. God this film is just a waste. Yes, i know i am critical about most horror films , but you gotta believe me i try to see the best in them and i just can't see anything good in this film- nothing. There is nothing i liked about this film. It left me wanting my money and time back in the end. Ok now to talk about all the bad things this film has to offer the audience. Lets see.... Ok we have a weak story and script, plain and stupid characters, wooden acting, no scares, horrible ending, and horrible special effects . Ok now lets start with the weak story and script. The story here is basically this girl who brings some friends to this house and leatherface kills them all well at least thats the first 30 minutes then we have basically the surviving girl in the police station and getting kidnapped. Thats about it for the story. The script is bad it is, i mean every line each character delivers is just idiotic and cheesy. Its all like been there seen that. I mean i knew this film was going to be a B- Movie, but everyline? Give me a break. As you may know with a weak script and only a half an hour with the group of 20 year olds there would of course not be any character development. Its true the first character dies when he goes down to a basement then he dies , then another guy goes down there and he dies. That's basically the first 10 minutes of the film before we get 10 minutes break before we see the black guy crash the dang car and die. It's all very ""yawn , yawn"" boring. We don't learn anything about the characters before they are brutally cut in half. You don't really like the characters anyway they are mostly self centered. The acting in this film is just as bad its wooden, unbelievable. Yuck, the worst here is Shaun Sipos are, hitch hiker. His acting is just bla , bla , bla, you know what i mean? This film is surpposed to be a horror film, but i didn't even shiver during the death scenes. They didn't surpirise me, or scare me, it o me just looked like blood and gore, and cheap effects. It was lame. I just shrugged the horror scenes off as a joke, which it basically was, a poor old man joke. The ending in this film was just horrible, after her ""cousin"" leatherface kills all her friends including her boyfriend, and trying to kill her, she saved him and just killed the cop, and now lives with him. What the heck is wrong with this stupid girls brain. Hello? Your cousin is a seriel killer who wears really faces skitched together on his face, yet you love him? Oh god its just sick. The special effects in this film is just as cheesy and horrible as everything else. I mean is the stuff coming out of the fake bodies surpossed to be blood. Its so fake looking, did anyone try to make good gore. And the chinsaw is surpossed to fly threw the air at the police officer, ya right i can tell it's fake the CGI is horrible. All an All this film is a horrible film that's not even able to scare a 3 year old. This film is just yuck and a horrible start to 2013. F- .

4766378,4,B005LAIIAI,"CHAINSAW is by far my favorite of these horror franchises... Each new chapter is grand... (Even when they're terrible!!).  I just love these characters and this little world solely created to scare the heck out of us.  I found another good movie with a very similar feel (very much an hommage to the chainsaw films) called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roadside-Massacre/dp/B0099SI3LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roadside Massacre</a>.  It too has a great feel and wonderful sense of its own little wrold.  Freaked me out honestly.  If you love Chainsaw Massacre films and are looking for an undiscovered little gem in the horror genre, then check out ROADSIDE MASSACRE.  It's worth the purchase and you'll feel as if you're seeing an all new Chainsaw film too.",1358985600,,805,5.779661016949152
4766379,4,B005LAIIAI,"This is one of the weirdest, unexpected sequels since Halloween 3. The film opens with a quick flashback and picks up exactly where the last one leaves off. The police, along with some vigilantes torch the Sawyer house with the murdering cannibals inside. A little girl is saved and raised by one of the vigilantes. Now that she is grown, (Alexandra Daddario) Heather discovers she is adopted and the sole heir to the Sawyer plantation in Texas.

She travels there with 3 college mates and picks up a person along the way, because the unwritten code of a Texas Chainsaw movie is the hitchhiker/rider. As it turns out, she is not the only heir left and you come to sympathize with the cannibal with a chainsaw.

The film has its share of severed bodies, blood, and gore. The 3D action is climaxed with a chainsaw tossed at the camera. Remember this is a sequel. Keep the expectations low.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. Implied sex. No nudity. Tania Raymonde bra/panties. Alexandra Daddario open shirt cleavage...and how did her shirt become buttoned shut once it was ripped open?",1358121600,3,1074,4.794594594594595
4766380,3,B005LAIIAI,"not a great movie but worth seeing, my biggest problem with it is having a lame rapper that cant act and 2 or 3 rapsongs, rap doesnt belong anywhere but especially in a horror movie! nothing will ever beat the original!",1357516800,,219,4.365853658536586
4766381,1,B005LAIIAI,"Most of the reviews posted are not for this version of Texas Chainsaw. Mine is for the HORRIBLE 2013 version

About as good as Jason Takes Manhattan.

Terrible acting and unrealistic scenes.
The movie tried to be humorous at times but I found myself laughing at the wrong moment and for the wrong reason. Not even a DVD rental.

The director tried to makes us scared of leatherface at one moment but feel sorry for him the next. I pray this is the last attempt at making money off a cult classic.

Here's to hoping the ""re-imaging"" of Evil Dead doesn't ruin the original's legacy the way this did and the way Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 did.

Stay home and eat glass. You'll enjoy it more than this lame movie.",1357257600,4,707,4.407692307692308
4766511,2,B005LAIIAI,"This was not great, this was not enjoyable, and it was not awesome. I originally streamed this movie back in 2013 after it had finished robbing audiences of their money at the theater. I have only seen it once and yet, like eating under cooked chicken, it still remains on my pallet. Just seeing the movie poster for this bad, bad film makes me angry. This is not going to come off sounding nice, but if someone thinks this is good, then they must have damn low standards in movies, or they are a 13 year old kid that thinks a girl running around in a skimpy top, causing them to get an erection equals a good horror movie. Sometimes the 3D is left out of the title on this because, you guessed it, it's no longer available to watch in 3D. It doesn't matter anyway because why would you want your intelligence insulted in another dimension? There are so many reasons this movie is bad, that repeating them is like beating a dead horse. The 4.8 rating on IMDB is well deserved, just jump over there and read some of them. The reviews on Ne***ix, were equally as bad, but it's no longer available there. If this movie were a person, I would kick it's danglers.",1513296000,,1158,4.341013824884793

4766513,1,B005LAIIAI,"This is truly the worst of the TCM films. The only thing that gave it a boost was the 3D gimmick. And even that was bad. Terrible pacing, terrible acting and horrendous plot! How was this even released in theatres?",1511481600,,214,4.375
4766514,4,B005LAIIAI,Good movie enjoy the thrill ride with action and gore the 4 star rating is for the 3D as it was as not so efficient as i expected other then that the movie was awesome,1509580800,,167,3.8
4766515,2,B005LAIIAI,"I would have given it one star, because it was honestly one of the worst and most cheesy films I have ever seen. However, because of its cheesiness and the horrible death scenes/ mess ups, I have decided to give it two stars. It was really funny, in terms of how bad it was. The story was terrible, I mean I was hoping for a horror movie, not a story; a poorly planned on at that. The 2006 version was a lot better in my opinion in terms of horror themed, while the 2017 was much, much better at developing and presenting a story. If you want something for kicks and giggles, or because you are really bored then this would be for you.",1509321600,,635,4.129032258064516

4766587,4,B005LAIIAI,"I was very surprised by this movie and how much i enjoyed it. It has definitely come a long way from the version with Jessica Biel (thankfully). In all honesty, it makes up for that version almost entirely. I was also very surprised to see that several actors from the original 70s movie were brought in to play new roles, including: the original Leatherface, and the only survivor of Leatherface.",1491350400,,397,4.685714285714286
4766588,3,B005LAIIAI,"This is a horror movie that you want to put in on a rainy day and idly watch. Really, the scares are cliche and there is not much character depth built across any of the characters but the film does throw in a twist that hasn't been done before. How you interpret the said twist could either be good or bad. My roommate loved the twist but after discussion, we came to the realization just how silly it was.

Overall, it is better than some of the recent remakes (The Beginning) but really is bogged down by a poor script and cliche scares. Buy the original before buying this one.",1491004800,,581,4.281818181818182

4766791,5,B005LAIIAI,"Me and my daughters LOVE horror movies! As we sat down, to watch this, we were really expecting it to be pretty much like the older (original) one that came out many years ago, but WOW.. were we SURPRISED!! I usually read about and/or watch the trailer to movies before watching them,  but seeing how this was pretty much a known classic I didntand I am SO glad I did NOT with this one! I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else that has not seen it, so all I will say is, it IS definitely a must watch, in my opinion anyway,! Most scary movies usually end in a similar way but not this one. Believe it or not, this was actually  bitter-sweet, and I don't think I have ever seen that in a horror film, especially one that is very well known like this one is. (Well the older one) This is just my opinion, but it was well worth the money I spent to rent it. They took the older version of the movie, spiced it up a little bit, and had a GREAT ending!

4766794,1,B005LAIIAI,How in the world does this movie have any 5 star reviews? The acting and dialogue are terrible. I didn't like any of the characters. The lead female is far too young to be cast for the role she's in. And worst of all the whole storyline is trying to make you feel sympathy for a group of psychos who murder and cannibalize innocent people. They expect you to weirdly see Leatherface as a good guy. I remember the first time I watched TCM and it kept me up at night. That first look at Leatherface opening and slamming that door scared the crap out of me. It's still scary to watch. This movie is done so poorly. It's like an insult to the franchise. It has got to be one of the worst sequels I've ever seen.,1476748800,2,707,4.130434782608695

I still think the 1974 classic ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""(directed by Tobe Hooper) is best but TEXAS CHAINSAW(2013) makes a respectable effort to capture the sickening, gruesome and gory insanity of the '74 movie. Dan Yeager plays ""Leatherface"" quite well in TEXAS CHAINSAW(2013). Recommend this movie as a buy or rental for any die hard fans of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" film franchise!

4767384,5,B005LAIIAI,"I saw the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a drive-in where I grew up in Texas. Six of us in the van, 13 years old each, by ourselves with six girls, no adults needed since we all could drive, anyway. Me and my friends were screaming louder than the girls. Nobody was more afraid than we were. The movie just seemed to jump out of the giant drive-in screen. This version of the famous movie is not as frightening, probably because we've seen so many slasher and horror flicks that rose from the original movie in the last 40 years. Still, though, I think this is the best re-make. It follows and extends the story; it's believable; and the gore factor, while not off the charts, is high, much higher than the original, which didn't have much real gore, only implied gore. I hope the next re-make keeps the lead actress in this film, and builds on her character's relationship with Leatherface, one of her blood relatives who has some problems to deal with.",1433980800,,959,4.517241379310345

Then 19 years later she realizes that her parents stole her cuz she gets a letter from her real grandma. Then she goes to the property and they find leatherface in the basement and her grandma left her a note explaining that she has to take care of him who is...her cousin. The sheriff finds shes in town so they all try to kill her before she finds out they slaughtered their family and the town is corrupt. There is good gore and stuff but thestory  is deep and it isn't the same old stuff recycled. Good movie with good acting.and a good story,lots of emotion is evoked. Everybody dies except leatherface and her cousin. They get even with all that did there family wrong. Not as good as the first remake with Jessica Biel and the second where uncle Monty loses his legs. TCM:The Beginning. But good nonetheless i am a huge leatherface fan.

4768025,3,B005LAIIAI,"so i watched the much maligned texas chainsaw (2014) and...i rather liked it. it's not great, but it it's a well-made light-weight slasher. and it works better when considered in these terms, as opposed to a texas chainsaw massacre movie. but i'll be honest: i'm a sucker for movie plots like this one. it picks up immediately after the original, and one sheriff hooper heads to the sawyer house to follow up on sally hardesty's account of the backwoods cannibal butcher family that we've come to love so dearly. we see a much bigger family than we have before, which includes gunnar hansen and bill mosely. the sheriff tries to fend off a lynch mob, but to no avail. justice will be served, and the whole sawyer clan is burned to the ground. well, except for one. oh yeah, two members of the mob kill a young mother and sneak away with her baby. fast forward twenty years, and the movie is set in motion when the slightly troubled heather, who has a penchant for making sculptures out of bones (interesting), receives notice that she's inherited a mansion in texas. so, she and three friends, and then later a hitchhiker...

well, you get the picture. i liked this flick. it was fun and gory, and the main character was easy to root for, especially as her friends were backstabbing jerks. i really liked the vibe with the sheriff, who was african american, and clearly willing to stand up for cannibal psychos in the face of a lynch mob; this was done in a pleasantly incidental manner, but was resonant nonetheless.

this movie doesn't touch the first two, but it might be in the top four. smooth and easy, with a few laughs thrown in and plenty of bloody chainsawings, texas chainsaw was a hoot.",1418860800,,1698,4.582236842105263

4768543,1,B005LAIIAI,"The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is my all-time favorite horror movie. I liked the first sequel, but loathed the third and couldn't stand the fourth. When it was remade 10 years ago, I actually didn't think it was -that- bad, though the sequel that followed was pretty embarrassing. When I first saw previews for Texas Chainsaw 3D, I couldn't believe two things. One, that they were doing another one of these, and two, that it was being released in January. Come on! January?! I was mildly interested, to see how they did with another TCM installment, and just watched it tonight, since it popped up on the stream.

I think I might hate this more than the third TCM.

Of course, Id have to go back and watch that one again, though I think Im ok with not doing that. Texas Chainsaw 3D felt like it was three hours long, had way too many references to the first movie (youd think thatd be a good thing), is downright laughable in some parts, and the gore is somehow both over AND underdone. Whats really funny is that Tobe Hooper said great things about this movie during its initial release. Its easy to see now that he was only saying that as a result of being paid to do so. There is -nothing- here that will please TCM fans or horror fanatics, aside from a gorgeous leading lady.

The movie begins with a flashback to the day after the events of the first film, with the family house suddenly having more residents, armed and ready to have a shootout with the police after Sally escaped and notified them of what happened. The family actually complies with the sheriff, and is willing to send out Leatherface, but then a bunch of good ol boys show up, set the house on fire and peel caps like bananas. The family goes down, and a baby that was in the home is picked up by one of the rebel flag wavers, to be raised by him and his wife. Cut to the present time, and the baby has grown up into a young woman named Heather. She gets a notice that her grandmother has passed away, and she needs to come to the city of Newt to get her inheritance. Her friends and a stranger tag along. After a little bit of exploring, someone finds a hidden door that leads to a secret wine cellar, and a big metal door. Uh oh.

I don't know where to start with what I didn't like about this movie. To be honest, the whole time I was watching it, I was saying oh my god out loud and rolling my eyes because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I don't love the first sequel, but this movie throws continuity out the window in the beginning when it kills off both grandpa and the cook (played by a guy who actually does look like Siedow). Both were in TCM2, and killing them off here is just one thing to disconnect it from the sequel(s). They also, for whatever reason, keep trying throughout the film to cover up the year the events of the first movie take place. On various graves of the family members, youll see 197  with something covering up the last digit. Residents even mention the shootout of years ago without saying the date. The weird part? The year IS shown on a newspaper about 2/3 through the movie. Why bother hiding the date so much if its shown right here, and its not even a big deal in the first place? It also seems like they tried to hide what year the movie takes place in, with a lot of old cars and the way the kids dress. When a cop pulls out an iPhone, it was finally clear that this takes place in the present day. Whats with all this hiding?!

The number of references to the first movie are plentiful. The way the house Heather inherits looks, people being put on meat hooks, the infamous scraping sound when a flash goes off from the first movie is in here, camera angles that honestly haven't been used much since the first TCM, picking up a hitchhiker, Leatherface ruining a door, and when you see a freezer laying on the flooryes, exactly what you think is going to happen, happens. You cant say that Im spoiling anything because that freezer being there is a spoiler in itself. As for the gore being over/underused, some scenes show way too much while others aren't used effectively. When someones hands get sawed off, the person barely reacts, and the blood looks like red paint. Part of this is because of the poor editing for 3D. Speaking of the 3D, wait until you get a load of the effects. I slumped in my chair when I saw the first big use and did an honest to god face palm. Fortunately, there aren't many 3D moments, but they are pretty distracting to see if you're watching the standard version of the movie. The last thing Ill mention is how drawn-out a scene is where Heather learns about the familys house being burned down. There are so many closeups of the newspaper she reads, that they may as well have just did a close up of the entire page for 2 minutes while you read the whole thing. It jumps between her reading a newspaper and another scene, with each cut to her being small bits of text as the camera rolls over to another section of text.

On the bright side, Alexandra Daddario provided a nice distraction from all the stupidity going on. She did the same thing in another terrible movie she was in not that long ago- Bereavement.

Theres not much more I want to say. Dont watch this movie unless its with a group of friends and you're all making fun of it.",1413676800,5,5305,4.324623115577889

There are two amazing bodied female leads in frequent various stages of undress to keep a guy's visual interest. It gives us a pretty good, scary Leatherface and doesn't do anything to disrespect the character.

4769085,3,B005LAIIAI,"First of all, I will say SPOILER ALERT. Second, I loved how this movie started out as a continuation of the original from the 1970's. The beginning showed glimpses of the first film, and how certain character died. Also, how Sally got away. Then the movie picked up right after where the original left off. Cops, and towns folk flooded the old farm house (looked just like the original) wanting revenge/justice. I loved the beginning. The only noticeable difference was, of course different/younger actors, but also additional family members inside the farm house (like the women with her baby). This minor change in detail was acceptable/ could be looked passed/needed for this movie. However, after the farm house was burned to the ground the movie seemed to take place in a modern day setting, and that is when the movie went down hill.
The acting is not horrible...it's just typical horror movie (especially younger people) sort of acting. How much can you really act when (at the movie's beginning) it's about driving to a new location, partying, and talking about sex/having sex...very typical/clich acting for these types of movie scenes. Some reviewers said that the acting was bad, however I feel that there are times when the movie should have cut from one character to another quicker. This would have helped the believability of the performers. An actor might say his/her lines realistic, but then the camera holds on them for a few seconds too long, as they just stair/ wait for the other person to say his/her lines. Also, the dialogue at times is a little bizarre/aquard.
The story it's self is interesting...not necessarily good, but interesting enough where you'll say ""oh, that's where the director took this movie.. okay."" I feel that this story could have been done better, even if the director had kept the same premise (relative of leather face inharites family home, leather face lives in home, etc.). One crucial flaw of this film was some of the backgrounds/ the home it's self. In all the TCM movies the land is baron, the homes are dirty, or decayed looking/houses you wouldn't want to walk into them. Even with the recent two remakes/revisions of TCM the simple farm house had been turned into a southern style plantation. However, the outside of the manor was cold/ harsh, and the land was baron (feeling of despair/death). The inside of the revised TCM mansion was dark/dirty/ and at times disturbing. However in this new TCM movie the plantation style home/outside is beautiful. It looks more like a mansion that was meant to be put into a love story, and not a horror movie. Especially a TCM movie. The land was lush and green, gardens lovely, the house was warm and inviting (excluding the graveyard/ cellar). This change was not true to the TCM flavor.
The story at times was confusing, and yes, I fast forwarded some of the movie (especially the clich young adult activities).
Here is some additional info.
(1) The house was beautiful, even after the grandmother died...so did this mean that leather face acted as a butler/keeping the house spotless? In the original TCM movie leather face played the mother role (when he put on his apron/female face), so I guess I could see him as a house keeper????? However, I can picture him dusting skulls, but not fine china/expensive furniture.
(2) I did not like how leather face went from being the villain to at a type of victim by the end of the film? I'm sorry, but that town had the right to torch that family for the terrible crimes they had committed, and yet the director seemed to throw in the message that leather face had the right to live/ it was wrong to torch the Sawyer family??? At least that is how it came across to me. That clich idea of ""no one has the right to take away the life of another."" Even though the Sawyer's were monsters.
(3) I don't get why the sheriff at the end let leather face go. Especially concerning the terrible crimes he, and his family had committed
(4) I wish that the director would have portrayed the girl as a more unstable character/ had an abusive childhood...maybe this would explain why she chose to live with/ take care of leather face. This direction of the film also did not make sense, seeing as how leather face had killed the girl's boyfriend, and her two friends. How do you justify taking care of a killer who had just killed the people you had loved (despite him being blood family), and at the same time, he tried to kill the girl herself. I feel that she could have just gone back home to her adopted mother/father. No, there relationship was not perfect, but doesn't it make more sense then living with a cannibal killer?????? Now if the girl had been sexually abused, locked in a closet without food or water as a child, then I could see her living with leather face (at least he would have been nicer to her then her parents). However, this was not the case.

This movie does have many flaws. However, I can't say that it's the worst TCM movie I have ever seen. The worst I feel was Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation. At least with this newer TCM movie the director tried to take the story into a new direction, despite his failure of doing it successfully. It is not a great movie, however it is interesting to watch. Don't expect the same tenseness as the other TCM movies, because it is not there. Very few moments, in my personal opinion, were tense. The only one which stuck out to me was when the girl was hiding in the coffin, and leather face found her/tried to saw her up. However, this to was flawed writing. How can an older leather face (probably in his 60's) hear a girl breathing in a closed coffin/in a vast graveyard?
Also, with other TCM movies the average audience member walks away feeling dirty (dirty from the overall grossness of the film/s). However, in this version you don't get that same gross feeling.
It is a movie worth watching, just to see a very bizarre /week continuation of a classic movie series. And there was some potential to the story (l liked the idea how leather face had new kin that would take care of him), but it just didn't work for how it was made. The movie almost has a sad quality like Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 with the lady on the d-mn white horse/ Myer's kin ends up being a killer sort of sadness. Just like Halloween 2 this movie did not become what it could have been.
Also, why did this TCM movie take place during Halloween? Holidays have never been incorporated with the TCM movies. This inclusion of Halloween was not needed, and should have been left for a horror movie, which needed Halloween to help tell it's story.",1403827200,2,6630,4.61864406779661
4769086,1,B005LAIIAI,"Where do you I begin with this how bad this film is? Ok, lets start off by admitting I am not a TCM fan, nor a casual passer by interested in Leatherface. For me the best slashers are Jason and Freddy, and Lil' Chucky. But I figured I would give this one a go and see if it somewhat might change my opinion on my likings towards TCM movies? And it didn't!

Now, like I said, I'm not a fan of the franchise, but I know the original movie was set in around the late 1960's or early 70's. This movies story goes that after the end scene in the original, this is where this movie is going to kick off from. It starts off interesting, as the cops begin to arrive at the house, and along comes The Bandit with the Duke Boys in tow ready the lynch the family inside the house for what they did to the survivor of the first film. Well, the sheriff can't stop them as they do shoot the house up and burn it to the ground! However, the mother with the bay escaped the house and hide out back in the garage where they are soon discovered by one of the lynch mob, he kicks the mother in the head killing her, and he takes the baby, and raises her with his wife.

Now, it's 2012... and the baby is grown up into a healthy early 20's or so woman... and she.... *screech* What? Something doesn't add up here, it's 2012 but it's only about 20 years after the events of TCM the original? Since when did TCM take place in about 1986-87 or so? The year the actress was born, so I'm going by that. So she was born sometime late 60's early 70's, but was in cryostasis for 10-15 years? Or did perhaps a deleted scene show she was abducted by aliens, and when they brought her back no time has passed for her, but 10-15 years on Earth did? Or is the film maker trying to change the original time line and say this movie is a sequel to the very original, provided you ignore the time period and pretend it took place in the mid to late 80's? Just thinking about this is causing ripples in the space time continuum, but even Albert Einstein and Spock couldn't make this logically make sense.

Anyway. The baby now an adult discovers out of the blue that she was adopted when she receives a letter saying she is the benefactor of her recently deceased grandmothers estate. I guess it's just coincidence that she decides to check the place out before moving onto a concert or something with her friends and driving around in a shaggin' wagon! Homage? No, just lame that they thought it was a nod to the original I think. So they get to her new house, or should I say mansion, and she doesn't even question how she's going to pay bills for such a place? Maybe her granny left her money, but who cares, she has a house... and a hitchhiker... more bad nods... but, is she alone in the house? The plot goes downhill from there and doesn't stop dropping! It drops from so high for so long it makes that whistling sound and then BOOM, bad movie splattered all over your televisions.

It leaves a lot of open questions remaining, but then again, it created them in such a bad idea for a sequel that no one cares if they ever do get answered. The worst thing about this film, is, well, I don't want to do spoilers, but in ways, Leatherface becomes the good guy. Enough said, you should know you don't want to see it now. If that doesn't spell out how bad this film is then don't say I didn't warn you when you do.",1403568000,3,3378,4.168453292496172

The film also represented my first horror film and intro into slasher films.  With that being said I have watched most of the remakes and sequels.  I am not a fan of the sequels, except for this one (Texas Chainsaw), because it makes sense.  I do recommend the movie to those interested in the lore or those who just like the movie series.  However, I do bring some warnings.  The movie fails to bring any scares or even chills.  The actors and actresses did their jobs, and quality is not an issue sense its a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, meaning its not good.  The plot works, but it could have used some editing.  The special effects, setting, and gore was great and high point, next to Alexandra Daddario of course.

4769373,2,B005LAIIAI,"What a horrible movie. Lemme say upfront that I love Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love the original and the 2003 remake. So when I rented this, I expected it to deliver. It didn't. The acting was abysmal to say the least. There was no characterization. I didn't care for any of the (stereotypical) characters. (I somewhat cared for Heather - until she did something mind-boggling.)

*****spoilers****

The part that got me all bug-eyed was when Heather decided to rescue her psychopathic cousin. So basically, Heather forgot all about the horror her cousin made her go through. Not to mention, murdering her friends. Really?! REALLY?!

And why didn't the law-abiding sheriff haul Mr. Psycho to prison or at least, a ward for the mentally insane?

*****End of spoilers******

 The plot was a mess. Speaking of which, Heather (the protag) was born in the 70s, so she's supposed to be in her late 30s. Was the casting director inebriated when he or she cast Alexandara for the role of Heather? Or did Heather use an age-defying cream? All in all, this movie was a failure of epic proportions. What startled me was that Jed (psycho) Sawyer was incredibly fit for a person who's been locked up in the basement for a loooooooong time. He gave me the impression that he could outrun a speeding vehicle. Uhh.... how? It defies the law of fitness.

 There's plenty of hacking and slashing, but there wasn't any suspense. This isn't a keeps-you- glued-to-your-seat kinda movie. I kept on watching to see how it'll end (out of morbid curiosity), which was preposterous to say the least. Not recommended.",1400630400,,1590,4.841328413284133

4769453,1,B005LAIIAI,"Poor Leatherface....he just can't catch a break. This is what, the third or fourth attempt to reboot this series? And this reboot involved both creators of the original, Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, who somehow have managed to forget everything about telling a suspenseful horror film. Well at least ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation"" is no longer the worst film of the series, so there is that.

Kicking this film off, we get a recap of the original film, and we see Sally Hardesty burst through the window of the Sawyer house (never mind that the family's name in the original was Slaughter??!), and she's chased up the road by Leatherface only to escape with the help of a passing truck.

A short time later, the sheriff is headed to the Sawyer farm to bring in Leatherface, aka Jed Sawyer. But before the Sawyer's can hand over Jed, an unruly mob of hillbillies show up and torch the farmhouse, killing almost everyone inside. Loretta Sawyer and her young baby escape out the back, but Verna is mortally wounded. One of the mob finds the baby, finishes off Loretta with a boot to the face, and hands the screaming baby to his wife. The mob celebrates the destruction of the Sawyer family.

Flash forward about 40 years and we see that the baby has grown into a 20 year old woman working in a butcher shop?!? How she aged only 20 years in 40 is a complete mystery?? She learns that she's inherited a house in Texas from her dead grandmother, Verna Sawyer. Learning that she's adopted, she and her boyfriend, plus another couple, head off in a van to check out the new home. Ugh, to make a long story short (too late?), they arrive and Leatherface begins picking them off in typical chainsaw style.

There is just so much to hate about this movie, from the sloppy timeline, to the horrible performances by every actor in the film, to an aged Leatherface limping around the countryside to the poorly done CGI F/X, this was just a horrible, lazy film. Poorly written, poorly scored, poorly directed. I guess the selling point for the film originally was the 3D effect in theaters, but that draw is completely eliminated on the small screem.

I think it may be time to hang up the chainsaw for good, and put this character away now. The original caught lightning in a bottle, and still stands today as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This is just a sad shadow of what that film introduced.",1399420800,,2409,4.56712962962963

4769457,3,B005LAIIAI,"Texas Chainsaw (John Luessenhop, 2013)

While I will stress that this is not a general recommendation, and that of this Tuesday's slate of movies, Texas Chainsaw was by far the loser (the other three were all three and a half star affairs), I didn't seem to hate it nearly as much as everyone else who saw it; I've heard it referred to more than once as the worst horror film of 2013. As someone who sat through Infected, Pandora's Dawn, Zombie Massacre, and Spiders, and who knows I have only touched the tip of this particular iceberg, I'd be willing to bet it's not even in the bottom ten. The main reason for thispossibly the entire reason for thisis Alexandra Daddario, on loan from the Percy Jackson franchise. She takes what is basically the ultimate in generic slasher-movie scripts and makes it into something halfway watchable. We'll get this out of the way right nowokay, there is no way Alexandria Daddario, nor any of the other young-and-beautifuls in this movie, passes for forty (which is the age Daddario's character needs to be if she was a baby in 1973the movie does specify during one scene that it takes place in, or shortly after, 2012). Will you let it go already if you put it down to her character bathing in the blood of virgins or something? 'cause Alexandra Daddario is easily the best thing about Texas Chainsaw. (And where were you guys when Kevin Spacey was playing a guy half his age in Beyond the Sea, huh?)

Plot: we start out not long after the events of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The townsfolk, who have now cottoned to the craziness going on out there, form a lynch mob and head out to get ahold of Leatherface, leaving the town's hapless sheriff (The Fast and the Furious' Thom Barry) in the middle. When things go south, they go south fast. Cut to some of the vigilantes picking through the wreckage. One of them finds one of the Sawyer womenfolk with a newborn. He liberates the baby. Fast-forward to the present day, and through the magic of cinema, that baby is Alexandra Daddario, who's still in her twenties. A cagey lawyer (Office Space's Richard Riehle) has tracked her down and informed her that she is possessed of an inheritance in Texas, so she packs up some friends and heads south. Along the way, in a nod to the original film, they pick up Darryl (Rampage's Shaun Sipos), whose story is not exactly airtight, but they're willing to roll with it. They get to the inheritance, find out it's a massive mansion, and everyone looks thrilled with their lot in life... until folks start disappearing.

Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you this movie is perfect, or even all that good. I do, however, think it has been unfairly maligned; in fact, I would even posit that Texas Chainsaw, the movie Dread Central called the worst horror movie of 2013, is better than Franck Khalfoun's Maniac (the movie they called the best). That's not denying the movie's lapses in logic or occasional horrible dialogue, but pointing out that as a turn-your-brain-off good time, it's amusing. If it weren't attached to the (overrated) Texas Chain Saw Massacre franchise, no one would have given it a second thought, much less proclaimed it the worst horror movie of 2013, a year that saw the release of Tibor Takacs' Spiders, Zombie Hunter, Pandora's Dawn, Zombie Massacre, and Glenn Ciano's Infected, all of which are not fit to lick Texas Chainsaw's boots on any level either in front of or behind the cameraand I have little doubt that's just the tip of the crappy-horror iceberg from 2013.

First off, this film suffers from every problem that modern horror films do. Terrible script, awful acting, stupid characters, and a lack of tension.

I could rant on forever about the flaws I mentioned above, but I won't because what truly makes this film awful is how insulting it is to the original film and the character of Leatherface. Part of what made the first film so great is that you had no clue what was going on with Leatherface and the family of cannibals. We didn't know a thing about them and that made them scary. This film not only trys to build on the character of Leatherface, but make him an ANTI-HERO! That's right guys! This film actually attempts to make Leatherface a good guy!

I found that to be absolutely disrespectful to the first film and this so-called ""Sequel"" ruined everything that made that first one so great! It's a disgrace that this is actually considered a true sequel to a masterpiece of a film. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!",1395446400,,1146,4.526570048309178

As usual, I try to keep these reviews spoiler free - even if there is little to spoil (yeah, guy with chainsaw hacks people up, should be obvious from the cover image).

My favorite part of the movie was the first ten minutes or so which did a good job of looking like it continues right on where the original left off. After that we are left with barely adequate acting from overly sexualized, supremely stupid, annoying, characters. Let me quickly emphasize that these are the stupidest characters - every single one of them - that I have ever seen in a horror movie (and I have seen, literally, hundreds of horrors).

Stupid characters and poor acting aside, the story just plainly didn't make sense. I would love to give a hundred reasons why but those would be spoilers which I wish to avoid. Don't say you weren't warned though.

4770058,3,B005LAIIAI,"I think I have seen about three of these in the franchise and this one had me really confused. In the first one, I believe these are isolated crazy people who attack anybody stupid enough to pick up one of them as a hitchhiker and then come meet the fam.

******SPOILERS*****

In this one, the entire town seems to be stupid and presumably victimized (then why did they even rebuild a town there? Wasn't it deserted during the depression when the meat plant closed? How old is Leatherface anyhow? For an 80 year old he moves pretty fast) even after all the murders, incapable of bringing in one retarded misfit who won't even be able to stand trial, yet everyone is prepared to shoot everyone else over it.

The theme seems to be ""family"" which apparently means you can do anything you like as long as you are related, like harboring killers, eating people, etc.  So anyway, you have two bunches of rednecks who like to kill people for one reason or the other  who apparently co-exist in this small town called Newt. So one of these people goes back to claim an inheritance and they start talking about Sawyers and Carsons and I had to look this up because I don't even remember anybody called Carson in the other ones or what the deal is between them. (SAW-yers, geddit?) I don't know why Leatherface is even living in the Carson house like a tame troll and BTW that whole idea is stolen from HP Lovecraft, a much better writer.

So then of course Leatherface murders a bunch of people almost immediately and they do the dumbest things trying to escape him ever. Did that girl just throw the shotgun away after the first shot? Why did she not keep shooting, and why don't they just shoot the gas tank on the chainsaw and firebomb him?  Then they jump in the car and once they get it going and Leatherface is closing in on them from behind, what do they do?  Instead of backing up over him at full speed (maybe several times and abandoning it and setting it ablaze too) they attempt to crash the car through the locked electric gates.  Thereby ruining the car and allowing him plenty of time to get to them and carve them up at leisure while they are knocked out or immobilized. I know horror movies are full of people going into dark basements alone and ""why did they do that?"" moments but this movie really had more than its fair share of such moments.

And like they would really leave the girl in a room unguarded with a big box marked 'EVIDENCE"" next to her.  It's not like they need her to lead them to him -- they know exactly where he is. And as another reviewer has said she would not read the letter until the movie is over.  It was also pretty strange to me that after L-face has killed her BF she pairs up on his side.  Um, ok they did shoot up your family and burn down your house but you know, your family killed and ate people and um, he did kill your friends. And your BF.  Kill your adoptive parents if you must Edith (but for them you would have no life at all, even a crummy one) but what the hell did her friends and BF do to her? NOTHING.

Also really so tired of that scene where the dumb girl (it's always a lone girl who survives in these Chainsaw movies) gets into a car with a seemingly innocent policeman who takes her right back to the butcher's shop because he isn't what he seems to be, or he's RELATED.  I'm pretty sure this has been a movie cliche since DW Griffith, but in Chainsaw it only shocked me in the first film. REALLY shocked me. It's a theme that's been exploited in many horror films since as well.  But EVERY Chainsaw movie has this scene. So why do they keep getting in the car?  And why do we keep watching these movies?  I keep hoping some writer will take it in a new direction but they never seem to get out of the loop. At least there is slightly less gore in this one.

Oh yes and the ""do your thing Cuz!"" line was ridiculous as were many other things. Get out your tap shoes...oh no...",1392595200,,3938,4.2745625841184385

4770064,5,B005LAIIAI,"The Independent Movie Database gives the Texas Chain Saw movie an overall 4.8 out of a possible 10 Star Rating. I did not read any of the reviews. I feel viewers under-appreciated the work. The director, John Luessenhop, does not have a slew of credits Texas attached to his name, however, I thought in trying to keep with the original Chain Saw film, he pulled off a worthy sequel. There were more of these films than I originally thought.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974 (Marilyn Burns)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2, 1986 (Dennis Hopper)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Next Generation, 1995 (Renee Zellweger)
Leatherface: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre III, 2003 (Kate Hodge)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Remake), 2003 (Jessica Biel)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Beginning, 2007 (Jordana Brewster)
The Texas Chain Saw, 2013 (Alexandra Daddario)

Some big names tied to the franchise, no doubt. Anyway . . .

The movie picks up where the original 1974 movie ends. Leatherface let Marilyn Burns escape the farmhouse. He returns as Sheriff Hooper arrives to investigate. The Sawyer family is holed up inside, protecting the simple-minded family member mostly responsible for the mass killing spree that turned their basement into an animal-like slaughterhouse.

Like any good redneck town, an angry mob of vigilante civilians pull up. Pickup trucks and shotguns. Unable to control the mob alone, Hooper is forced to watch the events spiral out of control. A shootout ensues and the farmhouse is torched. Everyone except an infant survives.

Present time: Heather Miller (portrayed by Alexandra Daddario) receives word that a grandmother she didn't know existed has passed away. In the will, Miller inherits a huge house in Texas. She and her boyfriend Ryan (Trey Songz), Nikki (Tanya Raymonde), Darryl (Shaun Sipos), and a hitchhiker decide to stay the night in the house.

Things fall apart fast from there. A chain saw wielding killer is on the loose, the five people in the house are not safe, but neither are the people of the town. Burt Hartman (Paul Rae), didn't just lead the mob to murder years and years ago -- he is now the Mayor. He will go to any lengths to protect the town, and the people in it. Even if that means doing unthinkable things to protect and keep buried the sins of the past.

Miller, learning that she is actually a Sawyer, is in a desperate race to assemble the puzzle pieces of her new found heritage, while fighting to keep herself and her friends alive. Can she succeed at uncovering and exposing truths that have been hidden for so long? Or will she loose herself, and her life, trying?

Quite sexy midriffs and long legs decorate the screen, but no nudity. There is some bad language. A ton of gruesome and detailed violence. Horrific mutilation scenes. All on par for a classic Chain Saw film.

Pretty good acting, believable dialogue and suspense kept me from Facebooking and Tweeting. Texas Chain Saw is a mix of slasher film coupled with a suspense/mystery. It was both intense and scary. I enjoyed the actual story. The only thing I hope -- no -- the only thing I pray, is that this is it. This is the last one. But I've prayed that prayer before. It rarely comes true. Still, I've enjoyed all but one in the series of Chain Saw movies (Renee Zellweger, sorry). I give this movie 5 out of 5 Stars.

4770275,5,B005LAIIAI,"I was not expecting much when I first sat down to watch this. And that is because I misunderstood what I was watching, exactly.

I thought I was going to watch yet another bad re-make of the original 1974 film. But I very quickly realized that someone had decided to do, what the 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' franchises did with their sequels. Meaning that this Texas Chainsaw follows the events that took place directly after the rescue of the lone, female survivor of Leatherface, from the first film.

This movie, to me, was not just about senseless violence. It delved into the background of Leatherface's family. And many times when you deal with 'family', there is no rhyme or reason to anything. Decisions are made that don't make practical sense: that being that Leatherface either belonged in prison or some criminal institution for the mentally unhinged, and many people who might have had the power to make such a thing happen, decided against such a decision.

The story also touched on vigilantism, and what can happen when ordinary people, who don't think that the police are doing their jobs, jump in to matters that are better left to law enforcment. This film actually had me rooting for both sides here.

I would not mind seeing a third film to this franchise, with the same lead actress and the Leatherface character. I truly feel as if there is a lot more story here to be told. And I would watch it again in a heartbeat.",1391904000,3,1446,4.658823529411765

On the other side I found myself reaching for the STOP button only to pull my hand back slowly and keep on watching. Dont you hate movies like that?

4770546,4,B005LAIIAI,"I have to begin by saying I was surprised by how much this film did not suck. Horror movies are a genre in which 90 to 95% of the material offered is bad, and that figure rises to 99% when dealing with remakes, reboots, prequels and sequels. TEXAS CHAINSAW is in some measure all of these things, so I was expecting about as much quality as youd find in the sluice gate at a slaughterhouse. As it turns out, its actually pretty goodif you can get past the gristle.

TEXAS CHAINSAW begins just hours after the events of the 1974 original left off, explaining what happened to the cannibalistic Sawyer clan after one of their would-be victims escaped and contacted authorities. Cut to today, where the gorgeous Alexandra Daddario, her boyfriend Trey Songz, her slutty best friend (Tanya Raimone), and his buddy (Karam Malicki), are setting out on a roadtrip to Texas. Seems A has discovered that her just-deceased grandmother has left her a house there. Daddario is in a state of upset because in receiving the house she has also just discovered that she was actually adopted, and that her parents are therefore not her real parents. Driving south, the gang adds a handsome hitchhiker (Scott Eastwood) to their group,  thus demonstrating that, like most horror-movie characters, they don't have a helluva lotta sense.  Eventually the crew arrives at the supposedly empty Plantation-style house, set on walled-in grounds in the woods, and are given the keys by a shifty-acting lawyer (Richard Riehle). Ignoring a warning to read grandmas will BEFORE they go inside, the gang soon discovers two unpleasant facts: 1) the house is NOT empty, and 2) the townsfolk know something about the history of both the houses hidden occupant and A.D. herself, things they are very keen the gang not discover. What follows involves pretty much what youd expect from an entry in this franchise: screaming, running, chainsaws, meat-hooks, dismemberment, face-peelings, face-wearings, salad bowls full of severed fingers, chainsaws, gratuitous but welcome semi-nudity, small-town intrigue, buckets of blood, complex family ties, and more chainsaws. If you have never seen one of these movies, this is as complete a tutorial as you would need  you simply won't look at the McCullough in the tool shed the same way again. Nor should you. After all  the saw is family!

As I said, and despite a lot of very bad reviews  the Tomameter reading on this flick was a sickly 19% --this is a surprisingly not-bad film. The acting is good all the way around, the mounting tension is nicely balanced by sudden and vicious outbursts of blood and gore (disgusting, but not over-the-top), and the film is professionally lit and shot once the inept opening is finished. The rip-roar of the chainsaw becomes gut-tightening as the movie goes on, evoking a sort of Pavlovian fear-response from the viewer, and there is something just genuinely horrible about that hulking guy in the basement in the human face mask. Gunnar Hansen is far more effective physically playing Leatherface than Kane Hodder ever was as Jason Voorhees, and despite his age still knows how to ply his grisly trade with a young mans vitality, sawing apart Volkswagen vans and lumbering through State Fairs after his prey with the single-minded focus of a guided missile. And to sweeten the deal, Daddario is so f-ing other-wordly gorgeous and has such a hot body I was just mesmerized by her presence from the first frame. And there is an easter egg after the credits which is gruesomely funny to behold, if a bit over the top.

Now, when I say its not bad, I don't mean its perfect. There are numerous problems with the story, starting with its clumsy and badly-written opening, in which the film tries to evoke some sense of sympathy for the Sawyers  a vicious, inbred, cannibalistic group of sadistic murderers who make ornaments out of their victims  and finishing with the movies climax, which, following the moronic trend of modern horror, also tries to make Leatherface look like a sympathetic character and completely rapes the characterization of Daddario's character. (Blood may be thicker than water, but chainsaw grease is thicker than blood.) Furthermore, every twist in the script is something you can see from three miles off, and it is possible with close to 100% certainty to figure out who is going to live and who is going to die the moment they are introduced. As with all horror movies, the police behave with lombotomized stupidity, and as with all CHAINSAW films going back to '74, the chainsaw itself is called upon to do things it could never actually do in real life, becoming the bad-guy equivalent of the gun that doesn't need to reload. Finally, and without unleashing a spoiler, I can say that the dark secret the town is trying to protect would in real-life have been the source of endless boasting. Nobody would try to hide their participation in what the townsfolk did to the cannibals living in their midst. They would put it on freaking YouTube!

This, then, is TEXAS CHAINSAW, 90 minutes of tension and grue delivered to you in a surprisingly effective package, with a couple of extremely hot women to sweeten the deal. It won't be competing for Greatest Horror Movie of All Time,  but by and large it does what it sets out to do, which is remind you that if you are in Texas and you hear a chainsaw start up, you should probably keep driving until you hit Nova Scotia.",1389744000,6,5438,4.841765339074273

This movie is god awful. It's riddled with bad horror movie issues (like kids that make bad judgment calls like not bothering to explore a new found mansion past 3 rooms before starting to party).  That's not a deal breaker, but still . . . odd to me because I know I got the lay of the land anytime I was in a new party setting lay a guest house during spring break.

For me, the biggest problems were:

1) It felt more like Halloween that a Texas Chainsaw movie.  The character learns who her family is and seemingly turns crazy after years of seemingly having proper morals.

2) The biggest issue, it starts in 1974, the lead character is a baby. Then it shoots ahead in years and the lead character looks to be in her 20s. But things don't appear to be taking place in the 90s like I'd expect. The clothes aren't right, the music kids listen to is more like 2013. Heck, a police officer even uses what looks like an Iphone. So . . . it's present day? So why does the lead character, who should be about 40 look more like she is in her early 20s? Even the adults from the intro of the 1974 scenes look way too young to be their 2013 counterparts. People that were maybe 25 (at best) in 1974 look more like 50 than 65 or 80. Not to mention you have to wonder how dangerous the slasher character would be after 40 years, assume he was 20 in 1974 . . . how strong would he be at 60? The only good thing this movie has going for it are the scenes with Alexandra Daddario's wasit line . . . and that's pretty much present through out the whole movie. So much so, that despite being visually appealing . . . it's done way too much.

3) I also thought it was just plain tacky how the vigilante township is portrayed as the nut jobs or villains.  Ugh, nice try but not buying it.",1389484800,,1790,4.108882521489972

4770685,5,B005LAIIAI,"this movie is a train wreck no doubt. I plan to argue that the fact that it is a train wreck is the best part. first of all this is a sequel to the 1970s movie which was made 39 years ago, the lead of this movie is 25 years old but was born 39 years ago, HOW!? obviously the film makers don't care and are fully aware of it. this absurdity only sets the tone for what is a hilarious spectacle, Heather Miller the main protagonist is oblivious through out the movie of her boyfriend's affair with her best friend but not 30mis later with in the story's time after he dies and her friend is missing she neither mourns his death nor does she continue to look for her friend. the sub-plot goes nowhere, it is never resolved and her friend is accidentally killed by a cop. It's seemed as if Heather completely changed after she found out she was a Sawyer and the story did too. About that cop that killed her friend, he is the thing that drives the massage the movie takes place now and not 1999 like Heather's age would suggest. He was using an iPhone 5 to perform his investigation and if he hadn't they could've sold the movie as taking place in 1999 so the timeline would fit. The dialog is also laughable with lines like ""Do your thing coss!"" at the end. but it is that kind of dialog that makes this so special, this movie is not for everyone but I you are a hardcore horror fan not just a ""Normie"" that wants some scares you could appreciate this. add that this was planed as a 6 movie soulless money-grab that will most likely never happen.",1389052800,,1543,4.216216216216216

I love each Texas Chainsaw film starting with the very first all the way through to Next Generation, The Remake, and THE BEGINNING. But when the trailer was released for this film I just didn't like what I was seeing. Long story short, I figued why not give it a shot with an open mind. Well...here is the breakdown.

Pros
-Two scenes worth atleast renting the movie. One being the chase through the town fair, and the graveyard scene.
-Some old friends of the past series return for a quick few minutes. Gunner and Bill.
-Cool dvd cover art

Cons
-Some CGI blood
-Hot Young Bodies, nobody gets naked?!
-Terrible storyline
-Terrible ending
-Action doesnt start for 45 minutes
-doesnt add to the series, just takes away.

I could go on and on but if you love the series it won't kill you to rent it and find out that it sucks, just don't blind buy it. I actually heard they are making another. Which the idea of another film is more frightening than this movie. The series cant go in a good direction from here, because its made for kids of a new time. In this movie, you have the rapper, the whore, the magazine model, the chick from the craft (joke for those who are slow), and just one bad character after the next.

They were all one dimensional and not too bright.

Who were all of those people in the house??? There was no explanation as to how a burnt down house turns into a big clean house with expensive things. Who the grandmother was, and why all the family tombstones were out back....And for Heather to turn evil once hearing the back story was nothing short of stupid and unbelievable.. There was absolutely no suspense and not a single reason to care about anyone in this.

The filmmakers weren't going for a big blood bash and have all those special effects thrown in but they were looking to continue the 1974 story line. Which i think got perfected to say so myself... But thats all the people want nowadays is the gore and not a good plot or twist behind the whole thing... They should just bring the old scare horror movies back but in today's society i don't think that is going to happen and in my opinion there was an enough gore to get me through the movie as i am an horror fan ...

P: Picking up directly where the original 1974 cult classic left off, a young woman travels with her friends in tow to the backwoods of Texas to claim her inheritance, a house with hidden passageways and her long lost cousin - Leatherface.

As someone wisely pointed out, take a good look at the horror films that have been released in January in recent times - The Devil Inside, The Unborn, The Rite, White Noise, Hide and Seek, The Hitcher (2007), My Blood Valentine 3D, etc. Texas Chainsaw 3D is no exception to the rule that if it is a horror film and it's coming out in January, it's probably going to be a sub-par genre effort.

Texas Chainsaw 3D is a pointless continuation / sequel that serves up yet another group of young people for slaughter at the hands of Leatherface. This one goes through the usual paces, but without any energy or gusto. There's a plot twist in the film's final act that is going to anger some and intrigue others, but by then it's too little, too late. [R] 92 mins.",1383782400,,1286,4.68141592920354

4770763,1,B005LAIIAI,"Texas Chainsaw (2013), directed by John Luessenhop. 92 minutes

Plot:

Picking up directly after the events of Tobe Hooper's landmark 1974 ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" the latest, ADHD-titled entry in the franchise, ""Texas Chainsaw,"" finds the Sawyer family somehow multiplying (?) and including, of all things, a young baby who will grow up to be strong-headed but troubled nevertheless. When Heather (Alexandra Daddario) finally comes of age, which by all calculations means she should be about 40, not only does she have the youthful appearance of a 21 year old, but she has also unwittingly inherited her family's (mis)fortune, which includes her crazy cousin Leatherface. A road trip with a group of friends naturally ends in tears and a little bloodshed.

Writing and Directing:

One of the writers, Adam Marcus, brought you the cinematic masterpiece, ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday,"" so you know this one's gotta be good. No wait, that other thing. Bad. Very bad. While ""Jason Goes To Hell"" could be at least entertaining at times for turning its franchise's conventions on its head while delivering buckets of gore in the process, ""Texas Chainsaw"" is an exercise in redundancy. The plot borrows from too many horror films of days past, and rather than pay homage or at least wink at the camera, the film-makers have the nerve to play it straight, as if the tired concepts they introduce are somehow their own. John Luessenhop's direction is nothing beyond serviceable. The film looks OK for what it is, but given virtually nothing to work with, the film can't help but look and feel like substandard direct-to-video fare, which it truly is.

Cast:

A young rapper by the name of Trey Songz who has never been in a film before is featured prominently in the cast, so you know that the producers took the utmost care in hand-selecting a roster of seasoned actors who could emote and evoke true fright in their performances. Or, you know, that other thing. Songz (Lord, it pains me to even type that) isn't even the least of the casting issues, as most of the other actors look like they just stepped off the set of some Jim Wynorski-directed skin-flick for Cinemax (and not in a good way). The aforementioned Daddario in the lead role does the best with what she's given, but even cameos from franchise luminaries such as Bill Moseley, Gunnar Hansen and Marilyn Burns don't do much to breathe life into the proceedings. The always reliable Richard Riehle makes a comforting appearance and Thom Barry does a good enough job as the town sheriff, but that's about it.

Music:

Nothing memorable, but no songz from Trey Songz (as far as I could tell), so that's a plus, right?

The Bottom Line(s):

The ""Chainsaw"" series of films has to be without a doubt one of the most confusing and frustrating franchises in the annals of horror history. ""Texas Chainsaw"" does little more than rub salt in the wound.

Lesson Learned:

If you're writing a movie, at least get your math right. 38 years have passed between 1974 and 2012. Please make sure your main character (you know, the one that your credibility hinges on) reflects the appropriate age.",1381017600,,3149,4.843575418994414

4770805,5,B005LAIIAI,I really like how the movie starts where the original left off and gives more background as the movie goes on. Any horror movie fan will love this movie  and if you haven't watched the original you  will want to go back and see it.,1379635200,2,231,4.111111111111111

I must say the bucket was empty. Did it have gore, you bet , but after that this movie is a waste. Ok, at beginning to be fair, the way they opened the movie, I thought there was some potential but after that ,it just fell apart. Who ever came up with this story line ,should be laughed out of Tinsel town . When we got to the last few minutes of the story where Alexandra Daddario, and leatherface create an alliance ,that's when I said you've got to be kidding.

Now with that said, I really liked this TCM movie, it was a great installment to the franchise, I liked it about as much as the remake and I liked the characters in the movie. I'm not going to go in to so much of what this movie is about, because if you're a Texas Chainsaw fan, you basically already know what it's about, but anyway, this movie really did well on expanding the story from the first original TCM movie.

4770884,1,B005LAIIAI,"For the fans who have seen all the other Texas Chainsaw films, I warn you, this movie was worse then Texas Chainsaw 4: The Next Generation!

I am a HUGE Texas Chainsaw fan! The original '74 Massacre is a psychotic voyage into madness and having seen all the sequels and re-makes, I wasn't expecting this to keep pace with the original, but hopefully keep pace with the last 2 re-makes. I went and saw it as soon as it came out and was horrified. Not in a good way! This movie was pure unadulterated crap! With the last re-makes my biggest complaint was that they used models as their cast (the original had normal looking people which I think adds to the intensity because you can picture this happening to you and your friends) so I wasn't very worried when they cast a rapper or a bunch of ""pretty"" people before I went to see it. As I was watching it I had to choke down my bile!! Other reviewers mentioned that during the action sequences it looked like they stopped and fixed their hair and make-up after every scene. That's very true but almost to a Twilight level! The main character even has sparkly eyed contacts in (very Twilight!). The characters they play in the movie are poorly written. The main character is supposed to be grieving the death of a relative that until a couple days ago she didn't know she had. Then since she has to meet with the lawyer and claim the estate, she decides that she should take her friends along and party! When they get there, the lawyer knows that Leatherface is alive and in the house, but instead of telling/warning her he figures it'll be better to let her find him on her own.....and in turn all her friends get killed. The plot just kind of goes away towards the end [SPOILER] when she finds out that vigilante justice (a lynch mob) killed the whole Sawyer family except Leatherface. She decided that blood is thicker than water (because she was also a Sawyer that was adopted out after the massacre) and decides to forgive Leatherface for killing all of her friends and boyfriend! What??!! I guess you did see it coming (although while watching you're thinking they wouldn't have her side with Leatherface, maybe just out-crazy him or something) all through this piece of crap they kept on mentioning that the main character has such a dark mind. Also very Jr High, emo, Hot Topic! Anyway, the town covered up the lynch mob and when it's found out that Leatherface is still alive some of the original participants decide to try and finish the job. The mayor led the mob back in the day and the sheriff (who was a deputy at the time) didn't like it then and doesn't like it now. So when the mayor and the sheriff find Leatherface and see that the main character (sorry that I keep referring to her as ""the main character"" but this movie was so awful and forgettable that I honestly can't remember what her name was in the movie) has decided to protect and care for him, the sheriff shoots the mayor and lets the cannibal serial killer off the hook. What a twist! They make the mob that killed the family of cannibal murderers the real bad guys! Yeah, pure gold there huh?! I was sitting next to a couple of kids who couldn't have been more than 15 and not only were they not at all scared, they were as bored as I was!! When a 15 year-old can accurately predict what's going to happen and then get angry about being right, you have to wonder who the hell wrote this POS??!!! Anyone who claims this was scary has mental problems. Anyone who thinks the story held water or wasn't a COMPLETE waste of time is an idiot! This was just a shameless attempt at milking a proven horror series for a quick buck. Also, as big of a fan of horror movies as I am (so this kind of pains me), here's a big SCREW YOU to Fangoria Magazine for promoting and endorsing this movie!!",1377561600,3,3813,4.408510638297872

I thought Jason X would remain the worst horror film I've ever seen but it appears that the director and writer of this film felt someone should aim low and shoot for the title of worst horror film.  Had there not been some decent 3D effects and two scares I didn't see coming, they easily could have taken the title from Jason X.  So let's talk about what makes this film so bad.  For starters, when the acting is worse than Showgirls, you've really gone out of your way to make a terrible movie.  The story is terrible and at times makes no sense.  The saving grace is the 3D effects but they still fall short of Final Destination 5 and My Bloody Valentine 3D.  At $14, this film honestly is not worth the investment.

The plot involves heather a relative of the sawyer family who was long lost.  She brings her friends to party and meet her new house. She also picks up a thief hitchhiker who robs them blind. From this point it was good but after this it goes downhill fast. Basically without spoiling it the first 5 or so deaths are traditional txm but no chainsaw then it just gets weird and awful. She relieves that her cousin is leather face and that pretty much everyone in town wrongfully killed his family. And she decides to side with him even though he killed all her friends!!

4770918,2,B005LAIIAI,"Ignoring all the sequels (and a remake and a prequel) previously made, ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" (2013) is a direct sequel to ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974). It's great to see some of the original's players again in a cameo role, including Marilyn Burns, John Dugan and Gunnar Hansen, plus Bill Moseley from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" (1986).

But the latest entry in the franchise is not about them. Picking up after the events of the original, ""3D"" shows us what happened to the Sawyers, and then jumps to the present, where a young Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario) receives a curious document. Heather learns that she has inherited a house in Newt, Texas, and travels to the place with her friends to discover the secret behind the closed iron door.

This is not a bad idea to start off a new story arc. However, there are so many problems about ""Texas Chainsaw 3D."" The biggest one is Leatherface's transition from a feared killing machine to a somewhat sympathetic character. The story is not really convincing, especially when you remember what Heather has to go through before learning the truth about him.

Even if you can ignore this, and the fact that about forty years after the original's events Heather looks too young, you still have to sit through the horror movie clichs. There are lots of gore, but not much suspense.",1374451200,4,1343,4.780172413793103

4770993,1,B005LAIIAI,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie has so many plot holes that it is not even funny. In the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1 & 2 it was made clear the Sawyer family turned to cannibalism because they lost their jobs at the slaughter house, and were too poor to buy food. Now it turns out that they were loaded with money all along. So why did they turn to cannibalism if they had money for food, I don't get it?

Second, the movie starts off in 1974 with the lead character Heather as a baby, so that would make her 38 in this film, which is odd because she is obviously in her early twenties, setting the film in the mid 1990's. But if the movie takes place in the mid 1990's then why does one of the most important scenes in the film involve an I-phone G4, they did not exist untill 200x. So when does this movie take place 1990's or 200x?

Third, it was established in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre that Leatherface is a normal human with down syndrome, he does not have superhuman strength like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers, yet here we are watching a 65 year old Leatherface running down twenty year olds, and manhandling them like rag dolls. Oddly, at the end of the film he is getting beaten up by an old guy; seems rather inconsistent if you ask me.

Without a doubt, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) was a better follow up to the original than Texas Chainsaw 3D, because it tied in to the original film so well, and Chop-Top was a more interesting character than Heather. Don't buy this piece pf crap, and buy Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) instead.",1373673600,10,1617,4.365448504983389

4771045,3,B005LAIIAI,"""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is not a particularly inventive or frightening horror movie.  Let's make that clear from the start.  A lot of that comes from the danger of any horror sequel -- what was successful due to being surprising, then becomes an expectation and expectation is the enemy of suspense and horror in most cases.  Some of it may also come from studios wanting to churn these movies out without maybe the biggest regard for quality.

Am I saying ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is a bad movie then?  Of course not.  It's a perfectly serviceable horror movie sequel with just a gust of creativity in the story that many sequels don't have.  It's certainly better than the dry and unlikable remakes previously foisted upon us by Michael Bay's production company in the early part of the century.

""Chainsaw"" starts off where Tobe Hooper's original left off, ignoring previous sequels (probably with good reason) and making a quick knot to tie off the loose ending of that classic picture.  Now, there's a bit of a problem here too, similar to ""Halloween"" in that the original ending is crazy and clever and unresolved, downright history, so simply starting the story at the next moment kind of takes the air out of that.  But, whatever.  It shows the seemingly permanent fate of the original 'family,' (with a brief appearance of original Leatherface, Gunnar Hansen as one of the relatives.)  And also leaves with a baby being taken from the family to be raised by more regular folks.

That baby grows up and, of course, becomes the star of our picture.  We jump ahead to her college years where we learn quickly that she wasn't exactly dealt a winning hand, even if she wasn't raised by cannibals.  When she learns her real grandmother has died -- and that she was adopted by means of deduction -- she takes off with her friends to find what she's inherited and, maybe along the way, who she really is.  Once the foursome, our main girl, her boyfriend, her BFF and her new beau hit the road and pick up a hitchhiker for good measure, we're on the road to having a lot of bad things happen to these otherwise harmless kids

The house Heather inherits is the house from the original picture, the one that Leatherface hid in and did his unspeakable deeds.  The kids start nosing around and, let's be honest, I don't need to start telling you what happens next.  I will say this: whereas the original movie was a slow burn, this movie takes the opposite tempo, not spending too much time with the kids mingling and only dangling the possibility of angsty-character stuff, most of which gets bumped out of the way when chainsaws start revving.

And the movie does go in a different direction than you expect, one which I won't spoil.  It doesn't entirely work, but it's interesting and credit is due for doing more than JUST sending a bunch of kids to Leatherface's house to die.

Alexandra Daddario is Heather, the long lost Leatherface family member.  Horror movies always cast pretty people, and this movie's no different, but even given that Daddario sticks out, maybe it's because she actually can act or maybe she's just that pretty.  If a few years she's the next big thing in Hollywood, I wouldn't be totally surprised.  It wouldn't be fair to say she carries the movie because it's carried more by the promise of violence, but she certainly keeps it going and keeps a plot that becomes more unusual than it seems it should credible and involving.

""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" has a lot of what we want from horror movies --  a legacy of horror, a monster seemingly back from the dead, small town people covering up a secret and all sorts of people you think you can trust but then regret doing so.  And bloodshed, lots and lots of bloodshed.

If you wanted to see this movie, you should enjoy it.  If you're like me, you might even enjoy it a little more than you should.  Just because.",1371859200,3,3876,4.614598540145986
4771046,3,B005LAIIAI,"The newest reboot, TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D (2012), ignores all the films in the series except the first original one and was the #1 U.S. boxoffice draw the first week of its theatrical release in January of 2013 (It was delayed from its original October 2012 theatrical release date due to the MPAA slapping an NC-17 Rating on it). It was savaged by critics, but since when did that stop anyone from seeing a film? I watched the Unrated version on VOD (so far, the only way to see the Unrated version in the U.S., since the DVD and Blu-Ray are of the theatrical R-Rated version) and it's pretty good, but not necessary at all (There are some gaping plot holes, especially regarding the timeline). It uses footage from the original Hooper film (which ends with new footage of the entire Sawyer clan being gunned down by the town's citizens, except for a female baby, who is kidnapped by a white trash married couple and raised in another state under the name Heather, unaware of her roots) and then switches to the present day, where Heather (Alexandra Daddario), inherits her unknown dead grandmother's mansion, not knowing that Leatherface lives in a locked apartment in the basement. Even though Leatherface (played by Dan Yeager) kills a lot of people (one is chainsawed in half while hanging on a meathook), the film makes him seem like he has a much more emotional core than the other films and even the police department head, Sheriff Hooper (Thom Barry), lets him and Heather get away with murdering those responsible for killing the Sawyer clan decades ago, including the town's mayor, Burt (Paul Rae), who organized the townspeople for the past Sawyer massacre (He has his hands chainsawed off and he falls into an industrial meat grinder). Look for cameos by Gunnar Hansen, Bill Moseley and Marilyn Burns in the new footage and a funny stinger after the end credits roll.

4771093,5,B005LAIIAI,"I must say that this is one of the best Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remakes, by far. I liked the one with Jessica Biel, however it wasn't what I had expected in a remake. This one picks up were the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre left off in the 1970's version. Except it is a modern version with a bit added on to the story. This remake made sense to me. It didn't leave me sitting there questioning who are these people in the movie, where did they come from and why are they randomly at this creepy house in the middle of no where...like the other movies did. Yes none of the Texas Chainsaw movie's run together smoothly or make a bit of sense, ( Which group of horror movies that you know of do ? None that I can think of...lol ) However, this version adds to the story and put pieces of the puzzle together for you. Yes, the Texas Chainsaw movies are all also different takes on the story, but this take was a refreshing addition to the piece. In this version of the movie it shows you not only the gory and scary Leatherface we have all grown to fear and love, but it also shows his softer side and his love and loyalty for family. It shows him as a horror icon, a serial killer, but most of all as a person. A person that is not a monster that you can't hurt or kill, but a person that really is a person and can absolutely be killed and hurt, just like us. In all my opinion is this is definitely a horror and Texas Chainsaw Fan must see and buy. It completes the perspective on this group of movies and Leatherface.

My husb and I went to the movies and saw this one and I liked it ok but wanted to buy
it and watch it again. When I got this one we watched it and I realized I didn't like
it near as much as the other one with J. Beil in it. This one could have been much better
but it was kind of ...well, flat. The main actress in it reminded me of one of the gals in ""The
Craft"", the scary one, and she was really interesting and a good actor for sure but the other
characters seemed to disappear with a lack of attaching to them. In other words, when they were
killed it was like, OK whatever... not like in J. Biel's where you felt bad when the hunky boyfriend

Again, if you can't get passed the aforementioned plot holes, don't even bother renting it, it'll just be a waste of your precious time.

I actually liked the 2003 'revisioning' myself and consider myself a hardcore fan of the series. So many plot holes in this sequel that is just nonsensical. The most talked about has to be the genius behind the storyline which puts our heroine in her early 20's instead of her late 30's which would be accurate. I found the acting and the feel of the movie to be no more than second rate at best. Already talk of a sequel..god help us..,1370217600,2,547,4.425742574257426

4771205,2,B005LAIIAI,"If you are like me, then you were probably pretty happy and excited when you first heard that the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie would not follow the remake (which was a lot better than this), nor the prequel to the remake, or be another reboot/remake, but would go back as being a sequel in the original franchise. It was a great idea and was hope that maybe other iconic horror franchises would get over the remake crap and go back to their original series. If they do, let's hope they are better than this.

This movie is a direct sequel to the classic 1974 original film. It opens right where the original left off and then picks up years (never identified as how many years, which will serve for serious continuity issues that we will get to later) later. Young Heather (the incredibly sexy Alexandria Daddario), learns that she has inherited a house from a grandmother she never knew she had. She, along with her friends, decide to stop in Texas to settle the matter while on their way to New Orleans. Little does Heather know that she is not who she thought, and that the town has a dark secret....one that she is about to find she inherited in the dark basement of her grandmother's house.

That's the gist, and we don't need to dwell on the fact that Leatherface is there and all hell then breaks loose. With these movies, a suspension of belief is always needed, and that's fine. I couldn't care less. It's all in fun. But here, there is such a problem with continuity that it just bugs me because it was so sloppily done. If Heather is supposed to be the baby in the opening scenes from 1974, and this movie takes place now (as we see cell phones), then Heather should be 39 years old, and not a young woman as she is. Normally, things like this don't bug me, but it's just an obvious glitch that the writers don't seem to even care about. Then again, when do movies like this make sense? The movie certainly delivers in the gore and violence, so there is no points taken away there. The cast certainly seems game and they aren't bad. Alexandria Daddario is certainly one of the hottest and most alluring horror heroines I have seen in a long time. You can't take your eyes off of her. Her friends, however, are simply chainsaw fodder who make no real impression one way or another. They are introduced, dispatched, and that's that. Dan Yeager is certainly imposing as Leatherface, but I didn't really feel the character this time, or how it was turned in the end (which I will not go into if you haven't seen the movie). It was, however, a wonderful touch to have Chainsaw veterans (Gunnar Hansen, Marilyn Burns, John Duggan, and Bill Moseley) appear in cameos in the movie. There are also some other touches in homage to the original (Sheriff Hooper, pan up with girl walking in red shorts, the freezer, etc.) Sadly, these wonderful touches are only so few in the movie.

Perhaps the biggest flaw and disappointment about this movie is that it squandered the huge potential it had. It went back to the original series, which was already a huge plus. It incorporated footage from the original and picked up exactly where it left off in 1974. Perfect! It had the original cast members in cameos. Fantastic! It had an insanely hot lead girl. Great! But then, after the opening, it was never able to live up to what it started with, and that is the biggest shame of all. Now, don't get me wrong. It is watchable, hell, maybe even entertaining, but it ends with an empty feeling that it wasn't what you hoped it would be and most certainly not what it easily could have been.",1370131200,,3586,4.488514548238897

I love in the scene where she's looking thru the evidence and they blocked the date on the newspaper to try and cover the discrepancy.  And don't even get me started on all the dumb stuff they had the characters doing.  In one fail swoop they've managed to destroy the legacy of this franchise.  Just like the line where the cop shoots the victim and the sheriff yells, ""it's ok, it didn't happen, it didn't happen"", I wish the same for this film.  I mean, what was the point other than to try and capitalize on the franchise.  Trust me and save yourself the time, money and frustration.",1370044800,2,724,4.318518518518519

I was making fun of this movie for the last 45 minutes like MST 3000. This is 90 minutes of my life I can't get back and that's not cool.

4771211,4,B005LAIIAI,"In 1974 a film was released that became legendary. When it was made no one could foresee the future of this film or of its main character. But it not only became famous it became a cash cow for many films that followed as well as numerous marketing options. Surprisingly this horror film contained very little blood, but it was so well made that to this day it stands the test of time and can cause reactions from intense fear to gut wrenching nausea.  Believe it or not this was 39 years ago. So it's time once again for another sequel except this time it's done a tad different than most.

TEXAS CHAINSAW (or add 3-D if you have that at home) begins with the end of the original film. Not only that it encapsulates that film in a montage of clips that lead to a sheriff coming to the house shortly after the end of that film as well as several other clan members of the Sawyer family. He calls for them to come out but as they're about to a local vigilante mob shows with vengeance on their mind. Ignoring the sheriff they torch the house and kill all inside. The lone survivor, a baby girl, is taken away by one of the vigilantes to be raised as his own.

Fast forward to the present and we find the young baby all grown up. The young woman, Heather, receives a letter from an attorney and discovers who she really is and that she has an inheritance to collect from her recently deceased grandmother, Verna. Along with her boyfriend and another couple, who have planned a trip to New Orleans, they veer off towards Texas to see what she's inherited. Along the way they pick up a hitchhiker also on his way to Louisiana.

The lawyer meets her at the gates to her property and hands her a set of keys, a package and a letter from her grandmother with instructions to open and read it first. Of course these instructions are ignored when the youngsters enter the grand old house at the end of the drive. Impressed with the posh setting, they head to town to gather supplies leaving behind their new friend the hitchhiker. Bad choice.

He quickly begins ransacking the place for things to steal and uses the key to scout out the house. A secret room in the kitchen includes a stairway to a cellar. Once there he finds a locked door and as he gets ready to open it, there we have Leatherface in all his glory. And Leatherface doesn't take kindly to a thief.

Heather and friends return to find the slight damage done and begin to get down to making dinner. Her best friend then hits on her boyfriend in the barn while that girl's date starts dinner only to also discover Leatherface. When Heather comes across him in the cellar, she's caught but escapes with Leatherface on her tail. Suffice to say that blood runs and only Heather eventually gets away.

It is here the story makes a nice twist and we find out that the mayor is none other than the leader of the vigilante mob from all those years ago. He still runs things like he did then and sets out to end this semi-Hatfield and McCoy style feud between families once and for all.

This is one well made horror film. Not only does it pay tribute to the original by starting with it, it ignores all other remakes and sequels and also includes at least 4 cast members from the very first film in minor roles. Beyond that it takes what could have been just another slasher film and gives it some meat by crafting a well done story around it. With any film made these days, it leaves room open for a sequel but it does so in a way that makes sense.

The look of the film is great with night time shots done so that you can actually tell what you're looking at. The acting is much better than one would expect in a horror film, especially by Alexandria Daddario in the role of Heather. The pacing is smooth and the film makers here made the wise choice of keeping the film at a reasonable length (92 minutes) rather than extend what remains an exploitation film with a bigger budget.

The scares are there and, since it was done in 3-D, the tossed items at the camera are seen as well but not enough to distract from the story. The jumps scenes are included and yes, you will jump. The gore is there but no more than seen weekly on THE WALKING DEAD on TV. But at its heart this sequel to the original looks back fondly and reminds us that horror isn't always about what we see but what we picture and create in our minds. What we thought we saw is often more gruesome than what we actually witnessed. This movie makes the skin crawl and the hair on your arms rise. Isn't that what a good horror film should do?",1369958400,4,4558,4.29569266589057
4771212,5,B005LAIIAI,"I loved the Texas Chainsaw remake series they were very well done and I would love to see another sequel.  This film is a very well made sequel to the original classic and possibly the greatest horror film of all time The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Tobe Hooper.  The storyline in this film is great and fits perfectly with the original ending, leatherface looks awesome, the effects were second to none with some insane grizzly chainsaw action, the characters were well done and just annoying enough that you enjoy seeing them get whats comming to them, and the acting was well done.  Overall it was a great film and contained evenything I was excited and hoping for when I heard a new Texas Chiansaw film was comming.

4771323,3,B005LAIIAI,"I actually was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's a different take on the franchise with a more modern setting, a different type of villain and protagonist, a new take on Leatherface, different surroundings and for me, I loved it.

I was also surprised at how much personality was given to the main group of teenagers/young adults. This felt like the most active group out of all the movies and I loved what they brought to the film. Not only that all the supporting cast was great at adding levels of story and tenshion. Yes thesse characters do take the attention off Leatherface but seeing as Leatherface is supposed to have a slightly less prominant role in this movie it doesn't bother me. Deaths, twists, story and resolution all worked out pretty well, minus a couple of gripes.

Despite liking the movie there are problems with it. I'll be spoiling the opening scene. As with every Chainsaw movie after 2, this sequel has continuity issues in that Leatherfaces family has sudden had a complete personality change and has somehow increased to 11 and live in a more poplulated area. Also the time between the movies doesn't add up with what is on some tombstones and the development of the Iphone (I took that from other reviewers I'll admit). Leatherface does undergo a personality change but unlike the other sequels I feel there is a valid reason for this change.

Two final gripes are the death of a member of the main group was completly stupid, it felt like the producers couldn't think of a good way to kill the character so they went down this cheap route. It's during the Iphone scene. Finally the ending has a problem, Heather appears to have completly forgotten Leatherface killed 2 of her friends and almost killed her 3rd. Even if he's family and mentally handicapped I think you wouldn't just forgive him.

Still I really liked this moive and look forward to picking it up.",1369872000,,1907,4.683582089552239

It sort of ruined the entire movie for me.

He killed all her friends, but suddenly decided Leatherface was ""family"" so it made it all okay.  Also, what about the police man who was waiting outside smoking?  We just didn't see him after his Dad was killed inside?

Lastly, I don't recall all those people in the house after the original character back in 1973 jumped through the window to escape the house of horrors.  Where did they all come from?  The lady with the baby? Odd....

4771332,2,B005LAIIAI,"Well, here we go again into Texas, in a van, with a bunch of teens. Originally inspired by Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, Texas Chainsaw Massacre hit the silver screen in 1974 and was a smash hit at a time when people craved intense horror movies because they were relatively new. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" opened up Pandora's box and then everybody began to do crazy things with film, trying to push the envelope even further. ""Chainsaw"" was a major push. Today's audience may not be the same as it was in 1974, but apparently there is still a popularity to speak of.

""Chainsaw Massacre"" is not your average horror movie franchise. Many highly familiar actors have gone up against or protected Leather-face. People like Viggo Mortenson (Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III 1990, Lord of the Rings trilogy), Dennis Hopper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II 1986), Matthew McConaughey (Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation 1994), Renee Zellweger (Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation 1994, Jerry Maguire), Jessica Biel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003, Total Recall) and Jordana Brewster (Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning 2006, Fast and the Furious). So, I guess, as far as horror movies go, ""Texas Chainsaw"" is sort of a classic.

The actors in this new version, ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" aren't all that well known, but neither were Zellweger, Mortenson and McConaughey. Alexandra Daddario gets the main role this go around. Her most well known movie to date would be, hands down, ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief"". She does a great job in this. She has to do more than scream in terror and run and look scared. Her character is a little bit more complicated, and that's a really good thing with a genre and a series that are pretty much consistent of bringing teens to the slaughter and then rolling credits.

""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" was a mixed bag for me. Fully expecting to be treated to the same ol' same ol' horror movie, I was at least glad that they had a story to tell that was different than the rest; not much different, but different. The filming is intense and I have to admit there were numerous times that I felt my heart leap and I was feeling the intended fear they shoot for. On the bad side, the movie in its effort to be different than the others had a few hard to believe moments that I shouldn't get into, but I'll do it carefully. A baby is left with a mark from a family crest necklace early in the movie and then years later when they are an adult, the mark is exactly the same.

The biggest problem I had with the movie though was the story arch that turned Leather-face into a sympathetic character that you were conflicted about rooting for. I guess all horror movies sort of do that, but this one goes even further and I found some decisions made by certain characters to be highly questionable. Many of these questionable decisions were things that were poorly set up and poorly thought out.

As far as horror movies go though, I guess it's a pretty good scare and a pretty intense trip to the movies. If you like common sense and decency in your characters, skip it. Finally, the 3D was sort of gimmicky. It works pretty good for the most part, but there were times that it didn't.",1369699200,2,3235,4.678383128295255

4771435,4,B005LAIIAI,"Texas Chainsaw 3D is by far the best sequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it definitely outdoes the remake and prequel.

This movie was pretty well thought out. I really like how they incorporated the original into the opening credits and they start the movie right where the original left off.

On a side note I extremely enjoyed the cameos, especially Gunnar Hansen, major props for that, also the detail the designers put into the house was unreal.

The action starts right away after the opening credits with a big ass shootout between the Sawyers and some po'ed townspeople. Our main character of the movie is the only Sawyer to make it out alive, besides for leatherface of course, due to the fact that she is a infant and is taken from her mother by one of the members of the lynch mob whose wife can't have children. She is brought up not knowing about her true identity, but that all changes when her Grandmother passes away and leaves her a house and all her assets, which includes Leatherface! After confronting her parents about her true identity, her, her boyfriend, her friend, and her friends boyfriend all pack up in a van and take a road trip to Texas to check out the house. Its not long after the reach the house when we get our first look at Leatherface. Dan Yeager does a incredible job as Leatherface. He is a beast and even added a bit of a drag to his right leg, where if you remember Leatherface was hurt in the original movie. It is simple little details like that, that can really help drive a performance.

As for the 3D, it was pretty well executed. There are a few out of screen effects, with the most effective being the chainsaw through the casket lid, and the depth was pretty good throughout. The 3D won't blow you away, but it does really add to the feel and atmosphere of the movie.

Overall I say at the very least rent this one and if you have the opportunity to check it out in 3D then go for. Don't let all the bad reviews keep you from checking this one out, they are just hardcore fans of the original who don't want it to be messed with, but I promise they did a hell of a job on this flick, while showing alot of respect to the original.",1369526400,2,2187,4.337408312958435

I knew it was made as a direct sequel to the original, and liked how there were scenes from the original woven through the opening credits. The actor who played the original Leatherface, Gunner Hansen, was in the house at the beginning of the movie as one of the Sawyer family members. What followed afterwards was an entertaining movie that had the scares, decent acting,and a surprisingly good story. Definitely not for the squeamish, which I would think people know when you have someone wielding a chainsaw as their weapon of choice.",1369526400,2,625,4.796296296296297

4771439,3,B005LAIIAI,"As a big fan of horror films, the remaking and re-imaging of classic and iconic horror franchises is something I've had to get used to, whether I like it or not. Overall, I hate the idea of an attempt to remake or re-image horror films (or films in general) for the simple reason is that these films don't need to be reworked! These films are classics for a reason, and even with certain flaws, there are masterpieces of horror film making in their own right. But I do have to admit, there was a higher level of excitement with the anticipation of this film than I had before with the previous two films in the series. I had kept up with the film's development since the very early stages. I had heard about how this film was going to have a lot of cameos by original TCM cast members, how it was actually going to be a direct sequel to the original; even picking up exactly where the original film left off. After seeing production shots of the ""Sawyer"" house and landscape, and reading about how it was so closely reproduced to look exactly like the original film, I really began to have optimism that Hollywood just might not screw this one up. However, as more details regarding the plot were released and promotion of the film increased, I realized that I had definitely jumped the gun on this one.  This review may get lengthy and it may seem like I'm really picking this film apart and over analyzing just another run-of-the-mill horror film, but I feel a remake or sequel to any great film, especially my all-time favorite horror film, should be subject to that kind of scrutiny on my behalf.  For me, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the Citizen Kane of the horror genre. And there's nowhere to go but down when compared to the original.

To begin with, the very beginning/credit sequence of the film is great. Mainly because it's the summary of the original film, using the actual footage. And its edited quite nicely I might add.  And yes, technically this film does begin where the original left off. Presumably minutes after, at the Sawyer farm. (It should be mentioned that was no family name was used in the original and that the ""Sawyer"" name did not materialize until the 1986 sequel.) The exterior and interiors of the house are almost identical to the original, right down to the truck parked outside. Unfortunately for me and a lot of true fans of the original TCM, you get to see VERY little of it. For all the time and effort the production put in to recreated the exact location, the scene is over with in maybe 5 minutes. It's great seeing Bill Moseley as the cook, Drayton Sawyer, but he's dead within a few minutes. The same goes for Grandpa, a role that John Dugan reprised from the original. But if you blink, you'll miss him. He barely gets on screen. And then we have all the ""extra"" Sawyers, I presume. And this is where I begin shaking my head. Why? Why have all these other characters? It is completely unnecessary. Sure, it's cool to see Gunnar Hansen, the original Leatherface, on screen as one of these guys. But to me, those characters are pointless. Why would you try so hard to tie it to the original film and then add all these characters that never existed before? I understand that to be able to develop the story, a female infant has to be there and has to survive. That's the plot and I get that. But there are other ways to do that without having to introduce all these other people that just die a minute into the film anyway.

I think my biggest gripe with the film is the timeline itself. It's one thing to be disappointed when you realize that most of the characters you were excited to see on screen, die in the opening scene, but then the film jumps forward to modern day. And that's where this movie blows it. It completely screws the timeline up. The film in many ways, is quite vague on what years these events are supposed to occur, sometimes it seems to go out of the way to do so. For example, it doesn't show the dates on tombstones and doesn't show the complete date in newspaper headlines. And none of the friends are shown using a cell phone. Yet certain vehicles are clearly modern. And just when you think that perhaps that the film is trying to be passed off as being set at least a few years earlier than today, a cop whips a smartphone and starts using an app (Facetime) that has only been in existence for a couple of years! And the aggravating thing about it is that it wasn't necessary!!! The scene would have worked just as good, if not better, without the inclusion of the device, and at least it would have given the movie a benefit of a doubt as far as the timeline goes. But with this being shown, the movie's story cannot occur not earlier than 2010. So if events of the opening scene happened in August 1973, the main protagonist would have to be around 35 or 36 years old!! And Leatherface would have to be at least in his 50s! And here's where a lot of you are saying ""It's just a movie!!"" well yeah, it is. But again, when you make the effort to make a DIRECT sequel and go to the lengths of including original footage, how can you not make the effort for a storyline to add up? Did the writers not think that true fans weren't going to notice this? Gimme a break! And there's definitely other little things, though less important, that I didn't particularly care for. Plot points that go unresolved (the boyfriend cheating on the main protagonist), Leatherface throwing a chainsaw at a cop and running off into the woods and the cop doesn't even bother pursuing him, and characters screaming lame one liners like ""Welcome to Texas Mother****er!"" and ""Do your thing, Cuz!"".  Now as far as the idea of making Leatherface an ""anti-hero"" by the end of the film, I kind of have mixed feelings about it. I'm not really crazy about the idea, but it doesn't particularly bother me either. Actually I feel that the Leatherface has always been a bit of a sympathetic character anyway. Only this film clearly pushes this idea to the foreground.

Ok, so I've bashed the film enough, on to a few things I liked. First off, the performance of Dan Yeager as Leatherface.  I'm willing to go as far as saying he might be the best Leatherface since Gunnar Hansen. For once, some overly huge, muscle-bound guy wasn't cast. Sure, Yeager is a big guy, but not a some physically fit football player type. He's just a big guy. And his portrayal of Leatherface; his look, his stature, his movements, are all done really well. He easily has the best performance of the entire film. With that said, I was very pleased with the blood, gore, and the kill scenes in the film. The special effects were very good. Another thing that I did enjoy was the many homages and references to the original film. Of course, the cameos were great, but there were some more subtle things here and there that you couldn't help to like. I do appreciate the fact that the filmmakers did embrace and respect the original film so much and didn't attempt to completely go off track and make up some ridiculous story. Though the main plot isn't the best, its plausible (minus the timeline flaw ) and it at least keeps you interested for the most part.

As far as the DVD itself goes, there's a decent amount of special features which are pretty good, including audio commentaries by Tobe Hooper and some original TCM cast members, several""making-of"" featurettes,  and on set interviews with cast members.

Now this isn't a bad horror film in general. It's not even the worst in the TCM series. But with the ideas, actors, and storylines that they had at their disposal, the filmmakers basically still chose to make this just another horror movie without anything too special about it. They could have made this movie into something different and at least attempted to give it a certain realism that the original film had. The characters from the original film should have had much more screen time and the film should have followed a much more direct timeline and not have been set in modern day.  Overall, it's a fairly enjoyable film to watch, especially if you're only the casual horror fan. But any true horror fan knows that of course, it doesn't even come close to matching up with the original film and its simply just a slightly before average sequel in the series. And quite honestly, that's disappointing. I feel that this could have had potential to be the best since the original film. And unfortunately, I fear that any further sequels based of this storyline, aren't even going to be as good as this one.",1369440000,10,8546,4.510006455777921

4771503,1,B005LAIIAI,"Do not waste your time. the 92 minutes this film runs is 92 minutes you will want back. everything is beyond predictable. I would say it has 1 dimensional characters but that would mean it has characters. their are only 2 kinds of people in this film, guy who gets killed and girl who gets killed. If you think what about gunner hanson bill mosley and yaphet koto. Well guess what. They are barely in this movie. Gunner  has 0 line, all he dose is sit in a chair for about 5 seconds. Bill mosley is in it for 2 minutes and dose nothing. Yaphet kotto dose again more nothing.

The effects are embarasing. At some parts they use CGI blood and limbs. which look terrible.
Letherface's mask looks nothing like a human face until he makes a new one about 2/3 through the movie. He cuts off a guys face and the skin instantly turns to well tanned leather.

The people are all unlikable and dumb as rocks. Seriously the main girl lets a hitchiker they just met stay behind in her house while they leave for steaks. Then she is shocked to find her house robbed. as Carlos mencia would say. she is a dee dee dee.

their is a pointless subplot were the token black guy cheats on his girlfreind and that subplot gose.....  Nowere.

this film then grabs any excuse to have a muscular guy take off his shirt. is this a horror film or a chip n dales video?

even a dimwitted person wil see everything comming a mile away. The gags are very obviouse. you know everything before it happens. I could tell they put 0 thought into this travesty.

worst of all nobody gets killed with the chainsaw. I paid too see somone sawed and instead we get leatherface using a hammer an axe and a hook.

Overall I would give this film 0 out of 5 but amazon makes you give it atleast 1. You can put this film up their with the Phantom menace, Prometheus, and kingdom of the crystal skull. As it is easily one of the worst reboots ever. I hate to say it but even Batman and Robin was a mastepeice compared to this. Please I emplore you do not buy this.

Well newsflash, this is what, the 7th or 8th Chainsaw movie?  I am pretty certain the director and writers didn't make this movie to win any awards.  This is simpy a fresh take on an old classic that has been redone how many times?  And honestly, this is the first movie that had a whole new twist to it, rather than just remaking the exact same story over and over and over.  We go to the movies to be entertained and this delivered.  Horror fans don't go to horror movies to see stellar acting, perfect story lines and serious characters.  We don't want to see Brad Pitt and George Clooney running for their lives.  We want no names playing unsuspecting young adults whom we don't care about get chopped up to bits.  And like i said, this was a fresh take on the series and was fairly original.  Although we all love what Leatherface does in previous films, this is the first time where we actually see him and his family as the victims and we root for him.  In my mind, they did a great job turning the table and creating humanity out of a crazed psycho killer.  So take it for what it is, entertaining.

Don't get me wrong, this is no masterpiece. The 2003 remake and almost all of the other sequels were better films overall. I just think this is a very fun late nite horror flick.

A mob of people come to the Sawyer house, burning it down to the ground. Leatherface and a baby escape the inferno. The baby is found by Gavin and Arlene, naming her Heather.

39 years later (although Heather looks to be in her 20's) Heather is called back to Texas because her grandma has passed away and left her a mansion. When she arrives with her friends, Leatherface breaks loose and has a rip-roaring good time with his trusty chainsaw. From chasing them to a Halloween carnival and followed by an epic chainsaw fight conclusion at the original slaughterhouse, this is definitely one of the better films in this series.

The 3D is real good. There can be no doubt it is real 3D. Family is everything in this wacky, gruesome, body parts  thriller.

What to expect. Heads severed at the shoulders. Bodies cut cleanly in two. Suspense. Villains in the shredder. Granny exhumed from her coffin because she was missed a lot. Girl runs away from the maniac, falling all the time and survives each encounter, never breaking her ankle. May god be praised.

It has the best 3D cover ever.

Inter racial romance works in this flick. It is something I am not to crazy about.

4771580,1,B005LAIIAI,"I'll preface this diatribe by stating I am a long time horror fan & obviously a fan of the original.  I always go into these remakes/sequels with the infintesimally tiniest glimmer of hope that the director, at the very least, makes it in such a way that, how should I put this...doesn't totally suck.  That's all I ask.  Not much right?  I'd even take ""mediocre"".  As per the usual 99% of remakes/sequels...it does indeed bite the big one.  How hard can it be to make something even mediocre?!?!  Hard to fathom right?

I'll make my points & let you decide for yourself...(please note any ""spoilers"" (if there could even be in such a wreck) will not in any way ruin your ""enjoyment"" of this masterpiece)

1 - Poor Gunnar Hansen (the original Leatherface) can't act...even in his handful of lines as a Sawyer family member in the opening...he's pitiful.  Sorry Gunnar...luv ya brutha.  Maybe grab the mask again for the next one.

2 - Bill Mosely (from Texas 2) does a poor job trying to recreate Jim Siedow's original character from the original.  Met Bill at a couple conventions...super cool dude...but can't you even try to recreate Siedow's memorable southern drawl?  Here he's all tense & upset...nothing like the true nutjob that this character was originally.

3 - As per usual in these hackjobs...many shoddy CGI bloodshot squibs.  Hey guys, WE CAN TELL!  Doesn't look real.  But of course doing it old school with real squibs is expensive instead of just getting some pimply faced kid to post it with a lame looking CGI squib on his laptop.  See: Gunnar's death blow from a bullet...the blood stain moves around with the action of the camera & doesn't stay put...cheap.  Witness: A real bad pitchfork kill near the end where again, the bloodstain haphazardly moves around.  Cry at: The final knucklehead's meat grind...poor sheite as well.

4 - A true waste of the original actor John Dugan's grandpa character...they go to the trouble of getting the freakin' original actor to recreate his unforgettable character from almost 40 years ago!...then you barely see him in the background for like 3 seconds as he gets wasted.  An unfortunate faux pas.  Massively dropped the ball on that front.

5 - The ""getting to know you"" scene in the meat market with the 2 lead actresses....Is it just me or is that the worst set of acting chops you've seen in a great while?  It's either real bad acting OR a poor lipsync job in redubbing?  Either way...laughable.

6 - Why, oh why, do these modern horror remakes/sequels ALWAYS have to put some cheap ass rapper/hip hopper/R&B dude or cliche'd african american in EVERY horror flick?  Is that their way of ""hipping"" up the proceedings?  Hey, the kids like these types now a days...lets throw some cat in there to ""up the coolness factor"".  Sorry, steals from the vibe man.  Maybe try this...throw in a REAL african american ACTOR who...well, CAN ACT!  Trey Songz...for real?  Then even more of a party foul...he doesn't even get killed in a decent manner thus robbing the viewer of that simple & well deserved pleasure.  See: Busta Rhymes or LL Cool J in the Halloween sequels or ICE-T in ""Leprechaun: In The Hood"".  Who can forget Rhymes trying to act tough in the equally horrible ""Halloween: Resurrection""...""YO! MICHAEL!!!""...then he gets his ass clapped.  Real weak.

7 - Let's get to the music...I'm sorry...rap music in a Texas Chainsaw film?...sorry doesn't cut it.  The sick southern redneck vibe doesn't ring true when you have a couple fool-assed punks trying to be hip in the back of a van driving to hell whilst listening to rap.  No place for it in a Texas Chain.

8 - How bout some REAL bad fright wigs...the adoptive mother or the black sherrif's hat hidden afro in the flashback.

9 - Some shady post dub work...See: Trey Songz deliver ""Baby I'm Sorry"" in an over the shoulder shot to his gal.  Doesn't sound like it was recorded in the same room for dumps sake let alone the fact that his mouth doesn't even open upon delivery.  See: Trey Songz again...deliver the line ""What the hell Nicky?"" when the cheap broad seduces him.  These lines are nowhere even in the ball park as far as matching audio.

10 - The actresses...along with the aforementioned poor acting skills...why does Hollywood always need to throw in these actresses for looks?  Can't the lead be quirky looking or chunky or goofy for a change?  I can see if they plan on adding gratuitous boob shots but you don't even get that in this movie so why bother?  The Nicky character is all about her rear-end & the Heather character is all about her belly shirt.  The director rides these 2 ""assets"" for all they are worth in shot after shot.  They look nice of course but it's distracting when they always look like they were primped for about 2 hours before every scene.  Heather's hair, eye make-up & clothing seem WAY too overthought to look cool & perfect.  It's a horror flick for cryin' out loud.  Hell even when Heather is supposed to be busted up & bloody...she STILL looks like a they glam'd her up for an hour & then put a couple blood streaks on her face.  Ridiculous.

11 - Heather's shirts...these should get special mention in the credits & residuals since the open belly look continues it's appearance no matter the circumstance.  I had to scratch my head in disbelief when, upon being given a ""new"" shirt (after she's been through hell & back & all mucked up)...with full button down capability...she STILL only buttons the couple across her breasts so that upon every movement, the full creamy white belly is still on full display, shining through at it's grandest!  It's utterly ridiculous.  You've just been through hell, get a new shirt...""oh, I'll just button 2 buttons so I still look bellylicious"".  And, hey John Luessenhop (hack director)
...don't even try to pawn off the idea that you needed the shirt partway exposed so it would become a plot point with that cheap burn mark...ain't buying it.  Any reasonable human being would BUTTON THEM ALL after being put through the ringer.  Stupidity.

12 - The carnival scene...do I even need to get into the moronacy of having Heather jump up & grab onto a ferris wheel seat to ""escape"" Leatherface?  Hmmm, this thing goes round & round...let me hang precariously from a seat railing so...A) I either fall off...or...B) I just hang on till I make the full circle & come down 5 feet from where I started to ""make my escape"".  What in the hell?

13 - The ""letter"" plot point...who was the brain truss that wrote in this bit of business?  Let's see...the lawyer gives Heather an important letter EXPLAINING THE WHOLE DEAL TO HER IN BLACK & WHITE...then proceeds to tell her ""Read the letter!!!!"" stressing it's importance.  Then she doesn't bother to read it till after all hell's broken loose at the end of the film.  Come on...tell me straight...was this a 7th grader who wrote this thing? No offense to 7th graders of course.

14 - The ""face time"" schtick...man, oh man is this a bumbler.  An entire scene is pathetic'd up when a redneck deputy proceeds to transmit his whole walkthrough of the death house to the redneck mayor & the sherrif so they can STAND THERE AT THE STATION HOUSE & WATCH THE CARNAGE ON A PHONE...INSTEAD OF GETTING THEIR ASSES OUT THERE whilst this chump looks for Leatherface BY HIMSELF amidst the carnage.  Yeah that's the first thing I'd do while looking for an insane chainsaw killer...try to face time the thing instead of concentrate on not getting my dome kicked in & sawed to hell.  Still scratching my head.

15 - Leatherface's new skin mask...is it just me? or did he have time to finely condition his ""fresh from the carcass"" skin mask into a thick leathery perfect version of a catcher's mitt?

16 - The bonding moment...when Leatherface & his cousin have their sweet bonding moment...she utters one of the finest bits of dialog since Citizen Kane...""Do your thing cuz"".  Then he chows some dude to shreds.

17 - The ""humanizing"" of Leatherface...somehow you are supposed to feel sorry for the wrongs done to Leatherface & his family.  Didn't anybody see the first film?  Granted the rednecks in town are are painted as some sort of monsters as well...but then to try to humanize Leatherface?  What the hell?  The utter fear in the original is that you don't know who or why these nutjobs are churning people into BBQ.  Trying to put a backstory on pure evil is assinine & takes away from the horror of it all.  They are scary because you don't know why they are hacking people into chow.  Now I know Leatherface's whole family intimately & how they were ""wronged"".  Maybe it was a 6th grader put the wheels in motion on this epic?

On the plus side, I did like the turned over dead armadillo shot.  That was a nice tribute to the past.

Of course every horror fan will give this schlock a shot.  How can you not?  It's got the Texas Chain pedigree right?  Well, it has ""Texas Chainsaw"" in the title, I'll give it that.  I thought Platinum Dunes did a massive dis-service to the ""franchise"".  These new mookes are even worse.  Can't wait for the next one!

4771684,4,B005LAIIAI,"We all know the story.  One August afternoon, five friends went for a drive before running out of gas near an isolated farmhouse.  Over the next twelve hours, four of them were killed by the inhabitants living inside, including one hulking monstrosity we know as Leatherface with a penchant for power tools.  By morning only one girl was left, screaming and covered in more blood than Carrie at her prom.  Texas Chainsaw picks up immediately after she makes it back to the local authorities.  Here, a vengeful mob attacks the homestead, killing almost everyone inside except for one baby and, unbeknownst to the mob, Leatherface.

Fast forward thirty years later and we find Heather living an absolute nightmare of a life with parents who openly despise her.  All of this changes when she gets a letter from a lawyer telling her that a grandmother she never knew has died and has left her the family home.  Together with her friends, Heather makes her way to Texas and this is where the true horror really begins.

Interesting enough, this wasn't as bad as people are making it out to be.  While coming off the heels of both the remake and prequel, it's easy to see why so many people hate it.  It's definitely lower budget and you won't find any real recognizable faces (some may know Trey Songz but I don't know who he is).  I also notice that this is sort of two stories in one.  The first half is your basic, by the numbers slasher flick but once Heather becomes the aware of who she is and what her connection to Leatherface is, then a deeper, more intense second half becomes a revenge flick.  The kills are pretty good and the acting isn't too bad.  All in all, despite the numerous plot holes (including an obvious age gap.  Logically speaking, Heather should have been in her 40s but here she's about 21.), it's not too shabby of a movie and it will certainly keep you interested through it.

4771685,4,B005LAIIAI,"It's 1974, angry townsfolk hunt down & kill every member of the Sawyer family for their series of grisly murders. Decades later, hundreds of miles away, a young woman learns that she's inherited a Texas estate from a grandmother she never knew she had. Taking a road trip with her friends to uncover her roots there, she soon finds out she is the sole owner of a lavish, isolated Victorian mansion. But that comes at a price as she stumbles upon a horror that awaits her & her friends in the mansion's dank cellars.

I don't know where the Director was trying to head with this film. It's being promoted as a true sequel to the original film.  One thing, I do know, is that Texas Chainsaw basically ignores every other film that's been made(other than the original) to tell this tale. Even then, it's kinda hard to follow since it doesn't really follow the backstory from the first film to the letter. See, Texas Chainsaw begins on the day that the first film ends. The Sawyer family is confronted by the local townsfolk for what they did and only three(of the Sawyer family) survive that tragedy(Leatherface, Verna Sawyer, and a baby). The baby is taken from the scene and grows up with anadopted family.  Until, as an adult, she is told that she's just inherited a home from family she never knew she had...which is where our tale begins. What's tricky is..the original tale begins in 1973. Heather, the young inheriter, is in her early 20s I'm supposing which would make the story take place sometime in the 1990s. Cellphones like the Iphone or Smartphone weren't available back then. If this is supposed to be set in modern day times, I'm sure Heather would be an old woman by this time or fastly approaching. Not only that but I thought the original TCM family was a small group(5 or 6 at most). In this movie, there seems to be a whole clan of them.

Despite all its'inaccuracies and flaws, Texas Chainsaw does succeed at one thing. That is, it being a good old-school horror movie. For that, I give Texas Chainsaw 4 stars. However, if I were to get more technical(picky) about things, as far as it being a good TCM movie--it would probably receive less.  It's not a good TCM movie. I mean, this movie tries to 'humanize' Leatherface..for chrissakes!

Even so, Texas Chainsaw ain't quite that bad. I liked it myself. It's a heck of a sight better than some of the other <ahem> crap that I've seen out there. It's good for a rental..but, if you're wanting to purchase it to add to your TCM collection, I'd do some serious thinking about it first.",1368662400,2,2551,4.558951965065503
4771686,3,B005LAIIAI,"*Spoilers*

Much has been made of the glaring continuity error involving this film's timeline of events and its relation to the original TCM, so I won't rehash that here.  But even if that particularly lazy bit of screenwriting had been cleaned up prior to filming, there are still far too many ludicrous plot turns to make 2013's ""Texas Chainsaw"" the effective franchise reboot everyone involved was hoping for.

The biggest drawback here is the writers' absurd notion of attempting to shift the audience's sympathy to Leatherface and the other members of the Sawyer clan.  Making ignorant, vengeful townsfolk more deplorable than the actual movie monster is all well and good; it's a tactic that works well in some horror movies, but a TCM movie just isn't the place for it.  And while I applaud the attempt to put a fresh twist into an entry in a franchise as stale and formulaic as TCM, Leatherface's last-quarter shift into an avenging anti-hero was...laughable.  The idea was obviously to put a fresh coat of paint on a tired slasher icon, and possibly offer a throwback to the era of the sympathetic monster (Frankenstein's monster comes to mind), and it almost works...but not quite.

Still, I do appreciate the intention to give audiences a little more than ""same old, same old"", and while the left-field plotting misses the mark, I did enjoy the audacity of it.  Without it, TCM '13 would be just another plain-vanilla slasher that any semi-competent screenwriter could type with his elbows.

So, to sum it up, this is a movie that takes way too many wacky liberties with established TCM lore to do anything other than irritate and annoy hardcore fans.  But for casual fans and those new to the franchise, TCM '13 might be just different enough to score a few points if you're willing to check logic at the door.

At any rate, it's at least somewhat more enjoyable than the relentlessly dour, grimy, and dingy 2003 remake and its 2006 sequel.

4771689,1,B005LAIIAI,"I usually stay away from writing movie reviews here but with all the inexplicably good reviews, I had to chime in. This might have been an entertaining movie for two groups: people under 15 years old, and those who have no knowledge of the original, or simply don't care about it. Otherwise, this was just an abomination. First of all, we are led to believe that there was a whole Sawyer family somehow hiding in the house during the first movie - WITH A BABY! What a cheap excuse to continue the series and characters! Then comes the ""original"" mask worn by Leatherface, which was just laughable. Really - in all these years, they couldn't make the mask as scary and unnerving as it was in 1974?? Then comes the typically idiot, unlikeable characters - just waiting to be Leatherface fodder. We are then supposed to believe that Leatherface has been living in the basement of this beautiful mansion - locked away for how long since his elderly aunt died? He sure was pretty hefty for probably not being fed for the last month or three. Did I mention the unlikeable, lunkheaded main cast?? Did anybody who is reviewing this here with 5-star reviews not cringe when Leatherface's ""cousin"" actually blurts out ""do your thing, cuz!""??? Really, this had none of the original movie's sense of hyper-reality and dread, nor was it scary and visceral like the 2003 remake. No, this was as bad as I'd hoped it wouldn't be. A tired, listless film with no scares - for people who obviously can't discern between what makes a film work and what doesn't.",1368576000,7,1541,4.648351648351649
4771690,4,B005LAIIAI,"Imagine, if you will, a world where ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,"" ""Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III,"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" never happened. We won't even mention the remake and its sequel since they're not part of the original canon. The slate of what many consider inadequate follow-ups to the original is wiped completely clean. This scenario is exactly what ""Texas Chainsaw"" asks of its audience.

Picking up immediately after the original 1974 film ended, ""Texas Chainsaw"" takes audiences back to the Sawyer homestead. Shortly after the police show up to arrest Leatherface (Dan Yeager), an unruly mob decides to take the law into their own hands. They burn down and kill all the family holed up in the house, with the exception of Leatherface and a woman protecting a baby. One of the townspeople kills the woman and takes the baby to raise on their own.

Years later, the girl, Heather (Alexandra Daddario), discovers she was adopted and is a member of the Sawyers. Her grandmother (Marilyn Burns), who she never knew, dies and leaves her Texas home to the girl. Heather and her friends decide to take a road trip to see what she has inherited. They soon find out she's been left with a lot more than just an old house. She's also responsible for keeping the Sawyer family's secret locked safely away in the basement.

Director John Lussenhop does a great job in his first foray into the horror genre. He attempts to bring a fresh approach to ""Texas Chainsaw"" and not rest on the laurels laid out by past entries in the franchise. He picks little bits and pieces from the original 1974 film and inserts them in certain scenes to pay tribute to it and give fans of the original some easter eggs to hunt.

The Sawyer homestead was rebuilt from scratch based on screen captures and a visit to the original house, which is now a restaurant. Every detail of the house inside and out has painstakingly been reconstructed. It's eerie and gives the beginning of the movie an authentic flavor.

My only minor complaints about ""Texas Chainsaw"" is the lack of the family dynamics seen in the first film. This movie focuses on Leatherface only. The absence of a psychotic ensemble of characters and the dark humor of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" are sadly missing. Those are both elements I believe drew audiences to the first two movies and set them apart from other slasher films.

""Texas Chainsaw"" alumni play the different members of the Sawyer family. Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface in the original film), Bill Moseley (""Chop-Top"" Sawyer in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2""), and Marilyn Burns all play members of the Sawyer clan. John Dugan returns to play Grandpa again as well.

Alexandra Daddario shows a different side of herself in ""Texas Chainsaw"" than we saw in ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief."" She gets down and dirty and commands every scene she's in. Leatherface might have finally found a worthy guardian to keep him in line.

The DVD version of ""Texas Chainsaw"" contains multiple commentaries featuring Director John Luessenhop, Actor Dan Yeager, Producer Carl Mazzocone, Filmmaker Tobe Hooper, Bill Moseley, Gunnar Hansen, Marilyn Burns, and John Dugan. Seven featurettes are included entitled ""'Texas Chainsaw' Legacy,"" ""Resurrecting the Saw,"" ""The Old Homestead,"" ""Casting Terror,"" ""Leatherface 2013,"" ""Lights, Camera, Massacre,"" and ""It's In the Meat."" On Set Short Subjects called ""Five Minute Massacres"" explore the making of the film. An alternate opening is featured as well.

I really had no major complaints about ""Texas Chainsaw."" I found it to be an entertaining and engaging start for a whole new series of films they're planning to release. It was graphic and gory like we've come to expect, but still had a sense of suspense to keep a viewer's attention.",1368576000,4,3846,4.968895800933126
4771701,3,B005LAIIAI,"This movie really surpised me as I went into it expecting it to be oh-so terrible. So terrible in fact, I stopped the Hubs from running out and buying it, and insisted we rent instead. I never hold out much hope for new horror movies. Just hope to stumble across some good oldies. However, this one proved to be better than most modern horror films.

The Hubs and I are big fans of the Texas Chainsaw franchise. Going back to the original, the sequals, the prequals, the remakes, you name it. (Although, I personally do not care for the ""Next Generation"" movie. I would have to be pretty drunk to agree to sit through that snoozer again. And Renee Zellwigger ain't helpin'!)

Anyway, this latest installment is an interesting take on the franchise, and is kind of fun.
It opens with clips of all the classic scenes and kills of the original Texas Chainsaw movie, and then picks up right where it left off. We see what happened to the Sawyer clan after the slack-jawed locals get their hands on them. A little Texas justice, if you will.
(Along with the opening clips, you will find other little touches of nostalgia all through-out the film, which is fun for fans. Like the down low camera work (picture tight red shorts a la the original.))

From there we follow a young lady, who was recently revealed to be kin to the Sawyers, as she travels back to what used to be her home town. There she finds her roots as she begins to dig into her family's past.

As is typical, she has a van load of friends, ripe for the killing.

Having said that though, the other movies were very ""kill driven"" whereas this movie is more story driven. And it is a pretty good little story. Even with the little holes here and there, but it's a horror movie. We can get over it.

And of course there are those moments where you roll your eyes, or yell at the the movie. Like, ""Yeah, you only had time to do ONE button on that shirt, there, girly?"" (Eye roll) Or, ""How about you call in for some mother lovin' back-up for this guy?!"" (Yell at the movie)

And, sure, some of the kills were predictable, but come on....this isn't our first rodeo.

I found the feel of the movie to be much more open, and airy, which I actually liked. Gone were the dank, dripping basements, the dusty, dark interiored farm houses, the tight enclosed spaces. It was much less ""stifling"" in my opinion. Not that I have a problem with that, but it was just a nice change.

I was excited to see that Nicataro and Berger were on board for the effects, so I was hoping for some old-school effects and gore, which they did deliver. However, this gal does NOT go for digital blood or effects. (Or digital fire. Honestly, digital fire? You can't give us real flames?!) I much prefer effects that were created by man's own hand. Like in the days of yore, back when Savini and Nicataro were teamed up, or even when K.N.B were still rockin' it together old school. But in this day and age, this is hard to come by as digital is much more cost, and time, effective. So, to my disappointment, there were several scenes that included digital effects. (Boooooo!) A few of which were REALLY bad. (Even bigger BOOOOOOO!) In fact, there is an effect at the end that nearly ruined the entire movie for us, it was so unforgivable. That particular kill should have been totally re-thought and those effects completely avoided. It left a bad taste in our mouths. They could easily have done a different, more interesting kill, with better effects. It would have been so worth the re-work. Trust me, you'll know it when you see it.

Overall, this movie wasn't as gorey as I like to see them, but it had some honest-to-goodness gross-out moments.

Also, I thought the new Leather Face was actually pretty good! He had more personality.

I wanted to mention that there also was this odd effect that was added to the film where the corners of the screen are filled with this red haze during a lot of the movie. It didn't bother me much, but I didn't really get the purpose of it either. The Hubs however found it really annoying. He was definitely not a fan of the weird red haze.

We do plan on purchasing this movie, but are still glad we rented it first. Now we know it's probably not worth top dollar, so we will instead buy used, or wait for the price to go down significantly.

I would say that this movie is definitely worth a watch.",1368576000,2,4372,4.408188585607941
4771702,3,B005LAIIAI,"To start off i am a huge fan of cheesy horror movies and i have a real big love for 3d horror flicks. So you can imagine how excited i was about this movie. A new era of a great slasher series and in 3D!!! How could this go wrong?!! Well it does..

The story itself started off good and i liked the new direction they took off to in the beginning. Pretty much imagine that only the original TCM and this movie is it's one and only sequel. The sole living girl from the original escapes and goes to the cops right afterwards..okay that makes sense. Cop comes out to bring in killer but is disrupted by a texas lynch mob who comes in and kills all the family for being butchers. For Texas still makes sense. Only the baby was left alive and was adopted to one of the members of the lynch mob due to not being able to have a baby. okay i get it. Then baby grows up and is left a home in texas from babies former grandmother. brings friends out with her and all get killed by the killer. Then girl relizes killer is her cousin and forgives him for killing all her friends and goes on to help killer kill the the evil lynch mob for killing there family who were killing innocent kids and they actually make you try to feel sorry for them. Oh did i forget to mention that the sherriff watched the girl and the killer kill several people and did nothing but watch on and told them to clean up the mess and he was suppose to be a good cop...WHAT?!!!!!! Then girl watches over killer in her own new home that was left to her. So she pretty much adopted the killer cause he is a mental midget. I was really enjoying the movie up to the part when the girl actually sided with the killer from there it went down hill really quickly.

The audio was very good and so was the picture quality. The 3D was well done. lots of really good depth and several good pop outs like teeth flying out of a guys mouth,blood squirting all over and yes plenty of chainsaws are going right through your tv. With a better story i would have given this atleast 4 stars but the ending to this movie was really bad and really goes all over the place and not in a good way.

I would say

audio 4/5
picture 4/5
3d 4/5
story 2/5

Side note- they do in the opening show a few scenes of the orginal TCM in 3d and it actually looks pretty darn good. I would love to see them go back and give the original a 3d treatment.",1368576000,,2379,4.053191489361702
4771703,5,B005LAIIAI,"I have never watched the English Patient, and I never will. On the other hand, I have indeed watched Texas Chainsaw. What more can really be said about this film? Honestly. So, let's dig into the tech specs...

Video: My sources indicate that we are looking at MVC (3D) and AVC (2D) encoded 1080p transfers in 2.40:1 ratio. I can tell you that the producers were going for a dark looking film. I think that they accomplished this and so much more. Image contrast is overall impressive, but in a few instances we suffer from some minor shadow detail loss. Good enough for me.

Audio: Very loud chainsaws? Check. Lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix? Checkmate! Bring it up a notch, lads.

Extras: Hello, folks! You get not 1 not 2 but 3, yes - three - count them, Audio Commentaries. Are you friggin kidding me? Who does that anymore? All the goodies here are presented in 1080p for you maximum enjoyment. Forget about it!

I cannot comment on the 3d presentation at this time. However, this high-def release makes me want to ""borrow"" the 3d glasses from the movie theater, for some unexplained reason. Just do yourself a favor and get some Leatherface!",1368576000,5,1152,4.632352941176471
4771704,3,B005LAIIAI,"Its been thirty-nine years since Leatherface first revved up his chainsaw in Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre followed by two sequels and two remakes with the latter getting a prequel. The franchise seemed to be dead until this year's 3D release of Texas Chainsaw. It completely ignores the sequels and remakes, but it is a direct sequel to the 1974 original.

Honestly, I don't know what all the hype is about the original movie. I saw it once on Showtime when I was a teenager and I thought it was pretty tame compared to other slasher films. The first sequel is tolerable, while the third movie tried to be both a sequel and a remake, which was a complete disaster. The Next Generation starring Rene Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey was a modern day remake (though some consider it to be a loose sequel) that was shelved for three years until it was released direct-to-video. I prefer to watch the gritty 2003 remake starring Jessica Biel or even the pointless prequel.

The 3D sequel/reboot takes place directly after the original movie with the police and mob surrounding the Sawyer farmhouse, demanding them to give up Leatherface. The Sawyers attempted to give Leatherface up, but the mob of Newt, Texas burn down the farmhouse with the Sawyers in it. The only two surviving member was a baby, Edith, which was taken in by a couple and Verna Carson.

Heather (Edith) Miller's life is forever changed when she receives a letter stating she had inherited her late grandma's estate, which leads her to discover that she was adopted. Heather, along with her boyfriend, Ryan, their friends, Nikki and Kenny, travels to Newt, Texas. They pick up a hitchhiker, Darryl, before meeting the family lawyer at the estate. He gives Heather some strange keys, a letter from her grandmother, and the security code to the gate.

Heather and her friends are excited about the big house, but lurking in the basement is Leatherface, who begins killing her friends one by one. After being picked up by the police, Heather learns the startling truth that she is a Sawyer and Leatherface is her cousin.

There are several continuity errors within this film. The first movie takes place in 1973, so Heather would have probably been born in 1973, but the actress looks like she is in her middle twenties, which would place this movie around 1998! But the problem is that cop uses a smart phone in the movie, one scene shows the gas prices in the three dollar range, and the death date on Verna's tombstone is in 2012. They could have avoided these mistakes by casting an older actress.

I actually thought Texas Chainsaw was another remake when I popped into the DVD player tonight. I was surprised and kind of excited to see parts of the original film in the opening. The acting throughout is your typical horror acting, meaning it is below average, which of course the horrible dialogue didn't help much either. Take note of the deputy as it is played Clint Eastwood's son, Scott Eastwood. The movie went a little too fast in killing off Heather's friends and the death scenes could have been better executed, or least the camera angles could have been better. There are a few twists and turns in the second half starting with Leatherface's little stunt at the carnival and the revelation of Heather's family. It was odd seeing Leatherface become more of an anti-hero, but it somewhat works. Texas Chainsaw isn't the best out of the series, but it is the best ""real"" sequel the series has ever gotten.",1368489600,3,3497,4.743421052631579

They really tried to make this into a different style of Chainsaw movie where you are supposed to feel bad for Leatherface. They turn the tables on you and want to see if they can humanize Leatherface, which is ridiculous...the first part of the film he is chasing the main actress, and the last part they become a duo! REALLY?!? That bad...the acting is awful and there are no scary parts at all...and whats the point of the 3D when it is only used one time throughout the flick. They even put a cameo of the SAW figure (the pig mask guy) and don't even kill him off! what a waste of time this was...dont watch.",1368489600,10,842,4.30188679245283

Did any of these acting wannabes read the script before signing up for this crap?  Movie runs for about 90 minutes, took about 3 hours to put it together.  I watched it by myself and was embarrassed that I spent any time on it....They should be arrested for assault with a deadly script.  (Add your own insult here...).  BOMB!  And to think the Academy overlooked this one......I made it through about 50 mins. and quickly assigned this one to the Sell-Back Stack.",1368489600,9,578,4.643564356435643
4771707,1,B005LAIIAI,"Just got finished viewing the film on bluray and I can't help but feel that the $25 I spent at Target has gone completely to waste.

First off, because we've all heard it ad nauseum on every other review for this film, I did not take into consideration when viewing or writing the review for the film the inconsistencies in timeline (ie the main character being waaay too young to fit in with the rest of the storyline.)

The first thing that stuck out to me was the incredibly poor quality of the writing. Too much needless exposition (characters awkwardly mentioning to each other how they're ""really gonna enjoy that road trip we're going on for four days"") or just oversimplified writing (Hick Man: ""Hey, I just found this baby"" Hick Woman: ""Hooray! Can we really keep it?""). I kid you not, folks. The dialogue is THAT basic, and you probably read it in your mind with more enthusiasm and better delivery than you'll see from ANY of the actors in this film.

The second thing that struck me was the LAUGHABLY unbelievable scenarios (even for your standard slasher film, they're ridiculous). Example: At the beginning of the film, a group of hicks burns down the family's farmhouse with the family inside, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SHERIFF, who explicitly forbids them from doing so beforehand. What does the sheriff do? Just rolls his eyes and watches as they lay waste to the farmhouse and murder an entire family, then tells the leader of the group ""this is on you!"" He then continues to watch the farmhouse burn for several hours. No arrests, no attempt to call the fire department to put out the fire, or to keep it from spreading. Nope. He just watches. Or when Leatherface is chasing the beaten, bloodied and screaming main character (""Help me! Please!"") around a CROWDED carnival, chainsaw blazing, and nobody else at the carnival even REACTS. At all.  It's just a bloody girl screaming for help and getting chased by a gore-splattered chainsaw-psycho wearing somebody else's face. Nothing to see here; carry on.

Thirdly, the acting is HORRENDOUS. Like TERRIBLE. As in ""the main character is practically smiling and calmly telling another character that all of her friends have just been murdered by a chainsaw-wielding psychopath"" bad. Or someone getting chopped on the shoulder with a hatchet, falling to the floor and, instead of attempting to dodge the ensuing blows or defend themselves, just laying on their stomach, arms at their side (despite there being a gun in reach) screaming for 10 seconds as they continue to be chopped in the back. NO EXAGGERATION. AT ALL. I was actually somewhat surprised to see performances THIS bad, especially from the lead girl, primarily because a major film studio released this film and they usually tend to have at least some meager standards for what constitutes as an ""audience-ready"" performance from the cast in order for a film to even get to post-production. Seriously, anyone who's seen the abysmal TCM: Next Generation film released in the 90's will find better acting therein. Every single performance in this film is terrible - there are no show-stealers or hidden gems. Just REALLY bad acting all around.

Fourth, the editing is atrociously bad. Some of you reading might be asking ""what do I care about editing?"" Well, you'll care when you see a meat hook coming to stab a character AT THE SPEED OF SNAIL. And yet the music cues the shrieking violin. Or extended moments of watching Leatherface just limp around. For no apparent reason. (""We needed extra filler, so we thought we'd just throw in snippets of Leatherface limping for 30 seconds or so..."") This footage should have been lining the cutting room floor instead of ""gracing"" the screen. Here's another reason why you should care: The lack of even decent editing robs the film of any potential it might have had to be even REMOTELY atmospheric or suspenseful. How do they expect the audience to jump when they're gonna show you a good 10 seconds of Leatherface lumbering after his victims, chainsaw buzzing, giving anyone ample opportunity to escape?

Fifth, the makeup and effects are pretty rudimentary. The skin mask looks like a cheap vinyl Halloween mask, a lot of the blood is clearly CGI, and the quality of the gore makeup and effects (Leatherface flaying skin from a half-conscious man's face) is only comparable to that which you might see on Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Bones.

Given all these aspects, if I was pressed to name ANYTHING I found redeeming or rewarding about viewing this film, I'd draw a blank. The gore factor is low; the acting's bad; the dialogue is horrible; the story is inconsistent and weak; there is no mood, atmosphere or suspense; there are no scares at all; Leatherface looks and acts like a 60 year old (the only real storyline consistency present in the film) and isn't frightening by any stretch of the imagination. Just an overall bad movie.

If you buy it, you'll most likely regret it. I do. Just saying.",1368489600,13,4971,4.811475409836065
4771708,5,B005LAIIAI,"Blood, guts, hot chicks, chainsaws. Hell yeah!

4771709,3,B005LAIIAI,"Okay this is suppose to be a sequel to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.. which already had a few sequels already that were pretty good in my opinion.. especially the original sequel that was horror/comedy and two decent sequels after that. Then we got the TCM remake in 2003 which was ok, then the prequel to that in 2006(which is still my favorite TCM yet).. Now in 2013 we have a so called sequel to the original 70s film. I'm not going to make a long speech about the plot cause most of you have already read about it or someone has told you what it's about it, i will say that it's OK and entertaining, it has plenty of gore, a few good scares and this Leatherface pretty damn creepy.

4771710,4,B005LAIIAI,"Let me start by saying this is not as great as the 2003 remake of the first film, but it still deserves a view for any die hard horror fan or fan of the Chainsaw series. Movies of this style of horror generally don't have a in depth story behind it which this one does. It basically picks up after the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre which include its opening credits. I think many reviewers are being quite hard on this film. It is one of the typical horror movie: scary, lots of blood and gore, dumb people and so on. In that case, it is nothing out of the ordinary. With that said, don't take the reviews too seriously. If you really want to see it, rent it and you be the judge. You may end up really enjoying it like I did!",1368489600,5,729,4.104895104895105
4771791,3,B005LAIIAI,"There's no question (to me, anyway) that none of the sequels or remakes have managed to compare to the original. For one, they're all too glossy and the feeling of watching a documentary or a grainy news reel has never been attempted again. What these sequels and remakes have managed to do is turn the Leatherface character into a monstrous ""boogey man"" and take away his human element in favor of a towering, seemingly unstoppable monster like Jason Voorhees. Until this film, that is.

Because, really, this film does manage to get at least one thing right that no other sequel has managed: it reminds you that Leatherface is a human being. I won't elaborate because it would require the use of spoilers, but we're reminded of Leatherface's humanity and vulnerability several times in this film. He isn't an all-powerful monster and, unlike Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees, you can take him on.

Another thing this film manages to get right is the idea of real human evil--let's just say there's more than one villain in the film, though this time we have to do without sight of R. Lee Ermey doing his best bits from his Full Metal Jacket days.

The plot is as you'd expect from a Texas Chainsaw film, so I won't comment on that. There's a good combination of just enough set up and ensuing action. Too many slasher films these days don't seem to understand the need to pace yourself. They either jump straight into the craziness or take forever and lose the audience. This film gets it right.

As for the action, there's plenty once things get rolling.

The acting is fine. I'm not going to say it was great, because it wasn't. Was it good enough for the 7th film of a horror franchise? Yes.

Really, there isn't all that much to say about Texas Chainsaw other than it does what its supposed to do. Those feeling disappointed are asking too much from a horror film that is literally the third reincarnation of the original story. The series has managed to branch off into three different franchises over the course of seven films. The fact that this one was entertaining and fun to watch is about all anyone can realistically expect from it. And in that regard, it delivers.",1368489600,2,2179,4.632124352331606
4771792,1,B005LAIIAI,"I have been a horror fan for the better part of 30 years. I am very well versed in the Texas Chainsaw lore and I work in marketing and PR. That being said, everything about this movie was done wrong. For starters, the writers ignored the story line that was already present with the first TCM. It was risky to ignore the last 3 movies in the original continuity as well as the re imagined movies. The writers insulted the fans of the original movie who actually understood that the movie was supposed to take place after the original, by completely ignoring the time line. The beginning of the movie takes place after the events of the original in 1973 and continues 40 years later. Apparently someone could not do math. Was it that hard to make the lead character a 20 year old descendant/grand daughter? The premise was interesting enough, but was executed poorly. A TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 3D MOVIE SHOULD WRITE ITSELF, how did you mess this up? It's a simple enough formula: Leatherface is the killer, chainsaws, blood, suspense and cannibalism that may or may not be blatant. The 3D was not important in this movie. It added depth but was really unnecessary. The could have used the effect to it's potential, but they also failed at that. Possible Plot Spoiler Alert: At one point in the movie an attempt is made to make Leatherface more human. The writers fail at trying to make the viewer feel sympathy for a character who is supposed to be a mildly retarded cannibalistic killing machine. Everything that was done in this movie was half-assed including the release. They could have released this as an unrated 3D Bluray, but instead released it via streaming video 2 weeks ago unrated and the release that we will get will be a rated version of the movie. This was the final nail in the coffin for this movie/franchise. Who buys horror movies? Fans do. What horror fan wants a watered down version of a movie they pay for? No one. Good job morons. The movie is already available online unrated and on every bit torrent out there, so why would anyone pay for this version? I'll wait til it hits the bargain bin. Hopefully the franchise is sold to a company that will do something decent with it.",1368403200,,2202,4.591370558375634
4771793,4,B005LAIIAI,"What a saga! Seven movies based on Ed Gein's madness... the bastard should be proud, don't you think so?
Well, this movie has little about the original fact. Sure, you have Leatherface wearing a dead skin mask and creating a new one in the movie but Tobe Hooper's movie was really more into it.
""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is a follow-up to this first movie but in the saga, the second Hooper movie is a follow-up too, so is the third movie! Each movie seems to ignore other events created after the original first act from 1974. Anyway, it's not the most important. Here we begin with a direct scene that ends the very first footage : Sally met cops and it's trouble time for the Sawyer family but who are that rednecks gang? Ten people (including the hitchhicker)... where are they from?
Then we move to now... fourty years after but the hero is about 25! Where are the missing years? The plot takes place from a legacy and that includes the only remaining family member : Leatherface. And now it's revenge-time for the big boy with his chainsaw. And it's weird because all we can say is ""yes"" : we show sympathy for the killer, for his family and we want him to succeed. Ain't life bizarre? The ""good people"" should die if we follow the plot, and it's the right move because at the end, we feel ok with it.
You'll have your blood & guts delivery, no problem : the bodycount is pretty impressive! Expect hammer, chainsaw, pitchfork, guns and flames plus a very special inventive ending for one of the characters at the end of the movie. It was fun watching it!
The story is what it is : with errors but forget about it. It's only a new way for the legend to live on and it does. I liked the movie but a few minutes are missing for climax, explanations... it's a bit fast. You want your red flesh flying around so you don't want to go too much into words, fine, but it's a bit too fast for me, some things are not in place.
I understand many will dislike this new movie because you will compare ""2013"" to ""1974"". Tobe Hooper was giving a social commentary and here not. It was the hardest you could do - not blood but pressure, that damned madness squeezing your veins and fear. Here, don't expect those things. Because you know you have a giant killer using a mechanic saw like a maniac and that the 70's effects are not what people want now : today, you have blood and meat on the ground when forty years ago, you should thought you would see it and nothing really happened. The first movie seems so shy with blood... and now it pours like Niagara falls!! The way movies are made is different, the expectations are differents so ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is necessary different but mainly seems like a classic slasher movie. You know Leatherface will come and kick the young ones' ass and you expect a lot of blood and flesh when it was just suggested in 1974. This new one is a typical horror movie for the 2000's. The effects are sometimes not well done : CGI are not my cup of tea. prosthatics are way better and old fashioned effects style still rules when you do a horror movie.
So, I loved the movie, I know most of horror fans will hate it finding it dumb, predictable and lame due to its legacy but Leatherface is still there and rules!",1368316800,,3233,4.345454545454546

4771795,4,B005LAIIAI,"TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D is one of those films that stirs up a lot of controversy among genre fans.  Not because it's particularly brutal or gory, but because of how it changes the original mythology of its preceding film(s).  True, it does add to the existing mythology...but this film also changes the perception of how we should view the Sawyer family.  This is both a good and bad thing.  But regardless of whether you agree with that or not, this film is a lot of fun.

I saw the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE when I was about 14.  Interestingly enough, I was living in the Texas panhandle at the time, so the film struck a chord with me.  I've been a big-time fan ever since and have even dressed up as Leatherface on a couple of occasions (holiday-wise, of course...not just for my own entertainment).

When I first watched TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D, I was a little unsure of how I felt.  I enjoyed the film as a whole...but it really changes the perspective on how we should look at the Sawyer family.  The original movie makes them out to be vicious, psychotic cannibals...but this film changes that view and gives a more, well, human side to them.

It is this humanism that causes all the debate.  Gore-hounds and die-hard fans scream that this film should have nothing to do with the original and that it should not be added to the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE canon.  Others feel that it is a perfect addition to the mythology and gives a new and unique take on the homicidal family.

In the end, I decided that I enjoyed TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D, and I actually like how they shifted our perceptions of the Sawyers.  It's nice to see a good, gory flick like this one that has a bit of heart.  Speaking of gore, though, I have to admit that some of it is my sole reason of complaint:  they used CG for a bit of it that could have been monumentally awesome if it had been done with practical effects.

But don't let that dissuade you from checking out this film.  I recommend giving it a look, if for any reason to see if you agree or disagree with the abstract changes they made.",1368057600,3,2067,4.3921052631578945

4771797,4,B005LAIIAI,"Whether you are a fan of the horror genre or not, you have to love a good story. If you are a fan of the horror genre then you know that a good story is what has been lacking in horror movies as of late. This movie definitely has its funny moments, isn't chock full of gore, while it does have its gory moments, and is story driven. Written by Adam Marcus, Debra Sullivan, Kirsten Elms and directed by John Luessenhop, Texas Chainsaw 3D is the best movie in the franchise since Tobe Hooperfs original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released in 1974. Taking the helm of the saw is Dan Yeager, who plays the best Leatherface since Gunnar Hansen. Also starring Alexandra Daddario(Percy Jackson) and Trey Songz(Step Up 2). For fans of the TCM franchise you will be pleased to see cameos from Gunnar Hansen, Bill Moseley, and John Dugan just to name a few.

Texas Chainsaw 3D picks up right where the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre left off and acts as a direct sequel to that movie. This movie wipes the slate clean from all other sequels and re-makes and starts a whole new chapter. At the end of the original TCM the survivor girl gets away and that is where this movie picks up at. Without giving any spoilers, letfs just say that her getting away leads to something very tragic for Bubba Sawyer aka Leatherface. We jump to current day, which is actually supposed to be just twenty years later, but there's a small issue in the timeline which I'll touch on in a minute. Our survivor girl, Heather, finds out she had a grandmother she never knew about in Newt, Texas pass away; leaving Heather with her estate. With this news Heather finds out she was adopted. Along with her boyfriend and a couple other friends, they load up in a van and head to Newt, Texas so Heather can take the keys to the Sawyer house and hopefully learn more about who she really is. Little does she know she has been left with more than just a house. She has yet to meet her cousin, Leatherface, who is locked up in the basement.

As the story unfolds, and friends begin to die, Heather begins to discover more about her family roots. Not only that, but we also discover there are bigger monsters in Newt, Texas than Leatherface. When you watch the movie, you will understand what I mean by that statement. There is one tiny flaw in the timeline of this movie that has a bunch of fans in an uproar and I want to take a moment to touch on it. The original takes place in 1974, in which Heather is just a baby. Judging by Heather's age we jump roughly twenty odd years into the future, making it 1994 or so. Herein lies the issue. There is a scene where a local police officer is investigating the crime scene and he is using his smart phone to shoot a live video feed back to the police station where the sheriff and mayor watch on one of their phones. In the mid 1990s there were no smart phones with live video chat. You take the cell phone out of that scene and you have one of the most solid horror movies in quite awhile, so that is a minor detail in the grander scheme of things in my opinion. The ending to Texas Chainsaw 3D was amazing! It puts everything into perspective and you even have a moment where you feel sympathetic towards Leatherface.",1367884800,3,3235,4.36318407960199

I never seen any Texas Chainsaw movies before this one and I had an open mind going into this movie. I see all the other reviews and most of the bad reviews say they don't like it because they liked the older ones. They don't have open minds and are just comparing to what they liked before. And, I don't get why they think that way.

I understand this story and loved it. It made sense. The acting was pretty good, but I know some weren't as good as others. I love the cast though. They picked a super hot girl to play the main actress.

This movie got me interested in watching the older Texas chainsaws movies. It was just to see what all those bad reviews were saying about how great the older ones were. They couldn't had been so wrong!!!

I saw all the old movies after watching the newest movie. I don't understand what people are saying? All those old movie weren't that great?!?! In fact, they suck!!! Then, I read about them, and I see why they loved them so much. The first movie, 1974, was basically, the first scary movie they had with a chainsaw guy and audiences have never seen such a thing and were really scared over it and loved it. They just like it because it was the first time, they ever did such a thing. Big deal. It isn't scary!

I watched it in modern times with friends. Everyone said, is this a joke? lol  I wasn't even scared one tiny bit. I thought the leatherface looked so stupid and dumb as hell. All those old school tricks are so tried and boring. Most of the ""scary"" scenes, are funny! In fact, I laughed throughout the whole movie! ha ha ha

The same goes with the 2nd movie, 1986, and the 3rd movie 1990. They were terrible movies and made no sense!!! Super bad acting all over the place.

Only the more modern movies were a bit better, 2004 and 2007. That's when I actually started liking the series. It looked like they actually started to give an effort to making people scared and had pretty decent stories to them.

Finally, I like to say that this newest Texas Chainsaw is the BEST!!! It beats all the previous movies by a mile. 5 miles compared to the original, 1974, movie.

You all need to watch this movie quick!!!",1367798400,3,2204,4.2764423076923075
4771800,1,B005LAIIAI,"When I first heard that this latest installment of the Texas Chainsaw and
that it was touted to be a follow on from the original, I was somewhat intrigued,
and hopeful. However, this was not to be the case.

It started out promising enough within the first five minutes but my
disappointment hit like a pick-axe to the face. It began with the opening scene
at what was meant to be the original house (as we all know it has now been removed
and is a bed & breakfast somewhere in Texas). The ""house"" looked way too freshly
painted and out of context from the original, dilapidated residence.

The shootout scene with the police and the ""family"" was embarrassing to
say the least, as an entire cast of additional ""family"" members
appears in the scene...why? If were meant to be a ""follow on"" from the
original.

Then there was the 3rd rate acting from the entire cast throughout the
remainder of the film, the jump from the ""follow on"" to modern day times was
so confusing to say the least that I wondered if I had somehow changed films.
It lacks in terror, it lacked in everything that made the original Tobe Hooper
classic, just that a ""classic"". I couldn't even bring myself to even watch this
a second time, even if it were to be done ironically.

I was shocked when I saw Lions Gate Films name was attached to this debacle,
traffic accident of a film. John Luessenhop the director behind this travesty
should not by any means be let loose on a film set ever again, at any cost!
What he created was nothing more than an embarrassment and akin to a 3rd graders
finger painting to stick to a proud parent's refrigerator for no one else to see.

Alexandra Daddario, one of the main actor's, as much as she is a pretty little thing
on screen her acting abilities need some more work. She probably does have potential
on some level but I am afraid that she needs way more work before I would see her in a
film again.

To finish up it was a boring, unexciting, lacking in horror, terror and everything
else that made the original a classic. It was like a high school production on all
levels.",1367539200,,2087,4.407792207792208

The house seems perfect and they are all excited until one of them finds a hidden room, and accidentally release a chainsaw wielding mad man bent on revenge. I have a confession to make. I have never seen any Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. I know they have a ton but I haven't had any desire to see any. After watching this I can see why. I also have to admit that I am pretty much over movies that are made just to show gore and people getting cut up. I know they tried to put a story in this and they almost succeeded but really its an hour and a half of people being hacked up. If you are into those type of movies then you will like this. For me if I'm gonna watch people being cut up I'd rather see the Saw movies, at least there is a plot to those.

4771847,1,B005LAIIAI,"I was absolutely blown away leaving the theater after seeing Texas Chainsaw 3D, and not in a good way.  At how someone could completely screw up a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film so bad.  At least TCM the new generation was corny enough to make you laugh at it and have fun.  Everything about this movie was just bad.  The acting, the plot, dialogue, I mean there isn't one good thing I can say about this one.

First of all, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre took place in 1974.  Our characters are now in their early 20's, but somehow we have iPhones?  That also means we have a 50 or 60 year old leatherface running around.  Speaking of the main character, Heather I think(who cares), where did she even come from??  Who were all these people at the Sawyer house at the beginning of the film???  In the original there was leatherface, the father, the hitchhiker, and grandpa.  This is supposed to be the REAL sequel to the original so why do we have a woman and child(and various other random people) at the Sawyer house??

I can overlook things like this if the movie isn't claiming to be the actual, true sequel to the original.

As far as the rest of the movie.  The characters are all dumb and unlikable, and you will be rooting for them to die.  Everyone in the movie does completely dumb things including the Sheriff, mayor, deputy, lawyer, and anyone else you can think of.

This movie has zero redeeming qualities and this comes from someone who loves all kinds of horror movies.  Avoid at all costs.  Don't even waste money on a rental.",1365120000,3,1548,4.487455197132617

4771849,5,B005LAIIAI,"It's been about 8 years since we last saw Leatherface in the cinema and finally after all this time he gets the justice he deserves, the remake in 2003 was pretty good but it lacked a lot in that it's a horror movie with hardly any blood and guts! But this new version is a splatterfest!! Lionsgate certainly have done a better job than Newline did with it, the story continues immediately after the events of the original 1970s version which is great as it incorporates footage from the original during the open sequence then cuts straight into what happened next, you can forget about the awful original parts 2 and 3 as they have been completely disregarded which is for the best. The story cuts to years later as new events take place, the story is very good and well paced with a pretty decent cast to carry it, Leatherface looks brilliant and exactly similar to the original and the film is not shy of the red stuff, plenty of chainsaw action as Leatherface really take centre stage now as the lead villain, the gore is very good and it's the first time we see somebody really cut in half!! I really don't understand the negativity for this it could have been much worse is it had been another Michael bay production, there are a few discrepancies in the time line but nothing major people are just nitpicking, its certainly one of the best movie maniac films in a while and Leatherface is awesome, if you're a fan of good horror movies this is certainly a must see.

4771893,3,B005LAIIAI,"I wasn't at all thrilled with this movie as a Texas Chainsaw movie, but I generally LOVED it as a bad horror flick!  It had a great story idea, but a combination of poor delivery/execution and a departure from The Texas Chainsaw ""family values"" guillotined its potential.

A very inexperienced director (John Luessenhop; Takers) has failed to continue delivering the well-pedigreed success of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise reboot.  While many people complain about the reboot remake in 2003 and the follow-up prequel The Beginning (2006), they followed in the tradition of brutally torturing and psychologically flaying young groups of off-the-trail road trippers surrounded by ""oh my God"" moments.  Whether you loved them or hated them, and for whatever reason, you winced and gritted your teeth while trying not to look away.  This latest installment neither made me wince nor flinch.  The scares were hardly present, I never had a sense of suspense or dread or terror, and the brutality was outstandingly minimal compared to all other Texas Chainsaw movies.  Clearly, the branding was lost.

Heather (Alexandra Daddario) learns that her grandmother willed her a Texas mansion in a small town.  This also comes with the discovery that she was stolen, not adopted, by her ""parents.""  She travels to visit her newly inherited manor with her friends Ryan (Trey Songz), Nikki (Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (Keram Malicki-Snchez), and they pick up shockingly friendly hitchhiker Carl (Scott Eastwood) on the way.

These kids aren't great actors.  But they do fine.  And Heather and Nikki are off the charts hot!  So hot, in fact, that all camera angles meant to frame ""the cast"" actually use Nikki's ass as the foreground and Heather's abby, cropped-shirt stomach as the background, with the male characters somewhere in between.  LOL.  This is NOT a joke at all and it happens multiple times.  [This may sound like negative criticism, but it's not. I love it!]

This young group reaches the manor and decides to stay, party and explore.  While doing this, they basically follow The Cabin in the Woods playbook.  Two characters wander off alone.  People discover things like secret doors and investigate by themselves.  They play loud music so Ryan (played by Trey Songz) can't hear his friend dying over the Trey Songz hit ""Ladies and the Drinks.""  Nikki drinks, does drugs and tries to seduce her best friend's boyfriend out in the barn--THE BARN!!!  Oh, and Heather tests the audience's patience by seeing how many times she can fall while being chased.  [This may sound like negative criticism, but it's not. I love it!]

Why is all this happening?  Because evidently Leatherface still lives there.  Should Heather have known that?  Well, maybe.  Her grandmother left her an important letter which she never got around to reading until the end of the movie.

The action finale is more of an understated ""fight"" than a blaringly loud, desperate, blood and sweat-drenched chase scene--which branded the franchise in horror fans' psyches.  This struck me as a MAJOR mistake.  It was not only done poorly, but even done ""well"" it was terribly ill-suited for the Leatherface character they built up in this film.  Thankfully, the not-so-twisty twist at the end made up for it with good intentions on the writers' part.  A sequel or additional installment of some sort is obviously on its way, but I hope they return to the family dynamic of past installments that just seemed to make the ""sickness"" of The Texas Chainsaw series work.

LEATHERFACE:  In this film his character goes largely unexplained.  Past movies use family bullying, psychological manipulation and sexual undertones to explain what drives this lug and aims his rage.  All we learn in this movie is that he's obsessed with masking himself in human flesh and, in about 15 seconds of the movie, it's suggested that he may feminize himself with make-up and women's clothing.

THE STORY: The writers managed to construct an interesting, plausible story linking the end of the first movie of the ""original franchise"" with this reboot installment.  The story elements are actually much cooler than previous installments had to offer.  However, the poor presentation of the horror, terror, brutality, surreal macabre, and psychological torture that branded the original franchise just wasn't here--rendering these impressive story ideas less effective.  This was unfortunate.

TIMELINE:  This movie serves as a present day setting sequel to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) as if the original franchise sequels 2 & 3 and then The Next Generation (1994) never happened.  But can we just point out that the lead actress is 26, she looks younger, she's probably playing a character younger than 26, and the original Texas Chainsaw movie (1974) came out 39 years ago when her lead character was between 6 and 12 months old.  Now, hey, I get that today's movie releases may ""take place"" 10 or 20 years in the past.  But the local police cars in this movie are all low-jacked with locations presented on an HDTV at HQ and a cop provides a live video feed with his SmartPhone.  So, yes, it takes place NOW.  So either our lead chick looks AMAZING at 40 years old or the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) took place about 14 years in the future--for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Nope, that's out, too.  Heather saw a newspaper article about the original ""massacre"" in a police evidence box.

THE GORE:  It was abundant.  But there really wasn't so much for a Texas Chainsaw movie, and it was often delivered with less of a cringing intensity.  There were oodles of blood trails (from dragging bodies), but not so much in the way of actively drawing blood and opening wounds spewing about.  A lot was presented after the fact or more in the background of the shot rather than the focus of the camera angle (e.g., when Leatherface is amputating limbs on his work table).  There was also basically no torture, just flat out killing for the most part, with no lead in of terror, toying or torture. The major exception to all this was a very satisfying face-peeling scene--that was my major wincing ""ooooh weee"" scene.

CAMEOS:  A small victory for fans of the franchise is that familiar faces like Gunnar Hanson (stock footage Leatherface; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers) cameos as one of the two actors playing Jed ""Leatherface"" Sawyer and Bill Mosely (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2; The Devil's Rejects) cameos as Drayton Miller during the intro flashback scenes. Even the young local Deputy Darryl (Shaun Sipos; Final Destination 2, The Grudge 2, Lost Boys: The Tribe) will likely be recognized by horror regulars.

3-D:  I saw this in 3D and, sadly, the 3D added nothing too it. Some people generally find 3D more exciting and they may appreciate it.  However, spectacles were more often obscured than enhanced by the 3D filming, especially blood.  The fact that this was presented in 3D, of course, warranted that Leatherface attack ""the camera"" with his chainsaw so that we'd be all ""oooooh my God, it's coming right for us!""",1362960000,39,7126,4.995755517826825

I worship the original, it is my favorite movie of all times and as a fan generally speaking Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation was considered by most as the worst of ANY of the sequels, prequels or redo's.

I mean the main girl in this is in her early 20's and was born right after the 73' massacre, so the movie would take place in the mid to late 90's right? Not unless someone traveled back in time and brought an iPhone with them. Also there is a grave that marks a person's death in 2012. There is nothing scarier than a 60-year-old Leatherface chasing you down. If you can get past these huge flaws by the writers, there is some slasher enjoyment to be had.",1362268800,54,673,4.392
4771897,5,B005LAIIAI,"It's been about 39 years since Tobe Hooper's masterpiece came out, which Is the original TCM. It has become a cult classic, even with a mere budget of only $60,000. About 12 years later, we get TCM II, which honestly had no relevance to its predecessor. Now, every horror fan's dream has come true; a REAL, modern sequel to the original.
 I'm not going to write a synopsis of the film, because that's what IMDB is for. I will, however, tell you why this film is so extravagant. For starters, the film is loaded with blood and gore. It's not enough gore to make a horror buff cringe, but it's definitely enough to make one go ""Wow. That was.. cool!"" Next, we have cameos from a few of the original actors, including Marilyn Burns (Sally Hardesty), and Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface). For this sole reason, the film is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Finally, what did it for me was the story. The ending is what gets the most crap from reviewers of this movie, but it was honestly just.. different from what one would expect. I would compare it to Frankenstein, in the fact that it's terrifying, but also kind of sweet. Just because it's different from what a normal horror movie ending entails does not mean it's bad. In my opinion, it's this factor that makes the movie better.
 To all those who trash this movie, I don't understand why you do. It's got blood, gore, boobs, all-star cameos, and an ending that sets up the plot for the next movie in an oh-so satisfying matter, much like Halloween. The sequel to this film will most likely pick up at the last shot of this movie, which is always satisfying. For any avid horror fan, I highly recommend this movie. It's definitely worth the money, and the 3D is just a bonus. I mean, who doesn't love to see severed limbs and carnage thrown in their face? Not to mention the 3D nudity. For you ladies, Trey Songz's hot six pack abs are sure to fulfill your lustful thoughts. He's also not a bad actor. Who knew?
 All in all, this is a great film. I highly recommend it. If you're skeptical, play safe and rent it. Either way, this is one film worth seeing.",1362268800,8,2098,4.416020671834626

8477793,3,B005LAIIAI,"Having seen all of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies up to this one (as of writing this I have yet to see Leatherface) I can say that Texas Chainsaw [3D] is not the worst, but also definitely not the best, of the TCM franchise. In my opinion there was no good TCM movie after the first one. All of the others are subpar in their canonical inconsistencies and reliance on horror cliches. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre set the standard for what a good horror movie of this variety is, and somehow it has been hard for anyone to do the original film justice. The original sequels were bad, the remakes were bad, and this reboot sequel is hardly any better.

That being said, there are actually elements to this film that I appreciated enough to rate it at least three stars. (Minor spoilers in the following.) Primarily, the plot is very interesting, albeit handled very poorly with incredibly bad writing. The idea of Leatherface being a family protector is not new, and in fact I'd say Texas Chainsaw keeps true to the original movie in that respect. However, Leatherface as well as the Sawyer family were portrayed too nobly in this movie. They are a family of back-country cannibals. This movie tried to make us forget that. Leatherface was portrayed as a singular oddity in an otherwise normal upper-class family heritage, and it really didn't work.

Ultimately, Texas Chainsaw is just another cliche slasher film with a big title tacked onto it. It suffers from similarly poor writing as the other sequels and remakes in the franchise, resulting in obvious inconsistencies between it and the original classic it's supposed to be a direct sequel of. Despite that, it is less cringy than some of the other films in the franchise, and is actually a fairly interesting watch if you suspend your disbelief for the many issues it has.
