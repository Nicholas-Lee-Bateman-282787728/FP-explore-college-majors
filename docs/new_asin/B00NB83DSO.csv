6637478,1,B00NB83DSO,This video was a disappointment since the content was not geared to doing exercises but rather to watch a series of instructional sections that did not induce me to want to follow.,1421625600,21,180,4.65625
6637479,1,B00NB83DSO,The video explained how to do each exercise but did not take you through all the reps...left you to do that on your own..not a video to exercise along with. Disappointing.,1421366400,26,171,4.548387096774194
6637480,5,B00NB83DSO,"The exercises are explained in laymans terms and easy to follow.  Im fairly active and was able to go through most of them without too much difficulty.  There are some activities to improve your balance on the DVD.  I thought they would be fairly simple, but I realized that my balance wasn't as good as I thought it was. Will look out for the next in this series.  I liked the fact that these were physical therapy based exercises.",1416182400,12,432,4.430379746835443

6637482,5,B00NB83DSO,I'm not the type that loves going to the gym so I was looking for a workout I could do at home after my heart surgery.  I found Boom to be a great way to get some moderate exercise and get my fitness level back on track.  It's nothing flashy but the exercises are enjoyable and just right for someone getting started.  My wife is also happy because now we can exercise together.,1414886400,5,378,4.1506849315068495
6637483,4,B00NB83DSO,I recently decided to start working out after my doctor told me I needed to exercise more.  This DVD was the perfect introduction into exercising for me since it's been years since I actually went to the gym.  The best part of it is that I don't actually have to go to the gym.  I can just pop the DVD in my computer or TV and get a great workout whenever I feel like exercising.  I especially enjoyed the scientific aspect of the DVD that explained what muscles I was working and why.  I have recommend this exercise program to many of my friends who want to get more fit.,1414454400,11,573,4.172727272727273
6637484,4,B00NB83DSO,"I purchased the Boom! DVD for my in-laws whom are in their sixties. The production value isn't flashy but it's the exercises that are important. Delving into three main areas: flexibility, strength & posture and balance, Boom! presents the workout in a simple but effective manner. I can easily see how this video will keep seniors, or for that matter, anybody in shape.",1413331200,14,370,4.888888888888889
6637485,5,B00NB83DSO,"As an aging boomer and one who is looking for ways to remain or re-kindle my motivation to keep moving, this DVD is it!  I am amazed that I actually look forward to working it every day.  What really turned me on to this well-produced DVD is that it has been developed by medical and fitness specialists which means that the workout is safe for my 60-ish bones and muscles, it's presented in a way that's easy to follow, and it's so motivating.  I am amazed at how much more mobile I've become and how much better I feel!  If you can get your hands on BOOM!, grab it.  It is the only DVD that is as good or better than having your own personal trainer.",1410998400,21,652,4.142857142857143

6637493,5,B00NB83DSO,"Title:  Great workout after surgery

I was recently hospitalized and wanted to get back in shape.  Since my normal workout routine usually involves just walking, I decided to give Boom! a try after my friend told me she was doing it 3 times a week with good results.  The pace was perfect for me and I have worked it into my daily exercise routine.  The exercises were easy to follow, not too strenous, and just the right length (about 40 minutes).  I would recommend this workout to anyone looking to get back in shape.

8677118,1,B00NB83DSO,"This a very big disappointment and a total waste of my money,  It's not for seniors who haven't been exercising regularly.  They used a man who is obviously in very good shape.  Might have been in his sixties.  This man did the exercises and a young girl stood there, no music, and instructed him how to do the exercises.  And, of course, they were easy for the featured man.  It was a totally terrible concept.  This is only for seniors who are already in good shape and already know the exercises.",1516752000,,499,4.417582417582418

8677121,5,B00NB83DSO,This is a great stretching and strengthing workout for us older folks.  It is led by a physical therapist who guides you through.  I am wishing and waiting for another Boom! workout dvd.,1436745600,,186,4.606060606060606

8677125,1,B00NB83DSO,"This is more like therapy than an exercise workout. They tell you to repeat for X number of sets, rather than taking you through it. I only did it once! I also expected music, but there was none:( It was a disappointment.",1431302400,3,221,4.285714285714286
