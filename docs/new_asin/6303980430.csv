753937,5,6303980430,"I saw this at the West Newton Theater when it first came out in 1993 and really enjoyed it. Grew up with the '50s TV cowboys who I enjoyed as a child and later enjoyed Clint in his spaghetti westerns. This was a completely different approach to the western genre. I liked it so much that I took my wife to see it and then my daughter (18 years old at the time). All of us thought it was a well plotted, written, acted and directed movie. I just bought it to have around for when company comes and want to show someone something they probably haven't even heard of, let alone seen.

And I see that Amazon is offering Smoke Signals as a combo buy. A really great movie that I already own and also first saw at West Newton Theater. Terrific voice over reading of Dick Lourie's poem, ""How Do We Forgive Our Fathers"" at the end.",1385769600,,823,4.176100628930818

753940,4,6303980430,"The reason I really enjoyed this movie is that it is based on a true story.  So many are written about men, but to find a story of a socialite who had been outcasted by her father to survive in the Wild West is something I doubt most socialites back then would have had the fortitude to even try.  The difference here is that she had to disguise herself as a man so she wouldn't be raped or killed.  Even dressing up as a man was a hanging offense at the time.  Becoming a sharp-shooter, getting involved with the gold rush and even being able to vote (because they thought she was man), makes my heart soar knowing how well she represented ""true grit"".  Even though there is some violence in this, it is representative of the times to make it more believable.  I think it is good for ages 12 and up.",1364515200,3,800,4.196078431372549

754032,4,6303980430,"This astonishing film looks unflinchingly at the double standard between men and women in a feminist western that turns the genre on its head. Maggie Greenwald's astute, provocative movie does for women what almost no other film has done: portray her as a person first, with all the attendant difficulties that entails for a woman in frontier America.  Forget about passive aggressive sexual harassment in a corporate setting; this is a literal fisticuffs between the brutish male survivalists and the women who were ostensibly there only to fulfill their loutish needs, either as whores, wives and/or mothers, or cheap dispensable labor.

So when Josephine Monaghan, the daughter of a well-heeled family in Boston, is defiled and impregnated by the family photographer, she is one blamed and turned out to fend for herself after she gives birth.  She heads west and soon learns that an unescorted woman is fair game for any man--to be raped as soon as looked at, let alone be helped--and it's after a violent encounter with an attacker that she decides to do what any self-respecting woman trying to save her own skin would do: dress in men's clothing which in those days, unbelievably, was against the law.  She ends up in a shabby mining village and continues her charade as a man, spending a bitter winter in the wild tending a flock of sheep so she can earn enough money to build her own homestead.

She eventually becomes a solid, if not oddly-regarded member of the community, some of whom believe she might be queer because of her lack of interest in pursuing the opposite sex.  She proves her mettle again and again, not only in defending her homestead against the encroachment of a cattle baron who wants to drive her out, but also by befriending a Russian family and saving the life of a Chinese man (part of a chain gang used to build the railroads) who would have been hanged without her intervention; she begrudgingly takes him on as a ranch hand since those are the terms upon which the Tinman is set free.  The Tinman eventually discovers her secret, but before he does, it's interesting to note what happens when the roles are reversed: the (disguised) woman is now the one with the power and becomes the dominator (mostly to protect her identity); he is the acquiescing obedient.  Of course, everything changes once he knows her identity.

This is a remarkable, iconic film; it's what groundbreaking looks like.",1292544000,,2429,4.833734939759037
754033,5,6303980430,"This is an unusual and very interesting story about a woman trying o make her way as best she can in a brutally primitive environment.  Permanently cast out of her middle class family for a youthful lapse, she tries to make her way out west, eventually deciding to pose as a man so as to be left alone.  While there is some adventure to it, by far the best part of it is the evolution of the character Jo, whom Amis acts with a wonderful precision.

The best parts, at least for me, are the many silent moments when she makes major decisions that are never really articulated in any explicit way.  At first, she spends her winters alone, brooding on where life has led her, then building a ranch that would have been forbidden to her everyone not assumed she was a man.  It is one of the great introspective films that I have ever seen.  Though wounded, she struggles to grow and does so with great success, even finding an unusual love late in life.

Truly a beautiful film.  Amis' performance is truly great, bringing an entire environment into her psychological world.

Warmly recommended.",1263513600,,1092,4.530612244897959
754134,5,6303980430,Just one of those movies that really gets to you..you are absorbed into it until the very end!,1237507200,,94,4.277777777777778
754135,4,6303980430,"I found this to be one of those ""haunting"" films that has stayed with me. Suzy Amis' performance has stuck with me since I first saw this movie in 1994.

As for the story, yes it's hard to believe that no one would notice a ""man"" who never had any facial hair, whose voice was fairly high and had such narrow shoulders but despite the unrealistic premise, it's a good story that keeps your attention all the way without the need for action (although there is some.)

Amis does transform her looks from a fairly pretty woman to someone that looks like a frail 17-year-old boy. David Chung, who plays her Asian friend (well, more than that) also is very good and Bo Hopkins also has a strong contribution as the neighbor.

But this movie belongs to Amis all the way and just the painful looks on her face alone are memorable enough for me. What a haunting, sad look! Thus, it is not a happy story, but it's powerful one and worth seeing. Worth hearing, too, with some nice guitar work for the soundtrack.

If you are looking for a western that has a different angle, this certainly qualifies.",1232323200,4,1090,4.435
754136,1,6303980430,"Nothing positive can be said about the film ""The Ballad of Little Jo"", ranging from the lack of character development, to the pathetic attempt for a score, all the way to the shambled efforts to question sexual preference during the settlement era - this film coughed, wheezed, and ached from start to finish.  As an audience participant attempting to follow the rampant misuse of A to B to C connective following, I have to merely shake my head and cower in fear.  ""The Ballad of Little Jo"" tried, perhaps too energetically, to tell the story of a woman scored by the world and her attempts to live haphazardly in a male dominated society.  As the trailer concludes, the only roles for women during this period were wives or sexual fiends, and well, as you may have already guessed - Little Jo wanted to be neither.  So, she randomly scars herself, dresses as a man, mines for gold, lives a solitary life, until near the end when a discovery is made that neither rocks nor rolls anyone's feeble existence in this film.  This is a film where coherent thoughts are easily replaced by clich words, Ian McKellen, and at least a dozen miscast relationships that tirelessly lead you down a road where the scenery is bland and the road is unpaved.  It is just an unpleasant trip overall.

To say that there is nothing positive about ""The Ballad of Little Jo"" may be a bit harsh - so, in reality - there is ABSOLUTELY nothing positive about ""The Ballad of Little Jo"".  The biggest elements that move a film from beginning credits to ending credits are the characters, and ""Little Jo"" suffers from lackluster characters with transparent motives.  Some will argue that Suzy Amis ""delivers an outstanding performance as a woman passing as a man"", but this viewer found it unbelievable and chaotic.  Why was a scar needed to disguise her face?  Why didn't the photographer take her back?  What caused Josephine's father to react the way that he did?  In a barrage of flashbacks, we get this feeble story of how Jo came to the decision to transform her image.  Opening the door to the most incomplete scenes of the film, director Maggie Greenwald treaded lightly, giving us mere glimpses of her past instead of what should have been nightmarish remembrances.  The sound of her father's angry voice should have been repeated throughout the film, giving us a sense that Jo struggled with this throughout her life - but instead - they faded in an out continuously, giving us only short times to remember the truth before it was forgotten again.  The largest complaint with all the characters is that none of them push the question of ""why?""  Why did Jo leave her child?  Why didn't she just stay in a nearby neighborhood back east?  Why did she happen to ""friend"" nearly every person that she met?  Why didn't Jo have any enemies?  Where was the conflict among the characters, and to say that she had conflict with Ian McKellen's character or Bo Hopkins, would be rubbish.  She lived, like this film, randomly and transformed this film from pushing the sexual envelope to merely a documentary.  ""The Ballad of Little Jo"" had no message, simply demonstrating to us that if you wanted to escape, fool those who cared, and forget about the past - it was possible.

Suzy Amis was a major contributor to the downfall of the film, but the same blame can be placed on Mr. McKellen who left us more confused and bewildered with each tangent step.  Why did Jo befriend him?  What was his dark secret?  While he was essential to Jo understanding the ways of ""man"", he seemed more like filler than influence.  With no understanding of his motives, we are left with simply a shell of a character.  That could be said for everyone - shells with no life.  As we come full circle, another finger could be pointed at director Maggie Greenwald.  What was her purpose with this film?  Was it to critique gender roles throughout history or strike a chord with women's rights?  The message, like this film, is unclear.  She balanced uneven narratives with panoramic widescreen shots of the open land.  In one instance she introduced a new family to the characters, a group of foreign settlers staking their claim, and instead of developing a bond between Jo and these less influential characters, we are left with just a handful of moments that lead to an non-climactic moment.  Forced tears are constantly a staple of Greenwald's shots, but those man-made rivers go nowhere.  Tears were shed for this family, but without purpose the audience feels cheated and misplaced.  Greenwald is your average director, never quite reaching her full potential, while never slipping below the ""I learned this in Directing 101"" line.

Sloppy acting coupled with sloppy direction, my critique of there being nothing positive to say about this film stays firmly in place.  As I recall moments of this film, with the direction and acting firmly traveling a corrupt path, the two subsequently hurt the tone and pacing of the film.  Briefly mentioned above, there was some difficult transition between the questions ""why"" and ""how"".  Greenwald took liberties in the simplicity it was to transform one's self into a man.  Jo seemed to accomplish this feat in a mere matter of hours, and with no acting, was easily able to slip into the role.  This leads us to the ending, which (without giving any parts away), is a disaster because we work ourselves up for two hours, questioning Jo's every move that may consequently stumble upon the truth, only to get our wind let out as nothing happens to bring Jo full circle.  Realism?  One could argue that this was simply a ploy to end a train-wreck of a film, but with Greenwald behind the camera, anything is possible.  This was a waste of two hours, not even those hoping to say, ""...sexual questioning was alive during the settlements"", would be fooled by this one.  It is a cheap biography that fails to give us an accurate depiction of a brave heroine.

Overall, if you haven't already guessed it, I cannot support this film with any part of my body.  My heart hoped this would have been a darker film with more attention spent on the horror of man towards women, or at least a film about the struggling voice of a woman, but instead it was a shady film about one woman's ability to cower away from responsibility (she should have fought for her son) and trick everyone around her.  It was neither a sad film nor a persuasive film, as the moments of emotion were forced by Greenwald's camera and desire to build a ""pretty"" frame.  The characters suffered from missing souls, and the question of ""why"" suffered from not being asked enough.  Amis, Hopkins, and McKellen were atrocious in their respective roles as they never quite understood the period they resided.  ""Ballad of Little Jo"" was missing important elements like style, themes, reality, and cohesiveness.  It pounded the sidewalk angrily, but when approached - simply ran the other way.  While I was hoping it wouldn't be another ""Brokeback Mountain"", I was at least hoping for purpose, reason, or point, but found nothing but the truth that women could easily hide from men if randomly excommunicated from their families.  This was an embarrassment of a film, and a disappointment for those hoping for a clear, concise message about sexuality.  Skip this one - unless you like unbiased, unchallenging biographies.

Grade: * out of *****",1207872000,,7392,4.752156862745098
754137,4,6303980430,I really liked this film - very interesting crossing of sexual roles - Chinaman is the housewife; Little Jo performs all the masculine tasks.,1194134400,,141,4.916666666666667
754138,5,6303980430,"Loved this movie first because it was filmed around Red Lodge, Montana--where I lived for many years. The vistas are beautiful. Loved it more watching it again because it's a good story about frontier life for a woman. This film really makes you think about what women may have gone through during the settling of the west. Suzie Amis is a much under rated actress.",1125878400,5,365,4.630769230769231
754139,5,6303980430,"Great film, truthfully showing a fragment of what the times were like for women (and anyone who wasn't a white male!).  Beautifully protrayed by the actors. Excellent story if you are really interested the history of women, the old west, or how far we really have come in our values.",1091145600,9,283,4.66
754140,5,6303980430,"Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, hands down.  A ""sleeper"", that I caught by accident late one night as I was channel surfing, yawning and stretching for bed.  Within the first few minutes I was rivetted.  The film features excellence at every possible level, from camera work, casting, script,set, acting and of course direction.  This story in the wrong hands would have been a complete farce, but here we are treated to a story that is so believable (don't forget, it is based on a true story!) and gripping I still don't know how it is not a huge cult classic at the very least!  This woman's life-story is told with dignity, patience and a fearless honesty that few movies can approach.  The ending is particularly wonderful as are the love scenes between Little Jo and her Chinese lover.  Most of my friends consider me a bit of a ""foreign film snob"", truth is I just dislike ""Hollywood"" movies and have always felt that there has for years always been so many wonderful movies made in other countries that we have little access too!  In my opinion most of the time these films make US films look ridiculous.  However, this film, Maggie Greenwald et al restored my faith in the possibility that good movies, good ART could be made in the United States of America.",1089590400,12,1283,4.567685589519651
754141,5,6303980430,"The western had long been the last bastion of male supremacy for Hollywood.  With THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO, director Maggie Greenwald presents the same hostile west that bedeviled John Wayne decades ago, but this time the protagnist is a woman named Josephine (Suzy Amis), who enters the movie as a well-to-do eastern lady who has the bad fortune to have an illegitimate baby.  Her uncaring family casts her out, and Little Jo has no choice but to head west where she is subject to near rape.  To protect herself, she disguises herself as a man. Now this may sound as if the film could easily turn into something as ludicrous as a western TOOTSIE, but it does not.  Instead, Amis is totally convincing as a man who faces the same problems as if she were truly a man.  Amis meets several men (Ian McKellen and Rene Auberjonois) who at first help her, then turn on her.  She meets a Chinese man (David Chung), with whom she establishes first a friendly relation, then a physical one.  By the film's end, Amis has proved that the gender of a settler is less important in securing her place in the west than is the determination that she shows.  Heather Grahame does well in a secondary role, and newcomer Irina Passmoore also shines as two women, who in contrast to Little Jo, further stamp her as the first of the politically correct cowgirls.",1041724800,12,1340,4.554166666666666
754142,5,6303980430,"Before watching this, do not make the mistake of lumping this film in with silly cross dressing comedies like ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" While based on a true story, director Greenwald sidesteps many western (and Hollywood) conventions to bring one of the best westerns of the 1990's.
Suzy Amis plays Jo, a woman who is a little too trusting of some bad men. After escaping to the west and leaving her born out of wedlock son behind, she is almost raped by two soldiers. To hide from them, she wears men's clothing and scars her face, eventually using her new facade to get what she needs in the west to survive. Ian McKellen plays a woman hater who takes her in, believing she is a young man. She eventually befriends Bo Hopkins, who has his best role in years, and starts a sheep ranch. She falls in love with a Chinese man she was forced to hire as her cook, and must eventually do battle with a cattle comglomerate trying to get a foothold and driving the sheep ranchers out.
Amis resembles Eric Stoltz in her scenes as a man, and is totally believable. McKellan and Rene Auberjonois have small but pivotal roles as older father figures who Amis trusts, but eventually turn on her. Bo Hopkins is great as the neighbor Amis tolerates, befriends, and tolerates. David Chung plays the Chinese man nicknamed Tin Man as an ailing opium addicted flawed man. He looks perfect for the part, life scars and all. Heather Graham also has a small part as Amis' paramour, and does her best with it.
The most surprising aspects of this film is what the film is not. There are no cute ""Yentl"" scenes, where Amis falls in love with a man as a man. The cattle company war, a standard western plot point, never overwhelms the story, or comes to a trite conclusion. The final scenes, with Jo's unmasking, seem almost like farce, but when thought about later, play very truthfully and touchingly, especially Hopkins' reaction.
Greenwald's camera turns a small film into an epic, with gorgeous Montana scenery. Her script is also very smart, never going for cheap laughs or the kind of exploitation that a male director may have gone for. I strongly recommend ""The Ballad of Little Jo.""
This is rated (R) for physical violence, strong gun violence, some sexual violence, gore, some profanity, some female nudity, sexual content, sexual references, drug abuse, and adult situations.",1022112000,24,2369,4.72463768115942
754143,4,6303980430,"For a movie that I wasn't prepared to like, this little, unknown `ballad' turned into a treasure-trove of surprises.  Well acted throughout, ""The Ballad of Little Jo"" hits the mark at almost every turn.  The director and writer, Maggie Greenwald, brought a sense of stark realism  to the period, much like Robert Altman brought to his classic ""McCabe  and Mrs. Miller"".  This was especially true in the mining camp scenes.
This is a story of a young woman trying to make it on her own as she  travels west after an affair has brought her shame and banishment.  The  twist, of course, is that the only way she can survive and scratch an  existence is by hiding herself as a man (actually, a boy).  The classic  beauty of Suzy Amis requires one to stretch his or her imagination quite a  bit in order for this movie to work.  For instance, did I, for even one  second, think she looked like a man?  Not on your life, buster!  How about  as a young lad?  Well, not really.  So did it work?  A very surprising  YES!  And the credit has to go to Ms. Amis--she was wonderful in this  film--as well as the director.
The movie travels at a somewhat pedestrian  pace, however, it is never dull and carries a wealth of scenes that brings  out a pure and simple honesty, which is rare in filmmaking.  After viewing  this film, I wished that they had spent a little more time showing  Josephine the woman, but because of time constraints (the film was fairly  long as is), most of her past was shown only in quick flashbacks.  Between  1 and 10, ""The Ballad of Little Jo"" deserves a solid 8.  This is  one film I know I'll enjoy over and over again.  People, do yourself a  favor and rent or buy this film.  I think you'll be as pleasantly surprised  as I.",964483200,36,1744,4.35423197492163
