3499762,1,B001BX0BMC,This 19 minute program only serve to make you appreciate other WW2 documentaries.  It was made in 1942 and is almost a rah rah film for the Navy while really giving no tactical info regarding the battle.  It probably was just played in movie theaters.,1436918400,,251,4.555555555555555
3499763,5,B001BX0BMC,"After reading the book ""Five Who Came Back"" I was delighted to actually see the documentary that Wyler filmed on Midway lying on top of a building during that battle.  The actual battle scenes are the real McCoy.  If you look closely you can see the film jump when a bomb exploded nearby knocking down and out Wyler and another photographer.  However the camera kept filming.  Wyler suffered a minor injury and since they were in the army he received a Purple Heart.  Nowadays some would scoff at the presentation of the movie, but if you look at the time, people needed that kind of reassurance.  Remember that Midway was the battle our country won in the Pacific during WW2.  The first success we had after Pearl Harbor.",1427846400,,722,4.59375
3499764,3,B001BX0BMC,"Very short video.  While it has historical value for what it is, it could have just as easily been filmed on a Hollywood back lot.  I lived on Midway for a year and a half in the 60's, just 20 years after the battle and NOTHING in the video was recognizable.",1415318400,,258,4.03921568627451
3499765,3,B001BX0BMC,"Limited footage on the Battle of Midway beyond what one person experienced on the island.  Limited footage of the air or naval battle, I expected more.  On the other hand probably not meant to document what really happened which is a shame as this was such a critical battle.  Too bad Ford didn't revisit this after the war with an expanded version that could tell us more.",1408838400,,373,4.537313432835821
3499766,3,B001BX0BMC,"If you are interested enough in the WW2 subject matter to order this dvd, then you have probably seen similiar footage many times before.  It wasn't what I expected and contained repeated shots, no real discussion of the battle, no new news in this accounting of the Battle of Midway and brief coverage of 'the famlies back home'.  Not much naval action ala Victory at Sea.",1394409600,,373,4.636363636363637
3499767,4,B001BX0BMC,Ford risked his life filming much of this footage in the face of incoming Japanese strafing his position.  It is an important film to see and know about.,1360108800,,153,4.464285714285714
3499768,4,B001BX0BMC,"So this documentary was made by John Ford. The famous American film maker best known for helping to create John Wayne as the action power house that he is, along with creating the modern mythology of the American west for the better part of two decades. After the US entered World War 2, John Ford offered his services to the United States Navy and commissioned as Lt. Commander in their combat camera service. He was offered a chance to film the upcoming battle for Midway Island from the island itself as a way to prove to the American population that their Navy was doing something in trying to win the war with Japan. Soon after the battle John Ford and his camera crew were back in Pearl Harbor splicing all their combat footage together with other official Navy Documentary film from the battle and a quick narrative by Henry Fonda, Donald Crip, and Jane Darwell. This film was first shown to Nimitz and then later to President Roosevelt, before being pushed to all of the movie houses around the nation. It won the 1942 Academy Award for Documentary, and John Ford himself was injured during the filming when splinters of a bomb hit him.",1284076800,15,1144,4.612745098039215
8285052,1,B001BX0BMC,"..wasn't much to it ... about 10 minutes long, was expecting a documentary..",1510012800,,76,4.923076923076923
8285053,4,B001BX0BMC,Video included many interesting facts and details. The video is very short in length (around 18 minutes I think) which is why I gave a little lower star rating.,1483228800,,160,4.551724137931035
8285054,3,B001BX0BMC,Always wanted to see this footage. Image quality is on the poor side - but that's to be expected.,1480291200,,97,4.157894736842105
8285055,3,B001BX0BMC,"To understand and appreciate this short documentary film, you have to put your mindset into the time that it was made.  Yes, it is a U.S. government sponsored wartime propaganda piece that was meant to buck-up up the folks Stateside, glorify the men in combat and dehumanize the Japanese.  The editing is not very well done.  The dialog is pitiful.  But back in the day it served its purpose.  But forget all of that.  This review is about the video it self, not the content.  The images are not very clear, but this is old 16mm film transferred to video format so one can't expect miracles.  I love the fact that it's all in color.  All of the combat footage is real, taken during the actual battle.  Nothing was staged.  That in itself makes this a chilling time capsule of history.",1472083200,,784,4.48936170212766
8285056,5,B001BX0BMC,"A rare gem of a film made during the fighting on Midway Island during WW 2. Although it alters some facts, it is still a very engrossing film. I recommend this short (18 minutes) film for all interested in history.",1458864000,,214,4.375
8285057,1,B001BX0BMC,The documentary I got was not the John Ford film.  It was wartime film produced by US Navy cameramen with very little actual battle scenes and a lot of patriotic music.,1458777600,,168,4.419354838709677
8285058,5,B001BX0BMC,Great video of my first naval assignment.,1458172800,,41,5.0
8285059,5,B001BX0BMC,A must for all history buffs,1454025600,,28,3.8333333333333335
8285060,5,B001BX0BMC,"If the legend is correct, John Ford arrived at Midway with no knowledge whatsoever that a Japanese attack was in the offing and it would occur while he was there. Whether that is the case or not is irrelevant when considering this short (around 18 minutes long) propaganda movie. And yes, thats what it is: a propaganda movie seeking to buck up the morale of Americans. It is not a documentary trying to detail a battle. There was no time for such luxury.

The Battle of Midway took place in June 1942. Lets put that date in perspective, OK?

Its only been six months since Pearl Harbor, the fall of Hong Kong, Singapore, Wake Island and Guam.

Its only been two months since the Bataan Death March that marked the collapse of the US military in the Philippines.

And its been one month since the fall of Corregidor.

Aside for the Doolittle Raid in April and the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, theres precious little else that can be considered successful.

So, irrespective of how and why he was there, John Ford produced a film that showed the American population its military could not just fight the Japanese to a draw (the Coral Sea) but could defeat their attack and cause them to retreat.

Filmed in vivid, almost preternatural Technicolor, the film begins with scenes before the battle of sailors, marines and Army Air Force types on the island. With a shocking suddenness, the attack begins. Its so violent and shocking that, a one point, an explosion knocks the cameraman down. Ford was wounded on midway so one has to wonder if this was the moment of that wound. After the attack on the island is beaten off, we view films of the air-sea battle that finishes with a tally of the damage incurred by the enemy. Like every John Ford production, there are marvelous scenic vistas and in-motion portrats of the participants.

Enemy; that whats the Japanese were to the Americans in WW2. This was perceived as a cultural battle to the death and this propaganda movie used the documentation of the event to provide those on the home front with proof positive America would win!",1447027200,,2083,4.626016260162602
