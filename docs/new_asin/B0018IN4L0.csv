8269814,5,B0018IN4L0,"What we have here is the Jimi Hendrix Maui 1970 - Stockholm 1969 live DVD. Released on Apocalypse Sound, although its an unofficial ""fanclub"" release, it is a silver disc, not just a dvd-r. 1st on the DVD is Jimi's July 30th, 1970 show in Maui, the 2nd to last gig he ever played in the USA. This was a free outdoor gig filmed for a horrible hippie-dippy movie called Rainbow Bridge. There was only 17 minutes of footage used in the movie, this DVD gives us all of the known footage filmed at the show. Whatever they used for a master source must've been close to the original tapes as the quality, both audio and video, is excellent given the limitations of the time and setting. Jimi played a great show that day and any Hendrix fan absolutely must have a copy of this. Killer set list too. The entire gig wasn't filmed but we get 13 songs. The parts of the songs that weren't caught on film are filled in with shots of the 450 or so hippies in attendance.
The other show on here is from Stockholm, Jan 9th, 1969. The Experience played two shows that date. This is the early show, filmed for Swedish television in black & white. Again, taken from a very low-gen source, excellent quality. Unfortunately this is widely considered the worst show by Jimi ever filmed. No one knows what was wrong with him that day but he had a waaayyyy off night. However, I think even Hendrix having an off night is worth having just for historical value. The late show was much much better (legend has it Noel Redding scored some ""goodies"" between the two sets that perked Jimi right up), but unfortunately the film crew had gone home for the evening. Two songs from this show were officially released as bonus tracks on the Experience DVD and there's an unofficial double live album, Stockholm Concert, with both sets on it.",1421020800,,1809,4.468277945619335

8269816,4,B0018IN4L0,"The 1970 show appears to be taken directly from the film RAINBOW BRIDGE. Someone jump in, with the answer, thank you.
Some excellent music, esp. DOLLY DAGGER, VOODOO CHILD, PURPLE HAZE, survive a lot of incongruous documentary and movie effects, i.e. the fore mentioned cult favorite and the ultimate cult rage, EASY RIDER. If you want the raw concert footage, better look elsewhere. (Hendrix experts, please advise).
Kudos to the original concert technical director, who manages to get in a lot of nice ""live"" footage, incl. cool cutaways to the hippiest attendees, west of the west coast.
The 1969 footage appearso to be the familiar (I guess, to youtube fans) Stockholm experience, much less ""theatric"" than the Maui show, as it features a group which, according to JH, hasn't played together in six weeks, and seems to have forgotten what levels are to be set on the speakers. It also appears that Hendrix didn't tune his guitar, so we assume that there were no *rehearsals* either, in that stretch of time. But FIRE, VOODOO CHILD, and SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE sounded good enough to commit to disc.
The '69 segment appears to be shot from two cameras, stage right; and in black and white.",1377820800,4,1190,4.838235294117647
