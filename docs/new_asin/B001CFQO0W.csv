8338341,5,B001CFQO0W,"Once again a great collection of episodes, you have more interaction with Yuri and his brother Shori. I love this entire series and am so happy that it has been picked up and revived so we get to see all of the episodes dubbed into English. I've already seen the original episodes in Japanese but this is so much better. For any anime fan then Kyo Kara Maoh is definitely one that's top of my list, you won't be disappointed. It's infuriating to only get 4 episodes per disc and does work out to be so expensive, for those that don't have too much money you would probably be better off waiting for the boxed set but that would probably be next year.",1222128000,,650,4.2926829268292686
8338342,5,B001CFQO0W,Love this series. It's full of humor. Animation is great.  Well done. Totally enjoyed it. Would recommend to any anime fans.  Waiting impatiently for volume 9.,1217289600,2,159,5.076923076923077
