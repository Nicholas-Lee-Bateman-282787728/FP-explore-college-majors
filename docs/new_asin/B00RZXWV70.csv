8696575,2,B00RZXWV70,"This movie begins showing a woman named Delilah doing a ritual in her apartment room that results in smoke coming from the door and raising suspicions.  During the ritual her voice changes into a demon.  An old man is playing a card game outside.  When Delilah hands him a horn ornament she's awarded a trip through a cave with skulls on the walls.  When she leaves the man won't let her exit through the gate.  He punches her and knocks her down as he handcuffs her to a pole. He has his way with her.  She doesn't seem upset about this.

Before leaving he leaves Delilah hanging and throws rock salt on the ground.  When a guy named Chambers went to the Oracle he was told how he would die.  He said two children born together from the same seed will be put to rest from moral flesh.  Centuries later the prophecy has never been fulfilled.  To cheat fate Chambers sentences all his twins to death the moment they were born.  But when the babies was born the midwives took pity on them.

His only chance was a trick.  One midwife would return to Chambers with the Delilah and pretend the narrator (Blue) was never born.  Delilah would tell Blue she'd kill Chambers but for him to believe her she'd have to offer proof.  So while mom and Blue escaped the sister returned in one arm, and his sister Delilah went with her own sister in the other arm.  Blue visits a fortune teller.  He won't spill the beans concerning his brother when it's brought to his attention.  He won't say anything about a girl who died either.  The fortune teller suddenly grabs a gun and says ""Get out!""  He must've seen a horrific image.

Suddenly Blue breaks in through the window and stabs the fortune teller while he's busy with a pregnant client (Delilah).  She opens the front door for Blue and she smiles back.  They were in this together.  She hands Blue a book about tracking down their brothers and sisters.  Delilah studied the dark arts of Chambers.  She grabs Blue and pulls him away.  She throws a woman to the ground and the woman smiles that she will taste something, and will tell Delilah what she needs to know.  Delilah rips her tooth out.

Mother told Blue about Delilah the first time.  The next day Delilah shows up at the fortune teller's door saying she ran away from Chambers.  He thinks she's a spy but the mother says they can trust her.  All these years Chambers has finally found them and that's why mother was sick.  The fortune teller says he can't kill Chambers on her own.  He needed Delilah to do it.  The fortune teller keeps her mother's picture because her work was important.  Delilah smacks both the fortune teller and the woman who was laughing on the floor.  Now Delilah is walking around outside while loud female opera music plays.  Delilah asks her brother to hold up a purple cloth.  This allows a door to open.

Delilah sees weird puppets when she steps inside.  She picks up a brick ready to smack someone.  A monster reaches down and picks her up by the throat.  It then punches her out.  Outside Blue walks inside the building and bashes the dolls.  He walks upstairs and beats the monster with a brick.  He saves his sister Delilah, and she says to get the horn.  Blue recommends some out fashioned detective work.  Who's more likely to know who Chambers is than the man who holds his purse strings.  Blue recommends going by Chamber's office and asking some questions.  Blue finds Chambers apartment.  Chambers says he's interested in Blue's proposal.  Blue says he has acres of land in Oklahoma.  Chambers says he was under the impression it was Native American territory.  The Native Americans consider it a spiritual hotbed.  He asks Chambers if he has any clients who'd be interested in obtaining this Oklahoma land.

Chambers mentions holy scriptures made by Monks attached to the walls of his office room.  He shows Blue the sword used one time by an emperor in a war.  It was a military debacle in history.  The few remaining soldiers impaled the leader with his own sword.  He shows Blue his prized possession.  A mirror or rather, the glass of Narcissist.  Chambers asks Blue if he's aware of Oklahoma and the secret in the forest.  Blue and Chambers are now in the mirror standing on Oklahoma soil.  Chambers stabs Blue.  Delilah walks in and wakes up her brother.  Chambers is gone.  Delilah and Blue go to bed (in separate beds).  Delilah meets up with the receptionist lady from Chambers office on a subway ride.  Delilah takes out a paper and the woman rubs her hands on the writing of the pages.

Delilah cuts a piece of hair from her brother's head.  She needs a sample for protection.  Blue wakes up refreshed.  Delilah says she had a vision last night and they need to split up.  He reminds her the only reason they're still alive is because they stayed together.  Blue hands her a horn which works as a perfect compass when one is lost.  Blue spins the horn like he's playing spin the bottle and sees his small Oklahoma town on the paper where the horn lands.  Blue says it took them their whole lives to find each other and Delilah says fate will bring them back together.

Delilah visits Paris and speaks French to some guy.  I can't understand what's being said.  The man started speaking in English but Delilah insists on speaking French.  The man hugs and kisses her romantically.  Blue returns to Oklahoma to hitchhike.  We hear female opera as Blue sees maggots crawling on dead cattle and mammatus clouds.  Careful knocking on the front door is required with a yellow jacket hive on it.  Blue walks to the attic and sees pictures of a woman hanging on the wall.  Chambers appears and wrestles Blue, then wrestles him some more outside in the forest.  Blue jumps across the forest with a knife in his hand, but Chambers grabs his face.  Blue stabs Chamber and he coughs up milk.

Blue asks Delilah to help him but she's a couple miles away... in France!  She enters an art museum and shows a man a rock.  He dips the rock in fluid and shows her a map and a compass.  Delilah visits an old castle.  She meets a man having tea at a table.  He looks like an older version of Michael Douglas.  He certainly doesn't speak like Michael Douglas!  He laughs hard and points his finger at Delilah.  Did the producers intend this movie for those who speak both French and English?  Because I can only speak one of those languages.

The man is exhausting Delilah.  She rests her pretty head down after a while.  You can only handle so much finger pointing.  She gets drunk and gulps the wine down hard as an alarm clock goes off and the French man laughs hard.  He laughs so hard she falls over.  She struggles to walk down the path but she manages to leave.  Back in the farmlands of Oklahoma, Blue has flashbacks of the bees and Chambers amazing slashing abilities.

Just because Blue's in Oklahoma doesn't mean he's speaking English.  Don't be foolish and think that!  The Native American sings to Blue as he watches their tribal dance outside.  Blue participates but I don't think he's being enlightened by something he can't understand being white and all.  Blue walks down the woods and has to contend with a karate ninja jumping down from the trees and doing amazing jump kicks!  The ninja jumps out of the dirt for the ultimate sneak attack.  Blue beats them all to death and they disappear.  You must rest now my warrior!

Blue runs shirtless through fields until he arrives to a shovel in a field.  He digs a hole right where the shovel stands.  He opens a casket lid and jumps in.  A few talking flower men asks Blue to speak and he says he's a son of Chambers.  The flower men say Chambers was to live forever and Blue must restore order.  The replies from each flower man happen one after another really quickly.  Blue finds himself at the Native American tribal dance.

Blue meets up with Delilah.  He says he found what he needs to kill Chambers.  She asks Blue if he can kill their father.  He remembers his childhood going from one reservation to the next.  He knew it would come down to this.  Chambers isn't that important to Blue but to Delilah he's a father.  Blue asks Delilah if she can kill him if she had to.  Her reply is ""I know where to find him"".

Delilah dresses as Little Red Riding Hood as the two walk through the woods.  Blue says there's something out there and he will be right back.  Delilah sees a figure dressed in a purple cloak and points Blue in the right direction.  Suddenly Delilah moves faster and when she turns around to look at Blue after he complains he can't keep up, she doesn't have the same face she did a moment ago.  Blue finds himself in Chambers cult dungeon.  Chambers says it's awesome to reach the pinnacle of his existence.  Chambers says Blue is the only son that matters.  He says ""You're angry at your sister because she betrayed you.  We all wasted our lives consumed by your appetite.  They are here to put their father's moral flesh to rest.  The man who fulfills his destiny is a hero.  The man who defeats his destiny becomes a God"".

Blue says he's not here for the prophecy or to put his father to rest.  He's here because Chambers killed his mother and Blue swore he'd hunt him down and kill him for it.  Chambers says he named Blue after a River of Woe that cuts across the underworld and divides the living from the dead.  His true name is Karen-  this name will carry the father into forever.  Blue and Delilah hold knives up to each other's throats.  The father yells that he is Chambers during the ritual introduction.  Yeah we kinda knew that already.  He puts infant hair in a pot of stew he's making.  He puts flesh of an immortal in the stew as well- it's a hot female leg.  When the father drinks the stew his face begins to burn.  He says ""You're not my son"" and Blue charges at him with a sword.  Delilah stabs him in the back with a sword but the father is strong and continues trying to attack Blue.  Delilah stays on him and pushes the sword into his chest.  He dies theatrically.  Blue sees his mother.  She takes his hand and they walk a few feet away so she can turn and hug him.  She walks backwards and goes into the darkness.

The Little Red Riding Hood cloaked sisters place flowers on a blanket in a forest as Blue chops wood.  Blue says Delilah and Angelica are twins, but the prophecy never spoke of them.  Delilah was born at the same time as Angelica.  Blue and Delilah are biological twins, but she and Angelica are astrological twins.  Chambers raised the two of them together as high priestesses in preparation for this day.  Chambers had to believe it was Blue who was destined to kill him or Chambers would've seen the truth.  It was mother who convinced Delilah to take this course.

Blue says he knows nothing and thinks it's better that way.  I couldn't agree more.  The less I know about this confusing movie given I can't understand a single thing that happened, the better off I am.  I can't quite treat this movie as a mockery since there's a genuine attempt for the brother and sister to figure out their past but it's all told so confusingly.  The acting's good at least, and I'm sure there *is* a group of people out there who can actually understand the events taking place but I'm not one of them.  Blue, Delilah and the receptionist at the desk all watch a fire burn as the movie ends.",1500681600,,11344,4.4608993157380255
8696576,2,B00RZXWV70,"I rated this movie a 2 because the DVD info specifies that English is the language that is spoken, and it is maybe 70% of the time. You might want to brush up on your French and some Native American languages.",1444521600,,209,4.121951219512195
8696577,4,B00RZXWV70,"Banks and Pehme's story is a multi-layered, elevated adventure saga with heavy dramatic character building and globetrotting stripped-down action sequences. The writing is mature, well thought out, wonderfully delivered by an eclectic and impressive cast. The action scenes do drop the momentum of ""Nothing Sacred"" a bit. The fighting and choreography are decent but they don't have an energetic atmosphere resting over them to really give us that intended impact. Still they are just as well thought out, and maturing approached as the writing and dramatic sequences. The really impressive aspect of ""Nothing Sacred"" is the international flavor that it offers, as scenes are set in various locations around the world allowing for this occult themed saga to really develop into the expansive narrative that it is. Plus it is multilingual, with perfectly executed French, First Nations People's Musgokee. The vast majority is in English so don't be intimidated.

The special effects are a blend of practical effects, make-up, and Syfy/British level television CGI. Against the more stripped down scenes with mundane background these effects do seem somewhat out-of-place at times, and feel a bit cheap. Not always and when they do work they work pretty dang well. The attitude and girth of story and material that Banks and Pehme go for with ""Nothing Sacred"" is the real special effect attribute, it is nothing less than impressive, and note worthy. The soundtrack is typical fantasy, action stuff that although complimentary to the film, doesn't really stand out as anything monumental. Overall ""Nothing Sacred"" is a nice indie supernatural fantasy film that has some really good moments. There is equal bad in the film, but on the whole this is a cool, in depth saga with international flare that should be checked out by fans of indie world cinema fans.  - See more at: http://asouthernlifeinscandaloustimes.blogspot.com/2015/09/my-review-of-nothing-sacred.html#sthash.pcOQ6dj0.dpuf",1442448000,3,1984,5.5230263157894735

8696579,1,B00RZXWV70,"There is a possibility the film would qualify as ok, if you could have understood more than half of it.  Nothing like a movie that almost half is in another language - AND NO SUBTITLES!  Would have been nice to know in advance - so I wouldn't have wasted my time and money.",1429920000,2,273,4.132075471698113
