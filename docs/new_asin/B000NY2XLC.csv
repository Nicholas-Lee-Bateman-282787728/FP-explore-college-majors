Willie George played bill Gunter in a monthly video series. The movies were like an ending I believe to the series.

Good movie shot on location in dry gulch, ok. These are out on DVD now as well. This is the sane church who did fire by nite, gospel bill and adventures at dry gulch.",1309305600,2,446,4.186046511627907
8182366,1,B000NY2XLC,"Another one of Kenneth Copelands vanity projects where he gets to strut around dressed as a cowboy and play the hero as extras who get paid scale look on and try not to laugh. The point of this debacle, presumably, is to provide some type of edification through a hopelessly outdated style of film...the serial western, but who knows. I get the feeling that good old Ken just sort of felt like playing cowboy for a few days. This would be fine if it wasn't financed by the social security checks of poverty stricken widows and dying cancer patients.
