8512651,5,B0079C7E4C,Fingers crossed it will be available for purchase this was my favorite season of underbelly it was a binge watch for me and I watched it over and over again,1526083200,,156,4.233333333333333
8512652,1,B0079C7E4C,It said it would play on North American Bluray players but when I loaded all I got was a message that the format was incorrect.  Hopefully this will come out on Amazon video later.,1488499200,,180,4.294117647058823
8512653,5,B0079C7E4C,All the underbelly's are great,1444348800,,30,5.2
8512654,3,B0079C7E4C,"The first disc was defective and had screen freeze. It was ""new"" product. This was rather disappointing given the price.",1361404800,,120,5.05
8512655,4,B0079C7E4C,I would have given it a five but it has not been released in the US. I have seen it & it is a very good series. I bought the trilogy series & would buy the complete underbelly series if it was region 1 for US release.,1353110400,,217,3.6382978723404253
8512656,5,B0079C7E4C,"Watched with friends over the course of 2-sittings.

The prior 3 installments in this fantastic series were all well done and ""Razor"" didn't disappoint.  The ""razor"" gained prominence as a weapon of choice during this time period, as guns were both costly and offered extensive prison terms if arrested in possession.  This is also unique in that females were the major crime bosses.  The brothel owner versus the bootlegger.  The format is reminiscent of the prior Underbelly series.  There are frequent dramatic pauses w/monologues where characters come and go.

I think that what makes all the Underbelly Series work is in dispelling both the concept of ""the criminal mastermind"" and equally ""efficient law enforcement""

The entire Underbelly Series (including ""The Long Green Cloud - NZ"") should be on everyone's collective short lists of programming to have available for an EOTWAWKI ""bug out"" shelter!

TIP: Don't wait for and/or pay usurious prices for zone 1 formatted product.  Amazon offers region free DVD players for as low as $40, which will more than pay for themselves (I have one on every TV that I currently use to watch videos).",1334534400,6,1146,5.080213903743315
8512657,5,B0079C7E4C,"My first exposure to this absolutely top drawer crime series was the release of the ""Underbelly Trilogy""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underbelly-The-Trilogy/dp/B005MTHRDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underbelly - The Trilogy</a>&nbsp;in U.S. Region 1 format a few months ago
that resulted in a DVD watching marathon that lasted a week and resulted with my co-workers
trying to decipher my unwitting ""Aussie""isms for the following month. Now being thoroughly
hooked, I have been unsuccessfully attempting to find a release date for ""Razor"" or ""NZ"" in a
Region 1 format; anybody have a clue? I prefer not to set a rating without viewing the series,
but if it is one-tenth as well made as the original 5 stars would not be enough.",1330300800,,765,5.839285714285714
8512658,5,B0079C7E4C,"The fourth installment of the ""Underbelly"" franchise, ""Razor"", takes the viewer back to the infancy of organised crime in Sydney, with a focus on bitter rivals Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine, and their illegal enterprises from 1927 to 1936.

The costume and set design was perhaps the most challenging of all the series to date, yet this was achieved with convincing authenticity.

There are numerous historical extracts woven into the story, which includes: strict gun laws, loopholes in drug laws that allowed dentists to legally purchase cocaine, the rise of the New Guard, exploits of Francis de Groot, insight into the career of one of Australia's first policewomen Lillian May Armfield, and numerous turf wars between Leigh and Devine.

It is pleasing that ""Underbelly"" continues to give Australian actors an opportunity to showcase their talents, and is providing viewers with enthralling television drama.
