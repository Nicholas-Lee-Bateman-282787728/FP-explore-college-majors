8666128,5,B00LIDEW5M,"I'm really happy with the movie, image quality is amazing, I remember seeing this movie as a SD cable quality, the blu ray quality let me appreciate more details that I missed back them. It was a good amount of extras too, it is worth it. Very happy!",1440633600,,250,4.229166666666667

8666131,5,B00LIDEW5M,"After being so disappointed that I missed the opportunity to get Christine on blu-ray when Twilight Time released it in a limited edition last year.  With the price tag at about $170 for that version now, I just can't pay that much for it.  I was so surprised to run across this edition from Germany.  I got it in the mail today, and boy was I surprised.  This is a Region Free release, and plays perfectly on my PS4.  Now what was I surprised at????  The $17 price tag??? no I was surprised to find that this release is actually much better than the Twilight Time release.  The picture is a big improvement over the DVD release, and the sound is incredible for such an old movie.  Now for what I was surprised at.  All of the special features from the previous DVD release are included on this blu-ray.  That includes the commentary, deleted scenes, and three featurettes that total almost an hour.  So the bottom line is, if you missed the Twilight Time release, do NOT pay the outrageous price for it.  Grab this German version for a small fraction of that inflated price.  I also managed to receive it from Germany within 2 weeks.",1431388800,7,1134,4.446601941747573
