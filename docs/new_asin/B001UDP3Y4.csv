3797976,3,B001UDP3Y4,"I rate this about at the middle of the road level. The acting is bad and the story is simple. The only thing that saved it, if you are a fan of gore it had a few gory scenes. Overall I wouldn't want to see it again.",1264809600,3,215,3.595744680851064
3797977,5,B001UDP3Y4,"I have no idea why some people didn't like this movie. I thought it was very good. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very well done movie, and very unique. I have never seen another movie like it. Very pleased to own this movie",1263081600,3,236,3.9375
3797978,1,B001UDP3Y4,"There are so many terrible horror films being put on the shelves each day - this is one of the ilk.  A complete worthless film, that lacks entertainment value - well I was going to list what it lacks, but it lacks everything, so I will save you the time.  Bad actors, a weak and recycled to hell plot, weak effects... in fact there is nothing worth mentioning - Simply put - don't waste you time.",1256947200,5,396,4.197368421052632
3797979,1,B001UDP3Y4,"My title says it all.  I did not care for any of the characters in this movie (the over-sexed couple, the cheating boyfriend with the side girlfriend pregnant, the too stupid to know girlfriend, and the nice guy).  The gory parts were over done.  You could see the killers from miles away (the old woman with the bad teeth and the killer who looked like any hillbilly, who was probably the only likable person).  You get to know what was the main ingredient in the food the old woman made.  There was nothing humorous in this film.  This film was just so unbelievable.

There wasn't much of a story line and really after the first 1/2 hour you don't care.  It's a shame because horror movies coming out of the UK were starting to get good.  This one sets British films back.",1255996800,6,774,4.394366197183099
8343327,3,B001UDP3Y4,"I liked this one, actually. Parts of it were too cliched, but it was plenty creepy and made me glad I no longer eat meat pies.",1520899200,,126,3.8846153846153846
8343328,3,B001UDP3Y4,"It was pretty good. A little boring at times. But how stupid the characters are is a bit ridiculous hahaha. Like come on! Common sense people, they asked to get killed basically!",1519171200,,178,4.59375
8343329,5,B001UDP3Y4,decent TV dinner movie. highly recommend dessert while watching.  scrapple is the dessert of MEATS!,1513987200,,99,5.6
8343330,3,B001UDP3Y4,good service OK video,1512950400,,21,4.5
8343331,1,B001UDP3Y4,"I thought we were done making horror movies where the characters only have one brain cell between them all. Boring, unoriginal, the characters could have killed the cannibal many times but chose not to. in fact, sometimes they ran towards him defenseless instead. The kills sucked and there was no story.",1509840000,3,304,4.980392156862745
8343332,3,B001UDP3Y4,"In that it wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good. I mean, the premise has been done better other places, but this was an alright representation. That said, it didn't really impress any changes on the format of ""the meat is people,"" so I can't be that excited about it.",1509408000,,266,4.34
8343333,5,B001UDP3Y4,Perfect horror movie loved it who knew England is so beautiful with a dark secret. If u don't like blood and guts then this is not the movie for u if u are the exact opposite like me then this is right up your alley!,1508803200,,216,3.8222222222222224
8343334,2,B001UDP3Y4,"I guess I might give closer to 2.5, but I'm rounding down on this one because it was super formulaic...  If you can't tell from the description this is essentially Friday the 13th meets Sweeny Todd...

Gore scenes were decent...  few moderate jump scenes...  cinematography was good ( only 1 or 2 really dark scenes )...  sound quality was fine...

The big downfall in this movie is not was mentioned above...  it's just that the script was bad.  and I couldn't tell if the actors were bad, or just having to follow a dumb script ( i'm leaning towards the later )...  I really am getting sick of the ""I'm too stupid to survive pretty much anything"" characters in movies...  Not once, not twice, not even 3 times, but more like 4+ times was the ""villain"" knocked down or stabbed and instead of doing anything useful, the characters just run away screaming with their hands in the air...

Literally...  if I see a friend, tied down on a butcher block, and I see a guy with a big knife about to cut him open...  and I manage to wack him over the head with a baseball bat...  bad guy drops to the floor...  do I...

1 - keep hitting him until his head is pulp?
2 - kick him again and try to untie my friend?
3 - drop the bat and run with arms up high and screaming for the door?

Even the one time a ""protagonist"" picks up a seriously lethal weapon...  he just kind of stands there with it frozen...  and waits to get punched and be disarmed...

I don't think any of the characters in this movie could survive a fight with a kindergartner...  thus 2 stars it is...

If you are bored, and want to watch a slasher flick...  go for it...  It wasn't ""awful awful""...",1506643200,,1658,4.257234726688103
8343335,3,B001UDP3Y4,Not bad. I've seen much worst.,1506124800,,30,4.166666666666667
8343336,4,B001UDP3Y4,"I liked it.  Cool little flick from across the pond.  Very dark, dreary, nasty, ugly, gritty, precisely what you look for in a movie like this.  I think they did a good job.",1452297600,2,173,4.181818181818182
