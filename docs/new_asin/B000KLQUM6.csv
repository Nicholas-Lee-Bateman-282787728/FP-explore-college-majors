2694195,4,B000KLQUM6,"I love these actresses and the supporting cast is terrific.  But as the series progressed, it just got a little too absurd.  There seems to be a trend now that every series has to pile outrageous plot twist upon twist rather than stay true to some type of natural order.  The concept of looking at women of a certain age and the family entanglements, loss of relevance and other struggles they face is enough to fill out a satisfying story line and I wish the writers had left the dark and often farcical elements out of the story.  I will still take a look at the next season, based on the strength of all the actors involved, but I hope they get the story back on the rails quickly.",1520467200,,684,4.27906976744186
2694196,5,B000KLQUM6,"Great show, I can relate not the murder of course but Gail's mother omg so funny. Finally a show not about 30 somethings looking for love. Can't wait for more.",1520208000,,159,4.333333333333333
2694197,2,B000KLQUM6,"A great cast of three wonderful actresses and good supporting cast (two stars for those reasons) wasted on story lines that could be executed so much more intelligently.  Started with a good premise in episode 1 but went downhill from there.  The writers have turned these three women into stereo-typical brainless twits ""of a certain age"".  How sad for the actresses and for us.  You'll watch thinking ""no one could be that stupid"".  What a sad misuse of talent.",1520208000,,463,4.810126582278481
2694198,4,B000KLQUM6,"Three wonderful actresses, Phyllis Logan, Mirandas Richardson and Zoe Wanamaker are three women, best girlfriends for many years. In this Acorn TV series, with 6 episodes, we become privy to the problems in all of their lives, and learn how they support each other.

Logans character is on a cruise with her husband when something untoward occurs with him. Miranda and her live in boyfriend work together, and they have some big difficulties and things fall apart. Wanamaker is separated from her husband, lives with her son who is just out of jail and a mother with dementia. If this was not enough, more problems, childrens issues and strange occurrences develop.

This series was well done until episode three when the writers throw in the most ridiculous plot line, and all goes downhill from there. This is not a realistic plot, not is it even reasonable or entertaining.

I don't watch TV much but something about series with older leading women is comforting, I think it reminds me of when I was little and used to watch Murder She Wrote (which I love to death) with my grandmother.

2694219,3,B000KLQUM6,"EDIT:  While I do still like the show and will watch the next episode, it is turning more and more from older, strong women who have persevered and the strength of their friendship to The Three Stooges, and don't get me wrong, Stooges are great...but not in this show.

The actresses are top notch.  I BLAME THE SCRIPT AND THE DIRECTOR.  WAKE UP before you lose us.  You don't need to make the plot more and more far fetched to keep us watching.  Make the characters stronger and more plausible like I saw the potential for in the beginning episodes.

You're going off the rails and THAT would be a shame.  THERE ARE NO SERIES about women in their fifties and all they have lived through and how important friendships are.

I am worried if this show keeps going in the implausible way it's going, there won't be.  Stop making them three female Stooges because it's not funny.

The story lines are just as powerful, the characters just as lovable and unpredictable and the skits hilariously funny.
I am a fan of Joan who is now a star in ABC hit show Black-ish but this is by far my favorite portrayal of her as neurotic, annoying, sweet and extremely lovable Joan Clayton; and Toni Childs the most selfish yet somehow enjoyable characters, Maya; straight up ghetto fabulous, and Lynn who keeps us engrossed even as she does not have an idea what the hell she is doing.

2694331,4,B000KLQUM6,"The infusion of REALITY TV into our lives has forced me to watch DVDs at night.  Out of choices, i decided to watch Girlfriends.  I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the show.  The writing is really good, but what sold me on the show was TONI.  TONI is self absorbed but she is clearly the personality of the show.

This season, I did not like Joan talking in that bubble; Joan's over the top personality and the bad weaves.  Maya and Toni's weaves were horrible.  Also, in the opening scenes they are wearing these outdated red, white and blue jean outfits.  Maya actually has on some red leather pants.  I am glad they finally got rid of those outfits after season 2.

Personally, I think Lynne should have not been included on the show or written better.  In this season, she really has no purpose and they claim Joan has been supporting her for 8 years.  Joan is about 27-29 and has been in school for most of those years.  It is not believeable that she supported Lynne for the last eight years.

Maya is ghetto, but believeable.  What is NOT believeable is that she spends NO time with her husband and child; this is corrected in later seasons though.

The character I hate yet most relate to is Joan, with her overanalyzing and anal self.",1306108800,,1249,4.436123348017621

2694334,5,B000KLQUM6,"I was curious to see this show because Kelsey Grammar is the executive producer of it.

I took a chance and bought this set sight unseen.  Money well spent!  Every episode was very funny start to finish!  Season One is great!  I highly recommend it.

The characters ""Maya"", ""Toni"" and ""William"" are the three best characters in the show.  All three are consistently funny.  I love the fact Toni could never remember Jabari's real name.  (""Did Jacuzzi change his name?"" LOL)

Now the bad news... based on the merits of Season One, I bought the remaining five seasons.  That was a BIG mistake.  ""Girlfriends"" followed the same path as ""MASH"".... it went from comedy to drama... but in a shorter time span.  Some episodes were so dramatic that they were absolutely painful to watch.  The characters ""Joan"" and ""Lynn"" are both AWFUL.  Joan is so neurotic and unattractive (i.e. Rosanna Rosanadanna hairdo, BIG eyes and nose) it is not funny.  Lynn is an unfunny, selfish, inconsiderate, lazy parasite who avoids work and grown up responsibilities.  ""Girlfriends"" would have been a much better show if Joan and Lynn were written off in the first season and the show remained a comedy.",1241827200,,1179,4.815
2694335,5,B000KLQUM6,"Ever since this show premiered when I was in high school (I believe I was around 15 years old), I fell in love with it. It was hilarious, witty, and showed women, not just Black women, but women in general, taking care of themselves and also explored the dynamic of their relationship.  I could not get enough.  Then it was cancelled unexpectedly and I literally took it very hard but recently, I was searching on the internet and found that there are DVDs! WOOOOOOO!  I must say the first season was an excellent one because we were introduced to these characters and its just a reminder of how their characters evolved over time.  Amazing.

I love season 1 because of the whole tension between Davis and Joan, Mya's rough around the edges approach, Lynn's bohemian style, and Toni's materialism.  It just goes to show that even the most established and successful people are still insecure and looking for more than what they already possess.

I look forward to purchasing other seasons.

Btw, if i were to pick which characters I am, I would say a cross between Joan and Lynn. lol

ENJOY!",1235347200,,1091,4.640625

From the staunch character played by Ms Tracee Ellis Ross to the modern day free spirit Persia White.  Affluent African Americans portrayed as never before in a natural and real-life setting.  I applaud producer Kelsey Grammer of Cheers, and Frasier fame for a good script, well developed characters and just enough modern day problems and situations to make this show worth taking a look at.  The actresses and actors are well known within the African American community and accomplished in their own right.  Basically you have a sitcom that follows traditional lines but with a hint of Ebonics thrown in to be enjoyable to all.  The women are beautiful and strong American women and the fine portrayal of an affluent African American man by actors such as Reggie Hayes is a welcome treat for viewers like myself who are so tired of seeing African Americans portrayed as pimps and hookers.  Great work from a great cast and again good stuff Mr Grammer, one of the funniest men on TV today.",1214352000,2,1268,5.505154639175258

I like that the women are professional, classy and portrayed in a postive light (Well, Lynn is debatable.  She's a little too unfocused and ""free"" for my taste).  I also like that the men they date are MEN and not boys in grown men's bodies like a lot of sitcoms these days.  Girlfriends explores topics relevant to today such as sexuality, economic empowerment, politics, marriage and dating. And even though these are 4 black women, I know women of all races can relate to what these characters experience.  Girlfriends cares about telling great stories and don't always go for the laughs (although there are plenty of those).  It is just excellent writing and in the end we can't ask for more than that.",1179878400,3,858,4.718120805369128

2694394,4,B000KLQUM6,"For years now I've been out of touch with the ""Girlfriends"" TV show. For one, they kept moving it from Monday to some other day, then from one time to another, so I'd never know when to set the VCR. Whenever I could finally catch it, I'd never know what was going on, since ""Girlfriends"", like another show I'd like to see, ""Providence"", was serial in nature, in that it had a running story line. I finally gave up trying to watch it on TV, in fact, I've given up watching TV, period. However, I never really gave up wanting to just start over with the show, either through syndication or other means. I'm very happy then, that the DVD of the first season of ""Girlfriends"" is here at last.

I've just finished the first season through the four DVDs sent to me by Netflix rental. It left with quite the cliffhanger, giving me the feeling that things aren't going to be quite the same between the four women from here out. The writing for this show is great. It's about the lives of four black women of varying socioeconomic and marital status who have managed to forge a great relationship with each other: Attorney Joan, her best friend from childhood, Toni; their friend from college, Lynn; Joan's secretary Maya, and Joan's colleague William is there to offer the male perspective.

Tracee Ellis Ross, as Joan, is a fantastic comic actress; I love those segments where she thinks out loud to the audience! That she's the daughter of a show business legend makes for a good Jeopardy question, however the younger Ms. Ross has carved out a niche of her own as one of the new queens of comedy! And don't we all know people like Joan, the peacemaker who's always trying to fix someone's problems, with the best of intentions. Golden Brooks, as Maya, is a beautiful actress who gives her character a spiritual groundedness as the thus-far only married character. Maya may be lower on the totem pole socially than her boss and Toni, but she brings to the table a pride and intelligence that's not often considered from a secretary, and I like that about this character. On the other hand, Jill Marie Jones' Toni Childs brings all sorts of issues to the table, from skin color to the fact that the way to her heart is through her wallet; and haven't we all known, either personally or otherwise, someone whose sheer gall gets them into trouble and whom we feel obligated to rescue because we've know them so long? Persia White plays the striking young drifter who can't seem to reconcile with life outside of college. Lynn seems to be the flower child who is a couple of decades too late.

I wish I had a posse like this...without the drama, of course! Seriously, the writers have created four very believable women and put them in very believable situations, some of which are very serious, and still there's room for humor. I don't think there's another show like it, and it doesn't hurt that the executive producer of the show is Frasier's Kelsey Grammar.

""Girlfriends"" is the best thing to happen to network television, and I hope this is the first of all seven seasons to be released to disc. It will be interesting to see how the show and the characters evolve from here. One thing I would like to see on future sets, is some commentary, either from the main actors or the guest artists or the director of each show. Don't just put the shows on and that's that; this is the only thing that was disappointing There should be extras for a show like this. Surely there were outtakes and other things that didn't make it to broadcast. I would have liked to have seen something on how ""Girlfriends"" came into being in the first place. This would have been good for a first DVD, but since we didn't get that I'm hoping subsequent releases will be more interesting.",1177200000,15,3760,4.549483013293944

I will pre-order each one if needed... I've been posting the link for others to buy on every web site I own to include my My Space page trying to encourage more buyers for season 1... The reason why it took so long for this season to come out on DVD is because it's a more popular African American show...  The company felt that the viewing audience wouldn't buy the DVD because Season 1 of Soul Food did so bad... That's why Season 2 of Soul Food never came out...  Please encourage more buyers to purchase Season 1 of Girlfriends so the other Seasons can come to DVD... I missed the shows because of Iraq... I've been deployed 4 times and I really need to get caught up...  Due to Iraqi Freedom I missed Toni leaving and I'd like to know why she left...

I find myself laughing most of the way through this as it's got a great humour to it.  My favourite character is Mya, William and Joan and in fact all of the girls have very different personalities and screen presence.
As the theme to Girlfriends goes, these girls are there for each other through thick and thin and everything.  They have laughs, argue but all in all, genuinely care for each other and get along together.  They help each other get through their relationship problems and even have shared some of the same guys.  Joan is the smart one, Toni is the wanna-be-rich one, Mya is the sassy one and Lynn is the hippie one.  I love the blend in personalities and love this light hearted fluff.  It's great.

I knew Kelsey Grammer was a winner when I watched his show Frazier (another good sitcom) and I am pleased with his job as producer of an all black show. He has done an excellent job of portraying black women in a positive light which isn't always the case in Hollywood.  Go Tracee, Golden, Persia, Jill Marie, and Reggie!

I knew the Soul Food series was already on DVD, however I knew Girlfriends was not.  I purchased the Soul Food series yesterday and wondered to myself when was Girlfriends going to be on DVD.  So it is to my surprise that decided to look on the Amazon website today and saw that Girlfriends is finally out on DVD.  Yeah!!!!!",1169942400,,420,4.346153846153846

I hope they come out with the next 6 years really quickly!!! Love the girls ( and William) and love the show, no matter what changes it goes through. THANK YOU!!!!",1169510400,,308,4.421052631578948

2694533,5,B000KLQUM6,"This has been my favorite show since day one! I am sooooooooo elated that it's on DVD! I hope we don't have to wait another 6 years for the other seasons! I must have all of these in my collection! I too, used to tape every single episode, but stopped after a while because VHS is so outdated. But, I really am excited about this. Way to go!!!!!!!!!",1168300800,,349,4.147058823529412
2694534,5,B000KLQUM6,I called UPN (before it turned to the CW) almost every day and wrote email after email asking them to release the show on dvd and that by doing so it would make millions of fans around the world happy. After awhile I gave up because I kept getting the run around over the phone and stopped getting a reply from the emails I was sending. Then two days ago out the blue I decided to check out the website and to my surprise they finally decided to release it. I like to think that I (along with many other fans I'm sure) had a little something to do with this phenomenon. At last my fellow Girlfriends fans...victory is ours!,1168214400,3,623,4.2
2694535,5,B000KLQUM6,"I agree w/ the other reviewers that the 1st season was a bit off.  But, if you are a huge fan, I too suggest that you buy the 1st season.  It will encourage Paramount to release the others.  If you are not yet a fan, I'd still suggest getting it.  It can be good background in case you have recently started watching it.",1167696000,4,320,4.031746031746032
2694536,4,B000KLQUM6,"Although season 1 of Girlfriends was a tad off the mark, they were probably just going thru growing pains.  They really hit the mark in seasons 2 thru 6.  Why they took 6 years to start releasing the first DVD is puzzling to me.  I started taping them about 2 years ago, but gave that up due to the bulkiness of vhs tapes.  I will be ordering the season 1, and hopefully they will release the other seasons.  If anyone finds out why they took 6 years to release Girlfriends on DVD please share it with us.",1166313600,7,505,4.164948453608248
2694537,5,B000KLQUM6,"Finally, Paramount is releasing my favorite show in DVD!! I screamed out loud when I read the news.  My friends and I pop popcorn and watch the show every week.  It's the one of the few times of week we just get together and have fun.  It's our weekly ritual.  I suggest everyone buy this because then Paramount will release the other seasons.  The first season wasn't the best, but buying it will be worth it to get the other ones.  So go out and BUY IT!!! Because I will!!!",1165276800,6,475,4.222222222222222
2694538,5,B000KLQUM6,"I had stumbled on to this show two years ago was surprised that it was accually funny. Usually I don't watch much tv shows because they are a cookie cutter of other shows on prime time. If I  had seen one comedy or drama I had seen them all. I fell in love with this show because of the development of the characters (though the first season was off a bit), smart, and it's funny. This show is not the usual redundancy of prime time.",1165190400,4,433,4.094117647058823
2694539,4,B000KLQUM6,"Girlfriends is one of my favorite shows.  I have been waiting and waiting for the release on DVD.  I have seen shows that have not been on but one or two seasons already released on DVD.  Why did it take so long for this?

I have my suspicions, but I won't say.  Hope the sales are great so that the rest of the seasons will be released also.",1165190400,3,342,3.9705882352941178
2694540,2,B000KLQUM6,"I am one of the biggest ""Girlfriends"" fans. Although it has not been DVD yet i have seen the whole first season on TV and from my prospective it was one of the worst season of the show so far, because it was a brand new show and the story lines were not so intresting. The hiar, mackeup, wardrobe, and dialog was really off and the little ""Joan"" moments where every thing pauses and joan has a on camere thought in hear head was really the worst part. although in my opinion the first season was the worst, I WOULD STILL BUY THIS DVD because wonce the sales of this set goes well it will give Paramount the green light to release the other seasons, (witch were way better) you see how long it took for the studio to even consider to release the show on DVD. The show is now in its 7th year as one of the longest runnig Upn shows ever. It now continues on The CW.",1165017600,5,862,4.076470588235294

8158107,3,B000KLQUM6,"As a woman of a certain age, I really wanted to like this, but the acting was over the top, and I wasn't sympathetic to the main plot--death at sea.

8158111,3,B000KLQUM6,OK but annoying at times - especially Sue.  Over the top emotional outbursts - do people really act like this?  Makes women look bad,1522195200,,132,4.458333333333333

8158115,2,B000KLQUM6,All three ladies who star in Girlfriends are some of my favorites. I only found a few parts of the first season mildly entertaining but toward the end if went downhill.  The storyline wasn't the best and I found it disappointing. I think the writers missed an opportunity for a great comedy show with three older ladies.,1520553600,,320,4.614035087719298
