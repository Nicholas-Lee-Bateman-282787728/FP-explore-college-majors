It's ultraviolent and poetic and visceral and wild. It's a giddy and manic ode to filmmaking, particularly the dying art of 35mm.

I'll try to briefly explain the somewhat convoluted plot without spoiling it. There's these nerds, the Fuck Bombers and they want to make a movie and they're obsessed with it and so over-enthusiastic, they put Tarantino to shame. They're a bit hapless and perhaps not too good at making movies but that doesn't matter. They run in with some Yakuza and a hot young actress (daughter of a Yakuza boss) and said Yakuza boss wants to make a movie to impress his imprisoned wife so the Fuck Bombers end up taking the job only it's not actually a movie (but it is), it's actually a ploy to confront and kill a rival Yakuza gang, whose leader has a decade-long crush on the other Yakuza boss's daughter. What follows is a battle to the death that rivals Kill Bill and puts Tarantino to shame.

Easily the best movie I've seen in at least a decade.",1410912000,,1149,4.519230769230769
