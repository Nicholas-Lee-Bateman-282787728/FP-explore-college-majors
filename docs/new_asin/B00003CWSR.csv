1261552,4,B00003CWSR,"Liberty Heights was one of those movies that seemingly came and went and was forgotten before anyone really had a chance to see it. This isn't all  that surprising considering the film didn't contain many things blowing up,  didn't have any special effects to speak of, and lacked a big name star.  It's a shame though, because this is really a hidden treasure. I wouldn't  even know how to categorize this movie. I suppose ""coming of age""  film would be the most generic way. The plot centers around two Jewish  brothers, one in high school, one a bit older, growing up in a  predominantly Jewish neighborhood in the 1950s who come to the enlightened  realization that 99% of the country is non-Jewish and some are even of a  different race! Thankfully the film never gets preachy about this subject;  the boys come to this discovery while avoiding the annoying cliches that  ""message"" movies are too often filled with.
What I enjoyed so  much about this film, besides the terrific performances by the mostly  little known actors, was the quality of the writing. In most films centered  around teenagers I have a difficult time suspending disbelief because the  characters don't act like real teens would in the given situation. Not so  with this film. The relationship between the main character, Ben, and his  newfound black friend, Sylvia, progresses almost exactly as I imagine it  would have in real life. And when the older brother, Van, comes to the  discovery that just because we might idealize someone (in this case a  beautiful, blond, WASP), it doesn't necessarily mean the idealized  individual deserves the admiration, I had to smile, having had very similar  experiences in my own dating life.
The only real flaw I can think of in  ""Liberty Heights"" is a subplot regarding the boys father, and the  trouble he gets into when a numbers scam he is running goes sour. It just  seemed like one of those things they add into a movie to add more conflict.  I thought the story of these two brothers was strong enough to carry the  film, without having to throw in the somewhat convoluted  subplot.
Otherwise, I highly recommend seeing this extremely  underappreciated movie.",965692800,4,2184,4.842818428184282
1261553,4,B00003CWSR,"Barry Levinson has returned yet again to Baltimore for his latest and has turned out an entertaining, if a little flawed, winner.  It is the story of  a Jewish family in the fifties, narrated by the youngest son, looking back  on his senior year in high school from what I presume to be the present.  The two sons and their father confront other socio-economic sets with  amusing results.  The older son falls for an unbelievabley waspy, wealthy  young woman.  The younger son falls for a young black woman.  The movie,  while funny, charming and well acted lacks cohesion and is a bit too  episodic.  It's still a lot of fun to watch and viewers will not be  disappointed.  It's just not a masterpiece the way Diner was (but movies of  that caliber a few and far between).  If you have enjoyed Levinson's  earlier Baltimore movies (Avalon, Tin Men, Diner), you will no doubt enjoy  this one.",965088000,2,892,4.608974358974359
1261554,5,B00003CWSR,"Liberty Heights is one of those deeply felt movies about innocence and childhood. Set during the 1950's about a jewish family named the kurtzmans  who live in Liberty Heights a suburb of Baltimore. In a time of racial  diversity and integration. Two sons Ben Foster and Adrian Brody experience  life. Ben meets this African american girl from school who is very sweet  and pretty in his eyes. Adrian Brody plays Van who is the older son. Both  sons of a Burlesque house owner father played Joe mantegna. In the hands of  Barry levinson this is a deeply felt funny movie. The fourth installment of  his Baltimore series. With a winning cast Including Ben Foster, Adrian  Brody, Joe mantegna and Bebe Neuwirth who is a great actress and is not in  the movie enough in my personal opinion. A very good movie worthy of  attention and deeply felt. This is a worthy installment in Barry Levinsons  Baltimore series.",964828800,2,909,4.726114649681529
1261555,2,B00003CWSR,"This was a very disappointing movie.  Barry Levinson's record on Baltimore-based movies has been excellent:  ""Avalon"" and ""Diner"" are films to be seen over and over.  ""...And Justice  for All"" [as co-writer, not director] is a memorable black comedy.  And ""Tin Men"" is OK.  ""Liberty Heights"" just does not  come together; it's all over the place.  The segments featuring Ben Foster  as the younger son almost work, thanks to the actor.  Joe Mantegna shows  what a great professional actor can do with weak material.  Adrien Brody as  the older son spends much of the film [this is definitely a movie, not a  film] looking confused; probably more as the result of not receiving help  from the director as to what his segments are all about.  The confusion and  the stereotyping in these segments [about the supposed lifestyles of  wealthy English-Americans] are embarrassing.  Even more distressing are the  scenes involving a black drug dealer.  This is one of those cases where one  wishes a talented filmmaker had a good friend who could look at the filmed  bits and ask, ""Are you sure you want to do this?""  With this kind  of semi-autobiographical movie, one is tempted to cut the director some  slack because of the overlap between hazy nostalgia and an ostensibly  accurate depiction of past events. However, in this case the result is not  worth the ambiguity.  This is the kind of movie people want to like.  It is  supposed to be personal and it is dealing with socially important issues.  Fine.  But, it has to be evaluated as a MOVIE and, as such, it fails.",963705600,6,1568,4.774436090225564
1261556,4,B00003CWSR,"Who says they don't make nice, intimate films anymore?  ""Liberty Heights"" is a movie that deserves a bigger audience than it eventually got.  Barry Levinson has written a film with plenty of sweet moments--the  mating dance between a Jewish boy and black girl, the sobering realization  that the ideal girl isn't everything she seems to be, and the deep bond  between family.  Levinson elicits strong performances from Ben Foster,  Adrien Brody, and the rest of the spirited cast.  This is a film well worth  renting (or buying eventually).",963187200,3,540,5.045454545454546
1261557,4,B00003CWSR,"Writer/Director Barry Levinson was prompted to make Liberty Heights after he became infuriated over what he perceived to be an anti-Semitic comment made by Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum in her review of  Levinson's Sphere (he accuses her of unnecessarily emphasizing the  Jewishness of Dustin Hoffman's character). All I can say after viewing this  superb film is that I hope more film critics piss Mr. Levinson off, for his  fourth foray into the Baltimore of his youth is richly nostalgic without  being overly sentimental (which was Avalon's biggest flaw). The young cast,  headed by newcomer Ben Foster and ex-The Thin Red Liner Adrien Brody, does  a fine job of bringing to life Levinson's vivid characterizations of  sensitive adolescents struggling to come to terms with the colliding social  and ethnic spheres of America in the 1950's. Levinson does a commendable  job of avoiding the stereotypes that plague many of the films about the  youth of this era; for example, the young African American girl that Ben  Kurtzman becomes attracted to (Sylvia, played by the beautiful and charming  Rebekah Johnson) is not some uneducated inner-city slum girl, but rather  the intelligent daughter of a respected and wealthy physician; also, the  WASP trust-fund-baby princess that is the object of Van Kurtzman's lust  (Dubbie, played very capably by model Carolyn Murphy) reveals herself to be  tormented by familial troubles that push her to find relief in alcohol and  promiscuity; and, most notably, Dubbie's WASP boyfriend Trey (Justin  Chambers) avoids prejudicial bulliness and ends up befriending and looking  out for Van rather than eschewing him for his Jewish  background.
Occasionally, Liberty Heights falters when Levinson belabors  the Jewish point, but this flaw is negligible in the light of the film's  enormous strengths, not the least of which is expert cinematographer Chris  Doyle's fluid, vibrant images (Doyle is Hong Kong maverick writer/director  Wong Kar-Wai's longtime collaborator) and Andrea Morricone's moving and  low-key score (very reminiscent of his father's emotionally resonant work).  These highly talented artists come together to craft a film of quiet beauty  and lasting poignancy.",962841600,21,2241,5.473684210526316
1261558,5,B00003CWSR,"Why LIBERTY HEIGHTS didn't enjoy a bigger box office presence and success is only evidence that the tender little movies get buried by the blockbuster explosion epics.  This incredibly adroit recapturing of the  1950's, with all the incipient class and race issues just below the  headline level, helps us understand our own insecurites no matter which one  of the numerous minority groups we each claim.

I truly enjoyed this coming of age movie based in Baltimore. I grew up in the Bronx and the similarities of what was going on at that time in our history is so exact. I related to the characters and to their expereinces growing up during a time when you didn't cross the invisible borders that separated neighborhoods by race/economics.

Put them all together and you have Liberty Heights.  This is a wonderful little hidden treasure of a film that I am very happy I found.

Anti-semitism is a multi-faceted thorny issue, as old as forever, and this movie is one of the best depictions of it. This includes many aspects of American anti-semitism during the 1950's that are often not quite spelled out.

1261642,4,B00003CWSR,"It's hard to watch Liberty Heights without finding it a pastiche of Barry Levinson's previous three films about Baltimore and its engaging residents and neighborhoods.  Liberty Heights has goofy young males, seemingly unattainable American princesses, flawed but loving families, a businessman (albeit a crooked one) caught on the cusp of societal change, an abiding love of big cars, and esoteric late night diner conversations.  All those elements are found in one or more of Diner, Tin Men, and Avalon (and that perfect scene of fireworks bursting over the new immigrant's head, one of my favorite movie scenes ever.) Still, I was happy to watch these new riffs on some old themes because new elements keep getting added, in this case a more direct depiction of the barriers and prejudices of the era.  Unappealing though some of them may be, you find yourself rooting for almost all of Levinson's characters, hoping they'll make it safely through to the other side of the enormous gap between the fifties and the late sixties.  Liberty Heights also brings a fine performance from Adrian Brody and an even better one from the always quiet, but always pitch perfect Joe Mantegna.",1225670400,,1181,5.041025641025641

1261645,5,B00003CWSR,"A lot of Americans---especially the younger generations---are breathtakingly ignorant of their own very recent history, and films like ""Liberty Heights"" are invaluable for reminding us that no, this country has never been a utopian paradise of freedom as current day simpletons (read: George W. Bush and all his right wing partisan prostitutes like Rush Limbaugh, etc.) would have us believe.

The idea is not to fixate on the past but to use it as a guidepost towards the future---the kind of racist and anti-semitic world that ""Liberty Heights"" portrays has abated on many fronts but is far from vanquished, and all this progress did not magically arise but was the fruit of the blood sweat and tears of many principled and brave individuals over the course of the last several decades.  Many battles have been won but the war is not over by a long shot.

Aside from social history, Levinson's film is also stirring entertainment: he has assembled a very strong cast, with an excellent script and masterful camera direction.  ""Liberty Heights"" does not have the grand epic sweep of ""Avalon"" but is deals more directly with racial and ethnic tensions in 1950s Baltimore without falling into the usual cliches and sensationalistic traps that such socially conscious films (see ""Grand Canyon"" or recent Spike Lee movies) often stoop to.  This is no cheap Hollywood tear-jerker but an honest, balanced and very mature work---probably explains why it tanked at the box office.",1113091200,5,1473,5.070247933884297
1261646,4,B00003CWSR,"1) My daughter was a featured extra who had a close up in the film's opening scene. As the story opens in a Jewish neighborhood in Baltimore in 1954 or so the narrator tells the audience how he thought everyone in the world was Jewish. The camera pans to his elementary school classrom while the teacher calls the roll, Bernstein, Cohan, Cohen, etc. He says he even thought Ling (my daughter) was Jewish as the camera zooms in on her. Okay that explains why I liked the film and bought the DVD. Why should you?

 2). It is a nice, sweet movie that is suitable for family viewing. (Caveat: there is one rather muted scene in which the younger son, played well by Ben Foster, appeared to get a bit over excited by his love interest. You have to be a bit older to understand what happened though). Although it does not leave as lasting an impact as Diner or Avalon on the viewer it is well worth viewing in DVD.

 It has an excellent ensemble cast led by Joe Mantegna plays the father and Bebe Neuwirth the prototypical gulit inducing mother. Ben Foster plays the younger brother and Adrien Brody (pre-Oscar winner days) plays the older brother. The films consists of a series of stories each of which involves the intrusion of the brave new world of integration into a cohesive ethnic enclave. There are some extremely funny scenes and dialogue. Ben Foster and his friends walk away from a public pool after seeing a sign stating: ""No Jews, Coloreds, or Dogs."" Rather than anger they engage in an extended discussion as to why the three groups were set out in that particular order. It was both funny and moving.

 Ben falls for a young classmate, the girl who integrated the school. Their relationship (sweet and puppyish) is met by consternation by both sets of parents. Adrien Brody, the older brother, falls for an anglo-saxon blonde and runs into much resistance as he works his way into her 'crowd'. Mantegna's burlesque club and numbers running set him apart from the more rigid confines of his crowd. Levinson approaches these stories with a light hand and humorous touch. He does not preach. He simply tells their stories.

 As noted, this movie does not have the same impact as Diner or Avalon and this may explain, in part, its rapid disappearance from movie theaters. The DVD, which contains a number of added items (trailers, crew interviews, etc.), is a nice opportunity to spend a very pleasnt two hours.",1090281600,5,2417,4.644028103044496
1261647,5,B00003CWSR,"The first time I watched this movie was on a whim and I didn't know what to expect from it. I quickly found myself becoming infatuated with the story line. Barry Levinson has created a masterpiece with this film that stars Joe Mategna, Ben Foster, Adrien Brody and Bebe Neuwirth who are theKurtzman family living in suburbian Baltimore, Maryland in a place called Liberty Heights in the year 1954. Along the way their experiences are chronicled as integration has just begun. I could go on and on, but you have got to see this movie for yourself.

1261648,5,B00003CWSR,"Barry Levinson's semi-autobiographical look at life in the mid '50's, from a Jewish perspective, is funny, interesting, and poignant, and fairly strange.  It ironically stars Joe Montegna as a Jewish business man, with many troubles, Bebe Neuwirth, as his wife and some other interesting characters.  One funny, but not funny, moment (if your Jewish) is when his son tries to go to a Halloween party dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the horror of his mother and grandmother (which is understandable).  An interesting side story is the relationship between one son and a highly attractive (black) girl.  Prejudice runs several ways in this movie; a definite reflection of the times, but does not detract from it.  [An aside-the only thing that marred the viewing of this disc was a slight bit of debris; which I cleared off and then the disc played fine-a bit of advice to all dvd users to check and clean edge to edge; never, ever, in a circular fashion.] Otherwise a fine film.

Nothing REALLY bad happens, but you always feel like it might with all the religious and racial tension that runs rampantly through the society of Baltimore in the immediate post-war (WWII) era. Apart from conveying the societal norms and conventions the film centres on a Jewish family which begins with the narrator telling the viewer that prior to going to school he thought the whole world was Jewish because he never knew anything different. This is an interesting observation. This is pretty much the way all people see their early experiences unless they are subjected to a large amount of diversity, and most of us in middle class America are not. The sense of humour and tradition that runs through the film is subtle and clever. The characters are imbued with life, and the actors bring the script to life.

1261693,2,B00003CWSR,"This film started out with some great moments, such as the young Jewish boy's first encounter with lunchmeat on white bread at the home of a gentile friend  -- served with MILK yet!  (For non-Jews reading this, the kosher laws forbid serving meat and milk at the same meal -- it just doesn't happen in Jewish cuisine.)  And I loved his parents' shocked reaction when, in a creative stroke of adolescent rebellion, he dresses up as Adolf Hitler for a Halloween party.  But I soon became bored with this attempt to do a Jewish version of American Graffiti (if that's what it was...)  After 45 minutes of trying to find a plot that went beyond drooling over girls who were forbidden fruit, I finally gave up.
 My impression is, that this film was a disconnected series of nostalgic vignettes from Levinson's childhood, strung together on a weak thread about how hard it was to be Jewish in the 1950s.  Problem is, I already KNOW it was hard to be Jewish in the 50s -- so what else is new? Although the acting was good and the characters were sometimes interesting, the script itself didn't hang together.  The subplot about the father's burlesque show and the numbers game served no real purpose in the story except to give an excuse to have a stripper strut her stuff every other scene change.  Or was this a broad hint that the scenes were like vaudeville acts, each entertaining in itself, but only loosely related to the rest of the show?  Whatever Levinson's intent, this movie just did not cut it for me.",980035200,8,1507,4.568773234200743
1261694,4,B00003CWSR,"""Liberty Heights"" revolves around a Jewish middle class Baltimore family of the mid 1950's.  The father (Joe Mantega) is a decent and  honorable man who just happens to earn a living as a boss of an illegal gambling organization.  He is not perceived as a criminal to his  immediate community, but merely as a family bread winner doing the best he can.  To hide his earnings from the IRS, the father also runs a  unprofitable burlesque house.  The acts are so tame by today's standards that they seem hysterically funny instead of lascivious.  Many like myself born into a minority Catholic background will readily commiserate with the young son (Ben Foster) who is astonished to learn that few people in the world are Jewish. There is a  warm and tender scene where the child unintentionally insults his gentile lady host for serving him white bread, luncheon meat, and milk.  The boy is appalled by all the revolting ""white stuff"" on the table. The innocent child looks at the well meaning woman as some sort of weird  human being. Later we observe him as a teenager tackling the mysteries of adolescent sexuality and interracial relations. He  is forced to learn that racial prejudice is not limited to the outright cruel and uncivilized.  The older brother (Adrien Brody) is already thrust into an adult world where being Jewish  is an serious obstacle to full economic and social participation.  His buddy even goes so far as to hide his Jewish heritage from a WASP female in  order not to repel her.  This incident is very uncomfortable to watch.  The whole family undergoes a crisis when the father's betting  operation has to make good on a bet that it doesn't have the money to cover.  These characters are engaging and the audience cares about  what happens to them.  We may even get to love them.
This latest Barry Levinson quasi-bographical release failed at the box office.  It was a well done film deserving of respect but perhaps made  twenty years too late.  Do I recommend this movie?  The answer is yes.  Levinson is offering us sufficient new material and themes to make  it worth our while.  Nonetheless, I suspect that the great film maker perhaps should think twice before returning again to his roots for  creative inspiration.  Levinson may have gone to this particular well one too many times. The subject matter is starting to exhaust even his  most loyal admirers.  Most of us have already seen the beautiful and thought provoking ""Diner"" and ""Avalon.""  I dare say that ""Liberty Heights"" would have been financially successful  only if Jews were still victims of virulent discrimination. Younger Jews fortunately (  or at least I hope this is the case!) can no longer identify with an era of almost fifty years ago when signs were posted on Baltimore area  swimming polls denying admission to ""Jews, Dogs, or Coloreds.""  Some anti-Semitism persists today in America, but it is rarely blatant.  Most hostility  usually results from the low self esteem of individuals possessing marginal power and influence.  Ignoring history increases the chance of evil  repeating itself.  The overindulgence of focussing on past troubles, though, may deter us from confronting the challenges of the here and  now.",977529600,12,3225,4.91449814126394
1261695,2,B00003CWSR,"If there is one subject the reflective, autobiographically-inclined filmmaker seems to obsess about above all others, it is the glorious innocence of his own childhood. This seems to be doubly the case when that upbringing has taken place in a heavily ethnic family and neighborhood filled with intergenerational and societal conflicts. With Barry Levinson, of course, the scene is the Jewish section of Baltimore known as Liberty Heights at a time - 1954 - in which the old standards of segregation and unquestioning devotion to tradition were beginning to crumble in the face of an up-and-coming generation of freethinking youths. The youths in this case are two brothers in their late teens, sons of a local burlesque theater proprietor and local numbers runner, who face down anti-Semitism as they flirt with interracial and cross-cultural dating.
`Liberty Heights' is a perfectly decent little film, well acted, relaxed in its pacing and admirably lacking in obvious melodramatics. Its portrayal of interracial tensions - paradoxically, between two equally despised and mistreated minorities, Jews and blacks - is surprisingly restrained and subtle. Thanks, too, to understated performances from a first-rate cast (Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe Mantegna) and an air of casual believability in its screenplay, the film does relatively well by itself. Most admirably of all, the movie does not overstate the villainous qualities of its `bad guys,' and by so doing, manages to see the subtle shadings of virtues and faults that lie in each of us.
However, all this niceness comes with a price. With so little in the way of genuine conflict, the film seems to wander a bit aimlessly for much of its running time. For one thing, the relationship between the father and his two sons remains strangely sketchy, possibly because they share very little screen time together. We never sense the reality of the bond that so obviously exists between them, so much so, that, when the father is finally caught and sent off to prison, we have no way to fairly register the feelings or reactions of the boys. Not only does this incident seem to leave no mark on their emotions, it provides no sense of how it colors their perceptions of their father's moral character.
The unfortunate fact is that this material has simply been played out now by the umpteen similar films which have come before it. What are needed at this late date are some fresh insights to help breathe some new life into the formula. These Levinson, as both writer and director, simply fails to provide. We watch with cool detachment as the scenes play themselves out in predictable and uninspiring fashion. Perhaps it is time for filmmakers as a whole to move on past thinking that their every childhood memory should serve as fodder for the audience's edification. Unfortunately, for `Liberty Heights,' fine as it is at times, we discover we much prefer our own childhood experiences to theirs.  **1/2",976406400,9,2966,5.053061224489796
1261696,4,B00003CWSR,"Director Barry Levinson will certainly not be remembered in the future thanks to such movies as RAIN MAN or SPHERE but rather for his Baltimore movies DINER, TIN MEN, AVALON and now LIBERTY HEIGHTS. This director is clearly suffering from the Clint Eastwood syndrome : a filmography divided in two sections. Like Clint, Barry Levinson has to direct blockbusters to have the right to direct more personal movies that won't bring a penny to Hollywood studios.
Don't think for a minute that the Baltimore of Barry Levinson has anything to do with the Baltimore described by John Waters, another glorious son of the city. No, it's the Baltimore of the 50's and 60's that Barry Levinson recreates again and again, a Baltimore seen with the tenderness of the souvenirs. LIBERTY HEIGHTS is a perfect entry for the social comedy genre.
LIBERTY HEIGHTS is also a movie about integration and Barry Levinson uses in a smart way the american inclination for cars to describe how racism is nothing more than the fear of something that is unknown to us, even if these strange things or people are only a block away. People must move, in their head or by car, in order to strengthen the social cement.
Above average bonus features with, among a lot of goodies, interviews of the cast, a featurette and trailers ( LIBERTY HEIGHTS and DINER ).
A DVD to discover.",975196800,,1345,4.752136752136752
1261697,3,B00003CWSR,"Barry Levinson writes and directs a story about growing up Jewish in Baltimore, MD in the 1950's, a topic he knows a lot about being a native of  that city born in 1942.  As a period piece, this is outstanding.  As a  comedy/drama, it has its moments but is too scattered to have much impact.  The story follows the lives of Nate Kurtzman (Joe Mantegna), and his two  sons, Van (Adrian Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster) over the period of one year.  Nate's subplot shows his life as a small-time racketeer.  Van develops a  crush on a wealthy gentile girl at a party, and spends much of the film  pining after her.  When he finally gets to know her better he finds that  she is much different than he had imagined.  Ben develops a crush on a  black girl in his class and embarks on a friendship with her that flies in  the face of the taboos of the times.
The entire film revolved around a  single theme, i.e. how hard it was to grow up Jewish in the 1950's.  Much  of the material was amusing, some disturbing and some charming, but  Levinson was so intent on relieving (or reliving) his angst that he kept  wandering from the main storylines.  If he had focused more on the  relationship between Ben and Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), it would have been a  much stronger film.
As a period piece on the `50's, this is outstanding.  The costumes and props were perfect and the entire film had a genuine 50's  feeling to it.  Levinson captured not only the images, but also the  attitudes.
The ensemble cast was very solid.  Joe Montegna is always  terrific, especially when he is playing a crook.  He is extremely  believable in those roles and though he has tried to break out of the type,  he keeps coming back because he does it so well.  Ben Foster gave a  wonderful performance played with a great deal of wit and sensitivity.  He  and Rebekah Johnson had excellent chemistry and made the forbidden  relationship enchanting.
This film had potential, but Levinson' mission  to expose injustice kept distracting him from the storyline and dissipated  its overall effect.  I rated it 6/10.  Add a point if you are Jewish and  another if you are nostalgic about the 1950's.  Not bad, but it could have  been much better.",968889600,8,2210,4.513994910941475
1261698,5,B00003CWSR,"I love his recollections of the 1950s in Baltimore which mirror the same era where I grew up, Cleveland.  Levinson's story is very intimate about  families, friends and relationships forming or not forming within that time  frame and locale.  This film reminds me of an earlier film of his,  ""Avalon"", which depicted the most marvelous relationship between  a boy and his grandfather.  This newest movie has a family at its core too:  a Jewish family with mother, father, grandmother and two sons, all living  together.  What I like best is that Levinson goes for ""days in the  lives of"" these characters rather than tacking some contrived plot on  these people to move things along instead.

You literally see them become  the people they are through leading their daily lives and what happens in  those lives.  I didn't find the black drug dealer a contrived aspect since  the father owned a numbers racket and could be expected to cross the paths  of other criminals. Besides, Levinson did not let his movie become a crime  thriller by inserting the black drug dealer whereas so many other writers  would have let the whole movie descend to that level.  If you are a fan of  ""Avalon"" or ""Diner"", and I am, than it is hard for me  to see how you can go wrong with this movie either.
