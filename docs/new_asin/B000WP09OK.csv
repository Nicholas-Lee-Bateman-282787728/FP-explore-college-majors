We love this series and can't wait to finish it when I have time off from work. It was also much cheaper to buy here rather than the History Channel website, so I am glad I shopped at Amazon.com before I purchased it at History Channel.",1264377600,18,359,4.294117647058823
2989178,4,B000WP09OK,Overall it was good.  Each war are created by different people so some were better than others.  The Revolutionary War and the Alamo were both excellent.  Each documentary included not only the battles but talked about the issues surrounding the war.  The Civil War is the weakest in the series.  It looked like the documentary was just an excuse to show a lot of death and violence.  WWII was another strong one.  It talked about the end of the war and the Nuremberg Trials.  The Vietnam war had some amazing up close war footage.,1251504000,4,531,4.574468085106383

2989181,2,B000WP09OK,"These DVDs contain mostly personal stories and less historical accuracy of how each war broke out and why. It did not even go into why the American revolution started.

The video quality is awful.

The first three DVDs were pretty good, but the rest were lacking badly.

2989187,5,B000WP09OK,"Well I recieved this as a Christmas Present due to my complaining of History Channel's lack of ANYTHING to do with history anymore. And I've watched almost all and I love it. The WWII one I figured was gonna be bland and just re show the things EVERYONE's scene before. But it didn't show Hitler's rise to power and all of that over played stuff...but rather an insight into the last days of it. The WWI DVD was also VERY well done. Hands down, if you're new to Military History maybe this isn't for you but if you're a person who's going deeper into war history GET THIS DVD!",1325376000,8,576,4.293577981651376
2989188,1,B000WP09OK,"I have never before written such an extensive review and I really hope my efforts helps someone to avoid this product, or at least buy with full knowledge of what they are, and most importantly not, getting.

This is a review of the 2008 product which is 1948 minutes long, the 2009 product is 2241 minutes. Potential buyers could ask the company if the additional 293 minutes corrected the problems the concerns I have with the product.

In order to determine if the problems with the set I purchased had been corrected in the newer edition I phoned and emailed the History Channel asking for information. After three weeks I have not received a response so I am going to post this review in the hopes that it will help others avoid the disappointment I experienced.

This is a fourteen DVD set.

1. 1-3 DVDs deal with the revolution. A well done presentation that clearly shows the war was not about taxation without representation, that the tea party was nothing more than a bunch of people who had financial interests in causing problems by destroying the property of others, and that the colonists did not win the war but the Spanish and French did. It does a good job of showing how financing the war caused the beheading of a king. A well done and balanced presentation.

2. DVD 4 deals with the Alamo and again is a good presentation showing that this was a group of illegal aliens causing a problem for Mexico's government. Does not sugar coat the backgrounds of those involved nor of the despair Mexican leaders had in loosing their great land.

3. DVDs 5 and 6 deals with a small part of the Civil War. This presentation was positively horrible. No discussion was given to the who, what, why and results of the war. It is nothing more than a lot of blood and guts. A true shame. The audio mixing was horrible.

4. DVD 7 deals with World War 1, and again is a well rounded and complete explanation of the reasons, and results, of the war. It even sets the stage for World War II. This, all in one DVD. An excellent job worthy of being watched by any student. One would never know that the same company that produced DVDs 5, 6, 8 & 9 did 7.

5. DVDs 8 & 9 deal with World War II. Well not really - it deals with the end of the war, makes no sense at all, is just as bad as DVDs 5 & 6 that covered the Civil War, lots of blood and guts and no logic. It does show how General Eisenhower was upset with the concentration camps but had no problem with the allies killing civilians in cities for no reason at all. The extras showing the secret dealings are interesting and informative and to learn that the Japanese were doing a much better job in developing weapons of mass destruction and planes than we were was very interesting. They just did not get it done as quickly as we did. It was also interesting to learn how the Japanese legally bought the plans to our best military aircrafts. Unfortunately none of this can compensate for the total lack of covering even the reason we were part of the second world war, possibly because there was none, I certainly do not know and the DVD did not help. It should also be noted that the audio was of a quality that would get an ""F"" in most high school classes!

6. The DVDs on Korea (10) and Vietnam (11)were well done. It showed how presidents made drastically poor decisions, failed to confront the enemy and misled the nation. One has to seriously wonder why congress would support such an effort, why our youth would submit to a draft when we were not at war and by what logic anyone would agree to pay for a non war. It does raise the question as to who, in fact, paid for it. It is very clear that elected officials and generals have no problem using our youth for cannon fodder as long as it serves their own, and those who benefit from war, purposes.

7. The Gulf War (12) was also well done and showed the failures of our leaders. No holes barred here.

8. The two DVDs on the Iraq War were fantastic. Again no holes barred showing the failures of both our political and military leaders. One can be very proud of our friends and family members that have decided to sacrifice their safety and future in a clearly misguided effort by our leaders. The History folks should be proud that they are willing to show us the truth behind the deceptions our leaders present to us.",1314921600,9,4332,4.362282878411911
2989189,3,B000WP09OK,"Not a bad collection of America at war, though some things are missing like the Spanish and American War. World War II could've been better explained, but the Vietnam, Iraqi Freedom, Desert Storm, and Revolutionary War DVDs were quite impressive! I would recommend buying this collection just for those alone!",1283212800,18,309,5.2
2989190,3,B000WP09OK,"This is quite a good series, but it's certainly not comprehensive or detailed in its presentation of the various interpretations and views that are held about the conflicts involved.  I would recommend it as an accompanying set to more detailed and academic presentations.  Interesting if only for the reminder of just how many conflicts a 'peace loving ' people have been involved in.",1281571200,8,385,5.095238095238095

I really enjoyed this one. I didn't mind watching it at all. They cover the events from different angles than most and it really makes it interesting.",1420070400,,312,4.396551724137931
8225056,1,B000WP09OK,"""America at War"" is book ended with two stellar looks at two very different conflicts, but in-between, it largely fails to deliver the goods in terms of comprehensive content. As I've stated before, these programs are all well made, but leave me as a viewer wanting more. At best this set is a nice sampler platter, but most interested parties would be best served by searching out individual comprehensive sets. To try and sum up WWII in two discs or the Vietnam War in one is a travesty, no matter how good the programs do their job at covering a limited scope.",1391904000,,563,4.529411764705882
