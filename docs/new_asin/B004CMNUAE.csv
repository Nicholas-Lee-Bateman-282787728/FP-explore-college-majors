8423250,4,B004CMNUAE,"I tend to agree with the criticisms above.  Both volumes total only about 63 minutes all together.
The sound is pretty bad, though the commentary is informative.  What's worth the price are the
clips themselves.  Fascinating.  Still, it should be on only one dvd.
If you want a real documentary on vaudeville, I highly recommend
""Vaudeville, an American Masters Production"" narrated by Ben Vereen.
Terrific.",1424822400,,407,5.2153846153846155

Half the video has narration, while the other half (e.g., history section had still pictures with obviously intended narration, yet did not play that narration).",1393200000,,275,5.088888888888889

8423253,1,B004CMNUAE,"Mostly animal acts, bulesque queens, and circus side shows.  Burlesque queens never appeared in vaudeville, which was always clean, family entertainment.  The commentary that-- men liked to see burlesque queens in vaudeville--  indicates the author of the commentary doesn't have accurate information about real vaudeville history.",1357776000,,331,6.1521739130434785
