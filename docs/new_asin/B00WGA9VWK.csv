8713287,5,B00WGA9VWK,I love this series. I gave this product five stars because the all the seasons included in the box work perfectly and are brand new. I have never ever had any issues with any dvds. This whole product is perfect from the hardware to the actually show included. The Mentalist has to be my number one favorite show.,1501718400,5,312,4.396551724137931
