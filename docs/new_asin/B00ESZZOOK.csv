5942937,4,B00ESZZOOK,"These two movies were among my favorites from the early 80s , it is hard to find late 70, s early 80s movies on dvd.",1388275200,2,116,3.68
5942938,5,B00ESZZOOK,"As soon as the opening credits of Walter Grauman's ""Are You in the House Alone?"" roll, and you hear the jive-talking boogie theme music, you know you are being transported back to the late '70s.  This movie has often been compared in some respects to ""Halloween,"" as both feature the use of unsteady, subjective camera work, in which the victim(s) are viewed through the creepy eyes of the perpetrator, not to mention that they both appeared at virtually the same time (in the fall of 1978), and the action in both takes place in a big, creeky old house.

The fact remains, though, that ""Are You in the House Alone?"" was undoubtedly not without influence of its own, and should be acknowledged as such.  Specifically, I feel that several scenes from the following year's ""When a Stranger Calls"" (Fred Walton, 1979) were lifted whole from the earlier ""Alone.""  And yet I personally find Grauman's film to be the more enjoyable and suspenseful of the two.

""Are You in the House Alone?"", based on a 1976 novel by Richard Peck, concerns a beautiful high school student named Gail (Kathleen Beller of ""Dynasty"") as the new girl in an undisclosed San Francisco suburb.  She makes friends with Alison (Robin Mattson, who appeared on the NBC soap opera ""Santa Barbara"" in the late '80s), and early on in the film it is apparent that Gail has caught the unwanted attention of an obsessed stalker.  First, she and Alison are spied on while in a state of undress in their bathing suits at a lake.  This soon escalates into Gail receiving an anonymous, late night heavy breathing phone call, followed by a creepy note left in her locker warning ""I'm Watching You.""  Like many high school girls her age, Gail makes extra money at a babysitting job, and pretty soon the psycho tracks her down there and the calls get more and more threatening and ominous, culminating in the sicko whispering to Gail in a warped voice, ""Are you in the house alone?"".  A showdown between Gail and her stalker ensues, and the slimy male culprit is revealed to be capable of not just sexual and mental harassment, but physical acts of violence as well.  Red herrings as to the caller's identity abound, and I'll admit that this one had me guessing to the final frame, a technique that was again utilized by many a low budget slasher film only a couple years later, once again demonstrating this TV movie's considerable influence.

I for one just love this one.  I first saw it in a showing on cable over 20 years ago, and I've remained a fan ever since.  And let it be said that the first time I saw it, it did indeed succeed in seriously scaring and disturbing me.  There is a lot of suspense leading up to Gail's encounter with her stalker, and this very serious subject is dealt with realistically, though in these more enlightened times, the methods the characters use to handle the problem could be seen as a little outmoded.  Case in point, these days, young women can use such technological advancements as caller i.d. to screen out a lot of these types of calls, but back in 1978, girls were still largely at the mercy of the anonymous males who targeted them via the telephone in such a way.

In addition, ""Are You in the House Alone?"" features a very strong ensemble cast, particularly Blythe Danner (who most will now know as Gwyneth Paltrow's mother) and Tony Bill (of ""Shampoo"") as Gail's parents.  There is even an early appearance by none other than Dennis Quaid (of ""Dreamscape"" and countless other films).

All in all, as I can't resist a good suspense film, ""Are You in the House Alone?"" (which premiered on CBS on September 20, 1978) is perhaps my favorite TV movie of all time.  Although as said, the hairstyles and the lack of current technologies make it inevitably dated, and its essence as a TV movie precludes any explicit language or violence, I still love it for its distinct late '70s atmosphere and strong pacing.  I personally have waited decades for it to be released on DVD, as my only previous way to view it was on an old, now deteriorated second-hand VHS copy.  Scream Factory was wise to give this gem a much-needed new (digital) lease on life, and the picture quality is amazing compared to the degraded tape I was used to.  All in all, an excellent and completely suspenseful and plausible late '70s cultural artifact.

(Final sidenote:  This latest reissue couples the film with another made-for-TV horror movie from 1978, ""the Initiation of Sarah,"" and while I enjoyed that one also, the latter already has a thorough review here on Amazon, and of the two, ""Are You in the House Alone?"" is the one I hold closest to my heart, as I've been a fan of it for ages, so I chose to only tackle the Grauman film in this review.)",1387324800,11,4727,4.61217183770883
5942939,3,B00ESZZOOK,"Before the Lifetime Network and other cable channels began producing original features, the big three (CBS, ABC, and NBC for those born in 1990 or later) had their ""Movies of the Week"" events. Once a week or so, hot actors from the popular shows of the time and semi-retired big-screen stars would appear in a special TV-movie that mirrored the pop culture interests or social issues of the moment. There would be ones about natural disasters, true crimes, and inspirational tales just to name a few subjects.

Shout! Factory's horror imprint takes us back to those glory days with ""Scream Factory Presents TV Terrors."" This DVD double feature includes two movies from 1978 guaranteed to both make you nostalgic for the era and glad it's over all at the same time. The movies highlighted in this collection include ""The Initiation of Sarah"" and ""Are You in the House Alone?!""

""The Initiation of Sarah"" tells the tale of a college freshman (Kay Lenz) with telekinetic powers. She is pressured to join a sorority after her sister (Morgan Brittany) is recruited to a rival chapter run by a group of popular bullies. It just so happens that the house Sarah pledges is run by a witch (Shelley Winters). She wants to use the girl to exact revenge on the daughter (Morgan Fairchild) of the sorority girl that spurned her when she was a student 20 years earlier. Will Sarah give into the temptation to put her and the house mother's tormenting rivals in their place or resist the unrelenting anger brewing within her?

Although it's a bit slow, ""The Initiation of Sarah"" serves up some fun TV-safe scares. I can see this airing the week of Halloween in 1978 and doing quite well in the Nielsen ratings. No one can deny the influence ""Carrie"" had on this movie. Shelley Winters (""The Poseidon Adventure"") effectively plays the creepy old house mother with diabolical plans for the nave Sarah. Morgan Fairchild (""The Seduction"") is perfect as the venomous leader of the mean sorority girls who pick on poor Sarah. Morgan Brittany (""Dallas"") and Kay Lenz (""Moving Violation"") are wonderful as the two sisters torn apart by their rival houses.

In ""Are You in the House Alone?!,"" teenager Gail (Kathleen Beller) begins receiving threatening phone calls and notes. At first, she and her friends believe them to be just cruel pranks. As the calls and letters become more aggressive, she starts fearing for her life. Who is stalking her and why?

I can't begin to tell you how tedious and slow ""Are You in the House Alone?!"" gets towards the end. The last 30 minutes are unbearable. The final six minutes trudged along at a snail's pace that has to be experienced to be believed. It's evident this was meant to be a social statement about rape and encouraging victims to speak out against their attackers. I'm not knocking it and think that's important. However, it would help if the movie didn't cause you to fall asleep before the message is fully delivered. Early appearances by Blythe Danner (""Meet the Parents"") and Dennis Quaid (""Frequency"") makes this a little easier to sit through.

The ""Scream Factory Presents TV Terrors"" Double Feature contains no bonus material. Both movies are presented with Dolby Digital Mono in a Full Frame (1.33:1) aspect ratio. You really can't expect much more since both of these films were made for TV with no expectations of ever being re-broadcast or released several decades later on DVD.

For fans of 1970s and 1980s fright flicks, the ""Scream Factory Presents TV Terrors"" Double Feature will provide some mild and uneven entertainment. You get one relatively decent supernatural film paired with a virtual snore fest that will have you flipping through your Facebook and checking your watch every three minutes or so. Anyone born after 1990 need not apply. Just move along there's nothing to see here.",1386374400,6,3832,4.868098159509202
5942940,5,B00ESZZOOK,"The reviewer before me said that she had seen The Initiation of Sarah, but not Are You in the House Alone.  I'm the other way around, so I'll fill in where that reviewer left off.  As ""Horror movies"" go, Are You in the House Alone isn't all that horrible.  If you are looking for gore and mayhem, look elsewhere.  This is more of a psychological drama where the suspense builds up until the final event.  And this was a tv movie, which means it was not high-budget and/or Oscar material.  Still, I think it's an enjoyable movie with a fairly well-developed plot.  The story is simple; a very pretty high school girl begins to be stalked by someone who calls her and leaves notes in her locker that seem to be threatening.  She becomes increasingly frightened but, due to other circumstances, everyone around her either thinks it's a prank or doesn't have time to listen to her.  Finally, events occur that no one can ignore.  Again, if you're looking for The Shining, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Frankenstein; this is not that kind of suspense movie, so look elsewhere.",1383264000,10,1068,4.632978723404255
5942941,5,B00ESZZOOK,"I haven't seen ARE YOU IN THE HOUSE ALONE, but I've often seen the 1978 TV movie, THE INITIATION OF SARAH. For that film alone, this DVD is worth it.

Yes, The Initiation of Sarah was inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/B00005K3NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>&nbsp;-- but it also surpasses Carrie. For unlike Carrie, The Initiation of Sarah was a TV-movie, hence subject to budgetary and censorial restraints. But it overcame these restraints, even turning them to its advantage by emphasizing story and acting and atmosphere over shocks and gore. It's my personal favorite horror TV-movie, better than the oft-cited and rightly praised&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-Stalker/dp/B00026L7OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night Stalker</a>.

The Initiation of Sarah tells a common tale: A young high school/summer camp/college nerd is long picked on, then finally retaliates. In the horror genre, the nerd often employs supernatural powers, or is severely injured in a ""prank gone bad"" so that he becomes an uberpsycho.

The Initiation of Sarah, like Carrie and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Craft/dp/B001AVMT5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Craft</a>, follows the former pattern. Like Carrie, Sarah (Kay Lenz) has telekinetic powers, which manifest when she's angered. But as she is unable to control its destructive potential, and being a good-hearted nerdy girl, Sarah suppresses her powers.

The film begins with Sarah and her half-sister, Patty (Morgan Brittany), going off to college. Both pledge the campus's elite sorority, ANS (Alpha Nu Sigma), but ANS only accepts the beautiful Patty, not the mousy Sarah. Instead, Sarah joins the brainy PED (Phi Epsilon Delta -- which the svelte ANS girls refer to as Pigs, Elephants, and Dogs).

ANS is led by the beautiful and (rhymes with witch) Jennifer (Morgan Fairchild), who pressures Patty into tormenting Sarah. Meanwhile, the timid Sarah finds new friends at PED, including Allison (Talia Balsom, Martin ""Psycho"" Balsom's daughter, and star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kindred/dp/6300263444/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kindred</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Supernaturals/dp/6300150860/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Supernaturals</a>) and Mouse (Tisa Farrow, Mia's sister, and star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombi-2/dp/B00009WVNT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombi 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthropophagus-The-Grim-Reaper/dp/B000AC7P5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper</a>. Several other cast members (some very minor) are the daughters, nieces, and sisters of famous thesps -- a gimmick employed by the film.

Sarah also comes under the wings of PED's loopy house mother, Mrs. Hunter (Shelley Winters), who teaches ""anthropology and belief systems in primitive cultures."" Naturally, she's also a practicing witch. The evil Satanic kind.

The film follows the usual trajectory. Sarah is rejected and tormented, encouraged to develop and use her powers for revenge, everything finally culminating in a fiery cataclysm. Yet within the framework of its familiar story conventions, the film offers much.

Its strongest asset is Kay Lenz, whose physical appearance, body language, mannerisms, and expressions consistently capture the nuanced timidity of a girl nerd. Consider Sarah maneuvering silently amid the ANS party-goers. In her dowdy cardigan sweater, the 5'1"" Lenz holds herself together, trying to avoid touching anyone as she squeezes past the exuberant taller girls chattering over her. The insecure Sarah strains to be inconspicuous, painfully self-conscious despite the beautiful ANS girls' obliviousness to her. It's a short scene, but The Initiation of Sarah is full of such moments when Lenz shines as Sarah.

The one flaw in Lenz's portrayal is when the ANS girls fling mud and vegetables at Sarah, who stands screaming rather than retreat into the house. But most likely, this was Robert Day's direction. A small mistake, in an overall fine job as director. (No, I don't buy that Sarah was ""too shocked"" to move -- just as I rarely buy that horror's legions of screaming women are too shocked to move whenever a monster lumbers toward them.)

The rest of the cast is competent-to-stellar. Tisa Farrow is best known to horror fans as the star of Zombi 2, yet her portrayal of Mouse is her best horror (or even non-horror) performance. In The Initiation of Sarah, Farrow is less spacey and distant than usual -- infusing Mouse with pain, insecurity, trepidation, despondency, and an occasionally distraught edge (Mouse had attempted suicide).

Morgan Fairchild's Jennifer is a proper (rhymes with witch), more nuanced that most movie/TV  (rhymes with witches), shifting from girlish camaraderie, to coy flirtation, subtle slights, and raw cruelty. Shelley Winters gives a stammering, hyperactive, hammy performance, which is inappropriate against Lenz's realism, but is still mildly fun to watch. Perhaps the celebrated Winters did not think this horror TV-movie was worth a serious effort, but Lenz and Farrow demonstrate that it was.

To fully appreciate The Initiation of Sarah, one should compare it to The Craft (1996), an overrated and inferior film about four nerdy high school girls who employ witchcraft to take vengeance on their (rhymes with witchy) oppressors.

The Craft is a heavy-handed mess, overstated in every way that The Initiation of Sarah is subtle. Both films have stereotypical WASPy blond (rhymes with witch). Yet Morgan Fairchild's Jennifer knows when to withdraw and feign decency. (ANS girls call it ""tact""). Conversely, The Craft's Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor) is openly racist, brazenly calling a black nerd (Rachel True) ""the N word"" in public.

Sorry. Whatever she may say in private, I just don't buy that a sophisticated teenager would publicly shout ""the N word"" in an elite California school in 1996. Maybe in 1956, but not 1996. Even Jennifer, whose film is set in 1978, knows better.

And although Jennifer (like Laura) is vicious, when publicly called on it, Jennifer immediately retreats and says it was ""just a stupid joke."" The Craft eschews such realism. It ""tries too hard"" to establish Laura's villainy (and subsequent reformation). The Craft's heavy-handedness, its stark blacks and whites, ring false. Not a problem in The Initiation of Sarah.

Now compare the nerds. The nerds of PED look like nerds. Dowdy, plain, or overweight. Even the pretty Lenz and Farrow manage, through costuming and body language, to portray proper nerds. Conversely, in The Craft, two of the four nerds (Robin Tunney and Rachel True) are way too attractive to be treated as nerds.

(Of the other two nerds, Fairuza Balk can be pretty, but is effectively distorted by her Goth makeup; and Neve Campbell's nerd passes because of her physical -- and resultant emotional -- injuries).

Despite its big studio theatrical budget, and 1990s special effects, The Craft fails in every way that The Initiation of Sarah succeeds.

(The Initiation of Sarah also compares favorably to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spell/dp/B000BBGV38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spell</a>, yet another TV movie about a tormented nerd girl with telekinetic powers, who is yet again tutored by an elder woman (played by an overbearing Lelia Goldoni, the mousy wife from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unseen/dp/B00DELKA66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unseen</a>)).

The Initiation of Sarah also surpasses the average TV-movie in every area. TV lighting (especially in older TV-movies) tends to be flatter than in cinema, as TV screens display a smaller color palette than does film stock. Despite this, The Initiation of Sarah is especially atmospheric (credit to cinematographer Ric Waite), especially in its murkily-lit photography of the PED sorority house.

The film has some plot holes, or at least raises issues that remain unaddressed (e.g., the fate of Sarah's birth mother; and where is Mr. Hunter?). The classrooms are underpopulated (trying to save money by hiring few extras?). Gore is limited, this being a TV-movie.

Even so, The Initiation of Sarah is an underrated horror gem. An engrossing (if familiar) story, performed by a talented cast. Kay Lenz's portrayal of the nerdy Sarah would alone be enough to make The Initiation of Sarah worth seeing.",1381795200,14,8764,6.095779220779221

Had it been B&W, it might even have added something to the sinister mood of the story. The acting could have been a little better, but Kay Lenz (Sarah) puts in a good performance as she fights evil by doing good; you actually get into the story and feel sorry for her, and you get to hate Jennifer. Those who have been snubbed by a social clique can relate to the theme. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.

8609161,5,B00ESZZOOK,"A DOUBLE BILL OF TONY BILL. Tony is probably more famous for being an award-winning producer (THE STING) than he is an actor. The University of Notre Dame-educated Bill is a gifted actor along with his other creative talents.

In THE INITIATION OF SARAH, he turns in a strong supporting role as the graduate student teacher who falls for the pretty and winsome, but equally mysterious and perplexing, Sarah Goodwin. Sarah is the adopted sister of Patty Goodwin, the equally beautiful and enchanting daughter who is very much favored by their mom (Kathryn Crosby, in a convincing and respectable but way too brief role).

Sorority life is not as pretty when seen from the inside. The viciousness and back-biting are sadly a rite of passage as young women vie to be a member of the most coveted sorority on campus, Alpha Sigma Nu. While Patty is a shoo-in for the snobby sorority led by the always enjoyable and gorgeous, Morgan Fairchild, Sarah is chosen by PED (Phi Epsilon Delta), cruelly referred to as ""Pigs, Elephans and Dogs"" by the snooty sisters of Alpha Sigma Nu.

TIOS has often been referred to as ""Carrie with friends."" Some of that is true. Like Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) in CARRIE of 1976, Sarah is an outcast who is cruelly belittled by those who put her down it seems to only lift themselves and their own personal demons higher. Like Carrie, Sarah has a secret power that eventually she is forced to turn into a deadly weapon. There are major differences, however. Carrie was pushed over the edge of sanity and her tragic revenge was upon one and all. Sarah's revenge was out of her love of her dear friend, Tisa Farrow (a wonderful actress and sister of Mia Farrow). Talia Balsam provides superb support to a stellar cast.

While Carrie destroyed because evil had her too far, Sarah destroys before evil can strike again. Sarah is truly a heroine and a wonderful ""friend"" to know and love. I especially love the way she loves her sister, Patty, and Patty truly loves Sarah. When Patty says nothing can come between them after Hell Night, she means it. It is redeeming to know that a character truly is what she appears to be: good-hearted and with only the best of intentions toward those whom she loves, namely Sarah.

In ARE YOU IN THE HOUSE ALONE?, Tony Bill turns in a terrific performance along with Kathleen Beller and Blythe Danner. They convey the sense of a real family and a real family who faces the most traumatic of crises: the rape of their teenage daughter by a perp who happens to be close enough to convince the police that it wasn't rape at all. A viewer can feel Tony and Blythe's outrage as well as the pain and suffering of Kathleen, who turns in a subtle, beautifully nuanced performance as a young woman transformed by very unfortunate circumstances.

I give this DVD version a straight five stars for its entertainment value as well as its powerful statements about love, tested and true, and how compassion, belief, and solidarity stand strong in the face of adversity, no matter how heartbreaking the outcome. These are two TV movies that deserved to be preserved. May a whole new generation of fans wake up to the genius that was TV in the 1970s. These are not inferior tales or standard TV fare that is often the case today. These are truly memorable, touching tales that teach us that to strive to be better as individuals is to strive to be better to others. The powerful impact of these ""TV Terrors"" will stay with you and hopefully make you think twice before you judge, belittle or dismiss another human being because it seems like the easier path to take.",1427414400,2,3608,4.647335423197492
