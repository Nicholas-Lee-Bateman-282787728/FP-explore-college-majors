7998529,2,B0000CAPZW,"This movie was a B-Rated movie to me.  Many of the actors and actresses were no name and their speaking was not realistic.  Especially Frank.  His acting was just amatuer and really bad.  Silas wasn't too bad but needed work.  The pyrotechnics were bad also especially from their guns.  The soundtrack was fantastic though.  The movie could have been a major player if the acting was better.  The storyline was a little unusual to follow if you didn't see it from the beginning.  For future guidelines, they should follow the regular trend and keep to actors and actresses that can speak their lines with a bit more realism to it instead of sounding like they are reading from a book and trying to make it look real like a bad video scene from the Jerry Springer Show.",1005004800,,768,4.547445255474453
