2843,4,0615544266,"Caught this on PBS earlier this year and thought that this would be a perfect christmas gift for my mother who hasn't been back to Korea since we left a couple months after I was born. My mom did make fun of Marja from time to time when they went back to her kitchen in new york and tried to make the dishes, but she really did like it when they were in Korea and touring around the food markets and what not. For me, it was nice to see the bevy of different dishes she used to make for us when I was child (the seaweed soup was my favorite along with kimchi of course). She really enjoyed it b/c she lives with my dad nowadays in a place where there aren't any korean people and it was something that allowed her to see homeland which she really liked.",1356480000,3,753,4.026666666666666

2845,5,0615544266,"My girlfriend, who became interested in Korean food, caught some of Kimchi Chronicles on Public TV.  Suffice it to say, she had to have the series. What we received was not merely a foodie's delight, but an interesting melange of Korean history, personal journey, travel documentary, comedy, and, quite unexpectedly, hang out sessions with Hugh Jackman who serves, at times, as narrator as well as companion discovering Korean food. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who happens to be the host's husband, helps with some of the cooking. I found it particularly fascinating seeing him make observations about how Korean food  breaks the fundamental rules of his traditional French cuisine and somehow comes together in ways ways that his culinary training can't account for. You'll see Marja cooking with for her family and friends after visits to a variety of sites in Korea.",1333670400,4,873,5.228571428571429

This is a very entertaining series. I lived in Korea for 3 years and my wife is Korean and we love to watch these episodes. She literally gets hungry watching such great food being prepared and I enjoy the story lines that accompany each episode. I can relate to the bi-racial theme and think it is great to see such a wonderful global mix of cultures presented here.",1333584000,,518,6.109589041095891

7788168,4,0615544266,"I originally caught an episode of this series on PBS.  It peaked my interest, and so I decided to buy it.  Very interesting, though at points it was just more about name dropping than about the culture.  I understand it was a cultural adventure through the palette, but it was lacking.  I didn't hate the show, but it was lacking.",1363305600,,330,4.45
7788169,4,0615544266,"Beautiful cinematography and entertaining script make this short series a win.  If you are hungry, don't watch this because it will just make it worse.

The series reminds me of Anthony Bourdain's no reservations, except replacing Bourdain with Marja, a striking half-Korean half-African-American narrator and host of the show, who-considering the entirety of the series-seems to place a lot of emphasis on her back-to-my-roots in a way that seems a tad narcy, but doesn't spoil the entertainment.  Her husband plays his cards close to the vest, one could almost say he's a passive bystander to Marja's strong girl-power personality.  But when the couple competes in the kitchen, Marja tends to make simpler, yet practical traditional Korean things, while Jean-George reminds us that he's a badass French chef by discovering-along with the audience-the true essence of a uniquely Korean ingredient by experimenting with it to yield very impressive results.  At first they seem like a really odd international couple, but in the kitchen you clearly see the rapport and it's a welcome treat to the feast of sensations in their culinary exploration.

This is a great introduction to Korean food and culture, for Americans unlike myself who probably don't know anything about the culture or cuisine because they live in a small town that doesn't have a single Korean restaurant or large Korean population.  West coasters probably will think this is still entertaining, if they like cooking and travel shows.

As a supplemental to KimChi chronicles, you should check out this wonderful, engaging and hilarious Korean lady, Maangchi's blog: [...] It is an incredible resource for making banchan and traditional Korean meals with items available in the US. Sorry to promote her blog in a review for a similar thing, but this really is a compelling resource and I'm just trying to be helpful.",1361836800,,1884,5.194719471947194
7788170,3,0615544266,"I got  a bad DVD, i guess (hope they all aren't bad). Tried in two players and it skipped chapters in both of them. Used on my PC and could access the skipped chapters manually.

So for  $18 dollars I was disappointed with the quality but not the content. The recipes are fantastic (I bought the book) and the knowledge about Korean food that I gained are irreplaceable. Hugh Jackman was a pleasant surprise to see and hear as well.

I intended to cook nearly every one of these dishes at least once.",1361577600,,500,4.344086021505376
