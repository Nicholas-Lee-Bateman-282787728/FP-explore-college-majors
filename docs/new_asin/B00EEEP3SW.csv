8604721,5,B00EEEP3SW,"I love both these movies. I bought this for ""For a Few Dollars More"", my favorite of the three Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. This 2-movie box set was less expensive than the one movie alone. I just wish ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" could have also been included.",1527984000,,272,4.46

8604724,4,B00EEEP3SW,"Great movies, the movies get 5 stars.  I saw them originally at a drive in theater so it brings back memories of a time when Rawhide's star (Clint) stepped onto the big screen for the first time and blew us all away (along with several bad guys). The Blu-ray isn't as good as I hoped, it is a little grainy in parts, so I removed one star,  but it's the best copy I've seen so far, and it is worth the low price I paid. Blu-rays don't scratch as easily as DVDs do, so I got it used at a low price, and it was in great shape.",1412812800,,524,3.8425925925925926
8604725,5,B00EEEP3SW,"previous review incorrect - although other menu options appear to be grayed out, they are actually accessible - so the disks do include chapters, options, and extras! well worth the inexpensive price you can grab a used one for.",1410134400,,228,4.871794871794871
