8202035,5,B000ROAMDY,I liked Bump in the Night more than the other movie in this double feature.,1482278400,,75,4.066666666666666
8202036,4,B000ROAMDY,"Bump in The Night is amazing. It's a fever dream of mad divorced woman turned into a made for TV film. What passes for reality in this world is a drunk terrible mother trying to solve crimes based on complete wild guesses while male authority figures stand in awe of her. She then of course drinks more. She has too. No one appreciates her Pulitzer prize winning ways and leaves her. Of course that just gonna be driving her to drink more.

Seriously, the whole movie is like that. It's hilarious how self centered the old drunk is while her kids off about to get man handled by Christopher Reeve in a disconcertingly good performance as a child molester. It's also an interesting proto-3rd wave feminist track. All men are evil and only want to have sex with you. Her only true friend is a fellow under appreciated female drunk. Any woman not centered on their female self is helping child molesting pornographers. The men in this movie are all authority figures in disrepair. Incapable of anything other than simpering in her awesome presence.

It'd all be insufferable if it weren't for the steady direction from some TV director who I didn't recognize and some fantastic performances from the whole cast. Wings Hauser sells his character way more than he needs to. Did I watch this solely for Wings? Yes. Was he worth it? Yes. He is the best man playing a sad house wife ever complete in a Jason Bourne ugly sweater.

It's not a great film in the classic sense. It's fun. It sucks at it's politics. It's humorous on accident. Essential ingredients to fun viewings",1472515200,,1567,4.629496402877698
8202037,5,B000ROAMDY,I bought this for Bird of Prey. Lesley Ann Warren is jaw-dropping in it! Great (sophisticated) storyline. Very gripping! Loved it!,1440979200,,130,5.238095238095238
8202038,4,B000ROAMDY,"I bought this DVD for Christopher Reeve because I love him...  He's just so good in everything he did...  I was actually glad the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be... like I mean, it wasn't ""graphic"".  He was good.... I don't really like it when he plays bad guys, but he's so beautiful, I want to watch it anyway...

I never watched the other movie.  I didn't bother...",1430784000,,381,4.236111111111111
8202039,5,B000ROAMDY,"I bought this DVD for Bump in the Night only.  I will not be commenting on the other film.  Bump in the Night is a 1991 made-for-TV movie about a pedophile kidnapping an eight year old boy and his mother's frantic, relentless efforts to find him.  Meredith Baxter-Birney gives a great performance as an alcoholic reporter whose fame and drinking has driven her husband away.  (He comes back and supports her search for their son).  Christopher Reeve is both pathetic and vile as the pedophile who thinks he will be ""loving"" his victim.  The DVD is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1430697600,,587,4.81
8202040,5,B000ROAMDY,"A made for TV movie from 1991, Christopher Reeve plays a bad guy very well.  He had a broader scope of great talent than I thought.  An exceptional thriller, he takes a boy and the mother (Baxter) pulls out all the stops as she pursues the finding of her son.  A fast-moving, well-plotted film I could not stop watching.  Have not seen ""Bird of Prey"".",1428624000,,351,4.3538461538461535
8202041,5,B000ROAMDY,This was a great movie.  I neaver seen this movie with Christopher reeve before.  Thank you,1428192000,,91,4.625
8202042,3,B000ROAMDY,"First of all, this DVD is two movies on one disc, not two discs, as advertised.  Secondly, it is in Full Screen format, not Widescreen.

The sound quality of this disc is very poor and uneven, especially on BIRD OF PREY.  My hearing is not very good, and there are no closed captions.  I was constantly turning the volume up and down -- up, so I could hear the dialogue, then down because the music was too loud.  The setting was in Bulgaria, and the foreign accents made it even harder to understand.  (In places where the dialogue was in Bulgarian, they did at least have the translation in English subtitles).

BUMP IN THE NIGHT was much better in sound quality, although there were still no closed captions.  The acting was quite good, especially Meredith Baxter-Birney, who played an alcoholic whose son was kidnapped.",1281484800,3,823,4.666666666666667
