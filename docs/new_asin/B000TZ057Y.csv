8366820,4,B000TZ057Y,"This DVD has some great footage on it from World War II. This is a collection of United News newsreels that would have appeared before a movie at the theater. Could you imagine going to watch Iron Man at the theater (summer of 2008!!!) and seeing news instead of a preview for the next Will Ferrell film!!!

The first section was great with the movement of Germany through Europe. There are real images of tanks, planes and battleships.  With lines like 'There is no place in a civilized world for Germany' though you know it is the American perspective of the war.",1189900800,,565,4.529411764705882
