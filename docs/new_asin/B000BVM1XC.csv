2442557,4,B000BVM1XC,"I remember this show when it was on in 1967.  It was from the creators of the ""Dick Van Dyke Show,"" and was similar in many ways.  Instead of a TV show, it was a morning drive radio show.  One of the partners was married to a pretty wife, the other was a bachelor trying to get fixed up (sounds like Laura Pettrie (Mary Tyler Moore) and Sally Rogers (Rose Marie).  Goldie Hawn is the next door neighbor, nosey, like Millie Helper.  Billy de Wolfe is the station manager who constantly bothers Ronnie Shell, just like Buddy and Mel (Maury Amsterdam and Richard Deacon).  This show was funny and quick with the jokes and puns.  I loved it then and am enjoying it just as much today.",1176249600,2,680,4.307086614173229
2442558,5,B000BVM1XC,"Even my wife, who is not generally a fan of sitcoms sat through this with me and is still raving about it! I went to the trouble of compiling a detailed episode guide for this show as I had never seen it before. The Ronnie Schell interview is fantastic and very informative. The Trivia Game is excellent.

The writing and performances are first rate and the guest stars include:

Leslie Parrish, David Ketchum, Herb Vigran,Charlie Brill, Marty Ingels, Andy Griffith and Carl Reiner, Herbie Faye, Pat Harrington, Johnny Silver,Jackie Joseph (as Cousin Bibian), Ric Roman, Byron Morrow, Don Diamond, Peter Hobbs, Robert Donner, Jan Murray, Angelique Pettyjohn, Herb Edelman, Lynda Day George, Jerry Van Dyke, Simon Oakland, Jayne Meadows, E.J.Peaker.

As for the regular performers, the standout aside from Ronnie,Joby Baker and Goldie Hawn, must surely be Billy De Wolfe. What a treasure, he even has a special episode drawn from his real life episode 11. Where Have You Been Billy Boy, Billy Boy? which is my wife's favorite!

Buy it.",1169856000,11,1034,5.029239766081871
2442559,1,B000BVM1XC,"I have never felt compelled to write a review and had never heard of ""Good Morning, World,"" but I bought the discs because the program sounded interesting. My set just arrived, and I was greatly dismayed to learn of the inexcusably shoddy packaging. First, the discs are stacked on top of each other so that you have to take Disc Two out to get Disc One out and have to remove Disc Three to get to Disc Four. (This is very annoying but somewhat common.) Second, the grasping mechanism that holds the discs in place is so tight that you need to really bend each disc uncomfortably close to the point of breaking it to get it out of the box.(I plan to put the discs in jewel boxes.) Third, there is absolutely no description of the episodes on or in the packing. I did pop in Disc Two, and there was a listing of episodes but no description of them.

I did go to S'more entertainment's website and saw product alerts that the content on Disc 4 of ""Mister Peppers"" was the same as the Disc 2 content and that the ""Lotsa Luck"" DVD inadvertently lacked the promised pilot episode. The company did offer to remedy those problems but honestly does not seem to check things out closely enough before placing them in the stream of commerce.",1163635200,2,1231,4.399122807017544
2442560,5,B000BVM1XC,"I vividly remember watching this show with my family when it originally aired. It was bright, edgy, genuinely funny and Billy DeWolf could deliver a line like no one else (with the possible exception of Paul Lynde!) When I saw it was becoming available on DVD I felt a mixture of joy at being able to see it again, and fear that it would be one of those nostalgia pieces best left in it's own era. Let me assure you, it's a treasure. The characters are well drawn and engaging, and the writing is smart. But what makes this a home run for me is the treatment. S'more entertainment has done a beautiful job on these episodes. The colors and sound are crisp and clear, and if you are someone who has been burned by DVD collections where the quality was godawful, this is one time you can buy with peace of mind. This is truly one of the best TV series on DVD. I thank the producers for taking the risk on a show few might remember and for giving it the treatment of which other shows would be jealous.",1140220800,15,999,4.2356020942408374
2442561,5,B000BVM1XC,"Here's yet another ""lost"" television situation comedy that, thankfully, has made its way to DVD.  ""Good Morning World"" ran on CBS in the 1967-68 season and, unfortunately, was up against ""NYPD"" on ABC and ""Tuesday Night at the Movies"" on NBC.  In an interview included on disc 1, series co-star Ronnie Schell observes that ""Tuesday Night at the Movies"" was broadcast before the days of multiple movie channels on cable television and that ""Good Morning World"" couldn't compete with the likes of Cary Grant.  As a result, ""Good Morning World"" was never among the top twenty shows and was promptly cancelled after its one year run of 26 episodes.  A number of the writers and production people who worked on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" also worked on ""Good Morning World,"" elevating it above many of the other sitcoms of the day.  This is the show that gave Goldie Hawn her start on television, but the other regular cast members - Schell, Joby Baker, Billy DeWolfe, and Julie Parrish are all fine and obvious comparisons with ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" can be made.  In particular, the relationship between Schell and DeWolfe will remind one of the characters Buddy Sorell (Morey Amsterdam) and Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon) from the Van Dyke show, and Baker and Parrish are the ""surrogates"" for Rob and Laura Petrie.

As was the case with their previous TV-on-DVD releases (""Mister Peepers"" and ""Lotsa Luck!""), S'more Entertainment has done a great job in bringing this series to DVD.  The episodes look reasonably crisp for an early color series that's nearly 40 years old and the audio is fine, save for an occasional dropout.  There are also a few extras included on this DVD set, chief among them being the interview with Ronnie Schell which I would recommend watching before proceeding to the episodes; it's informative and provides a nice context for the show.

Fans of ""Good Morning World"" who watched the series back in the late 1960s will be happy to see this release, and those who are discovering it for the first time, particularly ""crossover"" fans of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" are likely to enjoy the humor that's delivered by a fine ensemble cast.",1139443200,14,2154,4.813008130081301
2442562,4,B000BVM1XC,I remember watching this show every week in the 60's and loving it.  Very reminiscent of the Dick Van Dyke Show about a pair of disc jockeys (Joby Baker and Ronnie Schell) and their home lives with Leslie Parrish and Goldie Hawn.  The wonderful Billy de Wolfe stole every episode as their prissy boss.  Amazed that this 'one season wonder' will be available on DVD but I'm loving it already!,1130630400,12,391,4.557142857142857

2442576,5,B000BVM1XC,"I should have posted this review right after I watched all of the episodes which I think I watched in record time, something like a week.  As everyone has already said, this sit-com is from the producers of the Dick Van Dyke show and for that reason alone it is a safe buy.  The ensemble cast is great.  Situations can be somewhat ridiculous as this was the 60's let's not forget.  Anyway I remember watching many of these episodes growing up and enjoyed them immensely.  Really glad I ordered this.",1405641600,3,499,4.5

2442580,4,B000BVM1XC,"An enjoyable show that seems like a post-script for The Dick Van Dyke Show, and a forerunner to WKRP, only with the soundtrack intact. The actors are all familiar from their appearances on other '60's fare, and play well off eachother; included are cameo appearances by Carl Reiner and Andy Griffith. The modern interview with Ronnie Schell is a big plus, and it's great to see a 1967 interview of Ronnie (known at the time for his character of Pvt. Duke Slater on Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.) and newcomer Goldie Hawn, together, promoting Good Morning World. My favorite episode is the last one, from 1968, where Schell's dog gets boss Billy DeWolf's dog in trouble.",1368230400,,659,4.7894736842105265
2442581,3,B000BVM1XC,"To put it bluntly, this is NOT a funny show.  They tried their hardest to make it work.  But the scripts were just too juvenile and.....well......just not funny.  But it was good to see these people again.  I remember them well.....and fondly.",1361059200,6,243,4.714285714285714
2442582,5,B000BVM1XC,"A series created before its time.  Funny, but in a very 1960's kind of way.  While it is too bad there was only one season, shows do get a little repetitive. It had great potential but you could tell it was censored by the time. Joby Baker and Ronnie Schell are great actors. If you want to see a young (and really very talented) Goldie Hawn, buy!  If you like obscure TV from the mid-60's, buy! And buy if you collect Joby Baker (a fantastic actor that is not well known and should have been!)",1357171200,6,494,4.178947368421053
2442593,4,B000BVM1XC,"I had never had seen the show before now, but it's actually a pretty funny show!  I would recommend it to anyone who liked the sitcoms from the 60's and 70's.",1344470400,,158,4.096774193548387
2442594,5,B000BVM1XC,Without a doubt this was a very good purchase!  This was a very funny series from the 60's.  The DVD's are crystal clear(both sound & picture).  The stars of this show really shined!  I would recommend this set for real TV historians.  Don't miss this one!,1332288000,,256,4.478260869565218
2442595,5,B000BVM1XC,"Never heard of this show before until I saw it here at Amazon, and being a huge fan of classic TV I took a chance on this set (plus the price $3.48 for the whole set made my decision a lot easier). Now, to be honest, at first I wasn't to thrill about it but as I kept watching the show it started growing on me, the plots while a tad silly were very enjoyable and fun to watch, before I knew I was watching one episode after the other and enjoying every one of them. I must also add that this set is very well done with the image being quiet good: clean, clear picture with strong, vibrant colors. There's an occasional scratch or dirt speck, but overall, it's very good. While by no means a forgotten classic, ""Good Morning, World"" is a good solid little show that deserved a few more years on TV.",1331337600,2,798,4.121794871794871
2442596,5,B000BVM1XC,"This is an enjoyable short lived t.v. series.  One of the characters names is LARRY CLARK. Hey, that is my

the nude resort episode.",1292716800,,238,3.9166666666666665
2442597,4,B000BVM1XC,"A nice ""safe"" and funny show.
Hey, you'll see Carl Reiner's name in it.
Ronnie Schell and Goldie Hawn are very good in this.
The rest of the cast does a fine job as well.

Ronnie Schell, where did you go?

Considering this series is from the late 60's, the print is clean and bright.
No extras, but who cares?
A good value.",1284940800,2,323,4.111111111111111

2442599,5,B000BVM1XC,i have watched around six of the shows so far an they are what i thought not the gratest show but not bad either has a lot of laughs,1258329600,,132,3.586206896551724
2442600,4,B000BVM1XC,"I used to watch this on CBS back when I was in 9th grade.  It reminded me of The Dick van Dyke Show-the early years.  I say that because of the episode called ""100 Terrible Hours"" in which Rob Petrie was a DJ tryibg to break an endurance record.  GMW is similar in the fact of two DJs just trying to make a living.  One of them is married to a wife who also reminds me of a young Laura Petrie. It is a shame it was in a bad time slot or else it would of gone on longer.",1242432000,,469,3.66
2442601,4,B000BVM1XC,"The 26 half-hour episodes of the situation comedy ""Good Morning World"" were originally broadcast by CBS during its 1967-68 season. Many of those who tuned in to see the premiere of ""Laugh-In"" in the fall of 1968 did so to see Goldie Hawn who had already developed a cult following from playing the Lewis' ditzy neighbor Sandy Kramer on ""Good Morning World"".

Dave and Linda Lewis were a married couple played by Joby Baker and Julie Parrish much in the vein of the Petrie's from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"". Not a big surprise as both shows were produced and developed by Carl Reiner and Sheldon Leonard. Dave was also coupled with bachelor Larry Clarke (Ronnie Schell who viewers already knew as Gomer Pyle's friend Duke Slater) as an early-morning drive time Los Angeles radio DJ team known as (big surprise) ""Lewis and Clarke"". Think 1960's ""WKRP"" with funny voices, silly chatter, and general on-air antics between songs and commercials.

The show followed the home and office lives of this ""sort of"" wacky pair; mixing elements of their personal lives in with bits involving their overbearing boss, station manager Roland B. Hutton (Billy DeWolfe).

The series was a few years ahead of its time and the basic formula would be more successful a few years later as ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". MTM's famous ""Teddy Awards"" was a tribute to ""Golden Mikey Awards"" featured on ""Good Morning World"".

Good writing and excellent performances make it well worth watching.

2442602,5,B000BVM1XC,"One of my favorite TV flops, and we all have them shows that that should have been hits but were not, is the 1967 series ""Good Morning World."" It featured Joby Baker and Julie Parrish as a young married couple in Los Angeles. Joby is David Lewis an early morning DJ on the popular radio show Lewis and Clark. Clark is Larry Clark played by Ronnie Schell. Larry is a confirmed bachelor but mostly dates the loveable, daffy neighbor Sandy played by Goldie Hawn in her first series. I know it was her next series, ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In"", in 1968 and her Oscar win in ""Cactus Flower"" that brought her more fame but it was really ""Good Morning World"" that started her on the road to superstardom. The great Billy DeWolfe plays Dave and Larry's boss at the radio station. Billy DeWolfe is a scene stealer without trying. He is that good. In one episode he gets a laugh just by asking the question ""Having a drink of water?"" Why is that funny? Because it is asked in Billy DeWolfe's style.

The cast had charm and were very funny.  It deserved to be a big hit.",1180915200,6,1060,4.375634517766497
8093065,5,B000BVM1XC,One of my favorite sit-coms from the 60s.  Never understood why this classic ran only one season.  Billy DeWolfe was the best and Ronnie Schell & Joby Baker made a great pair.  Also puzzling is why their careers never took off after this show.,1523318400,,243,4.4772727272727275

The program ran on CBS Tuesday night right after the very popular Red Skelton Show but failed to receive good ratings.
The plots are simple, the humor typical of that era's sitcom. It is a very clean, harmless,but predictable program. The acting is also typical for 69 s sitcoms.  When on screen veteran actor Billy De Wolfe steals the show.

I would have liked to see a season two but Schell comments on the extras that the producer's had some issues with Baker and Parrish and that combined with low ratings they decided to let the show go. It's well known that the Van Dyke show was facing cancellation after it's first year but Leonard, Thomas and the sponsor Procter & Gamble interceded with CBS to get a renewal, I think Good Morning World had the potential to go further.",1486944000,3,899,4.487804878048781
