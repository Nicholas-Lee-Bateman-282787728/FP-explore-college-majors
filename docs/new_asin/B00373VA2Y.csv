4080211,5,B00373VA2Y,"Scott Walker is a figure more talked about than heard for many music lovers. As a fan of the 4AD record label, I heard Walker's name come up again and again, whether it was as the inspiration for Brendan Perry's vocals or the aesthetic of Cocteau Twins bassist Simon Raymonde (whose father Ivor recorded Walker's youthful music). Walker himself was signed to this very label at the age of 60. After Walker released his album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Drift/dp/B000EZMPEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Drift</a>&nbsp;in 2006, I felt the time was right to finally encounter this musician, but I wanted some historical background on the Walker phenomenon. The documentary 30 CENTURY MAN is a good way to quickly get up to speed.

The film is divided into two parts. The first is the story of Walker's career and the effect it had on musicians who worked with him and who listened to the albums he released. Artist interviews include members of Radiohead, Sting, David Bowie, Simon Raymonde, Allison Goldfrapp, and Jarvis Cocker. There's a great deal of archival interview footage with Walker from the 1960s through the 1980s. The second part consists of scenes from the recording of THE DRIFT. Here one can see how Walker created some of the bizarre sonorities on the record, for example having workmen construct an elaborate wooden structure just to get the precise slamming sound he wanted. Much of THE DRIFT is piercing noise of uncertain origin, but the documentary gives you an idea of the instrumental forces used. It's remarkable how humble a musician Scott Walker comes across as in the interviews, absolutely sure of his aesthetic direction but very understanding that it won't be everyone's cup of tea. While not the nutty recluse that some suspected he was, Walker still clearly likes his privacy, but he opens up enough that the viewer feels a deepened understanding of his work.",1245283200,36,1942,5.244372990353698

4080213,5,B00373VA2Y,"There are much more fully realized, and comprehensive, reviews than this one will be. But I am Reviewing this DVD as someone who has come late to Scott Walker's solo career, and although aware of the Walker Brothers as a child of the 60's, as a tween, and a teenager, I only really knew the Walker Bothers from their single successes, here in the States. So, I am certainly no long-standing fan, nor a Scott Walker affeciando.

Having said that, I may certainly be one in the making. As I type this, Scott Walker is 70 years old, and counting. I just turned 60 myself, in July of 2012. I am extremely impressed with the trajectory of this highly individualitic, and determined artist. Seldom have I come across an artist that has the length, breadth, and expanse, of Scott Walker, and I'm sure that there probably won't be many more, if ever. Even as Scott Walker is revealed within this absolutely fascinating documentary, you know that barely a whisper has actually been given. Scott has defied all the odds, and continues to follow his own vision, not caring if his own latter day career is something that anyone else will like, much less understand, he is just compelled to do it. In that way, Scott Walker very much is a ""30th Century Man""; at turns highly private, enormously intelligent, and an artist that flys in the face of both wanting, or needing ""popularity"", and neatly pretty much eshewing it all together. Try doing THAT in such a competetive environment as that of the music industry. After watching this DVD, I was thoroughly interested in both the man, and his music. Scott's ""music"" may have changed, in ways almost incomprehensible, but his magnetism, certainly hasn't changed, as witnessed by all the other artists he has had such an influence on, in his mysterious wake. Thank God there are artists left such as Scott Walker, and that he continues to ""speak"" to those of us interested enough to listen, and to follow him; but always on his own terms. And I am....................

4080214,5,B00373VA2Y,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, i have always been a fan of his and the walker brothers having several recordings.i found Scott to be a very intelligent man and very complex. Surprisingly I found him rather friendly and interesting.

the movie interviews were a plus sign for the artist nothing really bad said about Scott. The only thing i wished they would have done is more info on his personnel life was he married,kids etc. Maybe he would not have done the film if this was in the script.

It was kind of interesting to see him as a pop singer than I guess as an avante garde singer and composer.

very interesting film kudos for it.",1327795200,2,644,4.440677966101695
4080215,5,B00373VA2Y,"Yeah, listen to his music, it IS from the future!  If you are interested in art, in music, in film, then this is something that you need to watch, period.  Maybe you will get into his music, maybe not, but if you want to challenge yourself, expand your boundaries beyond what your parameters currently are, check this out.  Hey, this is only because I care man.",1324425600,2,361,4.4393939393939394
4080216,5,B00373VA2Y,"I must preface this review by being honest, I was not a huge Scott Walker fan prior to watching ""30 Century Man"". The only one of his albums that I owned before watching this documentary was ""Scott 3"", which I didn't dislike, but overall didn't knock my socks off after a few listens. However, as has happened often in my music listening life, I had a feeling that Scott Walker was the sort of artist I would really begin to understand and become a fan of when the right time in my life presented itself. I was correct, and that moment came after I watched ""30 Century Man"". I had a similar experience over a 15 year period with Tom Waits; I tried to get into his music at a fairly young age and hated it, but sure enough, I own all his albums now and went through a period of a little over a year where I barely listened to anything but Waits' music. Ironically, I can think of very few musicians whose careers have followed the pattern of Waits and Walker: both started their music careers by making mainstream music (much more so in Walker's case than Waits'), but ended up breaking from their more commercial roots and making music influenced by Jacques Brel and the avant garde. The Scott Walker story presented in ""30 Century Man"" will be fascinating to any music fan: here is a man who was in a ""boy band"" in the 60's which was HUGE, went solo and did four albums on his own, only to become convinced by record company executives and/or his management that he needed to release commercial material to satisfy his fan base after following his muse for four albums, made albums he didn't care for for a few years, and then saw a reunion of the boy band that he had broken away from, only to unleash some of his most uncompromising material on their final album. This started a trend of Walker releasing unconventional and certainly not commercial albums sporadically that has continued to this day. (When I say this is rare, I mean it. For example, can you imagine Nick Lachey or Justin Timberlake releasing albums like Walker has when they're his age? I can't either.) One of the funniest moments in this documentary is Brian Eno's statement about the last Walker Brothers album ""Nite Flights"", where he states that Walker's contributions to the album were not only unprecedented at the time, but have not been topped by any of the bands that have come since, including the Talking Heads. I also found the interview segments with Walker to be very revealing, as well as the clips of him in the studio having various contraptions built for the recording of his most recent album ""The Drift"". The interviews revealed Walker to be a down to earth human being, certainly one who is not fond of the spotlight, but one who believes in his muse wholeheartedly and follows it wherever it takes him without question. That is the mark of a true artist in my opinion; not success, not monetary gain, not fame, but the belief in yourself to be true to your heart. After watching this documentary, I purchased Walker's entire catalogue, and am a few albums into the listening experience as I write this. It is an unorthodox, but ultimately rewarding ride to these open ears.",1320624000,4,3167,4.54816112084063
4080217,5,B00373VA2Y,"I have been listening to Scott Walker for many years and it is certainly not a stretch to say, that in terms of pure vocal ability and interpretive skill, he could be considered the finest male vocalist of the pop era. This documentary-style DVD fills in a lot of what has been missing (for the general public, at least) from Scott's complete story. I found the performance clips, especially from the 60's, to be worth the price of the video alone. Walker, although a self-proclaimed nervous performer (and in several performances you can actually see his hands shaking), performs with a  kind of cool sophistication that you rarely saw pop singers display in that era.  The 2006 interview with Scott, which is the focal point of this DVD, is very revealing and paints a picture of an artist who, although steadfast in his vision relative to his art, has paid a very high price for that vision.  In my opinion, some of the peripheral characters in the DVD are, quite frankly, insignificant to this effort (particularly the insignifcant Marc Almond and syncophant David Bowie, who always manages to make anything and everything he talks about ""all about him""). That being said, the reverence and respect that artists like Johnny Marr, Gavin Friday, and Jarvis Cocker speak of Scott with is what gives the film its emotional power. Most impressive is Brian Eno. His insightful commentary on everything from contemporary music criticism to music/commerce/marketplace contradictions to his own acute observations and assessments of Scott's work are priceless. This is a must see for anyone who still believes in artists like Walker who are, quite literally, willing to give everything for their art.",1270425600,9,1695,5.02491103202847
4080218,5,B00373VA2Y,"Highly recommend this definitive tribute to the brilliant singer-producer, Scott Walker. It takes time to understand how an artist develops throughout his life by taking necessary risks and perhaps delving into non-traditional paths, as Scott did. Yes, I think it was highly intuitive, the way he emerged in different artistic forms, styles, and within conceptual variances. He would know.

Walker has revealed honestly his motives and intent throughout the years; for those of us who followed him closely. We wanted to stand by him, through ""thick or thin."" The artist credo, pursuit of the exceptionnel...even while he experimented with the nuances in voice, crescendo, theme, and language shifts. He understood the intricacies, and stayed the course as a major artist.

Perhaps, there was a ""time warp"" for Scott Walker, an isolation. He understood the full range of his voice, production expertise, producer mantle, and he took full strides into vocal and orchestral arrangements that would be considered alien to another established artist: but to him, it was familiar ground, within his bold exploration of other musical compositions.

I am indebted to him as an artist. Grateful his accomplishments were captured, sur ce point.",1264982400,3,1234,5.383419689119171
4080219,5,B00373VA2Y,"I was a huge fan of Walker Brothers in my teenage era. Especially Scott. I spent my last yen to go to see him when he did Solo Tour in Japan in late 60s. Then I got busy worring about day to day living and forgot about Scott. 40 years later, this video reconnected me to Scott and his awesome new stuff he is creating. Very interesting!!! So happy to know that he is alive and pretty much active and even better! Still looks almost as cute as he was 40 years ago.",1251849600,4,463,3.989247311827957
4080220,5,B00373VA2Y,"The subject is American, but his pre-eminence is strictly European. Fans of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" should remember Patsy's older sister claiming she was the subject of a Scott Walker song; fans of director Minghella's first (and best) film ""Truly Madly Deeply"" (comedy-tragedy-ghost story: deserves own eventual blog) should remember the woman and her ghostly dead lover singing a raucous cover of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"" while fans of oldskool retro-60's classics on classics radio should recall ""Make It Easy On Yourself"" plus many anthemic others done with the same sonorous baritone over an orchestral sweeping vista.

The film is ""30 Century Man"" and the subject is Scott Walker. Once upon a time in the 1960's, three typical tall, skinny Sunset Strip denizens with long hair and bangs past their eyebrows plus failed C.V.s as musicians moved to England, wherein the intrinsic lack of tall, skinny Sunset Strip denizens with bangs past their eyebrows would allow them to actually stand out. And they did, to eventual mega-stardom. Precursors of the Ramones' hat trick, these unrelated chums named themselves the Walker Brothers, surrendered to mainstream pop, and had enormous hit after enormous hit there, with their flagship sound of Scott Walker's baritone crooning. However mushy the MOR slop tended to be, at least it was interesting having ""one of our own"" youth culturers singing this way, and all three looking so shaggable. Believe me, David Bowie was listening INTENTLY to this particular sound, and you can hear it every concert he sings to this day.

Huge hits written by the era's best other songwriters, genuine Beatles-esque fan mobbing, compromises, breakdowns, supstance abuse, what photographer/director Larry Clark called ""the usual betrayals in the music biz,"" then it gets weird. Prettiest boy and main voice Scott derails, joins a monestary, emerges as a Jacques Brel interpreter, then a techno-artist songwriter before there actually is techno, then avant-garde orchestrator cum performance artist for music that has no categorizing description, all of which he warbles the highest brow intellectual themes over. He releases his work maybe once a decade. This is the story of Scott Walker, a man rightly called the most enigmatic figure ever in the history of popular music, depicted from infancy to 2006 in ""30 Century Man.""

Director Steven Kijak gives us ""listening heads"" instead of the talking variety, what with David Bowie coming aboard, Radiohead, Brian Eno and others chatting about Walker's influence upon their own work. Even 60's compatriot Lulu inquires to the only director that's managed to snag an interview with Walker if he's still gorgeous (A: yes, in a tall, skinny, bit of receding hairline, wildly creative, intellectual mien way. Plus he's sober now for decades. The guy laughs a lot for a supposed morbidly reclusive type, too.) Many depicted fans of old don't ""get"" his newest work, voicing Luddite disdain for something so far ahead of what's going on now (whenever ""now"" is: that's the beauty of the avant garde) that they fail to embrace pure innovation for its own sake.

You'll see recent footage of him orchestrating in the studio (replete with a percussionist pounding a huge side of pork, or recording sounds under a wooden box,) and explaining his difficult themes with assured ease and aplomb. Thank God Scott Walker is still around, for this is one former pop star turned composer who is actually working at the peak of creative powers right here, right now, a massive acheivement for anyone, but especially former popstars. Trent Reznor should be so lucky when he's Walker's age. Check out ""30 Century Man"" now on dvd to watch a fascinating musical journey.",1247356800,21,3733,5.175496688741722
4080221,4,B00373VA2Y,"I use to play the Walker Brothers ""The Sun Ain't Gonnna Shine Anymore""
on 45 in my room as a 12 year old kid. It was then that I realized that
Scott Walker has one of the strongest voices EVER. He left the group at
their peak, to pursue a solo career. He has put out several solo projects
where he interupts other peoples songs with dark passion, but strong
communication skills (sounds like a Vampire ?) anyway he has been compared
to Jazz Greats; Johnny Hartman and Billy Eckstine, which is great, but he is much more of a experiementalist. I have to admit I enjoy his earlier
works more than his most recent efforts, but I would drive from Miami to NYC just to hear him live. This Video captures his story, life, music etc
if you watch it, and go hmmmmmm, becareful, like the Vampire, once you invite him in, you'll never be able to get him out of your head.",1246406400,14,861,4.2560975609756095

8390259,5,B00373VA2Y,"The timing of my seeing this documentary about Scott Walker couldn't have been better. Hes really the only artist who began doing haunting yet predictable songs such as The sun aint gonna shine anymore, which I hadnt heard in a long time, then over forty years progressed to create some of the most experimental music ever created. Recently Sun aint gonna shine was used for the trailer of AMCs Walking Dead series, and I downloaded the song and listened to it over and over again just two weeks ago. Then I find this film about Walker. For me, discovering Walkers musical genious was imperative for my own musical journey, because for some time now I have my self been a solo artist who has created some pretty dark experimental material. Always feeling like I couldn't find a way to create my genuine masterpiece. Walkers music has given me that inspiration and I am excited to see what I can create having experieced Walkers musical genious. Some of my work sounds lossely similar in theme and idea to Walkers more recent works, however nowhere near as electric and beautiful. My earlier inspirations came from artists such as Death In June, Diamanda Galas, Leonard Coen and Rozz Williams spoken word recordings. Walkers inspiration has added the missing piece to the puzzle I had been dreaming of. Now the boundries seem limitless. Walker is truly one of the most gifted and creative musical artists I have ever heard. I am really sitting here with Jaw dropped and astonished at this man and his creative talent.",1367625600,3,1516,4.790076335877862

8390261,3,B00373VA2Y,"Film director Stephen Kijak's film is to be commended for never descending into minutia on Engel's life. In fact, virtually nothing, after the initial information on Engle's youth, is mentioned of his private life. This is refreshing, for it lifts the film well above any claims of being a vanity documentary. The negative is that Engel's `art' is simply not good. Yes, he had a deep, powerful bass voice, and it was put to great effect in the early recordings. But, listening to his latest efforts, not only are his lyrics bad (Jim Morrison, Walker is not, even as some talking heads bizarrely link him to T.S. Eliot, Samuel Beckett, and James Joyce)- in a jumbled sense, but they border on PC and the `music,' such as it is, is random and found noise, not harmonies and melodies. To top it off, Engel's voice is a dim echo of its former glory, often descending into what seems like a parody of some local 1960s television station's late night horror film show host's attempt at singing to a bad B film.

  Initially, the film plays out like a mockumentary, but the infusion of vintage television clips dashes that surmise. What is not dashed is the reality of how limited the `art' of Engel's music. Great art does art well. Visionary art pushes boundaries, as well. But, to push the boundaries back, the artist has to stay anchored to the extremes, at least of the art form. In the case of music, this means non-banal lyrics, damning predictable percussion, varying melodies and other such extensions. Simply going off into a corner and wailing, or grunting, is not an extension of music nor singing, as arts. Of course, that is hyperbole, but Walker's latest efforts smack of a phenomenon known in the arts- that of the spent artist realizing he'll never duplicate his earlier successes, so he just preens and deranges, then hides behind the veneer of his earlier success, as a `genius,' or the like (and it's no shock to know Engel worships the Beatniks). Engel simply never expands the boundaries of music- pop nor otherwise, even as talking heads damn many of the progressive rock acts of the 1970s that went far beyond Walker's experimentalism: Yes, King Crimson, and others.

  Scott Walker: 30 Century Man (the title taken from an Engel song) is a well wrought and exquisitely structured film on an ultimately interesting subject, but that subject is not Engel nor music nor art, but the peregrinations of the spent artist in search of that golden nipple needed to nurse him into senescence's uneasy drool. Now, if only director Kijack can find an artist and subject worthy of his talents, the film will be a landmark in the genre.",1359676800,7,2641,4.742919389978214
8390262,5,B00373VA2Y,"There is a wonderful and very poignant moment in this doco when Ute Lemper has revealed to her the orchestration layered over her vocal performance in a track written for her by Scott Walker. She had rather dismissedly been discussing with her interviewer that she found Walker difficult to work with, and to fathom because he insisted that she scream her vocal when she wanted more nuance. Then the interviewer plays the track for her, which obviously she had avoided listening to in the intervening years. She is absolutely flawed by the beauty in the orchestration. She sits there speechless and on the verge of tears.

 It is a wonderful moment worthy of a Werner Herzog documentary, because he too knows the power of letting the image speak for itself.

This is a remarkable movie. Walker is a really humble, fascinating and intelligent subject. His art gets the sophisticated treatment it deserves, we'll apart from Jarvis Cocker, who is a bit of a tosser really.",1355875200,,969,4.86060606060606
