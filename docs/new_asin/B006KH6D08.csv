8500155,4,B006KH6D08,"This is a really optimistic documentary about all the wonderful EV options available to Californians in 2012 or ""real soon now"". If you weren't pumped up before seeing this, you certainly will be by the end! Lots of good interviews with various EV people and producers. That portion is well done.
From the perspective of 2017 this is pretty much an artifact of history. Most of the promised vehicles never appeared (""Tango"") or were slipped into the video despite being <35mph ""neighborhood"" cars (""Wheego""). The highly optimistic prognostications of EV adoption are now seen to be 10-20 years too optimistic. But this is all interesting historically and fun to watch.
The only downer is the extremely silly scenes which use a student talking to her dad to frame the individual interview segments. These scenes are so amateurish that you're embarrassed for the actors.",1494288000,,868,5.076923076923077

Before the film begins there is an introduction about Electric Vehicles (EV's) by the producer, for Nemours Marketing, which tells why they produced the film and about the research and interviews they did. The main movie itself is about a college girl named Julie Smith that decides to do a research paper on electric cars. Then it cuts to interviews, with industry people, advocates, as well as people familiar and unfamiliar with electric cars, along with clips from news reels. They try to show every Electric Vehicle available at the time from mass production cars, down to cars limited to 25 miles an hour and city driving, from three wheeled vehicles to a 18 wheeler semitruck. The story cuts back to her from time to time.

It deals with cost of use for over 10 years, insurance. Other issues such as gas to electric car conversions are also discussed. The history of Electric cars is also told. The story the 1990's leasing and destroying of cars, and how that lead to groups like 'Plug in America' is also mentioned. It looks at the U.S.A.'s  oil dependents on foreign countries, and how electric vehicles can be fueled by solar panels, and the cost of installing them, allowing the price of electrical power to be lowered even farther. It showcases a comparison between the parts needed to run a gas powered car, and that of an the electric car. It also details such things as coal powered electrical plants with vehicle that can be 90% clean with that pollution, as compared to the 17% efficiency that gas powered cars can get and the greater pollution they make. Features such as regenerative breaking for EV's is also explained. Accidents in gasoline powered transporting are then compared to energy that is gained from plugging into the wall, and the safety disconnects that batteries have. Battery recycling, and reusage as energy storage is also discussed. Charging from household 110V, and away from home chargers, along with free charging offered by businesses for using their other services is another point they try to share. Unlike many green documentaries, they don't talk much about green house gasses or global warming as seen in other places, they simply call gasoline emissions, pollution that can cause health problems in people and to make them sick, in such places like Los Angles.

The girl after finishing her report eventually gets her father to go and look into buying an electric car. Although the movie features mostly battery electric cars, from the USA, other countries, Hybrid, and gas powered generator cars are also briefly mentioned.

The extra features are;
* Alexandra Paul talks about her Electric Cars, 5 minute 50 second interview, the viewer only gets to read the question and afterward listen to her reply.

* ""Back to the Future"", a interview with Howard Dunholder. Nearly 16 minutes long. He tells how in 1920 he got to ride electric vehicles. Then the history of the The 1990's EV1 and how it never went through the standard safety tests that were required for the cars to be sold, so they were only leased. His decision to buy a Tesla Roadster, and what he thinks the future will be for EV's.

* Discussion with the makers of this film. Nearly 14 minutes long. The Host/Producer, and Co-producer talk about the inspiration of the movie, the cars that were available at the time, and that gas cars were bragging about having 32 and 33 miles per gallon efficiency. How they were impressed by different features of EV's. They then thank the crew and their investors for making the film possible. The end has a parody of Back to the Future movie with the Co-producer dressed up as Doc Brown.

In the end it is a pretty good documentary, and instead of gas type references in official car window stickers, with things such as 'eGallon', and 'MPGe'. I think they should use the phrase mentioned on this DVD, and use the term S-miles (smiles).",1372377600,2,3915,4.78962962962963
