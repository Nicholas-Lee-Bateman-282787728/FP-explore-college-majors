4505682,5,B004Z6N6XS,This product is great for someone recovering from total knee replacement. It really helps with flexibility of knees and legs. Its also good for people without knee problems to open up flexibility in the legs and hips.,1363651200,11,217,4.891891891891892
4505683,4,B004Z6N6XS,I am 37 and have level 4 arthritis in my left knee and torn cartilage in my right.  This video I found to be extremely helpful and I loved that it had different levels depending on your age and abilities.,1360281600,11,204,4.1
4505684,2,B004Z6N6XS,"Jill Miller is a Yoga Instructor so a lot of the exercises are very Yoga oriented and non-conventional.  While it is fun watching her do the moves, there are so many of them and so much information that it will be extremely hard to follow as an exercise as a routine.  It also seemed to me that she is making a lot of this stuff up so I am not sure how much science there is behind them as opposed to more standard knee exercises practiced by physical therapists and thought by hospitals, universities, etc.  I found the DVD called ""Strong Knees"" by Chantal Donnelly much more helpful for my knee exercises.  If you purchase this DVD, to perform the routines, you will need Yoga Balls, Yoga Bricks, and a net two hold two Yoga Balls together.",1349308800,11,742,4.394160583941606
4505685,5,B004Z6N6XS,I have patellofemoral syndrome (runner's knee).  Most workout DVDs I don't like because there is too much I can't do.  These exercises were really good and seem to get most of the muscles that effect the knee.  I can really feel the muscles working without hurting my knee.  There are three levels which is really helpful.  I would definitely recommend this.,1342828800,14,358,4.80327868852459
4505686,2,B004Z6N6XS,"I have the typical middle-aged ""bad knee."" An old high school injury and years of just living have taken their toll. I expected that this video would provide exercise routines for knee rehabilitation. Well, it does -- sort of. Lots of great anatomical information, a demonstration of how to do some movements to strengthen leg muscles, but no actual ""now let's do it"" section complete with the instructor keeping count of repetitions, etc.

Bottom line: I would not recommend this if you want to do daily exercises for your knees.",1334880000,54,530,4.888888888888889
4505687,5,B004Z6N6XS,"First of all, you will want to purchase a pair of yoga therapy balls with tote (I couldn't find them on Amazon but you can buy them on the company's website-you'll get the info you need from the flyers inside the package).  It would be nice if they were offered as a kit along with the DVD but they are not, so get over it because you will need them to use the DVD.  The balls come in a mesh bag that you use to keep the balls together for some of the moves and for other moves you take the balls out of the bag to use individually.  If you don't like handling your balls that much then buy two sets and keep one pair in the bag.  Now be warned, these balls are soft and squishy and obviously treated with a canine attracting pheromone.  As soon as I removed mine from the box, my dogs were all over me.  They had only one thing on their minds-""Fetch"".  It definately added an extra level of difficulty to the exercises trying to keep my dogs from taking off with my balls between moves.

But all joking aside, I hurt my back in 1996 which led to an altered gait (I fall a lot and use a cane at times) but I still kept exercising as best I could.  Flash forward 15 years, and that altered gait has put so much stress on my knees that the pain became unbearable.  My doctor tried physical therapy, cortisone shots into both knees and prescription anti inflammatory drugs but the problem continued to worsen and I feared that I would soon be unable to walk.  Faced with going back to using my wheelchair, I knew that I had to do something, anything to fix my knees.

The first time I used the Kneehab DVD I was surprised how difficult some of the exercises were.  With limited mobility, I found it very difficult to do some of the basic exercises, especially the ones where I had to hold my self up on my elbow and roll around on the therapy balls.  I wish Ms. Miller would have demonstrated variations on the exercises for the disabled.  But, I persevered and improvised by simply using my hands to rub the balls on the targeted muscles.  Afterwards, I was amazed at the results!  I was able to walk up and down the stairs with significantly less pain AFTER ONLY ONE SESSION!!!!!  And that was only using the ""Prehab Kneehab"" section.  I can only imagine what the results will be with regular use and after I've tackled all 4 sections (they include stretching and strengthing exercises). I hope to soon be able to do all the exercises as demonstrated without modification.

If you suffer from knee pain or stiffness, then you owe it to yourself to try the Kneehab program.  What do you have to lose except your pain?  And besides, it doesn't have any known side effects unlike the drugs most of us take for our knee pain.",1334448000,60,2720,4.292156862745098
4505688,5,B004Z6N6XS,"I really liked the DVD, I've had problems in my knee since I was 15 and the exercises the DVD offers have helped me a lot with the pain I have in my knee, I feel like I will never have to worry about my knee again!!! ^^",1330300800,3,219,3.5833333333333335
4505689,3,B004Z6N6XS,This program requires the use of small yoga balls that do not come with the DVD nor can I find them on amazon.  Misleading!  Too bad since the exercises seem ok.,1328572800,11,161,4.161290322580645
4505690,5,B004Z6N6XS,"I have had 2 ACL reconstructions- one in EACH leg and after working with this video I can finally make it down a flight of stairs without pain, there is less cracking and crepitus in my knees, and my hips and lower back pain have also diminished by 50%!!!!
I had to be extremely patient and diligent though and work and master each stage of the progression- First Pre-hab, then Knee-hab 1 &  Knee-Hab 2, and finally I can do Knee- How!
It is anatomically informative and so beneficial for all levels of fitness. I can say that because I am a yoga instructor, massage therapist and an anatomy teacher!  However, I believe I am most qualified to recommend this video because I WAS a knee pain sufferer too.
I can safely say that this video has been invaluable in my knee re-hab and re-education but it has also made me feel that my knees are now in better shape than they were PRE-Surgery! Hmmmm, perhaps all that mis-alignment was why they got so injured in the first place!. Now, I know at first  most knees should walk and not run to get this video, but after you put in some well-knee-ded time with this video, you may be finally able to RUN and get your friend's knees a copy too!",1320105600,82,1183,4.343891402714932
4505691,5,B004Z6N6XS,"I have many of Jill Millers' DVD's, all of which have been extremely beneficial. That saud, this is my favorite one thus far. It is clear, unique, and gives great results. I am a Yoga Therapist/Bodworker and have used a lot of these techniques with my clients who suffer from Knee pain who now have found great relief.",1319846400,31,318,4.5

4505694,5,B004Z6N6XS,I love this video. It offers a lot of good rehabilitative knee exercises which are meant too strengthen your knees. The tape is good especially if you are recovering from a knee injury as the exercises are not too strenuous but do aid in safely strengthening the knee.

4505699,5,B004Z6N6XS,This DVD is great! Within one week I could see a big improvement. I didn't want to wait for the yoga therapy balls to come in so I got tennis balls and put them in a tube sock. That worked just fine. This is a must have for knee and hip pain. The DVD is in sections so you can do part of it or all of it.,1424390400,3,304,3.485294117647059

I wasted an absurd amount of time and money going to PT, but it never helped.  I got such quick and amazing results using this video - it is like myofascial massage you do for yourself.  Both  my knee and my problem hip feel better than ever as a result of using the techniques I learned on this video.  Excellent instruction.  I have been very pleased with all of her videos, but this one was a game changer.  Thank you, Jill!",1387929600,12,547,4.10377358490566
4505708,5,B004Z6N6XS,"Studio setting.
No music.
No yoga,... really.
But energy, focus and well-spoken cues.

There can't be a safer knee rehab video out there. There are 4 'workouts' from very easy in a chair (where I'll be starting) to full-on 'this is for athletes' super challenging. She does move quickly through the instruction, but demos well, too. I'm pretty picky when it comes to safety and instruction and this makes the cut into my collection; I'll keep the remote/pause button handy.  I need to strengthen my knees (old athletic injury/strain) to get to the next step in my yoga practice and will be picking up this DVD. I can only do about 10 min of targeted knee stuff in the morning alongside my normal workout, and this will work great. I am super excited to have found it.",1381276800,12,767,4.591240875912408
4505709,4,B004Z6N6XS,"At first I was quite pissed off that the trainer makes you order balls from her company website. It felt rather manipulative, first buy the DVD, when it arrives realize you can't do the pre-hab part cuz you don't have the balls. Why don't they sell the DVD and balls as a package???  (I used my hands instead to deep massage the parts she was targeting with the balls.)

But then when I moved to Knee-rehab1, I liked the exercises. I feel they've already made my muscles stronger thus my knee feels more stable (a problem after my 2nd semi-injury). Some of her knee-rehab2 exercises I can't do yet, but I know there is wisdom in others. Like the hip rotations are good since from a Yoga for Knees book I was reading, hip joint inflexibility puts torque on knees and causes problems.

So I guess this DVD can be useful, and I already see good effects although it's less than a week that I've started using it.
(Still hadn't got over the balls issue though!)",1380412800,2,956,4.420454545454546
4505710,5,B004Z6N6XS,Really helpful. I have chondromalycia and the moves in this dvd seem to help. I need to do it more often though ;),1379289600,2,114,4.0
4505711,4,B004Z6N6XS,"I bought this on Amazon and forgot about it until a recent knee surgery. I played the video to see if I could do anything post-op. All the other reviews say you need to buy the Yoga Therapy balls which you can only get through her Yoga Tune Up website. You can improvise and save $. I got a $2 can of tennis balls and an old sock for the ""PreHab"" portion of the video. I was too weak to do them as easily as the instructor but I took her advice and just laid on the balls. In fact, I paused the DVD and moved the balls to many of the butt, hip, and thigh areas and just let gravity and weight give me a like-trigger point massage. Great! Ouch, but worth it. This seemed to have awakened tendons and muscle that get little attention but are stressed out from compensating for bad gait. For this, the DVD pays for itself. Recommend once a day, every day. You can even do them on your bed.

I next observed level 1 which is all sitting on a chair. Easy, but intense, spot-on help. There's the rocking your feet toe to heel, rocking your feet side to side. These activate the ankles and calves. I also like the one that looks like you're doing a sitting down version of the Charleston.  One of the most helpful, and I do as best I can post-op, is crossing and un-crossing the legs. Activates the hips. There are many more exercises done in the chair that she gives good reasons for doing them and urges you to do them to the best of your ability.

I have observed the next 2 levels and, post-op, I'm not ready for these as they have to be done standing up or bending the knees. I know I will get there but not today as I write this review.

I'm writing this review because I want to tell you this is a pretty darn good video SPECIFIC to knee problems. She does a good job of giving you information, modifying the exercises and increasing the intensity. The video is listed on Amazon in a couple of different areas and price points. Look for the that will save you some money.

And pick up a can of tennis balls the next time you go to the big bis store.",1371081600,30,2049,4.1125
