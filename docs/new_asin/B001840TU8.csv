As Sophie, she is a woman motivated by her strong love for her husband.  Andrew, played by the handsome Korean/American actor David McInnis, feels tremendous guilt over not being able to produce a child.  To keep him from successfully committing suicide, Sophie goes to a fertility clinic.  She sees a Korean man Jihah played by Ha Jung-Woo who is an illegal alien.  Since he cannot earn extra money as a donor at the clinic as an illegal, Sophie follows him & makes her business proposal that he should help her become pregnant.  The plot grows complex as the repeated attempts at insemination create a bond between Sophie and Jihah.  The love triangle comes to a climax as Andrew discovers the tryst.  Farmiga does an excellent job in the leading role.  We can see numerous concerns bounce in front of her eyes.  I also appreciated the spiritual struggle as she attends religious services to please her in-laws without belief.  This changes at the final conflict on the stairwell as she yells out for God's help.  This is a DVD well worth an evening's viewing.  Enjoy!",1225324800,3,1994,6.5534351145038165
3411453,5,B001840TU8,"Even better than I anticipated !

The story is intensly human and touching.

Vera Farmiga is for one, a unqiue and true actress. Rarely do I see a performance as hers.. I felt Ms. Farmiga's character; Sophie Lee was true and real.

Kudos to the whole cast, and Gina Kim whom we hopefully see more of.

But the end is tricky.. I mean it's fairly (I think) easy to assume that Sophie and Ji Hah are together in the end. But you could also think (maybe) that Sophie finally found something in her life (assuming Ji Haha was sent back to Korea, and that was it) carrying a baby with Andrew besides caring for her and Ji Hah's..

What DO YOU THINK? How did it end, really?",1222387200,4,667,4.2204724409448815
3411454,4,B001840TU8,"NEVER FOREVER is a well-developed, well-written and well-directed film by Gina Kim, and with an actress with the stature of Vera Farmiga in the difficult lead role, it is frustrating to see that this fine film didn't last on theater screens.  But as with many of the other treasurable small independent films, this one feels even better in the privacy of the home - the small screen somehow allows the powerful emotions of the story to be more focused.

Sophie (Vera Farmiga) is the beautiful Caucasian wife of wealthy and respected Korean Andrew (David Lee McInnis) and the couple seem to have it all - looks, a close-knit family, beautiful home, etc. - but there is an underlying tension: Sophie and Andrew have been unable to conceive and bear a child, a fact that troubles Andrew's very orthodox Christian family and profoundly affects Andrew's sense of worth.  Though the couple has sought professional assistance, their marriage remains barren. Andrew's fragile stance results in a suicide attempt and in trying to correct the cause of this tragedy, Sophie decides she will attempt to conceive from a donor. Because both members of a couple must consent to artificial insemination, Sophie's plan is thwarted except for one aspect: visiting the clinic she has selected is a young Korean man named Jihah (Jung-woo Ha) who is attempting to be a sperm donor but is rejected because he is an illegal immigrant.  Overhearing this exchange, Sophie follows Jihah and finally discovers where he lives.  She approaches him with a business deal - she will pay him $300. for each session and when she becomes pregnant she will pay him $30,000.  Jihah is shy at first, but he is working in a meat packing plant and dry cleaners trying to save enough money to bring his girlfriend from Korea to the USA.  Desperate for money  Jihah consents and Sophie begins her visits to him when her cycle is conducive to conception.  The relationship is one of quick polite encounters, careful to avoid interpersonal factors that might make either partner uncomfortable.  But a sense of interdependence evolves, and when Sophie achieves pregnancy, the couple decides to part ways.

Sophie's pregnancy at first overjoys Andrew and his family and the couple's future looks bright.  But both Sophie and Jihah are unable to dismiss the intimacy of the relationship they have developed, Andrew discovers Sophie's adventure, and the marriage falls apart while Jihah informs his girlfriend in Korea that he will never be able to bring her to America.  At this vulnerable point the film simply ends - some years later Sophie is at the beach with her son and is again very pregnant and the viewer is left to decide the resolution.

Vera Farmiga is even more beautiful in this role than her many other roles and never for a moment loses our empathy and understanding of the decisions she makes.  Both of the men are strong as are the various actors who flesh out the film.  This is a tough topic to relate, but writer/director Gina Kim allows the acts of love to be the memorable echo the film leaves behind.  Grady Harp, August 08",1217548800,17,3100,4.840909090909091
3411455,3,B001840TU8,"Gina Kim's first attempt at a big film with known actors was a courageous project with a harsh subject matter. She decided to write and direct a film that captures the personal transformation of an emotionally stunted woman, who in short order, sacrifices herself for the sake of her husband's happiness but ends up finding love, passion and inner peace through motherhood.

Vera Farmiga plays the lead role, showcasing her inter-racial Korean marriage to a wealthy New York lawyer. Their inability to have a child has driven a wedge between them that appears to be destroying their partnership. Through a variety of scenes and events, she decides to pay for the ""donations"" of another Korean man to help anonymously become pregnant and save her marriage. The remainder of the film shows the inevitable destruction of her relationship and the consequences of creating such a pact. Several other small plot lines play out to show the culture she lives in, including an overbearing mother-in-law and Korean pastor who both impose their faith-laden ways in trying to make her become pregnant.

The film is shot with long scenes of non-dialogue and lengthy views of New York City. The sex scenes are graphic yet passionate, mainly because Vera made all of her intimacy so heartfelt. She is very believable in displaying her transformation, and you realize the film becomes all about her and not the actual relationships. The ending was deliberately vague, but if you look closely at the small details, there are several clues as to what has happened.

The DVD has two small featurettes (3 and 7 minutes) that provide little regarding the film. One is shot in Korean with no English subtitles, the other is more of a blooper and gag reel of the actors during filming with no narration. Only 1/5 of the film is Korean with English subs, the rest is all in English. The film is a definite watch for Vera's fans, as the other two cast mates are awkward unknowns and the camera work of New York is sub-standard, but tolerable.",1215993600,9,2017,4.840579710144928

3411462,4,B001840TU8,"I am sure that the end of this film is telling us that Sophie left her husband (who was a bit hung up on his mamma, self absorbed, and cruel) to move to Korea with her lover. The clues are all there. The lover (whose name escapes me) asks the jailer if he may make a call at the time of day when Sophie would be at his apartment - he has left his cell phone behind. The phone rings in the apartment - Sophie answers, and the next shot is of Sophie on a beach like the one depicted in the poster hanging on the apartment wall. Sophie is with her now four or five year old child, and pregnant. She seems very happy. The film explores the idea of what makes us happy. Sophie thought she wanted a child for her husband - she did not - she wanted it for herself. The husband had everything, money, prestige, and a beautiful life, but he was not happy. Sophie's lover thought living in America would make him happy, but he would have been happy anywhere with Sophie, and their child.

Even in films with major themes about immigration and cultural diversity, there is always the trophy white woman. Yes, she's doing it to save her husband, so noble.

3411488,5,B001840TU8,"Loved the movie. Loved the story. Loved the ending. The ending isn't at all ambiguous because there are a number of conversations in the movie that allude to it and eliminate any ambiguity.
The three main characters all felt like they were in a desperate situation but in the end it all came down to how each character responded to that situation - who they were or became in the face of that desperation. Vera Farmiga does an amazing job nuancing her character's growth throughout this movie What a wonderfully character driven film. I've watched it three times and am amazed at subtleties that I didn't recognize in my previous viewings.

<<<ENDING SPOILER>>>

In the end she chose Jiha. If you notice - and you must look carefully - she is wearing a blue sapphire ring on her left ring finger. If you can recall, when Jiha went to the jeweler to buy a ring for the woman he loves the jeweler recommended he buy either a diamond or sapphire ring depending on who the woman was and what the she represented for him. The description of the women mirrored the two women in his life at that time. Up until that point we knew that he was waiting to make enough money to send for his fiancee back home in Korea but we also knew that he was falling in love with Sophie. So while engaged in conversation with the jeweler he made a choice - which wasn't heard or seen by the audience. So in the end he chose Sophie. Also, earlier in the film Sophie asked Jiha if the picture on the wall was a picture of the place where he grew up and he responded that it wasn't but it's the kind of place that he hoped to live. The beach scene in the end looked like the picture on the wall. So they chose each other.",1482883200,19,1695,4.277258566978193

3411496,5,B001840TU8,"I am not Korean and I'm no expert on Korean culture or film.  If you think my analysis is incorrect leave a comment.

Spoiler Alerts!

This is basically a Korean dramatic film set in the US with a white American female lead.  Many people have found it unrealistic that Sophie doesn't work even though she has no kids and they have a housemaid.  In Korean films the wives of high earning men like Andrew never work outside the home and or do their own housework even if they don't have children.  Some people find it overly wrought that Andrew attempts suicide when faced with infertility rather than looking into adoption.  Family bloodlines, especially from father to son, are very important in Korean culture and although things are starting to change adoption is rarely well thought of.  The movie begins with the funeral of Andrew's father; in traditional Korean customs it is devastating for a man to be unable to give his father a grandson before his father dies.  These stresses make it more reasonable for Sophie to go to desperate and bizarre lengths to give her husband and in-laws the baby they long for and more reasonable for her to try and keep it secret.

  Some people have found the end, when Andrew attacks Sophie after learning of her infidelity, demonizes him and makes it all-to-convenient for Sophie to leave her marriage without guilt.  I think that Andrew's violence is realistic and believable.  We've all seen murder-suicides on the news where a man murders his wife and children before killing himself.  A person like Andrew, who values his own life so little that he tries to kill himself, is unlikely to care much about the safety and well-being of his wife and her unborn baby, especially when she tries to leave him.  Andrew exhibits self-absorption throughout the film and tells Sophie he loves her because she always puts other people first.  He never asks her if she is happy with everything she does to please his family, such as going to church when she isn't religious.  Jihah is the first character to ask her what she wants for herself.

And this is my interpretation of the ""plot hole"" wherein she offers Jihah money for sex.  If she really wanted to discretely get pregnant without Andrew's knowledge to save the marriage she could have paid Jihah a far lower fee to go to another fertility clinic and pretend to be her husband.  However I think that she unconsciously wanted to get out of her marriage.  She impulsively follows Jihah who, unlike her husband, was healthy, strong and comfortable in his own skin.  At certain points when she looks at him and talks to him, before they ever have sex, you can see her eyes flashing with desire.  This is unconscious to her at first and she offers an absurd amount of money for sex with him to persuade herself that it is a solely business transaction.  Her husband brings a piano into the house without asking Sophie; Jihah asks her what kind of blanket she'd prefer.  In the end  we see that Andrew is a weak man who only cares about his wife when she is totally focused on his desires.  Jihah loves Sophie even when she tells him she doesn't want to be with him.  Many people were unhappy with the ending because it was ambiguous about who Sophie ended up with but I think it showed that in the long run Jihah's love and acceptance of Sophie as a woman who puts herself first liberates her to create a happy life no matter which man she chooses.  Her confident smile which closes the movie shows us that she has found that place inside herself.",1477699200,17,3534,4.608

3411531,4,B001840TU8,"Well, for ME, it's all about Ms. Farmiga.  I've seen many of the films she's been in, and each one is better than the next. Her ability to portray emotion is amazing. Fear? She portrays it, I FEEL it. Love? Vera portrays it, I FEEL it. Disgust, horror, anxiety, excitement...she's just amazing!  I feel she gives such LIFE to her characters, and I'm always entranced and blown away by her performance. I feel she makes every film BETTER.  I was completely and TOTALLY hooked on  ""Bates Motel"".  ""Norma""  hasn't ever made a film appearance that I'M aware of, anyway. Ms. Farmiga NAILED it. (oh, and Freddy was terrific,too!) But that's just the cherry on top!
This film is a good film, stirring and raw. A situation that could very easily come about...sad and compelling.  I felt deeply for the characters in this movie. If you want cheering up, you might look ELSEWHERE, as this film tackles some  very troubling and emotional conflict.  (and I, personally, ROCK at all of THAT sad, troubling stuff.)  While this film looks DEEPLY into the many  frailties and foibles of human character, there is also love and tenderness peeking through.

I was cringing at how bad the actor who plays her husband was. It does have an interesting premise and tells an unconventional love story, but there is something fundamentally missing in the movie and thus failed to connect with me as a viewer.

3411666,4,B001840TU8,"I love Vera Farmiga.
I also love her little sister, Taissa Farmiga, who looks so much like her and is also a really good actress.

This movie was unique.
It started off interesting and slowly became suspenseful until I couldn't wait to see what would happen next and how it would end.

S P O I L E R S ..

I would have liked some backstory, such as how Sophie ended up with a Korean man and why, especially when he is so religious and she is not.  What kind of work did Andrew do?  He obviously worked long hours and made amazing money (because Sophie did not work and always expected Andrew home late, plus they had a nice house (out of Manhattan) and a maid).

Why was Andrew suicidal - - was it just that the death of his father was too much?  Or that he couldn't have a child with his wife?  I don't think that is enough for a man who has everything to want to die, so I would have liked more explanation.  I saw from the beginning that Andrew had emotional problems, by the way that he practically raped Sophie right after the funeral, with broken glass all over the floor.

What did Sophie do all day?  She didn't work, didn't ""volunteer"" as the maid called it, didn't clean the house (the maid did all the work), didn't cook (the mother-in-law was a better cook). She obviously did a lot of shopping because she had designer clothes and shoes and lingerie. So, she had plenty of free time to find some trouble to get into.  I thought that it was funny the way that Sophie neatly folded her clothes and put them into plastic ziplock bags.

The movie really surprised me, especially the ending.
I kept guessing what would happen next, and I was wrong each time.

I expected a twist, but what I expected did not happen.  I thought that Jin would blackmail Sophie (by threatening to tell Andrew everything unless she kept giving him more and more money).  I thought that Jin would demand to see his baby.  I thought that Sophie would keep paying Jin blackmail money until she would eventually have to confess everything to Andrew.  But, none of that happened.  I liked the movie's twist better than what I thought would happen.  I did not expect Jin and Sophie to fall in love.  I thought that Jin was just after the money, and I thought that Sophie loved her husband so much that she wouldn't be able to fall for Jin, which is how it all started out but not how it ended.

Jin really lucked out in this movie (except for being sent back to Korea).  This man has an attractive woman approach him, out of nowhere, and ask him to have sex with her.  She offers to pay him - - most men would do it for free.  So, he gets to have sex (without a condom), several times, and she comes to his apartment (he doesn't even have to do any traveling) and he gets paid well, and there are no strings (he doesn't even have to make conversation) - - she even bought him an expensive dinner.  Then, he gets $30,000 (tax-free)  for getting her pregnant, and he never has to see her again or pay child support.  His money problems are over.  How many men would think this was a lucky deal?

I wondered how Sophie came up with the dollar amounts of $300 and $30,000 - especially considering that she doesn't work, meaning that Andrew really paid for everything.... $50 each time would have been enough and the $30,000 was completely unnecessary and way too much for a quick and easy and pleasurable job.  How would Sophie have explained it when Andrew eventually noticed that all of this money was gone from their bank account?

Andrew found his wife cheating and immediately realized that the baby was not his.  I expected him to wait outside of the apartment for her to come out and then confront her, or pound on the door to confront both of them, which did not happen.  I expected a fight scene between the two men, which never happened.

Andrew knew that Sophie cheated and he knew that the baby was not his, but he didn't let Sophie know that he found out.
Instead, he got the ultimate revenge.  He called the police and had Jin sent back to Korea (so that the affair would have to permanently end) and then he demanded that Sophie abort the baby.  But, in another twist, Andrew lost everything -- his wife and baby -- (but Andrew isn't suicidal anymore?).

I was surprised when Andrew said that he would forgive and forget the affair.  I didn't expect him to still want to be with her.  I didn't expect him to try to kill the baby.  Pushing Sophie down a flight of stairs can cause horrible injuries, such as being paralyzed or even death, or minor injuries with the baby still surviving anyway, and Andrew could have gone to jail for that.

I was again surprised when Sophie obviously left Andrew.  She obviously fell out of love for him when he became violent with her and demanded that she abort the baby, and that he was so cruel as to get Jin sent to Korea.  She could not have loved Andrew so much if she kept cheating on him even after she became pregnant.  She fell in love with Jin, even if she couldn't realize it until after Andrew turned on her. She must have realized that the only good thing about Andrew was that he was a good provider.

I wondered if Jin ran into his old girlfriend once he was back in Korea, and what she would think about Jin being with a white woman.

The end was a little confusing, but there are only two possibilities :

(1) Sophie left Andrew.  She followed Jin to Korea.  Jin had a poster on his apartment wall of a beach that reminded him of his home in Korea.  So, when Sophie was on the beach at the end, we can assume that she is on that beach in Korea.  The little boy is obviously their son and about four years have passed.  Sophie is pregnant again.  So, we can assume that Sophie has been living in Korea with Jin, possibly now married to him, and they are raising their son and are expecting another baby.  Sophie is knitting, and we can see that she is wearing the sapphire ring that Jin bought for her, instead of her wedding ring from Andrew.

(2) Sophie left Andrew.  She has been raising her son alone in New York.  She has been visiting Jin in Korea (at least one time, obviously, to become pregnant with a second baby).  Sophie raises her son alone, visits Jin in Korea from time to time, and is having their second child.  This would explain why Jin was not in the last scene (because he is living in Korea and Sophie and their son have remained in New York).  We see that Sophie is wearing the sapphire ring that Jin bought for her, instead of her wedding ring from Andrew.

I think that my first possibility is correct.
If anyone can think of a different explanation of the ending, I would really like to hear it.
Anyway, it is obvious that Sophie and Jin are together and happy.
I wondered what happened to Andrew at the end.",1452038400,17,6778,4.309881422924901

3411668,3,B001840TU8,"The movie started off slow for about 15-20 minutes but the movie was good. The only reason I will not say great is because I felt it left too many moral questions in the movie unanswered. The majority vid is not about sex it is deeper than that. There are some sex scenes but the producer makes the movie so captivating that the focus is on internal questions of morals that are in conflict with right and wrong which affect happiness. The producer of the movie has a gift for film. This movie is captivating and so unique. It is not an overdone cliche of a couples quest to have a child. In a way the producer allows the audience to relate to the woman rather you are man or woman. But the ending is unclear and it doesn't leave the audience with a moral or a lesson. But if I were rating it solely and only on entertainment I would give it a 4 1/2 stars. Overall the movie is good but if you are religious and believe strongly in your faith it might leave you questioning the movie as to why it, is based on religion but neither person in the relationship believed. That is not to say that they could not make mistakes but  the fact that they both were just going through the motions didn't make the movie a 5 star for me.",1451779200,8,1224,4.1645569620253164

3411685,2,B001840TU8,"I first became a Vera Farmiga fan after seeing her as Norma Bates in ""Bates' Motel"", the current TV version of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".  Since then, I've grown to appreciate her acting skills in several movies, the most recent seen of which is ""Never Forever"".  While still loving the acting (as well as her body, which is almost totally on display here) of America's favorite MILF, I think she would have done herself better to avoid having taken part in this great disappointment of a film.

It's not that the acting is so bad - except for David Lee McInnis as Andrew Lee, Sophie's (Farmiga's) husband - nor the direction.  The script, on the other hand, leaves too much to be desired. It's all about sex, sex, sex.  Never once do we see Sophie and Andrew actually communicating regarding Andrew's infertility, never once do we see Sophie and Andrew discussing artificial insemination or adoption as alternatives, never once do we really see much of Sophie's interaction with her perpetually glaring in-laws, nor her relationship with her mother-in-law (MIL to we K-drama fans), who is something of a non-entity.  Yet, these are the things which most viewers would be especially curious about, things which should have formed the foundation of everything else that happens subsequently.  In short, there is far too much sex (yes, even to include Farmiga's very fine body) and not enough substance.

Perhaps the brightest thing in this movie is ""Jung Woo Ha"" (really, Ha Jung U) as Sophie's stud, and later True Love, Jihah, an illegal immigrant from South Korea.  Ha's acting is first rate, and he is remarkably able to competently deliver the few English sentences and expressions he's required to speak, without having much of an obvious command of the language. He is also very effective playing off Farmiga in the (other than sex) scenes they share.  But then again, he has the best written part in the film.  Still, we wish we had more background on the character of Jihah, other than where he's from, what jobs he holds down, and that he has a girlfriend (whom he ultimately dumps for Sophie's obvious charms).

The ending of ""Never Forever"" is really the worst part of this rather mediocre film.  It's confusing.  It's more than confusing - it's dissatisfying.  Endings should be . . . endings.  They should have some closure, or lead the imagination to something, someplace, else.  I suppose it could be argued that the ending of this movie does just that . . . kind of.  But it's that ""kind of"" that leaves the feeling of confusion - and dissatisfaction.

This is one of those ""it had so much potential"" films that aggravate ordinary viewers to no end.  There are so many things that could have been done better, but haven't been.  Again, the chief fault lies in a script that's overly focused on one aspect - sex - which turns out to be be the wrong aspect.  It should have been more about potentially interesting relationships.",1444953600,4,2937,4.785714285714286
3411686,5,B001840TU8,"This is a beautifully shot and acted film. Gina Kim, the Korean filmmaker, directs it to near perfection with a wonderfully natural result. The music is a unique and flawless fit. Vera Farmiga and Ha Jung-woo are strikingly well cast. The depth and range of each character's individual and combined story are well explored and credible. It's also a very sexy movie and not in a brutish jump-the-bones way. Sex ostensibly for insemination-purposes-only goes awry here, and the story goes far to dispel the notion that that's even possible. The relationship between these 2 strangers , which is at first objective, evolves into a wholly subjective one with exquisitely moving love scenes, often absent in many films , or in the imaginations of many writers and/or directors.  Often in film, this kind of expressive lovemaking is replaced with much hoisting and driving into walls.  The sensitivity and tender sensuality between these two is a bit of fine art and a little reminiscent of the last scene in Stealing Beauty.

Her husband, Andrew, just buried his father and there has always been a wish for a male child to carry on the family lineage. When Andrew finds that he is sterile it drives him to a suicide attempt. All of this devastates Sophie and she is desperate in trying to give him a child although they have tried to conceive before, but to no avail. Sophie then pays for sex to an illegal Korean alien named Jihah to conceive a child for her husband and to save their marriage. She falls in love with Jihah even though she tries not to. The story is compelling in that she has to make a choice between two men that she loves and  the future for her and her child.  This film addresses so many real life issues on love, interracial marriage, suicide, choices on artificial insemination, abortion, spirituality, and immigration, etc. and the difficulty in making right choices. What is a right choice for one may not be right for another. I think the ending is clear. There are hints that Sophie comes to terms that she has to do what is right for her and her son and bring fulfillment to her life. Sometimes one has to start over from nothing as the film indicates.

Vera Farmiga is one of the best actresses of all time. I don't think anyone tops her. She can  be funny, honest, open, emotional, sensual, innocent and passionate, all at once in the characters and roles she chooses, and it seems that all of it comes so natural for her. She is a consummate actress. Vera gives 100% in every performance I have seen.

The film, which is about a woman in a difficult marriage who turns to a sperm donor to become pregnant when her husband's sperm prove not to be viable, is incredibly powerful and moving. It is the story of an unlikely courtship that begins with sex for pregnancy and turns into so much more, just as the woman's marriage is disintegrating. Those who are uncomfortable with sex scenes in films might want to shy away, but I found everything to be incredibly tastefully done, and I love seeing the relationship between the two principal characters grow and change.",1420588800,4,689,4.655737704918033

This is a beautiful drama and Farmiga is absolutely spellbinding. She's a serious and committed actress, I don't think she's ever given a less than performance, she is a true natural. Farmiga plays Sophie Lee, a young wife who's husband has tried to kill himself. She thinks having a baby might help save her husband and their marriage. The problem is the couple are having troubles conceiving and Sophie will do anything she can to get pregnant, even paying another man to make her dreams come true.

But having recently listened to an audio version of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" by D.H. Lawrence, I was struck by the many similarities between the two stories.

Spoilers ahead....

In the most basic of plot summaries: a lovely young woman is married to a rather cold, hard-hearted, and wealthy man who is unable to father a child.  The woman, by coincidence, encounters a man of much lower social standing, with whom she becomes involved sexually.

What begins, in each case, as an almost mechanical, primarily sexual involvement (and in quite humble surroundings), becomes an increasingly sensual, passionate, and emotional relationship.

Eventually, the woman must choose between her wealthy husband, and the other man -- with whom she has fallen in love.

Two similarly satisfying stories....",1302912000,4,902,5.179310344827586
3411726,5,B001840TU8,"I am an avid admirer of Ha Jung Woo. He is such a splendid actor. In this role he plays a difficult character and makes it believable.  Farmiga also is just the actress to play this lead against Ha.  It was quite believeble for me to watch her difficult decision, because in a Korean chaebol family it is absolutely required that the son will have a child and preferably a boy.  It was his inability, and she took her own strength to find a way to satisfy her in-laws.  Despite the awkwardness she was ultimately vulnerable to the emotions that developed between her and the Korean worker who needed money.  Theycould not avoid the passion between them. I was constantly holding my breath to see them go over the edge of the 'business arrangement'.  Ha just became irresistible to her.
.  I have only one slight critical note. I wanted to see Ha Jung Woo with her and his two children in the beach scene at the end.  You just know they are a happy family and she is finally a glowing woman who is satisfied with her life.
I truly loved this film and highly recommend it.
To appreciate the breadth of Ha Jung Woo as a serious actor it is fascinating to watch him in another film ..'The Chaser'.
Very harsh and a very heavy sinister film.",1301961600,19,1236,4.366812227074236

3411729,5,B001840TU8,"There's something about 'Never Forever' that was so intriguing to me- I rented it and watched it 3 times. I later decided I really wanted to own it.

Vera Farmiga plays Sophie Lee, an upper class woman married to a successful Korean businessman who is troubled and depressed.  The couple desperately want children but the husband is unable to make Sophie conceive. After his suicide attempt, Sophie steps well out of her comfortable world and in desperation secretly propositions a poor illegal Korean alien to get her pregnant. It is amazing to watch her and her 'hired man' move from total strangers 'in business' to an unexpected and very passionate love affair which opens a fresh world for Sophie, free from her husband's controlling nature.

Vera is absolutely magnificent as the passionate wife of a Korean American who wants desperately to give him the child that both he and his family expects. He's infertile, so she pays an illegal immigrant Korean to impregnate her, Jung Woo-ha (who is a well know actor in Korea), and what starts as business becomes something else entirely.

Anyways let me get on with this film and why it is worthy of being viewed. After stunning performances in films like Running Scared (2006) and The Boy With Striped Pajyamas (2008) and finally this film, I can safely vouch for  Vera Farmiga being one of the finest actresses in the film industry. (The story revolves around a faithful wife, her decisions for her family, never trying too hard to fit in despite being married to a Korean New Yorker) The visuals aren't particularly stunning but it was the music of the film that gave it a nice sentimental touch.

She went from thinking Never to Forever. I read that in Korea the title was A Second Love, or something similar. I love that their love won out in the end. I also love that this movie touched on SO many themes - immigration, abortion, religion, infidelity, suicide, class and wealth, etc. Bravo to the female writer/director.

8268374,2,B001840TU8,The whole notion of wanting to get pregnant by any means to save your husbands life and then leave him and go with your lover is utterly preposterous. The only redeeming factor is that her husband seemly was still alive when she left him and went overseas to Korea and have this and then a new baby. Happiness and loyalty is something else. And what about going to church and going through the motions? That was really a a waste of time. They did have the opportunity to get to know God and know His ways which are infinitely better that trying to do it all on your own.

Great cinematography with appropriate lighting (rare these days) for each scene. Very convincing acting by all 3 Stars.
I leave you with that; while I now go lose sleep trying to ""figure it out""; the Who with, What and Where of it all. One Star off because of this; it really has upset me not knowing ""Sophie's Choice"" in the end; causing unnecessary angst upon this viewer in the guise of ""art"".

After a failed suicide attempt by her husband she, out of desperation, decided to bare a child from another man without her husbands knowledge.  From there on the movie is a bit on the cliche side in that she falls for the hired man, husband finds out and she makes the discovery that instead of wanting the baby for her husband she wanted it for herself.
