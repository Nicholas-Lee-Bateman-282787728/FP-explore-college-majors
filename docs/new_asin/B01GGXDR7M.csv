7760221,4,B01GGXDR7M,"The Fatal 4-Way for the Tag Team Titles: The New Day (w/Xavier Woods) vs. Enzo & Cass vs. The Vaudevillains vs. Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson was a pretty good tag match with a hot ending although there were a few spots that were messed up in there. Im not a huge fan of the fatal fourway rules for a tag match because its too difficult to build up the big spots like they would in a regular tag match. The spot where Enzo almost won was pretty cool and the crowd was into it. As for New Day winning, I thought it might be a good time to put G&A over for the titles. I guess WWE disagreed because they chose to keep the gold on New Day. Theres nothing wrong with them. Its been ten months with them as the champs. I still think G&A will win the titles soon. The Baron Corbin vs. Dolph Ziggler match was a solid match that was very competitive. Corbin winning was no surprise. They told a good story in a big man/little man type match. This was their longest match or at least the longest one I can remember. Thats probably why they did it again because they felt like giving Corbin more of a chance to have a good match. Those boring chants aren't a good thing, though. Zigglers the right kind of opponent for Corbin because hes one of the best in WWE in terms of selling moves and making people look great in the ring. This feud has been about elevating Corbin. I think it definitely helped him, but whether hes elevated that much depends on what he does next. The Charlotte & Dana Brooke vs. Natalya & Becky Lynch tag match was a basic tag match that really didn't get enough time to allow them to stand out. Its pretty obvious that Brooke has a lot of work to do compared to the other three women. I don't mind Brooke, though. Shes done pretty well and keeps improving. The outcome surprised me a bituntil what happened after the match. The Sheamus vs. Apollo Crews match was a solid match to put over the younger guy in less than ten minutes. Crews showed his incredible athleticism a few times. In my preview of the match, I wrote about how I thought Crews was going to win in a manner that wasn't decisive, but could be considered more of a crafty win. Sheamus can call it a fluke. Its a way to keep the rivalry going. Thats exactly what happened. Sometimes WWE is predictable. Thats not a bad thing, though. That finish made sense for this story-line. The AJ Styles vs. John Cena match was an outstanding match as expected. It wasn't the match of the year, but its another incredible match by Styles on PPV. Hes on quite a roll while Cena hasn't missed a beat. I liked the pacing of the match because they were given nearly 25 minutes. Both guys have a lot of experience in a long match, so they took their time to make it work. I liked all of the great nearfalls they had like when Styles kicked out of the AA and Cena kicked out of a Styles Clash. The right man went over too as I predicted because Styles lost three straight PPV matches in a row, so he should have won. Im not surprised that it was a cheap win because Styles is the heel and thats how he should win a match like this. That finish also sets up the obvious rematch that should be just as good if not better than this one. The Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Cesaro vs. Sami Zayn vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Kevin Owens vs. Dean Ambrose was awesome. I loved that match. I don't remember my ratings for every MITB match, but that was definitely on the high end of MITB matches. Its one of the better ones for sure. They built it up really well with all six guys looking like they had a legit shot to win. I thought one of the better false finishes was Zayns climb when he had his hand on the briefcase, which led to others getting involved. He came so close a few times. Others did a swell. As for the result, I have no problem with Ambrose winning. For weeks I said it was probably going to be Owens or Ambrose. I ended up picking Ambrose because typically WWE doesnt book a guy to win matches before a big match, but in Deans case he won on both Raw and Smackdown. Im actually surprised they booked a guy to win matches leading up to a PPV win because its so rare. Thats what they should do more often, though. Great match. Awesome job by all six men. The United States Champion: Rusev vs. Titus ONeil was just okay. Going into it I thought ONeil was just a guy for Rusev to beat and thats really all he was. I don't see this feud continuing past this show. Its really not necessary. Its not like the crowd cares much either because there was no reaction to the nearfalls that ONeil was getting. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins was a great match. I liked how they went back and forth throughout the match with all kinds of believable nearfalls. Rollins was very impressive in his first back match since returning from injury. Im so glad hes back in action because hes one of the best performers in the company. Reigns did his best to keep up with Rollins, but it was pretty clear who was carrying this match. Thats not a knock on Reigns at all. I just think Rollins is at such a high level even after missing seven months with a serious knee injury. Reigns also worked like a heel for much of the match. Finishers were kicked out of just like in the Cena/Styles match. Reigns losing clean is a big shock and also losing the title in less than three months is an even bigger shock. I just figured it would be a lengthy title run for Reigns. I was actually surprised that Rollins won in a clean manner because I was expecting Reigns to kick out there. The surprise left me pretty quickly because of what was next. The Bonus WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins cash-in match was awesome. No rating for the match since it was so short and simple. What a moment for Ambrose. I didn't see it coming, but Im glad they did it. The crowd went wild for it while Im sitting here smiling because it was the right time for a change. While Im not a Reigns hater like some people are, it was pretty obvious that he wasn't connecting that well as champion. Ratings are down, attendance numbers aren't great and crowd reactions also show that people are tired of Reigns in this role. Moving the title onto Ambrose is the right move for right now. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1467849600,4,6318,4.248338870431894
7760222,5,B01GGXDR7M,"Really good MITB Ladder match and an epic match between Reigns and Rollins. I am shocked to be saying that about Reigns because it is Reigns, but his 3 post Mania title defenses (Payback, Extreme Rules, MITB) were pretty damn good and this one is awesome. Rollins is back at 100%",1467676800,,279,4.490196078431373
7760223,4,B01GGXDR7M,"Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Enzo Amore & Big Cass vs. Vaudvillians vs. Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson - It should be noted for those who pay attention to these things that the New Day had a ""insider"" reference to another dominate group in wrestling during their entrance as this was non-stop & fast paced with action that you would expect from opposing teams breaking up pinfalls, all eight brawling at one time, the action taking place both in & outside of the ring, each time having an opportunity to showcase themselves, and some teamwork between opponents in a good opening match with the only negative is that it was heavily obvious that their timing was off at some points.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Baron Corbin - Their series continues (the previous two matches on the last two Kickoff Shows) with Dolph using his superior quickness only for Corbin to showcase that he not only had some speed of his own & also power including a punch to almost knocked him out & kept staying one step ahead & having counters while Dolph continued to attempt to execute some of his trademark offense & even show that he had Corbin's number as well in a good match that was definitely Corbin's best performance since WrestleMania.

Natayla & Becky Lynch vs. Charlotte & Dana Brooke - Natayla & Becky were in control early showcasing some teamwork while Charlotte & Dana resorted to illegal tactics to regain & maintain control from distractions to working over in the corner while attempting to keeping one opponent isolated from her partner as it ultimately came down to one team taking advantage of a mistiming of the other in a solid match that was more significant for the aftermath.

Apollo Crews vs. Sheamus - This started off with a bang as the action got started before the bell & both men being aggressive in the ring & one taking it the next level on the floor as both men continued to trade momentum with Sheamus continuing to deliver physical strikes while Crews also showcased his athleticism leaving his feet for various offensive maneuvers along with his own power only for Sheamus to leave his feet himself in a solid physical match.

John Cena vs. A.J. Styles - The dream match started off with one man literally ""running circles around"" his opponent only to tossed on his behind as Styles showed that he had Cena scouted repeatedly countering his offense or taking a hit only to come right back & deliver one of his own stopping the momentum while Cena was able to have his own counters to A.J.'s offense including causing him to crash & burn on the floor as both men continued to trade momentum from submissions to their signature maneuvers along with series of unique reversals & counters from that I don't recall seeing in WWE before with both men showing effects of the match as time went on leading up without a doubt the one moment that definitely left a bad taste in everyone's mouth to the point where even the announce team were all on the same page as this was one of those cases where if you can get past the ending (depending on how you look at it) then this lived up to the expectations of a dream match.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Sami Zayn vs. Cesaro vs. Kevin Owens vs. Chris Jericho vs. Alberto Del Rio - This match started off as a 6 way brawl between everyone & didn't stop with various highlights such as the ladder being used either was a weapon including one man trapped inside it, an ""uppercut party only"" to be topped by another party of an offensive move, various signature offense performed on the ladder, one giant swing ending badly for the opponent, and eventually all six men fighting on ladders at the same time for the case in what was a great ladder match full of crazy & hard bumps.

United States Champion Rusev vs. Titus O'Neal - Titus had his sons at ringside with this PPV taking place on Father's Day only for Rusev to taunt them causing both men to come aggressive at each other on the outside taking each other out in the first move of the match only to continue using the environment around them before making their way back into the ring with Rusev heavily focusing on a specific area of the body & continuing to taunt his kids at ringside while Titus was able to use his opponent's momentum against him along with his own power to deliver offense & counter Rusev's in what was a good back & forth match that was the best I've ever seen Titus O'Neal outside of the Primetime Players.

WWE Champion Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins - Roman was able to keep showing up Seth with his superior power early on only for Seth to come at Roman with his superior speed with Roman being able to keep using his momentum against him or stopping it dead in it's tracks as he kept getting more & more physical to the point where the referee had to get physical himself to separate the two as they continued to trade momentum Roman continuing to use his power & other tactics including a version of the powerbomb I haven't previously seen while Seth had the speed & agility with aerial maneuvers coming off or over the top rope while both continued to avoid & counter the other's signature offense in a hard hitting bout...only for another man's earlier prediction on what would happen afterwords to be ""cashed in.""

(Kickoff Show) Golden Truth vs. Breezango - Tyler Breeze & Fandango came into this match heavily burned from being locked inside the tanning booth earlier in the week to the point where they were extra sensitive whenever they were touched from Truth & Goldust chopping them to even tagging their partners in a basic tag match that was strictly played for silliness but also gave a long overdue moment for Goldust & R-Truth.

(Kickoff Show) Lucha Dragons vs. Dudley Boyz - The Dudleys attempted to lure one of their opponents into their corner early on only for it not to work at the Dragons delivered their fast paced lucha libre influenced style with different aerial moves from different positions of the ring either individually or as a team while the Dudleys were able to take advantage of an opening singling out one opponent working over a part of the body neutralizing their superior speed in a solid match that could have been better if given more time.

It should be noted that WWE went into overtime (similar to WrestleMania) with the event itself going 3.5 hours plus the kickoff matches as they kept advertising this as the best Money In The Bank PPV & I have to say that there have been better matches on previous events but this was definitely the best card (but not perfect) from start to finish I can remember as you had a mix of everything while some superstars stepped up & gave the best performances I've seen from them in recent memory which I recommend for a viewing.",1467072000,2,6755,4.556836902800659

MONEY IN THE BANK 2016

This was labeled the biggest MITB event of all time due to a few Westlemania worthy matches on the card. I thought going in that may be a true statement because the potential was definitely there.

1. THE GOLDEN TRUTH VS BREEZANGO-this was a perfect match for the pre show. This was more of a comedy/entertainment match as it was all about The Golden Truth finally getting a win in a funny match against some very burnt up opponents in Tyler Breeze and Fandango. Good entertainment factor for this match in a fun win for The Truth.

2. THE DUDLEY BOYZ VS THE LUCHA DRAGONS-the final match on the pre show was another tag match, I love that. This was more of a competitive match but ultimately was another chance for The Dudleys to put over a younger team. A good match over all that had both teams look good, nice way to end the pre show leading into a fatal four way tag title match.

3.[TAG TITLE FATAL 4 WAY]THE NEW DAY VS THE CLUB VS THE VAUDE VILLIANS VS ENZO & CASS-we open up the PPV with another tag match, this one for the titles and also a fatal four way. I was super excited for this match as I enjoy all of the teams here, especially The New Day. I can honestly say I have liked them since the beginning, my reviews from that time period will show that. This was an excellent opener for the main card as all four teams really brought it here. Everyone had time to shine and the match even got the this is awesome chant from the crowd. This was a super fun match with New Day retaining.

4. DOLPH ZIGGLER VS BARON CORBIN-this was a much better match than it gets credit for, including the live audience. The crowd at one point chanted boring, whatever, this match is good. This was a good back and forth match that continued the feud between these two as Ziggler was given the task of making Corbin look good. He did a great job helping the newer talent out because I really enjoyed this match even with Corbin getting the win.

5. CHARLOTTE & DANA BROOKE VS NATALYA & BECKY LYNCH-the final tag match of the night was between four women who had been feuding as of late. My all time favorite female Nattie teamed with Becky to do battle with champ Charlotte and her protg Brooke. This was a good match with all four ladies doing their thing here. The classic heels versus face match with  a great ending in my opinion that lead to Charlotte and Brooke getting the victory. But it was after the match that Nattie turned heel and attacked Becky, viciously, I loved it.

6. SHEAMUS VS APOLLO CREWS-this was another very good match that doesnt get the credit it deserves. This was a good back and forth brawl that lead to Crews taking a hard fought victory. This was more of a hard hitting fight that I thought really made both look pretty good, although the lead in was nothing special other than a TMNT 2 commercial for Sheamus.

7. AJ STYLES VS JOHN CENA-the crowd was so into this match even before it started, it was something special to see and hear. It started just right as well as the match felt like it was building up though out. It seems like every time these two work together it turns into one of my favorite matches of the night. This was an excellent encounter between the two that was being billed as a dream match worthy of Wrestlemania, which it is and was. The action was great as both men would work over the other and also each hit some great counters. Of course as you all knew it would in the end The Club would get involved after the ref was taken out. I know a lot of people hated this ending that lead to an AJ victory but I thought that it felt old school heel.

8.[MONEY IN THE BANK LADDER MATCH]DEAN AMBROSE VS ALBERTO DEL RIO VS CHRIS JERICHO VS KEVIN OWENS VS CESARO VS SAMI ZAYN-these matches are always fun to watch. You always get crazy brawls and a ton of high spots. This was no exception as all six of these men went hard and also took some big bumps. There are countless times ladders are used including a moment in which there were all on ladders battling it out. It would be the Lunatic that would climb the ladder and get the win which I thought was smart, he is one of the most over wrestlers on the roster. Ambrose winning was huge as the crowd was so into him, of course it wouldnt be the last time they saw him that night.

9.[US TITLE]RUSEV VS TITUS ONEIL-ONeil who has won awards for being a great father was going after the title in front of his kids that night, a win would have been a great Fathers Day moment for his family. This was a good match that really showcased Titus as a guy who had the potential to pull off the upset. Great back and forth action between the two with his kids at ringside adding to the drama as Rusev played to that. Titus would have to tap out but it was a good showing for both.

10.[WWE TITLE]ROMAN REIGNS VS SETH ROLLINS-the crowd was very much against Reigns here as the heel Seth Rollins was favored by the crowd. This was a really good match with both Rollins and Reigns doing a great job here. Both men do a great job here with Reigns taking it to the former champ who never lost and Rollins fighting like he never left. Great back and forth battle that crowd was really into and they loved it when Seth won the match and his title back. But when that music hit for Ambrose they went crazy.

11.[WWE TITLE]SETH ROLLINS VS DEAN AMBROSE-this was a very short match as Ambrose hit Seth with the MITB case and then laid him out with the Dirty Deeds DDT. He would then get the quick pin and win the title. In one night all three members of the Shield held the title, I loved it.

This was a fun event as all of them mostly are. I would highly recommend this DVD to any wrestling fan out there.",1471392000,,5709,4.230486685032139
