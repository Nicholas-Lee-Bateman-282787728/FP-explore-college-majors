I show it in class!",1385164800,,144,5.041666666666667
8435877,4,B004M9QNSI,"I thoroughly enjoy documentaries that pertain to the earth and how it may have been created. I say ""may"" simply because the science isn't settled yet. Just like the issue of climate change (or whatever the flavor of the day is to call it), there are scientists who argue to the contrary of what is claimed. However, these documentaries force me to think; and to me that is the most important thing. Every group has an angle or axe to grind, but they can't force me to accept their ideologies if they don't hold water.",1363824000,,517,4.4526315789473685

As long as the station H2 exists and there is shows like the Underwater Universe, any shows about unwater sea life or just about real history itself, I know I will love it!",1359072000,,243,4.5227272727272725
8435879,3,B004M9QNSI,I think this is the second disk in the season one box. This is being recommended for me because I bought that but that may be a glitch in the system.,1333411200,,149,3.838709677419355
