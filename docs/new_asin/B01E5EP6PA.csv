8757701,5,B01E5EP6PA,"This captivating Israeli television series about an ultra-orthodox family of a widower and his adult children has two seasons.  Can the youngest, live-at-home son in his late 20s find true love?  Its gentle pacing and engaging lead of Michael Aloni endear the series to the viewer.  The first season is dominated by the would-be romance between the son (played by then 29-year old Aloni) and a widow (played splendidly by then 44-year old Ayelet Zurer).  The second season focusses on two other star-crossed romances.  Dov Glickman plays the infuriating 62-year-old father, whose oblivious, self-righteous meddling repeatedly causes broken hearts, embarrassment, and shattered hopes.  Luckily, the younger generations nonetheless seem to come out OK.  Its not as friendly as Srugim, but a fine production.  Amazon reportedly picked up the shows rights and plans to remake it in Brooklyn under the title Emmis.  It will be interesting to see if the American version will convey all the heartache of the Israeli original.",1530662400,,1019,5.31875

8757705,5,B01E5EP6PA,"I'm in love with Israeli T.V.!  I binged in two nights the three seasons of Srguim which I adored and then in search for more Jewish T.V. with English subtitles I found this gem!  I love that the Israelis can do shows about faith, pure simple, loving faith and not make it seem like There is No God II.  You actually truly care about these people and the choices they make and the strength of their beliefs.  Should the lead Rabbi paint or give it up to be a ""good Jew""?  It is that simple.  And the ""answer"" so far is complicated.  I truly hope for a season 3 as I'd like to see more resolution.  I also recommend on Netflix that you watch Fauda which makes Homeland seem like a PG Disney film.  Yes is the Israeli production company and they are turning out winner after winner and this show is at the top of the list.  Give yourself a nudge and try this show or if you are on Prime watch Srguim and then watch this.  You will love it.  Mazel Tov.",1490745600,8,949,4.0978260869565215
