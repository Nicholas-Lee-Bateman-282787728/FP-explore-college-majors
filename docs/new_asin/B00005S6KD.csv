7953360,3,B00005S6KD,"COP ON A MISSION
[Zhi Fa Fan Fa]

(Hong Kong - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

An undercover cop (Daniel Wu Yin-cho) rises through the ranks of a powerful Triad gang and is corrupted by delusions of grandeur.

Taking the director's chair for only the third time in his career, former editor Marco Mak Chi-sin (ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, THE STORM RIDERS, etc.) overcomes the drawbacks of limited funding to make a powerful statement about the corruptive nature of Absolute Power and the consequences of poverty on a divided heart.

Though the budget allows for only a handful of major set-pieces (choreographed by action director Ma Yuk-sing), the plot is buoyed by skillful editing and a busy narrative, and is further energized by three standout performances: Wu is superb as the undercover cop whose worldview is transformed by the gangster lifestyle (leading to a number of surprising plot twists), while veteran entertainer Eric Tsang Chi-wai makes a virtue of restraint as the murderous Triad leader - rendered impotent following a bloody gang battle - who takes Wu under his wing. Suki Kwan Sau-mei plays Tsang's beautiful wife, torn between loyalty to her beloved husband and the earthier charms of Wu's carnal embrace.

There's a deliberate emphasis on Wu's physical beauty during the film's early stages, though the loving attention paid to his naked torso (alongside a couple of nude shower scenes) serves a dual purpose: To promote Wu as a rising star in the HK movie firmament, and to reinforce the audience's rapport with a sympathetic character, which makes his slow descent into immorality and murder all the more disturbing. Mak references other films with relish (SUNSET BLVD. and THE UNTOUCHABLES are two of the most obvious), and he manages to combine a character-driven storyline with stylish visuals (excellent work by cinematographer Tony Miu King-fai), despite the limitations imposed by a lack of financial resources.

Also starring David Lee Wai-sheung (DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART) as a fellow cop and one of Wu's closest friends, Karel Wong Chi-yeung (THE JAIL OF NO RETURN) as a psychopathic gang leader whose violent behavior prompts Wu's slide into debasement, and Lam Suet as a wannabe Triad member who bears the brunt of Wu's dishonorable conduct. Tense, dramatic, and emotionally satisfying, COP ON A MISSION is a fine addition to the HK crime genre.",1255132800,,2405,5.104325699745547
7953361,5,B00005S6KD,"Daniel Wu was a hopeless cop. Eric Tsang Chi Wai is the chief of Hong Kong mafia (Hung Heng). Suki Kwan Sau Mei (Pauline) was the wife of Eric Tsang. Suki Kwan Sau Mei has always acted as big mafia's wife. Only Suki Kwan Sau Mei has the kind of quality to portray a beautiful, intelligent, and powerful woman.

Daniel Wu was having breakfast in a restaurant with her annoying girl friend. Eric Tsang was having gathering with other mafia bosses. Eric Tsang is very proud to bring Suki Kwan Sau Mei with him wherever he goes (who wouldn't). Suki Kwan Sau Mei will socialize with other bosses. All the other bosses will only envy Eric Tsang, not for his powerful status but his beautiful woman. As the most powerful man in Hong Kong and a triad leader, Eric Tsang never goes for prostitution. Suki Kwan Sau Mei has it all.

Suddenly, wines are spill at Suki Kwan Sau Mei's dress. The captain quickly escorts Suki Kwan Sau Mei to a room to clean up. Daniel Wu accidentally entered the room and peep at Suki Kwan Sau Mei. Suki Kwan Sau Mei undressed and started wiping her body. Suki Kwan Sau Mei was so sexy. Daniel Wu was very high.

After that night, Daniel Wu is obsessed with Suki Kwan Sau Mei. He masturbates and thinks about Suki Kwan Sau Mei's dazzling look and sexy body. Daniel was asked to go into Eric's triad as undercover. One night, Suki Kwan Sau Mei came out from a nightclub and few people attempt to attack Suki Kwan Sau Mei. Daniel quickly protects Suki Kwan Sau Mei from being wound and sensibly uses his own body to wrap the entire stab. Whoever who is attempting to hurt Suki Kwan Sau Mei is insane.

Daniel Wu gained the trust of Eric Tsang. One day, in Macau, the triad boss took Suki Kwan Sau Mei as hostage and asked Eric Tsang for a negotiation. Eric Tsang send Daniel Wu there and even instructed not to lose face even if it means losing Suki Kwan Sau Mei's life. Eric Tsang is really insane for saving his face to sacrifice Suki Kwan Sau Mei.

Anyway, Daniel Wu is determined to save Suki Kwan Sau Mei. When Daniel Wu went in to the room, Suki Kwan Sau Mei was being tied up. The boss said, Eric Tsang has the greatest woman in the globe, and he's not treasuring her for sending such jerk for negotiation. He asked his men to rape her. Suki Kwan Sau Mei was very scared. Then, the boss offered a deal to ask Daniel to have sex with Suki Kwan Sau Mei in front of all his men and he will let them go. Daniel agreed with the offer. Who wouldn't? The other entire guy was erotic to see such scene. They all want to have sex with Suki Kwan Sau Mei. While paying undivided attention to the act, Daniel's men arrived and killed all of them. Beauty is saved.

When Suki Kwan Sau Mei came back to meet Eric, Eric does not want to talk to her. Suki Kwan Sau Mei was surprised. With her sexy tone, she said ""Eric."" but Eric asked her to go away. Suki Kwan Sau Mei was totally stunned. This is really unreasonable. Suki Kwan Sau Mei was in such a dangerous situation and Eric did not send his whole troops to rescue her. Now, Suki Kwan Sau Mei is back with no scratch! Eric should be down on her knees kissing every inch of Suki Kwan Sau Mei. Suki Kwan Sau Mei even lean her face towards him but he rejected her?

Suki went out of the room and have sex with Daniel. But later, Eric found out her secret. Suki admitted that she had sex with Daniel. Under tradition, as the woman of the head of triad, Suki should be brutally punished to death. Of course, Eric let her go without even harming her or scolded her. That's the kind of privilege no other woman can get.

At the end, Eric found out Daniel's plan of betraying him and wanted to burry him alive. Daniel begged for help. He begged Suki to ask Eric to let him go. Eric said ""If Pauline (Suki) says so, he'll live"". Again, only Suki can order the boss to change his directive order in front of all his people. But, Suki didn't help and just let him die.

Daniel's first erotic dream came from looking at Suki's face. The last image he sees before dying was also the beautiful Suki. Considered a very lucky man.",1098835200,4,4078,4.251612903225807
7953362,5,B00005S6KD,"The new Hong Kong movies usually aren't that great.  The triad theme has been done to death in Hong Kong and the new stuff doesn't hold a candle to the older Chow Yun-Fat movies.  This movie is quite a suprise though.  A real good cast of characters with new Hong Kong star Daniel Wu, an ABC from the bay area.  I think this is one of his first starring roles.  Either this one or ""Gen X Cops"".  Anyway, the theme of the movie is quite intriguing and with the good undercover cop becoming a hardcore triad leader.  I rather liked the ending when Daniel Wu's character gets his 'reward' for being such a jerk.  Anyway,it is quite cool that ABCs are making it big in Hong Kong cinema.  Anya Wu another Chinese American is in the film.  I think this is a great movie and it kept me interested through out the duration of the film.",1089331200,3,827,4.243589743589744
7953363,2,B00005S6KD,"Hong Kong cop (Daniel Wu, sporting better Cantonese than Michael Wong) goes undercover to bust Triad chief (Eric Tsang) and other mob bosses. The problems are that (a) he likes money, (b) he likes watching the boss's wife undress, and (c) he likes to kill. Maybe you can guess where this is going?
Well, Wu takes a lot of showers, and Tsang doesn't fully abandon his clownish nature (I'm not a fan of his comedy work). These two create more full rounded characters than your usual HK crime story, but there's not much else besides that to recommend here. There's one nice theme song used on the soundtrack, but there's a lot of jazz that I did not appreciate.
At least Tai Seng has provided a nice, clean letterboxed picture with removable English subtitles.  There are also some trailers and an audio commentary.",1013472000,,813,4.685314685314685
