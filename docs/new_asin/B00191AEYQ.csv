Still worthwhile but it's too bad the series didn't continue or end on a stronger note.  It feels like a show that could have been really good.",1231718400,2,267,4.782608695652174
3422282,5,B00191AEYQ,"I never seen this show while it ran for a little over a season, but I caught a glimpse of a re-run and fell in love with it. I ordered the complete series on DVD here off of Amazon. I started watching the series, and could not get enough of it. The characters all blended well, and I have NO idea why this show was canceled. It should have ran for many more years. Eliza Dushku as Tru did an amazing heart felt job in every episode. I don't think a better actress could be found for this part. Jason Priestley as Jack was simply  amazing. I found myself agreeing with the character ""Jack"" in his outlook on what he did to preserve the laws of fate.
Shawn Reaves as Harrison, the half bad boy good guy of the show made for an entertaining watch. Shawn Reaves as Davis was outstanding in his performance, I always thought he had a ""thing"" for Tru, and I can't blame him.  I enjoyed the whole premise of this show. All in all a great show, and worth watching.",1231718400,37,956,4.162162162162162
3422283,5,B00191AEYQ,"Imagine having the power to not only save lives, but to alter fate and destiny. Tru Davies, in this series, has the power to rewind a day and save the life of someone who was taken away before their time.

Eliza Dushku stars in ""Tru Calling"" as Tru Davies. Tru works at the morgue. She frequently gets whispers from corpses that come into the morgue. At first, the whispers are soft, but they increase in urgency as the severity of each case increases.

They usually ask her to 'save them', which then causes Tru's day to rewind and she is forced to relive the day until the person asking for help is saved. Sometimes Tru is forced to search extra hard to find clues to save each individual person, and sometimes Tru is forced to save more than one person.

The show really picks up once Tru discovers she has an opposite. Jason Priestly enters the show as the character Jack, who has all the powers that Tru has; the ability to talk to the dead and to rewind and relive days. However, unlike Tru, he chooses to use his powers to prevent Tru from saving people. He believes that there was a reason why they died.

Unfortunately, this was when Fox decided to axe the show, so this show has no real conclusion at the moment.",1231200000,11,1222,4.370044052863436

3422285,5,B00191AEYQ,"I loved this show when it was on tv. I don't understand why FOX didn't give it a chance before they pulled the plug on it. Eliza Dushku is an amazing actress. I've liked her ever since she was on Buffy. When I saw both seasons of this show together for a cheaper price than the 2 individually, I snapped it up  right away.",1228003200,2,322,4.03125
3422286,5,B00191AEYQ,"I missed this series the first time. I saw a few episodes in rerun and got hooked. It's quite enjoyable, and I'm thankful it was available from Amazon.",1224374400,2,151,4.428571428571429
3422287,5,B00191AEYQ,"Very sad that Fox cancelled the series. It was great and really had me wanting to learn more about the characters. Great writers and actors. ""Tru"" miscalculation on Fox's part.",1220659200,2,176,4.9
3422288,3,B00191AEYQ,"I bought this sight unseen because I like Eliza Dushku.  The series is good because of her.  Her boss is OK too.

The bad... Jason Priestly and the loser brother.  I was hoping Jason Priestly would have faded into oblivion after that 90210 show.  His character on this show is annoying.  His acting also seems to be inspired by a visit to a lumberyard.

The brother.  Major loser.  Always losing money by gambling.  Always, always, always does the wrong thing.  The epitome of selfish.  His routine gets very old very fast.

It looks as if someone watched ""Run Lola Run"" and thought it would be a great concept for a TV series.  It's easy to see why this show didn't run longer.

Bottom line.... if you are an Eliza Dushku fan, buy this.  If not, pass.",1219017600,6,752,4.419117647058823
3422289,1,B00191AEYQ,"This review is not of the show itself, but of the DVD package. I just find it's a shame this complete series is already available (and has been for some time) from the other Amazon UK site for a lot less cash (cost about $30)!  Even with shipping added, it's still less.  Just have a DVD player that plays other regions [like I do] and you're all set!",1218326400,5,351,4.147058823529412
3422290,5,B00191AEYQ,"""Tru Calling"" was a television show that ran for 1 season on Fox before being abruptly canceled prior to the airing of the first six completed episodes of what was shaping up to be a phenomenal second season.  Well, at least it fared better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>.  Sorry, it still hurts.  The show starred girl-of-my-dreams Eliza Dushku (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel/dp/B000TLTCU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel</a>&nbsp;fame) as a morgue attendant, Tru Davies, who gains a unique supernatural power.  The dead bodies she attends occasionally ask her for help and she finds herself instantly transported back to the moment she awoke that morning and charged with saving the life of the corpse she just encountered.  It's a simple set-up for what proves to be a formulaic but very entertaining show that deserved much better than it got.

Honestly, Eliza Dushku herself is reason enough to go out and buy this.  The girl is just a joy to watch onscreen.  She has girl-next-door likability, great acting talent, plenty of attitude, and a damn sexy voice. Also: quite pretty, yes?  But the writing for ""Tru Calling"" is also top-notch and manages to keep things interesting at all times in spite of the episodic nature of the stories.  You'll be surprised at how inventive and compelling some of the stories are.  One finds Tru reliving the same day four separate times as every night after saving the life, another corpse turns up as a result and sends her back to the start.  Others have her juggling her duty with finagling her ne'er-do-well of a brother out of whatever idiotic situation he's gotten himself into or attempting to save people close to her. Yet another has her charged with saving two lives on the same day, a monumental task considering the amount of investigation, resourcefulness, and work it takes to save the life of one person you don't know anything about aside from cause of death.  The supporting cast is also outstanding including Tru's boss (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/0618346244/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;nerd), and her exceptionally dysfunctional family. Just how dysfunctional?  I couldn't possibly tell you without massive spoilers.

The real story for the show begins when Tru finds out that she has an opposite.  Jason Priestly takes the show by storm as Jack, a man whose day rewinds every time our heroine's does and is charged with making sure those on a collision course with death stay that way.  Tru is then forced to examine her place in the world and wonder if she is, as Jack says, doing more harm than good by disrupting the natural order of things.  The come the bombshells.  The last part of Season 1 gathers massive momentum that carries over into Season 2 and you curse Fox's stupidity for killing yet another great show at it's creative peak when the last episode is done and you're left pondering what could have been.

""Tru Calling"" was an outstanding series for fans of supernatural television and I'm still ticked off that it's gone.  Instead we got endless ""reality"" shows -each more inane and derivative than the last-, more and more formulaic crime and medical dramas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B0009WPM1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D.</a>&nbsp;rocks, though), and fluff like ""Medium"" and ""Ghost Whisperer"" (no links for you!). And when we do get real deal supernatural television it's on-the-bubble shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reaper/dp/B0012Q72WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reaper</a>&nbsp;that are great and so you fear every week of hearing about their cancellation.  This is no kind of life for a fan to live, man!  Speak up about your favorite shows when those rumors start swirling.  One email to the network can be a drop in an ocean of support that saves the shows you love.  Check ""Tru Calling"" out if the notion of a macabre, heroic version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day/dp/B000Z8GZYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day</a>&nbsp;starring Miss Dushku appeals to you in any way.

3422316,4,B00191AEYQ,"It is ""true"" this is a little cheezy but,  the premise is fun. I love Tru (Eliza Dushku's acting is MUCH better in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, heartbreakingly well crafted in Angel, and superior in the Doll House.) The best actor in this series, the one that you wish had the lead in his own show is the little brother, Harrison. He and Tru are VERY believable as brother and sister and their relationship is probably why the show lasted as long as it did. Tru's boss, Davis is another character worth watching and I don't even know why. He plays the intelligent but awkward friend.

Tru Calling is sort of like Early Edition, but more edgy and entertaining to watch.  Tru relives days to save someone's life, but it is more than that.  There are always obstacles in her way making the save difficult.  For example, one episode she doesn't know who died.  Her biggest challenge is her rival Jack.  Tru thinks she relives days because she is meant to save lives.  Jack thinks he relives days to ensure that fate continues the way it was meant to be.

So the only bummer is this show got cancelled before airing season 2.  Season 2 came straight to DVD and ends with an unresolved story- leaving you wanting more.  :/  Other than that great show :)",1409097600,2,679,4.483606557377049

3422351,5,B00191AEYQ,"Bought the entire series after a tip from a friend (and his wife and daughter). Only watched 4 episodes so far but I am hooked. This show is fabulous. It has the sci fi elements (dead people communicating; a full day in the life of the star being replayed, etc.) and great pacing and drama as well. The stories grab your attention right away and the acting is top notch. It's really a simple but very well thought out premise that the show is buit upon and it is very perplexing how this show could have been canceled after only 2 seasons. I'm particularly impressed with the writers as they have the time to develop the characters without affecting the storyline. The episodes seem to get better each time out which is a hallmark of a great show.

I can't wait to watch the remaining 22 episodes. This show is a keeper. I highly recommend it. It is unique as it appeals to many different genre lovers (sci fi, drama, crime, investigation). Eliza Dushku is a phenomenal actress and Shawn Reaves is amazing as well. This show is TRUly deserving of 5 stars.",1322179200,5,1055,4.466321243523316

3422354,5,B00191AEYQ,"I hadn't seen this show before I ordered it, but I was a big fan of Eliza Dushku so I figured what the heck..

Well I started watching them and was hooked, the characters were entertaining and engaging - I really liked it and watched through the whole series. Loved 'em! I think they were starting to get better and more interesting as the series progressed - then of course the show was cancelled and we were left semi-hanging.

I hate it when good shows get the ax before they even get the chance to wrap up the storyline. But for that I purely blame Fox..
Do yourself a favor though if you're looking for a good series to watch, this was the first series that I know of that had this kind of idea of a premise (now there's been several copy cat types):

The main character Tru works in a morgue, when some of the dead start to say 'help me' and suddenly she wakes up that same morning - her day will rewind and she has to figure out how they died, who killed them, where they were and use all this to figure out how to save them from their fate.",1313366400,3,1048,4.102439024390244
3422355,5,B00191AEYQ,"Bearing in mind that TRU CALLING is science fiction set within the framework of the paranormal, you're guaranteed to love this regrettably short-lived TV series, so long as you can accept the ""preposterous"" premise on which it is built (i.e., heroine Eliza Dushku waking up each episode in a visionary world and experiencing the premonitory death of various individuals, so that when she reawakens in the real world, she may -- with help from the assorted clues gathered from the ""previous day"" -- save their lives.

Although the show became somewhat formulaic, its novelty and creative plot twists hardly ever failed to sustain my interest.

Despite its premature (viewer-left-hanging) cancellation on the part of Fox's unconscionable executives, I wouldn't have missed this series for the world.",1312329600,,797,5.317460317460317

And yes, you can say that I didn't watch it at the time, but in getting the ""complete"" series for Christmas from my grandchildren, I expected more in the series than a ""dead end.

3422358,5,B00191AEYQ,"I didn't have very high hopes for this show.  I bought it for the main reasons that it was on sale when I got it, and that Joss Whedon really liked the show, and of course Eliza is very pretty, but I tend to shy away from shows because of the eye candy, and after tolerating dollhouse, I was really skeptical on her ability to carry a show with less tallented people behind the camera than would be present for Joss, and I have to tell you that though the premise is almost generic, and the scale much smaller than doll house, the execution if far better pulled off.  It manages to have a lot of attention to detail which keeps your mind working, which is really cool for a kind of show that focuses on the changes the main character makes by living the second day twice.  I agree with many of the other reviewers in saying that the plot twist half way through with having her nemesis, who tries to not have anything change.  Where it appears to Tru that he is out to kill people, to her enemy, they are already dead, and might eventually change things for the worse, and everything happens for a reason, and uses many of the same tricks that she does, and though he definately crosses a line in the season 1 finale, but i think if the show had gone on any longer that it would have become more and more ambiguous.  I don't want to ruin any of the surprises, and its a bit of a tease, but I have to say that it was worth it to watch for me, especially if you can get a good deal on it.",1306368000,3,1485,4.0893470790378

3422360,5,B00191AEYQ,"I saw one episode of this show several years ago and captivated me immediately. I liked the plot and the performances so I kept watching the series and I was upset when they canceled it.

The series shows the history of Tru Davies (eliza dushku), a common girl who gets a job at the morgue and in addition to fulfilling their normal work, has the peculiar task of saving the lives of the bodies upon request. Once a corpse appears, and asks for help, Tru's Day restarts , giving her the opportunity to change the events that led to the death of that person.

The secondary characters play their role exceptionally, and add a dose of humor and drama that keeps the show entertaining.

The role of the villain, is well structured, in my opinion, and adds that element of mystery and at times makes us question the work of Tru.

The plot may sound repetitive and silly to some, but the way it is written, makes them interesting stories that keep the viewer wanting more.

The second season has an arc that would completely shake up the series. Unfortunately, we were left with the desire to see what happened.

We were fortunate that FOX decided to release a version of the complete series on DVD at a no reasonable price, if you consider the the number of discs and episodes. I lasted a long time deciding whether to buy the series, since they sold it in two sets, one per season.

These kind of shows makes you wonder what kind of people work in those networks , that can't realize the pottential of a particular show.

If you're a fan of TRU CALLING, this is the set you should buy and if you're not, you will definitely become one.",1294012800,2,1632,4.416666666666667

The dead bodies that come into the morgue asks Tru for her help so she relives the days to try and help them survive. She has to go back and try to find clues as to who is trying to kill the people or how the wreck happens so she can prevent it from happening. After a few episodes Tru starts telling people that she helps the dead including her Brother Harrison and the morgue worker Davis and they help her solve the cases. Towards the end of the first season a guy name Jack comes in and there is conflict between Tru and Jack because she tries to save the souls and Jack tries to prevent her from doing her job.
