I enjoy the DVD as well, but am a tad sad that it only contains seven music video. But being a huge Big Bang fan, some videos are better than no videos at all. You get some of their earliest songs and some newer ones in the mix, great for a longtime fan.",1452384000,,382,3.7875

The CD itself contains 20 songs of theirs and the two DVDs contain 7 music videos in total. Besides lack of videos in the DVDs and not having more current songs it was really great.",1369008000,,423,4.108433734939759
