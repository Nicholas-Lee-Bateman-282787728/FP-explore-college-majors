5024188,4,B006WNSHZO,"I remember this show from when I was an early teen. I was always a fan of the character of Sherlock Holmes but could never get into Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books at that age. Then this cartoon came along. Being a scifi geek I gravitated towards it. It continues where the books ended with Holmes and Moriarty dying together over a waterfall but instead Holmes managed to save himself. He continued his career in secret until he died at a ripe old age. His remains, which were perserved in honey, are reanimated in the future when it turns out 22nd century criminals have cloned Moriarty. Inspector Lestrad is replaced by his great great great granddaughter and lovable Dr. Watson is replaced by an android with his complete works and journals downloaded in it's harddrive. The three then track Moriarty and solve various cases modeled after each original Holmes story... Hounds of Baskervilles, The Red Headed League, etc. with a futuristic twist. Great for kids who love scifi and want to try a little classic literature too and great for adults because it's still quite intelligent and very entertaining. My only complaint about this wonderful show is it didn't last longer. Enjoy.

Funny Fact: Doyle never intended to write the last Sherlock Holmes book. He wanted to leave the characters of Holmes and Moriarty in an eternal chase..one never catching the other as a metaphor for the never ending struggle of good and evil. But his publishers and fans badgered him relentlessly for years to at least finish off the series with some sort of closure. So he did. He killed them both off out of pure spite. Haha.",1328140800,36,1612,4.777777777777778

An interesting twist on Sherlock Holmes. Clearly, not at the level of Basil Rathbone, or Jeremy Brett, but very good entertainment nevertheless.

5024205,5,B006WNSHZO,"I love the series, a majority of the episodes draw inspiration from the original stories by Sir Author Conan Doyle, so every episode has something interesting to it. My only pet peeve is that the episodes are not in the correct order, but that's just a petty issue; really doesn't take away from the overall of the show. I'd recommend this if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes.

I saw in some reviews that there was an issue with one of the episodes, but that seems to have been fixed, as I had no issues with any of the DVDs or episodes.",1447459200,,536,4.254901960784314

5024255,5,B006WNSHZO,"This is a fun take on the Sherlock Holmes mythos with robots and flying cars. This show finds fun new takes on the original Doyle stories.

This cartoon was made by DiC which is not my favorite company. Hanna Barbera and Filmation ruled in the 70's and 80's. DiC started in the 80's and did the cartoons Hanna Barbera would have done in the 90's, had they not been bought by Ted Turner.

Mill Creek, through their Cookie Jar and Retro TV Tune imprints, are putting out some well deserved budget priced complete season and complete series sets. They do cram 10-13 episodes per disc, but compared to a few 52 episodes on 2 DVD sets of various Kamen Rider series I have recently purchased for Singapore, there is no discernable loss in image quality in these Mill Creek releases.

This 4 DVD set and the 4 DVD set of Archie's Weird Mysteries do come on a Spindle DVD case that stacks the discs, but flippy ddvd cases are not hard to come by and reasonably priced if you buy several.

I hope Millcreek continues to put out these great sets, especially Seasons 2 and 3 of Jumanji.",1425254400,,1075,4.414141414141414

5024297,5,B006WNSHZO,"I am an adult that likes really good animations (comics and some cartoons).
Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century is not too serious, has a touch of fun and many good adventure stories in this one season [I have notice that if writers take away people hating people they replace it with some people hating robots it is almost like some people have to have something to hate].
I found this animation on the internet but it is easier to travel sometimes with just a DVD player so I ordered my own copy that I can view or listen to when ever I want. Thank you Amazon for sale it to me and Thank you everyone who made Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century possible.",1403481600,,657,4.264
5024298,4,B006WNSHZO,"I used to watch this show several years ago.  I never saw the whole series so I was pretty happy when I found the DVD version.  While it is simply a series of individual episodes (none of the episodes really build up to a single goal/story for the final episode), it has left some room for expansion if an ambitious person wanted to go for more mysteries.",1401408000,,355,4.2835820895522385
5024299,5,B006WNSHZO,"this show is fun and i was so happy to find it complete on DVD. clever and fun, though unless you've seen this before it WILL seem dated and has bits where you can see that it was not made with a realistic future in mind, nor the idea of how Holmes, would process being brought into the future, but it really is fun and, in my opinion, a great show!",1399939200,,349,3.9295774647887325
5024300,5,B006WNSHZO,I chose the rating of 5 stars because the purchase exceeded my expectations.  I expected the delivery to arrive in 6 to 10 days - it arrived in 5.  I expected the disk cover to appear a bit worn - it arrived in pristine condition.  I decided I would be content if at least half of the 26 segments met my desire for an exciting contemporary animated tale - I enjoyed each one.,1396742400,,375,4.109589041095891

5024304,5,B006WNSHZO,I ordered this series on DVD recently and found no problems with it of the sort described in some of the other reviews. Whatever glitches there may have been in copies purchased in the past they seem to have been fixed.

5024307,5,B006WNSHZO,"If you loved reading Sherlock Holmes, you will probably love this series!  The creators cunningly found a way to move Sherlock Holmes into the 22nd Century and then created stories to match up with the basic premise of the original stories, but placed 300 or so years later!

This was created in 1999, so the aspect ratio is based on the old 4:3 television standard.  Still, it is a lot of fun and I think well worth the price for 26 episodes.  Since you are viewing the original made for TV, you will still see the pauses that were inserted for networks to place their advertising in, but there will be no advertising.  Figure about 22 minutes per episode instead of the 30 you would have on TV since the commercials are missing.

A well thought out and implemented adaptation that preserves two of the main characters and finds interesting ways to recreate two other prime characters.

I would highly recommend it.",1389744000,,916,4.617283950617284

5024310,5,B006WNSHZO,"Fun rethink of the detective and his crew. if I were doing a revamp and setting it in the future, I would do this. not for those who are purists, this show is for those who like to have a little fun with a classic character and see where you go with it.

So when I looked at other reviews to see if anyone else had the same problem and what they did about it, one reviewer said he or she contacted the company and was sent a replacement disk. So, I emailed the company and explained the problem. Millcreek is wonderful! They too sent me a replacement DVD and it works wonderfully. I rewound the problem scene where it skips just to make sure and no problem.

Before long I found myself watching it just for the fun of it, because I had read the originals many times over.  Because of this knowledge of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, I could sort of lean back and really enjoy these animations most thoroughly.  While some may say ""Oh, these are just for kids,"" I truly wonder.  Yes, they are pitched for children, and yet, there's a not-too-obvious adult pitch, as well.  Anahoo, I still love this series and I'm glad I purchased it.  Yes, I do recommend it, but if you're an adult, keep the salt shaker handy.

5024333,5,B006WNSHZO,"The series is fantastic. The new original spin on the classic Sherlock Holmes tales told with technology and in a new time.

While I felt the way Sherlock ends up in the 22nd century stretches things a bit, however that is really my only complaint. The stories are great, the clues are actually laid out for you if you pay attention (at least the majority) so sometimes you can solve the case before Sherlock explains it.

All in all a great set to add to your collection.",1361145600,,472,4.413793103448276

5024336,5,B006WNSHZO,I have recently been reading some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books and when I ordered this and popped it into my DVD player I was excited and laughed a great deal at several small things they put in as well as he fresh story ideas. I loved this show and am sad that it wasn't a longer series.,1359936000,,293,3.983050847457627

5024339,4,B006WNSHZO,"Generally regarded as the world's most well-known literary sleuth, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes has been featured in films and on television many times.  In recent years, the character has been modernized in the British TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock/dp/B004132I20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock</a>, the 2012 CBS's series Elementary, and the feature films featuring Robert Downey Jr.  However the most advanced update of the character might be the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century (1999), which was produced by Scottish Television Enterprises.

The premise is that far in the future, Holmes is brought out of suspended animation, to resume his crime fighting career, assisting Inspector Beth Lestrade of New Scotland Yard.  Holmes is partnered with a police robot named ""Watson"", whose appearance is changed to resemble Holmes' old friend Dr. John Watson.  A total of 26 episodes were produced, each very loosely based on one of Conan Doyle's stories.  A descendant of Holmes' arch enemy Professor Moriarty, is featured as an ongoing adversary.

This program involves a pretty major makeover for the character, as targeted at a younger audience, Holmes is young, physically active, and doesn't investigate murder cases, play the violin, or use any illegal substances.  This Holmes is still quite confident and outspoken, and in accord with his motto ""eyes and brains"", relies heavily on observation, inference, and deduction, to solve his cases.  While he may not be completely at home with all the technical advances in the future, he is a fast learner, and adapts nicely to modern developments.  Another major factor, is the prominence of Beth Lestrade, who as a friendly rival of Holmes, is often is almost as important as the great detective.  Besides having Dr. Watson as a partner, Holmes sometimes works with some young junior detectives.

These ""modernized"" animated adventures are obviously a light years from Conan Doyle's original stories, but may be of some interest, in these times when there seems to be a renewed interest in Sherlock Holmes.  It is quite possible however, that some Holmes purists may find little to like about this series.

The animation is good, and minus most of the darker elements associated with Sherlock Holmes, the stories are mostly suitable for teens.  Definitely an acquired taste, Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century comes in a standard sized DVD case which houses three single sided DVD's in paper sleeves.  The set also includes ""bonus"" episodes of other cartoons, such as Stargate Infinity, and Flight Squad.",1357948800,,2655,5.486486486486487
5024340,5,B006WNSHZO,Got this for my brother a month ago or so. It's a retelling of several Sherlock Holmes stories in a futuristic setting. Before the title menu this dvd has advertisements for other classic cartoons that I had also forgot about. It was worth buying instead of paying shipping (super saver shipping ftw).,1357171200,,301,4.8076923076923075
5024341,5,B006WNSHZO,I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!,1356998400,,108,4.190476190476191
5024342,5,B006WNSHZO,"This is a good series if you remember it growing up, sometimes the cgi is very noticeable because it was created when the tech was first being used, but overall not bad. 5 stars for being as good as I remembered.",1356739200,,212,4.195121951219512
5024343,4,B006WNSHZO,"This show I believe got lost in the mix of more popular shows at the time. This show really appeals to me as an adult with it's more intellectual story lines. It's well written and put together. There is even a little oyu could learn and take with you from this show, albeit from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles original writings they have used of course.",1356566400,,347,4.3538461538461535
5024344,5,B006WNSHZO,This series is good because it make you to think like Sherlock Holmes and solving the case with him in the show.,1355184000,,112,4.136363636363637
5024345,3,B006WNSHZO,"I know that it may sound a bit rough as a fan of all things Sherlock Holmes, but I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with this adaptation all in all. Re-tellings are apart of all things (books, art, music, movies, tv programs) and sometimes they aren't fantastic. Not to say that this is terrible, but it wasn't my cup of tea. The accents that were giving to these characters were meant to sound British (different dialects also used) and they sounded rough and forced in some places. The character of Holmes himself IS egotistical, but sometimes he didn't feel like the character in this watered down version of himself. His over explaining EVERYTHING to the people around him as well as the enemy weren't fun and sometimes long to sit through. Though the actual Sherlock Holmes character does explain things, it is usually towards the end of the adventure when things are wrapping up and doesn't feel like it drags on. And the CONSTANT usage of ""It's Elementary"" followed by the lengthy explanations was rather off putting.

Now please keep in mind, I did like the series over all. Some funny, unique stories plus some humor occasionally added, that and a little bit of mystery for us as the viewer to follow made for a reasonably smooth ride. It is an overall basic cartoon series that is enjoyable to an extent.",1355011200,4,1319,4.660944206008583
5024346,4,B006WNSHZO,"This show has great charm, and brings Sherlock Holmes to an interesting, if not always *entirely* believable, future time of England.  I enjoy the characters and their interactions, seeing the cases present themselves and become solved, and the twists and turns within each episode.  Nothing new hat, but still well done.
However, I wouldn't recommend this show for everyone.  It can feel corny sometimes, and the animation is occasionally buggy or (specifically during the few CGI segments) somewhat repetitive.  While not a pain to watch, it can become slightly distracting while watching.  But for a Saturday morning cartoon on DVD, it's a pleasant watch and enjoyable in its own right.",1347840000,,689,5.2272727272727275
5024347,5,B006WNSHZO,It was even funnier than I remember it being when I was a kid. Plus I bought it when it was on sale so it was a double win for me! :) I give it two thumbs up.,1347494400,,158,3.1842105263157894
5024348,3,B006WNSHZO,"I remember originally watching this series because of the Sherlock Holmes angle. I must have liked it back then because I was happy to see that it was available on DVD.  As for now...it's still a better cartoon than others of that era, but the female character Lestrad is the stereotypical strident ""lone wolf"" cop in an outfit Barbie would love, with a stupid Captain in charge.  Her character was irritating, but after the first few episodes I did enjoy the stories more. It was fun to find out the voice of Sherlock Holmes was Lt Randy Disher! (Monk)

If you are forgiving of Lestrad, and chalk it up to 1990's imported programming, it's not a bad way to spend some Saturday mornings.

Also, the only extras are previews of some really, really awful cartoons from the same production company. Ugh.",1346112000,,800,4.652482269503546

5024357,3,B006WNSHZO,"I bought this as a blind buy and I must say I am really enjoying the show.  The storylines are well-crafted and the animation is great.  However, there appears to be a glitch on Disc #1 in the episode entitled ""The Scales of Justice"": at time interval 3:29 the disc freezes (and it's not a normal layer transition freeze) and then jumps immediately right into the middle of another scene with Holmes and crew fighting mythical creatures.  The timer on my DVD doesn't skip ahead and the total episode runs at 16:06 minutes rather than the normal 22 minutes, so obviously about 6 minutes of footage is missing.  I think it is an error how the disc was manufactured and I will be contacting Mill Creek Entertainment about the issue.  Anyone else experiencing this problem?

UPDATE 11/11/12:
Mill Creek recently send me a pressed replacement Disc #1 and the episode plays just fine now, so it appears that they have fixed glitch.

5024358,5,B006WNSHZO,"As a long term Holmsian I sometimes (well, usually) find myself in the minority when discussing this series with fellow fans, most of whom dismiss it as pure non-canonical rubish. I, however, quite enjoy it, and have ever since I first discovered it back in 2000 or so. To be honest, the stories stay far truer to charactor than most interpretations of Holmes, far more so than Basil R., for example. And it's the perfect way to introduce children to the great detective.
Each tale is based on one of A. Conan Doyle's original masterpieces (some, I must say, more than others) and names and referances from the classics abound.  If you have any love for Sherlock mysteries, go ahead and pick up a copy.  You can claim it's for the kids if you must, but you'll find yourself popping it in when they're not around.",1330646400,18,812,4.554794520547945
