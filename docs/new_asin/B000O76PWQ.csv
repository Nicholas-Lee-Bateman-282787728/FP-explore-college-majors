8183233,1,B000O76PWQ,"On their way to Crystal Lake a group of young adults spoofing young adults stop at Alfred Packer Lake. The next thing you know we have Troma style effects. The film was a spoof of woods slasher style films, but incorporated cannibal zombies. Two guys pretended to be French Canadians with bad accents and one guy wore an Afro wig stereotyping black people. Some might find it more insulting than amusing, especially French Canadians. The acting was terrible, some by design. Sound man (?) shadow in van scene, headlights randomly in forest, cliche dialogue including old MTV video dialogue a lot of younger people might not get.

Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.",1476316800,,660,4.892857142857143
8183234,3,B000O76PWQ,"Ahh Forest of the Dead, what can I say about this movie? Do me a favor and open your wallet right now. How much money is in there? It doesn't matter, whatever you have is more than the budget of this entire movie. I understand the constraints of the low budget horror movie, like you can't have real actors, so you use your friends. You can't afford a real camera, so you use a camcorder. And why build sets when you can just find a place and shoot. This movie sucks, and I liked it a lot. Why you ask? Because these people took all they had and just had fun with it. This movie had to of been shot over a long period of time because one of the actors had a beard and braces and then in another scene they disappeared. There were many things like this going on that were just so ridiculous you couldn't help but laugh. It's an Evil Dead like movie that is nowhere near as good, but still has some nice (sometimes obviously fake) gore and tons of laughs. It's nothing great, but it really wasn't meant to be. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and I am proud to put it in my collection. PROPER!",1208822400,3,1097,4.083333333333333
8183235,1,B000O76PWQ,"Never, ever watch this pitiful movie. Don't even watch it for free on cable. Beyond bad acting. Worse special effects than Sesame Street. One scene shows a puppet's head being ripped off with fake looking syrup. This was suppose to be a human person and the syrup was suppose to be blood.
A young looking guy with a beard plays an old man. He did not have one strand of grey in his beard or in his hair.

I rate this movie with one star. This is not eveil dead on acid. There is absolutely nothing in the world to compare this nonsense to.",1202774400,,539,4.1826923076923075
8183236,1,B000O76PWQ,"Duped again.  In search for some zombie fun I came across this title.  This was so awful.  I mean, pitiful.  If there was a budget it was 20.00 maximum.  I think it should be illegal to make movies this bad.  REALLY!  Unless you like camera work that makes you dizzy, people who cannot act, and a corny NOT scary plot, STAY AWAY from this ""movie.""",1201910400,,347,4.246153846153846
8183237,4,B000O76PWQ,"Since there are so few reviews about that movie, maybe you don't know what to expect from it. I tell you what to expect : a lot of bloody freaking fun !! If you can stand micro budget movie making that is. Some people are turned off by the lack of production values ? Too bad for them, they are definitely missing something here.
To me that flick has everything it needs : a forest, a camp, a lake, a bunch of demonic zombies and A LOT of gore ( I'm talking about entrails and body parts all over the place ). Plus it really is funny and even mannages to be sort of scary at times.
It has a basic effective EVIL DEAD like plot : some partying teens go to some cabin in the woods... some of them get possessed by the forest's  evil spirits and start to attack and eat their friends. It is well shot : the photography and angles beautifully exploit the landscape and the action. By the way, it moves fast, hand in hand with the top notch editing. That movie delivers the goods and then some and I think most gorehounds will agree. Don't pay attention to the fools who fast forward through the movies they review and hate( ain't that a shame ? ).
If you crave for laughs, gore and scares, if you love movies like DEMONS, EVIL DEAD or SAVAGE HARVEST and can stand no budget flicks ( I'm talking about video shooting and amateurish acting here ): then what the hell are you doing reading this review ? Just buy the damn thing !! Thanks to BRIAN SINGLETON and his friends for the crazy ride, I sure will keep an eye on these folks.",1196294400,,1525,4.169491525423729

This movie must've been made on the most miniscule of budgets. Read on:

THE ACTORS: So so. Nothing incredible here. Some held their own more than others. Some minimal nudity.

THE ZOMBIES: These are ""Snyder's Runners"" all the way. These zombies actively pursue their victims. The make up for the zombies pretty much was to darken around their eyes and then cover their faces with blood. Since this movie was set ""in the woods,"" lighting was minimal and the zombie's faces were barely visible at times (which I feel, actually helped make the zombies more frightening). Sadly, at times, zombies that I thought had been destroyed, pop up later to wreck havoc, which made me wonder, if that was an ""oops,"" or if it was the zombe that was destroyed earlier really wasn't.

THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: Wow. Where do I begin? From the latest bag of innards from the local meat market to the victim getting his PAPER MACHE head torn off, having no budget was blatently visible. Looks like it was filmed on whatever the next piece of equipment is up from a camcorder. On the plus side, NO heavy metal music soundtrack.

Overall, this movie is SO bad, that it's good. THIS is how cheap no budget movies should be done. This movie was SO awful, that I am recommending it! This is a must see cheesy zombie flick! The bloopers at the end re-enforce that all the indivuals involved had fun making this. There is really nothing here that hasn't been seen or done before, but because it is so terrible, you just have to see it! I am going to give this two ratings: one, as a rating for a zombie movie, and two, one for the campy, cheese factor.

Rating: As a zombie movie: 2 out of 5 stars
As a campy, cheesy ""B"" flick: 4 out of 5 stars",1193788800,2,1728,4.418238993710692
8183239,1,B000O76PWQ,"I should have known better....... But I'm a sucker for Zombie Movies. which this is not. Looks like a bunch guys video taped their camping trip, I'm sure it was shot in one day. pretty lame all around. The tag line on the cover said ""Classic Gorefest"" I only recall seeing one gore scence of a guy getting his head ripped off, which was very fake, but then again I was fast forwarding through most of it.",1192665600,,404,4.259740259740259
