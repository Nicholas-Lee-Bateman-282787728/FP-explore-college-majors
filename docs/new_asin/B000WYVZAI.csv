2993049,5,B000WYVZAI,I love the fast delivery and the fun choreography! Challenging but not difficult with a little practice! Amar is also one of my favorite belly dancers. She is amazing!,1286841600,,167,4.793103448275862
2993050,4,B000WYVZAI,"Amar is beautiful, the routines are well explained and executed, BUT this video is NOT for the beginner. Although the combinations may not be complex for one familiar with the basics, I won't be able to enjoy this DVD until I get a FIRM foundation in bellydance from another source.",1286150400,,282,4.66
2993051,3,B000WYVZAI,I was extremely pleased with the fast delivery!! 5 stars for that. Video quality was superb! Amar Gamal's belly dancing average but not as good as Sadie. Her instructions in the video was not detailed. Not for beginners.,1280880000,3,220,4.815789473684211
2993052,5,B000WYVZAI,"This is the only Amar Gamal DVD I've ever seen (I ordered it from it's description and Amazon ratings), and I am very well pleased.  This is a beautiful and accomplished dancer who shares her elegant techniques with her Sisters in the Dance.  A must for your library!",1261008000,,267,4.541666666666667
2993053,5,B000WYVZAI,"amar teaches clearly and moves with such grace.  i would recommend this video for someone with some background in this dance form, as the basics are assumed.  i am looking forward to buying any of her new dvd's as this one was pretty good",1228003200,4,238,4.386363636363637
2993054,4,B000WYVZAI,"I love the coh&eacute;graphie, most of the danse is very original. The only thing I don't like about this DVD is that there is no brake down on the technique. I love the shimmy of Amar, and I would like to have her technique.",1211673600,8,225,4.136363636363637
2993055,5,B000WYVZAI,"This is one of the best of all the videos I have, which count in the dozens.
Amar breaks down the steps and puts them together in a very clear way. She has many new moves that I have been able to incorporate into my own dances. She is a very talented dancer and choreographer.",1210377600,18,276,4.036363636363636
2993056,5,B000WYVZAI,"This is a advance dance. Her shimmies are what I'm working on. But more than that,the moves are with every beat, the music and flow are fast enough to keep my heart rate up. I will be waiting for the next dvd!!! LOVE THIS one. I have over 50 dvds this one will be a every day pick for a dancing workout!!",1208995200,22,304,3.9193548387096775
2993057,5,B000WYVZAI,"This is great to learn a belly dance choreography from.  The DVD gives to ways to learn the choreography, slow with a practice session and faster where it builds and builds.
Both are excellent ways to learn.

Thanks Amar Gamal!",1208563200,13,227,4.65

8226113,5,B000WYVZAI,"Once again, Amar knocks it out of the park!  I loved how she taught and did drills until your body incorporates it into its' muscle memory.
Thanks again.",1486252800,,153,4.464285714285714
8226114,4,B000WYVZAI,She is a very talented dancer and a clear instructor. I took lessons at her Belly Queen class and she is just as clear in this video as she is in her class. I use this video as a workout DVD for years already and it doesn't get old. The level of difficulty for this video would be beginners in my opinion. I have had friends who are absolute beginners follow along with the video and catch onto the movements quickly.,1454371200,,417,4.160493827160494
8226115,5,B000WYVZAI,excelente producto,1429228800,,18,8.5
8226116,5,B000WYVZAI,I am so proud to say I am being taught Bellydance By her..she is amazing!,1428105600,,73,3.933333333333333
8226117,5,B000WYVZAI,"Amar Gamal has to me one of my favourite dancers.  She has a lot of flexibility and grace from her ballet training.  There is a lot to learn from Gamals twists and turns and her shimmies are enviable.
The choreography in this DVD is not for beginnings and might set a challenge even for some advanced students.
The choreography section is broken down into combinations.  After going over a combination, she starts at the beginning of the dance again, adding each combination piece by piece.  My only criticism is that restarting the choreography from the beginning gets monotonous after a while but is not that different from how some classes are structured anyway.  By the end of the instruction you know the first combinations really reallly well!

She does two nice performances in costume at the end of the instruction.",1409616000,2,823,4.8428571428571425
8226118,5,B000WYVZAI,Amar Gamal is an amazing dancer!,1408924800,,32,4.5
8226119,5,B000WYVZAI,"These are super modern, fresh and sexy moves. It moves a bit fast for those less experienced dancers like myself, but overall, I'd still highly recommend it because the choreography is very sexy and fun. Her style is just gorgeous. AND, hallelujah, she takes the approach of repeating all previous sections learned with each new one, so it really reenforces the material, and helps you learn it well. (Her other DVD, Captivating Choreography, is missing that aspect, unfortunately). Great bellydance practice/workout.",1351123200,2,517,5.395061728395062
8226120,2,B000WYVZAI,This is not a dvd to help master the dance.  It is only this dancer's change-up of different moves.  Very disappointing. Don't know what the time frame is for returning it but I would like to return it. Don't waste your time buying this one.,1314748800,,241,4.333333333333333
8226121,5,B000WYVZAI,"When ever I'm choreographying a number and get creatively brain locked, this DVD is definitely one I pull off the shelf and it hasn't let me down yet.  Every time I watch it I see something different which also challenges me to learn a different step or combination that I can use in my performance. Thank you Amar Gamal!",1302912000,,321,4.440677966101695
8226122,5,B000WYVZAI,"I enjoyed following Amar's intructional DVD! As a belly dance student, it was educational and informative. I've always admired her style whenever I get to see her dance! The DVD gave me some insight on how she puts together a performance piece.",1296604800,,244,4.833333333333333
