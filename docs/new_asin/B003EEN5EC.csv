All the cast is great and the Andres Degas did a great job writing, directing - keeping the story flowing with all the performances and keeping the editing very smooth. Jason Raize is really a very talented actor and is wonderful in this role as Jamal. Jason, himself a magnificient singer, soley relies on his acting here and turns in a sensitive and memorable performance. The made for TV movie is just under an hour but it is one of the only film pieces that Jason got a chance to do before he sadly cut his life short. A big thank you to Degas Films for making this film available here on Amazon.com - and it comes with a bonus soundtrack CD too!",1296691200,,787,4.2885906040268456
