4486956,5,B004WJU46U,"This movie should be in Redbox, Blockbuster, Netflix, and all areas for movie viewing. Very interesting, hopeful, full of inspiration. Different and controversial according to science, but science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. According to HRM he is allowing science to study him so that science can get the proper findings on sun gazing. Still a lot to find out.
It's frustrating how hard it is to come upon this movie. Done back in 2010. I had to do actual searching to find it.
Interesting enough to me to start sun gazing withing one hour of sunrise and sunset. Starting slowly and working my way up in how long I gaze. Sometimes its cloudy so I get either one I can, but I like the morning sun the best. I shall see for myself.",1329436800,26,838,4.630872483221476

4486980,3,B004WJU46U,"Spoiler:

This is very strange. After I was almost convinced of benefits of sun gazing the main character went to check his eyes and now he has ""burned"" his eyes because of sun gazing?? What if he had this problem before starting sun gazing? What if his eyes problem where related to other factors such as blue light exposure or any other reason? If the movie wanted to convince people to sun gaze then they did wrong cause people will be scared and skeptical about the practice. HRM also doesn't show references of those ancients books he says he read about the sun gazing. I don't but to me there is a l",1423612800,2,605,4.353982300884955
4486981,3,B004WJU46U,"The documentary follows a die- hard believer, (one who hears of it and throws their whole being into it) as he attempts to justify the practice in himself and to others.
It really shows the trials and the upsets as one challenges their own notions against the backdrop of other people. Unfortunately, I think the director did that by accident.

The documentary shows:
-The range of people involved in the practice of Sungazing
-What each of them experiences from Sungazing
-The reasons why they Sungaze
(Spoiler: None agree)

The only common ground is that they each heard about Sungazing -and then tried it.

This documentary gives great examples of people who fast. The no-food people are simply fasting and thats normal in the world.",1420934400,5,736,4.919354838709677
4486982,1,B004WJU46U,"I am open minded, obviously, but this is the WORST documentary I have ever seen in my life. The narrator meanders, and I don't mean in a pleasant way. One of the subjects is teenage boy who thinks sungazing will ""make him better than other people"" and he ""won't need his parents anymore.""  This has become a running gag in my house. No science. No substance. No spirit.  No inspiration. Just no.",1420761600,10,395,4.472222222222222
4486983,1,B004WJU46U,There is actually a story here.  But the editing is so terrible that it gets lost.  It's also way too long.,1418083200,5,107,4.0476190476190474
4486984,2,B004WJU46U,"Ok I will just tell you this, (spoiler alert) the guy goes to the ophthalmologist and she tells him that he has burnt he's corneas and yet he still does it. I don't know why a few of these people say they are able to go long periods of time without eating, they look like they have eaten some groceries. I believe in sunning but for the whole body and not with your eyes open but what can i say, thats just one woman's opinion",1415491200,6,426,4.023529411764706

4487023,5,B004WJU46U,"Mr. Sorcher really gathered a lot of information, testimonials, and personal experiences throughout the course of this film. To be honest, I was expecting the film to be a little one sided, being ONLY FOR...all the benefits of Sun Gazing...but I was pleasantly  surprised; he attacked both sides of the phenomenon, leaving very few questions unanswered. The documentary was also filmed very professionally(sound/definition), there was nothing cheap or rushed about it!",1374019200,7,468,5.591549295774648
4487024,5,B004WJU46U,"This film follows the adventures of a man who is lured into a group that practices an activity called ""Sun Gazing"".
Sun gazing supposedly cures all emotional, mental, and health problems by simply gazing at the sun in daily, ever increasing,incremental periods of time building up to forty minutes upon which all of your problems will be solved. And supposedly one would never need to eat food again after that because the sun would provide all the nourishment one would ever need according to their leader, an Indian immigrant who goes by the name HRM. HRM claimed for years that he stopped eating for years due to the effects of sun gazing.

The film follows a man who damages his eyes performing this dangerous and foolish practice. And sadly
the film cynically uncovers the fact that the sun gazing cult leader known as HRM eats at an ALL YOU CAN EAT Indian BUFFET EVERY DAY of HIS LIFE!
Before you are inclined to follow this dangerous and deeply foolish practice, you should see this powerful documentary that proves that sun gazing is a highly dangerous practice.

It is sad to see his followers. They have such low self esteem that they would put themselves and others in jepardy to follow this cult con leader.
Worth a look!",1371427200,6,1233,4.67741935483871
4487025,5,B004WJU46U,"I purchased this DVD because I knew it was another part of the puzzle for those on a spiritual quest. I had heard about this technique in 1996 and wanted to know more about it. I was a bit fearful of looking directly at the sun but the article I had read and this DVD, Eat the Sun implied to look at the sun as it was setting or rising. I will definitely be doing what this film talks about in the warmer months to come, as I live in the Northeast and it's a bit cold to plant my bare feet on the ground. I highly recommend ""Eat the Sun""........David",1362268800,14,550,3.963963963963964

8445169,4,B004WJU46U,"The film is interesting just because it deals with people looking for spiritual awakening, weather you agree with it or not is not the issue, I find learning what makes people do what they do is interesting to me!  The editing was very well done for a subject I think would be hard to make cohesive, but then I am a little biased because I know one of the editors!",1475884800,,364,4.2

8445171,5,B004WJU46U,"In my late twenties I went through some mystical experiences after a few years of sitting on a daily basis in prolonged meditation practice. Part of the mystical experiences involved gazing at the sun for long periods of time. After a few months of this, the mystical episodes died down, and so did the sun gazing. Since that time I have seen a little here and there on sun gazing. This was the first documentary I have found to objectively examine the pros and cons of doing it. What interested me was that the pros and cons fit with my own experience. Pros. Pineal gland stimulation, heightened senses, greatly diminished desire for food, fasting made very easy, heightened energy. Cons. Over-sensitivity making it difficult to function in the world, increased sense of isolation leading me to stop. Other cons mentioned in this film included a sense of arrogance and feeling special. I did not have that one. The fact that the documentary confirmed my own experiences tells me that the experiences have a biological basis as well as a spiritual one. I appreciated how some of this was mentioned in regards to more than just the pineal gland activation. Yes, you can damage your eyes. Yes, it needs to be done with care. In my case I was in a state of mystical rapture when I did it.  To let you know my eyes suffered no damage at all. In the end the documentary is not saying which is the best way to go, to sun gaze or not to sun gaze. You are given the pros and cons. No hype as to it being overly good or bad. You decide what you want to take out of it. That is why I felt it was objective opening the door for more research from those who experience it, and those who study it's effects for better or worse.",1458259200,8,1714,4.389937106918239
