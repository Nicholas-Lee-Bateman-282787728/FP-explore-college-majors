8087855,5,B000BJS4QW,I saw this movie at the woodstock film festival and was blown away. It has got to be the most provocative film I've seen in a long time.  It's about time independent film makers started tackling the subjects hollywood won't touch. I hope these guys keep the faith and don't sell out to the system because they definitely have the talent and something to say. Awesome!,1132617600,2,367,4.5606060606060606
