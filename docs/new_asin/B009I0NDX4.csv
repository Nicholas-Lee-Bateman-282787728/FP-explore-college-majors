8541716,5,B009I0NDX4,"If more people (including Mitt Romney himself) had seen this, then Obama would have been rightfully denied his second term.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  The liberals out there will naturally point to this as some sort of ""far right propaganda"" but these are not only ordinary Americans, they're people (like me) largely DEMOCRATS who VOTED for Obama in 2008.  If a few million people would have realized that it's okay to dislike Obama and that doesn't make them racist, we'd have a much better country now.

So it's 2017, why bother watching it now?  Those who don't remember the past are doomed to repeat it. Much of the hold that liberal politics still has is the result clinging on to Obama's legacy.  The more this man can be discredited as the socialist charlitan that he was, the easier it will be to undo his disastrous policies and prevent them in the future.",1501459200,,868,4.677631578947368
8541717,5,B009I0NDX4,"Once again, we are finding out that there is NO HOPE and NO CHANGE....It would appear that many of those who voted for Obama are finally realizing that he was not the better choice even if the opposition was certainly not perfect.",1377907200,,230,4.5
8541718,5,B009I0NDX4,"Look in the future with this movie.
It makes me wonder how all of America be run by
less than 600 people.....and we let them do it.
Even pay them to do it.",1357171200,3,155,3.727272727272727
8541719,4,B009I0NDX4,"Excellent look at why those enticed by promises found that they were disillusioned.  Personal interviews with several who were ""hoodwinked"" and learned a great lesson.",1353628800,2,167,5.68
8541720,5,B009I0NDX4,this film had a 1 hour special done with Sean Hannity on fox news....it was the most powerful fox news segment of the campaign . Hannity special brought people that were in the film. This film explores why the middle class is being destroyed by the Obama economic program. Writer/Director Stephen K. Bannon has made a beautiful film and Citizens United again have a winner .,1353628800,2,374,4.681818181818182
8541721,1,B009I0NDX4,"I was looking forward to seeing a thought provoking documentary when I pressed play last night but instead found nothing but a hatchet job that amounted to little more than an hour long GOP commercial that plays loosely with the facts and really makes a weak case. For example, TARP was passed and signed into law by then President Bush in October 2008, but the film portrays the bank bailouts happening as a result of Obama taking office. The film is a series of segments showing Democrats and Independents who voted for Obama but are now sorry that they did. Ultimately, the remorseful voter premise falls short because of a lack of any other supporting material. There is absolutely nothing new here that you haven't heard already. This film doesn't even cover the normal GOP talking points well. This is not a documentary but an hour long PAC commercial that isn't done that well. Don't waste your time.",1351123200,5,907,4.746835443037975
8541722,4,B009I0NDX4,"For me this is a re-cap and nice reminder of how it all happened with Obama. I remember that time in my life. All my coworkers were excited and I didn't want to ruffle anyone feathers but I never understood then just as I am now of how he could do all that he was claiming....

There is no narrator which is nice. Just people who are independent and democrats speaking. I hope that part is really true. How much of it is scripted and there own words? I have no idea. Its all chopped and edited and the music has an effect. You really feel motivated after watching this.

It goes through the incredible campaign of Obama to the presidential office which was his greatest achievement and then events through out his presidency that has left him with the horrible record he has now. Quite frankly its fairly indefensible.

But for me, Obama has angered another group of people and that's the real movers and shakers of the world. The people who dictate and push policy all through out the world. People we rarely see in our media. This documentary doesn't cover that. I believe there are people the president has to answer too and this is why you see Obama now in a real dog fight in this election. They are no longer standing by his side.

This ambassadors death in Libya is not going away. Seeing Biden's reaction all but hollering that they didn't know in a recent debate with Ryan and seeing Susan Rice blame the CIA after she was pushing really bad info to the national media.

For me its one of two things, negligence which for the state department is not surprising. The State Dept has some know it all civilians there that don't respect military or security/hostile situations. You make the bed you sleep in. Which I can totally believe if that's the case.

OR it was a setup to make Obama look even more incompetent and unfortunately the Ambassador was sacrificed for that purpose. Given our history of CIA operatives ""Jackals"" its not outside the realm of possibility.

At any rate, Obama will not succeed in being re-elected.

He has insulted Great Britain and he has infuriated Israel. He has done none nothing to put people back to work. All we ever hear in the news is Obamacare and people like Sandra fluke talking about how government should pay for contraceptives....Gee should the government pay for atheletes foot cream as well? Take some personal responsibility you nasty woman. For crying out loud this woman has a degree in Law!!!

But the best line in this documentary and I saw it also in the Dinesh D'Souza Obama flick, Nancy Pelosi,""We have to Pass the Bill so that you can find out what is in it....""

This is why we need term limits in congress.",1350518400,10,2670,4.532224532224532
8541723,5,B009I0NDX4,"This documentary shows people who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and how their hopes have faded.  The people look like middle class voters and could be my neighbors.  They talk about budgeting for gas, food, and about the many things they cannot afford.  There are numerous clips from 2008, showing HUGE crowds of people showing up to catch the wave of the Obama ""aura"" and vote for this superhuman who would bring true hope and change.  They talk about how excited they were to be a part of the election and how electrifying it felt to vote for Obama.

The documentary is simply people telling their stories of shock and sense of ""how could this happen in America and to ME?""  I'd recommend this to anyone on the fence about the upcoming presidential election.  I saw from the video how easy it was for people to think Obama was an answer to their problems, and I sympathize with their sense of being betrayed or abandoned by someone who promised so much.  I also have empathy for lifelong Democrats who have a hard time separating themselves from this man who was supposed to represent their best interests.

I appreciate the way this movie opened my eyes and helped me sympathize with others.  I would gladly share it with anyone on the fence.  (If you can't pass it on you can always resell it on here.)  It definitely helps a person see that ""it's not just me"" and that many others all over the USA are struggling too.  We are the 99%.",1350518400,7,1440,4.471264367816092
8541724,5,B009I0NDX4,"This film was refreshing. Instead of the usual republican talking heads, the cast is made up of all democrats and independents.  I, too, voted for Obama in 2008. I will be casting my ballot for Mitt Romney this cycle.  Not because I'm a super Mitt fan, but because I don't think this country can take another four years of Obama. I don't trust him and he has not delivered ""hope and change"". Perhaps people will start listening!! I'm hopeful that others out there feeling buyer's remorse will realize they CAN help make a change.  A must watch for folks on both sides of the aisle.",1349222400,16,581,4.514285714285714
8541725,5,B009I0NDX4,"I liked how they used a bunch of former Obama voters in the movie.  Part of me hated these morons for not doing 5 minutes of research the first time, but I'll forgive them if this movie can make a difference. Buy this one and give it to your brain dead liberal friends.  We can't let America fall to the commies.",1349222400,12,312,4.098360655737705
