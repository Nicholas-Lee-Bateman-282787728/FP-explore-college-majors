I think this is a excellent concert. The Loreley concert has more spirited music but this one has better visuals. The guitar player is more on keyboards in this flick than guitar, which I think is a waste of his talents. Linda Spa does some really soulful wind instruments, and if Iris pounding those drums does not get you going, well give it up. The theme of this concert is space, so you get the more spacey music and lots of light show space Visuals on a very big screen behind them. I think this one has the best visuals of the 5 TD DVDs I have. This one is from 2007. The more recent ones (2008-2009) give the guitar player more of a lead role & I like that. I still have Epsilon Journey coming on a slow boat from Germany so it will be interesting to see something even more recent.",1355788800,,1395,5.340909090909091
8443783,4,B004VQC0I4,"I have been a tremendous fan of TD since the 80's and am very happy with this purchase with some caveats. As the other reviewer noted, this disc did not play on the Sony player that he owns. It does not work on my Sony player either (a BDP S5000ES) but the disc can played on my other BD player, an OPPO 93. I also own this same BR title in standard DVD (PAL) format and the picture on this BR is superior in every way. I have zero regrets on purchasing this disc and am really looking forward to receiving the other TD concert on BR that I ordered (The London Eye concert which in my view has a better choice of songs than One Night in Space, I know this because I already own the standard PAL DVD). The menu structure on the ONIS BR is a little awkward and cannot be pulled up while in play mode, but that is something I can live with. Regarding the audio: While it is quite good, we only get a form of Dolby surround (2.0 matrix) instead of DD or DTS that you would normally get from a stateside BR, despite what the packaging states. In summary I would say that the only reason I gave this BR a four star rating instead of five would be the fact that it is PAL, the sound could be improved somewhat and the song selection menu cannot be pulled up as an overlay when watching the disc. As for non-TD fans, you need not apply!

Ironically, the TD main website lists this BR as an all region title which clearly it is not (though I must add that as far as the picture goes, my OPPO plays the BD PAL with nary a glitch as opposed to the stutter I sometimes get with the standard PAL DVD). Oh by the way, owning an Anthem Statement D2v processor doesn't hurt! (it is so choice, and if you have the means I highly recommend picking one up! Ferris... :)

I am hoping that the next time TD is filmed, a BR comes out of the performance with all of the proper bells n whistles and fully compatible with NTSC.",1324684800,5,1902,4.069333333333334
8443784,2,B004VQC0I4,"The Amazon description lists this as an NTSC Region 1 DVD so I was surprised that my Sony DVP-NS315 DVD player refused to play it and instead displayed ""Playback prohibited due to location limitations"".  According to my PC's DVD playback software the DVD I received is a Region 1-6 (not Region 1) PAL (not NTSC) DVD.

The portion of the show that I watched on my PC looked promising, but a concert of this sort really needs to be experienced through better equipment than my PC can offer, so the DVD is going back to Amazon.",1249948800,7,524,4.447916666666667
