8008241,3,B00018WMT8,"BRENTWOOD 10 Movie Packs offer a variety of cinematic genres at bargain prices. Video transfers of their ""B"" movies are pretty decent, as is sound. The manufacturer's hinged boxes house DVDs adequately, but be careful the hinged sections don't pull away from the main spine! They're not that easy to reassemble.

The genre name 'B' movies was created for films such as these vintage horror cheapies from the 1930s through '60s. They don't make 'em like this anymore-- and that may be a good thing.

SYNOPSES for DEAD WALK:

""The Ape"" - Two stories in one. A scientist tries curing a young lady's polio with human spinal fluid even as a circus ape escapes and terrorizes the town. Cheapy ape costume.

""Atom Age Vampire"" - A stripper's face is disfigured in a car wreck. She's temporarily cured by a scientist who falls in love with her. He must kill young women to supply the girl with the fresh glands that keep her looking beautiful. A modern story with a gothic look to it.

""Bloody Pit Of Horror"" - Beefcake muscleman (and Jayne Mansfield's ex-hubby) Hargitay stars in this spaghetti-frighter about a cheesecake photographer and a bevy of babes doing a shoot at a creepy old castle inhabited by an axe-wielding maniac who wants to ""cut the cake.""

""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" - This little gem best illustrates the song ""I Ain't Got Nobody."" A surgeon's girlfriend is decapitated in a car wreck and he keeps her head alive in a pan while searching for a suitable body donor. (Think Sarah Jessica Parker in MARS ATTACKS!)

""Bride Of The Gorilla"" - Above-average cast in a sub-par story of a recently-married plantation owner transformed by voodoo into a sweaty guy in a cheap gorilla costume.

""Dead Men Walk"" - Twin brother tale. The good doctor kills his evil twin who returns as a vampire set on revenge. Nicely atmospheric story is better than one would expect. Outstanding performance by Frye as vampire's assistant.

""King Of The Zombies"" - This horror/comedy was directed by Jean Yarbrough, who also worked with Abbott & Costello. A plane crashes on an island and its passengers take refuge in a mansion inhabited by a doctor and his zombies.

""Revolt Of The Zombies"" - An international expedition is sent into Cambodia to destroy an ancient formula that turns men into zombies. Features stock footage of Bela Lugosi's eyes. A real stinker.

""The Screaming Skull"" - Golddigging newlywed husband tries to drive his wealthy wife insane by leaving a small skull in places where she will find it. It's just silly.

""The She-Beast"" - A woman drives into a lake and drowns. Her body becomes possessed by the spirit of a vengeful 18th Century witch. A waterlogged concept.

8008242,5,B00018WMT8,"ok,i'm a big fan of the bcieclipise 10 pack movies. i own quite a few of them and most are good. this pack even if the cover is not kid friendly and is gross, is very good and kid friendly. the movies are 30's thru 60's zombie movies and some are good. now some are so old they creak as you watch them but they do keep you entertained and that is the reason to buy them. as always if great transfers are what you want stay away, the rest of you may find a few gems in the collection",1145232000,2,482,3.83
