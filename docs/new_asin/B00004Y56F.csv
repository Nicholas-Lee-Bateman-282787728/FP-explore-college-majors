1370699,4,B00004Y56F,"Well, as an X-Men fan, I can honestly reccomend this to all others like me. This is an amzing Saga. The X-Men cartoons are quite possibly the  finest Marvel-based cartoons available. I certainly hope more will be  converted to DVD. Of course, I've only seen it on Video so far (today is  8/19/00!). I strongly urge you to buy this. It'll really get you into the  X-Men, if the film hasn't already!",966643200,,397,4.472222222222222
1370700,5,B00004Y56F,I have the 80s X-MEN on VHS. I bought this tape back in 1992 from a music store in the mall. Its Pryde Of The X-men when Kitty frist join the x-men. I can't find nothing on the internet about the x-men carttoon from the 80's.,1129939200,3,225,3.9130434782608696
1370701,5,B00004Y56F,"This was an exciting and great show. It featured good story lines, great character development, and good animation. This show is definitely better than a movie because it takes time to tell us a good story. Also it was quite faithful to comics.",1127520000,2,244,4.6976744186046515
1370702,5,B00004Y56F,"I've watched the saga a decade ago when they were aired regularly on tv and my reaction is still the same.awesome! i wish they will release all those episodes in order of there telecast.i want the dark phoenix saga to be on the market right now.a must for all Marvel fans. The Phoenix storyline is one of the best storylines ever produced by Marvel Comics,it got my jaw hanging from the first to the last episode.",1126396800,2,413,4.447368421052632

While these X-Men cartoons are not known for their outstanding animation, I can whole-heartedly recommend them for their storytelling alone.

The animation is acceptable - standard Saturday morning cartoons (not cgi, but animation).

If you've not seen the X-Men cartoons featured here, we are presented with this main group as the X-Men Team: Cyclops, Jean Grey, Gambit, The Beast, Wolverine, Julibee and Storm. And, of course, Professor X leads them. Rogue is around, but not in the first couple of episodes.

These combined episodes make a wonderfully told story. The characters are very faithful to their comic book counterparts, and have a depth that a lot of other cartoon characters lack. Be that praise for the comics or these episodes, matters not.

The DVD comes with few features. You're given the option of viewing all episodes or each episode individually. Please note - there are no chapters within each episode.

The sound quality was good and the voice-actors are effective.

It's the writing though, that lifts this series. It's a great story.

I recommend this DVD for the comic or cartoon fan. You won't be disappointed.

1370704,4,B00004Y56F,"Im glad they are starting to release DVD versions of Xmen. One problem though, why havnt they just released the seasons rather then just episodes here and there. Ive been a fan of the xmen for quite a while now.. to figure out that they should have entire seasons on dvd. Anyways if u never seen the original xmen series get this dvd. Its really cool.",1071619200,12,351,4.333333333333333
1370705,5,B00004Y56F,"my obsession with the xmen came about in junior high and has not stopped yet.  the animated series is my favorite cartoon ever, and the fact there are some episodes out on dvd makes me very happy.  i was not even aware that there were some dvds available until i did a random search.  i think i am lucky though cause now they all say out of stock.  back to the dvd.  the phoenix saga is one of the best story arcs they did on the cartoon.  my favorite thing in the world is to see the mutants use their powers and in this five episode dvd you really get to see mutants at their best.  it would even be better if they put the dark phoenix saga out as well to finish the story.  but since this is the only one out right now it will have to do, but i cant complain.  i suggest getting this dvd if possible b/c it really is worth the money.  any x-men buff should have this dvd or try to get it because it is part of x-men history and is a very important part of the x-men's evolution.  ----and to any one who cares please put out more of this cartoon out on dvd, there is still an audience for it and there are a whole lot of us who grew up while the cartoon was on----  so i highly recommend this dvd and will hope and pray that more will follow it in the future.",1055203200,3,1261,3.9019607843137254
1370706,5,B00004Y56F,"At least on Dvd.
This Dvd includes 5 episodes of the Phoenix Project shown in 1994.
Jean Grey converts onto Phoenix to save the galaxy from the evil emperor D'Ken who wants the M'Kraan crystal to control the galaxy and have their own world.
Lilandra the sister of D'Ken have taken the crystal with her and needs the help of the X men to defeat D'Ken evil plans.
Fun and entertaining. More episodes are on Vhs I hope they transfer soon to Dvd.",1021593600,7,442,4.337349397590361
1370707,4,B00004Y56F,"The 1st thing you notice is that the transfer is beautiful. The colors are intense and the images are crisp. I saw this originally when broadcasted on TV and it doesn't come close.
The story is a bit long winded but it is nice to see Jean Gray doing something for a change.
The animation style is not as sleek as the stuff you see on TV today but I like the attitude of the characters better than the current Xmen generation.  There was so much more drama in the older series.",1009497600,3,476,4.173913043478261
1370708,4,B00004Y56F,"I enjoyed this DVD release, but I wanted to see this saga in a movie format.  The DVD is divided into episodes, which drew my attentions slightly away from the action.  Because of the format, I am giving X-men the animated series 4 stars.",998524800,2,238,4.386363636363637

1370710,5,B00004Y56F,I watched the complete serie a long time ago and I completelly felt in love with it. It was so cool to see so many mutants with aweson costumes and fantastic powers. Although the serie is kind of old and the animetion is of low quality compared to the new version now on WB.But the creators made an excelent job by putting several characters from the comic book in the serie. The plot was very interesting too. From the complete serie the one that impressed me the most got to be the Phoenix saga. This part of the serie has everything it takes to make it excelent. They forgot to put many important details from the comic book in this saga but it didn't affected the story at all. I recomend this video to people who really like the x-men and comics. It is an excelent option for people who hadn't read all the comic books.,991872000,2,824,4.288461538461538
1370711,5,B00004Y56F,"This DVD of the old, but extremely awsome, X-Men Animated Series is long over due but is finally arriving. DVD is the best for of entertainment and the best way to capture a favorite movie forever but unlike VHS video tapes which can be unpredictable, these will last forever. The Pheonix Saga is an awsome series and definetly the peak of the show. If you loved the X-Men Animated show when it was on TV then you absolutly have to get this. The best feature is that it comes with 5 episodes all on the one DVD! More like this are on their way and we can not wait to watch and have great memories of the greatest American Made cartoon show ever finally returns to our hearts. BUY THIS! IT RULES! TRUST ME!",987724800,,705,4.268656716417911
1370712,5,B00004Y56F,"Being a huge X-Men fan, I love nearly all of the cartoons, but the Phoenix Saga is by far my favourite. I can't help thinking that the reason they chose Jean Grey to be the main character of this series, is because before she was very much what I like to call a ""nothing"" character, with her mutant ability rarely being of use, and whenever she did use it, she would collapse into the arms of Cyclops afterwards. She didn't even have a cute little code name like the rest of the X-Men! This series greatly improved her, though it ended rather tradgically. The romantic scenes between Jean and Cyclops only helped to carry the story line, and were even assisted by one romance scene between Gambit and Rogue. The story line was excellent, though I believe that the parts between the Empress of the Shi'ar and Proffesor Xavier dragged a bit... I loved this, and would definataely recommend it.",980035200,3,891,4.575
1370713,5,B00004Y56F,"The Dark Phoenix does't suffer in the translation of the Clarmont/Byrne story back in the late 70's.  A few changes to make it family friendly. However, the story still stands the test of time.  The trail of the Phoenix was still as tragic as it was all those years ago.  Lets hope Marvel releases the complete X-Men series on DVD. This one was the best of the bunch.",978134400,4,367,4.367647058823529
1370714,5,B00004Y56F,"""The Phoenix Saga"" is the first DVD of the animated series...and what a great choice they've made!  This DVD is a collection of the five-part series which tells the tragic story of the legendary Phoenix saving the universe from the evil Shi'ar emperor D'Ken.  Unfortunately, the X-Men member Jean Grey is the Phoenix's host, which causes confusion among everyone, including her.  In addition to this, Charles Xavier (Professor X) is psychically linked to D'Ken's sister, Llandra, bringing the battle to the planet earth.  All this results into a war against good and evil that may cost the life of one of the X-Men.  All that being said, the DVD looks great, of course.  Since this was produced before Dolby Digital was commonplace, it is presented in two channel mode (stereo), but it does ok for Dolby Pro-Logic mode.  The animation is a bit choppy in some places, but considering how fast they have to pump out cartoons, it's forgivable.  One noticable difference is the changing of the voice-overs for some of the characters.  The original cast seems to be intact, but the most obvious was that of Gladiator, the Defender of the Shi'ar throne.  For those with copies of the original series on VHS, listen to the difference and you'll see what I mean.  Otherwise, this is a must-have for the fans of the original animated series.  Now if they'll only release, ""The Dark Phoenix Saga""......",975888000,14,1392,4.851694915254237
1370715,5,B00004Y56F,"This DVD is packed full of X-Men goodness.  I definitely reccomend it to anyone who like the X-Men Movie or comics.  The picture looks great, it has DTS capabilities, and the cartoon is just really cool overall.  This is an awesome experience.  I was in awe as I watched the Blackbird soaring through space on the screen in perfect picture quality as it jumped from back left to right to front to center to front right speakers.  Brilliant.  The Phoenix costume also is very nicely done.  5 stars.  Be sure to pick this up along with the Movie and some of the figures which are also VERY cool.",975110400,,593,4.425925925925926
1370716,4,B00004Y56F,"I don't know why Universal had sudden released the DVD disc of X-men animated series: The Phoenix Saga. If the released is relied to the live X-men moive, it seems that Fox would be much more reasonable to get the rights of released.
Anyway, as a X-fan, you should known that ""The Phoenix Saga"" is a most important storyline in X-universe. Although the animated version may be quite different with comics (It seems that Madelyne Pryor would not appeared, because Jean Grey will return very soon); however if you don't hate the animated series, the disc is much worth to collect.
At present, there is still no sign to telling us that there would be more released of X-men animated series on DVD. I wish ""The Phoenix Saga"" would not be the only disc in the market. I'm glad to see more major storyline could be released, for instance: return of Jean Grey and ""Days of future past"".
Finally, I'm pleased the subtitles feature is available on the disc. The feature has really a helping tool for non-english viewer to understand the contents. If you have got DVD of ""Transformer: the Movie"" and ""G.I.Joe: the Movie"", you should known what I mean.",974592000,2,1141,4.653465346534653
1370717,5,B00004Y56F,"[Some] will have some bones to pick with the animated version of ""The Phoenix Saga,"" since it isn't the same as the comic book version. Naturally it's been sanitized and simplified (?) for younger children. But the animation is stupendous, the plotting very well done, and the voices, music and emotional impact are superb. From the simpler explanation of Jean Grey's necessary sacrifice to the beautiful rendition of Phoenix's costume and powers and the difference it makes in Jean, from the galactic battle to the ... ending, this interpretation of the X-Men's most heartwrenching storylines is definitely worth your time.",971222400,5,624,5.25

I loved both pheonix sagas, so it is still good.  I can't  wait for this dvd.  Hopefully it will have some cool extra features.",967507200,4,284,4.450980392156863

7926521,5,B00004Y56F,"That's the quote The Beast used from Ralph Waldorf Hemerson at the end of this piece that describes it beautifully. The X-Men animated series as a whole was a great achievement in animation and storytelling. While some fussed about certain characters not being on the main team, I think (looking back) they couldn't have pick better characters to be the main X-Men (though I wished Bishop could've been a full time character but oh well).

Back to this piece, it is the adaptation of the legendary Phoenix series that took place in the comics that really launched the Jean Grey character in Marvel history. A good side story is the short romance between Ilyandra and Professor Charles Xavier along with appearances from Juggernaut and the first appearances of both Black Tom and his heroic brother The Banchee. Of course, this also shows those aliens from the Shi'ar.

While it doesn't follow the comics exactly (some of the characters here such as Rogue, Gambit and Jubilee weren't even created when the original series came out in the late 70's-early 80's), it kept the same spirit of the original stories nonetheless. If you can find it for under $30, I would recommend this piece until one day someone gets some sense and release the series! I was in college when this came out and I still catch it when someone reruns it!

Anyway, a great piece of animated history to collect!",1222041600,,1381,4.7698744769874475

To make this short and sweet, I just wanted to voice my UTTER FRUSTRATION THAT THESE HAVEN'T YET BEEN RELEASED IN A COLLECTION SERIES!! All of em' in one purchase. Not just one disk for $20 bucks and 3 episodes.

7926526,5,B00004Y56F,"X-men the Animated Series, overall, and this storyline, The Phoenix Saga, in particular, is magnificent!  But why are they teasing us?  Why won't they (whoever they are) simply put out the entire X-men Animated Series box set?  The recent success of the live action X-men movies should prompt the powers that be into doing just that.

A scattered sale of X-men Animated Series episodes here and there is a bitter sweet happening indeed.  This series and this particular DVD, The Phoenix Saga, is nothing short of magnificent...and this opinion is coming from an over 50 true blue X-men fan who has the entire X-men comic collection from number one on.

Any X-men purist, like me, will enjoy the X-men Animated Series, especially The Phoenix Saga.  Unlike all other X-men interpretations, including the movies with its disappointing version of the Phoenix Saga, and the kiddy-level joke called X-men Evolution....the X-men Animated Series from the early 90s is about 90% true to the actual story lines from the comics, and about 99% true to the characters. (The most glaring fault is the ridiculous misrepresentation of the Angel, who, in the comics, anyway, LOVED his wings...who wouldn't?)

And the art, although inconsistent, approaches Disney at its best.

Rest assured, however, the Phoenix Saga art is among the top animation of the series, along with the Dark Phoenix Saga.  Simply beautiful animation, and MUST SEE material if you are anything close to being an X-men fan.",1149120000,6,1479,5.074380165289257
