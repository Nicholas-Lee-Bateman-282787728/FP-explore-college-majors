8043189,5,B0006U3SYO,"Contrary to what the previous reviewer wrote, this is a wonderful show that explores real teen issues. Yes, because this was done in the 80's, it may seem dated to some now, but this Canadian series tackled topics that are still seldom touched on by mainstream U.S. networks such as teen pregnancy, suicide, abortion, and AIDS among teens, just to name a few. I would highly recommend this exceptional show.",1180396800,,407,4.828571428571428
