8093469,1,B000BWDEA0,"I bought this for about 5 bucks and can honestly say I regret it. I was expecting to get a good background on the players featured on the dvd, with footage of major milestones, interviews,etc. I was disappointed to see the poor film quality of andre agassi and others as they hit shots in low key tennis events. No grand slam footage or even matches with any quality opponents were showed. The segments on each player are about 5 minutes long and some of the footage was repeated four or more times during the 5 minutes. This dvd is lame to say the least, and very cheaply made. Save your money.",1134864000,5,595,4.36936936936937
