8367924,2,B001LIK8D4,"Boring and disappointing work from shlockmeister Sergio Martino. Nothing much happens on the screen. Giallo specialist writer Ernesto GASTALDI was really tired this time. Elvire Audray is pretty but a terrible actress. Nice to see former sexy star of the Italian adventure/action movies of the 60's Wandisa GUIDA but unfortunately she isn't doing much.

Anyhow, this French/Italian co production tells the incredibly unengaging tale of some drugs hidden in some ancient burial tomb thing and some other stuff happens and there may or may not be supernatural forces at work.

Alan Hale jr-look-a-like Van Johnson gives long expositional scenes, and John Saxon gets his head twisted backwards (and apparently the killer also switched his right and left hands). Another victim looks like a cross between Michael Caine and Elmer Fishpaw from ""Polyester"". The music by Fabio Frizzi is just the score from ""Gates of Hell"" used again. The special effects are just maggots- maggots on photos, maggots on hands, maggots on statues.

Anyway, it should go without saying, but don't watch this movie.",1386201600,,1088,5.277456647398844
8367925,4,B001LIK8D4,"Whenever you approach an Italian genre film from the golden age of Euro exploitation and see a script written by Ernesto Gastaldi and Dardano Sacchetti, you know you'll be in for a roller coaster ride of twists and turns.  This film 'SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS' aka 'ASSASSINIO Al CIMITERO ETRUSCO' is just that one.  Directed by the great Sergio Martino after his excursions in Giallo territory with the beautiful Edwige Fenech, 'SCORPION' is a mixture of action with horror elements as a lot of the Italian films at that time seemed to blend genres within their structured contexts.  Don't be deceived by the cover art, it's a combination of drug smuggling, reincarnation, and Giallo elements all pieced together by the writers to deceive the audience till the finale.  The photography by Giancarlo Ferrando trancends the cheap looking sets and the music by Fabio Frizzi gives it a Goblinesque feel to it.  Unfortunately , our leading lady played by Elvire Audray is over the top and cameos by John Saxon, Marilu Tolo and Hollywood stalwart Van Johnson are wasted and just added to keep the red herrings going.  For the routine film enthusiast, it may seem like lame proceedings but if you are a fan of Eighties Euro Horror, by all means click the add to cart button.  It may not be a highlight in Sergio Martino's career but it sets up the great guilty pleasures to come as he pursued jungle and other types of action films later on.  Mya Communication delivers a nice widescreen transfer, alternate credits and deleted scenes archived from a television print never before seen and a nice poster gallery showing the advertising deceptions.  Great fun for die hard Euro fans.",1295913600,,1674,4.84561403508772
8367926,3,B001LIK8D4,"Sergio Martino made some of the best giallos (crime mystery movies) from the genres golden age 1965-1977. (some say 1970-77) although straight horror was replacing the genre as Italys most popular type of film by 1977. This movie which was made for tv and then re-edited for a release as feature film is a not a straight giallo. It is a hybrid of supernatural elements concerning the ancient etruscans and reincarnation among other elements.  Mixed into the stew are drugs and the hunt for treasure. So this is not anywhere near the quality of the giallos from the earlier days.  It does have good acting though from the excellent John Saxon and the late Van Johnson who was a major hollywood leading man back in the 1940's-50's.  This isn't filled with nudity or extreme violence like many giallos are and if you know that you can apprieciate this flick for it's own merit as a tamer giallo/horror movie.  After all many giallos are not that bloody , they just have lots of murders. This one has a killer who twists the heads of his victims or hangs them. And the twisting of heads would still keep this off non-cable American television channels even though this was made in 1982.  The horror elements are strong in this flick making it similiar to films like 1972's Hammer Horror film ""Blood from the Mummys Tomb"".  As the reincarnated lead character calls on the Etruscan gods to smite the defilers of the crypt.  I must admit I was hoping for a spooky giallo like the great 'The Etruscan Kills Again"" that movie cries out for a proper region one release and maybe mya will grab it as it's been remastered on the Bryan Edgar Wallace box set 3 from Germany. (it has no english subtitles though);  but instead the horror elements and drug smuggling overwash the whole production.  The lead actress is not a terrible one either because I have seen her in other films and she does a good enough job here.  Mya which has taken over from the great late No Shame films should be thanked for releasing these rare titles on dvd. I hope they go for more classic giallos in the future though. And this ones print could  have used some cleaning. but it was not too bad at all really. MYA doesn't have a website so we can't suggest films like 'the killer reserved nine seats"" , ""the etruscan kills again"" 'giallo de venezia"", 'death laid an egg"", 'the killer wore black gloves"" and the many other unreleased giallos out there. As for this one it came in the Italian horror craze of 1979-89 or so and that's why it's a mixture movie.",1245283200,5,2523,4.535242290748899

8367928,1,B001LIK8D4,"Avoid at all costs! This was a made for TV film so if you are looking for the usual amount of sex, violence, and good storyline this is not the film for you ( there isn't any blood in the entire production). Don't be duped into thinking this is another Curse of the Scorpions Tail or Strip Nude For Your Killer (which is how they are marketing this one), it is most definitely not. Even the presence of John Saxon can't save this awful production. Stay away! Get The French Sex Murders instead, it is much more fun!",1240963200,11,515,4.26530612244898
