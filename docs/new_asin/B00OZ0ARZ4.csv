6777261,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,"If you are a fan of the series Person of Interest, then you should become an owner of this DVD - talk about entertaining - wonderful. The cast are all on stage being interviewed by someone who has obviously watched the series and who could bring out the best in the cast. Hugely enjoyable, but then again I could be biased - I think the series is wonderful. A good buy as far as I am concerned.",1425859200,21,394,4.12987012987013
6777262,3,B00OZ0ARZ4,While I love the show and the Paley Center Panels these split panels (<30 min each) never seem to really get going so you might be a little disappointed by the panels themselves. I preferred the second one with the expanded cast.,1425081600,,229,4.476190476190476
6777263,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,I am a happy camper!!! BOTH events were on the DVD!!! I was concerned that the New York Event would be missing but it wasn't. LOVED these!!! Person of Interest is my favorite show! These are a MUST SEE!!!!,1424304000,8,205,4.282051282051282
6777264,1,B00OZ0ARZ4,"I bought this a few months ago, but just watched for the first time today. Like others, mine only had ONE event. How is this going to be corrected? I'm disappointed.",1423094400,5,165,4.354838709677419
6777265,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,We totally enjoyed watching this video.  It was nice to see them all with an incite to the reality of the show and their real personalities.,1419638400,2,140,4.384615384615385
6777266,1,B00OZ0ARZ4,"Disc contained 2 plays of the May 1, 2012 panel and not the Oct. 3, 2013 panel that it is advertised as having.  I'd really like to get this with the correct, advertised content but it keeps showing now as 'out of stock'.  Any info on when this will be corrected/back in stock?",1417305600,7,277,4.2075471698113205
6777267,4,B00OZ0ARZ4,"Love this, would give it 5 stars but my disc only has the LA event and missing the NYC event. I know its made to order so something must have gone wrong in the burn process.",1417132800,9,173,3.8333333333333335

6777275,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,"This is a review of the entire POI Series through Season 4 to date.

POI is one of the smartest, best-conceived shows on TV. I highly recommend watching all 4 seasons at least once, and look forward to the fifth.

The back story, multiple plot lines and multiple inquiries intellectually, morally, scientifically, and from multiple National Security perspectives is truly amazing and impressive.",1454025600,5,395,5.253968253968254
6777276,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,"LOVE this show. I missed most of the last 2 seasons, so I purchased the series. SO GLAD I DID!!!  Now, I just hope they don't actually cancel the series!",1454025600,,153,4.1

6777281,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,"Best show on TV.  Great characters & relationships.  Wonderful backstories.  Make you care about these characters.  Well written, well acted.  Great story telling. Very current in world events.  Everyone I have recommended this show to has loved it.  Been a fan sine it first aired Sept 2011.  Best looking & most talented cast on TV:  Jim Caviezel, Michael Emerson, Taraji P Henson, Kevin Chapman, Amy Acker & Sarah Shahi.",1447632000,10,423,5.0144927536231885

6777284,3,B00OZ0ARZ4,"Yeah, only came with the 2012 event. I was lucky I got it so cheap, otherwise I'd have been much more disappointed.",1433376000,,115,4.2727272727272725
6777285,4,B00OZ0ARZ4,"Only included the LA taping, but was still worth the money 'cause I bought it used.  If you are a fan of the show or just Jim or Michael, you'll love their candidness.",1430697600,,167,4.0606060606060606

8685618,1,B00OZ0ARZ4,Dvd was fine didn't appreciate where it was delivered thrown in Bush at end of driveway,1526342400,,87,4.5
8685619,3,B00OZ0ARZ4,"I was disappointed with this. I bought it, which is something I rarely do, and especially since the interview with the cast of POI at Comic Con was free. I love POI, but this interview with the cast yielded nothing not already generally known. Johnathan Nolan and Michael Emerson do most of the talking. The ladies get to say little; and everything everyone says sounds rehearsed because they have said them many times before. As with Comic Con, Jim Caviezel always seem at a loss for words when asked to respond to any statement or question. I understand why his character is one of little words and mostly action (Sarah Shahi too). Amy Acker is my favorite but she did not get to say much although her character really carried the premise of the show especially in the later seasons. (Imagine my surprise when she showed up in an episode of Grimm!). All in all, the cast of POI should stick to acting, forget the interviews. They are not good at that.",1484697600,,953,4.546511627906977
8685620,4,B00OZ0ARZ4,I enjoyed learning a little bit more about the stars who play the characters in the show and something about how the show came together.,1481760000,,136,4.48
8685621,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,Thoroughly enjoyed it.,1475020800,,22,6.666666666666667
8685622,4,B00OZ0ARZ4,"A little too much time with an enjoyable set of actors.  It is interesting to see the people behind the characters after watching about 60 episodes of this superhero program, especially since in some cases the characters are so far from the innate personalities of the people playing the parts, then again, some of the characters aren't so far from the personalities of their actors. ;)",1473724800,,386,4.848484848484849
8685623,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,Big fan of POI.  When regular programming ended at 4 seasons I felt like we had been left in the dark for no reason; it bothered me.  Now I'm happy,1473638400,,147,3.8666666666666667
8685624,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,Love the show and wanted to see the actors in a different setting.  Well worth it,1470009600,,81,4.0625
8685625,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,It was great!,1469923200,,13,3.6666666666666665
8685626,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,Great interview of the cast.  It's so interesting to see the personality of the actors compared to the characters that they portray on POI.,1468022400,,139,4.791666666666667
8685627,5,B00OZ0ARZ4,"As a devoted fan of Person of Interest, I found it exciting to see the actors and writers talk about what they do.",1466640000,,114,4.0
