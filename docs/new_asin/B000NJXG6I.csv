2770922,5,B000NJXG6I,"The O.C.

Season 4 is absolutly AMAZING. In every aspect of the word. The Finale was beautiful. This season was the perfect way to end this pop culture phenomenon.

R.I.P. The OC

2003-2007",1173139200,4,189,4.666666666666667
2770923,1,B000NJXG6I,"I can't believe that they ruined The OC with this dreadful season. The first three seasons were beyond awesome, and it saddens me to see The OC saying good bye with such a bad season.

There were only two episodes that I liked: ""The Night Moves"" and ""The End's not near, it's here"". So I guess they did gave it a proper ending with those last two episodes, but the rest of the season SUCKED!!

I own the other three seasons on DVD but I will definitely not buy this one. I can't believe how some people actually liked it!!",1173052800,8,522,4.21
2770924,5,B000NJXG6I,"For those who aren't sure if Season 4 would be good after a terrible season 3, I assure you that this is a great rebound.  I didn't expect much after Marissa's death, but the show rebuilt itself from the ground up in the 4th Season.  The show was dying on its old legs and dynamics, but with the colossal event that changed the series, Marissa's death, new life was breathed into the show.

You'll find much more comedy this season than in Season 3, much like in the show's glory days in Season 1.  So if you strayed from this show after a mediocre to decent Season 2 and a terrible Season 3, your faith should be restored with this one.",1172793600,12,637,4.239669421487603
2770925,5,B000NJXG6I,"The fourth season of The O.C. was one of the highlights of the 2006-2007 season. After a good but not outstanding second season and a very bad third one, the show finally began to face the sun that made its fame during its first speech perfect season. Yes, killing Marissa Cooper was a tough decision to make and the way it was taken care of wasn't really thrilling or good even if you hated that character. But then you watch the season premiere and you feel like her death was just useful.

The show finally focused on three characters portrayed by three amazing actors : Julie (Melinda Clarke), Summer (Rachel Bilson) and of course Ryan (Ben McKenzie). And it was just great again. The awesome and beautiful Autumn Reeser and Willa Holland were made regulars and they were a great addition to the cast, making sure the balance between drama and comedy was respected. In fact the season is more funny than dramatic. Because all the plotlines revolve about quality and light stuffs : new romances, old romances, babies, weddings, French talkshows, fun natural disasters, slutty aliens and of course family.

With great indie music, Christmukkuh and all the things that made The O.C. the phenomenon that redefined a generation, you will not want to miss this season which will only leave you with anger concerning the network that cancelled the show, Fox. But again you will think this is the perfect way to end this history. Rating : A",1172793600,5,1436,4.74
2770926,5,B000NJXG6I,"To rate the quality of the actual DVD is obviously premature, as it hasn't been released yet. But I can say that the quality of the actual season was superb. Simply brilliant, considering the assassination of my beloved show in Season 3. Only people who have not seen any of season 4 could possibly say that the show died with Marissa (who, despite not being seen at all this season, is listed on here as ""starring""). Sure, the network may have dropped it for that very reason, but Josh & Co. really got back to their season 1 greatness in this short, but rewarding final 16-episode-run. Now all we have to do is pray that the producers pile us up with some fantastic extra/special features to reward us fans!",1172707200,,709,4.503875968992248
2770927,3,B000NJXG6I,"The OC was finished half way through season 3.  Whoever said season 2 was mediocre... you know nothing about good television.  Season 2 was the best season in all of tv history! It was amazing!!! Season 3 started to lose me, but I still watched faithfully, and when season 4 came around I was done.  Hercules is Ryan's dad!? And Julie falls in love with him!?  C'mon... tacky tacky tacky.  I was ready for it to be over because they lost me. I still give 3 stars, though, because it's the OC!  I thought the very last episode was better than I expected, and it ended in a way that I didn't have questions. If you haven't seen the OC before, don't start with any of season 4... Please...",1172534400,6,686,4.27906976744186
2770928,5,B000NJXG6I,"And with these final 16 episodes, the once pop-cultural phenomenon ""The OC"" finally fades to white.  It had been a rocky road for the series and the characters over the 4-years that `The OC' aired on the FOX network, but through it all the series persisted.

The theme of season 4 was essentially `going back to the beginning' and that was exactly what happened in this final season.  Since all the main characters either died or graduated high school in the third season finale, the four season premier seemed more like a pilot than a season finale of a show near its end.  And for 15 additional episodes the writers brought the humor, wackiness, and pop cultural refrences that made the series so popular to begin with back, leaving the melodrama at a bare minimum.

I'm sad to see `the OC' go, it will always be a part of my history because for better or for worse I watched the show through every-one of its 94 episodes, and I will remember these characters fondly.  I also need to mention the series finale, which to my amazement didn't dissapoint in the least, it was lighthearted, fun, zany, and had all the right ingredients, and definitely worth a rental if you just want to see how the series comes to a close.

This DVD set contains all 16-episodes on 5 discs, in additional to deleted Scenes, Gag Reel, 2 Featurettes, as well as a commentary on the final episode, `The end is not Near, it's Here'",1172188800,56,1408,4.519685039370079
2770929,5,B000NJXG6I,"After a mediocre season 2 and a terrible season 3, The OC came back with a season 4 that was practically designed for the fans who stuck by it. From the fantastic new regulars playing Taylor Townsend and the Bullit way on back to Ryan, Sandy, Julie, Seth and the rest, with plot lines that (almost) never focused on ridiculously convoluted revenge or romance, this season was a joy to watch.

Thank you, Josh Schwartz-you let The OC end in the best season yet.",1172188800,6,460,4.476190476190476

2770958,5,B000NJXG6I,"After the lackluster storyline in Season 3, the O.C. was redeemed again in Season 4, but by that time it was too late.  The viewership dropped astronomically by the millions when Season 4 rolled around and never picked up momentum causing the Warner Bros., the studio behind the show to cancel the O.C. abruptly.  This abruptness was noticed towards the end of Season 4 when the O.C. experiences an Earthquake in the show.  The continuity is noticed at that point where the studio pulled the plug and suddenly the show is wrapped up quickly in a nice pretty bow.  Season 4 was an exceptional season after Season 3 dragged downward through one ridiculousness after another.  Season 4 starts off just as low as we're dragged through the aftermath of the Marissa Cooper death in Season 3 and then the revenge on the guy responsible, Volchak.  Once that wraps itself up after a few episodes, then the show begins to build steam upward again becoming interesting and moving in the way it was in Seasons 1 and 2.  Unfortunately many stopped watching the show by the time it hit Season 4.  You can notice the downward trajectory in viewers with Season 1 having 10 million viewers, Season 2 dropping to 7 million, Season 3 dropping to 6 million, and then Season 4 only having 4 million viewers left.  Not enough for the studio to keep shooting episodes.  It's a shame as Season 4 was better than 3.",1478390400,,1390,4.6138211382113825

2771010,4,B000NJXG6I,"Because this is the season I started watching OC, specifically the Christ-mukha episode, I have to give more than 4 stars. I didn't give 5 because Mischa Burton wasn't in it.
Let me tell about the Christ-macka episode. This is the one I watched the series for the first time. I only had a little idea about what this show is about, it kinda hooked me when Ryan explained what actually happened in the real world, while Ryan and Taylor were in the parallel universe.
I mean, duh, once I watched other seasons, Marissa was so screwed up and that's why I liked it (and hot). But that I didn't know at the point I watched it for the first time, I loved it.
Ryan is really cool character and Ben Mackenzie is a great actor. He may not have noticed how much he means to others, but ""3 months to live for Marissa"" must have had a huge push. I loved that part.
And after that, well, it's just ok, but I don't think there will be any better tv-show for a while.

2771027,4,B000NJXG6I,"The excitement of watching The O.C. Season 4 wore off quickly. After killing Marissa off in the season 3 finale, ruined the show and it was doomed for cancellation. It's unfortunate because they had a great show, ratings and support from fans. Please note, all TV writers, do not ever kill off your main female lead character because your show will die! The 4th season of The O.C. was a true testament to this. The finale was rushed, a lot put into one hour and they should had at least had two hours with the ability to finish it out better and not rushed. However, the FOX network could not afford to lose additional ratings for the second hour, I am sure. In any event, the stories are mediocre.

If you have purchased the first three season, this one is only 16 episodes. You may as well invest in the last season to see them off!

2771071,5,B000NJXG6I,"+Fair Warning+ this will contain the major season 3 spoiler and some hints, but nothing major from the final season.  If you have not yet seen the third season (which is unlikely by now) avoid the first couple paragraphs.

The final season of the OC rebounded nicely from the mess that was (at least at times) season 3.  It was the shortest season in the entire run (going 16 episodes) which I think did the show some good.  The first half of the season was all about Ryan (and Julie) coping with the death of Marissa.  Julie essentially recruits Ryan to go after Volchuck to exact revenge, which of course Ryan is all too willing to do, While Sandy, Seth and Kirsten try to get him to stop pursing Volchuck and come home.

Once that part of the story is ended, the focus is really on wrapping up the series.  The various relationships are tested again, but luckily not by unlikable characters as in past seasons.  The focus is kept (as it should be) on the remaining core characters, with a few ancillary characters (including an appearance by Ryan's father) mixed in.

The final episode gives a nice glimpse back at the series as well as a flash into the future to get a glimpse of where the characters ultimately end up.  It is not really a show that requires everything be tied up in a little bow at the end, but I think it does of good job of wrapping up the series.

As far as extras go, there are commentary tracks on a couple episodes, and a few featurettes on the 5th disc.  The focus being on the evolution of Christmakah and the evolution of Summer as a character.  Not a ton of material, but good for what is there.",1412553600,,1627,4.347682119205298

The characters are great and the drama/humor mix makes this show a lot of fun. This season for me continued the same feeling at the third season. It was good and interesting, but it didn't have the same laid back fun feeling of the first (and most of the second season). I gave this season three stars because there were a few episodes that were too far out there for me. Also because I enjoyed watching it but it didn't keep me as invovled and keep my interest as well as the past seasons have. The main reason I liked this season is because it ended well and left us on a high note.

I have loved other series (like Perry Mason; Boston Legal, The Fugitive, LAW and ORDER, Cold Case, Dexter and on and on and on) but somehow though I am no teeny bopper (far from it) I just fell in love with each character.

I am so pleased that I picked this show without really knowing what it was about and I now know. I didn't want the show to end and what a great ending it was.

2771208,5,B000NJXG6I,"The final season of one of the ALL-TIME greatest T.V. shows.. The show started out as a summer mid season replacement and grew to a worldwide Phenomena. Its stars, reaching life from the unknown to global stardom... This season itself started out quite dark after the death of Marissa Cooper(Mischa Barton). Ryan Atwood(Ben Mackenzie) is living a life as a bartender by day and a underground fighter by night, losing fights on purpose so he can receive the punishment(and pain) that he thinks he deserves.. Cut to a few episodes in. Summer Roberts(Rachel bison) and Seth Cohen(Adam Brody)are living together,but apart with Summer attending Brown University and caring more about the environment then what shoes are in season(true O.C. fans will understand the irony here). The weird item for this season is the introduction of Taylor Townsend (Autumn Reeser)as Ryan's new love interest.. The season was created as a tie up for all the characters to show how all their lives moved on after Marissa's death and the death of the show. Personally i LOVED this show. it was a fun and sometimes poignant family drama, in which even myself a(35 year old at the time)found myself with a tear in my eye more then once.. Josh Schwartz is a credit to the industry with his witty and edge full writing, while still being able to create a ""REAL"" existence to a elitist community.. If your a fan of ""Buffy the Vampire slayer(and its utmost awesome creator and scripe, Joss Whedon) and loved the way the show's witty humor pulled you in,then this show is for you..Welcome to the O.C.",1264723200,,1568,4.811111111111111
2771209,1,B000NJXG6I,"The fourth and final season opens with two very grim episodes showing the aftermath of Marissa's death.  Then, however, it's hilarity all the way as romances bloom for young and old and the series concludes with happily-ever-afters for everyone.

In his commentary, the show's creator labeled this season ""broad, romantic comedy,"" but for me, it was just ludicrous.  The plot lines were dumber and crazier than anything in Seth's 'Atomic County' comic book.  I think the writers knew the show was cancelled and decided to drop any pretense at serious drama and go for cartoon laughs.  Taylor Townsend had no redeeming qualities, yet she became a leading character and love interest for Ryan, who lost his noble and heroic edge.  Summer became a silly activist and acted like Seth's squabbling sibling.  Julie became involved with a  billionaire buffoon and Ryan's once-loathsome-now-good-guy father, and her suddenly-15-year old daughter Kaitlin went from unlikable delinquent to selfless daughter and true friend.

It's all too much and insulting to loyal fans who loved the show since it's wonderful first season.  They should have stopped after Mischa Barton left; the show was pointless without her.  There are only 16 episodes in this set and limited extras.",1258243200,3,1263,5.233830845771144

Well after watching the first 3 in rapid succession I just had to finish it up by viewing the last few episodes.  They had killed off one of the lead characters and that's just not right!

2771216,2,B000NJXG6I,"Many people loved the 4th season. I was disappointed. I guess because of the crash in the ratings - partly because of Grey's Anatomy - the writers thought they had to take the series in a new, direction, and so they turned the series into a farce.

Let me back up a bit. I loved the start of the 4th season, the conflict of Ryan trying to find Volchok, but once Volchok turned himself in there was no central, compelling conflict to propel the action. Instead there was an endless parade of comedy, most of which I didn't think worked.

Again we were introduced to more unbelievable characters: Che and Bullit that made me groan.

Yes, it was nice to see Kaitlin and Taylor grow, but I still found Taylor somewhat annoying and unrealistic.

Sandy Cohen became more of a spectator than someone taking part in the action. I don't know why he wasn't given a stronger, dramatic storyline. For exammple, now that he was back in the Public Defender's office, why couldn't he have a new, compelling client, perhaps a young woman who shares a bond with Ryan?

I liked the way Summer and Julie evolved for the better.

Finally, I loved the way the series ended. (Yes, I had tears in my eyes.) Afterward, I listened to Josh Schwart'z commentary, and heard him say he was definately going for comedy in season 4. I suspect he forgot that one of the things that made the O.C. so addicting was the way it went back and forth from comedy to drama. Also, I rewatched the pilot. It was a compelling, dramatic episode that got the series off to a bang - viewers loved it and became addicted to the show - and yet the pilot wasn't that funny.

IMHO, what sunk the OC was a bad, first half of the 3rd season, where we were introduced to several unlikeable characters and unbelievable storylines.

I suspect is the writers of The OC never figured out where they lost their way.

Anyway, that's my two cents. It's certainly a lot easier criticizing a series than writing one.

Thanks Josh and everyone else who worked on the show for some great tv!",1243382400,3,2027,4.454054054054054

Either way, the season started a little slow.  It starts with 5 months later after the 3rd season finale and shows how everyone is coping after the tragedy in which the 3rd season ended.  I think Taylor (Autumn Reese) saved this final season.  She did an excellent job at being bright, funny, scheming and somehow was always there to save the day. I loved her and Ryan together.
The only thing I hated about this season is that every couple became and on again off again couple...even Julie Cooper couldn't make up her mind who she wanted to be with.  They had us guessing the whole season.
They brought Marissa's little sister back to the show, Kaitlyn, but her scenes weren't worth watching. I kept fastforwarding every time she came on. Who cares about Harbor High after Marissa, Ryan, Seth and Summer graduated?
I still highly recommend this season especially just for the series finale alone.  I loved seeing the future of each character.  Fantastic ending to a fabulous show!",1220832000,,1150,4.635467980295567

2771235,2,B000NJXG6I,"The season started out awful and there were only a few glances of the show from past.

Ryan is a cage fighter!!!  Come on, yes you heard me right a CAGE FIGHTER.  Isn't this the same person who gets beat up almost everytime he got into a fight with someone?  I also think that no matter how good of a speech Sandy Cohen can give you, if you go months trying to locate someone to kill them you aren't going to find them and only punch them.

Summer decides as a way to avoid dealing with Marissa dying she will go to Brown and become a hippie activist, and apparently stop grooming.

Julie must have some secret power which she uses on men.  How do you throw a man out of his own house and him apparently just accept it.  Also you go from a state of cationic to being alright about your daughter's death in a span on 2 episodes.

Taylor just seems to be filler.  She shares too much with people that she barely knows.  She just moves into Summer's room and no one seems to notice or care that she is there.

Kaitlin comes home so she can rule the school since Marrisa was going to be graduating, but and scenes they show of school most people don't really like her unless she is throwing a party, except for the twins.

Seth is just Seth

I usually I have to fight to go to bed cause with the show I want to see the next episode and with this season I fought to get through it just so I can be done with it",1211328000,4,1405,4.025270758122744
2771236,5,B000NJXG6I,"I must say, this was probably the best season yet. Of course, it was pretty much an entirely different show, seeing as how the characters were no longer in high school, and it just went in an entirely different direction than the previous seasons (it reminded me of 90210 after they had all graduated high school, and the cast was almost an entirely different group of people) but it was, in all honestly, the first season where all the characters were actually likeable. The only downside being that some of the episodes were extremely corny (come on, the christmas episode was completely ridiculous)

And Ok, I know a lot of people will probably hate me for saying this, but I was kind of happy that Marissa was gone, and I was interested to see what the show would be like without her. I've always had an extreme love/hate relationship with her character. Ill admit, that in some ways, the show really wasn't as good without her on it, and at times I missed her, but at the same time it was a big relief, and a much needed change with the depature of her character.

I'm sorry, but it was always the same old story with Marissa. Every season, she whined and cried about how hard her life was, and always, ALWAYS there was some guy that would fall in love with her, come between her and ryan (think oliver and johnny!), and Marissa, the ditz that she was, would always deny it, even though everyone told her different and it was extremely annoying. I really don't know why ryan kept going back to her to be honest!

But don't get me wrong, she wasn't the only character that I disliked.

Summer (although I love her now)was extremely annoying in both the first and second season. In the first season she was annoyingly ditzy, and completely different than the summer you see in later seasons. the entire love-triangle between summer, seth, and anna during season one was extremely irritating.

Need I even mention Oliver, who was, and probably always will be, the most annoying character I've ever seen on a TV show.

Then in season two you have the extremely dull Zach, who bought nothing of interest to any of the storylines, and of course there was Jess, the character you wanted to just reach through the screen and bitch slap.

Ryan was irritating, just for the mere fact that all during the first three seasons, he did nothing but get in fights with people. I actually lost count of how many fights he got into during season one alone!

Julie Cooper was also a highly despicable character, especially during season one. She came to grow on me as her character changed little by little, until she finally became a great character in  season 3, and especially during the 4th season. You can't help but be touched as you watch her grieve over the loss of her daughter, yet you also can't help but feel bad for kaitlin, the daughter she ignores.

Seth is the only character I've actually liked during all four seasons. The show definitely wouldn't have lasted as long as it did without the humor you get from his character.

Another good thing was Taylors transformation, from being one of the most annoying characters ever on the show (I despised her during season 3), to becoming an actual likeable character. During this season I found her to be quite funny, and found myself actually coming to appreciate her presence.

I think my favorite character of them all is Kaitlin Cooper, who is as different from Marissa as day and night. The only thing I didn't understand was why they didn't show her, along with the rest of the characters, grieving over the loss of her sister. You get no emotion from her whatsoever on that particular issue, which is extremely odd.

All in all, the fourth season is one I would definitely recommend. The first episode is briliant. Even my mom, who has never liked the show, was impressed with the way they did the first episode. Everything from the characters grieving, to the music they play, is nothing short of amazing.

I believe that the show could have gone on even longer than it did, atleast for a season or two more, but nevertheless, I was satisified with the series finale, as well as the rest of season 4.",1211068800,3,4156,4.576043068640646

2771238,4,B000NJXG6I,"****SPOILERS****

The O.C. is a great show, but this season loses that O.C. feeling. It's a good season, it just feels like a different show. With the death of their best friend Marissa, Ryan, Seth and Summer must cope with the tragedy. Julie is affected greatly also. Let me say that the third season finale with Marissa's death TOTALLY shocked me. I couldn't even believe that it was happening...literally. I don't understand why they had to kill her. I mean, why her? She was awesome! But if you loved her also, you will be affected by the emotion of this season.

Everyone's trying to deal with her death and it really upsets you as a viewer. The dialogue is sometimes heartbreaking, and even being a guy it is really sad. Taylor becomes a main character this season and having her and Ryan have a serious relationship is kind of upsetting. I guess he has to move on and everything...but I mean come on, Marissa is his girl and will always be his girl. They were soul mates. I mean really, on TV dramas like this, you usually know who's gonna end up with who. Before Marissa died, you totally thought that by the series finale they would be together. But in this case no. Some of the relationships are kind of disappointing (Julie-Frank, Taylor-Ryan). I like Julie and Frank and all...but it just doesn't seem like The O.C. It feels like they were pushing it a little.

That being said, this season is really good and has really good episodes, all good storylines. The best episode this season is The Cold Turkey. It's really sad and really affects you if Marissa was your favorite character.

P.S. I still can't believe The O.C. is over. It was described as such a ""phenomenon."" But phenomenons don't last only 4 seasons. I still think it was because Mischa Barton leaving.",1208476800,2,1778,4.599369085173501

2771259,4,B000NJXG6I,"When I first heard about the show I was sceptical but I gave it a try. So, Season 1 was probably the best season of a TV show I have seen so far. Sadly, the show could not live up to the high expectations in season 2 and 3. The story was just too weird and too extreme in my opinion with a lot of unnecessary characters (Johnny etc). Surprisingly, as some guys noted before, the show recovered nicely in its fourth season, though not quite as good as the first one. The show regained its good sense of humor and relationships were, for most part, more credible than in the previous two seaons.

I think Autumn Reeser does a pretty good job taking the co-lead female role, showing some very good acting skills. I have to admit really convincing performance. I could have well imagined her for further seasons of the O.C.

What I can still not understand is how it got cancelled. Ok, granted, season 2 and 3 were not too exciting. Still, it seems like the few TV shows that are worth watching get cancelled too soon. And others, without naming them, are running for the 10th season or something. Strange.",1198800000,,1102,4.397058823529412
2771260,5,B000NJXG6I,"Season 1 of the O. C. is touted as being the best, and while it was extraordinary, it didn't match up to the final season.  I struggled through season 2 and 3, watched it over and over, but found the storylines and characters dark and depressing.  Marissa's death was like a personal death in our family and I thought I, nor the series could never pull out of the darkeness.  But Season 4 was a true winner!  Autumn Reeser, Taylor Townsend, was transformed into a likeable, neurotic delight.  The best part was she knew she had problems.  My favorite line to Ryan was, when she set up Ryan , herself and Frank for Dinner, and said I know I am meddling, after I get this stalker issue resolved, that's what I am going to work on next.  You just loved her more and more with each episode. While her french husband was a bit of a distraction, there were some funny moments, like everytime she heard the word peaches, she clutched hers.  Ryan finally translating the french divorce documents was funny, and of course, him being the ultimate hero, saving her at the very last second from having to go back to that dianmal marriage in France.  The Peach torte reward  was amusing too.  And Kaitlin, Willa Holland, became a genuinely likeable character. Trying to capture her  little girl, just looking for love and stability. I love the scenes with her and Bullit.  He calling her squirt, and him letting her get the Ferrari purring, he'll be right out. Ping Pong, , so normal yet so bizarre.  Her Manipulation of this billionaire tycoon on how to woo her Mom was funny.  Ryan reached his potential as a Human and lost some of the defensive baggage he had in all the prior seasons. All 4 of them watching Meerkat Manor after Sandy slugged Frank was a classic Cohen moment.  Sandy and Kirsten are a true love story.  Sandy, the tough New Yawrker, and Kirsten the Belle of Newport, their chemistry never failed to entertain me.  I wish I had a marriage like that!  Season 4 was happy, funny and the witty quips just keep on coming.  So sorry it is gone, but my DVD's will live on.
Thanks O>C>

2771262,4,B000NJXG6I,"The show certainly functioned perfectly without Mischa Barton's heinous acting (was she ever able to take a swig of alcohol without putting her anorexic arm over her lips and grimacing? Watching her drink is a drinking game in and of itself). Her replacement, Taylor, is the first beautiful, intelligent, if neurotic, character to grace the OC, and she was believable as an Honors student who had finally found her niche. She also provided one of Ryan's first real relationships, devoid of family drama (""Is she your aunt?"" ""Is she your step-aunt?"" ""Is she your cousin?"" ""Is she pregnant,"" etc.)

Clarke's acting in this season jumped up a notch, particularly in scenes with Ryan, and her daughter, Kaitlin. The prostitution ring was a little forced, but ultimately funny, and I enjoyed their treatment of the ""nasty women in Newport."" An Orange County-ite myself, I wouldn't mind telling a few people I know that they have chlamydia.

Although originally annoyed by Bullit, I came to enjoy him with time. Not as a replacement for either of her Herculean counterparts (and, let's face it, Kevin Sorbo's voice is one of the sexiest sounds on this planet), but as a father figure for Kaitlin. In their scenes together, she pulls herself from her Riverside-bred ""J-sparking"" trailer trash beginnings, and approaches the sweetness that you would expect from someone nicknamed ""Squirt.""

Granted, I had officially grown tired of Seth's constant lisping irony, but his presence always is good for a laugh, and was the perfect backdrop to watching Ryan truly grow up, and mature into an adult. There was far less fighting over this season (although Sandy throws a punch or two), bringing us back to the roots of the show: The Cohen family's acts of ""Mitzah's"" or simple human kindness. In the last episode, the OC comes full circle, with Ryan extending a hand to help someone in need.

The best line of the season? ""Toaster strudel! You're the best cook ever!""",1196035200,2,1953,4.945121951219512
2771263,3,B000NJXG6I,"It was a tough place to come back from, the downbeat ending of Season 3.  But it was healthy that they did come back, tie up the loose ends and give a credible finale to the lives of our heroes in Newport, as they go their separate - and sometimes a little unexpected -  ways.

Tonally, the series starts off incredibly bleak as Ryan reaches an all time low, Summer and Seth have yet another problem placed in their path to eternal romance and even Sandy and Kirsten have some surprises in store... however, a few episodes in the tone changes radically.  New characters are brought in, and it looks scarily like they are setting us up for The OC: The New Generation... and it sits very badly.  Kaitlin, Marissa's younger sister is at first an annoying jailbait version of Marissa, but to give the writers credit she really becomes a fleshed out character in quite a short time.  However, her hangers-on at school seem squarely pitched at a younger audience, as do a few of her storylines.  Her mother's new boyfriends also take on a sillier bent than they have in the past, reaching a nadir with Bullit the oilman.  Even the otherwise starworthy performance from Rachel Bilson as Summer Roberts is blighted by a juvenile ecowarrior companion.  Thankfully, he fades away as the season progresses.

These sillier elements get the season off to a bumpy start and knock off a star from the season - but from there it gets better as the elements that have made the show a success are reintroduced.  Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson) has really come into her own and her relationship with Seth reaches interesting new places.  The drama inherent in growing up and leaving home adds new energy to the show, and even the at-first-annoying Taylor plotline with Ryan helps get away from the ever repeating will-they won't-they episodes that blighted the third season to some extent.

The final episode is a disappointment for most of it, going deliberately far off the rails to start off with, in order to gain audience support when they put it all right again.. however, it does seem like largely a wasted opportunity... until the last 5 minutes, when the tearful farewells to homes and between characters should tug at the heartstrings of longtime fans.

So it is an odd mix of 1 star moments and 5 star moments but it all comes out right in the final mix.  None of the show reaches any deep intellectual places, but for fans of the hyper-reality of sun, sexy teens, rich Californian surfing town and soap opera story lines with a dose of issues of the day - Season 4 is no disaster, and not one to miss if you have seen the rest of the series.  Newcomers however, should look elsewhere to start.",1195171200,,2685,4.609243697478991

2771286,4,B000NJXG6I,"The O.C. started as a pop culture phenomenon and unfortunately, continued to go downhill with each new season.  It lost the magic that made the first year work so well, and that was no more evident in season three, easily the worst of the series.  And by killing off Marissa Cooper, a core original character, it was a wonder how the show would even begin to get back on it's feet for the final round.

One thing that the writers absolutely failed at throughout the course of the show was pushing a vision that they believed they had accomplished, when in reality, the fans saw something else entirely.  Here, in season four, they finally acknowledge what their show actually had going for them.

Case in point, the writers believed that the Ryan and Marissa relationship was the signature couple of the series when in reality, the Seth and Summer relationship was what the fans tagged for that honor.  In season four, the writers finally give this couple the due credit it deserved by actually having Seth and Summer put honest work and effort into making their relationship work rather than break them apart numerous times over silly, trivial issues as many times as they did in season three.

As for Ryan, the initial idea of Ryan and Taylor may have sounded odd, but it works in a way that Ryan and Marissa never did.  Because hard as it probably was for the writers to acknowledge, Marissa may have been a core character but she was never a hugely popular one in comparison to the rest of the cast.  Everytime they tried to give her a new problem to garner sympathy for her, the fans only came to resent her.  She constantly needed saving from Ryan because of someone else or worse, herself.  Taylor on the otherhand was just as insecure as Marissa in some ways, but was a lighter, feistier, more livlier personality.  The entire series was based on giving Ryan, a kid from the other side of the tracks, a chance at a better life and to be happy.  No one wanted to see him stuck with the perpetual downer that was Marissa Cooper.  There is a difference between good drama and tiring cycles, and Ryan and Marissa were definitely the latter.

Lastly in terms of the supporting characters, everyone's story seemed to wrap up nicely and logically for the series.  Julie Cooper spent the whole series marrying one rich man to the next, so having her fall for a poor one was truly a great way to bring this character full circle.  I would have rather had Jimmy Cooper be brought back for that honor, but suffice to say, the way it is actually executed still works.  Her daughter Kaitlin also tones down a bit from the insufferable brat that she was in season three to a more delightful and enjoyable personality.  Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, the heart of the show, are also given a great surprise near the end of the series... it actually made me want to see another season of the show if only to see a glimpse of life with the newcomer and their boys.

Season four isn't as smart and memorable as the first, but no season of the show has been.  But it is, at the very least, the best runner-up to the first season's original glory and, given the tangled mess it made of itself for the most part in season three, rebounds to a nice finish that for once, the fans will truly appreciate.",1187568000,,3281,4.48989898989899

2771288,3,B000NJXG6I,"Big OC fan from the beginning but I was very disappointed with Season 4 (as well as 3).  It seemed like the tentative renewal of the series for Season 4 handicapped the creativity of the series after a certain point.  Fox tentatively agreed to a fourth season as long as there would be a distinct improvement in the writing and direction of the show.  This never happened as the show retained its characteristic predictability.

Once it became clear the show wasn't meeting the expectations of Fox and that the show would be cancelled, the cast and writers seemed to kinda phone their performances and scripts in to play out the string.  It wased like the last day of school over the final eight or so of the sixteen epsiodes.  No story line was really deeply explored; everything seemed light and the writers circumvented the typical OC drama.

The show could have easily survived without MB.  Don't believe me?  Let me tell you about at little thing I like to call 'sarcasm.'  From the beginning it was clear that the show was stolen by ""the Ironist"" Seth Cohen himself.  How many ""Now Start a Band"" t-shirts and Rooney CD's was he responsible for selling?

The show also became progressively more hippee and political throughout its run; with Summer dealving into ""environmental whackoism"" and all of the litigation against evil developers who were destroying wetlands.  Onerously trampling on private property rights is definitely a waste of rage blackouts.

Mistake number one with the very successful O.C. was moving it to Thursday night in season two.  This was just plain cocky.  When viewership fell off the correct thing to do would have been to go back to the original night.  As for cancelling the show when it still had respectable numbers; I have but one question for Fox:  What are you going to replace it with that will garner half the numbers that the O.C. achieved?  Nothing so far has materialized.  This was a character driven show and it had that certain chemistry amongst it's cast that a network dreams about.  The prudent thing for Fox to have done would have been to expend creative efforts into revamping the show to hold on to it's faithful viewers and generate renewed interest from it's former followers.",1186185600,2,2233,4.793193717277487
2771289,1,B000NJXG6I,"First of all, I can't even begin to comprehend how anyone enjoyed this season. Many people have written that the season is surprisingly good despite the criticism. I want to inform potential season 4 victims that this season is absolutely horrible. If you understand what makes a good network show, then you will agree that the season is worthless. Without Mischa Barton the series lacks life, which becomes even more evident when the producers desperately try to replace her with Autumn Reeser. While Autumn is an unbelievably hot girl, this effort cannot salvage the remainder of the series, and it turns out to be a disappointment. Summer becomes a hippie? Why? Seth defers a year to go to RISD...If they are really the wealthy family the show makes them out to be, why can't he go to college. Not only that, RISD is not a good school. Furthermore, Summer would have never got into Brown. If someone as hot as Summer got into Brown, she would be the hottest girl in Brown's historic existence (this is true, I go to an Ivy League school, the girls are grim). Anyway, I guess I am trying to emphasize the fact that the plot begins to make absolutely no sense. Obviously, the first seasons aren't completely realistic either, but they have at least a shred of truth in them. I mean who is Volchek, that is such B.S. The guy would never pull Mischa Barton: he doesn't have a four year degree, he's ugly, and he's poor. Please, let's be realistic. If you want my opinion they should have had me producing. All the characters should have all been in the same area for college, they should have ditched Sandy and Kirstin back in the beloved O.C. and gone to college to get drunk, blackout, and have sex with everyone in sight.

2771294,2,B000NJXG6I,"Not that Mischa Barton is a great actress or anything, but watching this final season of The OC makes you realize she did bring at least 25% of everything that was great about the show, to the table. I mean, The OC without Marissa, is like ""Invasion"" without Mariel. It just doesn't work.

Add to that the fact that many of the characters are at least ten years older than the characters they are playing. I don't know if any of you noticed it, but Adam Brody started looking really old here (hes in his late 20s) and the role just did not work. The actor seemed really tired.

Benjamin McKenzie is exactly ten years older than the character he plays here, and the fourth season is when I totally lost any love I may have had for this character. The actor just got very weak - and the performances are, dare I say it, strange.

Pity, because despite being a show that perhaps had one of the greatest seasons in TV History (Season 1), Season 4 seems like an afterthought. Season finales are done well if in the right hands, like ""Six Feet Under"" but here, it just flits by so quickly. No, no, no. The OC deserved better than this.

If I were you, I'd rent these. Keep those Season 3 DVDs that have Mischa Barton in them - all the good directing and acting ended with Season 3.",1183593600,3,1275,4.278008298755187
2771295,5,B000NJXG6I,"Having loved the first season of The OC, but being slightly disappointed with seasons two and three, I found four to be a refreshing return to the show I loved. The replacement of Marissa's character with, in my opinion, a much more entertaining and likeable one helped turned this show around, and Ryan's new-found chattiness and humour also made the entire series fun to watch. Another extremely enjoyable part was the evolution of Julie Cooper-Nichol-Roberts as a character. I especially liked the finale, which ended perfectly: all storylines tied up well; sad and yet happy. I loved this final season of The OC, and would recommend it to any fan.",1182902400,,651,4.927272727272728
2771296,5,B000NJXG6I,"With the death of Marissa Cooper bringing to an end the third season of The O.C., things certainly had to swing upward with the start of the fourth season. While the first few episodes of what turned out to be the final season of this addictive primetime soap opera were a little sluggish, the rest of the season was a return to the glory of season one, albeit a little too late to salvage the show.

Coming into season four, it was likely that this would be the last season for the show, one of my favorites and midway through the season it was announced that the show would conclude after 16 episodes. The announcement did give creator Josh Schwartz enough time to pen a great ending, one that wrapped the series up in a nice bow and presented it to the fans who had been with the show since day one.

But starting the season was tough, as it was six months after Marissa was killed in a traffic accident caused by bad boy Volchok. Ryan (Ben McKenzie) is still traumatized over the death of the girl who had changed his life, and as we open the season, he is working in a seedy bar and cage fighting. But, he has connections with Marissa's mom, Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke), who reaches out to him when her private investigator finds out where Volchok is located.

Ryan's distance is hard on Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten Cohen (Kelly Rowan), as they struggle with watching their adopted ""son"" fall on hard times. In the first few episodes, Ryan is finally convinced to come home to Newport Beach and begin mending his life and his heart.

The early part of the season takes viewers on a trip to Mexico as Ryan and Seth (Adam Brody) look for Volchok south of the border. Sandy and Kirsten follow and eventually, Volchok turns himself in, with Sandy's help, keeping Ryan from going off the deep end and killing him as he truly wanted to do. Sandy's act not only helps Volchok, but helps Ryan stay out of trouble and on the right side of the law.

From there, the season picks up and returns to the soapy drama and humor that made it such a hit in the first season. This season truly found the groove again, thanks in part to a great casting move, one that anybody watching season three would've found hard to believe.

The show runners brought in Taylor Townsend (the gorgeous Autumn Reeser) in season three, seemingly as a foil for the main characters. While she was only a guest star during that season, the new season finds her among the regular stars in the opening credits and her addition to the full time cast was a blessing. She truly brought a lot of the  humor that the show needed. Taylor has been away in France in college for the six months since graduation and returns to California with a wedding ring and a need to escape her French husband, Henri-Michel. She finds her reason in Ryan, though their relationship takes some great twists and turns along the way. Ryan trying to express his feelings for Taylor is pretty funny and when Henri-Michel comes to Newport to woo Taylor back to France, it becomes obvious that he has feelings for her even if he can't completely express them.

The relationship with Taylor is Ryan's main story throughout the season, as he is still having a hard time letting go of the memory of Marissa and can't commit to Taylor the way she wants. Watching him struggle to figure out what he is feeling provides a good dose of humor.

Summer (the beautiful Rachel Bilson) has spent her first semester at Brown University where she has undergone major changes. Instead of the Newport girl that left Seth, she is now an environmental activist, wreaking havoc on the Rhode Island campus with her new friend Che (guest star Chris Pratt, who is hilarious in this role). When she gets kicked out of school for setting rabbits free from their cages, she returns to Newport and has to face the fact that her best friend is gone, something she had been putting on a back page during her activist stage.

Seth is working in a comic book store, leaving long messages on Summer's answering machine, longing for the days when he had Ryan and Summer to keep him company in Newport. He soon gets both of them back and things seem to return to ""normal"" for Seth despite the fact that Summer has obviously changed.

Julie and Kirsten continue as business partners in New Match, a high-end dating service that Julie turns into a male prostitution ring, temporarily ruining her friendship with Kirsten. It is through this business that Julie meets Gordon Bullitt (guest star Gary Grubbs) and Ryan's father, Frank Atwood (guest star Kevin Sorbo). Unable to decide, Julie dates both men, unable to make a choice in her life, despite the best efforts of her daughter Kaitlin (Willa Holland) to get her to choose the wealthy Bullitt.

The return of Ryan's father also brings trouble, much like the return of his mother and brother in previous seasons. Frank has been in jail and initially, Ryan wants nothing to do with him, but Frank lies to get Ryan to see him and the two slowly begin to mend the fences that came down quickly in the past. Ryan even helps Frank on the Julie front, teaming with Taylor to form ""Team Frank.""

Sandy and Kirsten get a major surprise on Kirsten's 40th birthday, as she reveals she is pregnant and instead of having an empty nest, the couple will be welcoming a new baby, though both parents cringe at the thought of raising another kid in Newport.

Perhaps the highlight of the season was the Chrismukkah episode, where Ryan and Taylor fall off a ladder and end up in an alternate Newport, where Sandy is mayor and married to Julie, Kirsten is still working at the Newport Group and married to Jimmy Cooper (guest star Tate Donovan), Seth is still a geek and Summer is marrying Che (or Chester as he's known in the alternate world). This episode allowed the stars to play different characters for a while and was pretty funny to watch.

The final few episodes wrap the series up very nicely. An earthquake rattles Orange County, putting everyone in danger and it is revealed that the Cohen house has been destroyed. This leads Ryan and Seth on a mission to Berkeley to try and purchase Sandy and Kirsten's first house even as a pregnant (with Frank's kid) Julie prepares to marry Bullitt (and yes, he knows). Sandy and Kirsten fly to Berkeley and end up having the baby in their old house, prompting Julie and Bullitt to move the wedding there as well, eventually convincing the new owners to sell the house to Sandy and Kirsten.

The final few minutes glimpses into the future of the characters, looking at what Ryan, Summer, Seth, Sandy, Kirsten, Julie, Kaitlin and the whole group is up to. It is a great way to end, with everyone seemingly in a good place, just where you might hope they'd be.

This set also has some good extras, which add to the release. Schwartz provides commentary on the series finale and it is well done and informative. There is a couple of good featurettes, one on the creation of Seth's holiday blend, Chrismukkah and another on the evolution of the Summer character, focusing on her transformation from Newport Barbie to well-rounded young woman. Her character did go through possibly the most changes throughout the four-year history of the show.

All told, the season wrapped up well, surely leaving viewers pleased and as a big fan of the show, I think this DVD set did a great job presenting the final 16 episodes.",1182816000,3,7408,4.57811320754717
2771297,5,B000NJXG6I,"After an amazing first season, decent second season, and kinda bad third season, one would expect that the fourth and final season for The OC would be the worst. Well, that wasn't the case. The show bounced back and even with substantially less episodes than the previou seasons, the show actually had its seconed best season ever, behind season one of course.

The best thing about season four was that the show actually found its sense of humor, which was absent for most of season two and all of season three. Taylor made for an excellent source of comedy and season four, and was a great addition to the cast for the final season. Kaitlin was also a great addition to the cast, and helped make probably the funniest OC episode ever (and my personal favorite of the season) 'The Summer Bummer' so amazing. The Series Finale was okay, not amazing, but there was definitely closure and that's really all you can ask for. Overall, season four was a great way to end the show. At the end of the day, you have to thank FOX for giving us these 16 episodes.",1182556800,,1053,4.484375

I never viewed season one when it originally aired, I did see an episode here & there but I didn't really get hooked until I got the first season as a birthday present two years ago. I still watch it!! I've enjoyed every season. Lots of viewers like to compare the seasons, which one was the best & which one was the worst. All I can say is that I've enjoyed all the seasons & I've enjoyed watching the characters grow & seeing relationships end & others begin. It's truly a very well written, well casted series. The music, the sets, the clothes & the characters mostly are amazing. I did miss that Marissa isn't in this season & I was very upset when I found out that they killed her off but it was enjoyeable seeing where the show went after that happened & it was something very real that people have to face & deal with everyday. The cast did amazing in season four of portraying the greif & loss of just losing a best friend, soulmate & daughter. Marissa was my favorite character & I missed her but I enjoyed getting to know other characters better this season such as Taylor & Katelyn. Taylor really lit up the show & kinda shed some light during a very dark situation. Autumn Reeser is amazing!! I've only viewed disc one so far but once I finish the entire season, I'll update my review. I'd also have to say that the packaging & artwork are perfect as usual. Also, I got my copy at Target where they are selling a limited edition of season four. It's 5$ more but it's worth it. You get a bonus disc of special features which is over an hour long. Still haven't got to check those out though but I know that once they're gone, they won't be selling anymore so if you haven't gotten this season yet, you might wanna check at Target!!

I am glad I have the last season but wish there had been more special features. The things about Summer was cute and it really gave you a look at the character through Rachel's view. I haven't watched the other disks yet so hopefully there are more deleted scenes on those. I didn't see any gag reels either which was unfortunate. But if you can find it at a cheap price it is worth it to have the final season. I don't think it is worth the retail price though...atleast not yet.,1180396800,2,592,4.247787610619469

I did listen to the commentary on ""The End's Not Near, It's Here"" and it was fantastic. Josh is funny, informative, and self-deprecating and it makes for a very satisfying commentary to the finale. It would have been nice though if some cast members contributed to the commentaries though.

The cover art is my favorite, I think, out of all the other seasons. Honestly though every cover has been really great each season. The only problem is that they aren't consistent. It's too bad that 3 and 4 didn't follow the same trend as 1 and 2, but at the same time the differences are nice. I miss the montages.

I also hate the two-disc trays. But they aren't horrible I suppose.

And instead of giving some sort of presence of Marissa in season 4, the show's viewers are dumped in 5 months later, not able to mourn, and the characters essentially resolve their grievences for her death in 5 episodes.  The O.C. ended with a  very prolonged whimper.",1176508800,9,574,4.9375
2771322,5,B000NJXG6I,"I deeply regret both that FOX didn't order a slate of episodes for THE O.C.'s final season and even more strongly regret that they cancelled it when it still had a lot of life left in it.  Season Three had been a thudding disappointment that both chased off a lot of previous fans and made FOX consider ending it.  The network never really gave it a chance in its final season, putting it in a timeslot in which it couldn't possible maintain strong ratings.  Nonetheless, after the dismal third season, it was great to see the series regain the charm that had made it so much fun to watch in its first and most of its second season.

One of the reasons for the success of the show in the fourth season is that they finally seemed to realize that the endless number of hated characters that popped up over the years were simply that:  hated.  They were not characters we loved to hate, we simply didn't like them.  It all started with Oliver and then mushroomed in the next two seasons, exploding in Season Three.  But this year they managed to avoid introducing any truly awful characters.  I never really warmed up to Ch&eacute; and Taylor's French ex-husband was not very likable, but neither approached the loathsome characters of the first two season.  Instead, we were left mainly with the same characters that were the real reasons we enjoyed the show all along.

I must admit that at first I was leery about the reappearance of Taylor and Kaitlin.  The latter in Season Three seemed to be on the verge of being as self-destructive as Marissa had been.  With Marissa gone I was certain that Kaitlin was going to go down her path.  Instead, the writers took her character in a number of unexpected ways and she ended up being a delightful character.  But even more shocking was what they did with Taylor.  Even in Season Three they had done a great deal to redeem her character.  Taylor had started out as one of the least likable characters on the show, but they gradually made her sympathetic.  Still, at the end of Season Three she at most could be described as irritating.  This year they managed to make her actually likable.  And by the time that we realized that they were actually going to have her and Ryan get together I had actually warmed to her.  She was still high strung and obsessive, but she was also shown to be someone with a large heart.  And in a way that Marissa never was, she turned out to be good for Ryan.

All in all, the show had a good four-year run.  I think it had another year or two in it and would have enjoyed seeing it come back.  But given how terrible Season Three was, I must confess that my overwhelming feeling about Season Four was gratitude.  The most abused and meaningless phrase in talking about television is ""jumped the shark.""  If any show ever had truly jumped the shark, that was THE O.C. in Season Three.  But Season Four was a wonderful return to form.  I'm not sure that any other show ever had such a terrible year and then followed it with such a great one.  So it ended, but at least it ended well.  Not many series can make that claim.",1176163200,32,3098,4.420494699646643

2771336,5,B000NJXG6I,"I was a little dissappointed when I heard that THE OC was in it's final season. It started out, and pretty much remained, a good show. I didn't watch many episodes on TV, though, because I had to work nights. My sister watched them, though, so I was pretty glad when I heard that they were being released on DVD.

My sister was able to buy the first season. I bought her the next two. No, I'm not big on watching shows that were released almost a year old, but it's what I had to do.

Sometimes I noticed repeating themes or storylines that were very similar to ones that had been used before. But, they were able to tell the stories tongue-in-cheek, and usually made jokes about storylines being repetitive. I rather liked how each episode never came to a completely satisfying conclusion. Something would be left open. Seth & Summer might break up while Ryan & Marissa begin to get back together, while Sandy discovers his wife has a drinking problem, meanwhile Julie Cooper is working a scam.

Marissa's death at the end of Season 3 will go down in history as the episode that almost (almost) moved me to tears.

I liked that at the beginning of Season 4 they would have to restructure everything. Having moved out from my parent's house, I knew the show restructuring itself it was a lot like growing up. While ratings may have made THE O.C. close, it seemed like it was time. Kaitlin and her friends just could not replace the Fantastic Four's (meaning Ryan, Seth, the late Marissa, and Summer, not the Marvel superheroes) appeal. The FF had grown up. It was time for the show to close.

I was able to see how the last episode ended. It was just perfect, though I would've liked to have seen some definite hint that Ryan and Taylor (who replaced Marissa only as becoming a main character and becoming a new love interest for Ryan, I'm glad they didn't try to turn her into Marrissa) would go further than dating. And the final scene with Ryan seeing the kid was just perfect. ""Do unto others."" Just finally showing what may happen because of something similar done back in the first episode.

Just keep in mind the season 3 finale is actually the real final episode (cause in essence the show has always been tragic) and Season 4 is the epilogue - its basically to just follow up what happened in that season.

Ryan and Taylor's budding romance made for some of the best scenes since the first season. Taylor was a nice addition to the main core of characters. Her transition as a series regular made me forget about Marissa. Misha who?

However, the final 10 minutes of the very last episode was REALLY good.  Everything from those final moments were spectacular.  I won't give anything away, but it was simply beautiful, sad, and happy all wrapped in one.  The best ending I've ever seen for a show, perhaps.  I'm glad Fox gave the OC a proper ending.  So many times, with so many shows, it doesn't happen that way.

I think as far as bringing together loose storyline points, they did a nice job of wrapping everything up.  Every one of the main characters was featured in the final episode to give the viewer a proper and logical goodbye.  That alone helps me give Season 4 an overall rating of 3 stars.",1173225600,6,1086,4.489795918367347
8178921,3,B000NJXG6I,I loved the OC!! so much when it was aired that I recently started watching it starting from the beginning. I loved it as much as when it first aired until season 3's last episode. YOU CANNOT kill off one of the leading characters!!!!! I couldn't watch season 4 because it just didn't feel the same anymore. The back and forth love between Marissa and Ryan was one of the things that made the show amazing.,1521590400,,406,4.355263157894737

8178923,2,B000NJXG6I,I watched season 4 when the series was aired.  I also re-watched it on HULU.  It broke my heart that this series had to end but I understand why people stopped watching it.  Why on earth would you pair Ryan up with that stupid Taylor.  Taylor ruined this series.  She isn't Ryan's type at all.  i only give season 4 2 stars because I did like the fact that everyone ended up okay at the end.  But the last show???  I wish you could redo it.  The entire 4th season seemed like a world of stupidity.  These kids should have grown a little more prior to entering colleges.  They were after all the smart kids.,1519084800,,606,4.182608695652174
8178924,1,B000NJXG6I,The first and third disc didn't work at all. They would not play in any dvd player I tried. I found out that both dvd were empty. They had nothing on them. No episodes and no adds. I like this season the best. Marissa was too much drama.,1517011200,,237,3.9583333333333335
