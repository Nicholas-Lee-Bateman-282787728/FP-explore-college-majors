6708272,5,B00O2YPMNK,"The only bad thing about this show is they stopped making them. I felt kind of like Mr Lahey, ""What would I do without my Randy?"". Well, by some miracle they are again, and I was so impressed. The cast is doing what they do best, making me laugh my butt off!",1421625600,4,258,3.980769230769231

6708276,5,B00O2YPMNK,"I really miss watching TPB on TV.  I did subscribe to swearnet but stopped watching it because most of the content was behind the scenes footage and touring footage, rather than new comedy.  Also I bought Don't Legalize it and didn't really like it. This set feels a lot like the good old days.  I've just watched the 4th episode.

Looks like this time they filmed in another different trailer park.  I am glad to see most of the gang back. I wish that Trevor was back too but I understand that he and Corey were treated badly by Clattenberg, etc.  I am glad that Ray is no longer hogging the air time.  RIP Phil Collins.  I think I recognize Donald/Dawn from an earlier episode (""enchantee"").

I hope they make season 9 and keep going.

PS I wanted to add that there is only one thing I hated in Season 8: Bubbles using puppets AGAIN.",1419552000,5,835,4.329032258064516

6708285,3,B00O2YPMNK,Great to see the boys in action again but Im afraid they lost it. Definitely not as good as seasons 1-7 Mike Clattenburg no longer directs. Maybe they need him back. Don't know if I'm gonna buy season 9 yet.,1470355200,,207,4.2

6708314,5,B00O2YPMNK,"10 episodes that fly by. I didn't know what to expect since the original show's demise, but these guys have far surpassed the original. I think I even saw Trevor under the red hat at the hardware store. All the favorite characters are back, Cory, Sam Losco, Cyrus, Sebastian Bach,  George Green, Jacob, J ROC and T, the ROC Pile and even Steve Rodgers. A great story line, a funny new character with Don/Donna, and poor little Orangie and Talk-O. I think this was their best season ever, and I have their entire collection of movies, specials and the original series. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1430956800,,596,4.570093457943925
