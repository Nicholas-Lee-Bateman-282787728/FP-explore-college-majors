7903007,5,B000003K5T,"Plot:  Riker meets up with his a former captain (now admiral), named Eric Pressman.  Naturally, if an admiral turns up, there's a big problem that needs to be dealt with, as is this case.  The USS Pegasus, an Oberth-class prototype with new technologies, was then Capt. Pressman's ship 12 years ago and Riker was the helmsman.  Well, the ship is destroyed, except now, 12 years later, part of the ship has been found by the Romulans.  So, the Enterprise is to quickly find the Pegasus before the Romulans do.  But, there's more going on.  Pressman and Riker both hold a dark, deadly secret about one of the pieces of technology on the Pegasus.  Riker, who feels remorse over it, is torn between the admiral's orders and his sense of what is really right and true (and his loyalty to the rest of the ship and crew).  I won't spoil the end, but I can say this, the hilarious teaser with the ""Capt. Picard Day"" disguises how dangerous the mission may end up!!!  I really enjoyed this episode because it showed that if someone is above the law, there can be major consequences.  It also had some things that have never happened to the Enterprise, including entering an asteriod.  Arguably, one of the best episodes in series.",1157328000,,1221,4.601851851851852
7903008,5,B000003K5T,"I love it when we find flaws and dark pasts in our favorite Trek characters.  This time, Commander Riker is the subject and the secret he has been living with for twelve years is one that could alter Federation relations with the Romulan Empire forever!
Admiral Pressman, Riker's old commanding officer aboard the starship Pegasus, wants to retrieve the lost Pegasus because it has secret technology that the Pegasus crew had been working on when their experiments went awry (and the ship was lost).  The key is that the Pegasus's crew was working on cloaking technology which, as the episode explains, is illegal for the Federation to use.  Never mind the absurdity of such a treaty (c'mon, this is like the USA banning stealth fighter technology so we don't upset China and then allowing China to use stealth technology--it would be an incredibly stupid thing to do), the important thing here is the conflict generated among Picard, Pressman and Riker.  Riker is torn between loyalty to his former commander and his duty to the Enterprise and the Federation.  There are plenty of terrific, dramatic, and tense moments in this episode.  As Riker, actor Jonathan Frakes shines here.  Great episode all the way!
This episode, along with ""Second Chances"" and ""A Matter of Honor"", makes up what I call the essential Riker collection.",989193600,4,1330,4.963963963963964
