1916843,4,B0000CABAT,"If you're interested in this boxed set, then you probably are already familiar with the movies. Apart from Clint Eastwood's 'spaghetti westerns', the films in this package are amongst his best westerns. Made in three different decades, each film represents Clint Eastwood as the star and director in three different eras.

'The Outlaw Josey Wales' (1976) was Eastwood's last 70's western. In the film, Josey Wales makes his way west after the Civil War, determined to live a useful and helpful life. He joins up with a group of settlers who need the protection that a man as tough and experienced as he is can provide. Unfortunately, Josey is a wanted man and his past catches up with him.

'Pale Rider' (1985) was filmed after a 9 year western-hiatus and was his only 80's western. Here, a gold mining camp in the California foothills is besieged by a neighboring landowner intent on stealing their claims. A preacher (Eastwood) rides into camp and uses all of his powers of persuasion to convince the landowner to give up his attacks on the miners.

'Unforgiven' won critical acclaim in 1992 with four Oscars including best picture and his first best-directing gong. Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

The only drawback to this product is the package itself. Although the DVD's come in a box, they are not contained in the typical plastic DVD case with the original stand-alone DVD sleave. Instead, the original stand-alone sleave is printed on a cheaper cardboard DVD case which clips into a plastic backing. I was disappointed to receive this, so I'm just letting you know.",1146787200,24,2003,5.024096385542169

1916845,5,B0000CABAT,"This is a great 3-pack.  I always thought that Pale Rider was his best personal effort, but he got the Oscar for The Unforgiven.  Now you can compare the two, and you have The Outlaw Josey Wales to boot.  Eastwood built a Western filmography almost as great as the legend himself, John Wayne.  Eastwood always looked good in the saddle and his preternatural scowl fit the High Plains well, whether in early Italian/Spanish productions with Sergio Leone, or his later personal westerns.  He covers much of the same material, but his delivery gets ever better.  The Unforgiven has a deconstructionist feel to it with memorable performances by Gene Hackman and Richard Harris.  It was probably the most daring of his western movies, but Pale Rider has the greatest visual appeal, set against rugged backdrops that exude the romance of the Old West, like A.B. Guthrie's Big Sky novels. The Outlaw Josey Wales makes a good bridge between his early ""spaghetti"" westerns to his later big screen performances.",1081728000,40,1001,4.958083832335329

1916868,5,B0000CABAT,"I really like ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"" movie!!!  The ""Pale Rider"" is pretty good, just not quite as good as the Josie Wales movie, one which I know I will watch often!  Eastwood is always great, a good actor and a good director, unassuming and a real person, even in his movies.  I am a little disappointed in The Unforgiven.  It is dark and moody.  I will watch it again this weekend, as I was tired the first time I watched it, so maybe didn't 'get it.'  Eastwood's acting was wonderful, as usual, but the plot was ... as I already stated ... dark and moody.",1387324800,,560,4.235849056603773

1916883,5,B0000CABAT,Three great westerns from across Clint's career.  Clint may have got the Oscar for Unforgiven but Pale Rider is the much better movie in my opinion.  The Outlaw Josey Wales fits in somewhere between those two movies.  Check them out for yourself and see which you think deserves the award.,1317772800,,289,4.74
1916884,3,B0000CABAT,"Incomplete set, so they put  TWO  of same movie to complete a three dvd box set. THEY did refund part of moneny but  thats not the point.",1301097600,,137,4.0
1916885,4,B0000CABAT,"I have watched Pale Rider so many times, I've memorized the script. It is an Eastwood classic, in my opinion. and is one of my very favorites.
  Outlaw Josey Wales is without a doubt, my favorite of all of Eastwoods movies. The synopsis of the movie is a realistic view of the Union Army and their dirty miltary tactics, as well as life for the survivors, at the end of the Civil War. I have watched this movie over and over again, and never grow tired of it.
  I saw Unforgiven at the theatre, when it first came out. I was a little bit disappointed in it. It is O.K. but not my favorite in this set.
  I have enjoyed owning this set for action drama.",1221696000,2,652,4.134920634920635

1916887,5,B0000CABAT,"First off, I  could not believe that the only place which I was able to purchase The Outlaw Josie Wales was on Amazon!?  I say this because this is my absolute favorite Clint Eastwood movie.  When I first started looking for this movie I was quite astounded that it wasn't available anywhere else.  It was every bit as good as I remembered it to be.  Plus there was the added bonus of purchasing it in the Westener set which came with two other great Clint Eastwood movies (Pale Rider and Unforgiven).  The quotes are endless!
Overall a fantastic buy!",1212451200,2,551,4.515151515151516
1916888,5,B0000CABAT,"Eastwood shows us again why he is one of the worlds greatest directors.  If you are a more recent fan of Eastwood movies (Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River ect.) as i was, then you will love all three of these movies.
  Of the three, i prefer Unforgiven.  Its a damn masterpiece.  Josie Wales is Second which is one of the greatest westerns ever made.  And Pale Rider is good but it is defenitly the weakest of the three.",1206403200,,421,4.333333333333333
1916889,5,B0000CABAT,"I am thoroughly surprised by the generosity of this set. These are Clint Eastwood's best westerns! After viewing, I understood why the cinematography buffs felt disappointed. The Outlaw Josey Wales was a little grainy but the Unforgiven was clear and full. The cases for the CDs are very poor, but no worse than other CDs. This means that they must be stored carefully in a hard case.

Enjoy this set, I have. If this review was helpful please add your vote.",1203811200,2,458,4.654320987654321
1916890,5,B0000CABAT,"I was so elated to see that I was able to still find ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" on dvd. I had tried to find it in regular online dvd stores but apparently it had been discontinued. Sure enough when I got to Amazon, Bam! there it was and Good Times. One of Clint Eastwood best westerns in my opinion plus two of his others that were in other folks opinion fantastic too. It was a win, win situation. If you can still find the set available jump on it ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is just beyond excellent and the other 2 movies are very good too.",1203206400,,539,4.09433962264151
1916891,5,B0000CABAT,"I thoroughly enjoyed all three movies and seeing Clint get his revenge.  He's the fastest on the draw, straightest shooter, tough, and oh so smart.  These westerns are classics with the Unforgiven being unforgettable. His characters are dirty and sweaty.  You start to feel grimy if you watch them like I did.  One after the other.  The old west was depicted by Clint to be a tough place to live in and you had to have guts to survive.  Clint's character in all three movies, always chewing on a little cigar, never hesitated to gun a bad guy down, and you always felt that it was justified.  His bad guys were truly bad guys.  Hooray for Clint.",1203120000,,645,4.452991452991453

1916893,1,B0000CABAT,"The outlaw Josey Wales looks OK, but the other movies are copied very poorly.  The video is very dark.  So dark, most of the time the characters are silhouettes.  Don't buy it.

DVD quality: The Outlaw Josey Wales is top notch, excellent transfer.

Pale Rider & Unforgiven are very poor transfers, and I cannot recommend them in this regular DVD format. Not sure the reason behind this, but the transfers are really blurry and not up to the Outlaw Josey Wales.",1191196800,9,379,4.7272727272727275

1916900,5,B0000CABAT,"If you seriously have to read a review as to why this boxed set is so great than you are a lost cause. However, if you have been living in a cave or just got rescued from a deserted island after being gone for the last 30 years or so, than I guess your off the hook.

If you fall into the latter, than suffice it to say that 2 of these are the greatest Clint Eastwood movies of all time. ""Unforgiven"" itself transcends the western into something so fantastic that I don't have time here to list the reasons why. Just buy it!!!!!!",1169164800,4,529,4.086538461538462
