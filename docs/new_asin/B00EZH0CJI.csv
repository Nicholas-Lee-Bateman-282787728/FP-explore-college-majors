8610840,1,B00EZH0CJI,I had forgotten about all the things Ryan went through during this movie.  It is very exciting and truly holds my interest.,1425427200,,123,4.590909090909091
8610841,4,B00EZH0CJI,"THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was somewhat a disappointment to me. I can forgo any complaints about the casting of the main character. The story is the culprit here or the truncation of the story near the finale. This is actually a very engrossing film until the final third. The film titillates the viewer tediously divulging events and characters constructing a complex framework of suspense, paranoia and intrigue that ultimately delivers a devastating situation to the world's two superpowers. It is amazing that the scriptwriter, the director or both did not know how to culminate all these events into a climax equal to the impressive filmmaking up to that point. Throughout this film the villains seemed to hold great power and influence and were in absolute control of events that they were manipulating. In the final third of the film the rug gets pulled out from under them and the rest of us. The escalation of the US/Soviet conflict almost seemed superficial and hurt the the film. However, Jerry Goldsmith's score seemed to pull out some thoughtful reflective reactions on the Soviet side during this phase of the film. In all, SUM OF ALL FEARS has a frightful scenario and the villains are not who you think. Interesting stuff. Also there were great performances from Liev Schreiber, Morgan Freeman, Michael Byrne and Philip Baker Hall.",1418083200,,1341,4.964444444444444
8610842,5,B00EZH0CJI,"This is a tale of a young jack Ryan and how he became to be involved with the CIA. We also see how he met his wife. Soon we also see how he uses his negotiating skills to save the world from a nuclear attack and nails the bad guys.

I was surprised that the character of Jack Ryan was handled so well by Ben Affleck. Actually there are many great actors that are so believable and do not overwhelm their characters. Even though the whole story was great and well balanced, my favorite scene is the one where Jack has to explain to his girl that the reason he is not at their date location is because he is helping the CIA with a nuclear count in Russia. Jack says that he cannot tell her what he is doing. DCI William Cabot (Morgan Freeman) said to just ""go ahead and tell her the truth"" so Jack does tell the truth and his girl (Bridget Moynahan) hangs up in frustration and disbelief. William Cabot snickers. Morgan Freeman is just good at whatever he touches.

Moral of the story is cigarette vending machines can kill you.",1387756800,,1026,4.256410256410256
