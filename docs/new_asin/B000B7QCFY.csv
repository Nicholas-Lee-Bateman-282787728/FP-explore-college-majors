2407579,5,B000B7QCFY,"This movie tells you the real story about how Curtis Jackson made it.  It has the only interview I have ever seen with 50 Cent's grandfather talking about 50 when he was a kid.

The animations are pretty cool and the music is fresh.  The filmmakers combined a variety of different styles (animation, video, graphics, etc) to make a unique documentary.

This is NOT a big-budget hollywood story cuz it aint suppossed to be that.  If you want that go see Get Rich or Die Tryin and get the hollywood version that doesnt even match reality.  This dvd is the REAL story - not some fluffy actor version.  Alot of people on here are talking trash about the quality, etc.  But the whole point of this dvd is to tell the gritty story from the streets - not some studio suit's version.  Its FRESH.  Get it.",1135209600,6,796,4.390410958904109
2407580,5,B000B7QCFY,"Whether you are a die hard fan of 50 or simply a fan of music in general, this movie should not be missed.  Everything you wanted to know about rap music's hottest legend in the making you will find here.  This is the real deal as told by those that know him.  Even better than his movie!  The music is hot and the animation, fresh.  A must have...",1133481600,3,348,4.0588235294117645
2407581,5,B000B7QCFY,"This has a total hip hop vibe...the music is great and the story is real cool.  If you don't know about 50 this movie tells everything and does it with cool animation and music.  The guys who created this really thought about hip hop when they did this film, gritty and street this is a real hip hop music movie...straight up!!!!!!!!!!",1133136000,4,335,4.475409836065574
2407582,1,B000B7QCFY,This is a movie that somebody made to get rich off of 50 cent. This movie was horrible!!! Save your money and do not buy this. I am a die hard 50 cent fan and this was terrible. Just another scam to make money off a great entertainer!!!,1132358400,,236,3.9375
2407583,5,B000B7QCFY,"This is a great movie.  The filmmakers combine animations, interviews, and 50 Cent concert performance footage to tell the real story of how 50 blew up.  The graphics are so cool and every part of his life is covered.  And the whole movie is told from 50s point of view.  Also, the music in this dvd is some of the hottest new stuff out there.  Definitely a must have dvd if you dig 50 or Dr. Dre.

Besides the movie, they put in about twenty different bonus chapters like 3D animations, freestyle rapping, and 50 doing a photo shoot with G Unit.

This dvd has alot of cool stuff about 50 that didn't even get shown in his movie.  Get this dvd for the whole story.",1131580800,3,664,4.214285714285714

8083182,4,B000B7QCFY,"If you a REAL 50 fan you gonna love getting the inside story from 50 and interviews in this movie with his real family and friends, not no movie production hollywood version of 50's life. you get that mix tape - from the streets style - the real. for real just getting this movie for the soundtrack was worth it you get to hear REAL G-Unit street style flows on the soundtrack and it even got ricky ruckus on it. this buy was worth my time and $$$",1155081600,3,447,4.090909090909091
8083183,4,B000B7QCFY,"This is a fairly solid movie.  Obviously an independent - but it does reveal some new information and it is worth the money.

Now that 50 is coming out in a new movie this is a good one to ad to the collection.

8083184,5,B000B7QCFY,"All the haters need to listen here.  50 and his crew loved this dope.  If any of you guys in the sticks knew about hip hop you would have noticed that the g-unit music video ""My Buddy"" used a very similar animation and video style.  THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE.  Both that music vid and this movie reflect the real 50 Cent style.  Love it or hate it - its real and its the truth.  Thats why this style is now being used in all the new 50 videos as well as Eminem in his Mosh video.

All you haters need to break out of ya Top 40 mindset and dig the independent vibe and authentic flava.

So you girls quit ya namecallin and keep dreaming that you know sumtin bout flicks...cuz you DONT.

The reality is this flick has true 50 Cent FLAVOR.  Animations are in the same style as g-unit and also same style as Eminem used in the political music video MOSH.  Plenty of never before seen videos with 50, his gramps, and alot of other playas.  Dig it.

The soundtrack is all independent artists - which I happen to think is cool since thats the way fiddy made it - on the streets.  I watched this twice cuz I like it so much.  I am a successful music producer in Detroit, I having worked with Em and plenty of other rappers, and I'm telling you some of artists on this movie are about to blow up.

Overall these filmmakers made a pretty good movie - even though its obviously independent and not big budget.  It is an interesting and compelling documentary about life on the streets and how fiddy made it.  There is alot of cool information (some stuff even I had never heard) - and like I said, the music and animations are fresh.

I give this movie the following ratings (scale of 1 to 5):

Story: 5

Animations: 4

Music: 5

Editing: 4

Overall: 5

hope you all find this helpfuls.  later,

this movie is absolutely terrible. If you can handle more than ten minutes of it, you're a tougher man than me",1149897600,,270,4.4
8083186,1,B000B7QCFY,"I was channel surfing one night and I landed on 50 Cent: Refuse To Die.  At first, I thought it was an authorized production but I quickly began to realize that something wasn't right.  This so-called documentary is loaded with hip-hop jams but none of them are from Fitty or the G-Unit camp.  Also, the majority of the film features some of the crappiest animation I have ever seen.  There are informative interviews with Fitty's Grandfather, DMC, Treach, and DJ Skribble but the movie still has a generic feel to it.  I was glued to the film like someone watching a train-wreck.  I kept wondering why 50 even agreed to narrate this turd up until the credits started rolling.  The voice of 50 Cent was provided by an imposter named Leviticus Richardson.  He had me fooled, but boy was I pissed.  Remember all the bogus 2-Pac cds that hit the streets after he died?  Several wannabes had copied Pac's flow to the max and we were bombarded with Mackaveli pts 2 to 92.  Remember the Bruce Lee imitators?  This smells like the same doo-doo.  I'm not even a fan of today's hip-hop but I would love to hear what 50 and company have to say about this.  I was tricked but there is no need for you to get played.  Avoid this urine stained comic-book and watch Cartoon Network instead.",1149206400,3,1276,4.48695652173913
