8567993,3,B00BG4RN6S,"This collection of movies is supposed to treat us to several horror films. All things considered I wished I'd have bought only one of the movies. I loved Memory with Billy Zane who has such a great presences in a film in which he unknowingly hunts down a serial killer that he sees through their eyes. Salvage is a freaky stalker film that feels superlong despite its short length. Mortuary is a gross out horror with very weak TV actors. But for Memory, its a decent thriller. Skip the rest.",1421798400,,492,4.477777777777778
