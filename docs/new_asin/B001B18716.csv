3478228,5,B001B18716,"I was heading to Kuwait when this season started, so I only got to see the second episode before I left, and I was freaked out that Brad Chase was the A.D.A. now, Paul Lewiston was gone, and replaced by Carl Sack played by John Larroquette. So I honestly wasn't planning on buying this right away. But being over here, in the Army with nothing really to do except go to work, and pretend I'm not here, I picked it up. Well I really couldn't resist because William Shatner is my biggest hero, and I love the character of Denny Crane.

Watching this season from the beginning to end I realized this show was a lot better than I had expected, in fact better than season three, which kind of left me wanting a little bit more. Season Four brings back a lot of characters and stories from past seasons, more so from season two; witch is my favorite season over all.

I was going to give this set a four star, because a few of the episodes it was a little hard to suspend disbelief, like when Alan go to the U.S. Supreme Court, I find it hard to believe they wouldn't have shut Alan down when he just unloads on them. But I had to give it five stars, because even though some episodes are hard to believe, for the most part, it tries to be fair when it comes to both sides of the issues, more so than Fox news itself, which they even take shots at from time to time. That's cool for a show that's a Fox property. But more than that I found myself laughing so hard in some episodes, I completely forgot that I was in this bleak and desolate country and felt like I was back home in the states among friends.

It is sad that this next season is going to be short and last season, which surprises me because of all the praise and awards this show, has received over the years. But that falls on the suits at ABC, which they also take a few potshots at towards the end of this season. So one can only hope when they get to the Finale, they end it with a BANG.

So until next time...
DENNY CRANE, OVER AND OUT.",1222300800,24,1999,4.1179487179487175
3478229,5,B001B18716,I love this show and will be very sad to see it end this year. The relationship between Shatner and Spader is wonderful. My father was in big business and there are so many 'deja vu' moments during this show which makes it so real to me. I am in Orlando and my Aunt lived in Vancouver. We would both watch it and the following evening I would call her and we would talk about the show and laugh for hours. It was the best time of the week. I'll miss that but even more when the show is over. Shatner has proven that you can get away from a previous character (Star Trek) and be really damn funny. I look forward to watching it all over again in my 'older' age.,1221004800,17,660,4.007575757575758
3478230,3,B001B18716,"I own all 3 DVD sets of this show.  It's my favorite.  However, the production effort of season 4 has noticeably declined.  There are still some strong, funny moments, but they're fewer and farther between than in the 3rd season, and there isn't much in there to fill some gaps (Less music, maybe?). Comedic timing seems to be off a bit, camera angles less interesting, and makep makes everyone look too pale most of the time. The lack of Brad and Denise is very apparent, although the new people are interesting, but not particularly funny.
There's still some magic left, but it's obvious they're spending less on the show to produce, leaving me, the die-hard BL fan to long for the good old days.....Buy it if you're still hooked, but I'd start with an earlier season if you've never seen the show.",1219536000,25,800,4.619718309859155

3478232,5,B001B18716,"In my opinion this is one of the best seasons of Boston Legal. I am really disappointed however that the fifth will apparently be it's last.
Shatner continues to deliver a top notch character. One of the highlights of the season and in my opinion the best episode when Denny and Alan go before the Supreme Court, what an excellent episode!!
I am really looking forward to season 5 and rewatching the whole season from the start.",1213747200,48,428,4.571428571428571

3478373,5,B001B18716,"DAVID E. KELLEY has been THE  BEST writer in Hollywood; pure and simple.  Since the 70s  when his TV show, ""Picket Fences."" ran for SEVEN years and  WON every EMMY at least TWICE and some THEE times.  And then, in the 80s David stole TV again with  Ally McBeal.  No one in the WORLD missed an episode in the 1st season.  And, as if that wasn't enough glory for one person, then came Boston Legal.
I am a died in the wool Trekkie.  If someone had told me that Captain Kirks best days were way past Star Trek,  I would have told them they were crazy.  BUT then, on October 3, 2004, began a one HOUR comedy show. Hollywood had never tried a whole hour of comedy; wouldnt work.  And for FIVE years  Boston Legal  stayed at the TOP.  Not one episode missed ! ! !  And the CASTING  ! ! ! !  How did David so many actors from the top of Hollywood on the show.  It took me all of 15 minutes in the 1st episode to realize that William Shatner was going to be Great ! ! !
James Todd Spader I wasn't so sure about.  That SciFi movie he did ( StarGate ) I didn't care for.  But, by the end of the 1st episode, I was convinced that he was the right man for the job. Forgive casting director, I am, but, a lowly, dumb viewer. :-|
Candice Bergen was  Murphy Brown  for TEN years ! ! !  and America loved her.  She she won FIVE Emmy Awards for Best Actress in a TV Comedy ! ! ! !  John Larroquette, for his role in TVs Night Court in the 80s,  won a then-unprecedented FOUR CONSECUTIVE Emmy Awards ! ! ! !  Night Court  ran for 8 years.  ALL these great, comedic actors and David E. Kelleys genius, sharp witted writing created  5 years  of

He remains a smooth pitbull, but has gradually become an underdog, usually for the wrong side of a liberal argument.  The writing is superb, there's a rapid turnover in second lead characters, lots of sexual innuendo and stuff not so subtle, and don't even ask about the midget.  The cases reflect major conflicts of the time, a Denny Crane (William Shatner) keeps sticking his foot in his mouth). .Shatner can actually act and proves he deserved the Oscar (but, really, here's the headline, the Shat can act!).  I never saw this in first run and can't wait to get through all five seasons, then will undoutedly watch them again.  This is great stuff.",1401494400,,733,4.74015748031496

They attack the hypocrisy of the American election system, rather than just the Republicans. The series has always stood up for the individual against the system / big business / whatever, and continues to do so.

I found it as entertaining as the three previous series.

I also found the following quote in Simon Schama's ""Dead Certainties"" -
from the New York Sunday Morning News of 1850:

""Abraham Oakley Hall found the trial ""unmistakably Bostonian"" in its complacent contempt for hard evidence and its preference for melodrama over due process.""

The more things change...",1314921600,,781,5.166666666666667
3478606,4,B001B18716,"This was election year, so the series would have even more advertisements to vote Democrat and shun those thoughtless Republicans (as represented by strawman Denny Crane). But the stories were really working this season, no matter how outlandish the lawsuits.

Watching this season on DVD helped me and my family accurately predict the 'not guilty' outcome of the Casey Anthony trial on television. We had watched too much Boston Legal to believe the prosecutors had made their case in that real life trial. Alan Shore educated us on the concept of 'reasonable doubt'. You can't beat that sort of education from a fictional show.

Prescience is something of an art, as I noted in previous seasons, this show missed the mark predicting that electing a Democrat president would get rid of Guantanamo Bay detentions, domestic wiretapping, and wasteful foreign wars. Oops!

But in this season's ""Glow in the Dark"", Alan Shore does something remarkable. In arguing against the building of a new nuclear power plant, Alan gives an off-the-cuff warning of the danger of earthquakes and nuclear power plants. This was original aired in February 2008. Imagine the lives saved if this show had been a hit in Japan these past few years. (At least Japan's power companies might have been pressured to make the plants sturdier in case of earthquakes.)

While Boston Legal always strove to stay on topic with the day's headlines (such as when Denny Crane accidentally 'taps his foot' to another man in a courthouse bathroom in the episode 'Oral Contracts'), it often ends up being timeless for future viewers. In that, the show is a continued success.",1311465600,,1637,5.007352941176471

3478646,2,B001B18716,"Boston Legal definitely jumped the shark in Season 3 after the first brilliant season, and continues the decline in Season 4. Almost everything smart in the show has been replaced with absurdity. The show always had plenty of absurdity, but the balance between the craziness and the half-plausible was measured and not completely lopsided. Seasons 3 and 4 are just plain ridiculous fantasy. No shred of suspension of disbelief remains possible.

The acting is still good, although the cheap, mugging, maudlin moments greatly outweigh any true opportunities for the actors to show their craft.

Boston Legal, had it developed just a wee bit more seriously and avoided turning into a mere political soapbox, could have been one of the greatest TV shows ever. James Spader's character could have easily risen into the pantheon of great television lawyers. Alas, since the decision was made to turn the show into a complete circus instead of 50/50, we will never know what could have been here.",1283817600,5,990,5.067484662576687

3478651,4,B001B18716,"Okay, I take back everything I said about the previous season -- this one rocks! The main characters are brought into sharper relief with some better stories that revolve around better things than plastic love dolls and the like. The interplay between the new female staff (Katie, Lorraine, Whitney) is most intriguing. Denny Crane gets trapped in one ridiculous situation after another and Jerry Espenson shows us ever deeper dimensions of his neurotic brilliance, but most assuredly we are laughing with them and not at them. Yes, you don't have to be young and/or body beautiful to have a good time on this show, and get as much action as your heart desires (although sometimes it doesn't hurt, heh heh).

All the unmitigated pomposity that permeates our most revered cultural institutions is mercilessly skewered here, and even the United States Supreme Court cannot escape! Perhaps my one criticism is that we don't always get the most satisfactory explanation as to how Denny and Alan manage to win some of the more preposterous cases (I mean, sometimes it seems just a bit too easy) and, in the event that they were to actually lose, would they be moping rather than celebrating at the closing scene? Hold on-- come to think of it, in one case, the judge became so annoyed by an apparently frivolous lawsuit that he had them both locked up in a jail cell!

I think this show really begins to hit its stride here in terms of good stories and character development, and feel most regretful that it was eventually cancelled!",1270598400,,1528,4.806083650190114

I have got to say, somehow the writers pull it off and make it funny and relevant.  I love the real-time jokes about up-to-date political happenings, and the cascading group of characters this show brings in is amazing.  My only complaint is that they bring in some fantastic characters that don't last long, but their long-standing regulars are amazing in this season.  The newest main character, Carl, is a fantastic addition to this series.  The fun story lines in this one include a trip to New Orleans (imagine Denny in New Orleans), and a fight against the Government after finding out that Denny was mistakenly put on the no-fly list.  If you have loved the series so far, you will love this one.

Enjoy!

The characters are stunted and uninteresting.  It was as if the writing staff completely ""mailed it in"".  Allan went from one of the great tv characters to a neutered version of his former self.  There are a few good moments in the courtroom for Allan, but his character is a shadow of the brilliant presence he created during the prior three seasons. Don't even get me started on what they did to Jerry!  Shatner, Spader and Bergen are still great, but the writing is dull and stupid.  Avoid this season!

3478669,1,B001B18716,"Bost Legal used to be my favorite TV series with it's perfect blend of wit, drama, and humor.  Over the first three seasons the show just gets better and better with each episode.  What the hell happened!?  If you have watched and loved the first three seasons then please heed my advice...STOP.  The new cast is un-intersting and does not gel.  Jerry Epenson pretty much takes over the show this season; nearly half of almost every episode is dedicated to his trials and new, compulsive ""conditions"" that seem to come from nowhere.  The show still tries to focus on Alan and Denny but even they grow tiresome in this season.  Alan has become one long political rant and although I agree with most of the ""politics"" in this show; that is NOT why I watch a TV series.  And Denny...how many times can he be arrested for solicitation and shooting somebody before it's not funny anymore.  And now, they don't even have an interesting supporting cast to keep things entertaining around the office.  The most important thing that this season loses is the humor; it begins to take itself too serious but completely fails as a drama.  This season was so bad that I did not bother to watch the final season.

So I say again...if you loved the first three seasons as much as I did you should spare yourself before this season taints your memories of what Boston Legal was and should have continued to be.",1257292800,12,1394,4.576612903225806

3478700,5,B001B18716,"Boston Legal is a show that was always outlandish in nature. Putting together a phenomenal cast into original situations. With the fourth season ready to go it looked like it was time to stir things up.

Out of nowhere a new face enters the front in the form of the distinguished and off beat humorous John Laroquette. Carl Sack is the new hall monitor of Crane Poole & Schmidt and he is here to make these hallowed halls look like a real law firm. Well, it looks like Denny Crane and Alan Shore will have something to say about it. This season is not as light hearted as the seasons of this show in the past. This season brought a lot more depth to the friendships of these characters. Denny and Alan's friendship gets as heartfelt as it can be because Alan and all those around him are noticing that Denny's altzheimers is starting to take slight yet noticeable effects. Alan suddenly starts to conquer many of his fears from clowns to extremly aggresive ex-girlfriends. Even Jerry has become a major part of this family, not as someone who is getting into trouble, but as a true dignified laywer.

This show has yet to disappoint me, but now unfortunatly this show has ended in 2009. There is one more season for us to enjoy, but for now this 4th season is one to be savored.",1238025600,,1278,4.43404255319149
3478701,3,B001B18716,"From the peak of the successful season's two and three (or the first half of it anyway) we enter a VERY different looking offices of Crain, Poole and Schmitt.  In fact you could very well think that the show has been taken over by the liberal left...And sadly, it has.

The usual wizzbanger of a season beginning case is found wanting with new headmaster, Carl Sakk landing on the firm like a sledge hammer.  Intimidating Clarence Bell, Jerry Espenson, and newbee Kate Hedges, John Larocquet soon settles in as the inforcer.  However he has very little influence on Allen and Denny who soon turn into bumbling sideshows espousing their opposing political agendas that we are familiar with.
A surprise character, Lorrane, played by British actor Saffron Burrows is more for show than substance, mainly to keep Allen Shore amused. Shirley is still snooping around the corridors reminding everyone that she IS the main named partner.  With only token apperances by Paul Lewiston, and Brad Chase, it's such a shame that the 'hitmaker' characters are no longer relavent.

Sadly the lead (Shore) is a shadow of his former self, more into ranting about the Bush Administration and the American way of life derailing. He finally getting a real nemisis in the return of Melvin Palmer, who tells everyone that Allen, can ""fire and shoot a breeze at the same time"". Brought back by popular demand, he will make an apperance in season five leaving Allan Shore speechless. A mid-western or Texas spin off with Melvin Palmer would be a real hoot! However too little too late.

It would have been nice to see a visit by Edwin Poole, Donny Crain and the much talked about return of Tara Wilson, none of which have made a reapperance.

I saw it coming in the third season, but I didn't  thought  that it will hit him so hard. All his speeches were like editorials. I miss Boston Legal's past quality  that confronted both sides of political views, like  the fights between pals Denny Crane and Alan about issues like gun control, or death penalty, to me those funny confrontations were more political effective than all the recents pontified speechs of Alan; and I miss characters  like Brad and Denisse, who were obviously not the cup ot tea of liberal Alan, but  were likable to most viewers and made Crane, Poole & Smith a more believable  law firm  that  the nut house that Carl is trying to put in order.
From this season I enjoyed Carl, he is a great character. And I loved Kathy, she's the nicest lawyer of Crane, Poole & Smith, but so intelligent at the same time.  An Shirley, as always, is the best.

The wackiness was still there, and the pointed topics were still as sharp as ever.  The Supreme Court episode was so clearly the manifestation of what David E. Kelley would like to say to the Court if he ever had the chance - which was pretty much what I would like to say to the Court. Outrageous, but right on target, like so many of B.L.'s episodes.  I am constantly amazed at how William Shatner's character is developing over time, and Shatner's acting is wonderful.  He says more with his facial expressions than many actors can say with their voices. He's come a long way from Star Trek days. While there have been some great woman characters on the show, IMO there still hasn't been a woman character who stands equal to Denny Crane or Alan Shore.

All worthy subjects, but for me not one I want to engage in seriously with show that I usually watch to escape the real world.

What can I say, otherwise than at the start now they have gotten rid of Mark Valley, Julie Bowen, Rene Auberjonois, and Constance Zimmer. While the first three had been on for a while and were very valuable secondary characters, Constance Zimmer was spectacular in Season 3. This is simply not logical. Also the new secondary cast members are not up to the same quality. These changes were also a problem with Ally McBeal back in the day where cast members also disappeared. Anyway, otherwise the writing and acting is of course superb. William Shatner is in top form as Denny Crane and the show is areally about him and this alone makes it worth your while.

There were a number of good episodes, few great and a lot of ok ones.

Still worth buying, but just not with the same vigor (ie, wait for a sale)",1224201600,3,524,4.262626262626263
3478792,2,B001B18716,"This season was a marked departure from the first two seasons and even last season. The first two seasons were hilariously funny at times. Alan Shore's eloguent humor in his lecherous pursuits was reason enough to enjoy the series. The extremely clever dry wit of Shirley Schmidt added further to the show. Denny Crane's comic relief and yet being crazy like a fox rounded out a superb cast. Season four had none of these fine characterisations. Instead this show was little more than a showpiece for David Kelley's liberal left wing views. Almost every episode had some virtually over the top, preachy message to deliver. Alan Shore was a shill for every liberal issue that is before us today. Shirley had none of the warm and fuzzy gentle humor that was her forte in earlier seasons. There was not so much as a shred of balance to the show. Season four was an incorrigably flagrant message bearer of the Hollywood liberal elite. At times, some of the episodes were down right annoying in its espousing of frivolous litigation to showcase fashionable views of the democratic party.",1223424000,5,1082,4.82258064516129
