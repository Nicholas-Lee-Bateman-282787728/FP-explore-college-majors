2560644,1,B000FC2G5K,"The plot is very simplistic in that it's about giant bugs terrorizing a sorority house full of girls.  If you are a fan of switching your brain off, it's probably best to do that before viewing this movie anyway, and watching cheesy fun, then you'll probably like this movie.  The CGI is incredibly bad, and I mean very bad.  I don't expect CGI in a movie like this to be on par with a Star Wars film, but I do expect it to be good enough that it doesn't detract from the movie.  The CGI in this film made me wince every time a giant bug showed up.  The acting is okay, but most of the movie is played to achieve a high cheese factor, which it excels at doing.  The end death sequence in the pool is probably the worst death sequence I've ever seen.  I really hate to call movies like this horror films, because they are not.  They are played for laughs and have nothing at all to do with horrifying the audience.  There is no depth, there is no horror, and there is little reason to watch this movie, unless you are into movies with cheesy plots, acting, and effects.",1160179200,5,1068,4.196078431372549
2560645,5,B000FC2G5K,"In a sorority house, a brilliant nerd girl accidentally creates some giant insects, they get away and start killing her gorgeous, incredibly sexy, barely dressed sorority sisters.  If you liked movies like Sorority House Massacre II - Nighty Nightmare, you'll enjoy this.  It's pure cheesy fun.  All the girls either get topless or else run around in a bikini.  A hot Asian babe gets all sweaty doing her martial arts workout, and and incredibly hot lesbian babe spends the whole movie running around in a see-through T-shirt with a black bra underneath and enough cleavage sticking out to make your eyes pop right out of your head.  The plot is fun, as these incredibly silly looking CGI bugs chase the girls around and pick them off one by one.

I absolutely loved it.  If you're looking for a serious horror movie, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something cheesy, really, really sexy and very much in the tradition of a fun '80s slasher (except with really bad CGI bugs), this should be just what you're after.",1157760000,10,1021,4.761363636363637
8120751,4,B000FC2G5K,Lol! I liked this! Wish the bugs looked more real though. Like watching 3D with no glasses. Maybe it was 3D? Lol!,1524960000,,113,4.181818181818182

8120754,4,B000FC2G5K,"Cheesy and sleazy, reminiscent of the mindless fun of Full Moon pics in the 80's. Megan Heffern is an exceptionally cute and spunky lead. Shame the creature CGI is so mind-numbingly bad, but you can't have everything.",1508630400,,217,4.891891891891892
8120755,3,B000FC2G5K,"Reminds me of the ""big bug"" movies of the 50's/60's (somewhat). Story line was tooooooooo tripe for my taste. The acting was below par.
But I did stick it out until the end which is more than I can say for some of the other movies on the site.

Watch it and see if your favorite BIG BUG made it into the movie.",1485388800,,310,3.9206349206349205
8120756,4,B000FC2G5K,"This is a fun cheesy film. Creepy Cami (Meghan Heffern) experiments with insects in her sorority house. Her older sister (Samantha McLeod) is in the sorority too. Her bug experiment is disrupted by Josi (Rhonda Dent) a fun role playing babe who doesn't like her performance interrupted by loose experiments. Needless to say the bugs get big and smart.

The bug graphics leave much to be desired, but were part of the fun. Josi had the best part and lines. There are girls putting each other down and a few token horny guys. Plenty of sex and nudity but not Samantha McLeod.

8120759,3,B000FC2G5K,"This is one of those delightfull throw back monster movies. In the 50s,no matter how dopey the situation or how unbelievable the special effects,the cast was professional and played it straight. They sold the movie. Now,as often seems to happen,these independant companies have the skill to create good monsters. But they lack the forsight or tallent pool to get a decent script,or professional cast.
  So you get a plot as thin as paper full of disposable charecters being eaten by great looking monsters. I am easily entertained,and a serious student of special effects. So the giant insects are the selling point for me. But this flic is not a classic. I like it. But I have no illusions as to why. It is just a fun monster movie. Thats all.

  Might as well face it,I'm addicted monsters, John F.",1228176000,,800,4.726618705035971
8120760,2,B000FC2G5K,"INSECTICIDAL is one of those cheesy bad movies that is ALMOST bad enough to be campy, but it's really a pretty bad movie.

The story revolves around a nerdish female student, Cami, whose experiments with bugs to support her thesis goes awry.  She asserts that prehistoric insects were bigger and smarter than men; when her snooty sorority mate, Josie, kills all of Cami's specimens, she unknowingly causes them to grow bigger and meaner.

The movie's budget shows, and the CGI effects are pretty lame, but there are moments when the cheesiness shines through and INSECTICIDAL almost becomes enjoyable.  For fans of giant bug movies, though, you get big spiders, beetles, slugs, scorpions and a big praying mantis with the bluest eyes since Paul Newman.

Worth a rental on a snowy night.",1163980800,3,786,4.969465648854962
