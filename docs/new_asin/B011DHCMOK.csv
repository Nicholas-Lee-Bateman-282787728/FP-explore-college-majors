8724122,5,B011DHCMOK,Fessenden is an incredible director who is highly underrated and these four films are great examples of independent film-making at it's best. You can tell that he has a great love for the genre and is innovative enough to turn low budget films into priceless works of art.,1520726400,,272,4.6875

8724125,3,B011DHCMOK,"Larry Fessenden.....who?
Unsure why this director is receiving a collection Blu Ray set.  Just maybe its just me and my jaded tastes but I feel his work is mediocre at best.  Nothing groundbreaking here.  Hipsters seem to elevate Larry's work beyond it's level.  Maybe hipsters are aliens bent on some sort of world takeover scheme?  Either way, there is waay more interesting film to stumble across.
Thanks for the Blu Ray releases nonetheless.",1438387200,7,445,5.041095890410959
