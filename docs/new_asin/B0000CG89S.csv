7999452,5,B0000CG89S,"Sometime in 2004 I was watching my local PBS station on a Sunday night, when Soundstage came on with Russel Crowe and his band, 40 Odd Foot Grunts. At least, I think I have their name right. Anyway, long story short, I wasn't too impressed. Another case where an actor tries to be a rock star, or vice-versa. Their performance was simply unremarkable (Russel, if you're reading this, please don't come to Springfield, IL to take a swing at me!).

So then there's Kevin Bacon. Actor, dancer (yuk-yuk), and he also has a band? Hmmmmm, memories of the aforementioned Soundstage episode came surging back. ""Despite the reviews I've read on Amazon, should I purchase this DVD?""

There were a few things that helped me make the decision to buy it: I've always been a fringe Kevin Bacon fan. Add to this, I'm a big fan of acoustic guitars, knew that Michael Bacon had a top-40 hit a few years ago (read: an able musician was involved), had read everyone else's review here, and -- having a notable, music, DVD collection already -- decided to splurge and give the Bacon Brothers a shot. My one word review goes like this: ""Wow!""

Without giving a rundown, song by song (I didn't know any of their original tunes beforehand), I'm just going to give my general reaction to this show. It is very, very entertaining. I must admit I enjoyed Kevin's voice, engaging lyrics, and -- believe it or not -- musical talent the most. He even plays the 12-string (no small feat ... even for guitar players). Don't get me wrong, Michael is supremely talented, too, but Kevin was a real treat to watch on stage. Very relaxed and funny, yet intensely focused on the task at hand. You can tell these guys have been playing most of their lives. Given the contributions of their live group, combined with the guys (and girls) who normally only contribute in the studio, the Bacon Brothers' stage was filled with about 7 or 8 gifted musicians. What a blast! And the Everley (sp?) Brother's (with only Kevin and Michael on stage) medley was so dead-on ... well, you'll just have to see it. I will certainly enjoy watching this more then once!

All told, if you are on the edge whether to buy this DVD or not, my advice is to order it today!",1106524800,13,2211,4.533834586466165
7999453,5,B0000CG89S,"I have to say, when I purchased this DVD two reviews had been written and they weren't favorable.  They complained about sound quality but there is nothing wrong with the sound on my copy.  I was one to always rely on my own interpretations and opinions so I bought the DVD anyway and...I'm so glad I did!  It was pure Bacon Brothers at their finest and if it hadn't snowed that day I would have been in that audience!  I live about an hour north of Englewood and we had more snow, so for me to make it would have been a miracle.  I did get to see them about one and a half years prior to that day at a WHUD Summer Concert at Croton-on-Hudson park and this DVD took me back to that wonderful place.  It was fun, light hearted and just great music. If you are a fan or even think you could be a fan, this is the DVD for you.  Michael and Kevin sing and play their best and it was just as I remember at the park that day.  Harmony was perfect and Michael's chello in ""Sooner or Later"" had me mezmorized.  The slow ballads kept me entranced while the light and bouncy tunes had me chair dancing.  I always smile when I see this DVD and I've watched it three times within two weeks so far!  Guaranteed to make you smile!",1082246400,11,1216,4.067226890756302
