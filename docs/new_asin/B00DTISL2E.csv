8597564,4,B00DTISL2E,"This is an excellent Arab comedy from the '50s.  The supporting cast is wonderful - Zainat Sedqi and Mary Mounib - and the script has a lot to it. The only reason why there aren't 5 stars is that the quality of the DVD image (the transfer is good, the orginal stock had some scratches that come through) varies a bit and some of the special effects are off.",1419552000,,357,4.173913043478261
