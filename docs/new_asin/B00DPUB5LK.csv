Its hard to take anything he says seriously when he didn't even bother to check wikipedia about what he is talking about.  The production is very dry, he is a terrible narrator, the things about the atrocities are interesting andI don't doubt they happened but its hard to take his journalism seriously since he said he had to go to an ""obscure' 2003 document to discover what JSOC was and otherwise its an incredible secret.

5846854,4,B00DPUB5LK,"""Yet we seemingly tolerate a rising level of violence that ignores our common humanity and our claims to civilization alike. We calmly accept newspaper reports of civilian slaughter in far-off lands."" Robert F Kennedy

Although it seems America may be pulling out of Afghanistan next year, Special Operations units have been steadily and secretly increasing their deployments around the rest of the world in places like Yemen and Somalia. These ""pinpoint"" operations merely obfuscate the military's footprint and are thus a PR coup for the DOD but a disaster for public accountability. Consequently, today's wars are being fought in our name in foreign lands completely under the public radar. In light of recent revelations regarding the government's massive domestic surveillance program and the DOJ's record amount of prosecutions against whistleblowers, one might reasonably argue that this is the least transparent administration in our nation's history. The Obama administration's attempts to sanitize war by shrouding it behind a cloak of government secrecy ultimately serve to keep American citizens in the dark about what is really going on. War is by nature dirty, however, and it is the very knowledge that war comes with huge costs and sacrifices that acts as a check on our aggressive impulses. By bringing the hidden truths about these military night raids and drone strikes into the light, ""Dirty Wars"" makes a compelling argument about why you should care that we have been a nation at perpetual war since 9/11.

Originally, the film was supposed to focus solely on the story of the buildup of JSOC itself, but the filmmakers made a good decision to expand the scope of the documentary to include more about the man who helped to expose the story. Jeremy Scahill, a sedulous investigative reporter for The Nation magazine, is an interesting figure who stands apart in today's age of feckless news media and the increasingly moribund state of investigative journalism.

The most powerful aspect of the film is the way it humanizes the victims of American violence by giving us faces, names, and stories to connect with the dead. The term ""collateral damage"" is a military euphemism for civilian casualties. In the newspapers that report on these Special Operations night raids and drone strikes, which have been happening with increasing frequency the last few years, we are only told the number of dead. Even worse, we are told that all military age males who are killed in drone strikes, whether they were intended targets or not, are automatically categorized as militants. In a particularly lame performance of spin doctoring, a DoD spokesperson rationalizes the deaths of pregnant women and children by reassuring us that they COULD have been militants.

To those who respond, ""Well this is war. This is what happens in war,"" the film poses an important question: What is the ultimate end goal of all this bloodshed? What have we accomplished in our last 10+ years at war if it has only engendered more enemies around the globe. In the film, it would be comic if it weren't so tragic when a former intelligence officer states that what started out as a kill list of 50 names at the beginning of the war has now become several thousands.

The film succeeds in presenting complex issues without moralizing, and finds the right balance between veracity and entertainment. The movie does seem to stretch and play up material sometimes for unnecessary film noir-ish effect. The changing nature of warfare is a compelling story even without the stylistic frills. But the film's greatest achievement is how it raises important questions about who we are and where we are headed as a nation.",1379376000,64,3703,5.073891625615763
5846855,1,B00DPUB5LK,"I don't, so much.  Adversaries in wars have names for people like Jeremy Scahill, they call them useful idiots.  And Scahill is one useful idiot.  He is also full of it, claiming that he'd never heard of JSOC, the Joint Special Operations Command.  Some military reporter he must be.

I could go on, but if you are seeking a movie about special forces and their amazing work, and you believe in our US military, spend your money elsewhere.  Instead, if you would like to read a scathing and devastating point by point demolition of this movie, read Douglas Valentine's review, ""Dirty Wars and Self Indulgence.""  You will know all you need to know about this movie.

Finally, I should say this.  On 9-11 and for some years afterwards, the American military was fighting an asymmetric war.  More recently, thanks to our special forces it seems the US has learned to apply a little symmetry.

5846857,5,B00DPUB5LK,This award winning book and film are thought provoking and should be a first choice for anyone interested in the truth about America's current foreign policy and drone wars.

It points out how these policies continue to enraged millions around the world and strengthened the hand of America's enemies. It uncovers what many would consider war crimes. Jeremy Shahill is a fearless impartial national treasure and a dying bred of journalist who still seeks to get to the bottom of a story and reveal the truth no matter how culturally unpopular it may end up being.

5846859,4,B00DPUB5LK,"...as opposed to Clean Wars?

This documentary submitted by the USA to the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival is directed by Richard Rowley and is based on investigative reporting by Jeremy Scahill, a reporter for The Nation. This expos centers around an organization known as JSAC, which conducts top secret missions at the behest of the President of the United States. JSAC has existed for almost ten years but has enjoyed unprecedented fame with the capture and death of Osama bin Laden. Joint Special Operations Command answers to no military agency, not the CIA, not the United Nations, nor Congress.

Jeremy Scahill first came on the international journalistic radar as the author of Blackwater, an expos of the hidden world of America's covert wars being conducted by contractors, not the American military. Scahill stumbled into bits and pieces of JSAC and quickly drew fire from the military and from the lap dogs who pretend to be television newscasters. That was how he knew he had hit a nerve.

Scahill says this organization claims to work harder and faster and the resulting collateral damage inflicted on civilians is uniformly denied by the powers that be. (1,700 night raids were conducted in Afghanistan in a single week.) The President has operatives in numerous countries now, many of which are considered allies of this country. An edict has been issued to assassinate an American citizen for being a terrorist, which is drawing fire from many groups, including the ACLU.

According to Scahill, we seem to be trying to kill our way to victory, although each time we kill ten terrorists, another hundred appear to take their place. This organization is hidden in plain sight and no end is in sight.

This documentary is thought provoking, capably photographed and is narrated by Scahill himself. Get it from Amazon (release date 10-15-13) and judge for yourself.",1374192000,25,1888,5.057877813504823

5846881,1,B00DPUB5LK,"A silly piece of American ""journalistic"" buffoonery which has more to do with the ""reporter"" than the ""story"" being reported. Needless to say, this is par-for-the-course in American ""free media"" entertainment circles, but for anyone interested in education, analysis or insight this item is a complete waste of time and money.

All American ""journalism"" is a form of fiction; but this particular ""movie"" is fiction with the author as the ""hero"". In Hollywood parlance, this would be called a ""vehicle"" for the """"star"". But for History students, who know how Hollywood ""frames"" American imperialism, this piece of self-pimping ""journalism"" will come across as what it is: shallow, self-serving drivel. If you are someone with an eye for America's hegemonic peccadilloes you'll see that even those who profess to be ""against"" it [as in this instance Jeremy Scahill]  actually practice it themselves ~ So, this ""investigative"" movie will help you make that point to those who don't understand; but it has no other merits beyond that.

""America"" all about Self-Promotion and Big Bucks and in this childish production, Jeremy Scahill shows how to do both while claiming to ""chases down the hidden truth behind America's covert wars."" [even though those ""wars"" are not ""covert""  and there is no ""hidden truth"" behind them.

5846902,1,B00DPUB5LK,"I think Scahill has cojones as big as basketballs. He's twice the man I am, going places on his own I wouldn't without the 82nd Airborne Division alongside.

That said, his ""documentary"" is a perfect lesson in presenting only one side of a story. The side that makes the soul feel good. The side that causes a sense of justice to rise in the throat. The side that wants to protect small children, pregnant wives, abused villagers.

But it's not both sides.

For example, the film spends much time deploring the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, on the direction of President Obama. It is indeed a serious question, a moral and constitutional one, but a question the film does not explore. Instead we get Awlaki's sympathetic father. We get many minutes on Awlaki's teenage son, killed in another drone strike two weeks later. Not mentioned, that I heard, was that the young man was in the company of eight others and was certainly not the intended target.

Most important, we hear nothing about the Fort Hood coward, Nidal Malik Hasan. ""...intelligence agencies intercepted at least 18 e-mails between him and al-Awlaki.""

We hear nothing about Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Christmas Day Underwear Bomber, with ""...concrete evidence that al-Awlaki was Abdulmutallab's recruiter and one of his trainers, and met with him prior to the attack.""

We hear nothing about Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square Bomber, who ""said he was moved to action, at least in part, by al-Awlaki's English-language writings calling for holy war against Western targets, and he was a 'fan and follower' of al-Awlaki.""

Quotes are from the Wikipedia page on Awlaki, where more examples of Awlaki's influence and control can be found. Are they enough to justify the execution of an American who has not been tried? Hard question. I wish it didn't have to come to that. But I have faith our leaders thought this through. That side of the equation is not presented in the film.

As to the sad killings of the villagers in Gardez, it was indeed tragic. But anyone who knows anything about combat knows the term ""fog of war."" No country, not Britain, not Israel, not America, no country can do everything right in war. It's never been possible, and even less now when the enemy often hides among innocent civilians. No country's military is entirely made of know-all, see-all saints and demigods. Mistakes happen throughout life (ever misplace your keys, snap at your spouse?). When lives are in danger, when bullets are flying, bombs exploding, then even more so.

But not in this film.

Not mentioned once in this film is that the killings of innocents by our forces is unintentional and rare and lamented, while the killings of innocents by Islamists is deliberate and common and celebrated.

Again, Scahill (and his photographer) is one brave SOB. I'll grant that he's smart, too, even if he couldn't figure out how to search for JSOC in Google.

Regrettably, he's produced a film that tugs at heart strings instead of informing us about an important weapon in the worldwide war against Islamic terrorism.

He had an important story, but didn't tell it. He let his emotions get in the way of the story. Maybe he let himself get in the way of the story, with his face on screen far too much. A missed opportunity for him. A lesson in propaganda for the rest of us.",1412899200,15,3352,4.808695652173913

5846940,3,B00DPUB5LK,"very sad documentary which tells the story of some of America's undeclared and/or covert operations in middle eastern and african countries. felt the story was told well enough, thought the music was alittle over-emotional. in my opinion, the reporter suggests that the president is operating a hit squad out of the white house. I think he provided enough evidence to suggest there may be some truth to that. my takeaway is, though I love people, I'm grateful we're restricted to this one planet, which we are in the process of ruining for most life on it. given the destructive model we seem determined to follow on our one and only home, our exploration into space would be a nightmare for any life we found that was less powerful than us. we've been around as homo sapien sapiens for 50,000 years scientists say, and we've been warring for who knows how long, yet we seem to have learned little more than how to murder more ruthlessly (no mercy, an african man says here), and abit of technology, which we tout as examples of our intelligence. after 50,000 years it's reasonable to assume that we don't have the mental capacity and will to develop into a highly principled and highly ethical species; a pity, as we do have some intelligence. But not enough. I think we're out of time, and that the earth will deal with us. The real tragedy is so many other life forms have been harmed and continue to be harmed by us, because we have the brawn but not the brains, to steward this magnificent planet. Can you imagine a species being given heaven and pissing it all away. That's the story we're currently living. This film shows one aspect of our wrongheadedness. Three and a half stars.

P.S. I have a theory, which I hope is wrong. After dominant governments have largely neutralized people who criticize them, oppose them or point out their wrongdoings, and after the surviving world citizens see that it is unsafe to stand up for their rights; after wealthy and powerful governments buy up large swaths of fertile land in dirt poor countries, or just steal assets outright, as in the case of richer countries illegally trawling off the coasts of poor african countries; after countries that can, position themselves politically to the best of their abilities (America is our friend), then we'll see affordable fossil fuels, the lifeblood of wealthy countries, begin to wane. I theorize that the more proactive governments will ""encourage"" their old, their sick, and their poor to die. Old and sick in wealthier families will survive. I believe some governments will also take the opportunity to marginalize their more undesirable minorities. Undesirables who are willing or able to work in the fields will be allowed to live, as all societies require manual and farm laborers, but the sun, which is getting hotter as it ages, will take a horrible toll on those laborers, as will the heating effect of green house gases which envelope our already warming planet like an electric blanket. The criminal class will continue to thrive due to bribery and corruption. State run health care will give governments access to medical records, and they will abuse that access. Laws like the Patriot Act essentially strip protections from U.S. citizens, and in America the laws most citizens believe they enjoy protecting them from the state have been circumvented by new, anti-terrorist laws. Most senators and U.S. Representatives are attorneys. I predict that America of 2100 will be unrecognizable as a democracy but will still be a world power due to it's military; I read that half of all tax dollars go to the military and security agencies. I follow the Post Carbon Institute and their Fellows, Richard Heinberg and David Hughes, who say that affordable fossil fuels, which are the life blood of world economies, are on the way out. We'll always have oil, but it will be increasingly expensive, and as oil is used in the creation of just about everything, everything will become increasingly expensive. If you want to learn more search on Youtube for David Hughes talk at Cornel in 2012, The Energy Sustainability Dilemma. That talk is also on the Post Carbon Institute website.

5846960,1,B00DPUB5LK,"I've always been a big fan of shows like PBS's Frontline, that does a good job of objectively presenting both sides of an argument.  I just found myself shaking my head watching this one-sided, hyper-sensationalized explanation of JSOC by a 'reporter' that filmed the doc like he is the Jason Bourne of documentary filmmakers.  First, to infer that JSOC is so super-secret that it took Scahill exhausting work to uncover what they do makes him either stupid or a liar.  Ask any 13-year-old kid who plays Call of Duty, Battlefield and/or SOCOM and they could have educated him about the organization.  To say that their Commander, McRaven was some super-secret and protected warlord, again, makes him stupid, a lair or a person that has never picked up a book about the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Let's talk about facts.  Scahill sure puts a lot of reliance on the truthfulness of some questionable characters.  If the basis of your facts come from interviews with Somali Warlords, Tribal Elders whose alliances change as fast as the faction that controls their province, disgruntled former-JSOC operators that refuse to let their identity be known and/or Afghan government officials, you might have to consider that you are getting a very narrow view to a complex story.  I don't remember seeing a single explanation from a single US Military representative in the entire documentary.  I kept waiting for it.

I think that anyone already having anti-American military ideals will enjoy the movie and nod their heads in the affirmative for the hour and a half this doc plays.  If you are very pro-military, it will just make you sick.  If you are somewhere in the middle and watch this objectively, I think you will come away asking, ""OK, but what's the other side to this story?""",1389312000,22,1782,4.883720930232558
5846961,4,B00DPUB5LK,"I recently viewed Dirty Wars from a source other than Amazon. The documentary was very good. I found a number of things disturbing, but I do know sometimes, in order to catch the wolf, you have to become the wolf. There are so many issues that can't really be addressed using traditional warfare models. The USA and it's allies have made a paradigm shift in how certain aspects of warfare are prosecuted. Asymmetrical warfare has become the norm with front lines being almost non-existent and every part of the theater has potential for actually being a combat zone. The situations remain fluid and can morph into a full on fight with no warning.

There are times when it is necessary to do distasteful things in order accomplish the necessary missions. Although i hesitate to use the quote, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one"". So many people are like sheep. They don't want to know about anything unseemly and they expect life to just move along. They don't believe anyone is bad and they do not believe people are out there to do them harm, for what ever the reason.
The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The difference, though, is that the sheepdog must not, cannot and will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheepdog who intentionally harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The world cannot work any other way, at least not in a representative democracy or a republic such as ours.

Still, the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer that he didn't tell them where to go, or give them traffic tickets, or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the sheepdog cash in his fangs, spray paint himself white, and go, Baa.

Scahill by reviewing Anwar's story in detail, he shows why people like Anwar became terrorists?

Also I will admit I consider Jeremy Scahill one of the most inspirational American Citizens and Courageous Journalists on the planet. He will point out that the local Arab journalists who actually broke parts of this story, deserve the credit, which proves my point.

This insightful, considerate and thoughtful film carefully analyzes the costs (Exorbitant) and benefits  (slim to none) of our ""war on terror"" which is a travesty for everyone involved. Nothing is worth our young men coming home to commit suicide because the veterans affairs denies their requests for PTSD benefits, after witnessing, or participating, in War Crimes, but that is not covered in this film. Or on Fox.

What this film illustrates, is the lies and omissions by both Obama and Bush, as well as their subordinates, JSOC and the DOD. It clearly examines  the costs to both our troops and primarily to the majority of  civilians around the world, and our credibility as a nation of ""good guys"". This movie explores both a complex series of ""wars"" and exposes the travesty of the ""War on Terror"" Which has made America into a Rouge terrorist state, as Noam Chompsky has pointed out in interviews with the film maker on Democracy Now! Which is well worth watching for free, if you doubt my opinion as a film or foreign relations critic (as well you may).

We are not making any friends and are worsening our Foreign Relations disastrously, only to benefit a few arms merchants, who are the only life form below oil companies, and bankers IMHO. Urge your representative to have the U.S. join the ban on land mines and cluster bombs, they are the weapons of Sadists & war criminals. As bad or worse than white phosphorous or VX (nerve) Gas.

It's also useful for it's truncated examination of the support we give to people that far more deserve to be in jail than the avenge american. And most interestingly examines how America seemingly chose to pursue a disasters ""War"" on a ""Tactic"" (Terrorism), Rather than pursue a useful, moral and defensible, police action against a few dangerous and insane criminals.

5846972,5,B00DPUB5LK,"This documentary is about Americas expanding hidden wars against terrorists under the previous and current president. I had heard about drone strikes, targeted assassinations, and kill lists - the topic is not new to me. But if the film wasn't based on the reporting done by well-known and well-respected journalist Jeremy Scahill, I would have a hard time believing some of this.

Scahill exposes the underground connections during the decade between 9/11 and the killing of Osama bin Laden, neatly filling in gaps in the public knowledge. While Scahill doesn't outright condemn President Obama, he does make it clear that Obama is a ruthless commander that considers the entire world fair game to hunt suspected terrorists - even if he has to kill people illegally in other countries. Scahill makes a really plausible case that America creates new terrorists by killing the old ones - and Obama knows this.

The only thing that kind of pulled me out of the film is that it is presented in a kind of melodramatic way, like it is an action spy movie and Scahill is the hero. The story is enough of a spy thriller on its own - it doesn't need to be enhanced. But that is a relatively minor complaint for one of the most important films of the year.

There are some fairly graphic scenes that may disturb some viewers. But if you are interested in politics, war, or the nature of terrorism, you need to see the film. It is a chilling detective story, an emotional bomb, and a rare conspiracy theory that is actually true.",1387324800,5,1519,4.681647940074907
5846973,5,B00DPUB5LK,"The good thing about a horror film that scares you is that, once the movie is finished, you know it is over and you can sleep well knowing it is not real.  The sad fact about Dirty Wars is that it scares you and you know, once the movie is over, is that what is shown in the movie is continuing to happen all over the world.  In fact, it is expanding.

This most frightening event the movie touches upon is the assassination of Anwar Al-Awlaki.  He was a US citizen who never received a trial.  All the government had to do was state that he was a terrorist and that was it.  When asked by journalists for evidence, the Obama administration refused to cooperate.  Then, for some unknown reason, his son was killed as well.

By doing what they did, the Obama administration has given precedent to a footprint which allows our government to murder US citizens without trial.  This opens the door for a massive abuse of power against all of us.  What if tomorrow a union leader, who is a tough negotiator is considered terrorist #1 by the government because the corporations he negotiates against have made large donations to the political party in power?  All the government has to do is send out its minions in the media, call the guy terrorist #1, and boom.  They do not need a trial.  All they had to do was try the case in the media.  That is what they did with Al-Awlaki.

But what is most disturbing is how massive and uncontrollable our military has become.  It really is so large that it has, basically, become its own separate nation from the United States' civilian government.  This movie discussed, in great length, JSOC, an assassination team funded by our tax dollars.  Even when they make mistakes and kill the wrong person or persons, they are not held accountable for their actions.

It is unfortunate the direction our country has gone since 9/11,  We have allowed the government to continually abuse its power by using the War on Terror as an excuse.  Seeing how Al-Awlaki was killed and how JSOC operates, who knows where this slippery slope will lead.

I saw the film first, but I definitely will be buying the book.  I give this important documentary five stars.  It gives the viewer an introduction into a world that is not discussed in detail by the mainstream media.",1386979200,7,2289,4.540342298288508
5846974,1,B00DPUB5LK,"I don't even know where to start with this review. I am sure small minded individuals will have a hard time believing that I am a liberal Democrat, but I am also an avid war history buff. The first time I heard mention of the Joint Special Operations Command was on the news in 1993 after the incident in Mogadishu known widely as the Black Hawk Down incident.. it was again in the mainstream news in December 2001 during the Battle of Tora Bora when the JSOC went into Afghanistan to look for Bin Laden. In 2008, there was a detailed account on the New York Times best seller list called ""Kill Bin Laden"" all about the JSOC operations in Afghanistan during the Battle of Tora Bora. JSOC again made world headlines in 2011 when Bin Laden was killed by Seal Team Six.. who are widely known as part of JSOC. How anyone can stand up with a serious face and call themselves a war journalist who had never heard of the Joint Special Operations Command before he ""exposed"" them in 2013 is an insult to the integrity of every honest war journalist.

To break down a couple of other absurd points he brings up in his documentary while talking to Taliban with an obvious political agenda.. JSOC, while part of the US military is not part of the conventional military. NATO forces would not have any need to know about what they are doing for a number of reasons. Their missions are highly sensitive and need a very high degree of operational security. It is a well documented and widespread problem of Islamic extremists infiltrating the Afghan National Army. One village elder in the documentary shows his sons various certifications and asks how they could possibly think he was Taliban. It's an extremely common occurrence to have a trusted member of the Afghan National Army turn out to be a spy. That is not something new to this conflict either.

The part that made me laugh the hardest was the accusation that the Black Ops soldiers would take the time to dig out their bullets of any dead body. Bullets don't just stop when they hit a body, they don't imbed themselves neatly right where they entered the skin. A bullet can travel right through the body, they break up and fragment, hit bones and end up in strange places. If JSOC's presence anywhere in Afghanistan were somehow illegal, (It isn't) and the mission was clandestine in nature, (Sometimes they are in other places) the operators would use sterile weapons to hide the fact they had been there. They would use a weapon ubiquitous to the region, the AK74 for example so that when they find shell casings it can't be traced back to their country of origin. That's much easier, less time consuming and more effective than mutilating dead bodies trying to recover unrecognizable hunks of metal.

If you want a documentary to paint the US government as one giant conspiracy trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes while they slaughter enough innocent babies to satiate the blood lust of everyone who visits Bohemian Grove, this is perfect for you. If you're however interested in the reality that is JSOC or the climate of the war in Afghanistan here are some better recommendations.

Kill Bin Laden, Dalton Fury, a first hand account by an actual member of JSOC. There is no political agenda, just the facts as he saw them. There is plenty in the book to make the administration and the military look bad if that's what you're looking for.

Not a Good Day to Die, Sean Naylor- again JSOC in Afghanistan during the Operation Anaconda, very objective piece as well.

Outlaw Platoon -Sean Parnell, while not JSOC, Parnell was on the ground, without a political agenda the book covers the climate of the war, and there's quite a bit about the infiltration of the enemy into the ranks of the Afghan National Army.

Lions of Kandahar - Not JSOC but a good memoir about Special Forces in Afghanistan

The Only Thing Worth Dying For.. The story of JSOC and SOCCOM as they get Afghan president Hamid Karzai out of tribal Pakistan and elected president.

Task Force Black- JSOC and their joint task force inside Iraq as they raid high value individuals.

5846986,3,B00DPUB5LK,"I really enjoyed Dirty Wars, and thought it was spot on with the analysis that JSOC (US Special Ops) has turned into a killing machine.  I know at least in the areas of the world where I work (Africa and Europe), the US's overaggressive and poorly thought out counterterrorist efforts are making the terror threat worse, examples being Libya, Mali, and soon to be Nigeria.  I guess that is the point of Dirty Wars, war is business, and CT wars are good business--they take on a life of their own and are profitable so much that everyone is on the payroll and unwilling or unable to stop the killing.

So why only three stars for this film, by far, there was too much airtime for Jeremy Scahill, the author of the book and narrator of this film.  During Dirty Wars, I thought of the film Apocalypse Now, where at the beginning of the movie Martin Scheen was in a dingy hotel room waiting for his assignment.  He is agonizing, and going a bit crazy in his room, and then kicks in a mirror and cuts his hand, and comes back to a certain reality.  Scheen then breaks out of his morose state and the movie then begins Sheen's journey to capture/kill Colonel Kurtz.  Well Jeremy Scahill in this entire film never leaves the hotel room.  The film is one long close-up of Mr. Scahill who is eternally agonizing, with numerous Scheen hotel room dialogues in a low monotone voice. How many close-ups can you have of a journalist?  Dirty Wars would have made more sense and done a much better job by not focusing all the attention on Mr. Scahill.  At the end of the film, I was a bit sick of looking at Mr. Scahill.  Anyway, I still don't know why it took Mr. Scahill so long to figure out what JSOC did in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I ask why he really didn't develop a more precise link between the White House and JSOC?  President Obama is probably one of the few recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize to have such a long ""kill list"". Why is the US President authorizing so many JSOC operations and killings in the name of democracy and peace?

5846992,5,B00DPUB5LK,"I read the book months before I watched this film. So I had some idea what I would see. Still, it was deeply troubling to look into the eyes, and hear the voices, of old men, widows, and children whose sons, daughters, husbands, fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers were killed for no good reason by we Americans in our demonic lust to 'kill the evildoers'.

We do not care how many civilians we slaughter in order to get one Anwar Al-walaki. If there is one message from this film, that is it.

Our rationale is that it is okay to kill innocents to get to those who have sworn to kill us. We do not care how many innocents whose deaths we cause. Nor do we care that those who have sworn to kill us are quite openly, and honestly, and certainly justifiably, telling us why they are committed to kill us --- it is because we spanned earth and sea to kill their mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, sisters, and brothers.

It does not even matter to us [and surely even the least intellectually inclined among us must have figured this out] that we are creating multiple terrorists for every one we 'neutralize'.

It does not matter because we are demons and demons kill. That is our job and we do it well. Our bought and paid for warlord from Somalia articulated it well in the film. We Americans are war masters. We are great teachers.

We kill. And we span earth and sea to find, fund, and arm other killers like us.

The Christ spoke of us. ""Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.""

So ... we will not stop. Films like this certainly will not stop us because, once you wade past all of our 'fighting for freedom and democracy' B.S., the inescapable truth is simply this:

We Like To Kill Innocent People For No Good Reason.

So ... we will kill, and kill, and kill again, and again, and again until God Itself finally puts an end to our wickedness.

5846993,4,B00DPUB5LK,"In Jeremy Scahill's new film a Somalia WarLord financed by the US to interrogate and kill suspected terrorists considered America, a War Master, a great educator in the art of War and killing. Not what we had in mind for the US's PR, is it?

""Dirty Wars"" is Jeremy Scahill's book and film that investigates American strikes that killed civilians with no ties to terrorist groups, beginning with a raid in Afghanistan, that killed several members of a family. An Afghan police chief, taught and financed in the ways of War by the US and three women, two of whom were pregnant, were among the dead. This one series of killings by bearded men from the US, flown in at night and striking wherever they want, leads to many more such strikes. They are all denied and kept secret until a BBC journalist provides evidence. What we learn is that these killings of innocents that are adding up to the thousands , may be radicalizing Muslims. The American cleric-turned-Qaeda, Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by drones in September 2011, was put on the kill list. No capture nor charges, nor judge or jury, only assassination. Mr. Scahill said. ""We are making more new enemies than we are killing actual terrorists.""

We have long heard of secret, covert groups of military who answer only to the President, who kill and assassinate, capture and torture, but now we are doing this with our own Americans. The secret group is called JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command. JSOC's mission, is identifying and destroying terrorists and terror cells worldwide. Personnel are often exchanged between JSOC and CIA. By the early 1980s, CIA and military veterans were running counter-insurgency and counter-terror ops worldwide. General Paul Gorman, who commanded U.S. forces in Central America in the mid-1980s, defined this advanced form of Dirty War as ""a form of warfare repugnant to Americans, a conflict which involves innocents, in which non-combatant casualties may be an explicitobject.""

JSOC now operates in over 70 countries, killing thousands, many of them innocents. Drones are flying in many countries. Is this how we want our country to operate? Jeremy Scahill has also been an outspoken critic of President Obama. He disapproves of what the administration's efforts to ""normalize and legitimize"" targeted assassinations -- drone-executed and otherwise -- Special Operations raids and other covert military practices that blur the battle lines of the war on terrorism.

This is a very thought provoking film, filled with interviews from informants and those who cannot give their names. Today, there was a raid in Yemen, and it was associated with JSOC. Frightening, what have we wrought.

5846994,5,B00DPUB5LK,"This documentary is invaluable. It is a wake up call for those who think the American government is showing its true face to the people. It hasn't been for a long while now and still doesn't want you to know its secrets. They have us brainwashed thinking we have an enemy that they must protect us from. But the government itself is creating an enemy so vast that when push come to shove we will pay the consequences for their actions.

Jeremy Scahill's documentary sheds a light on the other face of foreign policy. Some say he's not revealing anything new, or it's about Scahill himself. It's not about Scahill. It's an investigative endeavor following Scahill along the way. Some accuse him of being a terrorist sympathizer and question what side he is on. My answer is, he is on the side of humanity where he should be.

If I have not heard of JSOC and you have not heard of JSOC, or raids on village people far and wide sent out by our government, then it is important to see a documentary such as this.

5846995,5,B00DPUB5LK,"Dirty Wars the book is an encyclopedic (though compellingly readable) history of America's abandonment of her own purported values in pursuit of an endless, borderless war against a tactic.  Dirty Wars the movie is both an excellent summary of and supplement to that story.  My only quibble is that the filmmakers decided to include the portion ""Breaking Out of the Green Zone"" as an extra rather than including it in the film itself.  It's essential viewing for anyone concerned about independent journalism, and if you watch the DVD, take a few minutes to watch the extras -- it's well worth it.

My thoughts on the book: ""Like Jane Mayer's The Dark Side, but much broader in its basis and scope, Dirty Wars is the most thorough and authoritative history I've read yet of the causes and consequences of America's post 9/11 conflation of war and national security.  I know of no other journalist who could have written it:  For over a decade, Scahill has visited the war zones, overt and covert; interviewed the soldiers, spooks, jihadists, and victims; and seen with his own eyes the fruits of America's bipartisan war fever.  He risked his life many times over to write this book, and the result is a masterpiece of insight, journalism, and true patriotism.  Read it.""",1382486400,35,1271,4.851851851851852
5846996,5,B00DPUB5LK,"The last time America won a war was when Japan surrendered in 1945, right?  From Korea to the twin debacles of Afghanistan and Iraq, the good old U.S.A. has looked like Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson in the final couple of fights of his career, a once fearsome competitor now inept.

But, wait!  Why not declare war on poor people?  You know, the ones living in tents in the desert - they won't be hard to vanquish.  Every time an American drone strikes one, even if it wasn't the guy for whom you were aiming you can declare victory.  U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!  Women and children blown to bits by Bush and now Obama?  U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!  An American citizen and his 15-year old child, smithereens?  U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!

Can Obama be so naive to not know that we create terrorists when we kill these children?

Our president is a liar and is as bad as Bush was, which is the exact opposite as he ran for president as.
This is all so shameful.

For the first time all the leftists are supporting a war and all the conservatives are against war.  Everything is so political and no one cares about these innocent people.",1382227200,13,604,4.454545454545454
5846998,1,B00DPUB5LK,"I started out with such great anticipation when I heard about this documentary. I was thoroughly disappointed. I was hoping to learn something I did know before. It turned out to be more about Jeremy Scahill then anything else. He emphasized his prowess in being a investigative reporter more then the subjects he was reporting on. I found it hard to believe he never heard of JSOC in his decade plus being a war journalist. He also makes it seem he was the one who discovered it, even though it had a wiki page. He takes the word of terrorists, warlords and anyone else of shady character over anyone from our government's. He seems to dismiss that they too could have ulterior motives and might be making up or embellishing certain facts for their own reasons. He makes certain people to be just victims of the war on terror like, Anwar al-Awlaki, when even he can't be so naive to think he was not radicalized before he went to Yemen. Also, he makes JSOC out to be an out of control entity that no one can control. This is debatable at best. It's the ideas that leaders like, al-Awlaki  and Bin Laden put into the mind's of uneducated poor Muslims that creates more terrorists, a lot more then any drone strike.

I do however like how he gives the people who have died form our actions a face and humanity. And debating on if we can kill an American citizen without due process is extremely important. But the good gets drowned in a pool of self indulgence and Scahill's ego.",1382054400,13,1478,4.470370370370371

8596191,4,B00DPUB5LK,"This was an interesting documentary, based on the US wars in Iraq & Afghanistan. I believe the story starts with the author's perspective in 2007. His primary human interest initially is a remote village raided by US Special Forces at night, which resulted in the deaths of male adults along with innocent women and children, caught up in a crossfire. Scahill digs deep into the family's story of a young man who was a local police commander, married with children, who was shot and killed by US Special Ops soldiers. It leads him to Washington, Yemen and Iraq and he eventually finds out about the US Special Operations Command, which hunts bad guys in many countries worldwide. This 'War on Terror' unfortunately results in innocent civilian deaths, which is bound to happen. ""Dirty Wars"" is an expose of US Special Ops, primarily under then-President Barrack Obama, hunting and killing suspected terrorists, terrorist masterminds, Taliban or Al Qaeda members.

It is a compelling documentary, well-researched and a story well told, but it is obvious the author disagrees with the US policy of hunting bad guys with either local warlords, special ops troops or drone strikes. This worldwide hunt for terrorists can obviously lead to innocent collateral deaths, and this is what Scahill focuses on. He actually gains access to members of Congress, former military special forces operators, and even families who lost loved ones to US military-led attacks in their villages. He also interviews the Father of US-born cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki, who joined the Jihad against the West and preached the gospel to his followers in the US and Yemen. He was actually killed in a US drone strike in 2011.

Overall, an interesting documentary and a different perspective from a disillusioned journalist who disagrees with his country's response to terrorism and it's collateral damage when innocent civilian bystanders lose their lives. I do recommend this, but suggest there is a different perspective on night raids and terrorist-hunting by special ops, which often result in completing their mission---killing terrorists targeting US troops or US targets.",1498262400,,2145,5.232558139534884
8596192,1,B00DPUB5LK,"Very first story told by the Afghans about was obvious BS from the time one of the villagers claims ""if they do this again we will attack them with suicide vests"".  If you lived in a village and it was attacked during a raid and 4 people were killed 2 of which were female and pregnant would you not fight?  Would you not tell the story with some emotion such as despair, anger, sorrow or all three?

They show 3 ""patched"" bullet holes in the wall as evidence of a raid where 4 people are shot.  Never in my career have I seen a raid where only 3 bullets went astray.  And apparently 4 people were killed.  The doorway where 2 of the victims were shot would be peppered.  It was little thick when both female victims both happened to be pregnant.  Two of the victims just happened to die at the same time that morning 7 am I think it was.  And because they were neither allowed to leave for aid or receive medical aid by the supposed Americans.  The kicker was That the American soldiers dug the bullets out with their knives before they left.  Think about that.  What good would it do to dig out bullets?  Why would you?

We have whats called a blue force tracker on all our vehicles that shows where we are and where we've been.  Removing the bullets would be an aweful task in the first place.  It's not like it would hide the wounds made by our weapons. Our rounds are 5.56 that's quite small.  It's only 223 thousandths of an inch wide.  We use FMJ rounds that don't mushroom or create some massive hole like a ballistic tip or a HPBT.  just digging out bullets wouldn't hide a thing.  If we did use a 240 LMG during the raid which is 7.62 x 51 there would be a lot more damage to the walls.  If we wanted to hide the fact that we killed them why not fly them off and dump them over a river or out in the desert?

During this whole story being told which is obvious propaganda the so called journo is there eating it up in sheer ignorance.  Or hoping like hell to get a scoop.  Knowing it's BS and that loads of ignorant individuals here are going to eat it up as truth.  The whole show lost credibility in my opinion at that point and became propaganda.",1496707200,,2159,4.169491525423729
