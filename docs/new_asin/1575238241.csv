7798897,3,1575238241,"Since there aren't very many documentaries on Mae West, one of the truly racy figures of the 1930s, it is easy to be drawn to this one. However, it has many flaws aside from being simply mediocre.

West began on the stage but made her way into films when she penned a controversial play called ""Sex."" The popularity of the play led her to films where she had a hand in the dialogue that went into them. Of course, things had to be toned down substantially, but West lured men with her ample body without shame. Her career lasted decades though she is most associated with the 1930s. She even made a screen appearance into old age.

The film clips used for this documentary aren't in the best shape. Also, not enough of the unknown parts of West's life are explored, so we hardly get an idea of who the woman was, only of what she did.",1165190400,,834,4.305732484076433
