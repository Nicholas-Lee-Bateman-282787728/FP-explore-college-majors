2200620,1,B00075E24S,"My Senegal is about a year and a half old and she enjoys listening to relaxation CD's with bird's chirping & singing in the background. So I purchased the bird sitter DVD for her listening and viewing enjoyment. She seemed uncomfortable at first but after several minutes became agitated, concerned, scared! I turned it off after about 15 to 20 minutes because she became increasingly more disturbed eventually becoming completely out of control, screaming and making sounds I have never heard her make before. Several days have passed and she is still not quite back to her sweet little self, buyer beware!",1212019200,6,607,4.96078431372549
2200621,5,B00075E24S,"My African Grey absolutely loves this dvd. When I hear about people who don't know what to do about their bored, loney, screeching bird I love to tell them to get this to entertain them.  I wish i could give it 10 stars. They should put out additonal versions.",1210550400,,260,4.3061224489795915
2200622,5,B00075E24S,"This video keeps my African Grey and Sun Conure entertained throughout the day.  I find it most interesting to see their reactions when a bird of their own species is own the screen.  I leave the natural sounds on for the birds during the day, but I like the fact that there are other music tracks.  There are also previews of other ""sitter"" videos for dogs, cats, and people too.  Overall, a very good product.  I wish I had purchased it earlier.",1205366400,3,447,4.402439024390244
2200623,4,B00075E24S,"This is an interesting concept of bird sitting in that it shows birds

interacting socially in a avairy or other open environment. My African Grey parrot is interested and animated when watching this DVD.The DVD offers options of natural sound or various forms of music..my bird really likes this as he tires of the same thing over and over. This gives him the

variety he craves.

An excellent idea well done!",1173657600,3,410,4.746478873239437
2200624,5,B00075E24S,"Our Moluccan Cockatoo loves this DVD! I would have never believed that a parrot would actually watch a DVD if I hadn't seen it for myself. Not only is this DVD entertaining, but it also stimulates our Parrot mentally, physically and vocally. I recommend this DVD for all bird owners, but especially to those of us that are `one' bird households.",1169769600,8,345,4.672131147540983
2200625,5,B00075E24S,"Excellent product. Hours of entertaining fun for us and our birds.

Our eight parrots love the sights and sounds of hundreds of parrots enjoying everday life in a flock.

We set up the bird's tv with the loop setting for the them to have on in the background.",1133049600,13,259,4.375
2200626,5,B00075E24S,"I thought this would  entertain my conures and in fact it does my conures react to some of the sounds. The down side is their scream few times. But oh well, they are conures and the loud ones so it is part of their nature to be loud.
You can tell the video and sounds call their attention and they became 'part of the flock' talking and screaming together with the parrots in the video.
For sure your parrot won't feel lonely but I noticed few of the sounds on the dvd kind of scared the birds, but they got used to that after a while.
The DVD has an option just to play the musics, also another option to play a video showing several parrots (all kind) making sounds. You even hear for few seconds the cell phone ringing (yes, it's not a highly professional video, but the important is that it works).
You also can set to run the video over and over. But I don't think is a good idea to leave playing more than 1-2 hours and everyday, it's good to give a break to the bird. But this is just my opinion because I keep imaging somebody locking me in a room and playing a movie over and over.
If you have to provided different toys and rotate them periodically so you not let him bored, I don't think this would be different with this dvd.
I also bought a music CD for bird at iTunes and also a music CD for dogs. Even being for dogs it works on my birds because the music is calm and played on the piano.
I imported the bird sitter dvd into my iTunes and I shuffle the sounds of this dvd with the music of the two CDs I bought. It works perfect.",1346457600,4,1544,4.045751633986928
2200627,3,B00075E24S,"The idea behind this video was a good one, and my conure was very interested in the birds on the T.V. screen (especially the big green ones that are grooming eachother).  However, my issue with this DVD was that there were several screaming birds in the background of some of the movie clips (the portions filmed in what looked like a bird store).  I've spent months working on training my conure not to scream.  The day after my bird sat there attentively watching this DVD and hearing other parrots scream, he spent the entire day screaming.  So, he did learn from this DVD; he did see ""natural"" bird behaviors (which is what I was hoping for), but I do not like that this DVD taught him that is is ""OK"" to scream.",1336953600,,716,4.401515151515151
2200628,4,B00075E24S,"Fast service, seems to be a responsible company which I appreciate. Price was ok but a little high  for what you get, but  considering what you get for your money nowadays I guess it was a pretty average deal. In good shape no complaints really. Would order from them again.",1326499200,,274,4.46
2200629,4,B00075E24S,Molly and I like the DVD very much< I have also learned more ways to keep olly happy. I would buy another one if they have a newer video.,1319673600,,137,3.7586206896551726
2200630,5,B00075E24S,"After losing our cockatiel that had been with our rose-breasted cockatoo Mozart for his entire life, we wanted to get him something to keep him company when we weren't at home.  I purchased this DVD for him and he knows when I'm going to play it and sits in the appropriate place on his cage so that he can see it on my laptop.  He talks to it, laughs, and whistles and thoroughly enjoys watching it.  I highly recommend this product, it is truly a ""Bird Sitter"".",1318550400,2,463,4.2988505747126435
2200631,5,B00075E24S,"To the reviewers that talked about preening and un-stimulating material... what DVD were you watching?

The loop was very stimulating. Our Caique loves it. He talks to the birds on the screen who are eating, foraging, having disputes and coming to resolutions, interacting with one another and just generally being active birds. There's really not one bird sitting and doing nothing or preening at all. They are all engaged in active behaviors.

My conure doesn't react as strongly as my caique but she doesn't seem frightened or bothered by it. While the caique chatters and interacts with the video, the conure seems to mostly ignore it. However, I still count it as a success overall just to supply them with the sounds of a flock environment.

There are some other options on the DVD to note, like the ""babies"" section. You get to see baby birds being fed and cared for. It's adorable for anyone who likes seeing naked baby birds being fed. You can choose several different musical soundtracks for the loop, such as jazz, new age and several other music backgrounds instead of just the bird noise. Interesting if the bird noise bothers you. There is a lot of explanation and insight by the fellow who developed this DVD, which I enjoyed and found to be very educational, though my other half (a voice professional) dislikes his style, saying he pauses too much. It's very obvious that he's not a professional speaker, but it is also obvious he's an avian professional, which I think is more important. The information he gives you is great if you don't mind his delivery. I don't mind it at all and found it quite enlightening.

I have zero complaints and the joy it brings my caique proves to me it works.",1306022400,,1710,4.709030100334449
2200632,5,B00075E24S,"I have an Amazon Parrot and live in an apartment. On weekends I like to get up and have coffee and be on my computer for a couple of hours. During this time I pop in the Bird Sitter DVD and my parrot happily plays and watches the DVD, sometimes talking to the other birds. He becomes especially animated when the baby birds are being handfed, or birds of his own species come on the screen.",1282953600,,390,4.144736842105263
2200633,2,B00075E24S,"My birds find this boring! All the footage is of bored birds kept in captivity. They don't forage, they're not playing in trees, and the majority of them sit and preen, that's dull! I find myself asking why this is getting good reviews, and my conclusion is that it mostly provides soothing background noise. FYI people; when a bird is alone in a quiet room they are bound to become antsy. Flocks are almost never quiet, when it does get quiet it's either 1. Nap time, or 2. A predator is nearby. You will get the same results of calm by playing nice background music from a radio, that's cheaper than a $20 DVD of bored birds.

But if you think your bird will benefit from a visual stimulus, then there are still better programs out there. The World Parrot Trust has spectacular footage of wild parrots from all over the world, the birds sing, dance, forage, chew, fly etc. instead of just preening! They just came out with another edition featuring South American parrots, it is breathtaking and fully captivating. Plus the profits go to saving parrots from extinction, what's better than that when you buy a DVD?",1252627200,22,1115,4.603015075376884
2200634,4,B00075E24S,"just bought the video for my two budgies and they've got mixed opinions. My one budgie seems to find the video quite relaxing throughout and will spend his time watching, preening, and talking to the birds on the DVD. the other one finds the bigger birds such as the macaw and cockatoo pretty frightening and will try to hide behind his buddy when they show up on the screen. I find the ""babies"" video on this DVD to be the best fit for both my birds (until of course the macaws appear) but i think each bird owner will have to see what works for their birds. I would recommend it to any bird owner to try out.",1249948800,,610,4.177966101694915
2200635,4,B00075E24S,"This DVD is simple... it has images of multiple species of parrots, either interacting with each other, or with a human.  It has several different options for soundtrack choices- from music to natural parrot noises.  It can be placed on a loop and played all day if you want.
Let me be up front, I would have never chosen this DVD.  Someone made it available at our veterinary clinic, and the results won me over.  I'm not saying it's a miracle, but it does seem to provide some sort of entertainment or stimulation for the birds.
As an example, during a boarding stay, an African Grey just couldn't seem to 'relax'.  By relax I mean, the bird sat and shivered in a corner of its cage all day long.  We tried her in several different areas; quiet, noisy, alone, surrounded by other birds, surrounded just by other African Greys... all to no avail.  In desperation, we put this DVD on a portable player for her.  Lo and behold, observable differences in her behavior within 10 minutes.  She started eating, engaging with toys and verbally responding to activities around her.
The DVD also seemed to stimulate increased activity and vocalization in a young male budgie as well.  Distinct differences in his activity level, seemingly dependent upon the DVD playing or not.
Who knew???  Totally worthwhile as a $20.00 entertainment experiment for your birds.",1224720000,,1354,4.793103448275862

8044797,1,B00075E24S,"This is just a bunch of screaming birds on tape....while there is a large collection of pretty birds here on film, anyone who owns a bird knows they will pick up what they hear. Unless you want your bird to start screeching constantly, don't leave this running for them.  We let our bird ""talk"" with the other talking birds on YouTube. It's free and you can easily select what they see and get to repeat.",1489017600,,404,4.386666666666667
8044798,2,B00075E24S,"Bird pictures are cute , but none of my birds enjoyed it in fact my Amazon and African turned their backs and seemed bothered by it , my umbrella just stared screaming. I guess it was worth a try , they would rather watch cartoons :)  or listen to rain Forrest sounds they really enjoy both . 2 stars just because my birds didn't care for it .",1476835200,,343,4.044117647058823

8044801,5,B00075E24S,"At first I wasn't sure about this dvd, It's in MPEG-2 format, so it was really hard to find a dvd player that would even play it. :( Once we finally found one, the intro was very helpful. It explained that birds may be afraid of the new sounds at first and recommends watching it with your bird at a fairly low volume the first time through to see how they react. Now whenever we have to leave him home, we turn on his portable dvd player we keep by his cage and play the ""loop"" chapter. By the time it gets to the second group of birds he's chirping right along with them. It reminds me of a child watching their favorite cartoon characters. He definitely has his favorite parts;even when he's doing something else in his cage, he's still singing along. If they had other bird sitting titles, I'd buy them in a heartbeat.",1442620800,,822,4.2756410256410255
8044802,1,B00075E24S,"I let him watch this once when I was at work. Worst decision ever. That entire afternoon all he did was scream. In general he never really screamed before. He would get loud on occasion, but immediately would put himself in time out and not do it again. After this video though it was like he was a different bird. I will never play this for him ever again.",1391990400,,357,4.188405797101449
8044803,4,B00075E24S,My Parrots (Greys and Macaws) love this. It really gets them singing along.  They sing and dance and can imitate the calls of the birds on the video.,1389916800,,149,4.321428571428571
