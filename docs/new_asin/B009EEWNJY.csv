8540559,5,B009EEWNJY,"I love this DVD. It's not like the TV shows where you can't tell if you hear a bump because of a hokey soundtrack, or. It sure if there might be a ghost seen in night vision. It is great storytelling by Savannah locals, guided along by a charismatic, attractive host. I love to play it in the background at home while I'm cooking or doing chores... But that's not really a good idea because even after having seen the whole thing, I find myself stopping whatever I'm doing to hear a favorite story, pouring a glass of wine and I end up glued to the set, watching the show, again! A very classy production.",1397779200,,605,4.269565217391304
8540560,5,B009EEWNJY,"After visiting Savannah several times I fell in love with the history, the old buildings and tales of ghosts. I scheduled two tours with Shannon Scott and since he was so informative during the tours, I was anxious to see the film.  It did not disappoint me.  I certainly enjoyed the interviews with ""real"" people who have had ghostly experiences, considering I have had a few of my own. I learned a lot more about Savannah in this film.  The way the film was put together was different and much more interesting than your regular documentary films.
If you love Savannah like I do, try this film.",1385942400,,596,4.5514018691588785
8540561,5,B009EEWNJY,"This is a great DVD for those interested in the paranormal, as it gives a unique look at that side of Savannah. This is different than your typical 'haunted tour' of the city, as it goes inside the homes of local residents, and documents their experiences first hand. Footage from places such as the third floor of Moon River Brewing Company is also of interest to paranormal investigators like myself. If you've been to Savannah, and want to know more - or are planning a trip there and want a little background on the hauntings, this is a great watch. Recommended viewing!",1381536000,,574,4.637254901960785
8540562,5,B009EEWNJY,"This DVD at least should not be viewed by youngsters who've been assured by their parents that there are no such things as ghosts and the like.  Timid adults also might want to avoid it.
  Host Shannon Scott tells entertaining stories of his own ghostly experiences as well as some he's been told.  He also takes the viewer into the haunted homes of a couple of Savannah residents to hear their tales of spooky happenings.
  If you're a fan of the supernatural and/or the beautiful, historic city of Savannah, then I think you'd enjoy this DVD.  Just remember not to let the young kiddies see it, or else they might spend the rest of their childhood wanting to sleep in your bedroom each night.",1369008000,,694,4.548387096774194
8540563,5,B009EEWNJY,"If you enjoy feeling like you are included in the dialog and want to learn some history along with the paranormal, this just may be for you.

Everyone in my family has watched and enjoyed this dvd on several occasions. It gets trotted out with the hundreds of photos we took in Savannah. Best bet...contact Shannon Scott for a ""Paranormalist"" tour and see and hear the real thing. Then go watch this video (bet you can still buy them straight from him) and listen to him guide you through several accounts of unexplained activity with his personal friends and experiences.

Like all home grown movies, the editing is hinky at times, but this dvd is fun to watch and well worth the time and money invested.",1355702400,,705,4.587301587301587
8540564,5,B009EEWNJY,"My wife and really enjoyed watching this DVD. I also have had the pleasure of meeting Shannon Scott, and unlike a lot of other Haunted Tails Shannon has a lot of proven facts and does a excellent job telling them.",1352764800,,213,4.35
8540565,5,B009EEWNJY,"Very good documentary, enjoyed the show and learned a few things. If your interestestes in paranormal it's a must buy.",1348531200,,118,4.95
8540566,5,B009EEWNJY,"After watching this with a friend ,I have determined that I must have my own copy. This truly belongs in any reputable collection of classics and would make a great gift for like-minded friends. After you get one for yourself first that is. I tip my hat,very well executed.",1348531200,,273,4.591836734693878
