3952210,5,B002MED6CG,This is an excellent show from one of the most talented singers ever. It comes with a cd of all the songs from the show. I've watched the dvd 5 times already and I've only had it a week. I've downloaded the cd to my mp3 player and can't wait for Delta's songs to come on. She is a great singer and entertainer. I would compare her voice to Celine Dion and Elvis Presley. One of the best singers ever. This is a must have for all to see and enjoy.,1257552000,,446,3.912087912087912
3952211,5,B002MED6CG,"Watching the DVD was like reliving the concert all over again. Being a huge Delta fan, I may appear bias here, but her Believe Again tour was fantastic!! I could honestly say Delta is one of those singers who will not disappoint you when shes singing live!! Great concert, brilliant vocals and wonderful audio.

This is an amazing combo for all fans as it includes the full concert on DVD and an audio CD of the concert. Not to be missed by fans. I would also recommend this to new listeners as it covers all of her hits.",1254614400,4,521,4.316326530612245

8373860,5,B002MED6CG,"I love several of her songs.  However, I bought this mostly for ""Together We Are One"". It is my favorite song by her.  I have been wanting to buy it since 2009.  I kept on hoping that they would release a greatest hits collection of hers from Australia in the US.  But, so far they haven't. Together We are One is an out of print, expensive, import cd single release.  Finally, last summer I noticed this concert DVD also included a CD of the concert, which included ""Together We are One"".  So, finally, after so many years, I finally have the song!  It is disappointing that she introduces the band during the song.  Regardless, it still sounds great!",1499385600,,652,4.466101694915254

8373863,3,B002MED6CG,"The CD was great ( Her voice is even better live than in the studio.)but since the DVD was in PAL format"" I will never know"".  My fault; I should have known that anything outside of Nortn America would be a different format.",1352592000,,224,4.209302325581396
8373864,5,B002MED6CG,"As the other reviews have noted, this is an amazing video. Delta gives 110% to her live performances. Just be aware that this is PAL DVD format (at least the copy I purchased from Amazon was) and was disappointed that it wouldn't play on my Sony DVD player or PS3.  Fortunately it will play on my computer, but it's not the same...",1317340800,3,331,4.338709677419355

I just love this DVD, way better from the Visualize Tour...

You will not regret it!!!",1282003200,,146,4.538461538461538
8373867,5,B002MED6CG,"Delta Goodrem is such a good entretainer! Her voice is amazing, even better live!
This show was like a dream and watching the DVD is pretty much like being there too! I coudn't be there in January, but this dvd gives me a great idea of what is like to be on a Delta show!
It's so unbelievable goo!",1259971200,,297,4.0508474576271185
8373868,5,B002MED6CG,"Delta is just awesome. She sings for real. She plays piano and guitar, dances well, and she's gorgeous. Her band and backup singers are very good. I wish this tour had come to the US. It's amazing to see a true talent write, play, and sing their music without electronic enhancement. 5 stars. She also has fun with her music and interaction with the audience that is sincere. Very impressive. Please Delta don't give up on the U.S.; our young ladies desperately need a role model like you and all you have to do is be yourself. The whole role model thing isn't fair, I know, but, it is a part of fame. Delta has achieved more in her 25 years than most of us achieve in a lifetime.",1259280000,4,680,4.27906976744186
