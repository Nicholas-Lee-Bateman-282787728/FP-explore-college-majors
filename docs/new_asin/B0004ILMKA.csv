8660122,2,B0004ILMKA,"I believe this video would be perfect for the individual who's concept of fishing is stick, line, bobber, hook, and worm(complete with smiley face).  That individual would learn quite a bit.  For someone who has been raised freshwater fishing in the Pacific Northwest and is looking to get into Saltwater fishing in warmer waters I've done one of two things: a)underestimated what my Father taught me,and/or b) grossly overestimated what this video could teach me.  I bought this video to get insight into the peticulars of saltwater fishing to see if I could glean some good advice, much like going fishing with an ol'timer who always seems to have the most ingenious solutions to the most basic of problems.  Alas, I was wrong.  Overlooking the fact that this video is of poor quality, most likely shot with a home video camera, and narrated by a man who sounds like he's speaking out of his nose, it contains the most basic of advice.  ""If you set your drag to what you think is right, but the fish keep breaking your line, you're doing it wrong.""  Really!?  If I wanted to listen to masters of the obvious I'd watch ESPN Sportscenter and listen to how the other team won the game because they got the ball in the endzone more.  But considering the popularity of ESPN Sportcenter perhaps I'm underestimating the need for people to be told the blatantly obvious and that Bad weather + Ocean + Boat = George Clooney drowning.  So I applaud the marketing behind this video and realise that, like the fish I intend to catch, I've been douped into grabbing something shiny and found myself hooked through the lip.  So maybe the gentlemen who produced this video are good fishermen after all, even if their advice is crap.",1287878400,,1719,4.677740863787376
