8286938,5,B001CDFY3C,"This video, ""Pinky Dinky Doo: Polka Dot Pox"" was a wonderful Christmas present for our 2 year old Great-granddaughter.  It's her favorite movie and she loved it!",1388534400,,161,4.962962962962963

8286940,5,B001CDFY3C,"My 5yo used to LOVE watching this show when she was 2 and 3, when it came on Noggin/Nick Jr.  Now I can only find this one DVD and all 3 of my girls (5, 3 & 3) LOVE Pinky and her great stories.  And it's hilarious to hear my toddlers sing ""yesarooni posituny!""  The animation, the stories that teach the kids something, and the guinea pig are super hits in our house.",1361577600,,367,4.0
8286941,4,B001CDFY3C,"We always liked Pinky Dinky Doo, but can't find it on TV ant longer. This DVD has 4 cute stories with interactive activities at the end of each. My 3 year old loves it (I even like them, too).",1336521600,,192,3.948717948717949
8286942,5,B001CDFY3C,I love this show for my daughter.  She has been watching Pinky for a couple of years. She is now 5.  We bought this because we did not have Nick Jr or Noggin on our cable.  In every episode Pinky has big word alerted by a trumpet sound.  Kids learn the word because it will repeat several times throughout the story.  The colors are bright and the music is catchy.,1257033600,,364,4.142857142857143
8286943,5,B001CDFY3C,"My sons love this in Spanish and English .. it's creative and stimulating and fun. This version has American accents which are OK but a little less expressive than the British English version.
For some reason there are a few more available in Spanish only than in either English version.
I wish I could get more episodes but as this programme is from the BBC and has been around for a few years I don't expect to see more now. What a pity!
Great for girls and great for boys to appreciate intelligent girls.",1246752000,,507,4.404255319148936
8286944,5,B001CDFY3C,"This is a great show. My daughters both watch it on Noggin whenever its on. But of course they want to watch it a lot more then its actually on. I am pretty sure that this is the only Pink Dinky DVD released as of right now. Its great, my daughters and I are very happy. It even has some interactive games that they can play with the DVD remote.",1234915200,,345,3.942857142857143
