A steam locomotive rushes through the night. A man plays a harmonica in a boxcar. Two tramps talk about their past. Then two men are pushed off the train! Can they thumb a ride? Somebody left a wagon with horses on the road. The two men borrow the wagon for a ride. The lawmen pursue them, shots are fired. Explosives are aboard! Three riders join them. Reno asks them to follow him. Mistaken identification? They are asked to dynamite a water hole to put a ranch out of business. Bob recognizes that pistol, it belonged to his uncle. The job must be done today. Bob plants the charge. One fails to explode. The Sheriff arrives. Bob wants to find out who is behind this gang, and has a plan. Rusty will impersonate Bob Redford.

Bob is told to get rid of the new owner of the Circle R by first joining as a ranch hand. Curt Harris offers to buy the ranch. Curt orders his men to get rid of the two men. They shoot at them until the Sheriff arrives. Bob returns alone, the Sheriff arrests him. Bob gets away; later he is pursued by Renos gang. Bob accuses Curt of being the head of the gang. There is a discussion. Renos gang arrives, Bob stops them. The Sheriff arrives, Bob tells him to arrest Reno for murder. Reno says Curt did it. Bob gets Curt inside for a fist fight. Bob wins against the bigger man. Bob explains to Miss Andrews why he operated undercover. Hes the boss now. There is a last joke by Rusty.

This is a story with complications. It is part murder mystery, part wrongful accusation, and part about recovering an inheritance. It seems to have a little of everything. The Sheriff seems too comical at times. It lacks the singing often found in other Westerns.",1507766400,,1711,4.3742138364779874
8448698,5,B004YOEF04,"Bob Steele is the real deal. His movies have it all including action, adventure, romance and kicking the bad guys butts. Being from the 30s and 40s the picture quality isn`t the best in the world but that will not stop you from enjoying these awesome western movies. If was Bob Steele who paved the way for western greats who would come after such as Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Randolph Scott and John Wayne.",1476662400,,405,4.486486486486487
