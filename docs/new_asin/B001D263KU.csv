8291115,2,B001D263KU,"Only five years ago, these kinds of anthologies barely existed in the DVD marketplace and now they've become quite common. Which is great as far as I am concerned, since I am a fan of Christmas episodes of TV series.

However, because so many of them are available these days, I know a good one from a poor one, and this is the poorest that I've seen (I own many). Let's start with the shows themselves, none of which are household names--which in itself does not make them worthless, but normally if it's never seen the light of day in syndication there is a pretty good reason. The uncomfortably mean-spirited ""Joe Santa Claus"" probably is the best of the lot, although the included episode of ""The Paul Winchell Show,"" which closes out the DVD, is solid. The two shows in the middle, ""The Ruggles"" and ""You Asked for It"" (particularly the latter) are snorefests that are so technically flawed that at points it is hard to follow what exactly is happening.

I don't regret the purchase, but this is far from being a must-watch.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Sets-Holiday-2-Pack/dp/B0040PEZWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Sets: Holiday 2-Pack</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-TV-Classics-Vol-2/dp/B000B5XPG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas TV Classics, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;would be infinitely better ways of spending your money.",1324771200,2,1443,6.034146341463415

It came promptly and in good condition.
Thank you.",1262995200,7,91,4.75
8291118,5,B001D263KU,"Finally, The Ruggles tv series on DVD!
I've been looking for any episodes of The Ruggles for ages! I love Charlie Ruggles & this beloved series from televisions golden age. Such clean, wholesome values & good old fashioned fun the way it should be. This show is poignant & heartwarming. I think other fans of this particular genre will agree.

Go to TVShowsOnDVD's site to cast your vote for a release of The Ruggles  (1949-1952) to DVD. Also, a DVD containing four additional episodes can be found by a merchant on eBay.

This is a treat for sure due to the fact that only a handful of episodes still exist as this program had been done on live television & what has been preserved was shot on kinescope. This holiday episode is a keeper!",1224720000,21,739,4.5
