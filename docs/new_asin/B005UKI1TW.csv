4894052,5,B005UKI1TW,"Item rec'd promptly/pristine condition; highly recommend this seller!
This was a wonderful concert from start to finish.  Bocelli was perfection, as always, the Orchestra, Conductor and Westminster Choir were sublime and the guest performances were thrilling. Even the rain didn't dampen the appreciation of the audience.  It was perfection in all ways--truly memorable and I will treasure having it on my shelf for repeat performances!!",1355875200,,437,5.707692307692308
4894053,4,B005UKI1TW,"Andrea may be the world's best singer.  While it was difficult for me to appreciate some of the songs (particularly in Italian),
there were a few that were breathtaking.  The ending was spectacular.  You can't go wrong with this Blu-ray.",1354924800,,237,4.875
4894054,5,B005UKI1TW,If you enjoy Andrea Bocelli you will absolutely love this. It's such a great relaxing musical treat. Item shipped fast.,1354579200,,119,5.0
4894055,5,B005UKI1TW,"I think this concert is one of the best Andrea has ever done! The quality of his voice has exceeded anything he has ever done. I think he will have a hard time topping this but everytime I say that, he manages to top any of his previous work. I have a collection of his DVD's and THIS is the best of them all. Concerto all the way!",1350432000,,331,3.8823529411764706
4894056,5,B005UKI1TW,"Anyone that has listened to Andrea Bocelli will agree that there is something magical in his voice that reaches deep into the soul.  It isn't necessary to understand the language to become completely engaged.  The addition of the other great singers sharing in the wonderful Italian Operas made the DVD a delightful experience, but so did the renditions of pop music done in grand American style.  No one could imagine an opera singer swinging the song, ""More"", and so effortlessly.  The flute, trumpet and violin accompanying this marvelous voice in selections transports you to another musical high.  Don't miss his duet with Tony Bennett singing, ""I Love New York"".  There is so much in this video to please everyone in your household.  Make it a family event.  Spend an evening with this DVD, and it will be a night to remember.",1349568000,,832,4.851063829787234
4894057,5,B005UKI1TW,"The PBS / Great Performances crowd did a super job of capturing this live performance on video -- and what a performance it is! Andrea Bocelli sings his heart out, and there isn't a bad song to be found anywhere.  On the contrary, many of the performances are thrilling: ""Amazing Grace"" and a few others brought tears to my eyes.  The audience reaction shots show that they were just as thrilled.

If you love music, you want this DVD!",1347667200,,435,4.481012658227848
4894058,5,B005UKI1TW,"Bocelli shares his stage with a number of top singers -- all accompanied by the NY Philharmonic Orchestra (Alan Gilbert, conductor) and Westminster Symphonic Choir. The mixture of classical and pop music has wide appeal for the variety of tastes of a huge NY Central Park crowd. I can't stop watching the DVD!",1346889600,,309,4.849056603773585
4894059,5,B005UKI1TW,"I had to watch it twice to fully let the show sink in as this is a longer and more vocally demanding show compared to his previous Vivere. Some pretty complex opera songs are performed, so take your time to digest this.

Opera buffs would be pleased as Concerto's Act 1 shews more towards classics from Verdi and Puccini with help from guests Bryn Terfel, Ana Maria Martinez, Pretty Yende and the New York Philharmonic.

Act 2 trots out the pop classics such as More with Chris Botti, The Prayer with Celine Dion and New York, New York with Tony Bennett. Andrea Griminelli does a really buzzing The Flight Of The Bumblebee on flute. Italian favourites such as Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu (Volare) also got the raincoat clad crowd swinging. It closes with the signature Time To Say Goodbye and then Andrea does the soaring Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turandot, bringing the show to an explosive climax!

Concerto brings back the wonderful memory of Andrea's show on 8 May 2010 held at Singapore's Botanic Gardens. Special guests include soprano Sabina Cvilak, flutist Anrea Griminelli and singer Delta Goodrem. Eugene Kohn conducted Singapore's Philharmonic Orchestra. Organised by Tan Sri (Dr) Francis Yeoh, MD of Malaysia's YTL Corp, tickets are free and audience members are picked through ballot. I could not get the tickets to see Andrea directly and had to settle for tickets to see him via video screen. But audiences are treated to complimentary Kentucky Fried Chicken meals and ice cream. The souvenir bag had a programme, a 3 Tenors DVD, raincoats and bottled water among many other things. A truly unforgettable evening!",1345593600,24,1626,4.927007299270073
4894060,5,B005UKI1TW,I highly recommend this DVD. I have other DVD and CD's by him and none have disapointed me.  The songs and guests have always been great.,1343001600,14,137,4.269230769230769
4894061,5,B005UKI1TW,"I can not believe that no one has written a review on this CD!  Man, you can just
close your eyes and make believe that Andrea is singing every word to you!  His voice
is magnificent, his co-singers are awesome and David Foster is just as perfect as he
always is!  This music should be played for every child in pre K to understand the world
has music that is worth more than one lifetime!

Andrea..........I love you and your music!",1337472000,18,433,4.308641975308642

4894087,2,B005UKI1TW,"A poor choice compared to his live concert in Italy. The talent was better and the Blu Ray  sound quality much better. The DTS Master track was thin and dynamics were limited.

4894156,4,B005UKI1TW,"This is a great show, but it has a little too much opera for us. If you like opera, you'll love this;  His best stuff for most Americans would be 'Live in Tuscany' or 'Under the Desert Sky' out by Lake Las Vegas. Those two I think are his best, but this one is right up there with them if you like opera.",1371945600,,304,3.8253968253968256
4894157,5,B005UKI1TW,"I saw this special for PBS three times and still bought the DVD I loved it so much. His voice is so incredibly beautiful and so are the voices of those he duets with including reuniting with Celine Dion for ""The Prayer"" was so magnificent but for me the highlight and I wasn't expecting it was when he returned for the encore and sang ""Nessin Dorma"" it made the hair on my neck stand up.
In a time when music lyrics and quality and artists now are at an all-time low I am really appreciating the artists of my generation who not only were the best but have stood the test of time. I want to make sure I own as many of their bodies of work as I can.

Cd's such as this one can be brought out every holiday season and enjoyed. I especially like having all the concerts, I just keep putting on different ones  and with today's bigscreen tv's and sound systems it's almost like being at the concerts.",1371168000,4,896,4.173410404624278

4894174,4,B005UKI1TW,"This is good, just not great. Andrea good as always, but I would have preferred more classical and less 'pop'. The Orchestra was great, as were the guests, and the photography as well. I just prefer to have either a classical or a 'pop' program. I have two other other Bocelli programs that are single-themed, and love them. One of the tings that I wish they would do on these videos is put a notation with the title of the piece of music. Some pieces are easily recognizable, some are not.",1360108800,,490,4.395604395604396

Los msicos son excelentes, el audio muy bien. la calidad de la imagen tambin.
El documental muestra cmo se realiz el concierto sus etapas de planeacion y ejecucin y cmo estuvo a punto de ser cancelado por los problemas climticos.
Las presentaciones de Tony Bennett, Celine Dion y Ana Mara Martnez son excepcionales.

4894178,2,B005UKI1TW,"After seeing the ratings, I thought this would be a great Bocelli concert - I own the others - but it did not live up to the rating - the NY philharmonic was great, as were the guest instumentalists, but the guest singers did not measure up, nor did the material chosen. Celine's performance was lackluster (especially in comparison to Heather Headley on the same song in the Tuscan concert). And home on the range in NYC? - give me a break! Buy the others, give this a pass",1358553600,,474,4.337078651685394
