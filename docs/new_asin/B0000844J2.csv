1825879,3,B0000844J2,"First off, ""Winter Kills"" (the film) deserves 5 STARS. It's a terrific black comedy about (GASP!) a presidential assassination that would make an interesting double-bill with Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And like ""JFK"", the film is packed with cameo appearances by a stellar cast, with John Huston stealing every scene he's in as a randy, Joseph Kennedy, Sr.-type political patriarch. It's based on the novel of the same name by Richard Condon who also wrote ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" and, while not as complex as that novel or film, ""Winter Kills"" is a must-see for conspiracy buffs with a healthy appreciation for dark, irreverant humor. You'll be hooked through all of the twists and red herrings to the shocking final confrontation which concludes one of the most memorable images in screen history.
The movie was plagued with production problems (even requiring a two-year hiatus to raise money to complete shooting), butchered by its original distributors, who then gave it an aborted theatrical release. In 1983, a VHS tape was released, recut to the director's concept with the original ending restored, and that is the version that appears on this DVD. The transfer is stunning and presented in it's original widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio and there's an interesting commentary by first-time feature director, William Richert who also adapted the novel for the screen.
My only problem with this ""package"" is that its hour or so of extras could easily have fit on one side of one disc, but Anchor Bay has chosen to pad it into two, thus jacking up the price. ... And, frankly, I was expecting more from the featurette, ""Who Killed 'Winter Kills'?"" THAT fascinating story is crammed into the last ten minutes of this 38-minute mini-documentary and still leaves a lot of questions, none of which are answered in the other two extremely short (less then 10 minutes each) extras, which are just back-slapping, ""good-to-see-you-again"" empty memory trips. Yes, there are several still galleries, and the screenplay is on DVD-ROM, but, again, all of this could have fit on one disc.
Anchor Bay should be congratulated for bringing this film to DVD, but chided for trying to bleed the consumer out of a few extra bucks. They're NOT The Criterion Collection and, in the future, they should take their cue from MGM who did such a spectaclar job on the Special Edition of ""The Usual Suspects"". The widescreen and pan&scan versions of the film were on one side, hours of extras were on the reverse (See my review for the details.) and the price was more than reasonable, it was downright cheap for all you were given.
So, at the expense of a great 5-STAR movie, I'm ""charging"" Anchor Bay two stars for being greedy and giving the package only three.",1048377600,2,2740,4.932900432900433
1825890,4,B0000844J2,"This 1979 movie was the original conspiracy movie surrounding the JFK assassination (here it is a fictional President Kegan) before Oliver Stone did a much better job with his movie. This movie does reveal ""who killed President Kegan,"" though I always assumed the public preferred an answer that matched one of the pet theories of the day for who killed the real President Kennedy, rather than the movie's clever yet meaningful plot twist.

Some aspects of this movie are horribly dated. Like, it used to be considered a romantic that the main character would want to marry the leading lady (that he just met). Now this behavior seems naive and creepy. Or, the signature scene of John Huston holding on to the American flag as he falls to his death now looks silly and too obvious. On the other hand, the conspiracy theory aspect of this movie is great. Hollywood has done more complicated movies with better plot twists, but this movie does surprise and paranoia better than most. Like an Alfred Hitchcock movie, it's what you don't see that gives this movie its power. I think people who have seen this movie will agree that ""the lady on the bicycle"" is a plot device unique to this movie, and it still works all these years later. It is truly worth the price of admission. The themes about wealth, financial empires, and spying on the public certainly haven't lost any of their relevance. And while the bar for what we consider crude has been raised so many times since this movie came out in 1979, I was surprised and delighted to find some of the utterances from the John Huston character as shocking as ever. I still found myself thinking, ""I can't believe he just said that.""

This movie has some other great little nuggets in it. Like Belinda Bauer taking of her pants to conform to the dress code of a fancy restaurant. You may know from Psycho that Anthony Perkins is the master of creep. He does not disappoint here. His character hits some bizarre notes that I have not seen elsewhere.

Okay, there is nothing remarkable about this movie overall, but I like movies that after watching I can honestly say two things. One, that was fun. Two, I have not seen a movie like this before.",1418860800,5,2193,4.6179487179487175

Almost every lead turns out to be a false one. For the most part it follows Richard Condon's novel pretty closely. The cast and crew had great difficulty completing the film due to funding problems.

1825910,5,B0000844J2,Ted Kennedy was still viable as a Presidential candidate when Winter Kills was made and still had enough juice to hold it's release and ultimately keep the film from being the success it should have been. It's a very good film.,1354406400,,227,4.560975609756097
1825911,4,B0000844J2,"Jeff Bridges put his career on the line to finish this movie. From watching it, it hardly seems worth the effort, but you have to admire his principles. If the story behind the making of the movie is fascinating, the movie itself has problems, not least of which is John Huston, a great director, not actor, playing the most important part. The plot is based on President Kennedy's assasination. The rumor was that Ted Kennedy had the distribution of the film curtailed because he was running for President at the time ""Winter Kills"" was finally released. If he did, he was misguided because the family depicted had little resemblance to the Kennedys, and trying to suppress the movie only gave it more credibility. I think at the time the film didn't meet audience expectations because the stars who were heavily advertised had small parts in the film. Of these turns, I liked Anthony Perkins', Sterling Hayden's, and Dorothy Malone's the best. I would recommend the movie for fans of those actors.",1347408000,2,999,4.847953216374269

1825913,3,B0000844J2,"WINTER KILLS wants to parallel the Kennedy assassination in a somewhat satirical manner. It fails to achieve the flight of imagination that Kubrick brought to DR STRANGELOVE. John Huston is channeling the evil nature of his character from CHINATOWN. Huston in WINTER KILLS does not have the detailed characterisation and the essence of evil that he portrayed in CHINATOWN. There are some inspired scenes such as the assassination of the victims in the car early on in the film that had a surreal sense in the manner that the three victims were assassinated, with Jeff Bridges the only surviving member. There weren't enough inspired scenes that would have lifted this film to cult status such as Dr STRANGELOVE. Elli Wallach has one of the best scenes in the film as he's recruited as a mechanic in the presidential assassination of Jeff Bridges brother to only realise he's in over his head. This film is a curiousity piece and deserves a few repeated viewings with cameo appearance from Sterling Hayden as a crazed tank driving General. Vilmos Zigmond widescreen photography is a stand-out. We have gangsters, assassins, government involvement, anti-Castro Cubans that parallel Kennedy's assassination. I wanted more disturbing scenes that needed to be more subversive in the telling of this story. At the end of the day the director didn't have the money he needed to make this film and probaly tell the story he wanted to tell. Part of the film was funded by orgainsed criminals and the one of the investors in this film was killed. There were scenes the director wanted to film but the budget wasn't there and had made a compromised film. Still this film deserves a few viewings.",1314662400,,1684,4.933098591549296

1825918,4,B0000844J2,"""Winter Kills"" isn't a particularly great film but it had the potential to be one.  Richard Condon's dark comic source material is handled adequately by writer-director William Richert but a more assured hand could have really spiced up this Kennedy-esque conspiracy tale.  What makes the film worthwhile is the work of the veteran character actors on hand particularly Sterling Hayden and John Huston who chew the scenery in royal fashion.  Their performances demand the audience to take note of the material's twisted overtones but Richert, to a degree, undermines them.  Jeff Bridges, with his classic movie star looks but a character actors thought process, wisely defers to his older compatriots.  Just a thought:  In 1985, Huston brought Condon's ""Prizzi's Honor"" to the screen with smashing results.  One could only imagine what he could have accomplished if he was at the helm of this venture.",1196985600,4,901,5.215277777777778
1825929,3,B0000844J2,"The movie is described as being a ""black comedy.""  Well --- I suppose so.  At times the plot developments, such as they were, seemed so paranoid that the intended satirical effect gets buried.  It also doesn't help that practically every conspiracy theory known to man gets vacuumed-packed into a film barely an hour and a half long, because the result is an unfocused film that is all over the place.

It shouldn't be taken as a comment on the Kennedy assassination & its aftermath...President Kegan and his family bear only slight resemblance to the Kennedys.  I suppose the film was intended to lampoon, as much as anything, the subculture of conspiracy theories --- I guess.  Between the meandering plot and some breathtaking scenery-chewing on the part of John Huston, Anthony Perkins, and Sterling Hayden, I found myself pretty lost.

All in all, I found myself somewhat disappointed by a film which promised a lot more than it ultimately delivered.",1182988800,2,955,4.968553459119497

1825931,4,B0000844J2,"""Winter Kills"" is far less interesting than the story behind its production (which makes the bonus features on this 2 disc set very worthwhile), but William Richert's adaptation of Richard Condon's novel is worthy of the cult status it has enjoyed since its brief release more than two decades ago.

In retrospect, ""Winter Kills"" almost looks like something of a warm-up for Oliver Stones' ""JFK,"" a more ambitious conspiracy thriller made 12 years later. Some of the dialogue in ""Winter Kills"" seems to have been revived, almost word-for-word, in Stone's film. But while ""JFK"" is more of an altar promoting Kennedy worship, ""Winter Kills"" is downright contemptuous of Camelot and of those who wield power in general.

Jeff Bridges stars as the half brother of an assassinated United States president, obviously patterned on John F. Kennedy, who learns, via Richard Boone, that a second gunman was involved. Spurred on by his powerful king-maker father (John Huston), Bridges sets out to expose the conspiracy.

""Winter Kills"" is an eccentrically entertaining ride with a cast that can only be described as a movie lover's dream.

In addition to the always sincere Bridges and the unforgettable Huston, there's Sterling Hayden as a crazed war-mad defense contractor, and the magnificently larger-than-life Boone as a character who may or may not be worthy of the trust Bridges places in him. Ralph Meeker (the screen's best Mike Hammer), Toshiro Mifune, Eli Wallach, and even Elizabeth Taylor, all turn up in small but key roles, and there's Anthony Perkins as the head of the computer run information center that spies on Huston's enemies - and friends - while Perkins'wife, Berry Berenson, appears briefly as a morgue attendant. (She would later die in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.)

Kennedy lovers condemned ""Winter Kills"" during its brief controversial theatrical release, and its doubtful they'll warm to it now, but for those who look with skepticism on politics regardless of party, or simply appreciate perverse cinema, ""Winter Kills"" is worth a look.

This movie is full of wild speculation and crazy, paranoid and zany characters.

The documentary about the making of the movie was just as compelling as the origional film.

Huston's megalomaniacal Mr. Burns cum Palmer Eldritch cum Citizen Kane is diabolically delicious and the kind of character that should show up in one of the Hollywood retrospectives they show when a host is caught up snorting lines backstage during the Oscars. In fact, ""Winter Kills"" teems with offbeat characterizations that might flutter off into self-absorbed zaniness if not for Jeff Bridges in a competent everyman role. Perkins performs the kind of inspired cameo that makes you shake your head he couldn't have broken free of the ""Psycho"" mold. Sterling Hayden, interestingly, plays a character that could very well be the same power-mad general he played in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" retired now and protecting his land with tanks. And Liz Taylor is perfect in her split-second appearance as a sort of doughboy Heidi Fleiss, dolled up and glassy-eyed. Bridges, tempered amid the maelstrom and a smart, multilayered ""whodunit"" script keeps the film grounded.

Not to mention exquisite cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond and an astounding debut for director/actor/etc., William Richert. This film was way too early for it's time, and in the same way Welles' Citizen Kane stepped on the feet of a giant this film also played with the thinly veiled mythology of real people, in this case the Kennedys. The story of why this brilliant film was stillborn upon it's initial release is likely a story worthy of the intrigue and rampant angst that fuels this spectacular film itself; though it's only hinted at in the Who Killed Winter Kills documentary, (that helps to flesh out the second disc disc of this set). I must admit that this all could have fit well onto one disc; but whatever the form, this is a film that is well worth seeking out, and it holds up very well to repeated viewings.

Richard Condon's dazzlingly paranoid comic novel about an American president's assassination investigation has been perfectly captured by writer-director William Richert. This little seen film, barely released in 1979 after a torturous, much delayed production, received strong reviews and then disappeared.
There was talk the Kennedy family didn't approve and put pressure on parent company Avco Embassy (which had military contract associations) to withdraw the film, Condon suggested in an article, ""Who Killed Winter Kills"" for Harper's magazine.  Whatever the case -- and the story behind the filming is certainly as interesting as the film story -- this marvelous, all-star thriller about the brother of a murdered president looking into the killing plays with the darkest, almost subconscious fears this country has collectively harbored about the death of JFK.
The once in a lifetime cast includes: Jeff Bridges, John Huston, Sterling Hayden, Richard Boone, Elizabeth Taylor, Eli Wallach, Ralph Meeker, Toshiro Mifune and Belinda Bauer.  Plus a great score by Maurice Jarre (Lawrence of Arabia).

7978829,5,B0000844J2,"Winter Kills is the darkest of dark comedies; a subtle, stylish, intricate & extremely droll allegory, with the emphasis on dark. It is a prophetic story decades ahead of its time, presaging the kind of dark, morally murky madness we find ourselves trapped in today.

Winter Kills is based on the book of the same name by Richard Condon, the master of the dark comedy novel, who also wrote the Manchurian Candidate, Prizzis Honor & a many other sardonic gems in the 60s & 70s, when irony was still an art, before it became just another stale motif.

The story is a circuitous, multi-layered & often perplexing tale of a naive young man's search for the assassins of his older brother, a popular U.S. president, obviously modeled on JFK. A search that leads him into the corrupt, convoluted labyrinth of international intrigue & global business, corporate espionage; as one character puts it, riddles within riddles. (But as good as the movie is, the book is of course far better.)

The all-star cast is excellent. Jeff Bridges plays the younger brother of the slain president, naive to the point of gullible & easily misled - a proxy for the credulous average American. In a wonderfully wry performance, the great film director John Houston (The Maltese Falcon, The African Queen, Prizzi's Honor, et al) plays his stony taskmaster father, a ruthless corrupt patriarchal tycoon who goads & bullies Bridges as he searches for the killer. Along the way he encounters numerous colorful characters, played by veterans like Anthony Perkins, Eli Wallach, Richard Boone, & Liz Taylor, who flesh out the film.

Production values are high & despite a few uneven scenes, other scenes are spectacular. It certainly helps to see it in HD on a large screen. Director William Richert shows a few bad habits of 70s Hollywood, like the use of servo-zoom lenses, flat TV-style lighting & busy location settings, but the lovely cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond more than makes up for it. The script by Condon is acerbic & trenchant and the sharp dialogue often fast-paced, so you have to pay attention. The suspenseful score is by brilliant composer Maurice Jarre.

Sadly, Winter Kills isn't quite the masterpiece it might have been. But like Dr. Strangelove, Catch 22 & M*A*S*H, it has the kind of subtle, sardonic, razon-sharp multi-faceted humor seldom if ever seen today. The kind of dark, serious wit that you get it or you dont.

If you do get it, however, its hilarious, especially the mordant Hitchcockian finale.

Despite its minor flaws, Winter Kills is a brilliant, important film, well worth seeing and gets better with repeated viewings.",1508716800,,2632,4.954648526077097

This movie has substance, charm, humor, stars: the best performance/character since Chinatown for John Houston......but real great explosions.....no......but if you want see a masterpiece more paranoid then The Parallax View....made by real human beings-.......this is your film......and of course , like with all real artists/dreamers it's based on a true story.",1500854400,,1619,5.92274678111588

Problem for me is, Winter Kills"" isn't quite as much fun as it's champion's insist. Still, it has it's moments, and if you are curious I would say ""go ahead and get this edition for your collection, especially if you can still get a great price like I did.""",1500768000,,409,4.394736842105263
7978832,3,B0000844J2,"First of all, this would get five starts from me, but the Amazon  version presented here is shorter, though at this time it might be the only way one can watch it, though it recently was shown on TCM. At the beginning when we see Bridges riding on his horse, and then getting off and shouting, ""you stink Pa"", it does not make any sense here considering two key scenes which we miss. Could not help but think of Orson Welles with this director William Richert. His first film, and really only major film I believe, just like Kane for Welles, though Welles against alludes would continue to make some masterpieces. While this film is not as good as Kane, it does somewhat resemble Welles Mr. Arkadian, and this one is better. Hopefully a new DVD version, or blueray will be released, the early 2000 version not available now. A film that deserves to be seen bemire people. John Huston is sensational.",1492300800,,899,4.549382716049383

A few convoluted plot twists make you scratch your head - the war games scene - do not otherwise detract from a very watchable movie.  Come into the movie without high expectations and you will enjoy the 2 hour diversion.",1485993600,,320,5.018867924528302

WINTER KILLS: Who to trust, clucks the sinister Cerutti (Perkins). Who to trust? Certainly nobody in this menagerie, which is filled with red herrings, sleazy weasels, sitting ducks, snakes-in-the-grass, cat-and-mouse games and dog-eat-dog deals and deceptionsnot to mention a one-to-one correspondence with the major players in the JFK assassination (according to some theories). (If this were a book, it would be a roman  clef.)

Huston is a hoot as the ubiquitous, mega-rich megalomaniac, an amoral, foul-mouthed leering old lech, and the solution to the conspiracy is a Hitchcockian shocker. But is it really an incestuous web of treachery? Or is it just good business?

Rent this one for: the Dead Hams Society: Huston, Boone and Hayden, each energetically attempting to chew more scenery than any of the others (Huston wins); for the sheer moxie of turning the JFK assassination into a Marx Bros. farce: One of the blackest moments in American history turned into one of the blackest comedies on filmthe JFK assassination on psychedelics.",1423267200,2,1299,5.027906976744186
