8304292,5,B001G7ID0K,"I love it. I only wished that I had collected all the episodes on DVD when I had the chance. Totodile is so funny especially in the totodile duel episode. I was hoping that the filmmakers would re-release them since it was the Johto Journeys season 10th anniversary but, I can see that's not happening. Any way beside that I totally recommend this DVD to any Pokemon fan from the past or present who either grew up when the show started or watched it in the middle of the six or seventh season of the series.",1328400000,,508,4.302083333333333
