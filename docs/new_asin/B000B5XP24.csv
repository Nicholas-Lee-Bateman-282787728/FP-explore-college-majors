2402056,5,B000B5XP24,Murderball is an amazing documentary. It'll  make you think about these group of amazing athelets who get no limelight. It'll make you cry from the sadness and joy. An inspirational documentary.,1133481600,,194,5.258064516129032
2402057,5,B000B5XP24,"""Murderball"" is the rough-and-tumble world of U.S. Wheelchair Quad Rugby, a sport with essentially tank-like wheelchairs, a ball, male pride, and a whole lot of youthful testosterone and adrenaline. There are no helmets, no shin guards, only speed, determination, and how hard you can slam your chair into your opponent to make them give up the ball/slow them down.

The documentary traces the players of Team USA: Mark Zupan, Keith Cavill, Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, and Bob Lujano, on their quest to capture the gold medal at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens. In a parallel storyline, former quad rugby star Joe Soares has jumped ship and is coaching Team Canada, leading to a bitter rivalry between the two teams.

""Murderball"" is fast-paced and furious, with loads of on-the-court wheel-cam action, a great soundtrack (I loved the haunting cello theme), tight editing, and fun moments just hanging out with Team USA to witness pranks, parties, and pick-up lines. There is graphic talk of sex as a quadriplegic, the frustrations of physical rehab and life after injury, old wounds reopened, a medical emergency, and a look at baby-faced Iraq War vets with missing limbs (they looked about fifteen) at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Part of what makes ""Murderball"" so effective as a documentary is its laid-back approach to interviews and capturing candid moments. The players aren't made out to be heroes or saints; only as human as the rest of us. Inspiring, dramatic, and a worthy tribute to the formidable Team USA.

The DVD contains a Larry King interview, Johnny Knoxville Murderball special with Mark Zupan, a featurette, interview with Joe Soares, deleted scenes, filmmaker commentary, player commentary, an update on Keith's chair, and more. (Contains sexually explicit dialogue, alcohol use and adult language).",1133395200,,1816,5.212328767123288
2402058,5,B000B5XP24,"I have seen many shows about persons with disabilities and all seem to play off the pity party.  Seeing the guys in Murderball being guys is awsome. It touches on every aspect of a persons life and how their view is different than when they were able bodied.  Life doesnt end when they became disabled, it would have ended if they had sat in a Closet and not gone out to try to be the best they can be in whatever they decided to do.  I am a Quad and an athlete and encourage all to watch even those who don't know much about life as a disabled person.",1133395200,2,552,4.045871559633028
2402059,5,B000B5XP24,"What an extraordinary film.

MURDERBALL is a documentary that follows the members of the US Wheelchair Rugby team, along with one EX-member who is now the coach for the Canadian team. (The game is referred to as ""Murderball,"" but as one of the players remarks, ""it's hard to market a sport named 'Murderball!'"").

The requirements to be a team member: Quadriplegia. And an incredible hard-hitting and competitive spirit. (Most of us, my wife included... who IS wheelchair-bound due to multiple sclerosis, were under the impression that quadriplegics had NO use of their arms, but it would seem that many quadriplegics retain a certain degree of arm and upper-body function.)

The stars of this film are inspirational. Bob Lujano is a young man who lost his arms and legs to a horrible infection as a young boy. Sitting with a group of school children, he's asked by a little girl, ""how do you eat pizza with your elbows?"" He proceeds to show them, and there is no shock or revulsion. The children are all awe-struck and smiling as this man proves that you can make your life as normal as it can possibly be, if you try.
(How many people, given a pair of gnarled stumps for arms, would live out their lives being spoon-fed by others? Quite a few, no doubt.)

The ""star"" of the film, if there is one, is Mark Zupan, a 28-year-old who's life changed when the pickup truck driven by his best friend flew off the road... and he sailed into a canal --where he remained clinging to a branch, undiscovered for 14 hours. Zupan is the kind of guy who takes no crap from anyone. Even his high school buddies point out, ""he was an a****** before the accident, and the accident didn't change him!"" But it's
obvious that they, along with pretty much everyone else loves him, and during the course of the movie it becomes pretty clear why. He's a good friend to have.

Joe Soares is the FORMER team member who became the head coach of the US team's arch-rivals, Canada. The man is EXTREMELY tightly-wound, but despite the red-faced, screaming rants, there are some very tender moments shown between him and his young son. His son, who has NOT followed in his father's extreme-sports footsteps, somewhat to his dad's disappointment, is instead an academic high-achiever, and plays (of all things) the violin
in the school band. It is a testament to good parenting (and one of many grab-the-handkerchief moments!) to see how Soares supports his son.

The film should be shown to every high school class in America. People deal with the handicapped in very odd, and many times, disturbing ways. If enough people saw this, not only would it give people a better understanding of some of the struggles faced by the disabled, but it would also serve as an inspiration for all. (In fact, my wife hasn't been in our pool for over a year because of her fear that it wouldn't 'go well.' After seeing murderball, she's planning on going for a swim tomorrow!)

*** UPDATE: The swim went just fine, and in the year since, my wife has become FAR MORE confident about herself. She is still 100% wheelchair-bound, but it's something that people forget about in about 2 minutes BECAUSE of her terrific attitude. And MURDERBALL played a part.

*** UPDATE 2: We had the opportunity to go to a Wheelchair Rugby tournament in Tampa --and thought we MIGHT see someone we recognized. Well, we not only SAW, but had a chance to chat and hang out with MARK ZUPAN, SCOTT HOGSETT and ANDY COHN, among others.  What a GREAT bunch of guys! This was months after the release of the DVD, so frankly they could have seen themselves as ""stars,"" but you sure couldn't tell.

The highlight of the day came when Scott Hogsett asked us if we'd like to join them for dinner... and though our schedule wouldn't allow this, the mere fact that they asked just made our day. (Yeah, could you imagine one of the ""mega-stars"" asking that? Not in a million years!)

2402117,4,B000B5XP24,"Murderball shows vividly that athleticism and competition cannot be defeated by physical limitations.  I learned a lot from this film (e.g., that ""quadriplegic"" doesn't always mean ""paralyzed""), but I also got drawn into the plot, following the U.S. Paralympic wheelchair rugby team to the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens.  It's legitimately R-rated, but the individual team members' stories of overcoming obstacles are inspiring.",1351555200,,430,5.809523809523809

2402119,5,B000B5XP24,"Now ""Murderball"" is called ""Wheelchair Rugby"".  They had to ""tone down"" the name for sponsors.  I still like ""Murderball"" though.

Murderball was originally created for those people who were unable to play wheelchair basketball.  Wheelchair basketball (a great sport in its own right) requires at least some use of your hands.  With Murderball you have to have both hand and leg ""issues"".  You don't even have to have hands!  As long as you can push your chair around. . . you can play Murderball.  Each player is given a ""point value"" and there is a maximum number of ""points"" allowed on the court.  It's a really fun game to watch.  It's played in the Paralympics, and this year (2012) the United States won the bronze medal.  They came SO close to going to the gold-medal-match. . . but with seconds left on the clock. . . they lost by one point.  FYI, Andy Cohn (who is in the movie) and another guy are still playing on the U.S. team.  I REALLY wish the U.S. TV networks would step-it-up and show more of the Paralympics, including ""Wheelchair Rugby"".  Go online, and you can find out where tournaments are being played around the country.  I HIGHLY recommend checking them out.  Mark Zupan used to be my favorite player. . . but now I think it's David Anthony on the British 2012 Wheelchair Rugby team!  Check him out online with the blue Mohawk!

This movie is quite inspirational. . . . and fun. You're not feeling sorry for anyone.  The only one I was feeling sorry for was myself!  I'd love to give it a try!  Hahahahaha

FYI. . If you're looking to watch a lot of the game. . . this is not the film.  There's really not a lot of play going on.  But there is enough so you get the idea of what it's all about.",1348012800,,1719,4.367088607594937
2402150,5,B000B5XP24,I had to watch this movie for class and was pleasantly surprised that it was quite humerous and lighthearted while still going into the serious parts of life.  The men in this documentary a great example of what can be done when you have the right attitude about life.  It shows you a side of the life of these men that many want to ask but are too shy to inquire.  Definitely recommend this to any sports and/or documentary lovers!,1332201600,,432,4.375
2402151,5,B000B5XP24,I found this to be an interesting look into the day-to-day world of quad rugby players. The film itself is well done. There are no violin passages or cheap tricks to make you sympathize with the people in the film. The individual stories are inspiring because they show the determination of the players to carry on self determinative lives. I bought the film because I recently met someone who plays quad rugby. The film was a good introduction to the sport. I ended up attending a match and found it a very exciting sport.,1319414400,,523,4.574468085106383

To tell the truth, I wasn't looking forward to watching it. I thought it would be boring and pathetic. I'm sooooo glad I did watch it all the way through. It was eye opening, entertaining, educational and inspiring. A great documentary/movie. The quality was good, no problems with it playing on my beat up old portable DVD player. The sound was great. It shipped fast, right on time to finish my assignment.

I'm very happy and pleased with this purchase. It was worth the price for the invaluable knowledge and inspirational insight it gave me. Definitely a must watch!

2402154,3,B000B5XP24,This movie is interesting in that it shows you don't have to have the use of all of your body parts to have fun.  Who knew that there was a wheelchair rugby league?  The determination that some of these guys show is amazing.  The loss of limbs doesn't affect their outlook on life at all.,1295654400,,288,4.2

2402156,5,B000B5XP24,"As with all great documentaries, this one does many things--detailing an exciting sport unknown to most viewers, undermining some stereotypes about disabilities, and telling a compelling story about interesting people.  I use it in classes, and rank it up with other great documentaries such as Hoop Dreams.
  Potential buyers might want to know that there are two slightly different versions out there.  The PG-13 version has several very small cuts, taking out several instances of the F-word, editing a segment on sex after serious serious injury, and cutting short a flip but powerful comment by Scott Hogsett that some would find offensive.  This should make the documentary more acceptable for high school courses, and even usable in more liberal middle school classes.  For most other viewers, I'd recommend the R-rated version, although there's not a huge difference between the two.",1279497600,,891,5.328571428571428

2402170,5,B000B5XP24,"It's four years since I first saw this movie, and it lingers in my mind as if it had been last week, haunting me. It is definitely in the top 5 on my all time favorite movies list. I find myself recommending it to friends or casual acquaintances on a several times a month since its release whenever movies come up.

It is a documentary written by one of the players in the movie. All competitors are actual quads, no actors anywhere. The film flows seamlessly from background on various participants and how they became wheelchair bound to the action in the incredibly intense competition on the field/court. These guys ask no quarter and sure as hell are not giving any. If you appreciate competition between teams who are in excellent condition (everywhere they can be), well trained and coordinated, functioning like a master craftsman's finely tuned precision machine, you will appreciate the athleticism and competition here.

The characters are real and engaging. The story is compelling and well told. The competition will bring you to the edge of your seat. It all comes together flawlessly to give you a movie that takes you to another world for 88 minutes.

If you don't deal well with violence in athletic competition (nothing gratuitous), you may find this is simply too much for you. However, if you are comfortable watching contact sports like ice hockey, football (soccer), or American football, you will not have a problem. You're dealing with anything but a bunch of pantywaists here. Just because a guy is in a wheelchair does not mean he's fragile.",1256169600,,1568,4.865168539325842
2402171,5,B000B5XP24,"Jack/Joe Bishop is a friend of my family. So when I saw he was in this movie I had to see it. My dad was 16 when Jack broke his neck and I use to watch him play this sport when I was about 8 or 9 years old back in the early 90s at Lake Worth High school. The documentary is hardcore. Murderball by Joe Soares, Keith Cavill, Mark Zupan, Joe Bishop, Andy Cohn.",1244505600,,358,3.7866666666666666
2402172,4,B000B5XP24,"Most documentaries or movies with the handicapped that I have seen fall into one of two categories: 1) Complete fluff where everyone is sympathetic and incredibly inspiring, or 2) Patronizing.  Murderball follows neither lead, and comes up completely humanistic and original.

Essentially it's the story of the US Olympic Wheelchair Rugby team, and their quest to win the gold.  Among their rivals is their most hated enemy: the Canadians.  Within this setup, we see happiness and elation, as well as agony, embarrassment, and frustration.  As if he were cast for the role of confrontational antagonist, the Canadian team is led by Joe Soares, a foul-mouthed former pioneer and legend of US Wheelchair Rugby who many consider a traitor.  He didn't make the US team on his last try-out and he's vulgarly, bitterly protested ever since.  His counterpart is the US superstar Mark Zuban, a somewhat brash player who typifies the younger, aggressive generation, but still manages to become the face of quad-rugby, inspiring others through seminars and discussions.

Given that the documentary is named Murderball, I expected much more action and many more brutal hits from the armored wheelchairs that are used during competition.  There isn't nearly enough focus given to the sport itself.  Instead, the drama surrounding personal lives was the true focus, a borderline voyeuristic look into the players' lives.  There were no corners cut, nor were there falsehoods.  Those who are quadriplegic can find love and happiness, and will almost inevitably face further life difficulties.  What struck me was the balance between positive traits and negative flaws, where one can be humble yet heroic, and another could be internally frail yet outwardly, defiantly strong.

It's a great character study and very compelling.  It achieves its purpose: showing that the quad rugby players are just like us ""normal"" people.  I highly recommend it.",1222646400,2,1932,5.285245901639344
2402173,5,B000B5XP24,"When you think of quad rugby (rugby played by quadrapolegics) what do you think of? What I thought of was a bunch of disabled guys getting together to throw the ball around  for no other reason but that they wouldn't feel sorry for themselves. (It is hard to admit, but that is the vision I had.)

This film - Murderball, which is the original name of ""quad rugby"" - is a mind-changer. And unlike other films portraying people with disabilities, this film does an excellent job in not apologizing for its subject. What do I mean? With many films and shows about people with disabilities, we are supposed to either feel sorry for their subjects, feel sorry that we are feeling sorry for our subjects, or watch a film that ""politely"" deals with the subjects' disabilities.

This film is no good at apologizing and certainly is not polite. It centers around the American and Canadian quad rugby teams as they prepare for the 2004 Athens olympics, and we meet a bunch of guys who, quite frankly, would kick your a** were you to pat them on the head (as we often subconsciously do to wheelchair inhabitants). (One character says, at the beginning, ""What, you won't hit a guy in a chair? Hit me. I'll hit you back."")

We watch the teams - particularly the American team - train for the Olympics. In so doing, we get to peer into their personal lives: they talk about how they became quadrapolegics, how they got turned on to rugby, and even - cough - frank discussion about how they have sex (I told you this was not a typical polite ""disability"" film). We see perfections, imperfections, and real, real life.

The film is quite captivating in that we are (a) learning about a sport most of us have never watched or thought we'd watch; (b) learning about people who we've always been interested in but never asked about; and (c) are following an adventure story to see if the always-dominant American team can retain their dominance against a very-hungry Candadian team. All three of these factors are equally integrated into the film and one never feels like the film is subsumed by any one of them. Guys. Sports. Paralysis. An interesting triangle, but one which works here.

See the film. I guarantee that you will think of see quad rugby - I'm sorry, murderball - in the same way again.",1215734400,,2284,4.599508599508599

I expected it to be 11 on a nu metal scale of 1-10, which still left room for unintentional funny. But I was surprised by the realness and heart the film Murderball has. I honestly could describe it as touching. Touching.",1215561600,,544,4.190476190476191
2402175,5,B000B5XP24,This was the best documentary I've ever seen. i have seen many sports films and this is at the top of my list. The whole USA vs Canada spin really makes the whole thing exciting.

2402176,5,B000B5XP24,"Great, great, great.  I learned the true definition of ""quadraplegic"".  These guys are not into any ""pity party"".  The MurderBall name comes from the fact that they go all out on the court; trying to win. This film is  entertaining,first of all.  If you want it to be inspiring and/or educational it can be that also.  Highly recommend for any and everyone.",1209859200,,357,4.67741935483871
2402177,5,B000B5XP24,"The wonderful thing about documentaries is that they often introduce us to worlds we didn't even know existed.  For example, before ""March of the Penguins"" came out, how many of us knew about the strange, dangerous and beautiful world of the Emperor penguin?

The 2005 documentary, ""Murderball"", also introduces us to a new world - the world of hyper-competitive quadriplegic rugby.  Played by quadriplegics in specially-designed wheelchairs, this full-contact sport is the testosterone equivalent of football, soccer, regular rugby, and basketball.  The documentary follows the members of the United States National Quad Rugby team as it prepares for the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece.  It also follows the head coach of Team USA's arch-rival, Team Canada as he prepares them for the same goal.

Hollywood couldn't create a screenplay like this.  The characters are incredible:

Joe Soares, the driven former American quad-rugby star who defected to coach the Canadian team after a squabble with Team USA.  Labeled a ""Benedict Arnold"" by members of the U.S. team, Joe's position as head coach of Team Canada is fuel for the intense rivalry between the two teams.

Mark Zupan, the goateed and tattooed former collegiate soccer star who was thrown from the back of his best friend's truck into a canal where he remained, with a broken neck, for 14 hours before being rescued.

Christopher Igoe, Mark Zupan's best friend, who didn't know Zupan was asleep in the back of his truck when he crashed.  Igoe was uninjured in the crash while Zupan was paralyzed.

Bob Lujano, a quadruple amputee, who lost his arms below the elbows and legs above the knees after a bout with a rare form of meningitis.

Rounding out the cast are Andy Cohn, a bleach-blonde injured in a car accident as a teenager and Scott Hogsett, who became a quadriplegic at age 19.

The spirit of these men is inspiring.  They are cheerful, rambunctious, optimistic and burn with competitive spirit.  It's a blast to hang out with them as they train and hang out.  Their cockiness and self-assurance are contagious and women flock to them.  Each man tells the story of his life, how he became injured and how he struggled with adapting to his new condition.  For each of them, quad rugby was their salvation.  Not only were they able to compete again, but they did it in the company of men with similar circumstances.

The story of Joe Soares provides an interesting counterpoint as it shows his relationship with his wife and family.  Particularly poignant is Joe's relationship with his youngest son, Robert.  Unlike his father, Robert is not athletic or even interested in sports.  Instead, he is academic and plays the violin.  It's obvious that Joe is disappointed that Robert is not more like him but as the movie progresses, the relationship between father and son is transformed.

""Murderball"" also follows the story of Keith Cavill, a recently injured quadriplegic.  Injured in a motocross accident, Keith struggles with losing the use of his limbs.  According to the documentary, the first two years are the toughest as quadriplegics go through therapy and learn to do simple tasks such as dressing themselves and moving around.  During this time, people still cling to the hope that they will ""walk again"" although few ever do.  We see evidence of all of this in Keith's recovery.

The movie had some genuinely emotional moments, made more striking because of their sincerity.  The people in this movie are not professional actors reading a script designed to provoke certain responses from the audience.  They are real people acting in real ways.  I doubt if anyone can remain dry-eyed throughout the entire film.

The movie climaxes in a showdown at the 2004 Paralympics.  I won't give away who wins, but I promise that you will be on the edge of your seat.

It is extremely difficult for Americans with full use of their limbs to imagine what it would be like to be a quadriplegic.  If anything ever happened to me to put me in that condition, I'd like to think that I would be able to handle it but I'm afraid I would not.  After watching ""Murderball"", I can take comfort in knowing that it is not only possible to accept such unfortunate circumstances, but also rise above them, to become larger than life, and to accomplish great things.

Highly recommended.

2402202,5,B000B5XP24,"Rugby is a violent, yet fascinating sport that makes American football look like a bunch of teenagers playing with a nurf ball.  Many Americans take pride in the game of American football and consider it the most manly of sports.  For those that do, they've never seen or played in a rugby game.  Rugby is kind of like American football, except without the pads.  The game has been popular internationally for years (especially in countries that once were ruled by the British crown) and is slowly gaining in popularity in the U.S.

MURDERBALL is a documentary about a bunch of Americans who play rugby at the highest level.  That in itself makes for a fascinating documentary.  But the best part is that the players featured in MURDERBALL aren't ordinary players: each one of the players is a quadriplegic who plays in their wheelchair.  I've seen some games of rugby and played in a couple of pick-up games, but those games are tame compared the games shown in MURDERBALL.  These guys play a vicious and hardcore game.

The film follows some of the most prominent members of the U.S. Team over a two-year period, from 2002-2004 between international competitions.  The film examines some of the players' routines, their family lives, and what they do besides playing ""murderball"".  They talk openly about their injuries, their sex lives, and how they started playing the game.

The film tries to follow several different players, but it focuses on two particular individuals who are the defining personalities of the story.  On the one hand there is Mark Zupan.  Zupan is one of the bigger stars of the American team.  Zupan is cocky, brazen, rough, and defiant.  In many ways he is the stereotype of the typical American jock.  Contrasted with Zupan is Joe Soares.  Soares is a legend in the sport.  He is bull-headed and has a nasty temper, but he is a master of the game as well as being a devoted father and husband.  Early in the film Soares is hoping to be hired to coach the American team, but when he is passed over for someone else, he accepts an offer from Team Canada to be the coach of their team.  Many of the American players, including Zupan, consider Soares departure a betrayal and view him as a traitor to his country.  But things aren't that simple, Soares is a man who loves the sport and is willing to do anything to stay involved; it is his passion.

There are three games of murderball that the film shows which happen in the three acts of the film's framework.  The first game happens at the beginning of the film, the second near the middle, and the final game (between Team USA and Team Canada) happens towards the end.  The games themselves are fascinating to watch, but they are the more compelling because of knowing who some of the players are and part of the drama and story of their lives.

I found MURDERBALL to be a fascinating film about a fascinating story and I highly recommend it.

2402205,5,B000B5XP24,"`Murderball,' deservedly nominated for the Oscar's Best Documentary (Features) category, features quadriplegics who play rugby in custom-made wheelchair. They call it quad rugby - you know, sponsors would not like it called `murderball' - but probably this unofficial name would be more appropriate to describe the tension and excitement of watching the players do full-contact rugby on the court, hitting their chariot-like wheel chair against another player's which often tips over, even breaking neck.

The documentary covers the life of select group of quadriplegics during two years 2002-2004. The film records their private life, introducing their family and loves, but the most memorable part of the film would be the heated rivalry between Team American and Team Canada. America's player Mark Zupan, who reminds us of candid punk rockers, makes a great contrast with Team Canada's coach Joe Soares, formerly member of Team USA, who went to Canada after the break-up with the team.

Some American players hate Joe, and reveal candidly their feelings about him before the camera, which is quite understandable. Their hard-nosed attitudes are genuine one as you witness during the three games between Canada and USA. The games become more thrilling to watch because of their joy and disappointment, which are really moving. It sounds like a story made for Hollywood movies. but this story has more truths in it because of the people the film captures.

The film shows their flaws, even their personal demons, but not in condescending way. `Murderball' is not just about the sports; it is a success because it shows the people. And you may not believe me, but it is sometimes funny, too.",1166572800,,1691,5.186813186813187
2402206,5,B000B5XP24,"Murderball is a documentary about the US Paralympic Rugby Team and their quest for the 2004 Olympic gold medal, and its also the story of several men, wheelchair-bound for various reasons, from injury to polio, and their struggle to live a normal life in the face of their challenges.  The documentary focuses most closely on one of the star players, Mark Zupan, and the former star player who now coaches the Canadian team and has a strong yearning to beat his former teammates, many of whom consider him a traitor.  Most affectingly, the movie also features the struggles of a newly quadraplegic man who is starting out from the place these athletes once did.  We see him slowly work his way through rehab, learning to use his chair and perform basic tasks all over again.  It's thrilling to see the way he comes to life when he meets Zupan and has his first try in a rugby wheelchair.

I saw the movie several weeks ago but it has stayed with me, particularly the story of the newly injured young man and the glimpse of Iraq vets in rehab taking their first stab at wheelchair rugby.  While the drama of the medal quest is exciting and suspenseful, the parts I remember are the private glimpses into these men's lives:  the slow and painstaking process of dressing and getting in and out of the chair, the discussions of whether and how ""quads"" have sex, the relationships between the men and their loved ones.  It was an exciting and eye-opening movie.

This fascinating documentary will put all of that stuff into perspective for you, while entertaining the hell out of you at the same time.

Played on a regulation-sized basketball court (minus the baskets), Murderball is actually a slang name for Wheelchair Rugby, an international sport in which quadriplegics use their specially armored wheelchairs almost like souped-up bumper cars to score goals for their team.  The film concentrates, primarily, on the intense and sometimes downright vicious rivalry between the team from the United States and the team from Canada.  The moviemakers introduce us to about a half dozen players, each of whom, even in the few moments afforded him on screen, becomes a distinct personality with a history to relate and a story to tell.  The two main focal points are the charismatic and muscular Mark Zupan, and Joe Soares, one of the legendary pioneers of the sport who left to coach for Canada after he was cut from the American team.  Many of the most incisive scenes deal with the ribbing, some of it good-natured, some of it not so good-natured, that Soares has had to endure over his decision to defect to the opposing side.

Although the rugby scenes themselves are gripping and thrilling, the real drama occurs off the court in the men`s personal lives, as we see the struggle and heartbreak the men go through, the strength and inspiration they exhibit for the rest of us, and, most especially, the camaraderie and team spirit that comes with working together to achieve a common goal.  As the filmmaking crew follows the men around through the course of their daily lives, we get to know them as complex individuals, finding out how they ended up in a wheelchair and seeing how each was able to rise above the experience to get to where he is today.  The film neither sugarcoats the difficulties of their lives nor asks for our pity.  It simply presents the men to us, in all their virtues and flaws, and asks that we listen in on their stories.  Some of the most poignant moments involve Soares having to come to terms with having a son who has little or no interest in sports, preferring the violin instead.

Kudos to directors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro for their fine work on this film, especially Rubin, who also provided the stunning camerawork for the scenes on the court.  But most of our thanks should go to the men of the film and their loved ones who were willing to open up their lives to us in so vivid and honest a way.  This is an inspiring and heartwarming film - the final scene is of some of the men introducing the sport to a number of injured Iraq War veterans - that will stick with you long after the closing credits.",1152748800,4,2919,4.67578125

Five of my eight kids walk, three of them need the assistance of wheelchairs. All of them have watched (or will when they are old enough) ""Murderball"". It is an excellent glimpse into lives affected by change in mobility, and it DOES change your life. The men in this documentary maintain their inner core though. They don't suddenly become docile creatures, grateful for every nugget of kindness thrown their way. This might terrify people who are afraid to approach people in wheelchairs, fearful to offend. But I hope it does the opposite. I hope it encourages them to speak to us in the same way they would anyone else. Always assume we are bright, mature people with a sense of humor about our situations--but still angry that we are in wheelchairs, at least to some extent.

The men and the film stay away from dwelling on the sympathetic element of what has happened in their lives and builds suspence about their goal for a gold medal for the U.S. team.  The additional side plot of dissonance between a former player/coach who now coachs for the American team' chief opponent is not as well played out but adds some depth to the story.

2402221,3,B000B5XP24,"Murderball (Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro, 2005)

What is there to say about Murderball that hasn't already been said? (Plenty, actually, but none of it belongs in a review.) It's a movie-- a documentary-- about a bunch of guys who play quad rugby, AKA murderball. It's coarse, nasty, brutish, violent, and I enjoyed every second of it.

The word most bandied about on the DVD case is ""inspirational,"" and honestly, I have to say I didn't get that at all. Fascinating, yes, but not inspirational; one of Mark Zupan's friends comments at his high school reunion that ""he was an [censored] before the chair, so you can't blame it on the chair."" When it comes right down to it, while Zupan is the most flamboyant of the people portrayed in this film, and thus gets much of the screen time, what you're not going to find in this movie is too many people who are no more sympathetic than Zupan. It's quite doubtful you'll like any of these folks; the ones who seem as if they may be likable (Zupan's girlfriend, Joe Soares' kid) are pushed off to the side, only appearing in the movie now and again in order to illustrate some larger point about the film's actual subjects. Can you see the manipulation? Of course you can, but this is a documentary; in an age when Michael Moore can call his movies ""documentaries"" and get away with it, you should expect it.

All that said, you will love to hate these people. Just because someone isn't likable doesn't mean he's not interesting (after all, would the History Channel exist if not for the life of Adolf Hitler?). These guys are fun to watch, pure and simple.

The movie does fall short a number of times in technical aspects. I wondered a number of times why a documentary that ran less than ninety minutes seemed to need to edit out so much of the actual games they played; the footage remaining tends to be confusing at best. A number of people have complained in various discussions I have read about the movie that it was impossible to tell what was going on during the matches, and I have to agree with them.

Still, when the movie focuses on the players, it's fun stuff. Not world-changing, not great, but fun. Worth watching. ***",1145577600,5,2190,4.534177215189874

2402227,5,B000B5XP24,"MURDERBALL, simply put, is a bunch of quadriplegics in wheelchairs playing full-contact Rugby on a sort of basketball court. But the movie is much more than that simplistic notion.

MURDERBALL the movie is a voyage of discovery, telling its characters (the men in these wheelchairs) that life isn't over after a debilitating accident. And telling us, those who are fortunate enough not to be stuck in these chairs, that they've earned our respect, not our sympathies.

This amazingly little known Paralympic sport is taken very seriously by the U.S. team, who've taken home the gold the past 11 times. Their specialized chairs are turned into battering rams for plowing into their fellow players (the speed at which they can travel are impressive and the impacts at the end ear-throttling).

Mark Zupan is one of this documentary's focuses, a quadriplegic with serious attitude, huge biceps, a scowling face, dark tattoos, and, underneath it all, a heart of gold. Having been paralyzed after an accident caused by his best friend from high school, Christopher Igoe, the two have not spoken in years ...out of guilt, fear, and anger. But as the film winds down we see a softening in attitude on Mark Zupan's part and the two come together in an offish but very touching way.

The other main focus of the documentary is on Joe Soares, a bitter man who lost his position on team America and now spins his Rugby wheels for the Canadian team ...as their coach. Sparks fly as the two teams meet up for the first time since Joe Soares took over the Canadian team. Joe is also so caught up in what he's doing that he forgets to remember the most important things in his life: his wife and son. At first, I absolutely hated Joe. But as the film rolled on, and some changes in Joe's life were forced upon him, I began to understand his position. The viewer also gets to see Joe grow out of his self-centeredness and into a more loving father and husband.

The final focus is on a young man named Kevin, who is newly acquainted with a wheelchair after becoming a quadriplegic from a motorcycle accident. He's bitter, angry, depressed, all the things you'd expect after suffering such a horrific life-change. But Mark Zupan introduces him to wheelchair Rugby (Murderball) and Kevin is instantly hooked. Life takes on new meaning for Kevin and he obviously decides that his existence still has value. A great set of scenes!

I'll end this review by mentioning the special features that came with the DVD. Johnnie Knoxville and ""Steve-O"" from Jackass the TV series, party with several of the members of the U.S. Paralympic Wheelchair Rugby team and it's a great thing to behold. Not only does it show how amiable these wheelchair-bound guys are, but it also shows us how their chairs don't hold them back in the slightest (punching each other, using cattle prods, and jumping off ramps in their chairs and into swimming pools).",1141948800,3,2913,4.76984126984127

Awseome, awesome documentary that should not be missed & I hope will win the Oscar for best documentary of the year.

""Murderball"" chronicles the U.S. wheelchair rugby team & the finals at the 2004 Paralympic Games, in Athens, Greece. As the film opens, & progresses along the viewer slowly gets to know each member of the team, how they got their disability & how they train to become one of the best ""Murderball"" teams going.

In all sports, their are rivalries & this sport is no different. The rivlary - Team Canada coached by former Team U.S.A. star  Joe Soares. Soares was booted off the team because of his age, which was slowing down his speed in the game. Soares was offered a coaching position on Team Canada & accepted (after all, it was a good job that kept him in the sport). However, for Team U.S.A. its desertion of country & bitterness & a rivalry is born.

""Murderball"" is the best film about living with a disability I've ever seen. These guys have the disability, the disabilty doesn't have them.

The sport itself is a bit confusing to watch at first, but, once the rules are explained in the film, it's pretty cool to watch.

One of the most most touching parts of the film is when Mark Zupan goes on a scout trip looking for new players & finds Keith Cavill a young kid who is trying to come to grips with being a parapelegic stemming from a motorcross accident. The film introduces Keith early on in the film & I knew he was going to fit in the film somewhere, & when Keith learns about the game from Mark you know he's going to be the newest member on the team (be sure to check out the special features of the N.Y. premiere, you won't be dissapointed).

We also meet a young man in a rehab facility who has just had a spinal cord injury and see him excited for the first time at the thought of playing wheelchair rugby.

2402241,5,B000B5XP24,"""Murderball"" is a essentially a sports movie that balances the parts about the game and its athletes with some lessons in what life is like for quadriplegics. That's because the sport is quad rugby. Invented in the 1970s in Canada and originally called ""murderball"", quad rugby is wheelchair sport  played by quadriplegics, people with impairment of varying degrees in all four limbs. To score, players must wheel into the end zones while in possession of the ball. They get there by passing and carrying. They block their opponents by smashing into them in armored souped-up wheel chairs.  Director Dana Adam Shapiro and cinematographer Henry Alex-Rubin followed 4 of the United States' best quad rugby players from the 2002 Wheelchair Rugby World Championship in Sweden to the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, Greece, as well as Joe Soares, a former U.S. player who left to coach the U.S.' arch-rival Canadian team amid heated accusations of betrayal.

It would have been enough to make a documentary about the sport of quad rugby without trying to be educational. It's an exciting sport that few people are familiar with. But if the filmmakers focus on the athletes, they can't avoid the subject of how much or little physical function the players have, what they can or cannot do. Then the audience, and probably the filmmakers too, begins to wonder: How did these men become disabled? How do they feel about it? What do they do outside of quad rugby? So ""Murderball"" anticipates those questions. We learn about the sport, what it means to these athletes, and how being a quadriplegic has changed their lives -and how it hasn't. ""Murderball"" leaves no nagging curiosity unanswered.

I want to emphasize that ""Murderball"" is not a depressing film. I think is suffered for that misconception at the box office. These athletes are not disabled in the sense that I normally use the word. They are totally independent and can do most routine tasks for themselves, albeit sometimes differently from able-bodied people. People have to be fairly functional to play wheelchair sports; they have to propel the wheelchair. The 5 athletes -Mark Zupan, Scott Hogsett, Andy Cohn, Bob Lujano, and Joe Soares- have strong, vibrant personalities, the type that like to throw themselves into life in a physical way. They're thrilled to be playing a competitive contact sport in spite of their limitations. And their enthusiasm is infectious. And I learned some things about quadriplegics that I didn't know before. These guys are frank and funny and don't hesitate to express their annoyance with the misplaced pity of able-bodied people. ""Murderball"" is a fun film, and these athletes are more interesting than most pro football or basketball stars.

No, this isn't about murder. It's a documentary about the US Wheelchair rugby team, that compete and go to the Paralympics in Athens, Greece in 2004.

The film follows some of the players in their life, how they got to be in a wheelchair, and how they fight to win at the Championships and the Paralympics.

Powerful stuff. You'll laugh - you'll cry. I did. Plus, not only fun, it's educational.

First, we meet Mark, a cutie pie tough guy with tats and attitude. He introduces us to the game. We later meet his girlfriend, parents, and best buddy from high school.

Other men on the team, all adorable, strong, very nice men, all working for the goal of the big win. All with stories of their own.

These men are strong, courageous, daring, fearless, and inspirational.

I recommend this to kids over 10 or 12, and anyone that may be feeling sorry for themselves. My dear Norman has a limp, from a gunshot wound (back in his CIA days.. long story..) he's a good man, but, like men do, he feels a bit sorry for himself, just once in a while. So, I bought this DVD, made popcorn, and we watched it last night.

I don't know if he got my point, but, he seemed to enjoy it. Men and their sports, you know. My point was - if you don't know by now - is that when you feel you have it bad, there is always someone that has it worse. So, stop complaining! I especially liked the young man with no arms or legs, to illustrate my point. He was sweet, a great player, and self-sufficient at home. No laying around crying for him!!

The reason I say, good for kids, older kids that is, a LOT of swearing - don't be shocked, but for kids to learn about disabled people is a good thing. To learn to care about others, to have compassion, and to not be afraid of the disabled or handicapped. I don't want my kids so overprotected that they can't handle real life.

The filmmakers never preach in this film.  They present reality as reality. They give us slices of the players' lives, their loves, their foibles.  They shot the film from the viewpoint of sitting in a wheelchair; it is an intimate look at what the view is from there.  We see the struggle putting clothes on, rolling over, tackling a task such as taking your shoes off.  We get to experience the laughter and the joy of finding out that you can still enjoy sex, and the casts' surprisingly good humor about the endless fascination some females have for men in wheelchairs.  We also see how self-sufficient is a man who can hustle himself and all his equipment through an airport; for whom international travel has become a reality and a frequent opportunity at the highest echelons of the sport.  The directors concentrate on what makes a team a team, and how team pride, at this level, uplifts to pride in the country you play for.  There's some brief explanation of the rules of wheelchair rugby, but mostly you get the feel of the action by watching slices of the USA's matches against their arch-rivals, the Canadian team.  Particularly telling is a feature that shows the amount of points a team can have on the floor at any one moment.  Players are ranked by the ""deepness"" of their disability with 1-3 points.  No team can have more than 8 points on the floor at once.  A revelation.

We also get to see those unique personalities that abound in every sport at the highest level of play....Mark Zuban, a true hotshot in every aspect of what that word means.  He's mean, he's brutally honest, in fantastic condition and the heart of Team USA.  Despite his outward cockiness and bravado, he takes the time to talk about his sport to groups of the newly disabled...in a matter of fact, interesting way, that is its own uplift.

There's a bit of a sidetrack in Mark's story, where he is reconciled with his best friend, the driver who caused him to fly from a vehicle and sustain his life threatening injuries.

It's not a bad story, but probably the weakest link in the film.

Joe Soares is Zuban's  antithesis, but is he?  Unarguably the greatest player in the world, Joe was sidelined by Team USA as he got older and bitterly began to coach for Canada (although he lives in Tampa, Florida).  Joe's opinionated, pushy, and a family man.  We get to see him and his disdain for his son (who is a ""non-athlete"" and musician) before he has a heart attack, and the change in him after the heart attack leaves him feeling rather mortal.  Joe never becomes a villain.  We understand why Team USA is upset about his new allegiance, we understand why Joe did what he did.  We can see his coaching skill in the way that his Canadian players respond to him.  Joe is tough love personified.

When the teams and players are cemented in your mind, the directors introduce Keith Cavill, who has been newly introduced to the world of the quadriplegic.  It is through Keith's story that we see how far these men have come; how daunting is the world when you are first forced to realize what kinds of challenges you will face for the rest of your life.  Without giving you an emotional bath, the filmmakers show you what happens to Keith's mindset when he's first introduced to the world of quad rugby, and how it changes his perspective.

There are not enough fine words of praise for the crafting that went into this film, for the ""acting"" of the principals, for the tone, the camerawork, the script, the editing.  The DVD features are outstanding for a documentary, and should not be missed, with perhaps the exception of the feature from the TV show ""Jackass"".  This year, in feature length documentaries, Murderball goes up for the Oscar against what was a wonderful film, ""March of the Penguins"".  But as good as ""March"" was, there is no question that this is the documentary film, indeed perhaps the film, of the year.

2402244,4,B000B5XP24,"This film taught a lot.  It taught how stupid (usually alcohol-related) accidents in your youth can turn your world upside down, but it also taught how to come to terms with tragedy and remain true to yourself and your desires.  These guys don't let their disabilities keep them on the sidelines, or keep them from finding girlfriends who would probably be a ""catch"" in anyone's book.  They never sell themselves short.  I think this would be a great film to show kids, to teach them to never judge people in wheelchairs and to treat everyone the same... all that good stuff.  But, it is totally inappropriate for young viewers because of all the profanity and the bit about quadripelgic sex.  It is a shame to me that a film with such an uplifting and important message has an R rating.  But I still very much enjoyed this documentary.",1139875200,4,836,4.608108108108108
2402245,5,B000B5XP24,"This powerful documentary should serve as an antidote to anyone who ever felt uncomfortable around a person in a wheelchair.  The individuals profiled, all participants in the full-contact sport of wheelchair rugby, are independent and demand to be regarded without pity.  They are fierce competitors in a grueling sport, going for the gold in the Paralympics in a 12-country competition.

Although several people are featured, the central figures are Marc Zupan and Joe Soares.  Marc is currently among the top players in the sport, a charismatic man whose zest for life will not be diminished.  Joe, a former superstar, is at first bitter about the way age has robbed him of his skills; a dramatic and unexpected development midway through the film seems to transform the way he looks at life and his relationship with his son.

2402263,5,B000B5XP24,"This is a fast-paced riveting documentary about young men who have through accidents, blood poisoning, and other mishaps, find themselves mangled quadriplegiacs. Mentally, life is even tougher as they must deal with people's condescending pity and ignorance. Where do they find belonging and a sense of worth? In a special rugby game with wheelchairs, these young men find a reason to live. They are genuine warriors who find in this intense, often violent competition, a sense of purpose and regain the spark of life they once had.

The rivalry between the Canadian and USA team has all the drama of a real movie. But the human stories behind the competition are the true masterpiece of this film. We see the machismo coupled with vulnerability and the special, often beautiful women who are drawn to these wheel-chair-riding men.

Anyone feeling sorry for themselves need only see this film of courageous warriors to snap out of their pity party.

Perhaps more than anything this film is about dignity and finding a way to keep one's vitality even in the face of unbearable loss. This elan, moxie, and charisma is so rich in the USA team leader Zupan that he is capable of holding the film on his own, but even better the other character studies are equally compelling.",1135900800,2,1271,4.875

2402265,5,B000B5XP24,"This is a sports movie, maybe one of the best sports movies I've ever seen in my life because it manages to tell a completely original story while following the conventions of the typical ""Will our team win the championship?"" drama. Because it is a documentary about violent, full-contact indoor rugby between paralyzed men in armored wheelchairs, of course, MURDERBALL had trouble finding much of an audience this summer, despite good reviews, and that is a real shame. While building excitement as the United States team goes up against its bitter Canadian rival for the Paralympics gold medal in Athens, the film also shows us the stories of several team members, telling how they came to be paralyzed and how they deal with their paralysis day-to-day. The stories aren't always sympathetic, and the whole film isn't designed to tug at your heartstrings. Instead, you get frank, occasionally hilarious stories from the guys about sex, women, alcohol, bar fights, tattoos and a love for the sport. Beyond that, the film also addresses how a man with no hands can hold a slice of pizza. The film even has great characters, giving us heroes like USA team captain Mark Zupan and a villain named Joe Soares, a former member of the USA team who now coaches the evil Canadians and ignores his own awkward, adolescent son. Given the oddness of the film's topic, a lot of people may be reluctant to try this movie, but this documentary was the most brazenly fun film I saw all year.",1135728000,,1476,4.792156862745098

2402269,5,B000B5XP24,"I agree with the people featured in the film when they say that this is a sports story and not a pity story about handicapped people.

Murderball follows the US National Quad rugby team over a couple years and focuses on 1. the players and how they got to where they are and 2. the US rivalry with Canada's team.

The first point of focus shows how the players ended up in their wheelchairs. One man was infected with a rare bacteria in his childhood and lost most of his arms and his legs, one was thrown off of a deck, one was thrown from a truck and was not found for almost 14 hours.

A couple of non team members are also highlighted. Joe Soares, an ex US star, who was Canada's head coach (many hard feelings there) had polio and Keith, a recently injured young man, was in a motocross accident.

All of the individuals chose to overcome their difficulties to succeed and end up doing things that they would not have done otherwise. It is interesting to see the team at the top of their game cntrasted with Keith who is relearning how to do things only four months after his accident.

The second point of focus follows the bad blood between team USA and Canada's team that stems from Joe Soares's being cut from the US team due to old age and slowness, attempting to sue the US team and then taking a head coach position for Canada. It seems his sole goal in life is to beat the US team. The US team, Mark Zupan in particular, detest Soares and the tension makes for a great rivalry.

The film itself is fantastic and the special features are very good. A follow up interview with Soares, an hour Larry King interview, player and filmaker commentaries and behind the scenes featurette are all worth watching.

The sole extra that I could have done without is the one with the guys from MTV's Jackass. These guys are untalented idiots and are very difficult to watch.",1134345600,,1873,4.380403458213256

8082041,2,B000B5XP24,"In Alan Clarke's memorable movie SCUM (1979), the inmates of a young person offender's prison play Murderball on a basketball court. A game sans any real rules, it provides the chance for them to vent their frustrations through legitimized violence: anything goes, apparently.

Filmed in the early years of this century, Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro's documentary makes similar claims for the game of wheelchair rugby. Also played on a basketball, the game offers the chance for young quadriplegics to express their aggressive instincts in a sport that might have its own set of rules but seems extremely violent, much more so than rugby for able-bodied players.

The action follows the fortunes of the American team, which had won most of the major tournaments prior to the film's beginning, but failed to win the World Championship held in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2002. The film examines the team's preparations for the Athens Paralympics two years later, while profiling the struggles of many team members to deal with their disability as well as learn how to become successful members of a match-winning unit.

We have to admire the sheer dogged persistence of many of the young men featured in the documentary, as they negotiate the almost daily struggles to maintain their self-esteem, as well as improving their rugby abilities through training. Success is essential for any team; but perhaps more so for the wheelchair rugby unit. What the players achieve over the time-period covered by the film is, quite simply, wonderful.

And yet, and yet ... The film also shows the subjects trying to conform to the aggressively masculine identities associated with rugby players: tough, uncompromising, sexist. Anyone who has played the game to any standard knows that such stereotypes are found everywhere. Yet rugby has evolved a lot over the last two decades: sophisticated training methods have discovered the importance of less aggressive behavioral forms, for example, trying to understand the opposition's psychology without trying to bash the living daylights out of them. Players have now been encouraged to look into themselves and admit their shortcomings in public, or (better still) acknowledge their sexualities. That does not make them any less brilliant on the field; in fact, such strategies can even improve their performance.

What spoils MURDERBALL is the directors' reluctance to think of rugby as anything else other than a violent, aggressively male sport. It isn't; women's rugby is as popular both for able-bodied as well as disabled players. As Clint Eastwood's film INVICTUS (2009) has also shown, it is a game whose significance extends far beyond the field, as it becomes a means by which individuals can deal with trauma. Would that MURDERBALL had taken a little time out from its obsession with violence and examined that aspect of the game.",1471046400,,2879,5.196120689655173
