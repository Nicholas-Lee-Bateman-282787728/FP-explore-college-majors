8431626,3,B004J4RR22,"So I'm a huge fan of Juvenile Orion and I was so excited to finally purchase this, but uh...the boys are cute and all but it's kind of easy to tell that most of these actors are new and and the ending is disappointing and will leave you with staring at your TV saying ""W-wait, that's the end?! It just started getting interesting!""

Take note that it's REALLY different than the manga and really the only thing similar to it is the character's names and the factions, although they really only bring up the Darklore, Erasers and EGO, completely ignoring the others. If you are a big fan of the manga, I'd recommend ONLY buying this if you are open-minded and are not expecting it to be anything like the manga.

It's nice to have as a collecting piece at least.",1381795200,,761,4.390070921985815
8431627,2,B004J4RR22,I've seen the series & this just didn't live up to it. It wasn't completely horrible but it was seriously lacking in some parts.,1373760000,,128,4.375
