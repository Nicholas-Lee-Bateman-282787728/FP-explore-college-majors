7931252,4,B000055XTK,"I've been an I Spy fan for nearly 30 years, since seeing it in repeats in the early 70s, and the show is hard to find on broadcast television -- cable or otherwise. In short, this is a great DVD for fans of the series, spy genre or action shows. The DVD rocks. It's clear and the color is vibrant. That's not always the case on some DVDs or VHS releases on TV shows. Also, there's no translucent company logo that pops up on the screen. A big plus, because some companies do that too.  The release order seems to be following most of the shows from the first season of I Spy. Hopefully, the company will release all the episodes. If there's any drawback it's the lack of ""extras"" that many DVDs come with, but that's not a true need for something like this, just a nice to have.",982022400,6,778,4.1866666666666665
