8457351,3,B00553K8TU,"If you are wondering where actors went in the Newman/Redford years the answer lies in films like ""Assignment to Kill,"" that would have been easily handled by James Coburn or George Peppard. This condemned-to-airline film directed and written by Sheldon Reynolds (is that a wrap?) starts out like another Harry Palmer vehicle but then it never seems to reach inertia. It has all the marks of another ""Charade,"" international cast, (Herbert Lom, Eric Portman, john Gielgud) European locales, the Alps all shot in exquisite color sharply lit, but then what the actors utter falls flat with little wit or flair. It begins when a Richard Cutter (Patrick O'Neal) insurance investigator gets summoned to investigate a mysterious crash involving insurance companies and the dog is on the scent. When he meets Donimique (Joan Hackett) and hooks up with her, he fidgets with cigarettes constantly while the comely Hackett becomes like an annoying sister.(They drop the ball here, seriously) No chance to become another ""Charade."" The director diminishes Hackett's appeal in too many scenes, awkwardly placing her turned away or kneeling away from the audience. (Who cared about Cary Grant's height/age to Audrey Hepburn's). Unpardonable to me, the editor cuts away from Dominique before she finishes her lines throughout drawing attention to The Men like O'Neal who is no Connery here soon to make his mark in Columbo episodes. As the plot turns on Dominique who places herself at risk, she needlessly squabbles with Cutter instead of building teasingly into a satisfying infatuation that warms up the plot as well as the stakes. After all, there is a running tension between the Lom character and Cutter over their ability to decipher the truth; it would have doubled the interest (in a crawling story) with romantic tension, instead the principals quarrel at arm's length like middle schoolers. By the time Dominique vanishes (romance too) only explosive action can redeem this pedestrian intrigue. As if sensing this, Cutter gets serious with some gun play and hurried revelations we must sort out with two dead bodies. It is too bad the director plays it safe with loner Cutter above romantic entanglements reducing all lovely Dominique possibilities to biding time, a dismissive nod to the Women's Movement. Director Reynolds had diamonds in his hands here but left us with rocks. Ugh!",1480464000,,2380,5.184415584415585

8457353,1,B00553K8TU,"""Assignment to Kill"" is a cinematic rarity, a 1968 movie that had ""made for TV"" written all over it but which was unfortunately made at a time when there were no TV movies and not a lot of drive-in movies either. As a result, it had an extremely limited theatrical release until Warner Archive rescued it from the vaults and released it on DVD. It should have stayed in the vaults.

Patrick O'Neal stars in ""Assignment"" as Richard Cutting, an insurance investigator hired to look into the sinking of a couple of cargo ships owned by filthy rich and totally amoral Curt Valayan (John Gielgud). The insurance companies think Valayan ordered the ships sunk but they can't prove it so they hire Cutting. Since O'Neal's skills don't seem to extend to actually conducting an investigation, they give him a big clue: a man they think was involved in the sinking may later have been involved in a plane crash in Switzerland and is now presumed dead. Cutting goes to Switzerland where the first civilian he talks to in a local bar conveniently happens be the missing man's girl friend, Dominique (Joan Hackett), who even more conveniently arranges to have Cutting meet the missing man, who even more conveniently confesses within the first 30 seconds of their conversation to sinking the ships.

Since this movie lasts 100 minutes instead of 30, there have to be some complications, and, sure enough, the presumed dead saboteur turns up for real dead the next morning. There's still no mystery as to what happened; the dead man's employer, Matt Wilson (Herbert Lom), had one of his goons kill the would-be stool pigeon. Of course, Wilson happened to be in the same bar at the same time as Cutting and was introduced to Cutting by Dominique. Given all the help the screenwriters give Cutting, the only real mystery in this movie is how it takes him another hour to get the goods on Wilson and Valayan.

""Assignment to Kill"" was written and directed by Sheldon Reynolds, who did most of his work on television, and he and the producers intended this movie as a stylish suspense film and intended Cutting as something like the Daniel Craig version of James Bond. However, to play Cutting, they cast an actor, Patrick O'Neal, who is distinctly lacking in style, wit, or charm. O'Neal usually played smarmy jerks for a reason. He's completely uncharismatic here and his supposed coldblooded toughness comes across more as arrogant disinterest. The only thing I found intriguing about O'Neal's character was trying to see how far he could let his omnipresent cigarette dangle out of his mouth without it falling to the ground. The screenplay doesn't give O'Neal any help, either, providing him with such cutting retorts as, in response to being asked why he carried a gun, ""It's more effective than a hammer.""

""Assignment to Kill"" is the type of movie in which the garrulous villain loves to have long chats with the hero in which he pretty much tells the hero everything he needs to know, then sits there calmly while the hero keeps insulting him, and then tries to pay off the hero because, really, they're both the same type of person. Herbert Lom was born to play villainous roles like this, but he and Gielgud are pretty much wasted. These ""civilized"" dialogues and the ""witty"" repartee between Lom and O'Neal are the film's substitute for real action. The movie has only one fight scene, a poorly staged brawl between Cutting and Wilson's goon, but for the most part it tries and repeatedly fails to build interest through incessant chatter.

In one regard, ""Assignment"" may well have been ahead of its time, when the script expounds on the evils of multinational corporations that operate above the law because no country can touch them. Unfortunately, that idea is buried deep within a ten minute monologue Lom delivers while eating breakfast with O'Neal one morning. The script also commits a huge blunder when it suggests that Valayan had his ships sunk for the money because he knew he could get away with it. In reality, no successful businessman, no matter how evil, would try to pull off a stunt like that for the simple reason that, even though the insurance companies might to pay up for lack of proof, he would never be able to buy insurance again.

I dislike movies such as ""Assignment"" more than I dislike amateurish garbage because ""Assignment"" wastes the talents and time of a number of solid professionals like Lom, Gielgud, Hackett, Oscar Homolka, and Eric Portman (in what was, sadly, his last film). Had the project come around a few years later, it would have been turned into a ""movie of the week"" that wouldn't have seemed quite so bad. Blown up on the wide screen, however, the sheer emptiness of the movie is much harder to hide.",1407888000,3,4745,4.780487804878049

8457357,4,B00553K8TU,"Assignment to Kill (1968), is a better than average, albeit unspectacular suspense thriller, set in Switzerland.  Moving at a deliberate pace, and featuring some picturesque scenes of the slow covered Alps, the film has a solid cast, which includes Patrick O'Neal, Herbert Lom (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pink-Panther-films/dp/B0001AG01M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pink Panther films</a>), Joan Hackett, Oscar Homolka (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funeral-in-Berlin/dp/B00005KHK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funeral in Berlin</a>), and John Gielgud.

Patrick O'Neal is very good as Richard Cutting, a veteran investigator, who is called in by an American insurance agency, to look into the affairs of shipping tycoon Curt Valayan (Gielgud), who has made some questionable claims.  A man named Walter Green (Peter van Eyck) was about to provide information about Valayan's activities, when his plane crashed in the Alps.

The wreckage of the plane has recently been found on the ski slopes of Switzerland, but Green's body is missing.  Cutting arrives from New York, and follows a lead to Zurich, making contact with Green's former secretary Dominique Laurant (Hackett).  Cutting also encounters Valayan's point man Matt Wilson (Lom), who advises him to keep out of his way.  Green turns out to still be alive, with evidence of Valayan's wrongdoings, but his luck soon runs out.

Cutting teams up with Dominique, as they try to outmaneuver Wilson, and avoid trouble with Inspector Ruff (Homolka) of the police.  Not a man to be trifled with, Wilson employs his hired muscle (Leon Greene), to remove any threat to his employer's interests.  The normally emotionally detached Cutting becomes personally engaged, and formulates a plan to bring down Valayan.

There are just a couple of action scenes, and no tricky gimmicks, as the film relies on investigative work, sharp intelligent dialog, and character development, to set a tone, and generate suspense.  In a tale that is mostly about deception and manipulation, the clever writing is complemented by solid acting, as O'Neal plays an extremely competent low key type, who is finally touched emotionally.  Homolka and Lom, do overplay their roles a little, but in mostly entertaining ways.  Joan Hackett does a nice job as the impetuous innocent, caught up the intrigue, while Leon Greene makes a nasty heavy.  John Gielgud isn't present much, but still adds some class to the proceedings.

Assignment to Kill won't dazzle in any way, but it is a tight, well-grounded mystery adventure, which benefits from William Lava's effective musical score.  Typical for Warner Brothers DVD-R releases, the film is not subtitled, and contains no extra features.  The print shows some signs of dirt and dust, but the movie generally looks quite bright, although the focus is a bit soft in places.",1371081600,,2917,5.682027649769585
8457358,4,B00553K8TU,"I don't have the DVD from Amazon yet, but this is one of my favorite movies, so I am planning to get the DVD also. Parts of the movie are 5*, for my taste, but a couple of the actors didn't resonate as well with me as O'Neal and Homolka did. O'Neal and Homolka were just great, to my taste, and parts of the movie bring back the time and the genre perfectly, again, to my taste. Some of the scenes are just perfect, to my taste (like the early scene with O'Neal and the Swiss police officer :) Probably worth a look if you like the genre from that period.",1371081600,,555,4.009009009009009
8457359,4,B00553K8TU,"Well-known TV actor Patrick O'Neal gets a turn at big-screen leading man in 1968's 'Assignment to Kill,' portraying no-nonsense, whip-smart private investigator Richard Cutting with a natural, laconic self-possession generally associated with A-list mavericks like Mitchum, Marvin, Coburn and (during the period) Sinatra.  The storyline, involving an insurance-scam-turned-murder-plot, is intelligent enough; the cast of international familiars, including Herbert Lom, Peter van Eyck, Eric Portman, Oskar Homolka and John Gielgud, are convincingly duplicitous enough; and the locations, shot in and around Geneva, Switzerland, are exotic enough to keep both fans of Bond and Hitchcock pleasanty entertained.  The Warner Archive DVD-R offers no extras but features a clean non-anamorphic widescreen print with good color and sound that, aside from a few minor artifacts, has aged gracefully.  Film rates 4-minus stars, presentation/price 3-plus.",1348704000,4,944,6.246153846153846
