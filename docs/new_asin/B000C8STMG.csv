2453955,3,B000C8STMG,"It is not the big karate of the year, but it has very nice karate moves. Its the story of a boy trying to build his confidence, by searching the power within the ring, which a  karate master gave to him. If you are  looking for a high tech movie, this is not the one you are looking for.",913680000,7,287,3.847457627118644

8096373,3,B000C8STMG,"This here's the first film adolescent karate star Ted Jan Roberts starred in after beginning the ""Masked Rider"" TV show, and his first feature following the same year's superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Dangerous-Place/dp/B00009V7SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Dangerous Place</a>. ""The Power Within"" isn't a bad movie but it's far from great - more of a middle-of-the-road thing, mixing magic and martial arts on a B-movie's budget with unsteady results. There's an interesting cast here and some decent fight scenes, but for all this one's potential, it still sort of comes up short.

The story: when one of two ancient, magic rings comes into the possession of a timid high schooler (Roberts), he acquires not only impressive new abilities but also an adversary in a dangerous thief seeking the ring (William Zabka,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid</a>).

The screenplay by PM Entertainment regular Joe Hart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steel-Frontier/dp/B00009V7SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steel Frontier</a>) is a bit problematic. I don't think it's very effective in getting its point across. The lesson it imparts is that you ought to fulfill your potential, something which Ted's character eventually learns he can do even without magic jewelry, but the setups used to illustrate this are unrealistic and unfair. Prior to acquiring the ring, Ted gets chastised by everyone from his martial arts instructor (Michael DePasquale,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Heat/dp/B000QFAFMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Heat</a>) to his little brother (the kid from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evening-Shade/dp/B00005JOXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evening Shade</a>) for getting beaten up by no less than five bullies, and after he gets the ring, a teacher challenges him with ridiculously complex history questions as though purposely trying to make him fail. Later he's arrested for beating up a load of goons in self-defense. Lighten up, folks!

Gerald Okamura (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weapons-of-Death/dp/B000MTFDGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weapons of Death</a>), the wise old man Ted receives his ring from, plays a pretty strange character who introduces the inexplicable magical feats seen in the movie (e.g. teleporting, projecting visions, shooting explosive lightning), but I don't mind him since he delivers what might be the best fight scene of the movie, using smooth kung fu to take on a group of thugs. This is one of the few fights unmarred by unnecessary editing, which hurts the remaining six brawls to varying degrees. They're still watchable, especially the one wherein Ted gets back at the aforementioned bullies, but disappointingly, the worst fight is also the most important one: the final showdown between Ted and William Zabka. Zabka's fun to watch throughout the movie, with his crazy sunglasses and English accent, and by all means it should be intriguing to see him antagonize another karate kid, but it's all for naught when their only battle is a short, one-sided little thing that takes place in front of an unconvincing backdrop. I've definitely seen better.

Not unlike Roberts' previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magic-Kid/dp/B0002S64WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magic Kid</a>, a good portion of the film takes place in and acts as a pseudo-advertisement for the Universal Studios theme park, which is fun in a campy and corny way.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Room-222/dp/B001LRL4Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Room 222</a>'s Karen Valentine is interesting as Ted's onscreen mother, and there's a lot of enjoyable weirdness throughout the film, like the unexplained presence of a chimpanzee in Gerald Okamura's house and Ted's inexplicable ninja dream. However, it's not crazy enough to be great on that leg alone, and as a fantasy/martial arts flick it doesn't deliver entirely either. If this sounds like your kind of thing, go for it, but I've seen better from the boy action hero.",1361836800,5,4369,6.646234676007006
8096374,5,B000C8STMG,This movie came in very fast and it's in great condition. I will order from this person again. Thanks!!,1264550400,,103,4.473684210526316
8096375,4,B000C8STMG,"This is one of my favorite TJ Roberts films by far and I'll start with the things I like being the choreography. TJ really delivers when he puts one the rings of power on. William Zabka plays the bad guy ( something he does well) you might know him from movies like the karate kid or just one of the guys. Well he possess the other ring which he stole in attempts to gain the one that was given unto TJ's character. The rings of power increases what is already inside of a person but to have them both is to make a person nearly invincible. ""The best explaination for all things is time"" a quote you'll learn as the story develops. I'm grading this according to quality of acting and delivering for a martial arts movie. Its worth getting if you like martial arts movies that the family can watch together.",1229817600,5,806,4.309210526315789
8096376,5,B000C8STMG,I like this movie.  Billy Zabka is wonderful actor and smiles lot.,1146096000,,66,4.5
