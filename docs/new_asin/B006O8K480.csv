8501694,5,B006O8K480,"When you order a DVD that has one or two works you want and find that another work on it is a real winner, that's serendipity, and that's what this video of the Berlin Philharmonic in their summer venue at the Waldbuhne had for me. I wanted Respighi's Fountains of Rome and Pines of Rome. I got them and was pleased that both the performances and the recording are first-rate. (Some of the earlier BPO recordings at the Waldbuhne have distinctly mediocre sound.) The bonus is Riccardo Chailly's high-spirited performance of Shostakovich's charming Suite No. 2 for Jazz Orchestra, which is a complete contrast to his dark major works. Nino Rota's ""La Strada"" ballet suite adds little to the program (in my opinion), but the crowd-pleasing Berliner Luft, by Lincke, at the closing, wraps up the program on a note of good cheer.",1502409600,,825,4.776223776223776

8501697,5,B006O8K480,"I'm so grateful for EuroArts Blu-rays that perfectly capture exceptional orchestral performances most of us would otherwise never have the chance to experience, much less re-experience. Just how difficult it is to achieve this level of perfection is evident when you watch a Blu-ray like the one of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Symphonies-Nos-4-6-Blu-ray/dp/B005HK8KXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: Symphonies Nos. 4-6 [Blu-ray</a>]. No matter how stellar the performance is, when the visual quality and direction are inferior (as they are on that disc), the magic is lost and you might as well be listening to a CD.

EuroArts' sources don't always get it right either. For example, inconsistent camerawork mars&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Achucarro-Rattle-Nights-in-The-Gardens-of-Spain-Blu-ray/dp/B0055ISAHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Achucarro & Rattle: Nights in The Gardens of Spain [Blu-ray</a>]. It's amazing, though, how often EuroArts is able to capture lightning in a bottle -- providing what I consider a fully immersive experience of a definitive performance.

Now I have a third: ""Fellini, Jazz & Co.,"" with the Berlin Philharmonic, arguably the world's best orchestra, letting its hair down a bit under the baton of the great Riccardo Chailly. It's glorious fun, and this Blu-ray gives you a ticket to the party.

Shostakovich is not a favorite of mine, but the Suite No. 2 for Jazz Orchestra (derived from his film scores) is a revelation. It's immensely enjoyable from start to finish. Same is true of Rota's ""La Strada"" Ballet Suite.

That's followed by Respighi's ""Fountains of Rome"" and ""Pines of Rome"" (my main reasons for buying this disc). Admittedly, these popular works have been done to death, but I never tire of them, and I'd put this performance up against any other. It's the one I'll keep coming back to. The only drawback is that a baby's wailing reaches the orchestra's microphones in the hushed final moments of ""Fountains of Rome."" That comes with the territory -- this was recorded at a summer concert in Berlin's huge Waldbuhne amphitheatre, which seats more than 20,000.

The evening ends with several orchestral bon-bons by Shostakovich, Respighi and Lincke.

It's a totally satisfying experience -- brilliant performances of beautiful popular and lesser-known works, seamless camerawork and direction, and ideal sound. I did notice a couple of apparent digital ""hiccups"" in the otherwise pristine HD capture -- the last one occurs at 1:42:37 (it was evident on both of my Blu-ray players) -- but they go by in a flash and are hardly noteworthy.

At the end of the disc, I'm sure you'll be tempted to rise and applaud with the audience before it heads off, invigorated, into the Berlin night.",1370736000,,3576,6.4375
8501698,5,B006O8K480,"Even in the context of the long series of annual concerts from the Waldbuhne with the Berlin Philharmonic, this latest edition from 2011 must surely rank as one of the most joyous. This is in no small part due to the absolutely infectious enthusiasm of the conductor, Riccardo Chailly, who not only brings a totally professional comprehension to the scores and their delivery, he also adds that special extra ingredient - pure magic!

The title, 'Fellini, Jazz & Co', is correct in emphasising the film music element of this concert. This is a particularly true description of Nino Rota's film role as he collaborated as the composer of choice for the film director, Fellini. Chailly and the BPO give a fine performance of Rota's suite that he created from the music he previously wrote for Fellini's film, La Strada (1954). Shostakovich's Suite No. 2 for Jazz Orchestra, also known as the Suite for Variety orchestra, is also largely made up of extracts from various films for which he wrote the music. The two encores are taken from stage works by Shostakovich and Respighi.

The main works are the two most popular of Respighi's three Roman works - The Fountains of Rome and the Pines of Rome. These are given simply wonderful interpretations with the faster sections really sizzling and the slower sections sumptuous and moving. The recording of the nightingale in The Pines of the Janiculum movement is especially effective. This is followed by The Pines of the Appian Way which finish this Roman feast at just the right speed to suggest the approaching might of the Roman army and where Respighi stated that he wanted the ground to tremble under its footsteps. Too often, sad to say, this is played just a fraction too fast and the effect is lost and is replaced by a meaningless jolly jaunt. Not so here - tremendously effective, rousing and exciting. The crowd loved it and so did I!

That leaves the recording. The quality of the imaging seems to have gone up a notch here with the crispest definition I have ever seen at this event - or possibly anywhere else, at least in my collection. The sound is presented in stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio and fully matches the splendour of the occasion. There is no doubt in my mind that this is both a particularly outstanding event and recording and, as such, surely deserves the full 5 stars. It should give purchasers enormous pleasure and satisfaction for years to come.",1341964800,5,2425,4.769047619047619
