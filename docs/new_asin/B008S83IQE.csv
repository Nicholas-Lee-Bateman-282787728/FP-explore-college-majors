5180549,4,B008S83IQE,"If you like these films and do not already have them, this is a great way to get them.  Each is on its own disk, so the audio and video quality are quite good--no cruddy compression issues.  Of course, when you are dealing with films of this age, Blu-Ray really isn't much different than DVD, so there's little sense in buying these if you already have them on DVD.  The DVD version of this collection also will save you about 20% (at the time of this review), and that's worth considering if you are not concerned about having the very, very best quality.

At the time of this review, this collection sold for approximately $25.  That's a great value if you want all four films and a decent value if you want three of them.  If you only want one or two, you may want to do a little comparison shopping.  The extras, of which there are few (and really only for Flash Gordon and The Last Starfighter) are of nominal value.",1482451200,,921,4.319767441860465

5180559,5,B008S83IQE,"This is a bargain basement price for four very different science fiction classics that you should definitely own...

Dune (the 1984 feature film, not the 2000 miniseries) is an epic with a fairly large cast of notable (or soon to be notable) actors, including Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, Sting, and many others. The movie was panned by critics back in the day but has grown a cult following, and also inspired one of the most influential video games of all time.

Battlestar Galactica (1978) was the theatrical release of the 3-part pilot episode to the much revered (but short lived) television series of the same name. Fans of the series will know this by its episode name, ""Saga of a Star World.""

The Last Starfighter (1984) is a playful pop scifi flick that screams '80s, and broke ground in the early days of computer generated special effects in film.

And then there's Flash Gordon (1980), the campy cult classic with a soundtrack by Queen, a villainous Max von Sydow as Ming the Merciless, and appearances by Topol and Timothy Dalton.

The only unifying theme to this set is that Universal Pictures distributed them all. They clearly recycled the first disc of previous special edition releases, so don't expect a bunch of features or improvements on the picture quality from the DVDs that were previously made available for each of these titles.

All in all, a lot of fun with some very notable and very different science fiction films.",1473465600,,1450,4.803212851405623

5180565,4,B008S83IQE,These are 4 pretty darn good science fiction movies. I did not say great. But well worth the price because you get all 4. And they are kid friendly. Even Flash Gordon.,1466985600,,167,4.25
5180566,5,B008S83IQE,Four fantastic movies. I used to watch Battlestar Galactica when it was on and was so happy to find a movie about the show. All four are excellent movies. AAAA++++,1466380800,,163,4.466666666666667
5180567,2,B008S83IQE,"I remembered watching these as a kid so it seemed like a good deal.

Dune - was great, as ever!  Giant sand worms, mysterious powers, and Patrick Stewart trying to stab you in slow-motion.  What's not to love?  Plus that Baron Harkonnan is about the most evil and disgusting badguy of all time!

Battlestar Gallactica - is a staple, but, meh.  Okay, the effects are not great, but pretty status-quo for its day.  What really got be is how bad the acting was and obvious the plot.  Let me save you some time, every episode, ""the council is trying to stab its own people in the back, but we'll do something sneaky and get around it"".  Why not just overthrow the council?  Problem = solved.

The Last Starfighter - A kid is recruited as a space pilot based on his videogame playing skills.  I remember watching this as a kid and what kid wouldn't love that?  ""See, mom?  It's a SKILL!""  Back in the day I remember thinking it was cool, but going back and watching it as an adult... Man there's a lot of sex in this!  Like A LOT!  I'm kind of wondering how they got away with it back in then.

Flash Gordon - I had never actually seen this.  I thought I had, but I used to watch the really, really old black and white version, which was great in a ""spaceships where you can see the strings"" sort of way.  This one, however, was just annoying with a side-order of psychedelic.  I was to the point of, ""If they play that annoying 'Flash!' riff one more time, I'm seriously going to start rooting for Ming the Merciless.""

All in all, you're paying for Dune.  That's it.  The rest is just filler.",1465948800,,1589,4.29054054054054

Turns out The Last Starfighter held up pretty well, and having read Dune in close proximity to watching Lynch's adaptation, I can better see what he was going for, and I have a greater appreciation for it.

5180579,5,B008S83IQE,"Let me start by saying none of these films is great, but all of them are quite watchable.

For under $10 you get 4 decent space operas from the late 70s and early 80s all of which have at least some charm beyond that of nostalgia.

And if, like me, you grew up watching these, the nostalgic joy will be strong.  I think I saw all of them in the theaters then who knows how many times on TV or the VCR.

There's 1000s of reviews of each of these films but I'll throw down some quick thoughts.

Flash Gordon is the most fun of the 4, no one is taking it too seriously it really looks and feels like a 40s comic strip come to life.  And the Queen soundtrack is just icing on the cake.  Treat it like the old Batman show and you'll enjoy it.

Dune is visually stunning but very clumsily directed and written.  David Lynch was clearly out of his element trying to turn an ambitious and detailed sci-fi novel into the next Star Wars.  Watch it for the costumes and sets, ignore the words coming out of everyone's mouth.

Last Starfighter was a pleasant surprise.  Only the 2nd major movie to make extensive use of computer graphics (after Tron) it holds up well.  And the scenes on Earth at the hero's trailer park were surprisingly entertaining.

I still have to rewatch the Battlestar Galatica film/pilot so I'll edit something in later.",1462233600,,1333,4.34412955465587

Not the most spectacular transfers, mind you, but they're still worth the price. If you've never seen any of these, just get it.

You're getting The Last Starfighter, Dune, Flash Gordon, and Battlestar Galactica for an amazing price. Add in the fact that they are all recorded to individual DVDs - no worries about flipping disk sides to play a different movie, causing scratches and whatnot. If you like Science Fiction then this is a steal, otherwise it might not be up your alley. This is a collection which by today's standards would be affectionately referred to as B-movies, but at the time of production were renowned for their special effects. Regardless, the stories hold up very well and if you can look past the cheesy special effects, they are excellent films with great casts.",1430438400,3,825,4.816901408450704

5180651,5,B008S83IQE,"These are some of the greatest Sci Fi movies to come out of the 70's/80's!!! Not only is this a fantastic collection of movies, but these are the really nice ""Collectors Editions"" of the DVDs with all of the cool extras included and not just the bargain basement versions with nothing but the movie included. It would be a steal if there were only two of the movies included for the price, but all four...any fan of Sci Fi cinema owes it to themselves to get this collection.

First off, Flash Gordon. This movie is so strangely awesome it's hard to describe. It's a large scale production that's almost done as if it were a low budget Roger Corman special, and that in no way is a bad thing. It's very tongue in cheek and campy, but at the same time it's just plain FUN. This movie is so amazing that it played a major part in the recent comedy hit TED starring Mark Wahlberg and an animated teddy bear. A true 80's classic.

Secondly we have The Last Starfighter. I have so many great memories of this movie from my youth, and T.L.S. holds up relatively well (OK, maybe the FX are a little dated but still impressive for their day). I watched this movie EVERY SINGLE TIME I saw it on cable and I never got tired of it. At its' core it is one of the coolest family type movies I've ever seen because it's total wish fulfillment for any little boy who dreams of growing up to do great things, but seems to have the entire world stacked against him. This is also the very first movie to have completely computer generated visual effects. There would be no modern day big budget summer block busters without this courageous little film blazing the trail. It's a really cool little flick that takes the old King Arthur ""Sword in the Stone"" mythology and updates it into the video arcade age of 1984. At the very least, it will be fun to explain to your kids that video games used to be enclosed in gigantic wooden cabinets and you had to stand there and feed quarters into them constantly to play because there was no ""SAVE"" . It was all or nothing, baby!!!

Next we have Battlestar Galactica (Circa the 1970's ). This movie sized version of the classic Sci Fi television series is actually the first couple episodes stitched together. It introduces the main characters and the overall concept of the show that inspired the modern Emmy winning Battlestar series. IMO...this was one of the greatest science fiction TV series of all time. You had cool spaceships, creepy aliens, interesting characters, and the 70's Cylons are WAAAY cooler than the modern CG versions. Just look at their pimped out shiny armor and red scanner eye visors. totally bad ass.

Finally, we have David Lynch's epic version of Frank Herbert's epic Dune book series. This one might take a couple of viewings to sink in. It really is epic. If you haven't read the books, you may be a little confused by some of the trippier details of the story. Overall, it has a pretty basic good versus evil slant that everybody can get behind. Trust me though, you may need repeated viewings to pick up on all of the crazy goings on. Still a beautifully crafted and well acted film even if its' reach does exceed its' grasp a bit. Most people said that a Dune movie could never be made with the technology of the 80's, but they damn sure made a valiant effort. Watch this and then watch the mini series that was made in the 2000's . Together they will make perfect sense of Herbert's sprawling deep space tale of greed, power, mythology, and giant freakin' space worms.",1422748800,4,3526,4.47900466562986

5180670,5,B008S83IQE,"A great collection at a great price.  I'm giving 5 stars not because the four included movies are all great, but because this collection is a great value.  In case you are wondering, the case includes FOUR DVDs, one for each movie.  As a result, the movies also have the extras that come on the usual DVDs.

I have seen all of these films several times before, but I wanted a copy of Flash Gordon to share with my kids.  I considered buying the Blu-Ray for $15, which just had Flash Gordon, but this collection had three bonus movies for $10.  Flash Gordon is a great ""cult"" movie, so cheesy that it is good.  Did you know that the writer of Flash Gordon, Lorenzo Semple, Jr., was also the head writer of the 1966-1968 Batman TV show?  They have the same kind of cheesy humor.  What makes this film great is (a) the Queen soundtrack, (b) amazingly colorful sets, (c) great cheesy special effects paying homage to the original movie serials, and (d) great over-the-top performances by some well-known supporting actors, like Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed, Richard O'Brian (the writer of and played Riff-Raff in Rocky Horror Picture Show), and especially Max von Sidow as a spot-on-perfect Emperor Ming.

I have always enjoyed The Last Starfighter.  The plot is silly-fun (a teenager good at a space combat video game is grabbed to do the real thing in a real space ship), and it was the first significant use of CGI in a movie.  But what really makes it fun is the performance by Robert Preston (The Music Man, Victor/Victoria).

Dune was an attempt to turn an epic, complex novel into a movie with some mixed success.  Unless you have read the book, it is long, slow and somewhat confusing, but has some good visuals.  The sand worms are epic.  I read the book many years ago, so I enjoyed the film. Kyle McLaughlin (Twin Peaks, Showgirls) stars, and Patrick Stewart (Capt. Picard of Star Trek, Next Gen) and Sting (well known rock star) have supporting roles.  The main bad guy is especially creepy and gross.

Battlestar Galactica -- I haven't watched this yet, but I think it is the movie version of the 1970's TV show with Lorne Greene as Admiral Adama.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again.",1407801600,2,2198,4.604113110539846

Just as I remembered them and did not let me down. Flash Gordon and the Last Starfighter are also comedic in various areas of the movie.
