8046722,5,B0007CHR5W,"I saw ""Unfair Competition"" at a film festival, not knowing much about it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a touching portrait of neighbors who own competing businesses while they and their families are enmeshed in the same community.  With the coming of the fascists, collaborating with the Nazis, the non-Jewish shop owner aids his competitor and family maintain their dignity and their lives.  Part of why I like this film is that it portrays a chapter of the story of the Shoah (Holocaust) that is not familiar to many people--the life-saving actions of many Italians (both military and civilian) who refused to allow Hitler's policies dictate their actions.",1191196800,2,665,5.073394495412844
