Has helped me stay fit, relaxed, and agile so I can chase around the two year old I already have.  Love that it has two yoga videos on this dvd, one for beginners and one for advanced yogis.  Will continue to use this video postpartum to stay balanced and fit.  Makes a great babyshower gift, too (bought the video for my girl friends).",1324339200,,446,4.261904761904762
8448797,5,B004YT3AWI,"I have been shopping around for a while to find a suitable prenatal yoga DVD and I certainly found one.  Emma Sharma's DVD is wonderfully soothing for both body and soul.  I found the DVD practical and serene, it just flows..  Emma offers great commentary on each pose including alternative postures and advantages of each pose.  The DVD is beautifully shot and feels really current. There are two level workouts - beginners and advanced, depending on your personal fitness level and stage of your pregnancy. Whenever I practice Emma's yoga workout, I feel revitalised and relaxed.  I'm now in my 3rd trimester and already looking forward to Emma's 'Mother & Baby Yoga' DVD.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase!!",1312416000,,714,4.957983193277311
