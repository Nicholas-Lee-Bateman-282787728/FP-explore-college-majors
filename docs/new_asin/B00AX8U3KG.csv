5525761,5,B00AX8U3KG,"This film was just plain fun.  Part murder mystery, part romance.  Great acting by the two leads and a terrific supporting cast, though some silly peripheral sequences which I'm finding typical of many of these series.  Good subtitles, fast shipping by supplier, packaged well.",1397779200,,277,5.25
5525762,5,B00AX8U3KG,"One of the best of K-Drama: it includes romance, humor, action, mystery, revenge, time-slip and so much more.  The series has two of the most charming leads in a funny and tender love story, with a terrific supporting cast; great writing, direction and musical score, And unlike too many series with rushed endings, this one has a concluding episode that pulls everything together and satisfies the soul. I love K-Drama, and this one is 2nd only to Faith: The Great Doctor on my own ever growing list of favorites.",1396224000,,514,4.775280898876405
5525763,5,B00AX8U3KG,"ROOFTOP PRINCE should be considered as one of a trio of Korean time travel movies with Dr. Jin and THE GREAT DOCTOR as the other two. All three are entertaining accounts of time travel between modern day Korea and the Korea of the Joseon age. ROOFTOP PRINCE begins as a tragedy with the murder of the Crown Princess of 300 years ago. The Crown Prince swears revenge on the unknown perpetrators and chooses three retainers to help him solve the crime. All three are subject to assassination and while escaping by leaping on horseback over a cliff, somehow are propelled into the future by landing on the rooftop of a building whose apartment is occupied by the reincarnation of his previous life's sister-in-law. The prince also meets the reincarnation of his princess who has no memory of their past life together. Though ROOFTOP PRINCE begins in tragedy, it soon enough morphs in a comic fish out of water tale. The prince and his trio of time traveling companions ooh and ahh their way through what to them is a magical mystery tour of computers, cell phones, traffic jams, and pizza. Along the way the plot alternates between the hilarity of adjusting to a colossal change in their lives to the serious business of overcoming the machinations of corporate baddies all the while trying to solve a three centuries old crime. Love is in the air as the prince finds himself falling for his former sister-in-law even as he discovers that his reincarnated wife is just the same bitchy backstabber that she always was but he did not know that until late in the film. The director wisely avoids the inevitable paradoxes of monkeying with the past to alter the present though the ending seems to suggest that True Love must triumph despite formidable odds. The trio who portray the retainers are distinctive in their own right and they have no problem learning the complexities of laptops and cell phones. The crown prince must learn that in the 21th century he simply cannot make things happen by issuing orders. The crown princess is a caricature of opportunism. The updated ex-sister-in-law is sweet but tough-minded. We in the audience do not care about the cavernous logical flubs because we have learned to care about their respective fates. Even the villains are more than one-dimensional cutouts. Thus, when we come to the end of the 20 episode series, we ponder the reality of unreality even after the credits have finished their run. A truly amazing film.",1395446400,,2459,4.815602836879433
5525764,4,B00AX8U3KG,"Since I saw a korean drama a few years ago I been adicted to it, these drama is very funny and very heart felt., subtitles are good too.",1395446400,,136,3.892857142857143
5525765,5,B00AX8U3KG,"I thought the series was top rate.  It had comedy, drama, suspense, love.  The acting for great.  I looked series twice and will probably look at it again.  Micky Yoochan is a very good actor.",1394323200,,192,4.4

5525767,5,B00AX8U3KG,"Young prince Lee Gak is from the Joseon era and looking for a wife. Hwa Yong and Boo Young are sisters and were both considered to be the princess. Boo Young is chosen, but the night before their wedding Hwa Yong leaves an ugly burn mark on her sister's face, scarring her for life. No longer able to marry the prince, her sister eagerly takes her place.

Years later, Boo Young helps her sister sew and do other tasks that the prince thinks his wife is doing. Although the prince adores his wife, he can hold an intelligent conversation better with Boo Young. But since his sister-in-law covers the burn mark with a handkerchief, he has only ever seen her eyes. Boo Young quietly loves the prince from the sidelines while her sister keeps up her fake endearing image in front of the prince. But one night the crown princess is murdered and Lee Gak is devastated and devises a team of three men with different unique talents to help catch her killer. But during the hunt, he and his men mysteriously time-travel to present day Korea.

In modern day Korea, the men are thrust into a strange, overwhelming, and confusing new world. The rooftop home they land on belongs to a spunky, straight-forward woman, Park Ha, that they later find out is the prince's sister-in-law's reincarnation. To his surprise, he also finds a woman that looks exactly like his wife. In order to return to the past though and catch her killer, he assumes he must marry her reincarnation. While doing what he can to marry her, he finds out that his reincarnation was murdered. Or was he? As he tries to solve the reasons to why he time-traveled, he and Park Ha are falling in love. Will the prince and his sister-in-law's reincarnation be able to find love in this lifetime? Or will tragedy strike again and tear them apart?

This is such a great and entertaining romantic comedy. It's even better than I was expecting. It has lots of laugh-out-loud comedy, especially when the prince and his men are exploring modern day Korea. It's also heartfelt, romantic, and even has some action. This drama has so many likable characters and a fantastic story with lots of twists and turns. There is so much going on in the story that I couldn't fit it all in this review. It also has great music. I have the music on my iPod. This drama has a star-studded cast which includes; Micky Yoochun, Han Ji Min, Lee Tae Sung, Jung Yoo Mi, Kim So Hyun, and few more.

8558814,5,B00AX8U3KG,"I so love this Korean TV series. It's the best. The plot is excellent, the characters excellent, the music excellent. This particular copy was supposed to have English subtitles and it showed on the disc that it did. However, I could never get them to come up. Unfortunately, I do not speak or understand Korean, so I sent it to my son who speaks Chinese and knows Korean in the hopes that he could use it. I don't really know if there was anything wrong with the DVD or if the problem had to do with me and the fact I don't know how to use my DVD player like I should. If you have a chance to see this on your computer or Netflix or whatever, though, I'm pretty sure you'll love the story. It has time travel - so it's mystical, a love story, a mystery and more. I recommend it.",1494806400,,779,4.098039215686274

8558817,1,B00AX8U3KG,It sucked. Anticlimactic. Waste of time. The characters seemed to get dumber and more gullible as the show got farther in the season. If you like this drama you have no taste.,1463961600,,175,4.5

Did not like much the male actors but the story hooks you up and there are plenty of great scenes, particularly towards the end of the series. The final episodes are the best indeed and when you reach them, you are already loving the characters, in spite of the actors :)

Good English subtitle.",1433462400,,393,4.3108108108108105
