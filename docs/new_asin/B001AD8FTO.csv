8277056,4,B001AD8FTO,"This old British movie is very well done and tells an often-overlooked part of World War II history!  As usual, the British acting is top-rate, but this film suffers from British editing and cinematography woes, compared to Hollywood's technical superiority.
Some actual footage of the V-1 or V-2 rocket is included, which adds to its veracity.
This film is a tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of the Polish people and their contributions to defeating the Nazi war machine.
I recommend this film to everyone interested in WWII genre films and the history of that period.",1367884800,,573,4.96875

It's a pretty good guerrilla activity movie, similar in quality to some of the French resistance movies made around the same era. Michael Rennie is a Polish underground member along with a bunch of his pals and eventually the lead actress playing his wife is involved too.

  He is sent by the underground leadership to voluntarily go to a labor camp at Peenemunde along the German Baltic coast. The underground believes there is something of interest there they would like him to smuggle information out about. Turns out they are right, he and his accomplices at the camp notice V-1 rockets in some hangars. I won't give any spoilers, but they have some mock up V-1's in this movie which look real and the underground ends up capturing one.

  There's not a lot of equipment used in the movie, there is a transport plane eventually that lands but other than that it is not an expensive looking movie. No big pitched battles or anything. It has a good story, no Hollywood romance side stories really, a couple of decent shoot out scenes with the Germans and a pretty good ending. Black and white by the way. Christopher Lee plays a small role as a German camp guard. Pretty good acting all around too. I'd have liked it more if the Poles spoke Polish and the Germans spoke German. I'm kind of a realist with movies concerning that, it makes them so much more real.

  I'd add another half star if the languages were authentic but it's still worth watching. I can't wait to get the DVD version eventually.",1269561600,,1609,4.520689655172414
