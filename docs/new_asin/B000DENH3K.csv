One suggestion though, pay close attention to the sportsmanship exhibited by both teams from beginning to end. It is hard to believe just how far the game has devolved along those lines.
This is the complete game including pregame and some postgame but no halftime. The game is commercial free. Rating quality is an iffy thing these days. We have become spoiled to all the visual perfections now available that it is easy to forget things weren't always as they are now. There are no hi-def miracles here, people. This is, however, an excellent quality video of a telecast from JANUARY 1, 1979. Just keep that in mind as you watch the game. For comparison sakes, it is as good as, if not better, than those abbreviated games shown on ESPN CLASSIC.",1485302400,,884,4.60126582278481
