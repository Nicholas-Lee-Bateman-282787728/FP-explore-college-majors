8636540,5,B00HVP4XPK,"This disk highlights a British choreographer named Wayne McGregor whose use of random movements may not have much of a future, but currently offers a radical and highly effective reimagining of professional dance. The disk contains two films about him by Catherine Maximoff. The first, a documentary called ""Going Somewhere"" shows him working with academics, computer programmers, high school students, and dancers from the Royal Ballet. He asks his performers to invent random movements in space for an abstract situation, such as imagining an invisible wall or box, moving in that space without a script or use of repetition.

Since, the minute you plan a movement it stops being random, and McGregor interrupts constantly with ""suggestions"" for how each person might think and move, this is both off-putting and slightly ridiculous. However, his students do get somewhere unique to them and it is fascinating to watch as they feel out an approach and put it into motion on stage. The documentary includes the high school group, comprising students with many different, decidedly non-balletic, shapes, performing a piece for a large group of their peers. The audience seemed genuinely impressed with the emotional power of it all.

The second film on the disk was a performance utilizing dancers from the Royal Ballet called ""Moment in Time."" There have been many questions about the future of ballet because so many of the movements and so much of the training is rigid and ritualized to the point that the same ballets get endlessly recycled and innovative ideas fail to attract a large audience. Nacho Duato caused a sensation for a while with his attempts to create new kinds of movements, but almost as soon as he choreographed on his own his work began to grow stale and repetitive, at least for me.

McGregor's use of unscripted physical conversations about unspecified needs are always going to be new, because they heavily rely on unique aspects of each dancer and group situation. The same, however, makes his works impossible to duplicate beyond the same group of dancers. It may well have a future in creating new works that will thrill audiences as much as they did me. However, I wonder what happens when the training that made these dancers so flexible and strong becomes irrelevant? Will people continue to pay for a season of performances based on his enforced ""randomness,"" or will it simply move to the streets and community groups as an extension of raves or other street dance experiences?",1508716800,,2512,5.033653846153846
