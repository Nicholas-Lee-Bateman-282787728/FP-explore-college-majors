8098697,4,B000CEXGDW,this movie is pretty good for a remake. i liked how that it was john carpenter and debra hill made their own remake of a classic. the story is pretty much the same a little different i liked the fact that they gave blake more of a origin and how he and his clan got killied in the original they tell you in this one they show you and you know a little bit more about him. and i liked the fact that they gave elizabeth a bigger role. the acting is good the story is good and the special effects are good. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1481414400,,559,3.869565217391304
8098698,1,B000CEXGDW,"This movie made as much sense as a turd in a frying pan and stunk just as bad! Do yourself a favor, buy the 1980 original and save your money.

The cast and story were so unimpressive I was hard pressed not to just throw the dvd out in the fog.",1138838400,6,244,3.784313725490196
