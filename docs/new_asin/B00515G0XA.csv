4519586,4,B00515G0XA,I saw the one on TV and there were a lot of minimal but necessary to understand some of the scenes on this DVD if you did not watch the version on TV.  It is a very good story,1385596800,,175,3.4871794871794872
4519587,4,B00515G0XA,"Para Volver a amar (To Love Again - 726 minutes)

This has many laugh-out-loud moments because we watch people be polite to one another, but then we get to see what is really on their mind: e.g., (Handsome Man to Rescued Woman) ""Do you want my handkerchief?"" Woman, ""Yes, and your hair, and your eyes and your lips!"" Whereupon she leaps up onto him, straddling and kissing him. Actually, she smiles and says, ""Si, Gracias.""

Another example: polite clerk serving coffee to nasty executive in a meeting, ""Senor, would you like more coffee?"" (insultingly) ""Yes.""  Whereupon she pours hot coffee all down his white shirt, suit and into his lap! Actually, she carefully fills the cup and moves on.

Abused wife is bullied by husband. So she proceeds to pummel him about the head and shoulders!  Actually, she is acquiescent and calming.

This is very much a feminist piece, with an all-female real estate office, abused women in shelters, wives and mothers of drunks, plus philanderers and bullies. There are nice men, too, but they are in the vast minority.

We have rapes, breast cancer, leukemia, a closeted gay man, real estate chicanery (squatters on prime land) and illegals who hire coyotes so they can get to the U.S. You see an excellent roster of terrific actors and this is extremely well directed.

4519588,5,B00515G0XA,"I am watching this story once a week playing and suppose to be one hour show  but with commercials you really enjoy it 30 minutes.
That's why I got the entire 12 hours show. I enjoy it, I like it.",1365033600,,196,3.9
4519589,5,B00515G0XA,"Televisa, the biggest TV network in Mexico, had (yes, in past tense) a history of making some great international hits but somewhere in the last 15 years, they have cut back on writing & artistic preparation, choosing to focus on rehashing old stories and focusing on pretty people. Luckily, also in the last 15 years, there has been an emergence of other Mexican television to offer competition.

""Para volver a amar"" is no exception. It is a remake of a Colombian telenovela but Televisa succeeded in this as the production value of it is fantastic and features one of the best ensemble cast of talent. The star of it is Rebecca Jones, whom was already an international icon due to her participation in the classic ""Cuna De Lobos (1986)"" and was also the first Telenovela she has done for Televisa in over a decade.

The story involves four different couples of different ages & backgrounds yet all encounter the same problem: Dealing with being a woman, wife & mother successfully. It utilizes lots of imagination sequences to evoke frustration but it works effectively.

The DVD is condensed from the original airing and does a good job of keeping the key plots of the story to keep you interested.",1327968000,,1202,4.769230769230769
4519590,5,B00515G0XA,"I started watching novelas with my aunt in 1995; so far, this is the BEST telenovela I've ever watched.  The acting is great and the story line is so real.  I've also watched segments of the South American version (El Ultimo Matrimonio Feliz) and this re-make is just so much better.  I waited patiently until it came out in DVD form to buy it.  Great viewing!",1323043200,,360,4.409090909090909

4519593,2,B00515G0XA,I don't like this DVD because they just presented a summary about the whole story there a lot things you don't see. I can say that because I saw almost the half by TV and I just want to finish soon the time they show it is too late for me it is at 12:00 am. It is not a good choice when you don't see the story on TV.I don't say the same for the shipping it was excellent I got the item before the time I was expecting it.,1313280000,10,422,3.6483516483516483
