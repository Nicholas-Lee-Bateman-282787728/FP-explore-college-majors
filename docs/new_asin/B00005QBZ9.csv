1647531,5,B00005QBZ9,"8 Man After really doesn't seem like the type of anime that one would be interested in. Let's face it, the story is fairly typical. Man becomes cyborg, cyborg becomes crimefighter. Wow, that's original. Even more to the point is the fact that the story is the exact same story as Robocop. However, what most don't realize is that Robocop actually rips this off. Granted the 8 Man movie and this were made after, but the original manga was made long before. So, it's not fair to call the story cliched.
The story starts out with a private detective names Hazama trying to get information on a man named Eddy Schmidt. Eddy stole valuable medical secrets from a company, and has begun to revolutionize the crime industry by using robotics to replace limbs and create a generation of powerful cyborg criminals. Hazama is nearly killed by a powerful cyborg named Tony Gleck, a person Hazama had previously ""killed"". On the verge of death the police give the authorization to put Hazama into a special suit, thus turning him into the 8 Man.
What makes the movie so good is how well-done it is, even though it is very low-budget. It revolutionized the anime world with very popular camera techniques such as the single dot to represent someone moving really quickly, or the camera angle where a person catches some bullets then slowly drops them. The story always stays well paced, and never seems to fizzle out. And, if you've seen him, you will agree that 8 Man can make one hell of an entrance. Despite being quite gory, it managed to resist the urge to have the typical anime nudity (although it came quite close). Overall, it remains my favorite anime and one of the best out there, if not the best.",1054339200,8,1697,4.622516556291391

7950202,5,B00005QBZ9,"I watched this as a kid on Sci-Fi channel Saturday Anime when I was in high school.  It is hands down one of my favorite anime's of all time.  It a realistic adult story with flawless execution.  The story telling is great, I love the tall and skinny drawling style as well as the action.

Anyone who likes a action/cop story would like this movie.  Even if they don't like anime.

Buy it",1393891200,,388,4.2465753424657535
7950203,5,B00005QBZ9,it's like the old days. the special effects then was good. the story was good. it's an old cartoon but it's a good one.,1329609600,,119,4.0
7950204,5,B00005QBZ9,"I have been a fan of 8th Man (as he was known in the United States) since the 1960's, when he had his very own tv series and was called Tobor. ""8 Man After"" keeps the original Japanese name for all the characters, including the eponymous cyborg hero (""Eito Man""). The action in this movie takes place some years after the death of the first cyborg to use the name 8 man, and the new robot is more complex, more troubled, and more human. Ultimately this 8 man is the most heroic of all his incarnations, and also the most exciting. The story is compelling and the images are beautifully drawn. Despite the usual grittiness and violence which we all have come to associate with anime, ""8 man After"" has an appealing ending which frankly I wish the writers had expanded upon. The 8 man character has SO MUCH potential, far beyond that of being the inspiration for Robo Cop. In spite of 8 man's cartoonish name, he is a complex creation rich with narrative possibilities. He is a unique and very likeable superhero. It's a shame more hasn't been done with him. This DVD is a small treasure. I recommend it eagerly to everyone.",1216598400,,1122,4.478048780487805

but Truely Top manga for it's time
Classic ""Robocop meets the Terminator"" style animation

saw it over 10 years ago on the big screen and it was fantastic & edgy even then
Now to have my own copy it's even better~!",1209600000,,260,4.078431372549019
7950206,5,B00005QBZ9,"Well this was a blind pick for me before I ordered it.  Hadn't seen on it on the sci-fi ch/ like some of you, just read the synopsis and the story sounded really cool, like an anime version of Robocop or something.

Well its way better than Robocop, though I thoroughly enjoyed that movie as a kid.  I was very impressed w/ the look of the piece, most directors don't use the purple haze back/foreground, that was cool.  If you like cop-animes you will love this!  If you want monsters/vampires you will hate it.  It's actually very realistic?  The story is just as engaging as the action, and theres lots of action.

Bottom line it was 100+mins and it felt like 30?  I wanted it to be longer, or have another separate feature.  Hope they make a sequel.  The price is well worth it, very good deal.",1142294400,6,891,4.432098765432099

7950208,5,B00005QBZ9,"I found this movie to be one of the many animes about cyborgs, this one has a twist, the cyborg is having trouble controlling his aggression when taking on the bad guys. The thought that he is becoming as violent as the enemy he must stop causing him to doubt his affectiveness as a hero.",1125964800,,288,4.254545454545455

There is no way i can explain how cool this movie is without ruining  it for u. All i can is watch it, 8man After gives u the bang for your buck. Yeah i know that was cheesy but still...watch this movie.",1079049600,3,352,3.9577464788732395
