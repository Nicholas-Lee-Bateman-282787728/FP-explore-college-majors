Take the Money and Run, one of my top 2 Woody Allen films, nice to finally have on Blu-ray! Hoping for a Blu-ray release of ""Play it Again Sam"" one day

The video transfer while not perfect, is still very good. Grain and thus Detail appear left intact leaving a theatrical look.  Given the low budget of the film and way it was made may make this the best the film will ever look on a home video release...

3573,5,0764003828,"This was one of Woody Allen's first film ventures and his first film for general release.  It was 100% pure fun and by far his most 'accessible' film for all audiences.  You will note that it had aspects of Saturday Night live and much of the comedy that we're used to.  Note that this was long before SNL and spinoffs like Animal House or Trading Places.  Woody invented some of this humor.
The plot is straightfoward: Woody Allen plays a chronically challenged underachiever(as always) with a long-suffering girlfriend/spouse.  He finally holds up a bank and does it in the way only Woody could.  The sight gags, blackout sketches, and double-entendre(inside jokes) are relentless and great.  Whatever you see that's inventive and reminds you of something else, remember that it was invented here, probably.
I recommend this film as a must-have for Woody Allen devotees and anyone who wants a good silly comedy.  I've never met anyone who didn't like this...",1420761600,,960,4.95625

 I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie, thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout, not breathing any life into the role.

3612,4,0764003828,"this is not the first movie in which woody allen starred.  however, it was the first movie which would form the pattern for the rest of his movie making life. ergo, he scripted it, directed it and starred in it.  if you followed his earlier standup act, this first movie captures the shtick he established with that act.  he is a character who can do nothing right yet he wants to be a criminal mastermind, especially with robbing banks.  he has some great comic moments in this film. in one he attempts to play a cello in a marching band.  in another he tries to escape prison using a gun he carved out of soap but it rains. these are great comic set ups and sketches.

the romance he sets up involves the female archtype we see in every woody allen movie. she is young, good looking, bright and, most importantly, not Jewish. his pursuit of the ultimate shiksa will continue in virtually every subsequent film. he gets better at this when he starts using Diane Keaton, followed by Mia Farrow.

many people would have liked woody allen to continue making comic movies like this one for the rest of his life. instead of continuing with this broad farce style, he would develop his own blend of combining comedy with tragedy instead.

i liked this film and laughed a lot but i'm glad he did not spend over forty years making variations of it. one of allen's biggest inspirations, the Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, did slight variations of the same comedic shtick over their entire professional lives.  allen took much bigger artistic risks by not sticking to these broad comedic setup gags.

Woody Allen understands that to create humor you have to have an element of seriousness. The narration of Jackson Beck provides the element of seriousness. Beck makes it seem like a serious documentary but what is happening on the screen is wholly other. Therein lies the humor for this movie. My favorite scenes are the misspelled note for the bank robbery, the car in the house in an attempt to kill Miss Blair, and the entire chain gang sequence.

experimental in it's own crazy, low budget way.

One of the reasons that I'm not a fan of Woody Allen (besides that the sicko impregnated his adopted daughter) is that I don't appreciate the whole nebbishy, neurotic, lack of physicality,  Jewish stereotype. I'm Jewish (albeit a ""big"" Jew)  and that persona does nobody any good.

However, in 1969, when this movie was made, that negative caricature, was not really utilized in the movies. Taking that stereotype and coupling it with that of a ruthless and bold criminal was unique. The notion that the viewer saw the caricature as always failing, yet the charactor himself did not perceive himself that way, was a refreshing way of telling a story. The story and narrative was so odd that I find the movie [still] refreshingly funny.

From the day he was born, he devoted his life to crime from the beginning when he knocked off bubblegum machines to his later years when he attempted several bank robberies. Unfortunately, although Virgil was inventive, he was hardly smooth and all of his attempts ended in failure with his glasses smashed on the sidewalk. One good thing happened to him, though; he met a pretty girl (Janet Margolin) and fell in love.

This hilarious film has lost none of its punch over the years. There are so many memorable scenes and great running gags. The humor is still fresh and interesting, but the style blends well with modern comedy. Although Allen has moved away from this style in his more modern films, his early work appeals to younger audiences.

The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.

3687,5,0764003828,"Take The Money And Run is the first movie Woody Allen ever wrote, directed and starred in all at once. Even early on in his film career, Woody Allen shows genius and promise to grow much, much further than most artists ever go. The film's plot moves along at a good pace and the acting increases the quality of the movie--and the jokes.

The film, as you may well know, is a spoof of documentaries called a ""mockumentary."" The film purports to show the life and times of a petty criminal named Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen). We see him being bullied by his childhood peers on the streets and his failure at playing the cello signals his failure to become a successful criminal.

The film is essentially one gag after another in rapid fire. We see Virgil fail at bank robbery after bank robbery; perhaps the funniest is when Virgil and his buddies try to rob a bank when another gang wants to rob the same bank on the same day. We also see Virgil fall in love with beautiful Louise (Janet Margolin). Janet plays Louise with a great deal of realism and her matter-of fact attitude toward Virgil's bank robbing is comical as well.

In order to make Take The Money And Run feel even more like a documentary, we get ""interviews"" with Virgil's parents (who wear Groucho Marx glasses to disguise themselves) and teachers and acquaintances who knew Virgil. The acting is excellent.

The DVD doesn't offer too many extras but the movie is so well done that I will give this a five star rating anyway.

Take The Money And Run is sure to give you a laugh--in fact, you'll be laughing all the way. The ""mockumentary"" style of the film enhances its comedic effect. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy comedy films and fans of Woody Allen.",1196726400,,1740,4.528662420382165
3688,5,0764003828,"When the history of 20th century comedy is written, someone will tell the story of the geniuses who emerged from the working class neighborhoods of New York's outer boroughs: Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. Neil Simon will make the list, along with Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen. There are others, of course. Together they make up one of the most remarkable flowerings of comic talent in American history. Woody's talent sprang from him fully formed. His basic gift is in full evidence in this early picture. It is debatable that he has improved with age, although it is worth noting that his exposure, like Harold Pinter's, to elegant, bourgeois life permanently altered the objects of his comic study. Mia Farrow introduced him to the good life, to aristocratic penthouse life, and there was no turning back. Still, his genius can be seen in his ability to adjust and move on. Later Woody is every bit as good as his early work, but not necessarily better, unless you happen to like posh talk and that very special boredom of the urban bourgeoisie. This early picture, though lacking in elegant settings and posh-talk, is vintage; here we having that wonderful skewering of pieties that one remembers from the Marx Brothers. Woody is wonderful at exposing pretensions, great and small. Here he plays a small-time hoodlum, a kind of Sylvester Stallone, played as a clumsy oaf, a loser, and nebbishy klutz, with eyes for the gals. Groucho, where are you? The film is a work of genius.

3690,5,0764003828,"Watching this movie almost 40 years after it came out cannot capture how irreverent it felt in 1969.  The world has become so much cruder and the language so much more coarse that this feels much like a family film today.  It is funny, yes, but some of it feels dated.  Comedy is often tied to its time and doesn't travel to a later time so well.  Yet, much of the movie remains terrific and classic.  There are many lines that have become part of the language (""it is if you're doing it right"", for example).  Just go up to anyone who knows the film and say ""abt natural"" or ""I have a gub"" and they will likely begin to chuckle.  And, of course, there is the soap and shoe polish gun in the rain.

It is also nice to see Janet Margolin in one of her best roles as the female lead, Louise, Virgil's eternally loyal girlfriend.  She was taken far too young by ovarian cancer, but this role is a great one to remember her by.

For those who haven't seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That's Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.  That mix of self-awareness and yet being completely unaware is the source of much of the humor.  It really does work and is quite funny.

3699,3,0764003828,"Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.

Lacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.

Of less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package.",1158537600,,2268,5.1603260869565215
3700,3,0764003828,"This early Woody Allen comedy is often quite a bit of fun.  Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as ""Take the Money and Run"" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.

Unfortunately, the full-frame version of ""Take the Money and Run"" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.

As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.  Margolin basically plays straight woman to Allen but it's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in ""David and Lisa"" didn't have a more substantial film career.",1138492800,3,1268,4.718181818181818
3703,5,0764003828,"Woody Allen is a great filmmaker who has made some comedies that are also deep character studies (Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, etc.). However, there's something to be said for films like What's Up, Tiger Lily, Play it Again, Sam and Sleeper -- films that are just plain funny. Probably the best of these is Take the Money and Run which spoofs the true crime documentaries of the time. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a hilariously inept career criminal whose life is one misadventure after another. Using ""testimony"" from people in Starkwell's life and cinema vierte style photography, Allen peppers the audience with hilarious sight gag after sight gag. Among my favorites:

1. In high school, Starkwell joins the marching band ... as a cello player. The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.

2. Starkwell invites his girlfriend (played by Janet Margolin of ""David and Lisa"") to dinner but doesn't have the money. He breaks into several parking meters. When he tips the maitre'd, he dumps several dollars in change into his hand and all over the floor.

3. Starkwell robs a bank, but the teller can't read the note he hands him, thinking that the word ""gun"" is ""gub.""

4. When entering prison, one of the guards frisks Starkwell, inducing peals of ticklish laughter.

Indeed, Take the Money and Run seems a lot more like a film by Allen's former colleague on Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks, than like one of his later films. The story is just a framework for gag after gag -- most of which are unbelievably funny. Allen did some wonderful and deep character studies later in his career, but Take the Money and Run is a hilarious comedy that should stand among his best work.",1135036800,,1830,4.688473520249222
3704,5,0764003828,"`Take the Money and Run' is the very first movie where Woody Allen is writer, director, and star, and true to the first film in any artist's series of work, it may be the his best up to `Annie Hall', his seventh film as writer/director/star and arguably his very best comedy. `Love and Death' and `Bananas' may a little weak. `Play It Again, Sam' has the first writing and direction where the audience develops some empathy with the characters, so it presages the more serious business of the later films. But `Take the Money and Run' is simply nonstop silliness, with some of the longest and best running gags this side of Mel Brooks.

Even this very first movie has many of Allen's trademarks. For a relatively low budget movie, the quality of the music is very, very good, with original pieces contributed by the up and coming Marvin Hamlisch. Even though the supporting cast is not filled with a lot of highly recognizable actors, most of the faces such as the chain gang supervisor all seem to have a vaguely familiar look about them. Allen's female lead is Janet Margolin, for whom this is probably the highlight of her career. His `Bananas' costar, Louise Lasser, later of `Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' appears in a very small role.

Two other trademark motifs are the flashbacks to boyhood and the cut-aways to interviews with the principle character's parents. These devices appear in `Annie Hall' and even in the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors' plus several other films.

Another typical aspect of this movie is that it is a parody of documentaries, although not with such loving artfulness as Allen does in `Zelig'.

One thing that is entirely absent is any intellectuality. I can't recall any joke for which you need to read a Russian novel or see a classic silent movie to understand. While it strikes me that poor Virgil Starkwell does have some mock heroic aspects which may have been borrowed from `Don Quixote' or `Candide', I think that may be my seeing things of which Allen had no inkling.

Allen has claimed, contrary to a lot of other artists' statements, that comedy is easy. Allen is so adept in this movie at spinning off high quality jokes at such a rate that he genuinely makes it seem effortless. And yet, like the proverbial Chinese meal, you leave this movie and an hour later, you are `still hungry'. That is, you take away no warm feelings for any characters and their situations or any satisfaction that a hero succeeded in a quest or a heavy got their just deserts.

Some movies have compared Allen's work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can't hold a candle to Fields' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.

My primary recommendation for people who may like some but not all of Allen's films, this one should definitely be in your collection, whether you just like his `early, funny' movies or prefer all his styles, but want to skip over some of the darker, less well written, or less interesting works.",1115078400,4,3382,4.722033898305085

Also of note is when he poses as a classical musician but can't place the name of Mozart.  This is happy, loose camp in the spirit of the Marx Brothers.

The story concerns one Virgil Starkwell, a bespectacled failure who resorts to crime for a living, and can't even be a success at that. He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says ""I have a gub"" or ""I have a gun"".

3711,3,0764003828,"From around this early time, before Allen truly crystallized his peculiar brand of a nebbish neurotic New York man, I had enjoyed Bananas and Sleeper for their sheer creativity and comic pizzazz. I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not.
A prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.
For Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo. It simply hasn't stood the test of time.",1089590400,4,1109,4.873015873015873

Woody Allens character needs money desperately, and so, in a short thought attempt, he jimmies open a gumball machine and gets away with pockets and pockets of quarters.
I have not much to say about this film other than I wouldn't recommend buying it, but you at least have to see it,",1055203200,,560,4.054054054054054

Just a very funny movie, and one of the few worth having in your collection.
While this DVD is currently out of print, it's probably worth the the extra money as it's hard not to watch over and over.  I've never seen it on TV or cable, and aside from my DVD, the only other time I've seen it was when it originally came out in the movies.",1050710400,,615,4.177966101694915

The film is set as a documentary on the life of the worst criminal of all-time, Virgil Starkwell, who never pulled off a successful crime in his life.  The film is a fast-paced and sharply written.  It sets up the Woody Allen persona, the likable loser, that he would portray in most of his subsequent films.

3718,5,0764003828,"Though I usually enjoy Woody Allen's more recent work, I'm one of many filmgoers whose heart still belongs to his earlier, anything-for-a-laugh, anarchistic comedies like Bananans, Sleeper, and this one.  Take the Money And Run was Woody Allen's first real film to direct himself and it remains one of his funniest.  Disguised as a documentary, this 1969 film tells the hilarious story of Virgil Starkweather, the world's most inept (if stupidly optomistic) thief.  Like most of Woody Allen's early films, everything is played almost solely for the laughs it might provide and nearly forty years later, it all holds up very well.  Lots of hilarious stuff in here (at times, this film is the funniest Mel Brooks film that Mel Brooks never made) but my personal favorite bits would have to include: Virgil's parents who disguise their indentities by wearing Groucho Marx glasses but will be familiar to anyone whose seen any of Allen's films, Virgil's attempt to rob a bank is foiled when none of the clerks can read his bad handwriting, another robbery goes wrong when a rival gang decides to rob the same bank at the same time, Virgil's attempt to escape from prison by making a fake gun out of soap is ruined when it starts to rain, the sight of Woody Allen on a southern chain gang (and being punished by being locked in the hole with an insurance salesman), and especially the scene where a man Virgil attempts to mug turns out to be not only a childhood school friend but an undercover cop as well.  Directing with a wild-anything-goes-spirit, Woody Allen gives one of his first (and best) ""born loser"" performances as Virgil.  Amongst all the madness, the film also presents a bizarrely sweet love story between Virgil and his wife, who is well-played by the lovely (and the sadly no longer with us) Janet Margolin.  Always underappreciated, Margolin was one of those forgotten, at times almost painfully vulnerable actresses that one can't help but fall in love with everytime she appears on screen. Though overshadowed by the later Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Janet Margolin was Woody Allen's first unlikely love interest (in both film and briefly real life) and they have a strong chemistry together that adds much heart to a wild film.  Take the Money and Run remains hilarious and will be enjoyed by both fans of Woody Allen and classic film comedy.",1012262400,47,2360,4.838709677419355
3719,4,0764003828,"This Woody Allen movie, not often viewed, is an old gem, just like Bananas and Sleeper. The humor is a little bit childish at times, but it's still Woody Allen humor.
The plot, well, forget the plot anyway. If you are a truly Woody Allen's fan, you will not question his ability to entertain any time.",1006646400,,301,4.392857142857143
3720,3,0764003828,"""Take the Money and Run"" will not entertain or humour those of us familiar with the rest of Woody Allen's sparkling oeuvre. Its only real value is as a curiosity.
This is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.
The mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"". Not till ""Love and Death"" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.
While most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying ""Get to the point"" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.
This film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on ""Take the Money and Run"", you won't be missing too much.",997660800,4,2022,4.650837988826815
3721,3,0764003828,"'Take the Money and Run' is the first film directed, written by, and starring Woody Allen.  While nowhere near the debute of Orson Welles, Allen shows considerable comic promise as he attempts to translate his wierd and wild though shyly neurotic stage act onto the silver screen.
First of all, this movie is hilarious.  No doubt about it, Allen's mockumentary about a looser con is top-notch comedy.  Allen's use of gags are endless (re. glasses, rabbis, soap gun, etc).  They are well-deployed and brilliant.  Allen's dialogue is equally funny, the best line in the film being, ""After twenty minutes, I had decided I wanted to spend my entire life with her.  And after a half hour, I'd given up the idea of takin her purse"".
Yet, in his first film our schlemiel of a director is bound to run into difficulties.  At times it appears he is trying to hard to be funny.  Forced humor never works, and it works even less in Allen's case.  Some jokes just seem overdone.  Then the movie itself goes on for about a half hour too long.
Nevertheless, despite its flaws, this is a great movie of good comedic quality, and should not be dismissed merely because it lacks the artistic brilliance of Allen's later works.",979776000,,1209,4.660377358490566
3722,5,0764003828,"First, GET THIS MOVIE.  Then, take it home and gather your friends/family.  Then, push PLAY and laugh out loud for two hours!
After you're done, go out and RENT ""Annie Hall"", Woody's supposed ""masterpiece"".  If you CHUCKLE more than THREE times during ALL of ""Annie Hall"", then you got more out of it than I did!
I guess ""Take the Money . . ."" gets no respect because it makes no attempt to be an ""artistic"" nor ""important"" nor ""dramatic"" film - it's just terribly sweet and funny, period!  This is BY FAR my favorite Woody Allen film, or, more specifically, this is basically the ONE film Allen has made that makes me think he is actually funny.
Some will say that I just don't ""get"" Woody's other movies - the supposed explorations of loss, divorce, family life, etc. as seen through the eyes of a ""comic genius"" - and that ""Take the Money . . ."" pales by comparison in its simplicity and lack of depth.  To them, I say, ""Nuts"" because whenever Woody takes on a serious topic (as he does in most of his other movies) he obsesses, stresses, disects, whines, bitches, whimpers, cries and complains it to DEATH!  Trust me, Woody's ""genius"" is anything but - more like blatantly obvious, over-ambitious, self-indulgent ATTEMPTS at genius.  Honestly, there is nothing so UNfunny as someone TRYing (again and again and again . . . . YAWN) to be ""important"".
THIS is Woody best movie effort, hands down - if you want to be nagged, bored, insulted and left mentally barren, watch ""Annie Hall"" or any other of Woody's frustratingly droll movies.",967593600,8,1538,4.611721611721611
3723,4,0764003828,"NOTE:  This review applies to the version of this DVD published in 2000.  It may not apply to newer versions.  If you are buying this DVD new, IGNORE THIS REVIEW.  If you're buying it used, well then...

This is a review of the Take the Money and Run --  not the movie, but the DVD itself.  The movie  is a classic comedy that is appropriate  for kids of 10 and over, as well as adults.  If you've never seen it, the humor is a  riot even though it's over 30 years old.

The DVD was just released and  is a brilliant example of film restoration.  The color is  perfect, the  grain is almost invisible, and you couldn't hope for a better print.  The  two-sided disk has TV-format on one side and letterbox on the other, but  as the film was originally shot for TV the images are nearly identical.  There are a couple of extra items that you can access after the end of the  film, but they're typical stuff.

The sound of the first edition (printed 2000), however, leaves a lot to be  desired. It's essentially mono, which is what you'd expect for a late-60's  TV movie, but there are long intervals of noticeable hum.  If you have a  high-quality audio system, the 60-Hz hum sections are really annoying.  In  addition, there are a couple of key scenes where the voices have been so  severely  filtered that they sound quite unnatural. In a bizarre twist, the  defects are more noticeable on better speakers...and almost imperceptible  on a cheap TV speaker.  So, listen to this one on your crummiest TV and you  won't feel compelled to write reviews like this one!",963705600,24,1564,4.448398576512456

Film is full of gems : Allen being punished by being sent into a hole with  an insurance salesman, his humiliated parents wearing Groucho Marx masks to  disguise themselves and Allen's deadpan backhanded compliment to his  girlfriend: ""That's a nice hat...I see them all over town....Yeah,  they're on sale...in those big bins...millions of them.""

7788468,4,0764003828,"Hard to do the stars thing for certain films.  So, let me be clear - film itself gets five stars, transfer gets barely three - so I averaged it out.  Since very few here have actually reviewed the product that's for sale on this page, let me help:  The movie is, all these decades later, still hilarious.  Rough around the edges, but the jokes come fast and furious and it really only lags in the last fifteen minutes.  There is no modern comedy of the last decade or two that has these kinds of continuous and very intelligent laughs.  No toilet jokes, no menstruation jokes, no genitalia jokes - just really funny lines and situations.

The transfer: I love the guy who says this is the best this film can look on home video.  Really?  You know that how exactly?  You're an expert on films, film stock, color, and transfers.  This is an older transfer, clearly, and it looks like it.  It's way too soft in the long and medium shots and while it's grainy the grain does NOT provide the detail it should have.  Nor is the color right.  Why?  Because the transfer came from an internegative that was old and fading or that hadn't been graded properly.  If this had been done off the camera negative I think Mr. This Is the Best This Film Can Look on Home Video would be singing a whole different tune.

It's nice to have it on Blu-ray and the movie is worth it, but the transfer is barely adequate and it could look a zillion times better.",1520899200,,1438,4.345864661654136
