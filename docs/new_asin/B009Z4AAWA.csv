8545563,2,B009Z4AAWA,"Good performances, but is it really an endorsement for bathing suits ? Smart woman, who values intelligence  learns that she wants to be appreciated for her looks as well. Kinda swings that way too much, but what was I expecting from a beach movie !!  ??",1457827200,2,254,4.5
8545564,5,B009Z4AAWA,"This was a real throw-back movie to heyday at Jones Beach. Brought back many memories!
Black-n-white movie, with a cute, young Ronald Reagan and Virginia Mayo, both looking wonderful. Despite very dated attitudes, it is a cute and funny movie to take your mind off the way things are today. The stars had great chemistry and were sweet together. I can see why others have said Ronald Reagan loved acting in this movie.",1451001600,5,418,4.739726027397261
8545565,5,B009Z4AAWA,"Ronald Reagan, and 10 beautiful women. What more could you ask for?

Reagan is a pinup artist who has drawn the most beautiful woman ever. But he has a secret. He has 10 different models, each model has particularly good  anatomy in one part of her body. So, he uses the legs from one girl, the arms from another girl, the face from another girl, to create the perfect woman.

And of course things go comically wrong.

Highly recommend.

Glad to have this in my DVD / Blu-ray collection.",1446595200,5,487,4.426966292134831

8545568,5,B009Z4AAWA,"For fun and breezy pleasure, there is nothing not to like, either with the wonderfully unlikely plot or the solid cast. Circa 1949 was the lull after a long stretch of the Great Depression, World War 2, and America's entry into the war in Korea. As things stand today, a romp through an innocent series of events in the lives of three or four people is as beneficial as a weekend at a hot springs.",1362268800,10,397,4.306666666666667

- Donovan, despondently: ""I'm gonna throw myself off the Brooklyn Bridge.""
- Bill collector: ""Oh, sorry, I'm going to the Bronx.""

Not everyone can be a hit in Manhattan. Case in point, struggling talent agent Charles Patrick Donovan (Eddie Bracken) who copes with his nowhere career by threatening to kill himself every so often (but of course not following thru). Even his devoted girlfriend is getting tired of his act. Still, she points him to a possibly lucrative gig. New York's vitamin king intends to launch a television show and wants that elusive Randolph girl to be in it. If Donovan can land this magazine model, his get is 10% of $100,000.

Donovan mugs his way into the studio of commercial artist Bob Randolph (Ronald Reagan), and it turns out he's not the first agent to have tried to sign the Randolph girl to a contract. Bob Randolph firmly cuts off Donovan's sales pitch. Bob Randolph harbors a secret, and it's this: There isn't one Randolph girl. Instead, she's a composite of twelve models, and ""Each of the girls believes that she's the Randolph girl."" It doesn't help that Bob had been stepping out with each clueless gal. So it's not that Randolph is hating on Donovan's proposition, but you see his dilemma...

1949's THE GIRL FROM JONES BEACH came at a time when Ronald Reagan was at a low ebb. He'd just gone quits with actress Jane Wyman; his film career was flagging. His performance here was well received, a much needed boost in confidence. Reagan's selling point has always been his natural likability, and that's much in evidence onscreen. He cuts an amiable figure as he plays an immigr- oh, wait, we're not there yet...

Charles Patrick Donovan may be a low-rent agent but he proves to be undettered with this one. While on one of his ""suicide"" excursions - this time, on a boat to drown himself - he espies a sunbathing blonde beauty on Jones Beach, a girl who matches all the attributes of Randolph's composite girl. He's quick to bring her to Randolph's attention. From there, I'm sure you can go put two and two together.

Further nosing around reveals that the beach bombshell is Ruth Wilson (Virginia Mayo), demure 6th grade grammar school teacher who also teaches night school to educate new American immigrants. But here's the rub: Ruth Wilson is one of them conservative sorts, a girl who wants a man to prize her for her mind, not for her looks. She's holding out for intellectual companionship. There's only one in for Bob Randolph, and that's to pose as an immigrant from Pilsen, Czechoslovakia in her night classes. To give the film credit, Mayo's character is only gradually bowled over. She even addresses her new student's wandering accent: ""Your accent seems to slide all over Europe."" Still, this is the gipper at work. He eventually has her agreeing that there is a time for thoughts, but also a time for a well-turned calf.

THE GIRL FROM JONES BEACH is often funny, and it's clever. It spotlights Reagan's light touch and reaffirms Eddie Bracken as a marvelous comic performer. If you're the low brow sort, Bracken's sad sack antics meet your requirement. If you're the high brow sort, maybe you'll appreciate the frequent banter in quotes engaged by Reagan and the curvy Mayo. Virginia Mayo, needless to say, looks absolutely stunning in that white bathing suit. No wonder her schoolteacher character went to court over it. It's practically illegal, she looks so good. I guess it matters that Mayo and Reagan exhibit a nice chemistry.

Not too astonishly, Charles Patrick Donovan, low-rent talent agent, ends up not killing himself.",1358553600,9,3639,4.803514376996805
