7848284,5,6303451179,"Year-round family movie. Interesting and unusual.

The plot, dialogue, acting, storyline is all very good, and it addresses multiple audience maturity levels. Five stars!

Even more importantly this movie is about sacrifice, and love, and character.

The heroes are the children. The ('good' guys) grownups are also supportive and worthy influences.

But it is not 'Barney', or just plain goody-goody pretending, like one might think, from it's title.

There are some difficult decisions and circumstances to be overcome.

It really is (or should be) a modern classic.

It encourages self-examination, and proving of true character that just supercedes the current 'family' contemporary (aka disney).",1144195200,2,700,5.673076923076923
7848285,5,6303451179,"This is a wonderful low-budget movie filmed in English in Yugoslavia in 1988 about a boy who wants to buy a new pair of ice skates to compete in the annual competition.  Along the way, he comes across a truly magical  snowman with the voice of Roger Moore, and a sinister fishing boat captain.  The scenery is quite beautiful and the acting very special in an  un-Hollywood kind of way. Though technically not a Christmas movie, I would  put it in that category because of its' message. This is a very good movie  for children between the ages of 6 and 12 but is captivating enough for the  whole family to enjoy.",943747200,21,613,4.419642857142857
