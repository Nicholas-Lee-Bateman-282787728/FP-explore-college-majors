2442417,5,B000BTPVAE,"Known to many for his popular TV shows as far back as the 1950's, this is a long-lost Good Friday sermon from Bishop Sheen's last Good Friday on this earth.  It is an inspiring sermon, full of Bishop Sheen's wit, wisdom and theology.  Like all of his work, it is faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church.

The extra features on this DVD, while understandably not an eye-popper in this day of CG animation and million-dollar stunts, it does show interesting tidbits about his life, ministry, etc.

I highly recommend this for all Catholics.  Most of his work should be on the ""Must See"" list for all Catholics.

However, during his lifetime, Bishop Sheen found a great following among non-Catholics too.  His work was enjoyed by people as diverse as Rev. Billy Graham, Dr. Robert Schuller and actor Martin Sheen.  In the 1950's, he even won an Emmy!  Therefore, I can also recommend it for anyone who has had the pleasure of enjoying Bishop Sheen's work in the past, as well as theology students of any stripe.",1212624000,15,1017,4.668539325842697

8092952,5,B000BTPVAE,"In addition to his keen insights as both priest and scholar, the late Fulton Sheen was a precious and gentle soul who can - through these DVDs that have survived him - continue to leave you laughing at his jokes one minute and deeply moved by his life lessons and observations of our world and where it's headed the next. His sermons are as relevant today as when they first aired.",1397606400,,381,4.380281690140845

his way to Sainthood!
If you enjoy the bishop you will Love this perspective
of a great Man literally months prior to his passing.
Bishop Sheen loves Christ and has a Great devotion
to our Holy Mother.
 I Love this man and ask for his intercession daily,
 as well as praying for the cause of his in Rome.
Please understand this man is a gift to humanity.",1368835200,2,406,4.259740259740259
8092955,5,B000BTPVAE,"Bishop Fulton Sheen, now Servant of God, is one of the best communicators of God's Word in the 20th century.  He preached God in the pulpit of the Church, in the radio, television and the print media.  His sermons are steeped in God's Word confronting the modern world that is becoming God-less yet idolizing one's own freedom, and immoral yet legal.  The Passion, Death and Resurrection of Christ are the main themes of his Good Friday Sermon in 1979.  Bishop Sheen's Good Friday sermon reminds that we cannot appreciate the Resurrection of Christ by detaching Christ from the Cross.  This is a good dvd source for retreats in this Lenten Season!",1300579200,8,647,4.792792792792793
