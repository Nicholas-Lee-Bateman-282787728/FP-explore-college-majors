3688306,5,B001LNOLNC,Oh how I love this film and Victor Buono. He may be my favorite actor of all time. I won't go into a review of the film here since another reviewer has already done a beautiful job of that. What I will review is the quality of this Sinister Cinema release of the Strangler. This was previously released by AMC on a double feature monsterfest DVD. That was a very poor release and this one isn't much better. Sure the audio is improved and so is the shaky picture somewhat but this is still a rather poor looking transfer. Sinister Cinema did do the fans of this film a favor by making it available on DVD-R but we will still have to wait for a proper release with better picture and audio.,1409184000,2,689,4.2272727272727275
3688307,4,B001LNOLNC,"All that and fame can get you anything.  Victor Buono stepped into the starring role of this modest, lively shocker after he hit the big time co-starring in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" receiving an AAN for Best supporting actor.  He later appeared in that film's sequel or sorts ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" and received immortality on the Batman TV series playing villain ""King Tut.""  He did not have the trappings of being particularly handsome or of a good build, as he was considered obese and otherwise unassuming.  But he could play it violent and director Burt Topper and writer Bill S. Ballinger capitalize on that in their ""The Strangler.""  Satisfying the fans from his ""Baby Jane"" success, there is even included a quasi-fetish about baby dolls that accompanies his lurid, but strangely sexually unsatisfying killings.  The film also tries to take some credit from the newspaper headlines of the Boston Strangler with a disclaimer at the beginning claiming the similarity was less than coincidental.  Ellen Corby plays the mother and others in the cast are less well known but memorable like David McLean, Diane Sayer and Davey Davison as ""Tally"" the love interest and others.  It was an Allied Artists release, that great little studio that has brought us, rather unassumingly, some fine minor classics.  Sinister Cinema has brought this DVD-R pressing to us and as typical with them they want us to believe it was made from the best possible quality source material, but it remains questionable as is typical with their output it is pretty raggedy.  Of course, in black and white.  The writing and direction are extremely good.  Buono, once again, is excellent, bringing much pathos to an otherwise unsympathetic role.",1373414400,3,1738,5.080985915492958
3688308,3,B001LNOLNC,"The story was creepy enought, but of course, it was dated.  Some of the terms sounded funny to me, e.g. schizo instead of psychopath.  Buono was very good.",1358035200,,155,4.5
3688309,3,B001LNOLNC,"Very good early-60s shocker -- targeted to the teenage drive-in audience and following the era's trend of exposing psychological motivation beneath the surface of serial killers' appalling acts of violence.  Victor Buono plays the title role in a low-key manner, a big departure from his usual over-the-top performances such as King Tut in Batman or Count Manzeppi in Wild,Wild West -- and does it effectively. Film's major weakness is lack of talented players; only Ellen Corby (Grandma in The Waltons) gives Buono any support in his scenes.  I've never heard of the director, Harry Horner, but he does a fine enough job to make the viewer wonder if a high-profile director hadn't done the work under an alias.",1349913600,4,711,5.016949152542373

8319120,4,B001LNOLNC,Pretty good killer-on-the-loose film with Victor Buono as the killer on the loose.  He plays a screw loose killer with serious mom issues.  Who can blame him for the issues with the nagging little harridan he was born to.  Nurses are his preferred target.  Buono does a good job here.  I ordered a Warner Archives used copy DVD-R and it has some glitches.  That's the chance you take when you buy used.  Other than that the quality of the DVD-R is very good.  Film itself is highly recommended.,1450310400,3,494,4.534090909090909
8319121,4,B001LNOLNC,"The Strangler,"" released in 1964, capitalized on the then-current (then unsolved) Boston Strangler murders. Leon Kroll (Victor Buono, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?), a paranoid schizophrenic with a mother fixation and a doll fetish, murders ten women in Boston before the police take him down. Kroll is a 30-year-old bachelor whose domineering mother (Ellen Corby) has raised him alone. Her constant put-downs have given him a case of low esteem and a consuming hatred of women. Leon hates his mother and is pleased that she has been in a sanitarium the last two years for heart trouble allowing him to stalk and dispatch his victims without maternal interference.

Director Burt Topper provides a disturbing portrait of Kroll, a hospital lab technician who equates his dolls with his victims. The character is an amalgam of Norman Bates, Charles Manson, and Jack the Ripper. Krolls corpulence, dispassionate expression, and preoccupation with dolls make him a creepy villain in this lurid tale of crazed homicidal obsession.

This was a rare starring role for Buono, who usually played supporting roles in feature films and TV shows. Buono is reminiscent of Laird Cregar, a 1940s actor who took on similarly dark roles, such as Jack the Ripper in The Lodger and a crazed classical musician in Hangover Square. Both men were similar physically and in their ability to suggest a loner with lethal tendencies. Buono would later go on to play King Tut on the Batman TV show. Ellen Corby would play gentle, loving Grandma Walton on The Waltons. There are no bonus features on this DVD release.",1449014400,,1592,5.026515151515151
8319122,5,B001LNOLNC,"Victor Buono got a rare starring role in this mid-sixties shocker, in which he portrays a man with serious Mother issues.  Nurses are being killed by a serial strangler, and Buono eventually comes under suspicion.  He's actually the killer, a fact known to the audience from the beginning.  After playing creepy supporting roles in WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE, Buono acquits himself well in this slightly-ahead-of-its-time portrait of a serial killer.

The new MOD from Warner Archives offers a superior print when compared to recent sightings of the film from Sinister Cinema and the TCM network.  The image is presented in anamorphic widescreen 1:85-1.",1447718400,2,691,5.302752293577981
8319123,5,B001LNOLNC,I have this movie on VHS.  Victor Buono is superb as a twisted psycho  mama's boy.  He secretly loathes his mother who demands his love and loyalty to her.  Mama  demeans her son and lectures him about the evils of women in an effort to control him and keep him all to herself.  It seems to have worked for a good many years and mother is wearing on his nerves.  He longs for true love and a life of his own - away from mother.,1431475200,,427,3.9529411764705884
