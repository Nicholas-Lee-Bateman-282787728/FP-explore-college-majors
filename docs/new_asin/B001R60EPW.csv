8337485,1,B001R60EPW,"A group of friends spend their last summer the have before entering adulthood by....staying at home and having fairly lame parties, full of sexual stories of past escapades and hitting on girls. Oh those wild ones.

This movie is full of frank sex talk that i'd guess is supposed to be humorous, but the movie isn't on for long before it just becomes boring and tedious. It seems that the writer of this was attempting to channel old-school Kevin Smith but lacked the ability to successfully pull it off. What we get is an overlong, unfunny, exercise in tedium.

8337487,5,B001R60EPW,"I have watched ""Kicking The Dog"" a couple times and it just gets better.  I repeat most lines from the movie on a daily basis. The soundtrack is unbeatable, I just love The Pawnshop Roses.
I was thrilled to find t-shirts at kickingthedog.com
If your looking for a great laugh, this is the movie to buy!",1242691200,,302,4.392857142857143
8337488,5,B001R60EPW,"I think the movie is hilarious!

The boobs are NOT fake, the right nipple is just a little crooked.  If it was a boobjob, they would have straightened it during surgery.  People will complain about everything - even awesome, real, large breasts.

I love the soundtrack too.",1242604800,3,273,4.74468085106383
8337489,1,B001R60EPW,"Aside from the cover art having nothing to do with the movie (none of the people pictured are in it - including the dog or the house), the title being irrelevant to the story, the plot description repeating the ""12 friends"" line when there was 9, this could be decent.

You get 90 minutes of guys and girls talking about their sexcapades, drinking and trying to sleep with each other. There is a subplot involving one of the guys working in a porn shop, which is what gives this the R rating, otherwise the remainder takes place at one house over the course of a weekend.

A few laugh out loud moments, a lot of stupid idiots drinking, etc. One of those movies you might play as background at a party that no one is really watching, but would grab a view when the token fake boobs (really bad augmentation too) pop out a couple times. No special features, and film quality was poor to average. 5 star reviews? Please.",1240704000,4,917,4.3882352941176475
8337490,5,B001R60EPW,"Really funny movie, kind of like American Pie meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  The leads are great, and Elizabeth Schmidt is HOT!",1234224000,,133,4.782608695652174
8337491,5,B001R60EPW,"This movie is great! A comedy cult classic. Not to sound like a tool, but I repeat the quotes all the time. The one liners are hilarious, but it's not a one trick pony. The movie is just funny from start to finish. Definately an ""OWNER"" for the video library.",1233964800,,259,4.2
