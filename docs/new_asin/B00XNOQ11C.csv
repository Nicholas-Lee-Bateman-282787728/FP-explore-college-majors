8716359,5,B00XNOQ11C,"This Blu-Ray of this movie is superb. I was hesitant to order it at first because it was from Italy (I live in the US) and didn't know what their methods would be for transferring to Blu-Ray. I thought they might just take the DVD version and transfer it to a Blu-Ray disk. This is NOT what they did. They obviously used the original cut from the film because the result is excellent. The colors jump out at you. The sound is excellent as well. The dialogue is in English.

I have included some screen shots as a comparison. One is taken from the Blu-ray the other from the DVD. I own both.

The only problem you need to worry about is if it will play in your Blu-Ray player. Read the warnings in the product details. I used my friends computer that has software that will read any Blu-Ray so I didn't have a problem. But consider this seriously before purchasing.",1449187200,2,864,4.327160493827161
