The film starts not far removed from the movie Cobra before turning into Tango and Cash before finally settling into a Die Hard mold. They even got some nice Hard to Kill shout outs for those Steven Seagal fans out there. It's good fun especially if you're a fan of the aforementioned movies. It's also interesting in the way they change things. It's not bank robbers and cultists who are the issue. It's Pakistani terrorists. However, it's not a movie that is taking it all that serious. These are Pakistani terrorists who are defeated by particularly terrible drag routines.

It's not a great film. It won't convert anyone over to watching Bollywood films either. It's a ton of fun though for anyone who's into this sort of thing.",1505865600,,789,4.635714285714286
8186797,3,B000OV02WQ,"3.5 starts, if for the only reason that features Aamir Khan in drag (which is priceless). Otherwise, a good solid showing, but aside from the aforementioned cross-dressing, nothing too memorable; similar to but not quite the depth and complexity as Sarfaroosh.",1449619200,,260,5.365853658536586
8186798,5,B000OV02WQ,Filled with lots of action . Aamir Khan is excellent in his part as a commando cop. Music was fun too. If you like Indian movies with lots of fight scenes this is the movie for you. Dvd worked well.,1331251200,,198,3.975
