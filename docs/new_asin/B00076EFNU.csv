8044833,4,B00076EFNU,"If you are intrigued by local low budget filmakers and are in search for a ""different"" sort of film, then I recommend you get this DVD. Remember it is not a major production, but it has some major themes and messages embedded deeply into the scenes. This is a humourous film with heavy tones. A ""should see""! Besides, the people who collaborated to make this Indiana Film are great and deserve the support!",1104192000,,406,4.575342465753424
