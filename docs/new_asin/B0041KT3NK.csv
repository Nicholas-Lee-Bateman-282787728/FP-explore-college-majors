4245726,2,B0041KT3NK,"A beautifully photographed travelogue of modern day Egypt superimposed on a rather flimsy love story that lacks any semblance of interest or suspense.  As a result, this film is long and draggy.  The female lead is physically unattractive and a tad too old for her role.  The male lead is grizzled, sweaty and underweight.  Although it presents a few cultural insights, this movie is not a very good use of your time.",1294358400,5,417,4.75
4245727,5,B0041KT3NK,"I felt deeply satisfied after watching "" Cairo Time "", a different , tender love story between an american woman visiting the arab metropolis and an egyptian gentleman who used to work for her husband . Canadian/Syrian director Ruba Nadda allows her leads to get carried away by the breathtaking beauty of the city they wander but doesn't turn a blind eye to it's harsh realities : a visit to a carpet factory in which only underage children work , as picturesque as it might look at first glance , is a striking social comment .
Above all though , what stays with the viewer is the discreet romance between her two charismatic leads . As Juliette , Patricia Clarkson brings a very quiet , introspective tone to the character and her very balanced measurement of feelings in the perfomance is truly remarkable . Nadda has said that she wrote the part of Tareq specifically for Alexander Siddig and her choice has payd off : his good manners ,honesty and noble spirit will make female viewers swoon and i was particularly impressed with his last scene at the hotel lounge which i found particularly moving . Overall , this is a rare gem of a film : modest and sensual , slow-paced and witty  . Highly recommended !",1293667200,3,1213,4.564220183486238
4245728,5,B0041KT3NK,"So I haven't reviewed a movie in a while because very rarely will a movie move me to actually review it.  I mean, I like movies but not as much as I like books.  However, this movie was just so beautifully done that I had to share about it.

This is a Canadian independent film that was directed by Rubba Nadda and stars Patricia Clarkson and Alexander Siddig. Patricia Clarkson plays Juliette, a Canadian journalist who arrives in Cairo in order to vacation with her husband who is a UN official in Gaza.  Her husband has been delayed so he asks his friend, Tareq (played by Siddig) to be her guide and protector in Cairo until he can escape from his duties to vacation with her. Juliette finds herself falling in love with Cairo but also with Tareq, much to her surprise.

Now, I've never been to Cairo, although I really want to go there someday but this movie made me believe that I had a really good feel for the city - its people, its traffic, its mosques and its coffee shops. And yes, even the pyramids, although I'm sure that it won't be the same as sitting there and feeling the dust or smelling the pyramids themselves. It's very elegant and masterfully done and the acting was absolutely beautiful to watch.  Highly recommended.",1293321600,,1240,4.488888888888889
4245729,5,B0041KT3NK,"A previous review described it beautifully when they said it's more of a poem than a movie. The story gently rolls along, and expertly captures the subtleties of human emotion. The cinematography is really fantastic and  along with very skillful acting, makes the experience of the movie a breathtaking one. Cairo is as much a main character as the actors themselves, and the vast landscape shots along with those that zero-in on the mundane details of life in Cairo, together give you a what feels like a very real experience of Cairo. I'm now looking forward to seeing more movies by this writer/director.",1293321600,,607,4.893203883495145
4245730,1,B0041KT3NK,"A total waste of the talents of Patricia Clarkson and the others involved in this project.  As a travelogue, it makes me want to visit Cairo - perhaps it was financed by the Egyptian government?  I have been to Cairo, and it is nothing like this - this is the sugar-coated version, a little like the image of Tokyo one gets from Lost in Translation.  Cairo is teeming with homeless, poverty-stricken people, as is all of Egypt.  But all we see here are genteel sophisticates.  The plot is predictable and emotionally detached - we never really care about these characters, only their clothes and their luggage seems to matter to the director. This is trash of the first order. Don't believe the hype.  It's not worth $18.99.",1292630400,7,724,4.661417322834645
4245731,5,B0041KT3NK,"I loved every minute of this film and plan to see it again.  The movie is not only a wonderful portrait of Cairo and its people, it touches on the contrasts of US and Egyptian culture. There is a light romance, the kind you know can never be.

First, there is the visual beauty of Cairo. In the print I saw the the color was not great, but this did not diminish the beauty of the city or the people. The street scenes, Tareq's coffee house, the Corniche, Khan el-Khalili, the Nile, Ramses Station, the traffic, the desert, the mosque, the wedding etc. were all true to my experience of Egypt.

Then there is the beauty of the people. When Juliette asks why no one has asked her to leave the men only coffee house, Tareq says ""It would be rude"". When she says the men are following her his friend says ""You are a beautiful woman.""  This courtesy and easy grace characterized the Egyptian people I knew. The people in national dress from many parts of Africa, the many styles of hijab and galabaya reflected the diversity and spirit of Cairo. It reminds you that Egypt has been a melting pot since long before the US was even conceived.

Then there was the contrast of culture. Julliette can not imagine possible dangers for her regarding the letter she has delivered. She is surprised at the reactions to her daughter's degree and her son's elopement. Tareq accepts that the girls in the carpet schools are saving for their weddings and Julliette sees exploitation. When Juliette's husband finally arrives he looks scruffy and overly casual compared to the immaculate and formal Tareq.

My only criticism is about Juliette's wardrobe. The low necklines of the gown and the bathrobe don't fit the style of the film. Juliette was an intelligent woman. After a day in Cairo, why would she wear such a sheer skirt to a mosque?

If you love Cairo and the Egyptian people, you will love especially love this movie.",1292284800,3,1907,4.591176470588235
4245732,4,B0041KT3NK,"""Cairo Time"" seems to be inspired by the restraint of silver screen romances of the 1940s. ""Casablanca"" comes to mind for Ingrid Bergman's passionate but loyal and decorous character -and for the exoticism of that Moroccan city. ""Cairo Time"" is a romantic drama, however, without political intrigue or action. The action is in the characters' emotions, but they are rarely expressed overtly. Juliette Grant (Patricia Clarkson) is a magazine editor whose husband works for the United Nations in Gaza. She has traveled to Cairo to meet him for a romantic vacation, but he has been delayed due to unrest in Gaza. So Tareq (Alexander Siddig), an Egyptian former colleague, meets Juliette at the airport and gets her settled into her hotel.

The city of Cairo is a big part of this film, with all of its chaos, beauty, poverty, ancient wonders and modern skyscrapers, both Western and Eastern, Muslim and secular.  Writer and director Ruba Nadda, an Arab Canadian, references the city's relaxed pace in the title ""Cairo Time"", and she has adopted that pace for the film. But it's not dull. The film is only 90 minutes long. It's just not frenzied, as that would be out of place in the extreme heat and languorous Mediterranean culture. Juliette is going stir crazy at the hotel with nothing to do but worry about her husband, so she sets out to explore. At first alone, but when it becomes clear that is a challenge for a blond woman in an Arab city, Tareq becomes her guide.

The adventure catches Juliette when her role is changing. Her children have left home. She's come a long way to be closer to her husband, but, for the moment, those plans have fallen through. Tareq is a man who is very familiar with Western ways, having worked for the UN, but he has a traditionalist streak. Juliette and Tareq make a gracious and handsome pair. Though the focus is more on Juliette's inner life during this time, I like Alexander Siddig's performance a lot. I'm not used to seeing a lot of subtlety from him, but what Tareq would never say shows on his face and in his tone: his effort to balance his annoyance with Western self-righteousness, his attraction to his friend's wife, his essentially liberal nature, and the traditions that are his identity.

The DVD (MPI 2010): Bonus features are a ""Making of"" documentary, a Q&A session, 4 short films written and directed by Ruba Nadda, a theatrical trailer (2 min), 1 deleted scene (3 min), and an audio commentary. In the ""Making of"" documentary (7 min), Ruba Nadda talks about why she made the film, the cast, and filming in Cairo. ""Toronto Q&A"" (26 min) is a September 2009 panel discussion with the director, Patricia Clarkson, and Alexander Siddig. The audio commentary is by writer/director Ruba Nadda and cinematographer Luc Montpellier. They talk about the 25-day shoot in Cairo, scene by scene, the challenges of different etiquette and regulations in Cairo, locations, themes, pacing. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH and Spanish.",1291248000,9,3000,4.842105263157895
4245733,3,B0041KT3NK,"This film has its strengths and its weaknesses. It is about a North American liberal woman who has come to Cairo Egypt to meet with her UN employed husband who is negotiation in Gaza. Unfortunately her husband is not able to break away from the conflict to join his wife and so she has been left alone. Thus to some extent the movie is about a woman traveling alone in an Islamic country and the cultural differences that both attract her and some which threaten her. Her husband's former employee, Tarek, now retired, is her companion while her husband is detained, opening many doors for her, including romance. The film also explores the concept that when we are in a different culture, feeling alone and isolated, and also feeling somewhat vulnerable, that our decisions and thoughts are not typical and we may act in a way that we would not under our normal circumstances.  The strength of having two characters over 50 years old is that sometimes more experienced people recognize these circumstances and are able to reconnect with former lives and attachments. The city of Cairo was beautiful and the film made me want to visit someday. The Nile River, which played a major visual role in the film, was stunning. There is a scene as to how Egyptian young men would respond to a blond North American woman walking the streets alone. They assumed they could seduce her and that she was sexually available, which highly threatened Juliette. But Juliette continues to explore. Sometimes this results in beauty and insight, especially the wonderful scene where she goes into an ancient mosque to see and hear the chanter's beautiful call to prayer. Sometimes her loneliness leads to problems, such as the scene where she tries to pass into Gaza and is turned back by the Israeli military border guards. The music throughout the film was very good, making me curious as to whether there is a soundtrack.

Patricia Clarkson, playing the role of Juliette, is superb and as a great beauty now reaching age 50 she was perfect for the part. Alexander Siddig, playing Tarek, is also a good actor; sometimes however I felt he overplayed the role. There was something not quite right with his role; he seemed too physically close to Juliette too soon, which was a bit out of character.

There were some weaknesses to the film. Tarek seemed a bit naive about Western North American culture which seemed out of character for a man who retired as an employee of the UN. The film was not a political statement, but a romantic statement about romance and vulnerability among those old enough to understand and reflect upon their feelings.",1285977600,18,2626,4.792494481236203
4245734,5,B0041KT3NK,"I completely disagree with the previous review. I found the movie delightful. The film brought back many memories of Cairo and Egypt (and Arab men) for me. There is also the experience of a woman traveling alone rather than traveling with a companion or family. I recognized many of the experiences that Juliette had as captured by the exquisite acting of Patricia Clarkson. I had no idea what an excellent actress she is. I especially loved the slow development of the relationship between Juliette and Tarek, played by Alexander Siddig. Hopefully, the film industry will cast Siddig in more romantic leads (if thats what he wants).
The movie did just scratch the surface on several little subplots but it did not get weighed down by them and kept to the theme of friendship and romance developing while a woman waits (unaccompanied) in Cairo. The music was beautiful as well. I recommend the movie (unless you only like action films) and I suggest checking out ""The Making of Cairo Time"" on Youtube for a little more background on the film and director. (Its an art film and a romance film.)",1284940800,54,1093,4.788359788359788
4245735,1,B0041KT3NK,"Cairo Time is the single most unintentionally hilarious movie I've seen to date. The acting was so flat, forced, and insipid, the characters and their dialog so implausible, the chemistry between the two leads so absent, as to verge on incoherence. At one point, Tareq, the male lead, a worldly former UN employee, fluent in English, asks Juliette, the female lead--his voice brimming with earnest disbelief--""would people really want to read an article about Egyptian street children?"" This is where you learn that Cairo Time takes place in an alternate reality where the existence of Save the Children-type advertising has been painstakingly concealed from the Third World. The film went from promising to painful-to-watch to hilarious within the first forty minutes. The only characters who felt the least bit believable were the Egyptian extras--men in a cafe, a Bedouin family--and their all-too-brief moments of ease and naturalness just reinforced how awful the rest of the movie was.

What made things even worse were the many signs that the screenwriter sincerely intended to make this a thoughtful, subtle movie. The casting of middle-aged female lead Patricia Clarkson, the depiction of sexual harassment on Egyptian streets and the hostility of Israeli border guards, and the un-melodramatic love story plot are all commendable. But somewhere along the way, it all went horribly and hilariously wrong. Maybe the problem was that, in keeping with the un-melodramatic spirit of the movie, they tried to handle all of these serious issues with a light touch. What they ended up doing was to trivialize them, hinting now and again at a new source of trouble for one of the characters, and in short order completely forgetting about it, drifting back into the soporific dialog between the two leads. Nothing in the movie conveyed any sense of urgency, even when it clearly ought to have. Manic, beautiful Cairo was reduced to a saccharine mirage (yeah...) stripped of grit and conspicuously lacking all of the little ways a tourist-flooded and somewhat impoverished megalopolis expresses its cynicism to over-eager starry-eyed foreigners. The Egyptian characters were earnest, naive, and un-self-aware to a degree that it actually made their interactions hard to follow.

I guess you could be generous and interpret this cloying, romantic view of Cairo as a fourth wall-breaking projection of Juliette's own naive and romantic view of the city, in the same way that the camera lingering on the quivering bosoms and apple-round buttocks of various female actresses in Sex Trek: Penetrations was a cinematic device symbolizing the male protagonist's lust. This is sometimes called ""pornography"".

Actually, maybe that's the best way to describe what this movie was. Trying to tell a story about a woman falling in love with a city she is visiting as a tourist, the film maker saw nothing wrong with making everything, from characters' personalities and dialog to the narrative, fall in line with Juliette's enchanted escapism. A beautiful young woman on a bus to starving, semi-regularly bombarded Gaza is about to drop out of college because her boyfriend got her pregnant? Who cares! Cairo is beautiful! Young, handsome street toughs and charming, sophisticated older men alike practically throw themselves at Juliette's feet, struck by her beauty. Captain Kirk, move over!

And on top of everything else, the plot was a mess. A multitude of subplots all turned out to be complete dead ends and failed to pull together, even in an indirect, thematic way. This review explains in detail:

[...].

This could have been a really great movie if about half the script were rewritten, and if the writer had any idea how to write a believable Middle Eastern male character, and the director wasn't taking orders from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism.",1284595200,9,3850,5.201612903225806

4245775,5,B0041KT3NK,"This is a very moving, beautifully acted, brief love story.  It was so good after I saw my local library version that I felt I had to get a copy to keep for myself and lend to family and friends.  Two people who would only have had a superficial relationship in ordinary circumstances were unexpectedly placed in more intimate surroundings, and they both very hesitantly responded.  It is a quiet and very subtle and wonderful movie which I don't want to tell too much about in this review.  It is best to see it and savor it.

What I really was amazed about was the relationship between an American woman and an Arabic man because, a rare occurrence in Hollywood film, the man was portrayed as a full, well-rounded, mostly positive  human being.  We almost always see negative portrayals of Arabic men which is so common that when the true image is shown, it is hard to believe this film is American.  Of course, it helped that the director was an  Arab woman and the actors were multiethnic - real Arabs played the appropriate roles.  I can't recommend this film more highly, and I wish there were more honest and thoughtful films like it.  I think we would have a more peaceful world if that were so.",1419638400,2,1203,4.497695852534562

Stunning location. I couldn't write that enough. I am way to much of a pansy to ever go by myself so I admire Juliette's bravery as she explores a bit on her own. Her stumble into a men's cafe was light and humorous. She is a little quiet and reserved and I found that somewhat frustrating. Tareq was a wonderful character. I adored him. He was very gentle and respectful. Intriguing too.

8412982,4,B0041KT3NK,"Patricia Clarkson is the master of using slow, delicate movements to convey a feeling or set a mood.  So she does not disappoint.  However, this film was perhaps just a little too slow.  I thought from the beginning that her husband was going to be a non-existent character in the film.  So I was surprised when he actually showed up, and the timing of his arrival was impeccable.  Nonetheless, the romance didn't begin until about 2/3 of the way through, which did make the film seem like it dragged a bit, and their romance felt unfinished, which was unsatisfying.  Lastly, Patricia Clarkson was in ""Learning to Drive"" with Ben Kingsly, which seemed too similar to this film.  So I would like to see Patricia Clarkson expand her roles more, though of course, she might not have many options, since unfortunately Hollywood is not so generous with roles for women in her age range, no matter how amazing they are.",1495584000,,913,4.70440251572327

I kept waiting for something--anything!--that would make me care what happened to the characters, but it was not to be. Every single opportunity to engage the viewer was squandered to the point where it all became a boring, annoying tease.",1493942400,,304,4.754716981132075
