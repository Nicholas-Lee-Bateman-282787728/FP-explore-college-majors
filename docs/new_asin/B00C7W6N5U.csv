I like the actress, she also stars in another movie that's equally as good if not better called ""200 Pounds Beauty"" which is actually still on Amazon Prime. ""My Sassy Girl"" is another great movie, nothing to do with this one though, just a recommendation.

More people need to get into reading subtitles, they miss out on gems when they refuse to watch subtitled movies. Some of the best movies are outside of a persons language.",1482019200,,472,4.686746987951807

8578481,5,B00C7W6N5U,"I watched this movie as a whim on a weekend. It was a quirky and humorous stumble upon gem. I watch a lot of Korean movies and dramas and this is one of my favorites, right next to Love Undercover.",1377388800,2,197,3.95
8578482,5,B00C7W6N5U,"I have watched this movie 5 times in the last week.  I can't remember laughing so hard in a movie for a very very long time.  To top it off, it's a fantastic love story too.  Can't say enough good about it.  I love it so much I have to own it. Ji Sung can do more with a twitch of his facial muscles or the blink of his eyes than all the comedians standing on a stage begging for laughs could dream of.  Love him lots.  Great Great actor. I wish lots and lots of people will love this movie and buy it too!",1369526400,4,506,3.7714285714285714
