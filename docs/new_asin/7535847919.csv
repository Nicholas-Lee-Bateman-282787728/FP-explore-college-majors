7899855,5,7535847919,"""Paisan"" consists of several short films, linked by the common theme of American soldiers interacting with the local Italian population during the Allied invasion. Made barely a year after the depicted events took place, the war was certainly fresh in the minds of the actors and extras, giving the interactions almost a documentary feel, enhanced by the introductions at the start of each segment, taken from actual war footage, that explain the following scenes' context.

The episodes show the progression from initial suspicion to acceptance and real collaboration. In the first one, a Sicilian girl agrees to guide a group of American soldiers through a minefield; an encounter with German troops leads to confusion and tragedy. In the second, an unlikely friendship blossoms between a black American MP and an Italian street urchin, leading to the MP's shock at how the conditions the child has endured surpass in brutality anything he has experienced himself. The third concerns a romance between an American soldier and an Italian prostitute. In the fourth, an American nurse, who wants to track down a former lover, an artist who has become a partisan leader, accompanies a wounded Italian man trying to reach the other side of Florence to search for his family. Their devotion to their individual objectives inadvertently leads to a guard's death.

The fifth episode concerns three American chaplains who visit a monastery. One of them, a Catholic priest, speaks Italian and is able to converse with the monks. He must deal with the monks' surprise and concern when they discover that the other two chaplains are a Lutheran minister and a rabbi. In the final episode, American soldiers cooperate with Italian partisans against the Germans in the final months of the war. In a aupplementary discussion by Rossellini specialist Adriano Apr, the film is described as an expression of how at the close of the war, the Italians, who had been virtually cut off from the outside world, deal with the intrusion of the unknown American invading force. The theme of the ""other"" is evident; Apr points out that the dialect of the Sicilians in the first episode would have been difficult even for other Italians to understand without subtitles. He also explained a theme that would have been obvious to an Italian viewer but obscure to anyone else. The action in the episodes follows the liberation of Italy, moving from south to north, a recapitulation of Garibaldi's progress during the Risorgimento 80 years earlier.

Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is the worst I have seen so far from Criterion. The Italian dialog is subtitled, but not the English; a serious flaw since no effort whatsoever was made to remaster the soundtrack, which is universally muddy and indistinct. The English dialog is difficult to follow, and at one point, a German soldier's pronouncements are almost incomprehensible. If it were a direct VCR-to-DVD transfer, this would be expected, but since they went to the trouble of adding bonus material, it's inexcusable, especially for a film of this caliber.  Five stars for the film itself, two for the presentation.",1403395200,,3140,5.103112840466926
7899856,3,7535847919,"In PAISAN, (1946), a 120-minute, black and white classic of Italian cinema, we can continue to see legendary director Roberto Rossellini invent Italian neo-realism on the screen; he had to, as, at the time he was working, Italy was nearly destroyed by World War II bombing, there was very little infrastructure left, and it was hard to get film, filmmaking equipment - and everything else.  Thus, the director worked with natural light and sound.

The war drama, the second film in the director's war trilogy, follows on from the landmark&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome-Open-City/dp/B002X9CIZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome, Open City</a>&nbsp;- it was made a year later-- to continue the director's depiction of Italy at the end of the war.  In six vignettes, it follows the allied invasion of the country, from south to north from July 1943 to winter 1944.  It begins in Sicily, where a young girl who is helping  American soldiers navigate a local minefield is killed.  Thence to Naples, where an orphaned local boy steals the shoes from a sleeping-it-off black American MP, who tracks him to a shantytown. To Rome, where an American GI meets a lovely young woman the day the Americans liberate Rome: six months later they meet again; he is cynical, she is a prostitute.  In Florence, an American nurse braves a dangerous trip across the Arno in a doomed search for the partisan leader she loves. (In this episode, we meet a very young - and uncredited-- Giulietta Masina, who would grow into one of Italy's greatest actresses,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juliet-Of-The-Spirits-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005V6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juliet Of The Spirits (The Criterion Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nights-Of-Cabiria/dp/B006H8JNNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nights Of Cabiria</a>, as an unidentified young woman on the palace stairs.)  In Monte Casino, for which the allied and axis forces battled the longest, from January to May 1944, the arrival of three U.S. Army chaplains, including a Protestant and a Jew, upsets a local monastery.  Finally, in the northern marshes of the Po River, which waters both Milan and Venice, we find Allied soldiers and partisans seamlessly working together.

This is an ambitious, moving film, now available here for the first time in its full original release version.  But one caveat: while we get subtitles for the Italians, we get none for the Americans.  And natural, outdoors sound, with nonprofessional actors, makes their dialog very difficult to follow.  However, it is possible to follow the action in outline.  It's useful to have a look if you're interested in World War II, Italian history, or Italian films.",1363910400,,2825,5.8585365853658535
7899857,3,7535847919,"Having grown up amongst many folks of Italian descent, the term paisan, or pal, was quite familiar to me; especially when used by non-Italians to describe Italian friends of theirs. A similar meaning is conveyed with the use of the term as the title of the second film in Robert Rossellini's War Trilogy. Paisan (Pais), from 1946, is not nearly as well known as Rome Open City, his first trilogy film, but it is a significantly better film, as well as being more truly a Neo-Realist film than its more melodramatic predecessor. Part of the reason is that the 126 minute film is episodic, so that the mawkishness and melodrama, that is inherent in many war stories, never gets to the point of overwhelm. Made and released a year after Rome Open City, Paisan often played on double bills with the earlier film when it was released in  America. The film is set during 1943 and 1944, and each of the six episodes follows the Allies' chronological battles northward through Italy. Each episode highlights willful or mistaken miscommunication between the Allies, the Italians, and the Nazis. The film won many awards, in its day, but curiously languished while other Neo-Realist films became exalted as classics. While not, overall, a great film, three of the episodes reach heights that contain great moments, and these are enough to argue the film passes the near-great threshold, meaning reasonable arguments can be made in its favor. Those episodes are the third, the fourth, and the sixth and final one. The others range from bad to solid. All the episodes open with narration by Giulio Panicali.",1339027200,2,1595,4.885608856088561
