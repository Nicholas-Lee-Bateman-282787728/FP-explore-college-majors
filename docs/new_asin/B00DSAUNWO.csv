5853072,5,B00DSAUNWO,This movie was simply amazing.  Shocking film.  Great for families to watch.  Very powerful and moving.,1412035200,,103,5.3125
5853073,1,B00DSAUNWO,"1st, why is it that everyone who was involved in making this piece of garbage, the only ones that are leaving positive reviews???!!!

Elizabeth Milosca had posted a review stating that the 1st time that she had seen this was in the theaters.  She failed to mention that she and her grand daughter were both part of the cast.  The samething for Croix!  That's ridiculous and to compare this to ""Blair Witch Project"" & ""Paranormal Activity"".

This film is a testimony to horrible acting, horrible story writing, terrible editing, kiddie cinematography, and etc. Everything about this film proves that the filmmakers have no idead what they are doing. The 2 above mentioned films were also made to look professional, had good acting, and actually had a plot.

Who would buy this crap???!!!",1392940800,,786,4.916666666666667
5853074,1,B00DSAUNWO,"I don't get it, is this like a movie? It looks like weird poorly filmed images. I don't even get a sense of a plot. I don't understand why this movie exists. OR why their charging 17.99 for it.

I'm really really confused. I don't understand this movie at all. It's making me slightly upset.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",1377561600,5,335,4.387096774193548
5853075,5,B00DSAUNWO,"A sheriffs department gets hold of footage these girls have shot of themselves. They are way out of control. Very wild, troubled, crazy teen girls. Was at the Beverly Hills film festival. Very intense and moving. Alexis blew me away. Fast moving, NOT for children or young teens. You will be shocked and not be able to look away.",1374537600,2,329,4.593220338983051
5853076,5,B00DSAUNWO,I saw this film at MUVICO theater in Florida.  It was very intense and an eye opener for parents of teenagers.,1373932800,2,110,4.238095238095238

5853091,5,B00DSAUNWO,Good movie.. shows how teenage life is with our generation ... actually thought for a sec it was an actual lost tape being it's based on a true story... worth watching especially if you have teenage girls... I recommend!,1483315200,,220,4.666666666666667
5853092,2,B00DSAUNWO,"There is one major missing item in this ""film;"" content.  The film is long and yet has no content.  Nothing happens in the beginning, then nothing happens in the middle, followed by nothing happening in the end.  Movies with no content must have very strong characterizations.  This one doesn't deliver that either.",1482019200,5,315,5.0

5853096,3,B00DSAUNWO,"Due to the fact I have never heard of this movie and I constantly struggled with my inner intuition to turn it off, I did fast forward a bit though; at the end I actually wondered if it was real and googled it. Kudos.",1480118400,,217,3.9545454545454546

8597114,2,B00DSAUNWO,"no direction. A better movie to watch about this subject is ""Kids"".  Don't waste your time.",1489449600,,91,4.6875
8597115,1,B00DSAUNWO,WOW~ Is This going on with teens to day. What a bunch of fools. LIFE IS TO SHORT. To throw it away like this. WTH is going on with these teens today?,1489104000,,149,3.6875
8597116,3,B00DSAUNWO,there were no actual cats in this movie. it wasn't too bad though,1489104000,,65,4.076923076923077
8597117,3,B00DSAUNWO,"SPOILER ALERT!
This film had the potential to be an updated version of Larry Clark's ""Kids"", but lacked a compelling story.  Kudos to the young actors for making such heavily improvised scenes believable.  It had an authentic found footage feel, but promoting it as publicly released investigation footage is a cheap move that just makes the viewer suspicious.  That ploy hasn't worked since Blair Witch.  Nevertheless, it was fascinating to watch and I found myself repeatedly questioning my certainty that it was all staged.
Cut about 15-20 minutes, lose the ""Police File"" B.S., and change the ending so that the suicide girl is already dead when they break into the bathroom, then cut to the credits on an image of her dead body on the bathroom floor.
It could have been great!",1487116800,2,780,4.886363636363637
8597118,2,B00DSAUNWO,didn't care for it,1486166400,,18,3.75
8597119,3,B00DSAUNWO,"This movie depicts what real teens are doing without guardians. I liked it, I mean it was real and raw. A lot of films don't show the real life party types. The one weird girl needs to be arrested for forcing a tween to do drugs. How those girls treated their mothers was horrible.",1485129600,2,281,4.222222222222222
