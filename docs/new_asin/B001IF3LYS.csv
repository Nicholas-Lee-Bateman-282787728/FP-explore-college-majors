3648012,5,B001IF3LYS,"I am also an adult who went to see the midnight viewing of the movie.  I'm addicted, what can I say.  I thought that the movie was incredible and the music is maturing as the stars become older. You will get goosebumps when you hear how they end it with a slow mature edition of ""We're All In This Together"", and ""High School Musical"".  Though I'm excited about the HSM4 it will never be the same!",1224806400,,397,4.197368421052632
3648013,5,B001IF3LYS,"I am not ashamed to say that I am an adult who LOVES High School Musical. I went to see the midnight show with my younger sister and 2 of her friends and it was well worth being sluggish at work this morning. The songs don't have quite the same sing along quality as those in the first 2 movies, but they're still enjoyable. The story feels more fleshed out this time around. My favorite scene in the movie featured Troy and Chad dancing in a junkyard singing the 'Boys are Back'. I liked the newbie Rocket Man. He's no Zach Efron, but he might be worth watching in HSM 4.",1224806400,18,572,4.162162162162162

3648016,5,B001IF3LYS,"You can't argue that Zac Efron's performance in this movie WASN'T the best acting of the mid-late 2000's. You just can't- not after Troy's iconic breakdown scene (shoutout Ms. Darbus). Although I do wish Gabriella didn't play with his soft, flippy-haired soul as much as she did.

And let me just play devil's advocate and note here that Sharpay did NOT deserve as much hate as she got. Yes, a drama queen in full, however she JUST wanted Troy to have a stable future (Gabriella didn't even care about anything but her own)!",1518998400,,524,4.634408602150538

3648109,1,B001IF3LYS,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

3648166,5,B001IF3LYS,"This movie still holds a very important spot in my heart and since yesterday was the 10 year anniversary I wanted to watch all the movies back too back. This movie is always the saddest of them because of all the nods in the movie that this was the last one and the final number ""High School Musical"" is always emotional for me.

I was 11-12 when the first movie came out and after that I was hooked I watched every movie or show the main cast was in and was suck into my first fandom. I've been following Vanessa's career since this first movie and it's been emotional rewatching this remembering where I was when each movie came out and the nostalgia feeling attached to these movies.

These movies are so much about self discovery and learning to be honest and true to yourself no matter what others think. In these movies the theme was always Troy and what his Dad or friends would think. Gabriella being his rock and always being honest with him helps him grow into the person he became in the final movie. I always found this last one really emotional and honest because it's about what happens after High School and Gabriella going to a college that would be far away from Troy. High School couples go through that all the time and it shows the real struggle he faces without having her right with him whenever. Also, shows that Troy after all the years of loving basketball and now music he has no clue what he wants to do with his life after high school.

This one felt the most real in terms of the issues and I'm glad to say I was there from the beginning. Once a Wildcat always a Wildcat!",1453334400,3,1600,4.326666666666667

Great music, great characters and storyline, fantastic dancing and full of that fantasy/feel-goodness we all love in a good musical.

I've since purchased the HSM 2 and 3 movies and they are fantastic as well, so much so that I've given the entire movie set as gifts to numerous little girls.

3648338,3,B001IF3LYS,"Cute, formulaic, kinda wholesome, and as usual, bad sets, boring songs, good dancing, great supporting characters.

This movie is riddled with inconsistencies. Ryan and Sharpay are rich; they don't need a scholarship, which is a big plot point.  How the heck does Mr. Bolton have a house that fancy on his salary as a High School Basketball coach? How come so few actually eat lunch in that lunch room? Why does the jock Troy give the valedictory speech instead of the brainiacs Taylor, Gabriella, or Martha?

In three movies Hudgens has gotten no better at acting or singing. She always looks as though she's counting how many beats before she says her line. It's hard to watch Efron act with her, or Coleman, because they are so much better that it calls attention to her woodenness.  She is cute, however, and I doubt the ten year olds the movie is made for care about her acting.

Once again the greatness is in the details: the quietly gay Ryan is a work of genius. Not a big deal that he's gay, it's just who he is.  Troy makes sure HIS college choice is close to his girlfriend's, not the other way around. The plus-size girl is not only in the dance finale, but front and center! I LOVE that. (It's still too much to ask to have a cute guy interested in her, but progress all the same.)  While the main plot is a fluffy and silly romance, the film still aces the Bechdel test, as the female characters all have names and interact about something besides who they are going to date.

When my little girl watches this, she knows it is OK to go to Yale and that you don't have to put that off for a guy. She also knows it's OK to try for Juilliard.  (She also thinks it's OK to dance on the lunch table, but you can't have everything.)",1370908800,,1740,4.345679012345679

I won't let him watch it once he gets a bit older and begins to understand the bigger story.

It reminds the older viewer of days of glory and revisits the memories of past joys of the end of childhood, at the threshhold of adulthood. The extended version of HSM 3 gives you interviews and insights into the cast and how close they became over the course of the three movies, and even make you shed a tear at their final scene shooting, taking in all of their tears and hugs.

I actually thought this was the best of the 3 and loved the music and play within a play concept.

3648386,5,B001IF3LYS,"This series' climax in HMS 3 was everything the audience expected -- and hoped for. The movie told the story of growing up, facing the future, making tough choices, and sticking to your dreams. Pretty deep stuff for a ""teen"" movie musical. The music was irresistable -- like any good musical. The choreography was something special. (How often do you actually enjoy watching men, of any age, prance around, trying to dance?) But this time the choreography seemed to really fit the characters -- Troy Bolton and Chad Danforth -- both very ""manly"" characters. But instead of looking foolish, prancing around, they really seemed to be using the choreography as an extension of their dialogue.

And, I have to admit that, as a parent, I was wholly impressed by the fact that the writers didn't stoop to the ever-present use (and over use) of sex to make their story interesting. In the end, this was a story about the best in our nation's young people. Just a little bit idealistic, but isn't that what we watch movies for??",1282176000,,1020,4.730337078651686

3648398,1,B001IF3LYS,"I really enjoyed and appreciated the first High School Musical.  It had a vital message for young people, not highly original, but possibly stated in such a way that it would reach a few individuals that wouldn't necessarily pay attention to anything else.  Right now, there is a student who is breaking the mold and surpassing their expectations because they learned that they could from the Disney Channel! The sequel left most of that out, and the third installment looks more like something a Government agency would come up with.  The original cast have become caricatures of themselves and so many elements of the storyline have been reworked from the first two movies that it eventually becomes a chore just to sit through it. This film fulfilled all of my expectations, but not in a good way.  I was sincerely hoping that they would have poured a little bit of that high budget movie money into the script, but it was my perception that nobody even went back to watch the original film.  Sure, the first movie was posturing and silly, but in the end it meant something. This film just means that there is no concept so insignificant that a movie studio can't throw money at it in the hopes of making more.  Lesson Learned.",1246406400,6,1230,4.671296296296297
3648399,4,B001IF3LYS,"This movie is about Troy who struggles with the dilemma of whether to play basketball or sing all while trying to keep his girlfriend. Pretty much, it's the same thing as High School Musical 1.

I won't knock the movie for having a trivial story because high school kids care about trivial things. My biggest problem is, none of the characters seem to have grown at all since the first movie. Troy still doesn't know what he wants to do, Sharpay is still a back stabbing creep, and Gabriella is still the airhead girlfriend she was in the first film. The only difference here is, this is senior year and they leave each other in the end.

The musical numbers are all very well done. The main star of the movie is the choreographer who has to handle all the 30 year old dancers pretending to be 18 year olds. The songs are pretty good but they're not really all that memorable. I doubt kids that watch this today will be singing these songs when they're adults. This is not Grease. But it is good clean fun and it's nice to see young people interested in musicals.

I wish the songs weren't so incredibly over produced. Every time they start singing, it doesn't sound like they're in the real world anymore. It sounds like they're in a studio. Especially Vanessa Hudgens who sounds like her voice had to be worked over in a computer. But it still sounds whiny and nasal. Contrast this movie with Hairspray. In that movie the musical numbers just seemed to fit and blend in with the story and not seem like music videos.

However, the movie was still very enjoyable and I would recommend it for young people. Better they see movies about kids going off to college than movies about drugs and sex.",1246060800,3,1694,4.472491909385114

3648443,3,B001IF3LYS,"Don't work, High School Musical 3 isn't the end of the story. High School Musical 4 (a West Side Story-type plot) returns to TV with a mostly new cast. But HSM3 is the finale for our current classmates. It was a marked improvement over HSM2, which somehow was a tad too calculated to recapture the innocent fizziness of the undemanding original. None of them are great art, not even close. But HSM3 has some good touches, including a gracious finale that echoes high school productions by letting the cast take a bow. And I definitely appreciated that they stayed true to the quietly gay Ryan (played charmingly by Lucas Grabeel, who was also good in a small role in Milk). His sexuality is never mentioned as such, but his message of being different but accepted comes through. But which format do you accept for watching the film at home? It comes in virtually every possible combination. You can get the basic theatrical version for $29.99. You can get the extended edition for $34.99. But the smartest buy of all is the BluRay High School Musical 3: Senior Year Deluxe Extended Edition for $39.99. Yes, studios better wise up and make Bluray the same price as regular DVDs. But on sale at Amazon, it's only $3 more than the Deluxe regular DVD. And you get the BluRay version, plus a second standard DVD in case the kids have a regular DVD player in their room or for road trips PLUS you get a free digital copy so you can watch it on a computer or iPhone or other portable device. Not to mention all the usual extras and some unique to BluRay. So no, it's not a special effects extravaganza but the multiple formats for the movie are the way to go. Why make people choose and why make stores carry three or four editions? If this version had been priced at $29.99, it would be the only one they had to provide, instead of three different editions cluttering up the shelves.

3648445,4,B001IF3LYS,"High School Musical 3 is the third movie in the High School Musical series but the first to be released as a feature length film in theatres.  The story is straightforward and not reliant on having seen the other films.

Troy and Danielle are in their final year of High School.  She is planning to study pre-law at Stanford while he plans to remain in Alberqueque on a basketball scholarship alongside his best friend Chad, this fulfilling his father's dream.  However when the drama teacher files an application in his name for Julliard, it causes him to question what he wants to do in life. At the same time the senior year is gearing up for the Senior Prom and also planning its final High School Musical, which gives the students a chance to demonstrate their considerable talents in the hopes of attaining scholarships to Julliard.

The movie is squeaky clean - Troy and Danielle only exchange chaste kisses and as you'd expect with Disney there is no bad language and or inappropriate sub-plots.  But more than this it is a thoroughly enjoyable film, in large part because of the enthusiasm and energy that Zac Efron brings to the lead role of Troy.  The CD has been on high rotation in my car and is surprisingly endurable.

While it's probably 20 minutes too long and it certainly won't be winning any Oscars, children aged 7-15 will not be able to resist this one.  The appeal is more gender-neutral than I would have thought: I have sons, but the basketball sub-plot and the camaraderie between Troy and Chad sustained their attention.",1243641600,,1547,4.7

I like the broad characterizations and don't mind over-the-top antics in the musical genre.  They seem to fit quite well against a backdrop of spontaneous musical outbursts.

And for those of us who are not preteens, that Zac Efron kid is something else.  I know he's young, but he has the magnetism of someone who is not jailbait.

This third installment clearly has the best production values and is very entertaining. For my money it is the best of the three. The choreography in particular is excellent. The songs are fun and reasonably well performed. I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 because this is a product review and the Blu-ray video is stunning and the sound is excellent. The inclusion of a standard DVD to accompany the Blu-ray is a nice touch for families. Kids can play the regular DVD to death. If the film itself were a timeless classic I would give it a 5. It is still a good film. If you like wholesome, innocent fun with a first-rate presentation, you will enjoy this.",1237852800,,825,4.470198675496689

3648483,5,B001IF3LYS,"This is the first High School Musical ever to go to a movie theater and I wasn't really shocked when I heard that in the summer of 2007 right after the release of High School Musical 2.  I did know before even viewing High School Musical 3 that was probably going to be the last bow for this class in the High School musical series I only say that because I have just recently heard there will be a fourth film, but with almost none of the original class. Right off the bat this film just looks pretty.  Director Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job on making this look like a musical movie, it just looks very pleasing to the eye.  The story really surrounds the theme of moving on and the fact that things change once one leaves high school, friends depart, and most heartbreaking some love relationship die.  For Troy and Gabriella High School Musical's Tony and Maria from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Side-Story-Blu-ray/dp/B00172R37I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Side Story [Blu-ray</a>] that reality is coming to ahead.  This is more difficult for Troy just because he really doesn't know who he is. A theme that we have seen before in the first two films but he has never really dealt with it before.  Like it or not, Troy's story is relatable in the idea that most if not all kids don't know who they are or what career path they should choose and the world isn't going to stop turning just so you can decide.  Zac Efron did an amazing job in terms of balancing the emotional scenes, with the romantic scenes, with the comedic scenes.  He and Vannessa Hudgens gave their characters closure which I think every fan wanted to see.  There is more music and dance numbers in this movie than the other two films combined and it is probably in my opinion the best of the series.  Now, if you were not a fan of the first two films do not buy this movie, but if you were you will not be dissapointed.",1237593600,,1950,4.675438596491228

I used to have a season pass for the entire family to Disneyland for the past three years and within the California Theme Park, they did have a parade for the HSM 2.  My son loved it so much which we decided to get the Blu Ray version of the part 2.  Fast forward two years later, HSM3 did not dissapoint at all.  In fact, it raises the bar.  It has more musical performance and the message of being a senior in high school does send a very good message and it brings back memories.  It is a definite buy for me and it is worth every penny.  I just ordered thru Amazon the Blu Ray edition of the first HSM Remix in which I have not seen at all.  With this, my collection of all HSM movies will be complete.",1235952000,,846,3.929411764705882

I think Highschool Musical 3 is a really well made film with great music, some good acting, and it's just a good time for the whole family. Some of the actors in the film aren't that great, they're way too cheesy for me to find them believable, but Ashley Tisdale is actually pretty decent at being the snobby diva and Zach Efron is actually a good stage performer. Other than that, most of the cast is slightly forgettable. Good movie and good musical. I have a weak spot for musicals and disney, so this one gets the better side of me. ps it looks great on blu ray, I'm glad this is how I saw it for the first time, however, i think ima skip out on 1 and 2...I've never seen them but...they must be alot cheesier than the 3rd one.

Anyone with half a brain can see that Disney has shamefully resurrected the clich&eacute;d teenage musical films of the 70's that make real people sick to their stomaches.  At nearly two hours this vomit-inducing garabage heap will only appeal to nave, preppy tweens with nothing better to do than sponge off their parents money or gullable soccer moms, who instead of sitting around with their Hannah Montana clones all day, should be looking for a job.

With the innovating title ""High School Musical"" we follow the same politically correct ensamble of so-called actors from the first two installments into their senior year of high school.  This cast of perfect little dittoheads then sing and dance their way through all the lame problems of their senior year and graduate.

Are you sure somebody didn't fart?  'Cuz this reeks BAD!",1235606400,4,860,5.02112676056338
3648508,4,B001IF3LYS,"How different is High School Musical 3 from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes?

Not much when you think about it. They all depict what has been referred in the past as Disney's ""idealization of life."" The High School Musical films let you live for a while in a school without the harshness of real-life student politics, teacher issues and especially the dark, cynical vision so often seen on television, films and books inexplicably accepted as ""kid-friendly.""

Therein lies its charm. Whatever your opinion of the High School Musical series, you can't help but marvel at how young people have taken to it -- despite its omission of language, sex and bitterness that some in the industry insist are requirements to ""get the kids."" If only prime time TV would get the message perhaps it would not be at an all time low in viewership.

Since this, the third film, was given a more generous budget, much of the money shows up on the screen, especially in the lavish production numbers like ""I Want it All,"" and particularly ""Scream,' in which director Kenny Ortega pays tribute to Fred Astaire by flipping over the school hallway (and Zac Efron). The cast are as charming as ever. I was particularly happy to see the character of Mrs. Darbus (Alyson Reed) get a brief but nice opportunity to explore more warmth and depth than afforded in the previous chapters.

And since this is the farewell film for the main ""students"" (though some of the others may emerge from the background in the 4th film planned for TV), there are at least three finales. These kids sing their goodbyes a lot before a curtain literally falls over the whole thing, never to be quite the same again until, perhaps, the High School Musical reunion movie we can certainly look forward to in about 8 to 10 years (wonder who'll be ""available"" to reprise their roles?)

In the tradition of frothy musical fun, the story is secondary to watching the characters cavort. Sharpay, who despite learning her lesson in each film and ""turning nice,"" goes back to square one repeatedly -- like Wile E. Coyote. This time, she gets a British assistant to facilitate villainous monologuing because her brother is leaning on the ""nice kids"" side this time.

The whole thing is a lot of fun. My daughter and her friends are starting to get too cool for HSM but still enjoy this movie, much as they're not into Miley so much but they like her sitcom just fine (Monkee career warning, Miley.)

The DVD offers bloopers and short documentaries about the production and the farewell nature of the project, plus an extra reprise of ""Right Here, Right Now"" not seen in the theatrical version. A 2-disc edition also includes a digital download.

Though it's always debatable whether any group of ambitious young performers in a film or TV series are as chummy as they are publicized to be, I can't help but believe their mixed feelings about leaving HSM behind. It's what they knew, it's what ""made"" them, and the future is exciting but pretty scary.

3648513,5,B001IF3LYS,"An enjoyable, fun film courtesy of a bigger budget, better production, stage and lighting, this is the best ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL"" film of the three.  The transfer on to Blu-ray is excellent in picture and audio quality and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment really went all out with this ""Deluxe Extended Edition"" release.

With the previous two films debuting on the Disney Channel, ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"" was the first of the three films to go on the big screen and eventually having the largest opening weekend for a musical film ever earning $42 million in North America and $40 million overseas in its first three days of release.  Opening at #1 and also having solid sales with its musical soundtrack.

One can say it's the typical teenage angst that we saw from the first previous two films but what makes ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"" so much better is the higher production values.  The film features one of the most ambitious sets, choreography, costume and stage designs, lighting and uses of color in a musical.

And because the higher production values, it definitely heightens the enjoyability of the film.  From performances in the basketball court, outdoors at a college campus, a junkyard and more, the cinematography is really solid.

And of course, everything translates well on Blu-ray.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and the picture quality is excellent.  In one musical segment titled ""I Want it All"" featuring Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans, I was just amazed by the sudden shifts of color and how amazing it looked.  The colors were just vibrant and after watching the film on Blu-ray, I had to see how different the experience of watching it on Blu-ray versus DVD.  The Blu-ray colors just were amazing and on DVD, it was good but not in the same vibrancy as the Blu-ray.  This segment just was a great example of good colorful choices on costume design and set design and there are many instances that really stick out in the film. Even in the non-musical segments, the outdoor and indoor segments were colorful and looked great on Blu-ray.

As for the audio, the audio quality is of course music-driven and music really comes alive with the English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  I did notice a few instances of rear channels being used during scenes with a lot of people but in most part, the film is dialogue and music driven and overall audio quality is also great.

So, picture and audio quality for ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"" is fantastic!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

And this is probably where Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment really went all out in this DELUXE EXTENDED EDITION release.  You get a total of three discs, the first being the Blu-ray which is the extended version of the movie, the second being the Digital Copy and the third being the DVD copy of the extended edition movie.  Having not watched the normal theatrical version, I do know that the original had 112 minutes and this extended version is 117 minutes long.

As for special features, this is where the Blu-ray shines.  Included are:

  * Senior Awards - The crew felt that with the talent graduating from ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL"", a yearbook was created with photos from present but also the cast having the ability to vote for ""Best Dressed"", ""Best Comedian"", ""Best Couple"", etc.
  * New Cast Profiles - This segment features the passing of the torch to the new characters: Matt Prokop (Jimmie Zara), Justin Martin (Donny Dion) and Jemma McKenzie-Brown (Tiara Gold).  With clips from their video reports, from beginning when they first started and eventually making friends with the original cast and interviews about the three becoming part of the popular trilogy.
  * Disney Live Network - The ability to include your photos into the ""EAST HIGH SCHOOL"" yearbook ala BD-Live and more.
  * Cast Goodbyes - Interviews with the cast and Director Kenny Ortega and everyone saying goodbye and being emotional during the final shot and much more.  The cast reflecting on their last chance to be with each other as a group.
  * Deleted Scenes - About eight deleted scenes with an introduction by Director Kenny Ortega who mentioned it was done because of pacing and how difficult it was to cut some of these parts.
  * Bloopers - These are not the same bloopers shown at the end credits, these are totally different.
  * Sing Along with the Movie - By enabling the sing along subtitles, you can watch certain songs and sing to them.
  * Night of Nights - A featurette on the prom and having to prepare for the number and learn the choreography.
  * It's All in the Dress - Creating the dream prom and the ideas on the prom dresses for the actresses.
  * Table of Contents - Similar to a year book, this section features photos and you can skip pages but also access certain special features and Easter Eggs.  You can go to previous or next page via remote, if you press up on each page with your remote and select on the photos for each page, you either can access a special feature (that is also listed on the special feature section) or get a East High Wildcats claw. These claws are hidden short video segments featuring behind-the-scenes footage not featured in the special features section. The hidden claws can be found on the following pages and you can access the following Easter Eggs:Page 2 - Crazy improv segment
  Page 3- Tiara vs. Sharpay segment
  Page 4 - Choreography segment
  Page 5 - Basketball rig triggering
  Page 6 - Basketball dance choreography
  Page 8 - Two Easter Eggs (prom advice from the cast and Ashley Tisdale and Chris Warren choreography)
  Page 12 - Two Easter Eggs (graduation dancing scenes)

JUDGMENT CALL:

Overall, I was quite impressed with this Blu-ray disc releae of ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"".  On the extended version of the film, I was quite amazed by the production values from the stage, set and costume design, the cinematography, the lighting and the Blu-ray disc transfer of the film and seeing how beautiful and colorful the picture quality was and how clear and live the music sounds, fans of the film and have a Blu-ray player are truly in for a treat.

And to celebrate the ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"", Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment included the extended version on DVD and a digital copy disc as well.

And the number of special features and Easter Eggs were also another positive of the Deluxe Extended Edition.

If you enjoyed the previous two ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL"" films, one thing you felt when watching those films are ""Disney"" musicals.  Something you expected to see on the Disney Channel.  With ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR"", because of the high production value, the film really looked extremely well and after watching the special features, you learn that the cast really had to go all out in learning the choreography and with this film being the cast's final film together, they went all out.

Now, how did I feel about the music in this film?  I think with every ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL"" that I've watched, there were always numbers that I enjoyed and numbers that tend to stick in your mind.  But I have to say that this third film, the music was quite solid.  Also, I think that the cast felt more at ease and were much more comfortable with their surroundings and were not as stiff in the choreography.  The songs were sung well, the choreography was great!

But thanks to the higher budget and better production quality, I believe that director Kenny Ortega had much more freedom and again, with this being the final film for the main cast, everyone gave their best and it showed!

A fantastic Blu-ray release and a must-own for ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL"" fans!",1235001600,9,7814,4.74536005939124
3648514,4,B001IF3LYS,"It's spring, and the Wildcats are facing the last few weeks of their high school career.  Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu) are leading East High's basketball team in another championship game.  But their final minutes of playing basketball are only the first of the many finals they will face.

And as our characters face saying goodbye, they have to start dealing with the future.  Troy and Chad have been accepted at the local university to play ball.  But Troy isn't sure he wants to.  His girlfriend Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) is going to Stanford.  In fact, she is considering their early admission program, which would mean she would have to leave early.

But it's a chance to do one last show together that truly brings everyone together.  While they prepare a show about their hopes for the future and the pain of saying goodbye, the group finds out that scouts from Julliard are going to be there to consider composer Kelsi (Olesya Rulin), choreographer Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel), star Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale), or Troy for one spot and a scholarship.  Who will get it?  Does Troy want it?  And how will he and Gabriella ever say goodbye?

Now if you are looking for a realistic movie, turn back now.  This is a G rated Disney musical, for pete's sake.  But it is still fun.

This movie focused a bit too much on the songs.  The plot was a little too loose and predictable, making it just an excuse to string some songs together.  The good news is, those songs are fun, with several hummable, toe tapping numbers.  And the choreography was amazing.  Several of the songs involved multiple locations and costume changes.  This is a big screen musical for movie musical lovers.  I especially loved the number in the junkyard.

Frankly, I wish this movie were about 20 minutes longer.  They could have used the time to give us more with the supporting players.  Heck, cutting out one of Troy and Gabriella's three love duets would have allowed for that, too.  I really have loved the entire cast of these things.

Speaking of casts, three sophomores are introduced here to lead the next installment in the franchise.  Honestly, I didn't care for any of them.  Hopefully, when they become leads they will be better developed as characters.

While the entire series has had a helping of cheese, this one did feel a bit more over the top when it came to the graduation scene.  Surely, they could have found some other way to handle that one.

But if all this sounds like I didn't like the movie, think again.  I found it somewhere between the first and second in the series.  I was smiling the entire time.  There are a couple in jokes, so do watch these movies in order to catch them.

This was designed to be the last we'll see of the original cast (until the inevitable High School Reunion Musical in 10 years).  Honestly, that makes me sad.  This send off will certainly please the franchises many fans.",1235001600,,2941,4.63883495145631
3648515,5,B001IF3LYS,"I thought HSM 3 was an awesome movie. The acting and songs were amazing. I am just sad to see an excellent triology come to an end.

In high school musical 3 you get to see all of the emotions and changes that happen during senior year. You get to see Troy and Gabriella's relationship progress, you get to see what everyone's future is going to be, you get to see prom (Troy and Gabriella look amazing and so does the rest of the class), you get to see everyone graduate, and you get to see everyone say goodbye to each other which was really sad. There are some really hard decisions to be made in this movie and I think everyone did an excellent job acting it out.

Overall this movie was great. It was played out really well. When you are watching this movie you really feel like you are also saying goodbye to the cast and its really sad.

I wish the entire cast good luck with everything they do in the future.

If you love the first two high school musical films then I know you'll love this one as well.

The Extended version of the film comes with an extended version of the film, sing alongs, cast interviews, bloopers and so much more.

3648525,3,B001IF3LYS,"I enjoyed HSM 1 & 2. But I was disappointed with this one. It was more of the same (which is becoming a theme at Disney.) In this ""final"" movie the guys are dealing with graduation and where they will end up at college and what they will end up majoring in. Once again, there is the normal drama that threatens to separate Troy and Gabriella... but luckily there is a musical coming up at the end of the year that brings them back together again. What luck!

I know that this is a musical but does it have to have the same plot three times in a row? Couldn't the writers focused on the other characters? Why would Gabriella fall into the same pattern again? I started to become disconnected due to the lack of growth in the characters.

My children enjoyed it (and would be angry if they knew I was giving it this low a rating!) I enjoyed it for what it was: more of the same.

3648541,5,B001IF3LYS,"Honestly, High School Music fan or not, this movie is truly amazing. Of course, anyone who liked the first two will probably fall in love with this one, as it is, hands down, the best in the trilogy.  I think that even if you didn't see the first two or if you weren't particularity fond of them, you will like this one regardless because of what it deals with.  This movie is about something we all go through as senior in high school - saying good-bye to our friends after high school.  Addiotionally, it's nice to see a teen movie that doesn't revolve around sex, drugs, violence, and profanity. (I am aware many of you will argue with me that this is not exactly a film aimed at a teenage or young adult audience and that the viewing public expected for it is in fact little elementary school children simply because it is G-rated Disney movie, but to me, that makes no sense whatsoever. The movie talks about high school graduation, college applications, prom, the Ivy League universities, etc. Do you really think a 10-year-old will understand that?)

The East High Wildcats decide to put on their final show together at their school: a musical about their twelfth grade experience.  It'll be a pretty unique musical because, for once, they won't have to play a character - they'll be playing themselves!  But due to her incredible intelligence, Gabriella, the female protagonist, is offered to skip her senior year in high school and go to straight onto college right away.  Will she accept Standard's offer, leaving her friends, boyfriend, and the musical behind?  Will Troy, the male protagonist, chose to continue with basketball or will he chose a career than involves acting? Will Sharpay win a scholarship to New York's Julliard University of Performing Arts or will her brother?  Will Ryan and Kelsi find true love?  Find out in this exciting conclusion to one of the world's greatest film series!  The only good thing recently produced by the screwed-up Disney Channel!  Yes I hate Disney Channel, Hannah Montana, Cory in the House, Jonas Brothers, and all of the other inappropriate teen shows they've decided to put on a children's channel.  But High School Musical is different.  It teaches both kids and teens a valuable lesson and it allows adults to revisit their past.  The plot is actually relevant to what many people feel and...it's a teenage musical!  You don't see something like that everyday!  Just watching Troy and Gabriella perform a beautiful waltz is reason enough to buy this film.  Also, the old fashioned music at the end proves that rap, hip hop, and pop isn't always what you'll see in a teenage film.

The songs are as original, catchy, and wonderful as they are visually stunning! During ""Scream,"" the turning walls that represent Troy's confusion are spectacular!  The disappearing pictures on the wall in Gabriella's solo ""Walk Away"" were really quite sad.  The Statue of Liberty that shoots fireworks out of its head in ""I Want It All"" is amazing.  The sets in ""A Night To Remember"" will leave you with your mouth wide open.  ""Right Here Right Now,"" ""Can I Have This Dance,"" and ""Just Wanna Be With You"" are three incredible romance songs.  And, of course, Troy and Chad turning into little boys in ""The Boys Are Back"" was really cute.  That reminds, ""Right Here Right Now"" and ""The Boys Are Back"" are so of my favorites because of what they talk about: not wanting to grow up.  Anyway, n case you forgot or are too lazy to read the customer reviews for the HSM3 soundtrack, here are the songs:

1. ""Now Or Never"" - Troy and the Wildcats basketball team

2. ""Right Here, Right Now"" - Troy and Gabriella

3. ""I Want It All"" - Sharpay and Ryan [A TRUE BROADWAY SONG!]

4. ""Can I Have This Dance? (Version I)"" - Troy and Gabriella

5. ""A Night To Remember"" - cast!

6. ""Just Wanna Be With You"" - Ryan & Kelsi, Troy & Gabriella

7. ""The Boys Are Back"" - Troy and Chad

8. ""Walk Away"" - Gasbriella

9. ""Scream"" - Troy

10. ""Can I Have This Dance? (Version II)"" - Troy and Gabriella

11. ""Senior Year Spring Musical"" ***made up of reprises of NOW OR NEVER (Chad, the Wildcats basket team, cheerleaders), I WANT IT ALL (Ryan),  JUST WANNA BE WITH YOU (Sharpay & Jimmy, and later Troy and Gabriella), and A Night To Remember (Sharpay vs. Tiara), as well as a new song: Last Chance (Ryan and Kelsi)***

12. ""We're All In This Together"" - cast!

13. ""High School Musical"" - cast!

14. ""Just Getting Started"" - during the end credits, winner of the Get In The Picture ABC7 contest

By the way, during the ""I Want It All,"" you actually see Gabriella The Maid a bit more than you did in the theaters because you see that part of the song in a different camera angle than you did in theaters.  That also lets you see an important-looking lady giving Ryan a newspaper with him and Sharpay on the cover.  This is not due to the extended edition thing because the song is the same length, but, like I said, the camera angle is different so you see more things.

The special features on this Blu-ray are freakin' cool!  Even though it's a single disc release, it has the exact same content found on the Two-Disc release, plus more! These are the Special Features (the last two aren't found on the two-disc release).

-- Extended Version Of The Movie
-- Optional Sing Along Version
-- Bloopers
-- Deleted Scenes
-- ""Cast Goodbyes"" feature
-- ""Night Of Nights"" feature
-- ""It's All In The Dress"" feature
-- ""Senior Awards"" feature
-- New Cast Profiles

In addition, just like in the Two-Disc release, you can download a digital copy of the movie.  And as if that weren't enough, it comes with the first disc of the Two-Disc Edition!!!!! Now you can watch the movie practically anywhere because you have the regular version as well as the Blu-ray version!!!! What do you know, it is a two disc after all.  ^_^",1230595200,24,5832,4.59284332688588

3648543,5,B001IF3LYS,"Although the first HSM movie will always be the best because it was the first and started this whole phenomenon, HSM3 will by far be my favorite.  It started out as a low budget tv-movie all the way up to box office hit!  It had a modest budget of $11 million and made at least 8 or 9 times that amount.

It's fun to watch these movies because that is what it's meant for.  It's not meant to be really deep or profound--just fun!  You have to expect that from a G-rated Disney film.  That's what makes it great!

HSM3 has the best set designs, dance numbers, and coming of age drama that anyone can understand.  I high recommend this!",1229731200,4,634,4.225

I got hooked on High School Musical when I saw the very first commercial for the HSM1.  1 and 2 are just awesome, however, even though I think that HSM3 was great I think that there was a little too much music and not enough story.  I really expected more scheming from Sharpay and more story.  I think there should be one more HSM.  High School Musical 4 The Reunion.  It could show us what Troy chose to do for a profession(after college).  I mean is he in theater or he a pro basketball player.  I also think that it would be a great way to have Troy propose to Gabriella.  The wedding could be one of the musicals.",1228435200,,663,4.1171875
3648545,5,B001IF3LYS,"I'm with the other reviewer, who didn't have high hopes for part 3 after the wretched excuse for a sequel Disney handed us in Part 2: The Country Club.  Oh, what a disappointing picture.  But this one catches at and grabs exactly the qualities the first one had that made it so great, and while it doesn't take us by surprise the way Part One did, it has something bigger that really works for it here, it has a bigger budget and you can see it on the screen this time.  I wonder how it will play on home video, but on the huge theater screen it was awesome.  In fact even on the big screen the energy and the action seemed like it was going to blow the screen into pieces--that's how feisty this one is.  It's like HSM on nitro; it's all glowing and fizzy like electric Kool Aid.

Okay, the plot isn't much but it's better than the insult of Part Two.  It's not going to be about whether the Wildcats become champs or not, for that suspense is taken care of in the musical's opening number.  It's mostly about Troy Bolton trying to decide whether or not he deserves his own dream.  This philosophical question is examined under a microscope through a barrage of ethical interventions: by the end I was wondering what sort of person DOESN'T deserve his own dream, so the plot's climax was rather an anticlimax.  Was Xac up to the challenge?  I think so.  That song ""Scream"" had his climbing the walls and rolling around the floors and ceilings like Fred Astaire in Stanley Donen's ROYAL WEDDING--but picture an upset, frantic Fred Astaire, perhaps the Astaire from ON THE BEACH.  Anyhow he's very good, though too pumped up, or were those scary muscles Photoshopped in, for sometimes they disappeared and he was just a boy again and not the Terminator.

But who cares about the plot, for really all it was is a throughline on which to hang a series of remarkable, even heroic musical numbers.  Warning, song number two (in the treehouse) is pretty bad -- almost Part Two bad -- but nothing else afterwards even comes close to that nadir.  And even that number is saved (or nearly so) by one of Kenny Ortega's brilliant storytelling ideas, when Zac pulls a cord and the treehouse roof lifts up to reveal the beautiful night sky gleaming with starlight.

After that, it's sort of an unbroken series of showstoppers, and even Ryan and Sharpay get a good one for a change: ""I Want It All"" outdoes Busby Berkeley in its continuous invention, with Troy playing an adoring Sharpay fan, Gabriella sexy in a French maid's outfit, the Russian girl playing a NY cab driver, etc.  ""Can I Have This Dance,"" ther waltz number, is adorable, though one worries about Gabriella dancing backwards in those big high heels.  The big love duet, ""Just Wanna Be with You,"" is not as good as ""Breaking Free"" from Part One, but even Mozart's THE MAGIC FLUTE is not as good as ""Breaking Free"" from Part One, so cut it some slack.

In ""A Night to Remember,"" the girls fantasize about prom night, while the boys complain about fitting into tuxes, it's all in good fun, and it will not quit, just gets bigger and bigger; other kids play the leads' parents in cute scenes involving the boys picking up the girls from identical clapboard houses, it's magic.  The junkyard duet isn't as good as it wants to be, but again Ortega works magic, first by substituting 8 year old look alikes for Corbin and Zac, then having the boys dance (or whatever you call it) on giant big rubber tires across the screen, it can't be real, and yet it looks real, doesn't it?

I wonder if the producers were annoyed with Monique Coleman because she certainly doesn't have a thing to do here.  Can she even sing or dance?  Maybe not.  As for Ryan, I have heard that in real life he is straight.  Well, maybe so.

The one I hate the most though, is Stanford.  Yes, Stanford University.  What kind of cruel college accepts 30 deserving high school seniors to a special honors program that forces them to miss their prom, their spring musical, AND their own graduation?  What kind of precedent is that to set, Stanford?  What comes next, enrolling the smart ones right out of junior high and forcing them to miss the magic of high school entirely?  Let me tell you, I felt for Gabriella Montez in this one, and I always will.  UNFAIR STANFORD!  JOY KILLING STANFORD!",1225584000,2,4311,4.505791505791506
3648546,3,B001IF3LYS,"""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" is the only film in the series to have been theatrically released. I honestly don't know whether or not this was a good idea. While a big screen and an even bigger budget gave director/co-choreographer Kenny Ortega licenses he didn't have with the first two Disney Channel films, they still didn't allow the story to become anything other than a teen dance extravaganza with a bubblegum pop soundtrack. Then again, it's silly to assume that it actually wanted to be something more; ""Senior Year"" remains true to everything that made the first two films such a success, and it does so with no apologies to the people it was obviously not made for, like me. It may be airy, simplistic, innocent, and hopelessly nave, but it's also harmless, so I see no reason why the fan base shouldn't be allowed to just go and have a good time.

""Senior Year"" essentially follows the same squeaky-clean plot of the first two films, focusing on the twelfth-grade students of East High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) is still the captain of his Basketball team, the Wildcats, and just like before, he finds himself torn between the game and musical theater. His girlfriend is still Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens), the math genius who also loves to sing and dance. Their relationship will once again be tested, especially since they have two different colleges in mind. His best friend, Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu), is still the jock he always was, and he plans on going to the same college as Troy on a Basketball scholarship. The rich, spoiled drama queen Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) is still scheming her schemes, devising ways to eliminate the competition from this year's musical production. She still has her brother, Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), on a very short leash. I don't know why writer Peter Barsocchini wanted these characters to be related; I find the idea of a brother and sister being so close is a little creepy.

I suppose I should criticize this movie for telling the exact same story over again. On the other hand, audiences tolerated the Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland backyard musicals, the plots of which are summed up with the immortal line, ""Let's rent the old barn and put on a show!"" These words, incidentally, are surprisingly apt for any ""High School Musical"" film; a barn has never been involved, but a theater stage certainly has. So has a Basketball court, which, when you stop and think about it, is pretty much the same thing as a stage. Whether they're shooting hoops or singing songs, it's all about performing with these students.

The inflated budget for the third movie is most evident during three musical numbers. The first one shows Sharpay and Ryan fantasizing about being Broadway superstars, and it features glitzy sets, colorful costumes, dramatic lighting, and a multitude of dancers. The second one shows Troy and Chad in an automobile junkyard. As soon as they begin dancing, mechanics come out of the woodwork and join in. That scene also features a stripped car with a hood that opens and closes in time with the song. The third one shows a confused, frustrated Troy wandering the school halls after hours. One key shot tips its hat to ""Royal Wedding,"" specifically the scene in which Fred Astaire dances across the floor, walls, and ceiling of a furnished room (achieved by a rotating set). They're displays of theatrical opulence, all of which were noticeably absent from the previous ""High School Musical"" films. It even spills into the school's new musical production, which looks and sounds more expensive than most high schools--or even colleges--can probably afford.

The problems stem from the fact that lavish song and dance numbers don't go hand in hand with songs so adolescent, so contrived, so musically derivative that they all seem to come off of an assembly line. Do kids really enjoy music like that? My personal tastes in musicals were formed at age three, when I first saw Frank Oz's remake of ""Little Shop of Horrors."" That film introduced me to Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, the talented songwriting duo who would later rejuvenate Walt Disney Pictures with wonderful contributions to ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin."" They understood that even films geared towards younger audiences deserved stirring, memorable musical numbers. This is more than I can say for the ""High School Musical"" films, all of which feature bland, lifeless songs written by anonymous people.

But wait a minute--I seem to be forgetting that artists like Hannah Montana and Hilary Duff and the Jonas Brothers have made it big in the world of bubblegum pop. Movies like ""High School Musical 3"" are perfectly suited for devotees of that particular genre. Can I really blame a film for achieving exactly what it wanted to achieve? Should I look down on a preteen fantasy simply for giving the fans what they asked for? It all inevitably come down to a rating, which in this case has to reflect two things: (1) this movie will satisfy the young adult crowd, especially if they loved the first two ""High School Musicals""; (2) this movie is not meant for older audiences, who will probably not be able to tolerate puppy-love romances, sterile and repetitive plots, stick-figure caricatures, and manufactured music. I'll split the difference with three stars. That should be enough of a guideline for those who could go either way.",1225152000,,5447,4.916304347826087
3648547,5,B001IF3LYS,"It's senior year for the gang at East High and they've got the basketball championship, drama club musicale, and Prom to anguish over.  As if that wasn't enough, Troy's squeeze, Gabriella, is headed for Stanford after graduation and he's slated for a basketball scholarship at U of Albuquerque - or maybe he'll pursue music at Julliard(!).

This edition is even bouncier and more energetic than the previous two HSMs.  While short on dialogue, it's strong on the song-and-dance numbers which are outstanding as usual.  The kids are growing up but still look like ideal, freshly-scrubbed students and the Troy-Gabriella romance has matured and lost its coyness.  Zac Efron (Troy) is every tween's dream and carries the movie just fine.  He can sing and dance and looks great.  Vanessa Hudgens doesn't have much to do besides giggle, but looks good doing it.  The rest of the cast get little individual screen time, but as an ensemble piece, it's wholesome, high-speed fantasy fun.",1225152000,4,979,5.037267080745342
3648548,1,B001IF3LYS,"I'm an adult who saw Grease and Xanadu first run and enjoyed both of them.  I liked HSM 1.  HSM 2 was less enjoyable (too rehash-y) but okay.  This was drivel.

Bad acting.  Rehashment. Pointless plot points.

Things I did like:
1) Darbus was more of a real person than a caricature.
2) Kelsie took off that hat.
3) Great choreo
4) Corbin Bleu can act and sing and dance
5) Tisdale can act
6) Lucas can dance very well
7) In fact, so can Efron - but he still looks like an alien to me.  Ken doll come to life. He landed on earth, and like Ford Prefect decided that Zac Efron was a good name to pick.

Things I didn't like:
1) Gab's annoying giggle . Way overplayed.
2) The photo of the half naked sophomore. That was really a dubious thing to encourage kids to do to each other (and yeah, I know they already do).  And in light of Ms. Hudgen's previous faux pas, a little odd.
3) The sophomores in general.  I realize it was an attempt to set us up for HSM 4, but it was blatant.  The 'rocket' kid actually was funny at the end.

4) The ""Mr Moose ping pong ball"" moment with Troy.
5) Troy's dad's horrible toupee
6) Gab calling Troy wildcat ALL THE TIME. Maverick anybody?
7) Gab's choice near the end of the movie was selfish and thoughtless. Nobody ever called her on that.

8) Kelsie still cannot sing
9) For some reason Taylor and Kelsie REALLY annoy  me with their gestures and facial expressions.
10) And when the pop and lock girl did that stupid gesture/move/catch phrase when Bolton (was he class president or something?) was addressing the graduating class, I was yelling at her inside my head to sit down and stop making a spectacle of herself.

11) The 2 sharpays. Weird and very much single-white-femalish psycho.
Kind of like that battle between bad superman and Clark in Superman III... another disappointing seque",1225152000,2,1829,4.385756676557864
3648549,5,B001IF3LYS,"I am in my 30's and am a total musical fan via Grease etc. I got in to these with my kids and was instantly hooked!! We have waited for months for HSM3 to come out and today we went to see it. From the opening shot at the basketball game to the graduation scene at the end I was thrilled!! The songs are awesome, if a little cheesy (but not every song in Grease was awesome either) and the dances are very well done. My favorites are the Boys are Back in the junkyard with Troy and Chad, and Scream with Troy at the school (the angst of which reminded me of Footloose). The characters have matured and their acting skills are top notch in this film. There were moments where the film drug just a tad but overall it was an awesome movie. I wish they had fleshed out the Zeke/Sharpay relationship in this, he didn't even ask her to prom!! I really wasn't in to any of the new characters tho I know they are a necessity for HSM4 but I could have done with less of them. I will watch HSM4 to see how it fares without Troy and Gabriella, but doubt that it will be an instant classic as this one is. I cannot wait to have it come out on video so I can buy it to watch it over and over (um, with my daughter, yeah thats it) and memorize the songs. This was a definite great movie to see.",1224979200,,1280,3.9844357976653697
