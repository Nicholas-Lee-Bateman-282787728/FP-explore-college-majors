1966486,1,B000127ZAA,"i thought i was going to throw up if this acient was going to keep talking, she never shut up! the workout had potential, but i could never get over her non stop chatter, stop talking and work out! my gosh, Leisa hart nver does this, you would think other teachers would clue in and learn to instruct better, i did not like Petra and think she'll bug more people than just me",1082678400,11,375,4.1506849315068495
1966487,5,B000127ZAA,"Sure, the title is misleading. This workout should be called circuit training  because it's a combination of cardio and weights. Nonetheless, I love this workout! It is fun and effective in a short amount of time. You can make the moves harder by exaggerating your moves and using heavier weights. Even though you use weights, I would still consider this a cardio workout since the weight segments are too short anyway. This workout is suited for beginners/intermediates. As with most exercise videos, there is always a way if you want to add more intensity - MODIFY!",1082246400,39,567,4.90625
1966488,4,B000127ZAA,"I've owned this for a while. I enjoy Petra Kolber & have several of her other exercise DVDs. I like interval training, it revs the metabolism longer than cardio alone. I also find interval training to go faster as it breaks up the cardio segments. I work up a sweat doing this routine but didn't find the moves to be difficult to learn at all.",1341532800,,343,4.292307692307692
1966489,5,B000127ZAA,Petra teaches moves for 3 levels of aerobics so everyone can benefit from this workout. There are several short intervals of strength training providing just enough of a break to catch your breath before starting another set of aerobic moves. The last few minutes provide a nice stretch and cool down period. Petra is not overly chatty and clearly explains all moves.,1299024000,,367,4.935483870967742
1966490,5,B000127ZAA,"Ladies, The advice professional trainers are giving now, is to break up your workout routines. The body is very smart on adapting to exercise workouts, the body is a wonderful, efficient machine. Do you struggle to lift your arms or drive, NO, there is no effort 'cause it is a routine task you do over/over/over. We must, I repeat, we must challenge our bodies out of the routine mode. Unfortunately, as we age, the metabolism slows down, it crawls after 45+ years. Look at most of the female (35+) shapes in the grocery stores & malls. 80% have large waist & flabby arms. I used to walk, spring - fall in my 30's. Of course I had the same old walking routine (easy going pace), sure it kept the pounds off when I was in my 30's, but not my 40's. Waist got bigger and arms got fat & flabby, and I had bra back flab, yuck!
Well, I got introduced to weight training (1x, now 3x week) & using Leslie Sansone DVD's. Over two years I lost 25 pounds and my waist is trim and so are my arms/shoulders/back. I went from size 14 to 8-10. And of course I eat better, food is energy for my body, not a license to pig out. I do admit to chocolate, hey I am still a woman with hormones!  No barbie weights from me.....challenge to increase 10lbs to 15 lbs on each arm for certain exercises. I want my metabolism to burn like a furnace! Now I am looking to cardio interval training to shake up my indoor walking routine. I now understand the concept of 'challenging the body', which is also good for the brain as well.",1223510400,3,1505,4.2439024390243905
1966491,4,B000127ZAA,"Petra Kolber has demonstrated 3 levels of intensity: with her as the least intense and the 2 back ups as medium and hard respectively.
If you are an apartment dweller, this is not recommended because she uses floor space: grapevines, wide strides.
I have a personal issues with  her old fashioned perkiness.  I use her work-out if I want a break from my favorites.

I tend to use the DVD more often for the  bonus John Baptiste 1o minute tune up yoga. Salutations, upward dog, downward dog,  Warrior 1, 2,  forward and reverse triangle.

1966492,1,B000127ZAA,I shut the DVD off after less than 5 min and tossed it in the thrift shop pile.  The coordinated steps were impossible to follow.  I will stick with Leslie Sansone as she is easy for the average person to follow.,1175558400,6,212,4.146341463414634
1966493,4,B000127ZAA,"I had a lot of Petra's VHS  and just love her (Dance Step should be put on DVD, by the way).  She is easy to follow, encouraging and positive, but not annoying.  The program definitely gives you a good workout - and you can vary how intense you want to go.  Although I am not an exercise fanatic (age 38, working mother) I would have liked more weight training. Overall, I like it.",1173139200,5,381,4.178082191780822
1966494,5,B000127ZAA,"I recently had read about how Interval Training was a very effective way to keep your heart healthy, but I didn't own any exercise equipment (you know, the kind you see at the gyms with the interval training option), so I stubbled across this video at the library.  I REALLY like it.  It truly is an interval training workout.  She gets your heart rate up slowly, makes it work hard for a ""power burst"" of one minute and then slows you back down just to repeat it all over again several times.  GREAT concept, and FANTASTIC workout.  A true interval trainer's dream!

HOWEVER, if you are not very coordinated or you aren't naturally inclined to learn workout ""routines"" then you may want to look elsewhere for a good workout.  This video moves fast, so if can't learn steps quickly then you may just get frustrated that you bought it.",1162944000,7,834,4.557046979865772
1966495,5,B000127ZAA,"Exceptionally well-cued, it includes both faster-slower cardio intervals and short toning segments.  This gives you a good chance to catch your breath.  You will burn fat for sure.  You will need 2 to 5 lb. dumbbells for the toning and you'll need lots of energy for the aerobic portions.  I like this kind of routine where you do intervals.  This is what tempted me to buy this and I'm not sorry for doing so.  Petra is a good instructor who knows her stuff and you'll love this I know.",1129939200,10,487,4.415730337078652
1966496,3,B000127ZAA,"I recently rented this video before purchasing.  After doing the workout, I'm glad I didn't spend the $18 to buy it, although it was a nice change to my routine.

To start with the positive, Petra and her two assistants are real looking women.  Not overly made up, and not in super tight spandex.  They look like average women you would see anywhere-which I find refreshing! Petra is chatty, but not overly perky or condescending. During the minute long cardio bursts, Petra and her assistants provide three levels of activity, which is nice for personalizing the workout.

Now for the negative-other than the 3 or 4 cardio bursts, this wasn't much of an aerobic workout, even for a beginner like me! The video begins with little to no warm up (which at this pace, wasn't needed anyhow!). 2-3 minutes into the workout, and poor Petra is literally dripping with sweat (remember, I said she was real looking!), while my heartrate hasn't even gone up yet! The strength routines which follow the cardio bursts, are barely worth doing.  Not enough reps, not enough variety of moves.  Also, if you are a little uncoordinated, like me, some of the dance-y moves during the aerobic and cardio bursts may be a little difficult to keep up with.

This may be a good workout for those days where you aren't feeling very energetic, otherwise, I'd suggest renting this and trying it out for yourself before buying!",1121126400,14,1400,4.756198347107438
1966497,5,B000127ZAA,"Petra Kolber's Cardio Interval Training reinforces my admiration for Petra and her professionalism. What really attracts me to her style is that they are simple, easy but very effective. It gives you an instant fix, as well as a sense of well being which is just fabulous! My arms and legs are now more toned, without ugly bulky muscles. The shape the workout gives you is just really sexy, not over, not under - healthy, but still feminine of course that is, if you do her workout at least 3 times a week. Of course I do other workout still, like Petra's Sweat Factory which are faster, but I  see the different shape I have since I started this new DVD. Congratultaions Petra! I'm a die hard fan and you still loook ever so wonderful!!",1093737600,12,737,4.45925925925926

8005381,4,B000127ZAA,"Gotta love Petra! Good instruction, love the three different levels, quality video production.  The intensity works well for me, I wish the weight segments were longer, but they provide a good break from the cardio intervals.  I'm a very active 70+ senior and workout with DVDs 5 times a week.  Always looking for a new routine that gets my heart pumping and muscles in shape and my weight in check.  This DVD doesn't disappoint.",1475193600,,429,4.756756756756757

8005383,5,B000127ZAA,Great work out video.  I regularly use it and have been using it awhile now. Still love it.  She has a really nice personality and not annoying at all (in my opinion). Challenging yet not so stupid hard that I never want to do it again.  I recommend for all fitness levels.,1412812800,,273,4.211538461538462

8005385,1,B000127ZAA,"I work out 3 days a week...45 minutes cardio on the eliptical and 20 on weights and this was hard for me to do. It would get easier with practice but I found it too boring so I won't bother trying it again. Also, I prefer smoother moves that are easier on the  knees..",1410134400,2,268,3.962962962962963
8005386,5,B000127ZAA,"I am a fan of Petra Kolber exercise videos.  I would say I am an intermediate as far as fitness levels go.  Easy to follow;  modifications demonstrated for lower impact/lower level exercise ability.  For my abilitiy, it is a very good workout without being way too intense.",1404604800,,273,4.74468085106383
8005387,5,B000127ZAA,"I love the workout videos that Petra Kolber does.  Her directions are clear and you don't always have to be looking at the screen to see what to do.  She gives clear progressive steps to a more complicated workout.  And her encouragement keeps you going.  Another nice thing about this video is that she gives you three options on the minute bursts; others I have done only give two.  This may not be the most intense cardio out there, but it works for those of us not wanting to be ""insane""!",1374278400,,492,4.362637362637362
8005388,3,B000127ZAA,"I liked the workout ok except I don't have very good knees and some back problems so the kickboxing part I don't enjoy much but the rest of the dvd is fun and upbeat which is the normal style for Petra, glad she's still around doing fitness videos.",1346976000,,248,4.1875
