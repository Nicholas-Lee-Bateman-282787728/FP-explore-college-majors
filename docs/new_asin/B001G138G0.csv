8326451,5,B001G138G0,"This DVD went covered a lot of the topics I liked.
I would reccomend that any nickelback fan have this for their collection.",1378166400,,124,4.434782608695652
8326452,5,B001G138G0,"This is the first Nickelback DVD I ever purchased, It is awesome It is one of the best presents I have ever bought for myself",1357171200,,125,4.04
8326453,1,B001G138G0,"First, Let me highlight a couple notes from the box cover: ""THIS SET IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY NICKELBACK"" and ""This product contains no original music by Nickelback""

Well, luckily Nickelback was not involved in the production of this nonsense because it would be a sure way to alienate their fans.  Much of the audio is muddled, and large portions are actually panned photo stills rather than real video.  On the positive side there wasn't much worth listening to so the muddled audio didn't detract much from the overall lousy product.  Anybody involved in the creation of this DVD should be embarrassed about taking money for this.  At least, I borrowed it from the library so it saves me the hassle of sending it back to ""Chrome Dreams Media"", demanding my moneyback ( close to a Nickleback pun!) for their crappy DVD.

In case it is not clear, don't waste your money on this.",1305676800,6,876,4.69281045751634
8326454,1,B001G138G0,"I bought this in the hopes of seeing live footage of Pickelback, but instead I was tortured to the tunes of 4 hicks playing some craptastic commercialized music (if you want to call it music).

If you watch this Chad Kroeger will appear at your house in 3 days and take a dump in your living room. I think the nasty dump he took in my house was way more appealing then the crappy music I had to listen to.

Buyer beware.",1266969600,2,420,4.109756097560975
8326455,1,B001G138G0,I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has a good taste in music. Not to mention the dvd had no footage of nickelbacks crappy live shows or songs but it was 3 hours of Chad crying about how a pickle is more popular than he is on facebook. Sounds like someones on his period.,1266969600,2,282,4.053571428571429
8326456,1,B001G138G0,This product is unauthorized & has NO concert footage or music at all in it.  I bought it as a gift & the recipient hated it.  It didn't even have interviews with the band members.,1232323200,18,180,4.114285714285714
