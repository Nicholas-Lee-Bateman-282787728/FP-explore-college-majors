8124631,5,B000FM9LVW,"This beautiful video documents Bill T Jones' ""Still/Here"" project.  He reveals himself to be a sensitive and extraordinary man as he guides groups of people (not dancers) who have life threatening illnesses through ""life story"" movement experiences.  The participants in his workshops know that they are offering their stories and their movements to be used by Jones in his creative process.  Out of the movements of these ""ordinary people living with serious illnesses"", Jones then develops dance choreography.  At the end of the video the finished product of his opus, Still/Here, is presented.  It is all the more meaningful because the viewer has been taken through the creative process and can see the connections to the workshop participants in the polished and athletic moving of the dancers.",1311552000,,799,5.25984251968504
