4518849,3,B0050Z4XP8,"Picture quality not top notch.  My old VHS tape copy of this which I recorded years ago from AMC (which evidently this DVD was also) is better quality than this DVD.  But I know this probably will never be released on DVD in better quality, I am keeping it.",1319673600,8,257,4.224489795918367
4518850,3,B0050Z4XP8,"I'm very disappointed with the quality of this DVD.  Up to now, every movie in the Universal Vault Series I've bought has had decent picture and sound, and I've been so pleased that they're able to release little-known movies with this burn-on-demand technology.  However, the picture for ""And Now Tomorrow"" is terrible!  There are little shadow images that follow people around when they move, which eventually gives me a headache.  The taped-off-AMC copy I used to have was better.  What a bummer.

The movie, though, is very good.",1460592000,9,533,5.0
4518851,3,B0050Z4XP8,Again universal have released another good movie with AlanLadd and Loretta Young but the picture and sound have not been clean up there is hissing on the sound and the picture is ok seen a lot better. I brought the R2 dvd a lot cheaper and it just the same. I had hope when universal put this one out on demand I hoped it was going to be restored. Anyway i hope they will keep releasing more of the old movies for us  I also got the other 3 Alan ladd films but not seen them yet hope they are better. If they had restored this film I would had given it 5 stars.,1458518400,8,561,3.9210526315789473
4518852,3,B0050Z4XP8,"This romance film about a wealthy young woman (Loretta Young) who becomes deaf after contracting meningitis and a idealistic young doctor (Alan Ladd) who has been experimenting with a new serum to restores hearing in the deaf was made from Rachel Field's last bestselling novel of the same name. A strong supporting cast Susan Hayward, Barry Sullivan, Cecil Kellaway etc. helped the movie.  Originally the male lead was to be Joel McCrea, then Franchot Tone and ended surprisingly with Alan Ladd.  Both Ladd and Young were enormously popular with the fans and both of them had legions of fans.  You might note that while both turned in fine roles, the romantic magic between the two did not seem to be there.  They had made a film ""China"" together and at one point Young pulled out of the film and then returned.  Ladd had vowed never to work with her again.  Being real professionals they both stepped forward for the film.  Decent film and worth a watch.  Ladd and Young fans will enjoy their favorites.",1426377600,,1005,4.735632183908046

4518858,2,B0050Z4XP8,"It was taped from the AMC channel years ago.  AMC hasn't been in the ""no-commercial"" format since 2003 or so.  I could have taped myself then.  The quality could have been better, and the price was way too much.",1385251200,8,211,4.358974358974359
