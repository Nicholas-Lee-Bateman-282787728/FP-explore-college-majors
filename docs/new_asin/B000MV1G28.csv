8172489,5,B000MV1G28,Why isn't this movie available on dvd? The Hoffa movie starring Jack Nicholson can't hold a candle to this movie and Robert Blake's portrayal of Hoffa is by far superior than Nicholson's! Please don't wait another 30 years to make this tv movie easily available to the public! This tv movie is CLASSIC!!!,1324339200,6,304,4.754716981132075
8172490,5,B000MV1G28,I have just seen Blood Feud with Robert Blake on fox movies channel. I can not understand why it is not available on DVD. I would like to purchase a copy for my collection. The movie interested me very much. I would like to know more about it. I would think others would like to add it to their Kennedy History collection. Thank You!,1312588800,7,333,4.21875
8172491,5,B000MV1G28,"I watched this made for Tv film years ago as a child and found it so interesting that I wanted to find out more about Hoffa and the Kennedys. Because of this film I was inspired to read Arthur Schlesinger's Robert Kennedy and His Times at the age of 9.
Todate I have found no better film version on Hoffa than 'Blood Feud' by Robert Blake and hope that it will be released on dvd by amazon asap. I would very much like to add this brilliant piece of film work to my Kennedy dvd collection!",1312329600,5,489,4.104166666666667
