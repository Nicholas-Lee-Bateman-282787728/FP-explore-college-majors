3099334,5,B0012XIGVE,"What better way to spend a rainy day, or an otherwise unpromising evening..?
I'm so very pleased with this set, although I have not yet viewed all the films.
Top of the Heap...
This version of Pride and Prejudice... starring Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle can't be beat, the entire cast is terrific, and the characters are beautifully played and meaningful...  This version is my personal favorite, a total classic, and in my humble opinion, the best film version of the film (of which there are many) ever made.  This version gives you far more background detail/the little in's and out's of the time frame of Jane Austen herself, from the book than the other shorter versions of this story in film.  I'd say this version is positively tops.
((Although Note: the more recent version of P&P with Keira Knightley, & Matthew Macfadyen is perhaps in many ways more lively, or in some ways more charming..))IMPORTANT NOTE.. THAT VERSION IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SET, but is also a personal favorite of mine.
As for the other films in this set, however, also included are:
Emma and Jayne Eyre, which are also rate as very worthwhile.. I also very much enjoyed Lorna Doone, as well as The Scarlet Pimpernel.
I've not yet viewed Victoria and Albert, Tom Jones, or Ivanhoe, but now that this set is again out of the cabinet, I'll be sure to watch them in the coming weeks.",1376784000,2,1360,4.634854771784233
3099335,5,B0012XIGVE,I'd bought this before for my wife. We lost it during our recent move -- and I knew I'd have to replace it. Thanks so much for excellent everything!,1363996800,,148,4.137931034482759
3099336,5,B0012XIGVE,I really like that this set has a lot of the good movies.  I have enjoyed watching all of them again.  I especially like Pride and Prejudice.,1358553600,,141,4.185185185185185
3099340,3,B0012XIGVE,"I ordered the Romance Collection Special Edition expecting to get Pride & Prejudice, Emma, Jane Eyre, Ivanhoe, Tom Jones, The Scarlett Pimpernel, Lorna Doone and Victoria and Albert.  However, I received Pride & Prejudice, Emma, Jane Eyre, Vanity Fair, The Great Gatsby(never liked Gatsby)The Magnificient Ambersons, Catherine The Great and Victoria and Albert.
Needless to say I was some what disapointed.  The Scarlett Pimpernel has been a favorite, Great Gatsby, I can't stand. Vanity Fair and the Magnificient Ambersons I don't think has ever been anyone's favorite.
The quality is good, no problem with any of the discs.  When I got my package and opened it, I immediately checked it against the item ordered. That is when I confirmed it was not quite the same.

brilliant. It was worth the money.",1322092800,,219,4.7631578947368425
3099342,5,B0012XIGVE,"You get a lot of movie time for you money.  I was a bit on the fence before buying this item, because so many of the movies I'd never seen or never heard of.  But while I've technically only watched two of the movies so far, they were so lengthy!  In a good way!  I was surprised at how much entertainment pleasure this gave me.  I look forward to other rainy days or no internet days when I'm just longing for a good movie to watch....or begin to watch with the length of some.
You will definitely not be dissatisfied with this purchase.",1315785600,2,538,4.184466019417476

My husband bought this for me for part of my Valentine's day present and it is AWESOME!

If you love the A&E movies, this is perfect.  You get a little bit of everything.  Well worth it just for Pride and Prejudice.  Who can resist Colin Firth?

All the movies are excellent.  Definitely something that you can put in on a rainy day and relax.",1304640000,2,768,6.9375

3099353,3,B0012XIGVE,"As a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice, I have been watching the VCR version for years. I thought I would update my collection with the DVD version. What a disappointment. The colorization is HORRIBLE. Faces are washed out; backgrounds are faint. It is very distracting to watch and very disappointing because this was the primary reason I bought this collection.

This is a real shame and a disservice to such an excellent production of this wonderful book.

So far the other movies that I watched aren't affected by this unfortunate problem.",1295136000,14,541,4.869565217391305

3099355,5,B0012XIGVE,"There is absolutely no doubt that this is a superb collection of period films and well worth acquiring. But I was more than a little shattered to note the comments referring to the inclusion in the collection of 'The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling' and indeed what it may suggest about our current age. The film is firmly based on Henry Fielding's classic novel 'The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling' published in 1749 in a period noted for its directness and ability to call a spade a spade, even within the highest social circles. Lusty Tom balanced a hearty appetite for beautiful women with a warm heart and an essential goodness, strayed not entirely as the result of his own faults, and was finally rewarded with the girl he had always loved. In many ways a moral tale. Those films in the collection which were based on 19th century novels were written in the context of an entirely more conservative and prim society, evidence of the pendulum that moves historically between high conservatism and liberalism.

Made in 1963 and now reaching its fiftieth year, this romp of a film, one of the glories of British comedy, was the run-away winner of film accolades for that year taking out the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Score and Best Screenplay as well as the British Film Academy Award for Best British Film, Best Film From Any Source, and Best Screenplay. The film was a showcase of great British actors of the period including among many a brilliant young Albert Finney, the delicious Susannah York as his great love, Joan Greenwood, Edith Evans, David Warner, David Tomlinson, seductive Diane Cilento, Hugh Griffith, and Lynn Redgrave.

As the title of the collection is 'The Romance Collection', personally I applaud the inclusion of this great film classic. Romance occurs in all ages, not least the 18th century. This film provided a refreshing balance to a very high quality offering.",1294358400,17,1917,4.841463414634147
3099356,4,B0012XIGVE,"I bought via Amazon Marketplace, but it was New, still in the original shrink wrap. The content, production values, acting, etc. are generally very good to excellent, and 30 hours of entertainment for the price is good value. However, I have one problem with this set which keeps it from getting 5 stars, the packaging. One of the discs simply falls out of the case, you have to catch it every time, and another disc is somewhat loose. I can find no remedy for the problem, so I will probably end up storing the discs in something other than the original case. if I could separate the two, I would probably give it 5 stars for content, but zero for packaging.",1291334400,5,659,4.454545454545454
3099357,5,B0012XIGVE,"I bought this for Pride & Prejudice, but the bonus is that you get all of these other excellent movies, like The Scarlet Pimpernel, Emma, Jane Eyre, etc.  It's well worth the cost!",1288656000,8,180,4.454545454545454

3099371,5,B0012XIGVE,I love this collection and since it arrived quickly I have been able to enjoy it a few times and still have some more of the collection to view - but it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Very happy with this product.,1267747200,,225,4.232558139534884
3099372,5,B0012XIGVE,"How can you go wrong with a collection of these wonderful romances?!

The collection is beautifully done and definitely a keeper. I keep thinking of people I should give them to because they would love them, but I just can't give them up.

There are times in my life when I just want to slow things down and enjoy a romantic novel that I don't have to read. Those are the times when nothing good is on television and I'm just too tired from working on my computer for hours to want to read anything.

This collection has a permanent place in my home.",1266278400,10,550,4.269230769230769
3099373,1,B0012XIGVE,"I am familiar with most of the stories and given that my husband enjoys watching these with me I figured it would be a great Christmas gift to each other.  I was really disappointed because while Emma, Jane Eyre, and Lorna Doone were fine, Pride and Prejudice and Tom Jones are skipping often and sometimes we can't get through the scene - we have to stop and go to another scene, or my husband just gets really frustrated and doesn't want to watch the end of the movie.

This happened with Little House Season 1 (he bought that for me) as well - I noticed the reviews there mentioned similar quality issues.",1266105600,15,608,4.419642857142857
3099374,4,B0012XIGVE,"Hard to beat the number of flics for the price.  Really enjoyed most of them and will view them over and over for years, I am sure, but found Tom Jones too raunchy and sex-obsessed for our tastes and have retired it to our frisbee collection.",1266105600,19,242,4.260869565217392
3099375,2,B0012XIGVE,"The inclusion of Tom Jones in this collection leaves a bad taste for the whole product.  The inclusion of nudity and immorality was unnecessary.  I am sure that the screenwriter and director chose these portrayials but it ruined the crediability of the set.  I put the Tom Jones DVD in the trash as I do not want that type of material in my home.

The Jane Austin films are good, the other films were interesting but due to the above I would not have purchased the set had I known.",1259884800,52,481,4.311111111111111
3099376,5,B0012XIGVE,"Absolutely wonderful collection with all the great romantic movies I love...except Sense and Sensibility. Even with that omission, it is my favorite collection and worth every penny paid!!!",1258675200,5,189,5.785714285714286
3099377,4,B0012XIGVE,I liked most of the movies but Ivanhoe and Tom Jones (all about his sexual exploits) were just too much!!  Pride and Prejudice I enjoyed very much because of the period and seems to stick close to the book.  I like British dramas but didn't care for the above two.,1254355200,9,264,4.26

3099379,5,B0012XIGVE,"This collection is absolutely wonderful.  I have enjoyed every one of the productions.  My husband happened to come by while I was watching Lorna Doone and he decided to watch every one of them.  It took a while to watch them; however, it was time well invested.  The very best are Pride and Prejudice, Lorna Doone, Emma, and Tom Jones. Jane Eyre and the Scarlet Pimpernel are almost as good.  It took us a while to warm up to Ivanhoe, but we did.  You get a set of movies that will give you hours and hours of viewing pleasure for a very reasonable price.

But while I've technically only watched two of the movies so far, they were so lengthy!  In a good way!  I was surprised at how much entertainment pleasure this gave me.  I look forward to other rainy days or no internet days when I'm just longing for a good movie to watch....or begin to watch with the length of some.

My husband bought this for me for part of my Valentine's day present and it is AWESOME!

If you love the A&E movies, this is perfect.  You get a little bit of everything.  Well worth it just for Pride and Prejudice.  Who can resist Colin Firth?

All the movies are excellent.  Definitely something that you can put in on a rainy day and relax.",1304640000,2,768,6.9375

The colorization is HORRIBLE. Faces are washed out; backgrounds are faint. It is very distracting to watch and very disappointing because this was the primary reason I bought this collection.

This is a real shame and a disservice to such an excellent production of this wonderful book.

So far the other movies that I watched aren't affected by this unfortunate problem.",1295136000,14,541,4.869565217391305

3333852,5,B0012XIGVE,"There is absolutely no doubt that this is a superb collection of period films and well worth acquiring. But I was more than a little shattered to note the comments referring to the inclusion in the collection of 'The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling' and indeed what it may suggest about our current age. The film is firmly based on Henry Fielding's classic novel 'The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling' published in 1749 in a period noted for its directness and ability to call a spade a spade, even within the highest social circles. Lusty Tom balanced a hearty appetite for beautiful women with a warm heart and an essential goodness, strayed not entirely as the result of his own faults, and was finally rewarded with the girl he had always loved. In many ways a moral tale. Those films in the collection which were based on 19th century novels were written in the context of an entirely more conservative and prim society, evidence of the pendulum that moves historically between high conservatism and liberalism.

Made in 1963 and now reaching its fiftieth year, this romp of a film, one of the glories of British comedy, was the run-away winner of film accolades for that year taking out the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Score and Best Screenplay as well as the British Film Academy Award for Best British Film, Best Film From Any Source, and Best Screenplay. The film was a showcase of great British actors of the period including among many a brilliant young Albert Finney, the delicious Susannah York as his great love, Joan Greenwood, Edith Evans, David Warner, David Tomlinson, seductive Diane Cilento, Hugh Griffith, and Lynn Redgrave.

As the title of the collection is 'The Romance Collection', personally I applaud the inclusion of this great film classic. Romance occurs in all ages, not least the 18th century. This film provided a refreshing balance to a very high quality offering.",1294358400,17,1917,4.841463414634147
3333853,4,B0012XIGVE,"I bought via Amazon Marketplace, but it was New, still in the original shrink wrap. The content, production values, acting, etc. are generally very good to excellent, and 30 hours of entertainment for the price is good value. However, I have one problem with this set which keeps it from getting 5 stars, the packaging. One of the discs simply falls out of the case, you have to catch it every time, and another disc is somewhat loose. I can find no remedy for the problem, so I will probably end up storing the discs in something other than the original case. if I could separate the two, I would probably give it 5 stars for content, but zero for packaging.",1291334400,5,659,4.454545454545454

The collection is beautifully done and definitely a keeper. I keep thinking of people I should give them to because they would love them, but I just can't give them up.

There are times in my life when I just want to slow things down and enjoy a romantic novel that I don't have to read. Those are the times when nothing good is on television and I'm just too tired from working on my computer for hours to want to read anything.

This collection has a permanent place in my home.",1266278400,10,550,4.269230769230769

I was really disappointed because while Emma, Jane Eyre, and Lorna Doone were fine, Pride and Prejudice and Tom Jones are skipping often and sometimes we can't get through the scene - we have to stop and go to another scene, or my husband just gets really frustrated and doesn't want to watch the end of the movie.

This happened with Little House Season 1 (he bought that for me) as well - I noticed the reviews there mentioned similar quality issues.",1266105600,15,608,4.419642857142857

3333872,2,B0012XIGVE,"The inclusion of Tom Jones in this collection leaves a bad taste for the whole product.  The inclusion of nudity and immorality was unnecessary.  I am sure that the screenwriter and director chose these portrayials but it ruined the crediability of the set.  I put the Tom Jones DVD in the trash as I do not want that type of material in my home.

The Jane Austin films are good, the other films were interesting but due to the above I would not have purchased the set had I known.",1259884800,52,481,4.311111111111111

My husband happened to come by while I was watching Lorna Doone and he decided to watch every one of them.  It took a while to watch them; however, it was time well invested.  The very best are Pride and Prejudice, Lorna Doone, Emma, and Tom Jones. Jane Eyre and the Scarlet Pimpernel are almost as good.  It took us a while to warm up to Ivanhoe, but we did.  You get a set of movies that will give you hours and hours of viewing pleasure for a very reasonable price.  The quality is excellent - I already owned Pride and Prejudice and Emma and the quality in this set is exactly the same as the quality of my dvds.
