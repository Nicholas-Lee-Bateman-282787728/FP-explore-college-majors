8307761,5,B001H493NI,"This is really a great box set as it contains a total of four discs.

The Adventures Of Mimi:
It's the greatest concert of Mariah's and definitely way better than her previous DVDs. Her hits from 1990 till Emancipation Of Mimi are quite evenly represented. Includes behind-the-scenes and juxebox feature. Excellent audio and picture quality.

The Adventures Of Mimi - Tour Documentary:
I enjoyed this, especially the part where the girls were bitching about Carey in the ladies' room.

E=MC2:
The #1 album with Touch My Body and Bye Bye.

Mariah Carey Interactive Disc:
This CD Rom Connects you to various offers. I could access some but not others. Depends on the programs in your computer and your locale.

The classy black box comes with a pretty key chain with initials MC, a double sided fold out poster and a DVD/CD hybrid booklet.

I got mine for $12.95 and it was totally worth it. Don't worry Mariah, I won't be asking for refunds :)",1357603200,,942,4.713414634146342
