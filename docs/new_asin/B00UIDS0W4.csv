7045185,5,B00UIDS0W4,"A clever, off-beat film about relationships. Chris Evans is charming and watchable with a satisfying character arc and the supporting cast is great, especially Topher Grace and Aubrey Plaza. It does an interesting job acknowledging and subverting romcom cliches while not being too jaded to give in to them when it counts.",1427760000,9,322,5.211538461538462

7045192,4,B00UIDS0W4,"Chris Evans is so cute in this movie. In fact, so much so that I barely remember this movie's other actors or plots, or anything aside from how cute he is.
Ok, so it's not what I'd consider a GREAT movie.
It's a spin on the Four Weddings and a Funeral theme: misogynist douchbag has too much casual sex and relationships, then misogynist douchebag meets girl and is no longer misogynist douchebag but a caring and sensitive grown man.
It's every woman's ultimate fantasy (or mine at least), in other words. Played out by a hot guy who, though most of the movie, is doing super -cute self-deprecating things. You just can't lose with that combo, no matter if you were born a woman or are just channeling your inner woman.
It's worth a watch. It's actually rather humorous, as well.",1489190400,,780,4.539007092198582

7045202,3,B00UIDS0W4,"This is a romcom authored by self-indulgent writers.  They bask in the glory of their own wit and insight.  Unfortunately the movie is only occasionally funny, and the insight is cliche-ridden.  The lead actors are fine, especially Michelle Monaghan.  But the movie is excessively talkative, and the ending does not justify the long and scattered paths to arrive as its predictable conclusion.  The potential for a good movie was there, but the writers didn't deliver.  O.K. for viewing on a rainy day when you are bored with the cable offerings.",1480291200,,546,5.011111111111111

On a side note: I also want to say I like that they didn't make a big deal over the gay character. I swear it must be mandatory in Hollywood now to have some kind of homosexual which really bothers me. But in this movie they have a guy who is gay (the main character's best friend) without shoving it in your face, he's just going about his life and it actually takes you a few minutes to realize he's gay so to me that was beautifully done and I was very pleased to not have the gay thing shoved down my throat for once.",1454889600,3,785,3.962025316455696

7045303,5,B00UIDS0W4,"I am about to disagree with everyone who has reviewed this before me. Chris Evans stars as a disillusioned writer with a big imagination that consists mostly of hot women yielding to his every desire. He is indifferent to the whole concept of true love until he meets HER (Michelle Monaghan), a breathtaking young woman who shakes all his previous beliefs. His buddies, all fellow writers, give him way too much advice, mostly along the lines of getting lucky before getting in too deep. The one thing they do not tell him is to lie through his teeth, which he ends up doing just so he can spend time with her. When the truth comes out, all hell breaks loose and he ends up as the star in his own tragedy. That is the story. Mine is that I am not a big fan of RomComs, but when you have such a wonderful pair as Chris Evans And Michelle Monaghan and the wonderful back up cast. I defy you not to enjoy it, is it formulaic, yes but done with panache and style for this cast.",1444262400,12,973,4.236559139784946

7045355,5,B00UIDS0W4,"***Warning spoilers****
  There are two big indicators this is not a ""rom-com:""  first, the production studio is a small independent studio; second, it has a ""R"" rating for sexual content and language.  The former reason is the biggie - lovers of rom-coms should know that no traditional, mainstream rom-com would receive a ""R"" rating.
  Although I am giving this a five-star rating (and it is not because it is by any means Oscar-worthy, but it is enjoyable), I have to say there is little chemistry between Chris Evans and Michelle Monaghan; however, I might suggest even that problem fits within this non-love story.  The real chemistry comes from the four other actors who are ""Me's"" group of writer friends.
  For those who love Steve Rogers/Captain America, please understand one will not find that character anywhere in this guy.  Evans' character in this movie lost his mother at a young age (he first thought she ran off to Chile with a guy as she left in a note, but later discovered she died) and from that time on set his heart off to the side-literally.  I have to admit I adore Evans' non-speaking portrayal of his disenchanted, chain-smoking heart.  I found his depiction of his cynical heart was much more charming than the primary character ""Me.""
  If one is looking for love and heart in this movie, there is only one character to visit and that is Topher Grace's Scott.  He not only reminds us of what we like about rom-coms, but he is the one character who is not scared to show that he cares for people.  He openly and unashamedly believes in love and romance and his unwillingness to hide his beliefs often leaves him mocked by his group.
  Evans' character speaks about being ""in love,"" but he says he is not sure he even believes in love.  He is also ""in love"" with a woman he is not sure believes in love either.  While in the end he does say ""I love you,"" the audience never actually hears the same from ""Her.""  Revealingly about half-way through the movie Evans' character had a chance to disclose the biggest hurt in his life, the death of his mother, which manifested in his inability to even look at a box of Captain Crunch cereal, but ""his heart"" waves him off.  While having sex with the object of his obsession allowed for him to renew a relationship with The Captain, he still does not open up as to why his heart is damaged to ""Her.""
  As ""Me"" writes/imagines himself in his own rom-com, we see he has at least considered the fact love and romance can be exciting and not this dark thing we all crave and yet despise.  In the end, we see ""Me"" and ""Her"" decide to try a relationship.  I may be reading too much into this, but I think it says quite a bit that his heart has stopped chain-smoking and taken up tap-dancing and yet has still not returned to ""Me's"" chest.  When it comes to the future of the relationship I do not see marriage and a family:  I imagine ""Me"" is going to wake up one night with ""Her"" putting a pillow over his face.
  All-in-all, this is a movie about a man who was able to find he could love again.  This was not about ""falling in love"" with a woman, but healing from the loss of the first woman he ever loved and loved him.  In the end he realized we may experience pain, but we will only get pleasure if we accept the inevitable pain.
  If one is looking for a rom-com, one will be sadly disappointed.  If one is looking for a little indie film with a mixture of quirky characters who act like they do not believe in romance, but are always writing about it, this is your movie.  The trailer sells this as a rom-com;  this was not as bad a bait-and-switch as Vanilla Sky, but it still did not exemplify this movie.  Forget ""Me"" and ""Her.""  I believe ""Her"" may not have a heart to give, but the other supporting cast who seem to have no heart actually have it in abundance.  Fortunately, ""Me"" realizes how much love and caring he does have from the people in his life, regardless how the ""Her"" relationship ends up.
***Addendum***As I was re-reading my review I noticed how much I used the term heart.  I guess that message must have gotten into my subconscious as I only just realized how much ""heart"" imagery is used in this film.  ""Me"" and ""Her"" go to a gallery where the displays are ""heart"" oriented by way of them listening to a recording of a Humming Bird's heart sounds and then going and playing with some stethoscopes that where hanging on the wall.  Then the ""rom-com"" moment (which he may have stolen from Scott describing his love for ""running through the airport scenes"" and some of the other stereotypical rom-com situations that are shown), ""Me"" runs around San Francisco looking for ""Her"" at all of the ""heart"" statutes, only to find ""Her"" at the statute of the bow and arrow which ""shoots hearts.""  I think that this movie truly was about the ""Me"" character trying to find the ""heart"" of the matter.  With ""Her"" choosing her romantic spot to be at the place that ""shoots hearts,"" I have just now, completely convinced myself that she does not really believe in any sort of love. Convenience and safety, maybe.  Sex, definitely.  Love, NO.  This might have been an on the nose moment where it was intended that the bow and arrow through the heart meant that she was Cupid and has finally captured the heart of ""Me,"" but really I think this relationship is going to be like the Bon Jovi song where ""Her"" shooting ""Me"" through the heart is going to ultimately give love a bad name. I can only hope that when ""Me"" discovers that he does not have a cynical heart but one which is capable of an appreciating love that he will dump ""Her"" eventually and go  find himself a nice girl.",1436659200,2,5655,4.44368932038835

So bad. It has an amazing cast that I wanted to see succeed in this movie...but it just didn't happen.

Firstly, I never got any chemistry coming off between the leads to sell me on this being a love story that could rise above RomCom tropes while also embracing AND making fun of them.

Which right there, big problem. I know from interviews, that Chris Evans (the unnamed lead character in this film) enjoys a good rom com--however, I think he might be the only one involved in production of this film who does. This film was almost never funny and definitely not romantic. It is best watched thru Youtube clips of Tumblr gifs.

I'd love to see Chris Evans in a really successful romantic comedy, as I think he definitely has the charisma and acting ability for it, this wasn't it though. Both Nanny Diaries and What's My Number are better at being somewhat romantic and Not Another Teen Movie is definitely funnier (which says a lot).

Here's the pros: great cast, great setting, some interesting efforts at being creative (best one was C. Evans character putting himself in others' shoes--including a historic K-drama sajeuk...)

cons: NO chemistry between the leads, really weak characters and storyline, not funny or romantic really",1435276800,2,1244,4.816901408450704

He's a man pursuing a woman in a movie with some humor and let's face it... much like whiny-white-boy angst music - this is a version of heavy metal music's one-hit music ballad put into a screen version released to DVD.

7045397,2,B00UIDS0W4,"Playing It Cool comes off as one of those fraudulent Hollywood rom-coms right from the start. Chris Evans, so good and believable as Captain America or in a movie like Snowpiercer, has yet to hit his groove as a romantic lead, and it's not entirely his fault. He's got charm to spare and works as a regular guy looking for love, but the screenplay hits on too many clichs to be believable, ironic because Evans' character warns us about exactly that.

One of those winking ""meta"" comedies too clever for its own good, Playing It Cool centers on an unnamed screenwriter tasked with writing a rom-com by his sexist agent (Evans' Captain America co-star, Anthony Mackie), with the promise of a lucrative action movie gig afterwards. There's just one problem, Evans' character has never been in love because his mother left him as a child and now he's just another guy afraid of real commitment. If you guessed all of this changes on a dime when he meets the perfect woman (Michelle Monaghan) then you've won the big prize! The problem is that she's committed to a boring perfectly decent but conveniently unavailable boyfriend (Evans' Fantastic Four co-star, Ioan Gruffudd) who obviously lacks Evans' spark. In fact, when Evans and Monaghan first meet there's a literal flash of electricity.

Visual touches like that go a long way in making the film somewhat enjoyable for a time. Originally described back when it was titled A Many Splintered Thing as a whimsical cross between Amelie and (500) Days of Summer, there are some fun fantasy elements that first-time director Justin Reardon plays with. When Evans' character dreams of a romantic scenario, or even just hears of one from somebody else, he imagines himself as the lead and these scenes are realized as live-action or animated fairy tales.

But the film soon falls back on more familiar plot elements while exploring whether men and women can really just be friends. He's aggressive in pursuit, she's reluctant; he can't handle being in the ""friend zone"", she wants to have her cake and eat it too, yadda yadda yadda. This story was done more honestly last year in The F Word, and by many other films before that.  There's an easy chemistry between Evans and Monaghan, but the female perspective is largely ignored by screenwriters Chris Shafer and Paul Vickner, who also wrote Evans' directorial debut, Before We Go. Through a ton of overdone, overly familiar speeches about love we know why Evans' character wants her but nothing about what she wants, and of course she's totally weak-kneed to his charms.

If there's a saving grace it's the talented cast that makes up the screenwriter's closest friends, who admittedly are still a bunch of genre stereotypes. Aubrey Plaza is the scorned girl who secretly pines for Evans, Topher Grace (another Marvel alum) is the friend who believes in the pure power of love, while Luke Wilson and Martin Starr are the slobs who offer all the worst advice. They're still more entertaining than the central romance which has initial spark but, like a bad relationship, quickly fizzles out.

Evans has long lamented that his fans only seek out his Marvel work while his indie projects are largely ignored. Playing It Cool isn't likely to change that, unfortunately. Despite some enjoyable visual cues, it's neither witty nor perceptive enough to stand apart from better movies that have tread the same romantic territory.",1431129600,12,3417,4.923611111111111

Michele is good, but the chemistry was a bit lacking. The supporting cast of friends were great however i wish we got more of Topher and Luke Wilson, they are always funny additions to a cast and didn't get enough air time, especially Luke. This is all about a screen writer with a case of writers block who puts himself into the lead character role of every story being told to him from someone else's life. Problem is, he's always the main character because he's a bit self absorbed. He finally meets a girl that's a bit unattainable and falls into that dreaded friend zone that can certainly turn into a black hole. This is about him getting out and realizing that this girl means something. But as pretty as he is and as much as things may fall into place for him, this situation is a first for him.

I know the two leads are capable of much more interesting work than this,for instance Monaghan was great playing against her wholesome, pretty leading lady type in Trucker and Fort Bliss.  And why does Cooper want to play this off putting neurotic ladies man or whatever he's supposed to be, when he's ""Captain America""?

The movie does try to make the characters quirky. But as another reviewer pointed out, it is not even clear what the plot or the main character is really trying to accomplish here. And even with the ""quirky"" characters, it seems just like another disposable rom com Cooper was in ""What's your number""?

And here's a personal pet peeve of mine:  the main character talks about the Luke Wilson character being ""too old"" to hang out with his tiresome group of neurotic silly friends, but they allow it. Wilson, who is close in age to Monaghan is too old? I swear I've seen Wilson in the lead for one of these dumb films fairly recently, not to mention Cooper is already well into his thirties. Does Hollywood want anyone not in their twenties to lock themselves in their home and never do anything interesting again?

It does have a good B level actors cast, there's plenty of them in this, even a lot of cameos that last a scene or maybe even come back for another later in the film from actors in TV shows now off the air like Rules of Engagement, Glee etc.  Basically it's the story of a guy who doesn't believe in love, since his mother broke up with him as a parent when a kid, leaving a note on the back of a cereal box in his granddad's house.  He has plenty of female friends with benefits, but refuses to commit.  Then of course he meets a quirky woman at a fund raiser who is as critical of everyone else in the room as he is, and is prepared to play mind games with them.  But then she tells him she has to go when her boyfriend arrives at the venue and walks over.
