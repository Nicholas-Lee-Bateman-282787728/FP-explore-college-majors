8019709,5,B00020X8XO,"This has to be one of the most fun DVDs I have ever purchased. Amira starts you out right away with a cute routine that I think would be easy even for beginners. You get to see the final product before you begin, so you're motivated to complete the sequences. (Note: If you are a beginner, you may want to get an introduction to bellydance terms before you start, because some foundation in bellydance would be helpful before starting this DVD. But I think even if you never tried bellydance you could pick up the moves without being completely lost.)

At first I thought it would take forever to go through all the steps, but then I realized Amira had planned everything out to go quickly and easily. The beginning sequence is repeated three times, so that makes the dance flow well. I like the way the whole routine is taught in sequence without unnecessary repetition. I just hate it when an instructor picks something apart so that it seems impossible to ever accomplish. I also hate it when an instructor goes over something so many times that you become bored and frustrated. Amira has found the right balance between teaching too little and too much. I think Amira's approach in this video will build confidence and make dancing fun, like it should be.

It's not often I come across something that I'd like to give six stars, but this is one of them.",1330300800,,1357,4.557377049180328
8019710,2,B00020X8XO,"She's pretty, it's true.  And that's the extent of the good things I have to say about this DVD.  I plugged it into the DVD player, walked off to grab something, then came back and stared as I watched what could only be described as something that made me say, ""really?"" over and over.  The choreography consisted of a lot of hair flinging and cheesy moves.  Period.  I believe she has talent to an extent, and this DVD could have been SO much better.  Maybe she MEANT it to look more like a stripper's belly dance?  I don't know.  It'll never be inserted into my DVD player again, that's all I know.",1299542400,,600,4.294642857142857
8019711,3,B00020X8XO,This is not a beginners video!! You need a basic knowledge of belly dance to use it.  I have no prior experience with belly dance and absolutely could not get it from this.  I put it aside and ordered a belly dance basics for beginners.  It's working better for me.,1283385600,,265,4.26
8019712,4,B00020X8XO,"I have had a hard time finding a DVD that is a workout and not a slow beginner instructional. These moves are both simple and usable and she doesn't waste too much time slowing down with explanation. If you already know the basic moves of bellydance, you can employ them with this workout and really build up a sweat. This format is unlike a lot of the other Amira Mor DVDs, by the way,which I have found to be a waste of time, so beware....happy shimmies!",1233878400,4,456,4.313953488372093
8019713,3,B00020X8XO,"I enjoyed this DVD because she repeats the exercise quite a bit, but I have to admit that I am a fast learner with everything, and I know quite a few people who would get frustrated with this and leave it. I, myself found it easy to follow, the only downside being that she doesn't want you to mirror what she's doing. She's talking to you as if you are a student of hers, or part of her troupe (IE - as if you are behind her, following her lead, instead of in front of her trying to mirror it) so that was a little confusing to me, so I didn't like that I had to do more thinking and do that opposite of what I was told.

Overall, I enjoyed a decent low impact workout. I want to get another video of hers, and probably will buy the guide to your souldmate (I think that's the name). But again, if you have not taken dance classes before or if you are not a fast learner with mimicking people, then I'd say this video isn't for you.",1150848000,10,933,3.9893048128342246
8019714,2,B00020X8XO,"This video is like watching auditions for a dance troupe or show. The leader shows you what choreography they want to see, runs through it a couple of times, and then, hey presto, you then replicate the steps they want to see. The problem is, there is a basic assumption that you already know HOW to do the steps. Fine if you are an experienced dancer that already knows the ""how"" and just needs to know what order they are to be presented in.  If, however, you are not experienced enough to know how to do them, or perhaps just don't pick up on and memorize what to do in four quick run thoughs, then this is not for you.  My point is that you won't learn how to do anything from this video, just how to put together combinations based on things that the video assumes you already know.  On the cover, however, it states it has ""easy to follow instruction"" and is for ""beginning students to seasoned professionals"", which just seems a bit misleading to me.",1118448000,25,957,4.365168539325842
