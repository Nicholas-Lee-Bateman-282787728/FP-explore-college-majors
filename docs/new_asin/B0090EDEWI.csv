5200822,4,B0090EDEWI,"I watched this movie with expectations of it being mediocre but I was surprised. Some parts of the movie are quite funny and you will absolutely want to take Chilly Christmas (the dog's name) home with you forever. The rest of the characters are also quite endearing, although I found myself thinking Tom Arnold made somewhat of a lackluster villian.

The basic plot is that a boy, Bobby, (maybe 10?) and his father live in what I believe is the small, fictitous town of Sunshine Beach, California. Somewhere along the line dad (an above average police detective with a stellar apprehension rate) has become a widower (mom was also a police officer) and he and his son are clearly still trying to cope with the loss even though you get the idea it has been a while since mom's passing. The story opens on Bobby at the Christmas tree opening his presents. Except the puppy he was to receive has escaped and a chase around the Christmas tree ensues. The dog becomes Chilly Christmas (the breed is supposed a rare Koren one but my household suspects Chilly is actually an otterhound) and Chilly does not believe in discipline. One year later we find, like every other silly dog movie, Chilly destroys most everything he gets near. This becomes problematic when Bobby's dad is asked to join the FBI to head a task force in New York, where Chilly will have no wide open backyard to frollick and dad fears he will destroy the apartment. Meanwhile, multiple kennels and pet stores are being broken into with valuable rare dogs being stolen for some nefarious purpose never revealed other than the kidnappers are set to make lots of money. Naturally when dad puts Chilly, this rare dog breed, on an adoption website, the dog nappers close in and try to steal him. This is all unbeknownst to Bobby, who is trying train Chilly to become an indoor dog with the help of his friends Kizzy (a tomboy) and an absolutely great little boy named Caps (explained in the film, he was my favorite character). Eventually the police, including Bobby's dad, figure out who the dog nappers are but it is Bobby who saves the day and Chilly.

The plot is predictable but most movies like this are. However, the writing for this movie is good, the acting is not too bad and Chilly is so cute! The good thing about this movie is you can watch it with young children. The villian is hardly even worth a gasp let alone frightening and the hijinks will keep little ones amused. Dog lovers will like watching the struggles with Chilly and the unorthodox training methods used to make him an indoor dog. This may not be an annual watching like some other holiday classics but it is good enough to add to your Christmas movie collection and watch on some wintery weather day where you just want a good movie and a cup of hot chocolate. Highly recommend.",1353369600,7,2818,4.589285714285714

5200825,3,B0090EDEWI,"I love animals and xmas movies, so I thought this would be a shoe-in. Not so much! I found this movie to be slow moving and predictable. I don't usually have a problem with predictable as long as it's entertaining but Chilly Christmas misses the mark for me. Chilly, the dog is the best part of the movie but he's not the ultimate in endearing animals. That said, Your kids may enjoy this movie, but adults might want to lower their expectations.",1378857600,,446,4.451219512195122

5200830,5,B0090EDEWI,"This movie is very entertaining for our kids who are 3, 7 and 9 as well as for the parents.  So, any movie that keeps us entertained as well as the kids gets an A+ in my book.  Hope this helps!",1359072000,2,193,3.682926829268293
5200831,5,B0090EDEWI,"Seasonal kid entertainment at a great price. In a market where live actors and animals can be hard to find a midst all the animated cartoon productions, Chilly Christmas offers a welcome relief.

And I like the fact that the story line shows kids working to find a solution to a problem, turning to trying to fix their dog's problem behaviors through training. A simple concept that seems to elude too many adults these days where pets are viewed as disposable and problem behaviors deemed insurmountable without even trying.

Chilly Christmas isn't an adult movie, but it's cute, clean fun for kids. And no animals nor values were harmed in the making of this movie.",1358726400,2,667,4.791304347826087
5200832,2,B0090EDEWI,"I was disappointed in this movie.  The acting was not good, nor was the story line.  I cannot recommend it and I'm an avid Christmas movie fan.  It has a very appearling artwork, but it just isn't a good movie.  Perhaps younger children would enjoy, but not an adult.",1356912000,,267,4.387755102040816

8533250,4,B0090EDEWI,"This has a few familiar faces: Tom Arnold and C. Thomas Howell among them.
An 11-year-old boy, and, his dog ""Chilly"" are best buds, happy in their California beach house.
When Bobby's, single, dad (Howell) accepts a job in NYC, they must find his dog a new home.
Trying to show that Chilly can be a CITY dog, the boy and his friends teach Chilly the ""indoor"" way of life.
Dad isn't convinced.
It isn't till Christmas Eve when a dog thief (Arnold) breaks into the house, that BOY 'n' DOG put their
new training to the test!",1455840000,,522,4.336734693877551
8533251,3,B0090EDEWI,"Another addition to the hundreds of dog related Christmas time of year set movies, Chilly Christmas like most of them can be viewed any time of year as the Christmas aspect is pretty small, mostly just props like the tree in the background and the start of the film the main character receives the dog as a Christmas present.  What the movie follows a couple of days in rich kid that lives in a huge beach house in Sunshine Beach, California's life. Bobby is of the type who is a target to bullies on the school bus, and is intimidated by an assertive girl his own age. He  finally seems to be getting somewhere with that girl after Chilly saves the day on their school bus when his father drops the news that he has been offered a job by the FBI in Manhattan (doesn't tell him that his local police boss will fire him if he doesn't take it anyway).  Of course there is no place for a dog Chilly's size in a Manhattan apartment who destroys their existing house whenever Bobby sneaks him inside.  The father puts the dog up for adoption on a website while Bobby and his friend are determined to sabotage any would be adopters so that in Bobby's mind they won't be able to leave.  When that doesn't work. Bobby and his friend enlist the help of the intimidating girl, determined to train Chilly and prove he can be a good inside dog so the dad will let him come to New York.

The trio of kids are the main screentime wise stars of the film.  The main character is pretty much an unknown actor as you 'd expect from a low budget straight to DVD movie.  As is the intimidating girl, but you'll recognise Bobby's best friend Caps, (Karan Brar) as a classmate from the Diary of Wimpy Kid movies, as well as being the kid with the pet monitor lizard in the Saturday morning show Jesse.  He plays pretty much the same character in this film as those two characters.  You probably won't recognise but you'll know the name from his childhood star actor days in Red Dawn, The Outsiders and E.T of C Thomas Howell, who plays Bobby's dad in this one.  It also has Tom Arnold in a minor screen time role as probably the most lame and unthreatening bad guy ever in a movie, who seems to be in a fair few straight to DVD dog Christmas movies minor character roles.

Chilly Christmas is watchable but nothing great.  There's some aspects that are just ridiculous such as Bobby and his dad live on the beach, yet when they leave the house for the day they leave the door unlocked (which the misbehaving Chilly simply opens with a paw).  This makes even less sense when you remember that the dad is a police officer. Although he does put an alarm in days before they move, I guess as a selling feature for the house. A house that I wonder how he and his wife when she was alive afforded as police officers, guess they were corrupt at some stage. Not to mention Chilly just sleeps outside all day (and night) as well with a gate that has no lock so not only can he get out himself but anyone could simply steal him.  Sometimes characters are suddenly wearing different clothes to what they were seconds before.  The ending scene involving Tom Arnold isn't played out real well on the screen, we sort of have to jump to some conclusions as to what just happened as we do with a scene of the dad and his replacement blocked by a train when the replacement says he can get them there in 30 seconds. Did he jump the train or what?  We'll never know. I'm guessing the film was originally supposed to have taken place in Hawaii and they just changed it to California in post production since it has Hawaiian Christmas carols playing at different stages on the soundtrack.",1453161600,,3646,4.353982300884955
