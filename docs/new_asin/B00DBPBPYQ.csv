5787565,5,B00DBPBPYQ,"We have watched all of the episodes on Animal Planet (multiple times) & it's GREAT! Family-friendly, entertaining, and the wardens are just awesome! We especially love Warden Kris MacCabe & K9 Morgan, and Warden Alan Curtis & K9 Cruizer! Daughter & I are huge fans and can't wait to get all of the episodes on DVD!",1378598400,5,314,4.625

5787568,5,B00DBPBPYQ,Again watching another series on Amazon has been incredible.  The price is right and the shows are the best.  Years ago I wanted to be a officer of the law; my other choice was to join the Navy during Nam.  I went Navy but always respected and admired officers in law enforcement.  Thoroughly enjoying watching the dynamics and the quality of the show and getting it WITHOUT commercial interruptions.,1449187200,,400,4.753623188405797

5787570,5,B00DBPBPYQ,This is the only television show I have watched in 20+ years. Seriously! I like the wardens and that you see that they have a real love and respect for what they do. The animals of Maine are beautiful and seeings the different parts of the state is interesting. Each warden has their own quirky personality and they seem very down-to-earth and real. An enjoyable show to watch for the entire family.,1445904000,,399,4.555555555555555

5787574,5,B00DBPBPYQ,"There's a program on Animal Planet called, ""North Woods Law"". Although everything on it is true, I hesitate to call it a ""reality"" show because of the baggage the phrase, ""reality show"" carries along with it. Reality shows generally involve waste-of-space Kardashians or oversexed, drunken denizens from Down South or the Jersey Shore or battling MILF Housewives or Mobwives or whatever kind of ""wives"" are well past their cheerleader, glory-day prime and crave their fifteen minutes of degrading ""fame"" like a junkie craves smack. North Woods Law is nothing like any of those. It's more like ""COPS"" but without the annoying theme song, without the swarms of knucklehead criminals with no shirts and with State Game Wardens instead of cops. North Woods Law is actually pretty cool. A site I found for it in an online search describes North Woods Law as, ""Set in Maine, the show follows numerous game wardens of the Maine Warden Service from various regions of the Pine Tree State."" Yep, that pretty much sums it up and I swear, before seeing this show, I had no clue exactly how wild and unpopulated the state of Maine actually is. And for the most part, the cases the show follows are a total hoot. If you enjoy the occasional full grown moose with his antlers tangled in a backyard swing set, this is the show for you. Wanna see some hard-drinking, out-of-staters hauling in waaay too many fish without so much as one fishing license between them and then trying to deny everything? Here you go! Care to see some ""hunter"" getting the shock of his life after wardens pop out of the underbrush to catch him on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere trying to VERY illegally blast a deer with a rifle from the front seat of his pickup truck? We got that too! The wardens are honest, seriously dedicated and as hardworking as the day is long and their cases always make for some pretty interesting, and sometimes funny, stuff. Let me give you just one example of how cool the episodes, and the wardens they follow, actually are. On a recent episode, a landowner called the warden service (in the deep-wood, wilds of Maine, apparently you don't call the cops when there's a problem, you call the wardens) to report someone had planted a flourishing crop of ten or fifteen marijuana plants hidden on his forested land. The landowner wanted the plants removed. The warden came and obliged the landowner by digging up the plants and hauling them away. Then the warden went one better. He returned to the spot with an equal number of flowering plants he'd purchased with his own money. Then he carefully planted one of them in each of the blank spots where the marijuana plants had been. Then, before departing, the warden placed his business card there with a note inviting the dope farmer to call him if he had any questions. That is the kind of show North Woods Law is. Pretty damned cool.",1431648000,,2883,4.6660117878192535

5787579,5,B00DBPBPYQ,"Excellent show, I can't wait to watch the next show every time one ends.",1418860800,,72,4.214285714285714
5787580,5,B00DBPBPYQ,"I have a few friends in the Warden Service.  They always tell these crazy stories and you're left thinking there's no way that can happen in the real world.  Then you watch the show and sure enough, it happens.

It's great to have a show that shows how challenging their job is.  Some of the people they meet out in the woods are real characters and the accents aren't fake either.  Some of the wardens are real characters too.

If you're from Maine or just ""Maine-curious"" this is a great show to watch.  If you have a relative from Maine and you're looking for a cool gift definitely consider giving them a DVD of North Woods Law.  There's something for everybody whether it's the Maine woods scenery, the ""cops"" style action or the interesting characters that they run into.",1418256000,2,777,4.539568345323741
5787581,5,B00DBPBPYQ,I love watching this series. The episodes are very interesting and hold your attention.  Maine is such a big state that I am always amazed at what the wardens accomplish each day.  I don't have cable so I am waiting for more to come out on DVD.,1417046400,,244,4.170212765957447

5787584,5,B00DBPBPYQ,"Can't tell you how much I LOVE this TV series. I have  all the episodes of the other two seasons. So I am eagerly waiting for Season 4 coming in May.  What could be wrong with watching some incredibly
fit males & females and dogs, Cruze and Morgan, do their jobs.
  Whether
 they are hiking, searching with dogs, or tracking bears on ATV's thorough the mud; a delightful sense of humor seems that seems
to abound.",1397174400,,413,4.381578947368421

8591440,5,B00DBPBPYQ,I wish you had discs for the rest of the seasons to buy. I enjoyed this disc. Please show the old shows on TV. They are so much better than the ones mad  in New Hampshire They don't get old and are well made. I hope you go bsck to Maine someday.  Thank you. M. Pearson,1517270400,,268,3.767857142857143

8591443,5,B00DBPBPYQ,"I have really liked this program.  I'd like to see a disc set featuring just the K-9s and their handlers and feature some of the training methods used. I had a scent specific trailing dog I'd trained and am always impressed by how intelligent dogs are, particularly when some people seem to lack the smarts of a well trained K-9.",1483747200,,329,4.483333333333333

8591448,5,B00DBPBPYQ,This is the best reality show if you like good old fashioned real people who are still doing their jobs.
