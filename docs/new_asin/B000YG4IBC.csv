The Hearns vs. Duran fight is the only one with an English soundtrack.
For the price a barely decent value. I really wouldn't buy such a messy amateurish DVD if I had to do it again.",1375920000,,318,4.229508196721311
8232638,4,B000YG4IBC,"GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 5 offers up Michael Carbajal vs. Humberto Gonzalez I, Ricardo Lopez vs. Rosendo Alvarez I, and Thomas Hearns vs. Roberto Duran. So, okay, going into these fights now, in the order they're shown on the DVD:

Michael Carbajal vs. Humberto Gonzalez I (March 13, 1993):

Little man brawls usually mean bunches of punches, and if these guys happen to have pop in the glove, then these make for fast-paced, really exciting clashes. Accordingly, high drama and frequent combustive moments color this really great fight, the first in a trilogy between Humberto ""Chiquita"" Gonzalez and Michael ""Manitos de Piedra"" Carbajal, both of them tremendous punchers in the light flyweight division. Gonzalez had it his way early, was the aggressive stalker, with the then undefeated and mullet-hampered Carbajal settling for being the effective counterpuncher. Early on, though, Gonzalez was like the friggin' Terminator, taking all of Carbajal's best shots with a stoic resolve and just advancing, ever advancing.

Gonzalez committed to the body with some punishing shots, some of them borderline low, if you go by shiny-domed referee Mills Lane's warnings. Carbajal demonstrated big heart by surviving a knockdown each in the 2nd and 5th round. Round 7 would prove to be the decider as a left hook from the ""Little Hands of Stone"" would send Gonzalez reeling into the ropes. Moments later, Carbajal would dispatch Chiquita to the ground, from where he was unable to beat the count.

Sucks for Carbajal that he'd go on to lose the rematches with Chiquita by close decision. But his ballsy effort on this evening would be enough for him to be named 1993's Fighter of the Year and this barnburner designated as Ring Magazine's Fight of the Year. By the way, the fight commentary is in Spanish.

Ricardo Lopez vs. Rosendo Alvarez I (March 7, 1998):

Undefeated fighters in this next one, which means that someone's ""O"" must go - except, it turns out, not really. Ricardo ""Finito"" Lopez, the elegant and well-schooled master technician, did go undefeated in his boxing career, accruing a staggering final record of 51-0-1 with 38 KOs. He was 46-0 with 35 KOs when he stepped into the squared circle against the hard-nosed, heavy-handed Nicaraguan Rosendo ""El Bufalo"" Alvarez. Alvarez himself at the time sported an unblemished record: 24-0 with 16 KOs. This was for Lopez's strawweight championship belt and would turn out to be the first of their two bouts.

For those who've seen the stylish Finito fight before, it must've been shocking to see him so out of sorts. These cats may've been fighting at a measly 105 pounds, but Alvarez was a strong, bullish fighter. In the 2nd round, a sneaky timing right hand from Alvarez would catapult Lopez to the canvas for the first time in his career, and it seemed that he began second guessing himself from then on. Normally a beautiful counterpuncher, Finito just couldn't get off and you've got to credit Alvarez's determined assault for that. The fight was also marred by accidental headbutts and, in the 7th round, Lopez suffered a hideous cut over his right eye, causing the fight to be stopped and declared a draw. All in all, an inauspicious evening for Ricardo Lopez. Still, in his rematch eight months later, he'd get his groove back.

Thomas Hearns vs. Roberto Duran (June 15, 1984):

Fight night at Caesars Palace. By this time some luster had been knocked off Roberto Duran's vaunted aura, dude having already lost to the likes of Leonard, Benitez, Hagler just the fight before, to Esteban de Jesus, and to some cat named Kirkland Laing. Thomas Hearns - a menacing 6'1"" figure and touting a nightmarish right hand - certainly wasn't intimidated, not if you go by the pre-fight staredown. Duran stood markedly shorter at 5'8"". At 32 years old, the bearded Panamanian was already past his prime and contending way north of his ideal weight class (which was lightweight). He was 77-5 with 58 KOs going into this one; Hearns was 38-1 with 32 KOs. In two very one-sided rounds the Hitman would crack the bejesus out of the game Manos de Piedra. Two brutal knockdowns in the first round would be clear signposts, and a scary right hand would render Duran momentarily immobile before he crashed to the floor. Fight night over, this DVD done.",1263772800,4,4289,4.912983425414365
