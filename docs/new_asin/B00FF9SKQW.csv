5988158,5,B00FF9SKQW,"Whilst the critics have furnished mixed reviews, I was most impressed when I saw it at the cinema.  It is most unusual if I see a film more than once at the cinema; I saw this three times.  Granted, there is a complex plot, with two story sequences, the early 1970s and the present day, containing a number of intruiging themes.  Fine performances by Jeremy Irons, Melanie Laurent, Jack Huston, Christopher Lee, Charlotte Rampling and others, whilst Lisbon itself has been photographed magnificently.  The film has a great blend of being thought-provoking and entertaining.",1395792000,2,573,5.0638297872340425
5988159,5,B00FF9SKQW,"This art house film got very limited release, which is really a shame because it has a great story line and a terrific cast.  Jeremy Irons is superb (no surprise there...he's always fantastic), also Charlotte Rampling, Jack Huston (from Boardwalk Empire), etc.
I consider this a must see....a nice story, a little mystery....no one gets blown up, no violence.  We loved it.",1392422400,5,373,5.0
5988160,4,B00FF9SKQW,"A complex yet satisfying journey for a man from his academic conservatism through chance encounter to life expanding self discovery. Potential European purchasers should be aware of the US regional code assigned to this DVD. Good enough to support repeat viewings, particularly perhaps for intending visitors to Lisbon. Interesting additional interviews with the director and principal actors. Excellent characterisation, and cinematography of this exotic enticing and affordable city. E-book and paperback also available.

5988161,4,B00FF9SKQW,"I haven't read the book so I can't compare, but this is a sweet, wistful film about modern men bound tightly in fear who yearn for a life and find it wherever/however they can.  It is, of course, about much more than that, too.  But when all is said and done, it is the final scene (a kind of thematic summary) that stays with the viewer and provokes, as intended.",1391990400,3,364,4.185714285714286
5988162,1,B00FF9SKQW,Having watched most of this film on a flight I was dying to see the end so when I got my NEW DVD I was thrilled but everything was blue and green wash which was just awful.  The RED coat which is striking in the movie was a dirty Brown. All the characters were slightly green.  Unacceptable and I don't recommend the seller at all.,1391472000,2,331,4.076923076923077
5988163,5,B00FF9SKQW,"A touching, thought-provoking, and multilayered account of one man's journey of discovery of life in Portugal under Salazar's dictatorship.

5988164,4,B00FF9SKQW,"I liked the casting, even though, while reading the book, I pictured Mundus as a small and slightly hunched over man. By necessity, many characters and pieces are left out of the film, and I did not always agree with what they changed (the ending, most importantly) or what they had chosen to keep in the movie, but in general, this is a work that accurately reflects the inner life of the two men, one living and one long dead. If you, like me and the other reviewers, enjoy films that encourage  appreciation for the kind of journey made by Mundus, you will like this one. But DO read the book. Awkward as the translation sometimes is, it is a marvel of a read.",1388016000,15,663,4.346774193548387
5988165,5,B00FF9SKQW,"I watched this movie on a plane from Germany to Boston. I didn't even know it existed, nor the book. I immediately fell in love. I am 19 years old, but I understand why so many suggest it is for an older audience. It requires understanding and thought. I am now reading the book, and love each individually. There are definitely words to live by represented in both. His graduation speech.... my heart....",1382659200,32,405,4.561643835616438
5988166,5,B00FF9SKQW,"This is an adult film that slowly opens and reveals step by step the layers of life's complexity. So you know already it is not for everyone. It is thoughtful and careful and constructed like a game of chess. I enjoyed it greatly and thought about it often after seeing the film; however for those who want action, they may find this film a bit slow. A young woman attempts suicide and is saved by a teacher of Latin and the classics in a Swiss private college-prep school. He obtains her rain coat by accident and in a pocket is a book by a Portuguese poet and physician, Amadeu de Prado, and the mystery of who is the young woman and why did she try to kill herself expands greatly to begin to explore the life of this young idealistic intellectual physician/poet who resists the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal.

Jeremy Irons plays the Classics/Latin teacher Raimund Gregorius who virtually abandons his teaching position to go to Portugal to solve the mystery of the young suicidal woman but also to uncover the life of Prado. The film does a wonderful job of contrasting the passion, danger, intrigue, competition, romance of the life of Prado who died 30 years before the film starts with that of Gregorius, a 57 year old man who has selected to live a life of scholarship rather than passion. Through this exploration of the life of Prado, the life of Gregorius begins to change and grow. In fact, as Gregorius encounters the sister, fellow revolutionists, best friend, and lover of Prado, he not only begins to solve the multiple mysteries of this film but he also begins to lose his own identity and begin to construct a new identity.

The life of Prado is fascinating and highly dramatic, but it is revealed in passages and memories however the events of his life are revealed chronologically so the film is never confusing, just mysterious which is an achievement.",1382227200,48,1876,4.681818181818182
5988167,4,B00FF9SKQW,"A warning: I have NOT read the book, so this is a straight movie review; no comparisons, no complaints, no issues of fidelity to the original, etc, etc. Also, it is written before the DVD release, based on viewing the film in a cinema.

This is NOT a film for everyone. Its pace is slow (something that, personally, I like) and its  plot is `human' (rather than the more or less unrealistic type that seems to be the current trend). It is for someone interested in personal issues, old-fashioned perhaps, moral dilemmas and romantic views of life. If it sounds OK to you, try the film; if not, stay away.

If you are still interested, there is yet another aspect to consider. To enjoy the film you have to accept certain improbabilities in the plot. I try not to reveal too much about the plot but I don't think this is a spoiler: how likely is it that a boring older professor would actually climb on a night train and escape to Lisbon on the spur of the moment? Well, if you are OK with this second set of hurdles you are going to enjoy the film!

What made the film attractive to me was its pace, the simple without `fireworks' direction, and its reliance on the actors to move the story along rather than on the editing. Also, that it is not too serious, there is comedy in it, there is a mystery to be solved. However, what really won me over was the fact that it actually had people talking, discussing things. Discussions that were not just about who did what; but they were about why did people behave one way or another; why did they do the things they did. The point, of course, being why the main character is doing what he is doing: a night train ride into the professor's mind.",1382140800,27,1690,4.3386075949367084

5988202,4,B00FF9SKQW,"Jeremy Irons plays a Swiss college professor who stops a Portuguese lady from suicide and decides to travel to Lisbon, Portugal to return her book and coat. In Lisbon, Irons learns all about the former lives of revolutionaries that at one time tried to overthrow the semi-fascist Salazar dictatorship (the last European country to give up its African Colonies).  The film utilizes the now elderly European mostly art film actors Lena Olin (Sweden), Tom Courtenay (UK), Christopher Lee, (UK), Charlotte Rampling (UK) and Bruno Ganz (Germany) to play the currently living rebels to tell the story of their attempts to overthrown the dictatorship 30-40 years in the past. Irons contemplates  his boring existence while he listens to the courageous stories of the youthful rebels, trying to withstand torture, beatings,  and a tragic romantic triangle.",1414281600,,848,5.313432835820896

5988205,4,B00FF9SKQW,This is a good movie version of the book with a little bit of Hollywood thrown in.  I think reading the book first would be beneficial.  It is a very well written book that leads where you do not expect.  This is a very thoughtful read and movie.,1409529600,,246,4.083333333333333
5988226,5,B00FF9SKQW,Great movie. I am originally  from Lisbon and I felt the need to see  the connection.  I enjoyed the story and the scenery. I would recommend it.,1408838400,,145,4.296296296296297
5988227,5,B00FF9SKQW,"I loved the novel, read years before viewing the film.  I love the film also.  In many ways, it captures the essence and tone of the book.  Both are profound, almost poetic, but the film emphasizes the political setting and the meaning of life, while language is an additional theme at the heart of the novel, the author at great length attempting to analyze the essence of words as they intersect with the meaning of life.

Atheism is a theme in both,  treated simplistically in the film, as it relates to the leftist resistance at the conclusion of the Salazar dictatorship.  In contrast, the struggle between atheism and belief is a constant thread in the novel, the Swiss teacher of Latin grappling from the very beginning with his personal history and an attraction to Christian words, symbols, and liturgical form, while unable to commit his intellect to a personal God.  His persistent lack of faith leaves him a brave, but empty and uncertain character at the end of the work, facing his own mortality as he begins treatment for a potentially life-threatening illness.

On a number of levels the novel is a far more profound work, but it has a few loose ends that the film resolves quite nicely, not the least of which is the identity of the mysterious young woman in the red coat, who inspires the spiritual and physical journey of the protagonist.  The film's conclusion is also  more satisfying, altered just enough for a reader who does not crave literary realism, but yearns for the possibility of a happy ending.

As at least one previous Amazon  reviewer pointed out, this is an adult film.  There is no gratuitous sex and little violence, though there are three brief scenes too strong for youngsters, but the existential element makes it impractical for children.  This film is marked by philosophical depth, lushness of place, strong characterization,  and political seriousness,  treating a small slice of modern Portuguese history about which most of us are unaware.",1407542400,8,1986,4.883582089552239

5988230,4,B00FF9SKQW,"There may be spoilers.

This film tells a story, make that two stories, set 4 decades apart.  They are connected of course.  The film is directed by Dane, Bille August, probably best known for ""Pelle the Conqueror"" and ""Les Miserables"" (not the musical).  He tells the tale of Raimund Gregorius (Jeremy Irons), a Swiss literary professor.  On the way to class one morning he rescues a girl about to jump off a bridge.  Before he can inquire about her intent, she departs and leaves behind her raincoat.  In the pocket Raimund discovers a small book written by a Portuguese man named Amadeu (Jack Huston).  As he reads the book he finds the man has a wonderful use of language as he tells of his involvement during the political upheaval surrounding the government's dictatorial rule in the early 1970's.  Raimund decides to catch the next train out of Berne and head to Lisbon, hoping to catch the girl who left the book and/or meet people who knew the now deceased Amadeu.

He first encounters Amadeu's sister, Adriana (Charlotte Rampling) who acts as if Amadeu is still alive.  Through a freak accident, Raimund's glasses are broken.  He seeks out an optometrist (Martina Gedeck) whose uncle Joao (Tom Courtenay) just happens to have been friends with Amadeu in those early years.  Mariana (Gedeck) offers to help Raimund and he accepts.  The film essentially tells the story, in flashbacks, that Raimund is seeking.  We're not sure of Raimund's reasons, other than academic interests.  Each character in the film that Raimund interviews has a different actor playing their younger selves.  In addition to the actors named above, the cast includes additional European stars in the key roles (Melanie Laurent, August Diehl, Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, Christopher Lee, and others).

I was hoping for a bit more intrigue and mystery as the events unfold, but the film is more of a historical telling of the citizen rebellion as seen through the eyes of a few protestors.  Watching requires patience.  Ultimately Raimund's detective work pays off.  So now he must decide whether he must return to Berne and his classes.  It would seem he makes the right decision.  Loved the ending.",1403568000,,2176,4.917582417582418
5988231,2,B00FF9SKQW,"Slow but perhaps interesting for some.  Ignore the hype as it is certainly not a film to remember. Another over-rated American cheaply produced film, thrown together in a hurry to make a quick buck out of an unsuspecting audience.  Something to fill in time with when you've nothing else to watch. Perhaps the book was good. The film is so weak and unconvincing in it's shoddy acting I regret purchasing, let alone watching it.  Maybe the British could have produced a great version of this story, but Hollywood...., sorry,  they just don't comprehend reality. The actors are capable of so much more but the standard was neither set nor achieved.",1400457600,2,646,4.845454545454546

Hauntingly beautiful and profound texts from the book , including the phrase above are both score and narrative  to this richly layered story of young lives affected by the Salazar regime in Portugal, in particular the life of the author of the book. Compelling , gripping and dramatic yet the story unfolds simply without tension, judgment or overstatement.

I would view it again and again just to hear the texts and see those beautiful streets of Lisbon so recommend it as a permanent home library acquisition.  Defintely worth renting.",1399248000,2,829,4.715277777777778

I found it absorbing and thought-provoking and am recommending it to others.  In fact, I recently ordered the novel the film is based upon.
