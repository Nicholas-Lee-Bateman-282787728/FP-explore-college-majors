4858054,4,B005QB2JR0,"There is not a person who has not heard of Jane Goodall and her animal research in Africa.  There have been so many interviews with her and for me this was the first time to see a film about her where she is portrayed as reasearcher, scientist, mother, wife and public speaker.  Jane opens up about her own experiences, both personal and professional.  She is leaving it all in the open.  Her humanity and charisma is so powerful that she charms not only ordinary people and children but also well known actors such as Pierce Brosnan and Angelina Jolie.  Perhaps the most touching part of the film is the part where Jane's relationship with her son is fully disclosed.  There good times and bad and their final attempts to reconcile their conflicting feelings about each other is as sincere as it is painful.

This film also creates awareness of the world of today, need to protect environment and educate young generations about the world they live in.  That is, until young ones get corrupted by adults or just a fraction of them adopts teachings of wise people like Jane that are teaching them that money does not always bring happiness.  One has to look for higher purpose and higher ground in life.

I gave this film only four stars because to some degree I found it to be too idealistic.  However, it carries a fantastic message and hopefully many people get to see this little gem.",1340841600,,1388,4.6016260162601625

4858056,4,B005QB2JR0,"I thought I knew a lot about animal researcher, environmentalist  (and social activist) Goodall - the 78-year-old icon of National Geographic articles about chimpanzees in Africa - before watching this DVD. But nearly two hours later I realized how little I knew. And, honestly, I felt like the interviewer who Goodall refers to near the beginning of the film who confused her with Dian Fossey, whose story was told in the 1988 film ""Gorilla In The Mist"" (with Sigourney Weaver as Fossey). Goodall reminded the interviewer that Fossey dies at the end of the film, so she's obviously a different person!

I agree pretty much with my fellow Amazon reviewer, K. Harris who pretty much covers the feature film in depth. The film is framed by scenes of Goodall making her annual two-week visit to the Gombe area of Tanzania. (She travels away from her home in Bournemouth, England more than 300 days each year!). The film is fully narrated by Goodall herself, with interviews with others in her life, inserted at the appropriate places. The first 20 minutes act as a min-biography, using vintage footage to show how Goodall first went to Africa, worked on studies with chimpanzees, married twice (and divorced twice). Though now much older, with long straight gray hair and minimal makeup, Goodall has maintained the beautiful skin and facial features that made her photogenic to National Geographic as well as her two husband.

But after the chimpanzee portion we find Goodall's other activities. She created a Foundation as well as a program called ""Roots & Shoots"" to get young people involved in the environment. Not only has she helped people clean up waste and protect the forests but also - as we see - she worked with Native Americans on Indian Reservations to try to curb the alcohol and drug abuse of their children. There is a lot covered here - including footage of her winning awards, signing books and giving speeches. I did feel that the Director was trying to cram in too much and, at times, the film started to drag and the smooth jazz score was making my mind wander.  Speaking of music, there are three vocals on the films score, two by Katie Melua - a name unfamiliar to be but I've since learned that she was the ""highest selling female singer in the UK with over 20 albums currently on iTunes.

As if this film needed some ""celebrity"" appearances so as to boost interest, there are short interview segments featuring actress Angelina Jolie, who was appointed by the United Nations to an ambassador post.

The DVD contains ""bonus features"" as well. The longest is a subsequent interview with actress Jolie (5  minutes) where she explains that she met Goodall at the Salt Lake City Olympics. She's asked by the interviewer how SHE has tried to help the environment and pretty much explains that she contributes money. There is also a page of text about the Roots and Shoots Program and a 3-minute video about R&S, A text page about the Jane Goodall Institute and another text page about the film's Director.

If you are a fan of NatGEo specials or Animal Plant channel you will definitely want to see this film. But anyone interested in nature (the film footage will remind you of those shown at the end of CBS' ""Sunday Morning"" each week) or the environment will be drawn in to Goodall's ideas as well.

I hope you found this review helpful.

8483017,5,B005QB2JR0,"This is a beautiful 111 minute documentary about Jane Goodall, an English primatologist, ethologist, anthropologist, and UN Messenger of Peace, tracing her life from a young woman studying chimpanzees in her 20s to the social activist in her 70s during the filming. It consists mostly of beautiful recent cinematography and music interwoven of trips done from approximately 2000 to 2009 with small bits of archival footage of her work and her life. Several moving contemplative moments as she visits a Congo refugee camp, the Pine Ridge Indian reservation, a melting glacier in Greenland, and a hippo pond in Tanzania (with her grown son and two grandchildren). Her message is despite all the problems we have, we must continue to hope and inspire the next generation. At Amazon Germany, one can order a Region B Blu-ray disc of this film that has improved video and sound (DTS-HD 5.1), which is playable on region-free Blu-ray players, but not on standard US Blu-ray players.

This movie is a great example of a young person following her dreams and developing the strength of character to persist in the face of hardship.

The sharing of her passion with young African school children will no doubt inspire some of them to follow in her foot steps.

Long may Jane have good health and vitality to continue her good work.

had the pleasure of reviewing before on yet another DVD of Jane Goodall and my appreciation and respect for this lady is immense.  If you have enjoyed anything that Jane Goodall has written about animal survival in the past, I am positive that you will enjoy her travels and paths in life and where life has taken her and the dedication she has and is giving continually to our world......Buy it as you will not be disappointed in any way I guarantee it.......Sophia",1370995200,4,473,4.564705882352941

Her work is extraordinary, but what I found most inspiring and what has left a deep impression on my heart, is the remarkable peace and poise that radiates from her.  An incredible life and knowing more about it, I feel, has made me a better person.  Gratitude!",1356480000,3,511,4.850574712643678

8483024,5,B005QB2JR0,"I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a wildlife activist and people activist. I was so impressed Jane went to the Pine Ridge Reservation. That is one of my main charities and I love anyone that help them. She touched me so much more in all of the things she does. I have always wanted to be to the wolves like Jane is to the chimps. Unfortunately medical problems have kept me from doing what I wanted in life. But knowing you can still help in different charities by giving money, buying things for wildlife, animals and people is still something we can all do. Jane is a wonderful, wonderful woman. Thank God for people like her. This movie is brilliant and I bought it as soon as I could.",1347840000,,702,4.325757575757576
