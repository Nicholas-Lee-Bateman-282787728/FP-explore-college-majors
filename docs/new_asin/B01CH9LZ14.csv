7683215,2,B01CH9LZ14,This story line has unlimited potential and could have been developed into a much better movie.,1467072000,,95,5.0
7683216,1,B01CH9LZ14,"I got this b/c 1) i dig sci-fi that has to do with epic plagues or killer viruses... and 2) just can't get me enough of that Billy McNamara!! He and Eric Roberts are my favorite ""why-the-heck-isn't-someone-with-your-talent-a-big-star?"" guys...

Well. This is a pretty spectacularly rotten value for a whopping $4.99 for a 7-day rental. But I RESPECT it!

First of all, if you love New Mexico (as I do), you can't help but think this is a love story for the old Fort Bayard Hospital which, at this writing, is probably having it's very last brick being chomped-apart by heavy equipment. The amazing complex -- the first VA hospital ever -- had to be torn down cuz of its obsolescence and asbestos. (""Asbestosolescence?"") Costly to keep it up. So, from what I can tell, PRC looks like a video production house in Albuquerque that does local/regional TV commercials, etc. -- and took this opportunity to say ""farewell"" to a local haunt but also a national historic treasure. PRC Prod. must also do some industrial stuff for the freaky stuff done at the local Sandia National Labs, too. Because that's the type of footage we see in the opening of this film as we hear our dreamboat Billy (who still is a hottie in his 50s) narrate a 2-minute-plus set-up for the story.

Let's be gentle here...and let's be clear...

This is a pretty cruddy flick. Ha! But Billy does a great job carrying all the water -- albeit for only about 38 minutes of this 1:35 film.

OOPS! A spoiler alert? Why? Why give you one? I'm saving you $4.99, fer cryin' out loud!!!

I'm empathetic to PRC Productions, though. I mean... you can't do :30 TV spots and boring, dry industrial videos your whole life! PRC seems to have some fun on the side and make full-length features; presumably straight-to-video (after perhaps a 1-week run at indy theater, The Guild Cinema?) You see the sane actors for their other feature, ""Eaters."" But this time, they coughed up a presumably higher acting fee for Billy Mac and good for him! Billy goes POOF! by the third of the way in to the failm. We're left with a collection of painfully bad actors -- presumably PRC Production Pals...former interns, cable monkeys, pizza-delivery guys...and maybe some extras casting by doing an open call at the Student Union at NM State? Who knows! It's Bad Acting. As ""Leonard Pinth-Garnell"" would say smiling as he golf-clapped, ""Bad! Simply awful! Terrible! Just awful!!"" (If you don't know the vintage SNL sketch? I lost you. But that's OK. Because this FILM will lose you!)

But like I said, I LOVE Albuquerque (lived there for a short while so know how to write the city's name)...I LOVE Billy Mac....and I must say, they did a pretty good job of staging a killer virus with very little fx. But the little things that drove me crazy. If it's an abandoned hospital, why are their lights that work? Dopey plot farts, like, why would a chick wanna pee outside instead of inside -- where a toilet still flushes? Why ""camp"" on the top floor? Why not the 1st floor so you can escape easier? Man! That hospital is CLEAN...for being a derelict abandoned facility. And so is the GARBAGE and items strewn about. I've never seen such clean garbage. Somebody help Billy drag the girl outdoors before they both get shot at 0:39:57?

Oops! Spoiler fail again? Memba: I be savin' you five Dollahz!  Can't wait to watch me some more Older Billy -- but he still looks FANTASTIC!

Thx, PRC Productions! Love your devotion. But your film really kinda...umm...sucks! But you got five dollahz from me! Tha['s entertaining to me alone; i.e, HOW you did that?! PRC Productions. Stands for Pretty Rotten Cinema Productions. I'll take it all back if you just zip over to SADIE's and eat a STUFFED SAPODILLA for me? Or one of those crazy, big-as-a-hubcap cinnamon rolls at the Frontier??? Love!",1466899200,3,3813,4.703148425787107
7683217,1,B01CH9LZ14,Terrible movie. It's close to a amature filming. Should have been free for prime members. Can't believe I paid five bucks for a lousy movie. Should get a refund back for this one. Not even close to one star.,1466899200,5,207,4.333333333333333
7683218,2,B01CH9LZ14,not good. waist of time and money.  5 stars??? you need a 5 step program.,1466812800,,73,3.8666666666666667

8753054,5,B01CH9LZ14,"loved the music at the start ,  the ending was good has left me wondering if the lad at the end is clear of the virus or will their be a no 2  and he starts an epidemic .",1471564800,,170,3.3333333333333335
8753055,2,B01CH9LZ14,"The film opens with a lengthy explanatory monotone about a truth serum virus that mutates and must be contained...or else people act out their ""Impulse"" 1984-Meg Tilly-a film theme that has become recently popular. A college professor (William McNamara) notices the same cloud cover over a place that was there years ago (Is there an app that checks that?) He thinks something is being hidden there and it is not Dick Cheney's house. The crew goes to the remote access location by foot....okay you fill in blanks.

I felt the monologue explanation should have been left out. What happened is explained within the film and a little mystery is good. This one didn't have it, and they could of had it. The acting and dialogue are on par with low budget productions. The truth serum aspect was not as good as ""Liar, Liar."" They needed a funny guy in the group.

No swearing or nudity. Brief sex scene.",1471392000,,897,4.670886075949367
8753056,1,B01CH9LZ14,Great movie if you enjoy bad acting and a pitiful script,1470009600,,56,4.181818181818182
8753057,5,B01CH9LZ14,"I really enjoyed this flick! The story line is cool and the music is amazing (original might I add) so I say ""thumbs up!"" Besides, how often do you get to explore a creepy old hospital dampened with and old lingering virus!",1468454400,,223,4.333333333333333
8753058,5,B01CH9LZ14,"Good movie, love the beatiful translocation and upcoming stars. Music is also original and rocks I don't know if the sound track is available but I like it. Nice to see something that is not made from a comic for a change",1468454400,,221,4.285714285714286

8753061,3,B01CH9LZ14,I am a huge horror but this movie was hard to enjoy. It have bad acting and the story has lots of loop holes. I would say only watch this movie if you are bored and have nothing else to do but sleep. I'd choose sleep if I were you but it's your choice.,1467676800,3,252,3.685185185185185
