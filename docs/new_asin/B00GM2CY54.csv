8624418,5,B00GM2CY54,"The story of The Haunting Of Harry Payne isn't over-complicated or extremely complex but there is enough depth within this drama to keep you enthralled from start to finish. With just enough layers of past, and present to build the characters and still keep you in suspense. Thankfully the actors all give stellar performances that bring the story alive convincingly without overstating or becoming a hindrance. Plus the ending is one that I did not see coming at all. And the supernatural element is a creepy, haunting one that rises to a delightful finale that does not disappoint.

The effects and kills are on the tamer side of horror with most of the deaths taking place just beyond cameras reach-so gore-hounds may be a bid disappointed. However I don't think they will be any less entertained by the deaths because they are more classical moments that tease the brutality with screams, blood-splatter and a few moments of carnage but all in context. The story is a really mature, well executed blend of all the elements that make films like this practically brilliant on the whole. The Haunting Of Harry Payne is a film that should entertain almost any horror fan!",1431734400,3,1171,4.855
8624419,2,B00GM2CY54,"Harry Payne (Tony Scannell) is a hitman who gets out of prison. He buys a pub in the small village of Royleton so he can be near his wife Susan (Katy Manning) a resident of the local sanitarium. Harry is haunted by visions of his past. He also sees ghosts. Meanwhile there is a slasher running around town.

The film moves about. It is a crime film, ghost film, redemption film, and none of it was that great. A film you can pass over.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1421539200,2,478,4.241758241758242
