8625176,5,B0099VUI4Y,This is a VERY good video. So much knowledge and information. It can be overwhelming at times but that's why I enjoy having this so I can sit there with my camera in hand and go step by step with him. I have not found a better instructional video and I think it's great having all the chapters included that explains more than just my camera. I really think this is a must have no matter how much you think you know or don't know about your camera. This has saved me so much time.,1382140800,4,480,4.063157894736842
