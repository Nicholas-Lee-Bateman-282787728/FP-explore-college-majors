4673023,1,B005F96UQ4,"If ghosts are your thing, then Bedlam will be quite the wallow, because there are more spirits than you can say boo to in this haunted mental asylum-turned-posh condo complex. Unhappy ghosts lurk everywhere in these corridors, waiting to pounce on anyone with a sexual peccadillo or illicit skeleton in their designer closets. Though the stories provide plenty of jolts, Bedlam becomes less scary with repetition during its six-episode duration, because we can see these persistent ghouls all too easily. So can Jed, the troubled empath whose past is linked to Bedlam Heights' sordid history.

Jed keeps busy in each episode trying to avert all manner of deadly spectral mischief -- the premiere is big on creepy water effects -- but by the sixth episode, when two of his sexy single roomies are playing with tarot cards in a bedroom full of candles, you figure they're just asking for it. Why don't they all just move?",1320192000,4,919,4.891025641025641

4673038,3,B005F96UQ4,"I love Theo James, but I wasn't ""crazy"" about this series.  It was nice to finally see him in role using his lovely British accent, but the ever changing cast of characters, the residents of Bedlam, left me dizzy.

4673041,5,B005F96UQ4,I absolutely loved the first season of Bedlam. The story was engaging and suspenseful without being overdone. The character development was well paced and I think the actors they had clicked in a great way. I'm usually not into paranormal suspense drama type shows but the style they used to portray the different spirits for this was different and exciting. The only disappointment is that there aren't more episodes with the same cast after season 1.,1445212800,3,452,4.9605263157894735
4673042,4,B005F96UQ4,"After reading some of the reviews, I was surprised no one mentioned that most of the episodes in season 1 are less about the scary ghosts, and more about how the ghosts are related to the living. This show is primarily a metaphor about wrestling personal demons. The ghosts are previous residents of a mental institution, and most( not all) met with an unjust death. We then are introduced to the living characters who are either hiding terrible secrets of bad life choices, or are struggling with making a life choice. The plot intertwines the fates of the living and the dead and Jed, played by Theo James, acts as the medium guide until the truest course plays out. Yes the show is formulaic and soap opera-ish. The characters are all twenty somethings trying to figure out how to be adults. The creepy uneasiness of the show supports the anxiety the characters are going through. It's still a ghost story show, it just runs a little deeper than thrills and chills. If you are predominantly into scares and gore, this probably isn't the show for you. If you like twenty something dramas and the supernatural, you'll love it.",1438041600,6,1127,4.696969696969697

Unfortunately, season two fits not use the same actors, and is not nearly as good. Theo James does not appear at all in session two, very disappointing.",1430006400,,327,5.169811320754717

4673057,4,B005F96UQ4,"There is not very well made horror on tv much. With the exception of Ryan Murphy American Horror Story, I find myself missing it. Came across Bedlam from the recommendation of a friend and am glad I followed up. Great young actors and the creepiest setting make for good tv. Sorry to see that it came and went without giving many answers to the first season. Curious, does anyone know what happened in season 2?",1427587200,3,411,4.493333333333333

4673059,4,B005F96UQ4,Enjoyed this almost as much as the first go round. Lots of odd little twists and turns. Curious about the politics behind switching out the actors for the 2nd series.  But I was pleasantly surprised  in my 'where do I know them from' search for 'Musketeers ' & 'Divergent' to discover that both Hugo Speer & Theo James were both in 1st series of this.,1425081600,,351,4.384615384615385

4673083,3,B005F96UQ4,"I'm giving this show 3 stars simply because it was so cheesy and bad it made me laugh. Honestly, it felt like it would have done better if they had stretched the story arch out and not tried to pack so much into each episode. Maybe then the audience (and the characters) would have had time to breathe and grow. Either way, it wasn't a waste of money but if I'd had the choice I would rather have gotten it for free.",1397260800,,416,4.085365853658536
4673094,4,B005F96UQ4,I really liked this show.  I was upset to have it cut off the way it did.  The end left so many questions and me wanting more.  :(,1396310400,,130,3.5714285714285716
4673095,2,B005F96UQ4,"I'm a die hard Supernatural fan so when this came out I thought it might offer a fun alternative to this genre,but it turns out I was very wrong. Despite Theo James as eye candy and some somewhat interesting characters, this show fails to deliver on the aspect of the back story. It literally leaves you hanging after the last episode and nothing gets resolved. I won't spoil it for you (read my review of season 2 for that). The pilot episode draws you in far enough to continue through at least 2 more episodes but by the third, I was really getting bored. The relationship and tension between our two main characters- Kate and Jed started out well enough and it's clear from the beginning that they have something going although they are billed as adoptive cousins. The other two roommates soon pursue a confusing relationship of their own starting about the fourth or fifth episode and don't get me started on that. One minute a character is gay and the next he's sleeping with his roommate. The entire back story of Jed being born in this institution is never quite explored although they certainly hint at a lot, it's just unclear WHAT exactly they want you to pay attention to. What's also sad is that Kate finally begins to believe or understand Jed's issue of seeing ghosts as she experiences her own supernatural woes but from what I saw she never really acknowledges anything. To top it off they throw in the ""forbidden kiss"" between cousins and then they turn that off like a switch--yet another shoddy attempt at keeping viewers without ever following through on it. If they did intend for there to be a relationship between these two characters they either forgot to write the rest or there was a change in writers or I don't know what. The mystery of disappearing girls is never resolved except for the inkling that the third roomate Molly disappears in the season ender. You also don't know what happens to any of them! Does the other roomate go off and die? Does Jed Die? How is it that Kate and her father survive but no one else does and how is it that an explosion in the basement doesn't cause the entire institution to collapse killing them all? So many questions and none of them answered. It's just garbage. It's sad because if you see this and see it all the way through you could easily think up about 5 or 10 ways to write this and have it turn out better. I'm not saying everything has to have a neat or happy ending, just actually have an ending before you move on to the next season. With the way this ended many viewers, including myself couldn't wait to catch the next season thinking you would get some resolution to these questions. Instead they completely change the characters of the show with the exception of Kate's creepy father and continue with the same boring premise and no answers to the original back story or what on earth happened to the rest of the characters. I won't spoil it by divulging the utterly weak explanations they give as to what happened in the first episode of season 2 but be forewarned- it SUPER SUCKS.",1393718400,3,3066,4.536101083032491
4673096,4,B005F96UQ4,"Show is pretty good. It has the same ""theme"" over and over again, BUT the end leaves you hanging. Overall, a good show with some adrenaline raising parts. Enjoy!",1372204800,,161,4.586206896551724
4673097,4,B005F96UQ4,Theo James who you now can see in Golden Boy is  solid as the guy who can see dead people.  Supporting cast do their job to add to the mystery and scary moments.  Do not buy one episode at a time like I did because you will want to see the whole season.,1370563200,,253,3.7358490566037736
4673098,4,B005F96UQ4,"Not many tv shows can pull off horror, but Bedlam does it well. The characters are interesting, the dialog is never cheesy, and the ghosts are interesting. The downside is that the DVDs are slow to get to America. You will be dangling on a cliff-hanger ending for quite a while.",1368835200,,278,4.470588235294118
4673099,2,B005F96UQ4,"Thoroughly boring. Seems aimed at kids. Decent premise but weak acting and the lead guy's only saving grace is he is nice to look at. Everyone else in this crazy, nonsense show is weak and unbelievable.",1367107200,,202,4.638888888888889

4673102,5,B005F96UQ4,"Unlike US shows season 1 of Bedlam is only 6 episodes long but trust me it's worth it.  While here is a ghost of the week aspect, it is the over riding story that follows all 6 episodes that makes it interesting to watch.  And another benefit is that you'll only spend six hours watching the whole first season instead of hiding away for a weekend not seeing the light of day while watching a series made in the US.",1365379200,,415,4.175

4673124,1,B005F96UQ4,This show was typical entertainment.  I don't recommend it at all.  Nothing new or exciting at all.  Just typical life.,1357084800,,119,4.85

4673129,4,B005F96UQ4,I like BBC shows much more than American television as they seem to all be more thought provoking and cerebral. This new show 'Bedlam' is no exception. Have seen American Horror Story and have to say this show is BY FAR much better. I am a true couch potato and have to say that being an American stuck with American 'TV for dummies' leaves me craving much more of shows like this one out of the UK.,1326931200,4,399,4.194805194805195
4673130,1,B005F96UQ4,"The title of my review says it all. This is a series that is supposed to be about ghosts but, with the exception of one or two moments, the ghosts never seemed to be particularly dangerous. Generally, the worst they did was run up a huge bill for redecorating since all they seem to do is graffiti the walls in a variety of ways.

The series revolves around an old asylum that has been converted into flats. But parts of the building were shown as being completed while other parts were still in ruins; people were falling through floors, endangered by scaffolding etc. Many scenes feature Kate's dad, the owner of the project harping on and on about how they need to sell more flats and why aren't they selling enough flats. I found myself practically screaming at the screen; you're not selling any because you haven't finished building them yet!!! How can you have people moving into a block of flats that's barely even finished? In one scene the character of Mark goes next door to investigate a strange noise. His flat was shown to be completely furnished and comfortable yet the flat directly next door is a hollow shell, looking like something out of a warzone. When exactly does Kate's dad plan to finish them?

The characters themselves were either bland or horrible. The DVD blurb describes Molly as being unemployed and unlucky in love. The blurb has to tell us this because we couldn't learn it any other way. Molly is underdeveloped, boring and even useless. In one scene her bed is set on fire by a ghost. It is only a small fire, nothing that couldn't be put out with a bucket of water. But rather than simply climbing off the bed she sits there screaming for Ryan to come and rescue her. Why didn't she just get off the bed? And as an afterthought, if Molly is unemployed, how exactly is she affording to live in these flats? Those few that have been completed don't look as if they come cheap.

The character of Ryan was equally boring and atrociously acted. Let's be clear about this - Will Young absolutely cannot act! Not one single word did he deliver with even a scrap of believability. The character was also inconsistent - one minute he was straight, then gay, then straight. Pick a sexuality and stick with it. Or, failing that, at least show that the character is conflicted rather than simply swapping them from women to men and back again without any thought for consistency.

Charlotte Salt, playing the part of Kate, is almost as bad at acting as Will Young. How either of them were cast is beyond me. I can only assume that nobody else showed up for the auditions. The character of Kate was nothing short of disgusting. The DVD blurb would have you believe she is the main character but when watching the series I would argue that Jed is actually the main character. Kate is a spoilt, malevolent, selfish, cold-hearted, manipulative, spiteful and vindictive b****. Almost from the word go I was hoping a ghost would just finish her off and give her what she had coming. In one scene, Molly admits to Kate - her supposed best friend - that she has feelings for Ryan. Kate's reaction to this revelation is to wait until Molly leaves the flat before promptly trying to rip Ryan's clothes off. When Molly finds out, Kate's way of appeasing her betrayed friend is to give her the ring Kate's dad found during construction. Great, a second-hand ring. That's just what's needed to repair the broken trust between two friends. It also doesn't take long for Kate to decide that maybe she does like the ring after all and start wearing it herself. Nice.
In another scene where Molly is burned by a candle that she had lit in her room, Kate warns her that she'll have to pay for any damages if the candle has set fire to anything. At no point does she show concern for her injured and frightened friend.

And how many times can we see Kate having nightmares? They all end the same way; with Kate running off down the corridor. Watching it, it felt like this was just an excuse to show off Kate's varied collection of nightwear.

By far the most interesting character, and probably the most interesting part of the series, is Jed. Suffering from a damaged psyche due to his ability to see ghosts, Jed is a troubled character and there was a wealth of potential that could have been explored and wasn't.

The series was littered with endless subplots that go nowhere; Sadie's romance with Jed, the little girl that Jed rescued and the threats of her father to call the police, Kate's affair with a married man and subsequent campaign to destroy his marriage. None of them ever go anywhere and it's incredibly frustrating.

One scene in particular killed the series for me and should have won an award for sheer ridiculousness. Sadie becomes the victim of an angry ghost. Somehow this ghost manages to render her unconscious, then drag her through the whole block of flats and outside to the construction area, lock her in a coffin shaped box and stick her in a convenient coffin shaped hole in the ground to be buried alive by construction workers. This all happens in broad daylight and no one notices??!! And no one hears her screaming??!! And no one questions why they're burying a random box in a random hole when they should be getting on with the flats!!! The illogicality of it makes the viewers out to be idiots.

Above all else I feel I should warn any potential viewers about the end. I'm not giving the end away as there is no end. Just when you think you are getting close to answering some of the questions that have been raised throughout the series, the whole thing just stops. It doesn't conclude, it simply breaks off in an absurd cliffhanger. It doesn't make you want to watch the next series, it makes you want your money back!",1325462400,7,5764,4.566731141199226
4673131,4,B005F96UQ4,"Loved the show, even the non-answers of the season ending episode 6.  Not an over-the-top horror gorefest as so many are these days, but enough spookiness to satisfy.  The 'ghost of the week' premise is a bit weak, but the underlying plot into which these hauntings are tied is intriguing.  There's been development of the characters over the six-episode arc, but the characters still are left with enough ambiguity that anything could be happening with them, and any one of them could be involved in the major over-arching plot.  Hoping we get a second series.

However, the DVDs have a major drawback -- you cannot skip over the commercials.  You have to sit through 4 minutes before you can get to the show.  While I appreciate BBCA's desire to sell other shows -- making me sit through commercials for a show in which I have zero interest EVERY TIME I want to watch this show, pretty much guarantees I will not be purchasing any more DVDs from them.

Unless it's a season 2 of this show.  And even then, I may have to think about it.",1321401600,13,1037,4.532258064516129
4673132,4,B005F96UQ4,"British paranormal urban fantasy with pretty people beset by ghosts. The phantasms are the remnants of patients who had been preyed on by sadists, while housed in a huge old stone and stained glass pile of a mental hospital, which is now being converted to fashionable apartment suites. There has been some character development, lots of gruesome special effects, and uncertainly about who (or what) to trust. But BBC only made six episodes for the first season (aka ""series"" in BBC-ese), so all the characters and plot lines are still unfolding. But for those who seek paranormal shows that go beyond mere teenage hormonal angst, Bedlam is better than average and worthy of attention.",1320624000,2,685,5.017543859649122
4673133,3,B005F96UQ4,"After the great bbc shows like 'sea of souls' and others that have come down the pike, this one is more bland perhaps. The cast is all twentysomethings pretty much , which makes it trying to hard to be the next 'being human' (either version!). the sixth episode may be the last too , and it's a cliffhanger. I did enjoy this series though. It's about  a reluctant medium whose past is tied to the old asylum , now made into apartment complex that's filled with ghosts who interact with the living. (always in bad ways though).  The show isn't that fast paced and hasn't yet been renewed. However , it's hard to see why they would after the got rid of the excellent 'survivors' series and many other fine horror shows.  Even Itv's 'demons' only made six eps and that was really a good horror show. The dvd looks fine and that's the best that can be said about it. Bbc shows are expensive for sure, but most bbc shows are darn good imo. This is a average one and that's ok.",1320624000,2,971,4.295081967213115

8469739,1,B005F96UQ4,"Incredibly bad acting and directing. I expect the quality from the U.K. that was the Gold Standard through the history of cinema. Evidently, that standard is no longer realistic, except for most of what the BBC produces. I think of British people in the arts as being clever, intelligent, witty, with depth. Whoever directed this comes off as moronic, and the acting is embarrassing. The inappropriate expression in the hitchhiker's eyes as he begins to talk with the driver of the car sets the standard. Whoever did the casting did an idiotic job of it. I believe that Americans are devolving, and the number of good reviews for the film provides more proof of that.",1489104000,,667,4.808695652173913

Honestly I couldn't be happier. The best thing about buying from amazon, great deals, makes purchasing easy, and the merchandise is in perfect condition",1480982400,2,306,4.685185185185185
