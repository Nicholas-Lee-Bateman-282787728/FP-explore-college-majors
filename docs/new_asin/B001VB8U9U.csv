3820602,5,B001VB8U9U,"I liked the way this series explores the differences in the ruling class, the upper class, and the working poor. There are times when the lines are blurred, even for the Reverend Simcox. It results in an young man from the village who wants to better himself being used by the ruling class and the upper classes to hide a multitude of sins. He does not realize it because he thinks that his schemes are the reasons for his success. I highly recommend seeing this series.",1330387200,5,470,4.476744186046512
3820603,5,B001VB8U9U,"This was the best ""Masterpiece Theatre"" series in the 1980s - I can't wait to see it again.  Following John Mortimer's novel closely, the plot revolves around a purplexing mystery:  why has a saintly and steadfastly liberal vicar left his sizeable fortune to villainous Thatcherite cabinet minister Leslie Titmuss?  All is revealed in as the series travels back several decades examining the tangled relationships between the middle class families of the Rapstone Valley and the working classes of Skurfield.  The central mystery ultimately serves to illuminate how Britain has changed from the post-war period to the 1980s England of Margaret Thatcher.
The sequel ""Titmuss Regained"" is less sweeping but also bitterly amusing as cabinet minister Titmuss takes a bizarre detour from his political ambitions to attempt personal happiness and romantic love.  Titmuss is an astounding fictional creation - Mortimer wrote a third ""Titmuss"" novel, ""The Sound of Trumpets"" - maybe someday the BBC will dramatize the last chapter in the life of this somehow loveable villain.",1252627200,21,1068,5.409638554216867
3820604,5,B001VB8U9U,"This set contains not only an 11-episode saga (Masterpiece Theatre) but a 3-part sequel to the dramatic story (mystery) of the last will of Rev. Simon Henry Simcox (Michael Hordern), who died at age 82, on February 21, 1985. His financial legacy is left completely to a family outsider, MP Leslie Titmuss (David Threlfall), a politician, one of those Simon marched and opposed through decades of preaching, speaking, and protesting. Why? Why not even providing for his life-long partner, his wife? How could he ignore his sons, and even a grandchild?

Immediately the series begins transitioning to former days in the lives of the family and those connected to the family. Is there a puzzling secret in the Rectory that needs exposed? Sons, Henry (Peter Egan,) and Fred (Paul Shelley) question Titmuss receiving the family fortune, especially for the sake of their mother, Dorothy (Annette Crosbie) left near penniless.  Was he insane?

The search for clues to the will's purpose reveals a past as far back as WWII with characters including Agnes Salter (Eleanor David) daughter of family Dr. Salter (Colin Blakely), Charlotte 'Charlie' Fanner (Zoe Wanamaker) daughter of Sir Nicholas (Richard Vernon) and Lady Grace (Jill Bennett). And a whole Rapstone Village of others including Titmuss's lower-class parents.

This ""Masterpiece"" was written by lawyer/author John Mortimer who died Jan. 16, 2009, after being not only successful with this series but also writer of the 15-year TV series (1978 beginning) of ""Rumpole of the Bailey"". What a tribute to release this series+sequel DVD set so soon after the masterful author's death.

It represents more TOP QUALITY British drama, masterfully reproduced from the original airings in 1986 and 1991.  You'll come away caring deeply, like family, for some characters, and loathe others.

The box indicates some modification for home video was made due to music rights, but fear not, this 738 minutes is worthy of a watch, and re-watch. You still hear some good music, jazz and rock. That's the reason for the 3-episode sequel. Fans love it. Couldn't get enough.

Details for those interested: (CAREFUL; could be a spoiler or two for some, clarification for others. Some following 'potential' spoiler-info is actually revealed on the DVD packaging. Some not. Feel free to skip to the last paragraph safely.)

At the end of episode 3 of ""TITMUSS REGAINED"" fail not to take close attention to the credits.  Our greatest laugh was embedded with those final rolling credits.",1252627200,19,6370,5.201368523949169

8345993,2,B001VB8U9U,"The story of an unscrupulous lower-class man who wants power in England.  The script shows some wit, and the series is almost worth the time.  But the soap runs freely, and the main character makes you want to hate him early on.  The clergy take their usual hit, the man in this case not believing a word of what he mouths.
