486659,2,6302538130,"I laugh when I see low-budget horror-science fiction films that feature actors who once starred in great classic movies.  ""Alone In The Dark"" is such a film.
A loony doctor(Donald Pleasence) runs a mental institution.  Three patients(Jack Palance, Martin Landau, Erland van Lidth) imagine that their psychiatrist(A pre-""A-Team"" Dwight Schultz) is planning to kill them, so during a blackout, the insane trio escape to seek out and kill him.
Jack (""Shane,"" ""Attack"") Palance, Martin (""North By Northwest"") Landau, and Donald (""The Great Escape"") Pleasence had all seen better days.  Landau gives a hammy performance that would make Rod Steiger blush.  He can be seen laughing and screaming hysterically and bulging his eyes throughout a good part of the film.  I find it hilarious that Landau once performed admirably with the magnificent Cary Grant in the four-star Alfred Hitchcock classic ""North By Northwest"" nearly a quarter-of-a-century earlier and was now starring in low-budget dreck like ""Alone In The Dark.""  Of course, Landau would redeem himself fourteen years later by earning an Oscar for ""Ed Wood.""  Likewise, Palance would later earn an Oscar for ""City Slickers.""
""Alone In The Dark"" is good for a few big laughs but nothing else.",994464000,2,1245,5.257575757575758

486720,3,6302538130,"At a secluded mental institution, Dr. Bain (Donald Pleasence) maintains order while electricity fuels the asylum's hi-tech security system that keeps the nearby neighborhoods safe from menaces like Frank Hawkes (Jack Palance) and ""Preacher"" (Martin Landau, Ed Wood).

Meanwhile a new doctor, Dan Potter (Dwight Schultz), arrives in town with his family, but the inmates don't take kindly to his presence and believe he has killed off their former therapist.

Suddenly a power outage leaves the town in chaos...and now the maniacs are free to roam the streets and hunt down the man they believe has invaded their lives. With the area quickly descending into riots and chaos, the innocent few must fight for their lives when they#re left terrified, cornered and Alone in the Dark!

One of the most memorable and terrifying cult horror films of the 1980s, this white-knuckle shocker from director Jack Sholder (The Hidden) features shocking special effects from Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead, Friday the 13th), delivering one seat-jumping scare after another along with a thick vein of sly, pitch-black humor. Turn off the lights and watch...if you dare!

This horror flick takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 10 years old in the 4th grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1982 when Ronald Reagan was the President and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1392163200,,1428,4.9375
486721,2,6302538130,"Well............given the stars involved I expected atleast mediocrity.  What I got was a very promising beginning, but shortly after the blackout (apparently bars are a big no-no in Donald Pleasance's revolutionary new asylum) the movie quickly fell apart.  I won't bother listing the post-blackout problems as they are very numerous.

I'd heard a lot of good things about this film.  I was quasi-disappointed, but am glad it's in my collection.",1388966400,,446,5.328571428571428
486722,3,6302538130,"First of all, mental hospital settings and the criminally insane hold the potential to be some of the creepiest material around. Here the hospital isn't made to be as freaky as it could have been, but the inmates? Brrrr. Part of it was how serious and dead pan they were, as well as played well. They certainly would have sent me running when the power went out!

The plot isn't anything fancy but for this kind of ride it doesn't need to be. When the power goes out and the inmates head out to kill the docs family...it gets interesting pretty fast. The movie isn't hurt by the fact they kill many along the way. As with other 80 flicks in its day, there are some kills that stand out and reek of fun.

As for the acting, pretty decent! This movie isn't good enough to have the cast it did, but needless to say, they helped it.

If you can create more unusual characters than the below, you deserve a gold star sticker:

1. Donald Pleasance as Dr. Bain, who is just as nutty as his patients. He talks a lot, using some bizarro treatments that would make the American Psychiatric Association cringe.

2. Jack Palance as Frank Hawkes, the leader of the group, stone wall serious and wacky as hell. His still demeanor and menacing face do all the work for him. If that weren't enough, whenever he slaughters somebody, he gets a nose bleed. (!)

3. Erland Van Lidth plays an overweight child molester and murderer...need I say more?

4. Martin Landau plays an overly religious pyromaniac who thinks he's a type of preacher. He enjoys going around killing people while quoting the good book.

Of course it's riddled with plot holes, and not much effort is used to make suspense happen. The inmates are creepy themselves, but no real eerie shots or tight moments. And of course, the way they escaped the asylum in the first place is completely ludicrous. Unfortunately, while it is violent, they stay lighter on the gore than they should have.

While cheap and cheesy, the great acting and some stand out kills make this 80's flick worth remembering. It would be nice when it is (if it is) released on DVD.",1379635200,,2101,4.507894736842105

486726,2,6302538130,"After reading many great reviews on this film,  I was excited to watch.  I am a child of the 80s and I LOVE a great horror film.  Having said that:  this film was filled with a cast to potentially make a great film.  This screenplay and execution just flopped.

What makes a great shrink in ""Halloween (1978)"" does NOT make a great shrink in this picture.  I suppose it would be difficult for any actor to utter some of the stupidity in this screenplay,  however.  ""Lila"" is a likeable character,  as is her mother ""Toni"" and ""Ray"" the orderly.  However,  the main players here are just laughable.  I do not understand why this film receives so much hype and so many great reviews.

I'm not saying do not watch it:  perhaps you'll be pleased,  as are so many in the horror community.  Alas,  if you're a fan of ""Friday The 13th (1980)"" or more well acted screenplays,  such as ""Halloween (1978)"",  ""The Amityville Horror (1979)"" or even great camp-horror like ""Chopping Mall""....You might be best served by renting or borrowing this one from your local library.

486727,2,6302538130,"The premise of this film is exciting...5 maniacs escape from the local mental hospital  and I think if this movie were re-made it could be pretty good. This is a slow paced early 80's slasher film. Good idea, poorly executed.",1323993600,,225,4.625
486728,4,6302538130,"In the few years preceding 1982, the slasher movie craze made these movies so commonplace and in some cases cookie cutter that by the tail end of the era, the form had gotten a little stale.  Therefore, you saw a few '82 entries in the genre that attempted to alleviate the familiarity of the material with touches of humor and satire.  Two relatively successful examples from that year included Amy Jones' ""Slumber Party Massacre"" along with Juan Piquer Simon's ""Pieces.""

Another film that always comes to mind in this regard is ""Alone in the Dark"" and it is one of the best of the slasher spoofs while at the same time being a perfectly acceptable terror/suspense flick itself.  It was an early release for New Line Cinema and the first film to feature the producing/directing team of Robert Shaye and Jack Sholder, respectively, who three years later would go on to make ""Nightmare on Elm Street 2.""

It concerns a power outage at a new age sanitarium that inadvertently releases four psychopaths, who proceed to lay siege to one of the new doctor's homes during the blackout, in something of an homage to Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead.""

""Alone in the Dark,"" though still a low budget film in most respects, had a slightly higher media profile and more prominent release than some movies of its ilk at the time, evidenced by the audience drawing potential of featuring Donald Pleasance (""Halloween"") as the pot smoking, hippie-leaning head psychiatrist of the institution, and Jack Palance and Martin Landau as two of the crazies who escape.

As for the social commenary/satire element, this one in many ways is like a time capsule to the early '80s, as the inherent evil of nuclear power is explored as a possible factor in the power blackout.  Also, the protagonists attend an all-out underground concert from a new wave punk band called the Sic F***s, who perform the touching ""Chop Up Your Mother,"" and the teens and other dregs in their fanbase at the show are portrayed as appropriately drugged out and socially maladjusted.

I viewed this one on a worn out old VHS copy long ago in the early '90s and I must say that seeing it on DVD again almost 20 years later was in many ways like seeing it for the first time.  Image Entertainment presents a pristine transfer that almost looks like it could have been shot yesterday save for a couple dated hairstyles, not to mention comprehensive liner notes from key horror genre authors, a still gallery and interviews with some key participants.  My only qualm as in a lot of DVD reissues is that the revamped cover art is kind of bland.  It's too bad they didn't include a reproduction of the superior original movie poster, such as Anchor Bay used to do.

All in all though, an excellent slasher thriller with some knowing social commentaries and a great cast to boot.  Still holds its own almost 30 years later.",1311379200,3,2873,4.708582834331337

Donald Pleasence is the head of a mental ward and the patients escape.  Sound familiar?  Unfortunately, Michael Myers is nowhere in sight.  The film just plods along while the viewer is unengaged.  Nothing interesting going on here.  Patients escape and kill a few people, but no suspense, no gore, the story isn't interesting, the characters aren't interesting and even the stars don't shine.  Jack Palance has a halfway amusing scene at the end, but it was the only scene that reminded me of why I like these actors.  A film not worth discovering, or rediscovering.

486732,4,6302538130,"A group of psychotics descend on the house of their new doctor and his family after convincing themselves he killed their old doctor and escaping the mental institute. AITD is a highly underrated and undermentioned slasher that offers excellent performances (including Donald Pleasance, Jack Palance, and Martin Landau!), an original plot, and many chilling scenes. The audience can readily empathize with the killers while fearing them, owing as much to the heavies as to the writing behind them. The scale is very small, with only a few select settings, but they are well crafted and create a sense of isolation and hopelessness. On top of that, the score is very subtle but extremely unsettling. There are some pacing issues, but they don't impede the film much. Favorite scene: Dr. Potter calls out to the psychotics, and the camera pans around the dimly lit swing set creaking in the dark, then to the empty trees, with the villains hidden off-screen. Highly recommended as one of New Line's earliest and strongest entries in the genre!

486780,2,6302538130,"Alone in the Dark (Jack Sholder, 1982)

The fact the over half of Alone in the Dark takes place in broad daylight should tell you most of what you need to know about this dog. It tries to be a cross between The Desperate Hours, Night of the Living Dead, and Straw Dogs, and manages to fail at imitating any of them with any sort of competence.

Dan Potter (Dwight Schultz) is the new doctor at Haven Hospital, run by the rather loose nut Leo Bain (Donald Pleasance). Bain is trying to cure violent offenders with just therapy in a hospital whose entire security system is electric. Then comes the inevitable blackout, and the escape of the four most violent felons in the place-- Byron the Preacher (Martin Landau), the arsonist; Ronald Elster (Stir Crazy's Erland van Lidth), the child molester; Skaggs, the Bleeder (character actor PhilipClark); and their leader, Frank Hawkes (Jack Palance). They know where Potter lives. You can guess the rest.

Alone in the Dark is notable for having, possibly, the largest plot hole in modern film (explain how a doctor doesn't recognize one of his patients for an entire day, if you'd be so kind). It is also noticeable for having two normally wonderful actors, Landau and Palance, give the worst performances either ever managed to come up with. As well, you have a script that lets four psychopaths loose on society-- a wonderful concept with which wonders can be done (viz. The Dream Team)-- and Sholder uses it just as a plot device. Come to think of it, he does that with just about every angle he could have used to give any depth whatsoever to this film. The end result can't even be called a mindless action flick; it doesn't have enough action. Some nifty special effects by Tom Savini and a fun soundtrack by the Sic F***s are about the only reasons you'd want to check this out. * ",1151452800,3,1833,4.613496932515337

486782,4,6302538130,"What can be scarier than being stuck Alone In The Dark with Martin Landau and Jack Palance?  This film attempts to answer that question and does a fine job.  I'm a huge nut for any B horror picture, and it's nice sometimes to actually see some real star power in them.  Granted, Landau and Palance weren't at the highest point in their careers when they did this.  The film has Dwight Schultz, who you may remember as Murdock in the A-Team, as a new therapist at an asylum run by Psychiatrist, Donald Pleasance(who smokes pot in his office).  ""The men on the 3rd floor"" are the extremely dangerous lunatics who decide to kill Murdock coz they believe he has murdered their former therapist.  There are 4 central killers-First is Marin Landau as ""Preacher"", a bible quoting psycho.  He's fantastic in this part.  Palance is the paranoid Vietnam vet named Hawkes, who is basically the ringleader.  He doesn't have alot of lines, but since it's Jack Palance, he's wonderfully creepy and convincing.  The third is played by Erland van Lidth as a child molester who is childlike himself.  You may remember Erland as the opera singing Roman Stalker in The Running Man(""Cut! Cut! Go to commercial!!"").  The fourth is rarely seen and this makes him interesting.  Since his face is always off camera, a name actor isn't necessary.  He's called The Bleeder, and comes off as the most dangerous of the 4 coz he doesn't speak and at one point pre-dates Jason Voorhees by wearing a hockey mask.  Donald Pleasance is awfully nutty and funny in his role of the doctor.  In fact, you start to wonder if he's actually a mental patient himself.  Schultz is decent as the straight man, a far cry from his Murdock character.  This film starts and builds up wonderfully.  It has a fantastic buildup to the point where it becomes like Night Of The Living Dead with Schultz and his family trapped inside their home during a blackout with the band of crazies outside.  Unfortunately the film falls kinda flat here.  With such a good buildup and collection of characters, you expect alot more out of this confrontation than you get.  It's actually kinda boring and not very intense at all.  Despite this shortcoming, the film is well worth watching for the performances.",1136505600,16,2245,4.729381443298969

One of the most cleaver films of the 1980's slasher craze. This film has an all-star cast, great acting, great and likable characters (even the kilelrs are likable) and a great all around atmosphere. The plot twist with ""The Bleeder"" was very cleaver and very well done. It took me by great surprise, but after watching the movie for a second time it seemed very obvious.

[the bad]

The movie really lacked bloody kills, but the film didn't really need it. I personally would have liked to see alot of blood, but the film would have worked even if there were no kills at all.

[final thoughts]

Like I said, one of the greatest movies of the 1980's slasher era and genre. The cast was great and in my opinion, the chemistry was perfect. Martin Landau was great, my favorite of the movie. His character reminded me of Drayton Sawyer in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Jack Palance played a very lovable and misunderstood paranoid schitzophrenic. Dwight Schultz was a perfect doctor and Donald Pleasence played himself as he was a ""weird"" psyciatrist (as in Halloween). I liked when ""The Bleeder"" donned a hockey mask and took afew people out, it may be mistaken that this was an homage to Friday The 13th when this movie was filmed before Friday The 13th Part 3, the movie in which Jason dons his trademark hockey mask for the first time. ""The Bleeder"" uses a small garden cultivator to take his victim, which was an exact scene from the slasher ""homage"" film Bloody Murder 2, a film which was based on (or in some people's opinion) outright stole ideas, scenes, kills, and cliches from popular slasher franchises. Steve Dash (credited as Steven Daskawisz) made a breif, but memorable appearance as a doctor who gets killed by the murderous gang. Steve Dash played Jason Voorhees in friday The 13th Part 2.

This movie is a must see for any fan of the horror genre. Martin Landau, Dwight Schultz, Jack Palance, Donald Pleasence and Steve Dash in the same movie? YES.",1136246400,7,1974,4.690751445086705

Some psychos imagine that their new psychiatrist killed the old one, so when there's a power outage (which we saw coming) they escape and lay siege to the psychiatrist and his family, who live in an isolated house in the woods.  Who will live, who will die?

Despite the strong cast (Donald Pleasance, Martin Landau, Jack Palance) it's a pretty pedestrian film.  Pleasance is the psychiatrist heading the institute (not the one hated by the escaped psychos).  He has loopy theories about letting insane people ""find their own space.""

Actually, another psychiatrist had that same theory in a much better film, a real horror gorefest called DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT.  And in THE BROOD, in which Oliver Reed's theories cause patients to physically manifest their mental ailments; a truly imaginative gorefest from Cronenberg.  Another superior horror film with this theme is ASYLUM, a British horror omnibus from Amicus.  Also consider SEIZURE, in which Jonathan Frid's family is likewise laid seige to in an isolated house by manifestations of Frid's insane mind.

ALONE IN THE DARK is tepid by comparison.  Not bad, but nothing special.  It lacks the visceral impact of those other films, and is also less imaginative.",1126828800,12,1262,5.043478260869565

While it does have many of the trappings of movies within that genre, escaped psychopaths, sharp implements of death, a big, old house, a family in terror, it doesn't really fit within the genre as it has some things a lot of those films didn't, like an interesting story, strong script, and a talented and experienced cast.  Co-written and directed by Jack Sholder (A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, The Hidden), the film features Jack Palance and Martin Landau, both of whom would later to go on to win Academy Awards for their roles in the films City Slickers (1991) and Ed Wood (1994), respectively.

After an entirely bizarre sequence that would make any male viewer cringe, we see Dr. Dan Potter (Schultz) arriving at a nut farm known as `The Haven'.  Apparently it's his first day, and he and his family have just recently re-located within the area so that Dan could accept the position.  Run by an oddball named Dr. Leo Bain (Pleasence), Haven isn't your typical loony bin, as the patients aren't called `patients', but voyagers, each `exploring their own space', as Bain would put it...yeah, ok...anyway, the Haven features pretty much your run-of-the-mill nuts, except for those housed on the third floor.  These are the more dangerous ones, kept in check by a sophisticated security system, which Bain objects to, but the state requires.  There's Frank Hawkes (Palance), a once POW, now fulltime psychotic schizophrenic, Byron Sutcliff (Landau) aka Preacher, a scripture quoting (Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord!), ex-minister who likes to set fires, a 400 pound child lover named Ronald Elster (van Lidth) aka Fatty, and Skaggs, a serial killer better known as `The Bleeder' because of his tendency to get nosebleeds prior to carving up his victims.  After their initial meeting with their new doctor (the previous one left to take another position), the boys on the third floor get it in their heads that Dr. Potter killed their old doctor, and now intends to kill them, so they decide to their only option is to kill him first...and soon get the chance as the sophisticated security system keeping them from escaping has one, major flaw...it only works if the electricity is on...and wouldn't you know it, the town suffers a blackout...oh yeah, the Haven's backup generator conks out (pretty convenient timing, if you ask me).  During the confusion, the boys grab themselves a car, hit the town, arm themselves at the local sporting goods store (looters are running rampant during the power outage), and then head over to the Potter residence...

I really did enjoy this film a lot, as it was the first movie I've seen in awhile that actually gave me the creeps, and created a good deal of real suspense.  I have to say, Martin Landau makes an extremely convincing psychopath, with his penetrating glares and huge, toothy, menacing grin.  He sold his character more than anyone else here, and left a lasting impression.  As far as Palance, I've always thought he be a little (okay, a lot) nuts, so playing a role like this probably wasn't much of a reach for him.  I thought he did well, but his screen time and character felt limited and lacking...I suppose this was to be expected, given the film features four homicidal maniacs.  Pleasence was a riot in his role as the unconventional, easy-going, eternally optimistic, touchy feely, weed smoking Dr. Bain...there's one scene, in particular, that highlights this...near the end, Dr, Bain shows up at Potter's house (the crazies have been terrorizing the family during the blackout), learns his `voyagers' are lurking about, and pleads with them to come out so they can `explore a few things together'.  The film has a handful of these comic moments that I enjoyed primarily because I have a sick sense of humor.  As far as Dwight Schultz, I thought he also did pretty well, and it must have been difficult playing against so many accomplished performers.  I did find his character to be a little annoying, the consummate clinician trying to apply his skills in a rational matter even during time of severe danger.  Eventually he does resort to his more primal instincts, ones that we all share.  I really got a strong sense of direction from this film, as tension is thick and almost always there, providing underlying aspect of uncertainty and uneasiness throughout, one of knowing at any moment, something nasty could happen...which is pretty interesting considering this is Sholder directorial debut, as normally one wouldn't expect someone to put a film together as well as he did, but I do believe he started out as an editor, so perhaps he developed an eye for how sequences should play out and fit together as a whole.  The pacing is strong, but really picks up after them men escape, and rarely slows down until the end.  There is a number of little surprises throughout, punctuated by a large one, which I managed to figure out well before it was presented...which, in turn, made me a little proud of myself as I didn't think it was entirely obvious, but, I suspect the average viewer will probably pick up on it as there are a few, well placed clues.  Regardless, even given what I suspected, the reveal was classic and worth waiting for...as far as the ending goes, it was definitely unexpected, but interesting.  Serious gore hounds may be disappointed by the lack of blood, but what this is in the movie is effective...one scene in particular features the brutal disposition of the ward attendant, played by Jennings, during the inmates escape.  All in all a creepy horror thriller, worth checking out if you're interested in something above and beyond the usual slasher picture.

I watched it because it mentioned a punk rock sister and I myself is a fan of punk rock. Cdnows description of Alone in the dark is really not the whole essence of the movie. The movie has so much going on that it scares you, it acctually scares you unlike the new ""horror"" movies which should be classified as ""scary"" movies, which only try to make you jump to increase your heart beat so you feel scared. But this film gits inside your skin and you feel like you are with all of them fighting to stay alive and wondering if life is worth all this pain. And let me be the first (maybe only) one to say I am pissed off at the hollywood movie ""ALONE IN THE DARK"" and the game ""ALONE IN THE DARK"" for making my life a living hell at finding information about the film. So go out there and see it if you can.

I have only seen this film once, but thats all i needed to have it be my favorite horror film.",1122163200,7,1048,3.9668246445497632

I like donald Pleasence, but him being in it didn't  really make the movie any more entertaining. . It did show some nudity, (the babysitter). In my opinion out of print or not I regret I paid 30 plus dollars. This is no knock on the seller, they were asking the going rate for this much, I just was expecting a better more entertaining movie Ps. I'm normally not nit picky about a movie entertaining me, but I just  lost interest in this movie about 30 minutes in. It's not scary or too suspenseful",1493251200,,627,4.191666666666666
7828094,4,6302538130,"Jack Palance and Martin Landau are a great combination in this 80's classic! A group of psychotics escape from a mental hospital, run by a lax psychiatrist, played by Donald Pleasance (of Halloween fame). They go after their new doctor, played by Dwight Schultz (of Star Trek: TNG, & the A-Team), hilarity and butchery ensues. I don't want to give away too much, but rest assured, if you have a free Saturday night, and some popcorn, this movie has something to offer almost everyone. In my opinion, the quality of the actors involved, elevates this movie out of the standard 80's horror fare, and into just a great thriller. It's not too bloody (but bloody enough), not too campy (but campy enough), it strikes the right balance, so that everyone will find something they like.

 If you are a fan of any of the quality actors in this film, then give this a viewing. YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED, even if it's just by watching Martin Landau, hiding in the bushes, cackling hysterically.

To the powers that be,  PLEASE REISSUE THIS ON DVD AGAIN! ! The current prices are ridiculous, and I know many a fan who wants this in their collection.",1478995200,,1135,4.6318407960199

7828096,4,6302538130,"Let me preface this review by saying I can't imagine why anyone would pay this much for a DVD even if it is out-of-print.  I found a copy on fleabay for less than half the price.  Now to the movie itself.  You have instant credibility in a film when you have the likes of such masterful actors as the great Donald Pleasance, Jack Palance and Martin Landau, so there's a win right out of the gate. I'd watch those 3 men read a cereal box and make fart jokes for 2 hours. Then toss in what I believe is one of our most underappreciated actors, Dwight Schultz, and you're on your way to a classic.  The movie is a perfect blend of what made these types of films so successful in their day, as well as revered classics now.  You have great actors, a good story and great atmosphere.  To me, you could have the best story in the world but if you cut corners on atmosphere and cheap actors, you just laid an expensive egg.  I love how AMAZINGLY scary Mr. Landau played his role as ""Preacher""and Mr. Palance could always easily scare the ever-loving hell out you and make you thank him for it.  Folks who cut their teeth on today's brand of horror and need to see hellish demonic possessions or a kill-a-minute computer generated gore fest may find something like this movie a little less than satisfying because it actually tells and builds a story, but the rest of us love this sort of stuff!  If you haven't seen this movie, you need to fix that.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  Sell a kidney or pimp out your wife at a truck stop and get your hands on a copy of this film for your next movie night.",1462147200,,1610,4.245901639344262
7828097,5,6302538130,"very under rated film with some very great superb actors, defintely worth getting or watching",1458172800,,93,5.266666666666667
7828098,5,6302538130,"OK.  If you're going to depend solely on electricity to keep the dangerous psychopaths from escaping your mental institute, you really need to have a wholly dependable backup system.  Unfortunately, the Havens backup system fails when the power goes out, which allows the dangerous guys on the third floor to escape (along with everyone else in the institute).  That is most unfortunate for Dr. Dan Potter (Dwight Schultz) because paranoid schizophrenic Frank Hawkes (Jack Palance) has convinced his buddies that Potter killed the previous doctor who was working with them.  That includes Byron Preacher Sutcliff (Martin Landau), who likes to cry out about the Lords vengeance while setting fires; Ronald Fatty Elster, a serial child molester; and The Bleeder, who has the embarrassing habit of suffering nosebleeds while hes committing murder and chooses never to show his face if at all possible.  Dr. Potter does have one guy in his corner, Dr. Leo Bain (Donald Pleasance)  but this version of Donald Pleasance actually thinks he can simply reason with the criminally insane.  Ultimately, its Dr. Potters whole family that finds itself alone in the dark with four unpredictable, psychopathic killers trying to get in the house.  That includes his wife, young daughter, and sister (who  wouldnt you just know it  has a lifelong fear of the dark).

Few horror thrillers can boast of such a stellar cast as that of Alone in the Dark.  Martin Landau, Jack Palance, and Donald Pleasance have a presence that none of todays actors can even begin to match.  Schulz was pretty much a lightweight compared to the three big names in this film, but he acquitted himself quite well.  Palance and Landau steal the show, though  as you would expect.  As for the storyline, it isn't all that original overall, but I have to give major props to the writers for introducing one major plot twist I didn't see coming.  I didn't fine the film scary at all, but there are some uneasy moments involving Potters little girl and one jump-scare that is pretty effective.

I would highly recommend this film to fans of horror and suspense.  Just look at the cast list, for crying out loud.  Who wouldnt enjoy watching Jack Palance and Martin Landau get in touch with their psychotic sides?",1442620800,2,2266,4.928759894459103
7828099,5,6302538130,"There's a certain UNIQUE quality about this slasher film from 1982. What can be said about a slasher film starring such amazing actors as
 Donald Pleasance, Martin Landau and Jack Palance. As well, Erland Van Lidth, is a standout in this film also! The premise is a good one...although with a few changes here and there, this could have been a genre CLASSIC!
However, it's still an interesting slasher film with great acting from it's cast members!
As far as slasher films go, I'd recommend it! There is little gore in this film. It relies more on atmosphere and good acting!
This movie delves into the depravity of man and reminds us that depending upon the situation...we are are capable of killing!
It's similar in subject matter to that of the film, 'Straw Dogs.' However, I prefer this film over that one. This movie displays a 'sense of humor' in various places and doesn't take itself too seriously. After viewing this movie three (3) times, it seems it has gotten better each time I've watched it!
It's also of note that this movie apparently infuenced other slasher films. The character, 'The Bleeder,' wears a hockey mask...and additionally, his nose bleeds when he kills! Jason Voorhies would later don a hockey mask in the Friday the 13th series. And although Friday the !3th Part 3 was released before this film was...this movie was filmed before that one was!
In the slasher film, Valentine,' the idea of the 'bloody nose' was a trademark of the killer!
So, with all that being said, this movie comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by me as one of the best slasher films of the 80s!
Check it out if you enjoy slasher films!",1430784000,,1625,4.701754385964913
7828100,3,6302538130,"Some people erroneously call this gem a slasher. It's not. It's about 4 mental patients who escape a hospital during a blackout to terrorize the family of their new doctor. This film attempts to take elements from the slasher genre but ultimately is a tame representation of 80's horror. There are a few good jump scares (Toni's apparition as created by the great Tom Savini), but all in all this isn't the most frightening horror flick. The terror is subdued in favor of a smart story. Very good though. Notable as another film where Donald Pleasence plays a mental health professional.",1392422400,,587,4.821782178217822
