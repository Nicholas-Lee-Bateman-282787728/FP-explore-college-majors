2336621,2,B0009Y272Q,"This DVD is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show.  For a ""best of"" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely ""the best of"" and the ""scariest moments.""  In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises.  I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer.  About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).  Even though the DVD is fairly inexpensive, I don't think it's worth the cost.",1144281600,25,637,4.552631578947368

2336623,1,B0009Y272Q,"As a Ghost Hunters fan I loved the First Season Dvd.  This ""Best of Ghost Hunters"" Dvd was just recycling previous (inconclusive for the most part!) shows - certainly not anything new or exciting at all.  The previously deleted footage should have stayed that way!  Don't waste your money on this Dvd.  Buy the First Season and look for the Penitentiary and the Lighthouse episodes.",1141689600,41,382,4.8307692307692305
2336624,2,B0009Y272Q,"Foremost, the episodes that they picked weren't all good (certainly not the ""The Very Best.."").

Second, the general editing was poorly done. Third, the extra footage featuring parts of interviews previously cut out, should have never been put back in. The footage was boring and a waste of time. All, I can say is this tape is dissapointing.  Don't bother to buy it.",1138233600,23,367,4.809523809523809
2336625,5,B0009Y272Q,"hi there my fellow ghosthunter's fans, I have to say that Ghosthunter's Rock. I thought the packaging and the DVD itself was excellent! although, there were a minor 15 to 20 mintue gap inbetween one of the investgations or hearing the announcer saying on the next time on ghosthunters, I cant complained i love it inspite of that,",1135728000,2,330,4.706896551724138
2336626,5,B0009Y272Q,This is one of the best series from Scifi since day one of scifi channel.. This series is a keeper and love the episodes.  A couple are dissappointing episodes but all and all great! A+++ All around! And 10 times better then Most Haunted!,1134000000,2,238,4.409090909090909
2336627,5,B0009Y272Q,I love the show and love the box set.  But for people who just want to see some of the best moments and fav episodes...This DVD is fantastic!  You get over 2 hours of content for less than 10 bucks!!!,1128556800,,200,3.975
2336667,1,B0009Y272Q,"Okay, I'm an idiot. I bought the seasons and then later bought this thinking it might be different. Just a replay of earlier episodes.

2336668,4,B0009Y272Q,"I have always liked Ghosthunters,this set of episodes is sort of like the icing on the cake. Thank You. TJW",1368144000,,107,4.4
2336669,1,B0009Y272Q,"can't believe I bought this , waist of time and money . all fake , a real shame. should just toss it in the trash",1358553600,,113,3.56
2336670,3,B0009Y272Q,"this video shows how the guys started taps while operating a roto rooter company. You get to see them doing plumbing.  Interesting cases, but poor quality editing, and Jason is  arguing with his helpers... The lips of the person speaking do not match the words they are speaking at times.. a behind the scenes view, almost seems like a promo film at times... I am  just going to order the whole season because I enjoy the episodes better than this video.",1338163200,8,454,4.580246913580247
2336671,2,B0009Y272Q,"OK,there was three episodes here! And they were ok,but Ive seen a lot of there shows that was a lot better! See the thing is,I liked that they brought a little of their family life into it,but Jasons wife,is she even ok with him being a ghost hunter at all! As far as when I wnet to sleep I dreamed about Jason,surprised the heck out of me,won't tell that dream,his wife would not like what I dreamed! but it needed more excitement,the little girl actually talking to them would of been really cool!",1298505600,,499,4.376344086021505
2336672,1,B0009Y272Q,"This is simply the 1st 2 episodes of season 1, buy the 1st season instead and get better value.",1271635200,,95,4.052631578947368
2336673,3,B0009Y272Q,"It's filled with curiosity-provoking scenes. However, all the evidences shown in the DVD are unconclusive. The hunters can't prove without doubt that there ghosts. It's still worth watching once.",1228608000,,195,5.758620689655173
2336674,5,B0009Y272Q,AWESOME PRODUCT. ARRIVED IN NEW SHAPE AND VERY PLEASED HOW FAST IT SHOWED UP. WE HAVE WATCHED IT ABOUT OVER TWENTY TIMES. THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME SALE. I AM A GHOSTHUNTERS FANATIC.,1228003200,,182,4.545454545454546
2336675,5,B0009Y272Q,Well now these shows are right up my alley! I love Grant and Jaye alot and these guys have made ghost hunting fun but also turned the whole thing into a science with all their gadgetry and very awesome take on the ghost world. Jay and Grant are both very charasmatic as is the team they put together each show to hunt the ghosts. I really highly recommend any Sci-fi Ghost Hunter shows that you haven't yet seen on Sci-fi.,1215043200,,422,4.2875
2336676,5,B0009Y272Q,"When I ordered the DVD, it came much quicker than I had anticipated.  I've watched it more than several times and now my sister-in-law is watching it repeatedly as well.  The ease of ordering through AMAZON was super and I'd recommend AMAZON.Com to everyone.
Thank you

2336701,2,B0009Y272Q,"I can only agree with the previous reviewers that these ""Best Of..."" DVDs are nothing more than randomly selected and ultimately uninteresting segments (FAR from being the best). They even contain the bleeps and commercial fade-outs and recaps.

The bonus interview was a flat dud and the ""deleted"" scenes were simply longer re-takes and raw footage of stuff you've already seen in the episode. Cutting-room floor stuff, nothing at all worth looking at or listening to.

Do not waste you money! Just buy the complete season(s) and you'll come out much farther ahead.

Couldn't give it zero stars, so I gave it one star for Grant and one for Brian.",1204761600,,647,4.863636363636363
2336702,1,B0009Y272Q,"This review isn't a commentary on the show itself.  I love the show, but this ""very best"" is a complete rip off.  My husband and I are really into the show and were looking forward to seeing a complilation of the ""very best"" of Ghost Hunters.  Instead what we got was the exact same disc as the first disc of season 1.  I rented the two of them at the same time, and they are exactly the same thing. I had to keep checking to make sure I didn't put the wrong disc in. Very disappointing.",1203724800,,487,4.041666666666667
2336703,5,B0009Y272Q,I'm a huge Ghost Hunters fan and was thrilled to get the chance to meet the guys back in November. This was just a great addition to me collection! Really cool to see all the out-takes.,1199145600,,185,4.166666666666667
2336704,4,B0009Y272Q,"Ghost hunters: the very best of... well I have to say that I bought this DVD out of curiosity and I have to say that it was great! Now I am thinking of buying the first season, I would recommend this if you are like me, that means, if you know nothing about the tv show and its your first incursion with the series, this way you can see if you like it or not, otherwise I recommend you go directly for the seasons.

On the other hand I have to say it is a very good show (a real one), but I am not so sure about ""the very best of""... because in some of the teasers about ""the next program"" I could tell that they looked more interesting than some of the shows included in this DVD, so that's why I am not sure if the title of the DVD makes justice to all its content... I wanted to see the episode (included in one teaser) of the theater; that one you could tell was a scary one, but sadly it wasn't included in this DVD although it was advertised in a previous show.",1185494400,2,967,3.933673469387755
2336705,5,B0009Y272Q,I love the show and I miss it during the 'off season' so this was a great way to catch good investigations I may have missed or re-watch my favorites.,1168300800,,150,4.033333333333333
2336706,1,B0009Y272Q,"These guy's are the best I've ever seen. If you can handle the truth, then this DVD is for you. They don't say every little thing that happens is real. They check every detail. I give this set a five star rating.",1167868800,,212,4.071428571428571
2336707,2,B0009Y272Q,"This dvd purports to be the ""very best of"" this series, but it is anything but.  First off, the first fifteen minutes or so has little to do with in the way ghost hunting, rather ""introduces"" the various persons involved with TAPS and is in fact quite boring.  I couldn't care less that these guys are plumbers and have wives that are pissed off with their preoccupation with the paranormal.  When we finally get around to the various investigations they turn out to be quite mundane and at times frustrating to watch because of the apparent amateurishness of the investigators.  If these guys have been doing this for as long as they claim, it certainly doesn't seem like it.  And in the end, despite the claim in the blurb on the gack of the dvd case that watching these episodes would convince one that ghosts really do exist, they certainly don't.  Sadly, the two episodes that seemed somewhat promising are not included in the dvd, although they are mentioned briefly in the ""in the next episode"" segment of two of the episodes.  What's more, in the five minute bonus feature in which two of the investigators discuss their favorite episodes, both the lighthouse and penitentiary investigations are agree upon as being favorites, while--if I remember correctly--only two of the fore included in this video are mentioned, and not with much enthusiasm.  I just can't recommend this dvd.",1166745600,5,1389,4.831223628691983
2336708,5,B0009Y272Q,The Team on ghostbusters is the best and you will love this DVD.,1162598400,,64,4.0
2336709,3,B0009Y272Q,"I love Ghost Hunters, so no episode is a bad episode to me, but I think the title of this DVD is a little off track.  During Season one there were other shows which were far more interesting than the few that are included here.  The DVD is also poorly edited, lending to large gaps of nothing inserted where the commercials would have been.  If you really want the best of Ghost Hunters I suggest you invest in the complete first season.  Jason and Grant ROCK!  Unfortunately, this DVD does not.",1152576000,6,495,4.395604395604396
2336710,1,B0009Y272Q,"I also found this ""Best of"" collection to fall very short of the ""BEST""! There are clearly MANY other episodes they could have, and SHOULD HAVE used and included to make this truly a ""Best of"" feature. The few cases they did showcase were by far NOT the scariest! A definite disappointment,...though still a fan!!",1151971200,8,313,4.709090909090909
8070002,3,B0009Y272Q,So far two shows are in there twice. Course the show them selves are cool,1500940800,,73,3.933333333333333

8070004,1,B0009Y272Q,There are so many better episodes of this show this was definitely not the best of the Ghost Hunters. Not worth the money at all.,1468108800,2,129,4.2
8070005,5,B0009Y272Q,mom bought and and loved it,1467676800,,27,3.6666666666666665
8070006,2,B0009Y272Q,Don't get me wrong I love the show but the quality of these videos are lackluster which doesn't bother me too much but did require me to knock it down one star from my initial rating. However what makes me knock this down even more is the fact that after mid-way through the audio/video will go out of sync. I first thought it was my PS4 so I tried it on PC (i7 3770k / 16GB 1800+ RAM/GTX 970 4GB GPU) and... it still happened in same spots.,1443657600,2,441,4.0227272727272725
8070007,1,B0009Y272Q,"Love the show but this and the other volumes on amazon don't give you any idea what you getting, which episodes.  And most of this was excerpts  I was not pleased at all.  Not even good episodes!!",1441843200,2,196,4.243243243243243
8070008,1,B0009Y272Q,Not worth the price.,1441152000,,20,4.25
8070009,1,B0009Y272Q,"This is junk.  Very poor editing, tons of duplicate footage.  Spending time on cases with no evidence.  Deleted scenes that were not worth getting on the air originally but used as filler here.  A boring waste of time and money.",1430179200,,228,4.625
8070010,2,B0009Y272Q,For most of the movie the audio was out of sync.  Thats so annoying. Most of the footage seemed fuzzy also. Kinda wish I woulda saved my money. To tell ya the truth the best part of the show was watching the guys plumb.,1426464000,,219,3.977272727272727
8070011,5,B0009Y272Q,I don't think they ever saw a ghost but for some reason I find these folks entertaining.,1408147200,,88,4.235294117647059
