8464477,5,B005BXY1OM,"Both my 4 year old son and my 2 year old daughter love Scooby Doo. They watch some of the movies, as well as episodes from the 1960s/1970s series. Initially, I wasn't sure if the Pup Named Scooby Doo series would be too ""babyish"" for them, but they LOVE it. It is not at all scary, but very cute and funny. For example, in each episode during the chase scene everyone stops to dance - including the monster. It's definitely a fun little show and my kids really get a kick out of it.",1362960000,,482,4.138297872340425
