2831170,5,B000Q66G3S,"I agree with the other customers' reviews: this dvd is really fantastic! Ihave got many instructional dvds and I can say that ""Sensual bellydance"" is one of my favourite. In particular I appreciate the fluid and sensual choreography and the sensual poses! I highly recommend it for dancers of all levels!",1193443200,2,304,4.980392156862745
2831171,5,B000Q66G3S,"Here comes World Dance New York with yet another great program to enrich your dance life.
This time it's Blanca telling her story of sensual belly dance with a body language you will immediately want to learn.
I have to say, I have viewed this program many times before writng this review. It is my absolute favorite! The program is captivating from beginning to end. Blanca is almost sultry, soft voiced and beautifully accented. That is just the entrance to the enchanting world of  sensual belly dance. Effortlessy,drift into a languid,flowing, mesmerizing move to the next-Blanca style. I tried hard to fly from Texas to NYC for her workshop but was unable to, and this program came to me all in perfect time.
The setting is perfect,in soft hues and enhancing Blanca in a beautiful red backdrop. Blanca is sensual, graceful as a ballerina in a wonderland! The instruction is presented as dance itself, from an experienced and confident, instructor with passion.
The warm up is set for sensual belly dance in a flow style. Every stretch, pose, is explained in detail as you follow along at moderate pace. Learn angles that corellate to head movements,beautiful sensual arms, hands, footwork,layering, shimmies.

The choreography is intermediate, very elegant, none threatening and easy to learn with a comprehensive breakdown; upper body, footwork, and lower body practice included. Here you reward yourself with the sensuality of movement offered by this beautiful style. You will want to learn this even if just to watch yourself flow in the mirror. The music will charm you in.
In summary, the program takes you deep into technique elaborating in  progressions,flow,steps shimmies,turns,hip articulations,connectives, sensual poses, and a cool down. I benefitted much from the arm and hand movements, poses that will embellish my personal style of belly dance.
Performances by Blanca leave you spell bound. She is a fabulous dancer!!There is approximately 2 hours of instruction and practice included.

In a library of over 400 dance videos,, this is one of my top belly dance instructional videos. This program is rich in content, with many prisms of beauty that create the one dance that I love, belly dance.
I will look forward to anything else Blanca presents. If you are a beginner, I would defintiely begin with basics and quickly add this program to the basics. I believe this program is a good foundation, with beauty,class,grace and will define your style quickly.
Definitely a must-have for the serious dancer. In my book, 10 stars!!!",1193184000,6,2550,5.122596153846154
2831172,5,B000Q66G3S,"Looking like Botticelli's ""Venus on the Half Shell"" on the cover, and dancing like a goddess throughout this fantastic DVD, Blanca is not only a wonderful performer, but also one of the most thorough, perceptive teachers I've seen on a dance instruction DVD. This is an extensive and detailed program of bellydance techniques, with fluid style and lovely choreography. You will be using this DVD a lot, and dancers on many levels of training will be able to benefit from it, from beginners, to intermediate and beyond. There is much to learn here for everyone.

After the ""Welcome,"" you get a technique breakdown of the steps, followed by 40 minutes of Flow Warmups, which can be practiced with the verbal explanation or just followed with music only. This ""Flow"" section would be a great substitute for those who regularly do yoga or Pilates, and would like a change of pace, as they are excellent for exercise as well as being aesthetically pleasing to do, and promote flexibility and strength without stress. The production is excellent, and total running time of the entire DVD is 120 minutes, and you are sure to enjoy all of it.

Born in Mexico, Blanca has a soft accented voice and is articulate in how she shares her technique and ideas about bellydancing, some of which could be helpful in many other genres of dance. Blanca's style is unique and incredibly graceful, and she also exudes a sweet spirit, taking her dancing to another level we will sense in our own souls. The final 2 tracks are of Blanca performing, and are exceedingly beautiful, and make a marvelous end to a superb dance instruction DVD.",1193184000,64,1616,4.788530465949821
2831173,5,B000Q66G3S,"I LOVE the fact that Blanca has an intermediate portion.  Most of the instructional DVD's that I've purchased all focus on the basics, so this is great! She also has an excellent teaching style, having the ability to be meticulous, yet gives easy to follow articulate instructions, instead of overly complicating them.

The performances, musical selections and costumes are beautiful and her demeanor is very calming. As another reviewer also stated, she isn't perky with a phony smile permanently fixed on her face.  This DVD will get plenty of play in my house!",1192406400,5,563,5.032258064516129
2831174,5,B000Q66G3S,"I had the Chance to take her workshop in New york City, what she does is amazing, you can see her soul, is a natural gift, she is beautiful sensual and loving person, her dance is a delighful experience, this DVD offer more than instructional video, gives you inspiration to look, feel a performe like her, Bravo Blanca.",1191888000,4,320,4.5344827586206895
2831175,5,B000Q66G3S,"What a treasure!!! I have many, many belly dance instructional dvds but this has to be one of the best and well worth what I paid for it. Bravo to World Dance New York for producing another fantastic, nearly two hour long dvd for such a reasonable price.
I am so glad that Blanca chose this aspect of bellydance to teach as the slower, more sensual moves of Middle Eastern dance are often overlooked on instructional dvds. She has a very gentle voice and is soothing to listen to. I also like her demeanor. You never get the sense that she is condescending to the viewer and, thank Heaven, she doesn't resort to making those annoying repetitive extortions to ""Keep up the good work"" or  - worst of all -""Come you! You can do it, I know you can!""
The performances by Blanca are mesmerizing. Her movements are very fluid and she seems to be connected to the music at a physical level. She is the embodiment of sensuality.
I've only scratched the surface of what this dvd has to offer but I know it is going to be my number one practice companion for a long time to come.
Well done, Blanca and World Dance New York!!!!!",1191628800,21,1116,4.365384615384615
2831176,5,B000Q66G3S,"I just got this the other day, bought it more or less on a whim, but what a great deal. Quick FYI: The info said it was 60 minutes, but it's actually 2 hours of dance/instruction.
Blanca is very pretty, very serene, with a soft accent, which sounds very soothing. She's not perky with a huge grin splitting her face in two and she's not all bouncy and bubbly, none of that instant best friend vibe, just pleasant and serene.
It's a sensual dance instruction and she wears her part very well. The settings are very nice, not distracting, and she wears great costumes for teaching (you can see her legs when she does the moves). You can also see her perform the dances in full costume and she's very lovely to watch.
My husband really liked the music and the dance style for its sensuality and slow, languid movements. I watched one of the dances first and thought, 'wow, I'd like to move like her.' She moves like liquid, like silk, whatever elegant, graceful, flowing metaphor you want.
Instructionwise, she breaks everything down very well, from snake arms, using a lot of descriptive terms (like your arms are moving through honey, is one example), hip circles, figure 8's, and so on. Then she builds on these initial, isolated movements, and you learn more layers, combinations, steps, and build on and on. She even explains alignment, how to align your head, for example, to look more graceful. It's a bit like the Jillina dance instruction dvds, in how she gives you the basics and you build on and on until you are doing a choreographed dance. And of course you can skip and just do the basics or dance along with her, or just watch Blanca, which is what I want to do in addition to learning to dance like her.
The music is very nice too and the dances are slow and languid, nothing super fast, but your muscles will feel it nonetheless. It would be fine for beginner dancers or for intermediates. She doesn't spend a huge amount of time on each move, so you do get a lot for 2 hours, but you can always rewind 15 or 30 seconds and review.
I've got 20 to 30 bellydance dvds and vhs tapes at home and while I've seen and worked out to a lot: Mara, Jillina, Bellytwins, Kathy Smith (just that one), Bellyqueen, Bellydance Superstars, Suhaila, East Coast Tribal, American Tribal and more, I still am very happy with the dvd. It's shot a good angles (not distracting or only focused on the abs), the production is very good, and it's a nice focus on flowing dance. It's not something you pop in to learn a couple moves for the club, but a lovely sensual routine to stretch and dance to. Venus is the right name because it is very sensual and elegant and beautiful.",1191628800,173,2666,4.465163934426229
2831204,5,B000Q66G3S,"Good dvd for a beginner like my wife. She really likes it, its fun, and also can be used as an exercise.",1402531200,,104,3.772727272727273

2831206,5,B000Q66G3S,"I agree with everything Basbenee said about this video and the instructor.
Some of the low-rating reviewers must not have watched. Carefully. The Techniques section explained how to correlate your arm movements with the silk scarf flowing. She also demonstrated princess arms, and other terms.
I was satisfied with this purchase.",1388880000,,329,5.470588235294118
2831207,5,B000Q66G3S,Very exotic and love watching.  Let a friend borrow it and she also likes it and did not hurry to return it.,1386979200,,108,3.909090909090909
2831208,4,B000Q66G3S,"This is a good DVD with the instructor carefully explaining the skills. It is a good review for advanced dancers, but also simple enough for the beginner. She does warm-ups and individual skills, as well as combining them into routines.",1386547200,,236,4.925

2831210,5,B000Q66G3S,"Blanca takes belly dancing up a notch. She explains every step and movement, you can see her legs and feet, which help alot, shows graceful hand and arm movements. It's like you are in her class and you are her only student. The only problem I had was in some sections the music was louder then her voice, but if you watch it acouple times you know what she is trying to teach you. There are a couple sections where she is in her beautiful costumes and does a routine and when you watch it, you just want to move like her, graceful, fluid, smoothe and sensual.",1363046400,,560,4.242990654205608
2831211,5,B000Q66G3S,This is a fantastic dvd for anyone that loves sensual Belly Dance. Blanca is soooo good at it! She is easy to follow and a true pleasure to watch. A must have!,1362355200,,159,4.0
2831212,2,B000Q66G3S,"I don't know where this dvd is getting all the good reveiews from. Weird outfits, weird music, boring dancing. The accent is hard to understand. A long, touchy-feely intro with scarves floating in the wind over an ocean cliff. I watched this once, and sent it back.",1357516800,,265,4.659574468085107
2831213,5,B000Q66G3S,"This is a beautiful art.  This DVD will help you to be more aware of life's beautiful patterns in movement.  The accompanying music is also very strong, sensual, erotic and romantic.  The sights and sounds  are rich,  powerful, thought provoking and spellbinding.",1356652800,,263,5.166666666666667
2831214,4,B000Q66G3S,"I do happen to really like this video.  Blanca is a beautiful dancer. Actually I have to say my favorite.  She is the epitome of sensual.  She choreographs a very beautiful dance.  Her arm movements are truly exquisite.  Even her warm up you feel like you are dancing a sensual dance. It really does take alot of practice though to achieve to her level.  Believe me, I videoed myself after practicing her choreography and had to laugh.  My video reminded me I'm still very much a beginner.  All the more reason to practice.

I do have to mention that I wasn't impressed very much with the practice sessions. She does a full costumed demo, then she goes thru it with voice cues.  Its a little fast. Then she does a practice with your lower half of your body, and then one with your upper half of your body.  I didn't find these to be very helpful. A little more practice sessions on the whole dance with your whole body, would have been better.  Neon has a Sensual Goddess for beginners out, that is actually structured alot better.  Neon is a great teacher, and she really breaks it down better than Blanca.  That doesnt mean you shouldnt buy this dvd. You can't learn to dance sensually anywhere else better than watching Blanca.

I wouldn't recommend this to absolute beginners. You would get overwhelmed.  It is not easy to dance like her, but If youve been taking lessons for a little while at least, Blanca can help you to get the grace you need and have alot of fun doing it.",1350000000,3,1481,4.449814126394052
2831215,5,B000Q66G3S,"This was purchased as a gift. I cannot claim to know the efficacy of the routine on the dvd, but I can definitely attest to the results re: increased confidence, sensuality and all-around good times to be had by all. Give it a shot.",1334188800,,232,4.295454545454546
2831216,5,B000Q66G3S,I am new to bellydancing and i think this dvd is great.  She has a section to learn all the moves but you can skip the section in the menu.  She has a section where she talks you thru a dance and a free dance section where she dances but does not instruct you (I haven't made it there yet). I would highly recommend this DVD.,1331164800,,325,3.909090909090909
2831217,3,B000Q66G3S,"Perhaps I should not have viewed this after seeing Sarah Skinner in action. At any rate, at first I found Blanca's approach grating. The whole ""welcome"" section in which she describes what sensuality is just got on my nerves. I would have rather seen her dance her interpretation of ""sensual"" than hear her talk about it. Eventually I adjusted to her style, but I do wish she would take some advice from Sarah Skinner on how to make practice outfits that are flattering to her figure. She was wearing some sort of hip scarf that made her look short and elfish in nearly every section. If she doesn't know how to pick practice outfits, she should just stick with the professional dance costumes she wore in the other sections. Your appearance makes a huge difference in how you present yourself as a dance instructor. However, the DVD does have some nice choreography and if you don't have high expectations, it is acceptable. P.S. Actually, my expectations were a bit high based on the title. With a title like ""Sensual Belly Dance,"" the DVD really ought to offer more on how to choose and/or make costumes to enhance your dancing. Blanca could have had Sarah Skinner guest star for that section. It really would have helped round out the video. Plus, as I said earlier, if you're going to teach sensual dancing, you ought not to wear outfits that make you look like a little lost elf running around stage.",1327363200,,1406,4.650602409638554
2831218,5,B000Q66G3S,"Blanca is such an amazing instructor.... she helps with balance, grace, and brings out the sensual nature of bellydancing! She is so graceful and uses moves that are very slow to really work all your leg and abdominal muscles! This is an awesome workout!",1313280000,,254,4.795454545454546
2831219,2,B000Q66G3S,"Lots to learn from on this DVD but I just can't get past the music.  I know people perform belly dance to other kinds of music than arabic, but I just can't listen to the stuff on this DVD for 2 hours.  I have had the same problem with another belly dance DVD (Neon) from World Dance New York.  Part of the beauty of learning a form of world dance is being able to listen to the music of the countries from which the dance originates. I also don't like the goddess stuff that World Dance puts in it's dvd's.",1312934400,3,507,4.05
2831220,5,B000Q66G3S,"I bought this DVD after searching online for basic instructional in order to keep current with basic belly dance drills and exercises.  Blanca speaks with a soft voice that is comforting and she gives ""examples"" of how steps or moves should be, for example, ""caress"", and ""drawing on water"".  The basics are broken down into upper and lower body and are integrated together for easy understanding.  Also, the choreography is more than lovely, and the steps are provided for you in combinations, which is excellent rather than watching a dance and having to stop/start every few seconds to get the feel of the steps and count of the music.

I highly recommend for beginner as well as advanced.  *The music is really great and credits are given at the end so you can find them online for downloading.",1305849600,5,798,4.753623188405797
2831221,5,B000Q66G3S,"I am very happy with this video. I've done belly dancing in the past but with three kids at home find it hard to take any classes. This video is exactly what I've been looking for and is mcuh better than I expected. I really appreciate that she broke everything down so well and made it very easy to follow. She explains everything in an easy to understand way. The choreography is beautiful and really makes one feel beautiful while dancing. The ""flow"" section can be used as a workout on its own or just to help practice.",1302739200,,523,4.346938775510204
2831222,5,B000Q66G3S,"I've only done this one twice, but it is my favorite bellydance workout.  The others assume you already know the moves and are confident in performing them at a rapid pace.  Great for a seasoned enthusiast, but confusing for a beginnner.  I love Blanca's voice, it's calm and soothing.  The descriptions she gives as to how movement is performed, what it should feel like and how to hold yourself are very descriptive.",1301356800,,418,4.763888888888889
2831223,5,B000Q66G3S,"This DVD is a must for your Bellydance instructional library.
Blanca approaches bellydancing from a very internal meditative way. She calls it Sensual, it focuses on being in the moment with your body and feelings.
She has a languid, graceful,  not forced technique specific style.
However, If I were a beginner I would start with Bellydance 101 with Amira which beautifully covers the basic body mechanics of a movement.
Then I would move on to this DVD -
Sensual Belly dance with Blanca puts moves together fluidly. Belly dance is all about isolated movement, which are challenging. Blanca puts head, arms, legs all together so you look graceful doing the move and really feel like a bellydancer!

While is was very lovely to look at, it was kind of hard to follow. It seemed more for someone who already had the basics down. The lady went kinda fast and just breezed through the movements. All in all I wouldnt say it's good for beginners. I kinda wish I could return it.",1274140800,5,423,4.108433734939759
2831266,5,B000Q66G3S,"Blanca does it again in another video from World Dance New York with her instructional DVD Sensual Bellydance. This is ideal for those who want to enjoy their body in a whole new way while getting in shape and learning both new and old belly dancing moves. Unlike some intermediate level belly dance videos, Sensual Bellydance is accessible for beginners with absolutely no experience in the art.

Blanca is definitely a likable instructor, and has a sincere warmth about her. She opens the beginning of the video reminding people that sensuality comes from within, and to enjoy the basics of life such as nature. Her instructional style is easy to follow, and though she has a soft Spanish accent it does not interfere with one's ability to clearly understand her directions. Blanca is also encouraging, and moves through the material at a pace good for beginners to belly dancing.

2831295,5,B000Q66G3S,"Let me say at the outset that I love this DVD. Blanca's style of dance is a welcome relief from the more athletic styles that seem to be in vogue at the moment and much more representative of my personal dance preferences.  I really, REALLY wish that she would make more instructional videos.  Long ones.  Perhaps a set... [Blanca, this is a HINT!]
The only problem? I absolutely LOVE the song ""Ifrit"" to which Blanca performs the Venus choreography variation with floorwork. The song is credited to Tim Rayborn's album The Flame and the Shadow. I would love to put that piece on my iPod and practice to it for hours but I can't because the song on the DVD is completely different from the one on the album. I know because I GOT the album expecting the song to be there. There IS a song titled ""Ifrit"" on the album but it isn't the one that is on the DVD. I've searched high and low and I can't find this song anywhere but on the DVD so if you fall in love with it as I have and you want to dance to it, you're going to have to have a DVD player handy and if you want to make it part of a dance ""suite"" you are going to be out of luck. Other than that disappointment, this DVD is pure delight and I hope that at some point, the version of ""Ifrit"" on the DVD will be made available for fanatics like me to download.",1241740800,,1314,4.0852713178294575

2831299,3,B000Q66G3S,"The one thing that saved ""Sensual Bellydance"" is how highly excited I am to be learning belly dance again. And while all of the moves were sexy and fun, I found the instruction to be a bit vague and rushed. As a matter of fact, it convinced me to go out and sign up for an in-person belly dance class instead of relying on generalized and impersonal DVD sets. This bothers me only because I bought this DVD hoping it would accommodate beginners. I took a few belly dancing classes a couple of years back but have not practiced since and thus consider myself a re-beginner.

I felt that Blanca did not focus on explanations of moves. She kind of expected the watcher to just know what she is talking about most of the time when it came to how the hips should feel and posture.

It was also confusing when, in the middle of new moves, the DVD would change to another scene which would show Blanca waving a scarf through the air to demonstrate how my hands should flow, or something similar. One problem with that: my hand isn't a scarf. I needed her to show me step by step with an actual hand and not rely on feckless visual metaphors.

To further confuse: during one section of the DVD, Blanca's dancing doesn't line up with the voice over instruction or the music. This made following her and the music (which she stressed) very hard to do.

Also as soon as one move was demonstrated, the DVD just went on to the next move without much review of what was just learned. There are also no pause times between learning moves and it is for this main reason that I would not recommend this DVD for beginners.

During the warm-up and cool down stretches, Blanca once again moved to quickly, and didn't explain the exercise in time with her movements. She would explain a move while she did it or suddenly change directions of stretches out of nowhere. This made it tricky to focus on learning anything and I felt more like I was just awkwardly trying to keep up. The warm up and cool downs were also ineffective and I was unsure of the proper way to breath or if it would help ( I know that sounds whiny but it's true).

Another bugger was the arm positions instruction: Blanca would out of nowhere call out an arm position (goddess arms or princess arms) without any prior discussion of them or even explaining how to why to use them with what type of belly dance.

I hate to sound like I am bashing the DVD because I am not. I really liked it as a matter of fact and would just like to see some improvement. Overall, the Blanca's instruction was enjoyable and a good work out for me as a lover of dance. But for me, as a beginner, it was exhausting and confusing.",1234742400,27,2660,4.329317269076305

You see her full body so you can see the foot movements along with the arm movements. The pace is slow enough for beginners, yet everyone is able to go with it and not feel too slow.  She demonstrates a movement and then builds on it so you're able to see how a whole dance routine can be created and put together. She has beautiful costumes and music.  My children enjoy watching it and trying to do it also. She's a beautiful dancer, and she takes the time to explain the why's of a movement, not just the how, like why the dancer's eye contact or lack of can make (insert impression) on viewer.  i really enjoyed it. :)",1219190400,3,780,4.321917808219178
2831338,5,B000Q66G3S,"This video has a lot going for it, not the least of which was the price. It was much longer than anticipated. There's a long technique section, a warm up, a short-short shimmy section, and a choreography teaching section. And she repeats the entire choregraphy teaching twice with different camera angles. One shows what her hips and legs are doing and the other shows exactly what her arms are doing (Often skipped in other videos)

  The Dances--She does the full dance you've learned without her cueing at the end. Then she does the full dance again plus a couple extra(easy) steps in full dress to slower music. And she does another full dance in full dress to music that has an almost classical style.

  The slow sensual style of the dance she teaches combined with the imagery she gives you is a winner. I could definitely imagine doing this dance for an audience of one.",1218153600,2,878,4.632258064516129
2831339,3,B000Q66G3S,"I'm sorry but this wasn't a five star DVD. Infact,I fell asleep for a few minutes.  Maybe it's Blanca's monotone voice.  Indeed it is relaxing, however a little too relaxing.  The speech on how to be sensuous I had to skip over. Blanca talks on how to be sensuous and what is sensuality, ""nature, oceans, etc,"" but strikes  the common stero-typical pose of languishing passively on a fabricated Sultanish setup on a green lawn.  Yawn.
Back to basics. The first instructional part was so slow, broken down and minutely detailed that I was getting bored and impatient. But I kept on. Then the second instructional part provided relief. Blanca goes through the same movements with more energy and voice overs which makes the movements and at home class session flow. With a flow you can pick up movements easier. Breaking down brings you out of your body and into your head. Also,the background was so dark that it encouraged nap time.",1216166400,24,932,4.763975155279503

2831370,5,B000Q66G3S,"I read through all the helpful reviews and decided to buy - and I am EXTREMELY glad I did.  While I have been dancing for 5+ years, I still consider myself intermediate, especially when I need to take periods of time off.  This was the pefect video to get back into the swing of things.

Blanca is clear, easy to follow, and doesn't let her teaching outfit get in the way of seeing her movements.  She has both warm-up and cool-down sections geared for muscles stretching and control without tiring you out before you even begin the dance.  Blanca uses the progression method of teaching, so you can master each section before advancing on to the next level of the technique, with adequate repetion and instruction to understand what you are doing. My only regret: she never turns around so you can dance with her and see the movements from behind.

From a dvd tech standpoint, the menu is broken down into fairly short sections so you don't have to spend forever fast forwarding your way to what you want.  She does basic foundation for all portions, then performs in costume, and then teaches you the dance itself using the same progression technique.  If you need to repeat a section, it is very easily to find the section until you are happy with yourself.

I would not recommend this to someone who has never had a live teacher  because she is teaching a style rather than the dance per se. Having said that, if you have taken a standard 8-10 week intro course -- go for it!  This can only improve your flow of movement.

I would also recommend this to someone who loves the dance, but does not have the energy or physical capacity for the more 'bouncy' styles of modern bellydance or wants a change of pace from constant shimmies or continuous fast dancing, but still wants the work out and the technique of more traditional belly dance. She does do shimmies, and she can move quickly, but it's also integreted into the dance, rather than the sum of it. And if you don't yet know how to shimmy, you can still do the dance.

All in all, a great workout, a great technique builder, a great value for your money. I enjoyed learning and performing the dance she taught and already have ideas for working some of her moves into dances of my own.

Well, for those interested here's my one to five scale. One is blah and five fantastic.

Audio -5
Picture-5
Detailed explanations-5 (loved this Blanca uses imagery so I get the concept quicker

Fluidity -5 This is where Blanca really outshines my other DVD's.  Except for Jenna's drum one, but that one is for the more advanced.  Blanca even makes the warm ups looks sexy.

Program length-5 two hours

Cost:  5 totally worth it.  Her DVD is unlike my other DVD's so I'm going to have to say their not comparable.  She adds the fluidity and sexiness that the others kind of lack.

2831464,5,B000Q66G3S,"Does ""Sensual Belly Dance"" sound like a cringe-worthy work? I wasn't sure what to expect when I first saw the package. But Blanca does a great job of explaining her take on ""sensuality"" without leaving her viewer feeling uncomfortable or coming across as too silly herself. Blanca explains that sensuality is about communicating what you're feeling to others and, of course, this works great for a dancer. She shares her ideas of translating one's inner feelings into a body language viewable by the audience. She describes the use of sensuality as a way to ""add a flair of sensual grace and ease to your dance"" and speaks about the flow and pacing of one's performance. Her ideas of really utilizing emotion and storytelling during dancer are not often covered in instructional works and are wonderful to see presented here to a wider viewing audience.

After this intriguing introduction the DVD package offers viewers a little bit of everything from technical tips to improvisational ideas to polishing ones performances. First come two different ""Flow"" sections, one on technique and one based on simply dancing. Then Blanca presents a short choreography. There's a demo, a breakdown, and you can even choose to focus on just one part of the practice such as lower or upper body. Next Blanca provides a selection of clips demonstrating a variety of poses, providing watchers with numerous ideas they could add into their own repertoire. And there's also an additional invaluable resource where Blanca explains the idea of telling a story with dance. This is wonderful for performers seeking a way to give their performance extra ""oomph"" and also nice for those dancers just beginning to seek the stage lights.

As for the ""meat"" of the DVD, here's a bit of info on the Flow sections:

""Fluidity Warmup:"" From the very beginning of her ""Fluidity Warmup,"" Blanca begins to introduce her concept of ""sensuality in dance."" The gentle warmup and stretches include some very nice arm work as Blanca explains how to do each stretch in a ""sensual"" manner, that is with impact and purpose. While Blanca moves through the movements quickly she clearly explains the focus of each (lifting the head, bending at the waist, etc). Although each tiny little flourish may not be broken down, an intermediate level dance could easily follow her clear display of movement. In addition to the stretches, Blanca uses the warmup to review a variety of basic movements including hip slides, reverse mayas, hip circles, and single hip work.

""Technique Articulation:"" During this section of the DVD, Blanca explains the nuances of the movements she uses in the combinations. This section is also designed to help you work on your articulation for each movement, improving your range of motion, strength, and balance while dancing. These movements are sort of ""mini drills"" that would work quite nicely for cabaret dancers.

""Technique Shimmy:"" Similar to the articulation section, Blanca gives viewers a separate section for shimmy work. Included are very detailed tips for creating a shimmy that is controlled and matching the music as well as breakdowns for the various shimmies and layers she uses later in the program.

""Technique Progressions:"" Here Blanca reviews a number of layered traveling steps. Beginning with the footwork, she later adds on arms and additional hip movements.

""Technique Sensual Poses:"" This final section is the cool down for the DVD. Blanca dances through the cool down as the viewer follows along, demonstrating several of her unique poses. Each movement (like snake arms, hip circle, etc) is not broken down, but Blanca does explain each pose clearly.

The next part of the DVD is the ""Flow"" section. This part is divided into the same headings as the ""Technique"" and provides viewers with the chance to simply dance along with Blanca. For the most part, the material is the same as that which was covered in the technical sections, although there is some additional arm work, but this time it is fluid and presented as dance movement. The DVD has an option to follow the ""Flow"" without Blanca's voice-over and with just the music. There is roughly 40 minutes worth of material, here, providing the viewer with what amounts to her or his own personal class in ""sensual bellydance.""

The choreography is surprisingly long for a DVD that already has so much information. As mentioned above, the combinations are demonstrated and explained after Blanca performs the full piece. The combos are rather quickly shown but all of the information has already been broken down in the Flow sections. Blanca's work is a cabaret piece with a lot of emotion and a great practice work for those seeking to learn to put more expression in their dance.

What worked for me:
* I really loved the way Blanca breaks down movements. She uses a lot of visual imagery and creates a clear picture of each move. Blanca even uses some really creative visual aids to impart her ideas.
* Separate technique sections. This was really nice as a dancer could go to each section and just review that particular part (so working on the transition/progressions as opposed to having to go all the way through a choreography like in some other DVDs).
* The pose idea section - it was great to see the different ideas for poses and, also, to see some of them executed in different ways.
* The inclusion of so much information about performing. THANK YOU! So many DVDs now focus on technique, but there are very few that mention performance and even fewer that do both!

What may not work for you:
* If you are not used to opening your stance a bit as you dance you may find some of these movements and combos to be challenging. Blanca's movements are lush and full, often requiring a fairly open stance in order to really get the look of the move.
* I stress again that this is a DVD for more experienced dancers. A baby belly may become quickly overwhelmed by the speed at which the material is covered. However, there are definitely concepts here that will benefit new dancers, and this is certainly a production that they could ""grow into.""
* The red backdrop/lighting. The hues reflecting on Blanca are pretty, but after 40 minutes can make your eyes a bit fuzzy.",1196726400,20,6244,4.881132075471698
2831465,5,B000Q66G3S,"When I first heard of this dvd I was a little put-off by the name ""Sensual Bellydance"", but the reeviews on Amazon persuaded me to order it. I was not disapointed! I've only had my copy for a few days and have not managed to  use the entire dvd yet. So this review contains my initial impressions.

Blanca moves very fluidly and dances beautifully. Her performances are excellent and demonstrate what she teaches on tis dvd. I found her technique breakdowns to be very clear and detailed--including visualizations and details such as the orientation of the head. The flow section is very effective at helping the user practice the feeling and techniques of this sensual style.

Best of all, this dvd really does provide a ""missing link"" as another reviewer mentioned. I love that Blanka's style is fluid and uses the entire body rather than an assortment of ""isolations"". Most beginner/intermediate level instruction that I""ve seen really focuses a little too much on isolations, which are great to practice to build body control but can lead to segmented and stiff dancing when overdone. I am impressed that she manages to teach basic/intermediate technique in a more holistic way and that expresses the sensuality of this dance form. Dancers who use this dvd would develop performance skills along with technique and an enjoyable dance experience.

My only problem with this dvd so far is that I find it too inspiring so I never finish the entire dvd session. At some point, I feel an urge to put on some music I love and just dance!

Who may not be interested in this dvd:
*Those who want an intense workout may find it a little too relaxing, though portions could be incorporated on light days or as a warm-up/cool down.  This dvd is dance focussed rather than exercise focussed and much of the dancing is slow in tempo.
*Dancers focussed on a specific ethnic style of Oriental Dance (bellydance)... Dancers focussed on Turkish, Egyptian or other styles may find some of Blanka's technique conflicts with their own. However, I think some dancers of this style may still enjoy it for developing fluidity and the ability to ""feel"" the dance and express sensuality through dance.
*Absolute beginners may prefer a different dvd to start. It is hard for me to say as I didn't use dvds as beginner, but I think it could be great for beginners who have established good basic technique.

Who would enjoy this dvd:
*Advanced beginners-Intermediate dancers who would like to move from practicing technique to fluid and sensual dancing! For that matter, this would also be good for advanced dancers who are more technique driven and want to soften their focus a bit.
*Those who admire Blanka's dance style and want to incorporate it into their own.
*Dancers who are intrigued by ""Goddess"" imagery may love this! I am not one of those dancers, but Blanka does it in a way that doesn't bother me. She is a great example for those who like to incorporate fantasy elements into their dance in a way that is both powerful and natural.",1196121600,13,3023,4.7796934865900385

There are 42 items in it by now and Blanca appears in 3 of them - Golden Apple performances, Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout and as one of the 'students' in Ayshe's Core fitness. I already had an image of her as a graceful dancer and good teacher, so considering the price of the DVD, I went ahead and preordered.

For me there are a few telltales if the money I've invested in a video will be worth it. Here is what I look for:
1. Quality/fame of the instructor
2. Lenght of intruction
3. Producer (NY and IAMED being my favorite)
4. Target bellydance level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
5. Instruction or fitness
6. Reviews

I had some information about 1,3,5 but nothing about the rest, so I wasn't entirely sure what exactly to expect. It came as a nice surprise when I popped the video in the ROM, pressed ""play all"" and saw Blanca seated on green grass offering some introduction in her crispy accent to what she was about to teach. I always consider it a plus when they spare the time for a few words to say about the product and its concept.

Next we see Blanca in a brightly lit studio with red curtains. Even though her outfit is red as well, it never blends with the background, so everything can be seen very well. Her belly, hands and feet are visible all the time, very important while learning bellydance from a video.

The first part of the DVD is entitled ""FLOW"". In the first few chapters Blanca breaks down the movements in the second part in segments, offering a warmup, articulations and a cooldown. She goes slow, without any repetition, just pinpointing the important aspects of the movements. She uses a lot of visual descriptions and comparisons which makes it easy for students to imagine and copy her style. The influence of Ayshe and Jehan Gamal is evident in the entire DVD too.

Blanca pays a lot of attention to the ""articulations"" section. She would first show step patterns, then elaborate hip and chest movements, then completes the combination with hands and glances. A student can easily see all segments of a particular movement and observe the gestures and hints that make it look graceful and fluid.

In the flow sections all are tied together accompanied by Blanca's explanations. This is a faster paced section and the stress is not on the mechanics of the movements but how to string them up and elaborate a combination or give it a little spice. Next you can play the entire flow section voice off, only with music. It allows for great practice.

The next section is a choreography entitled Venus. Blance performs it first in the beautiful red costume from the cover and after down breaks it down in several combinations, calling out the movements as she goes through them. She offers very little instruction here, instead falling back on what she already taught previously in great details. After that you can follow Blanca as she dances in her training outfit, with the music on only (no voice).

The next section is what makes this DVD truly unique. In it the choreography is shown once again, this time names of different poses pop up as certain movements are highlighted. It provides a great vocabulary of movements and also gives you a chance to observe and compare different gestures, steps, poses, glances, all these subtle hues that make bellydance sensual bellydance. Following Blanca's articulations from the first section you can get inspired to build your own combinations and choreographies.

In the next chapter Blanca performs the Venus choreography again, this time in a different costume and with voice-over. She offers a ""story"" that the dance may tell, of the expressions and meanings of gestures and their ultimate source.

The last section of this DVD is two beautiful performances by Blanca, one of them the Venus choreography again she covered with a story and the DVD points out helpfully it includes floorwork. This part itself is short and light, indeed demonstrating the difference between sensual and sexual (as we know why it is banned in Egypt).

Music and credits are the last two options you can check out.

A few words to sum up the contents:
-- Excellent instruction. Beginners would be very pleased with the slow and detailed explanations of the movements in the first section; intermediate and advanced can review it once or twice and then skip on straight to the practice section without getting bored
-- Original and interesting choreography
-- Inspirational and creative atmosphere
-- 120 min run time

This DVD is good for students of all levels of bellydance, though I definitely would not suggest it to anyone who haven't mastered the fundamendals (such as hip lifts and undulations). Late beginners would find a lot of material to work on and progress; intermediate and strong intermediate are offered fresh ideas and concepts in addition to an entire choreography.

I would definitely recommend this DVD to all dancers. It is exteremely good value for money and a must-have in every serious student's collection.",1195948800,118,5128,4.8125

She has great body awareness that you can feel & mimic easily. The production is high quality, the camera angles are very cool, it zooms in when needed & mostly stays back which is good.

I have loved Blanca's beautiful body awareness since I saw her in Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout. Blanca shows that w/o body awareness, no matter how skillfully & athletically you can move your body in a certain way, you must be aware of your body energetically & it's environment & be in touch with the music or you will look lifeless, stiff, robotic, and boring overall. Everyone knows this subconsciously. Rania is a perfect example of this. She is skillful, but she's not in touch & therefore she over exaggerating her moves, you can see her thinking of what to do next instead of being in the moment. Ask anyone, male or female... what is more mesmerizing? Someone who can execute moves
skillfully but robot-like, or someone w/less control, less experience/skill, but is in the moment w/passion, and can blend their body's energy with the music in perfect harmony? Skill can always be taught through repetition.",1195257600,,5561,4.713257965056526
2831470,5,B000Q66G3S,"This is finally a dvd that breaks things down so you can learn the moves, but isn't stupid dance moves.  This dvd also tells many secrets to the fluid and graceful moves of the dance.  Excellent dvd and it is packed with tons of moves.",1195171200,,235,4.2
2831471,5,B000Q66G3S,"I per ordered this DVD in the hopes it would present a sensual touch to my dance.  Boy did it ever!

Blanca is dressed in a way that you can clearly see her legs. Her moves are wide and gracefully adding a way to dance not general seen from the smaller moves that are more popular today.  I really enjoyed the lack of popping and locking.  The background she choose was perfect changing with each section.  It's also easy on the eyes.

Blanca tells the viewer how to execute the moves and show you them a few time till you get it.  At a whooping 2 hours this DVD is packed full of info for the advanced beginner to intermidate dancer.

In each of the performaces on the DVD Blanca plays her role well.  Everything about the set is perfect.  The way Blanca dance really says volumes.  I really enjoy this DVD.  The only con would be maybe to have more time to practice the moves but since it's a DVD you can just rewind.

I look forward to her next DVD and the Fantasy Belly Dance DVDs.",1194739200,2,985,4.175531914893617
2831472,5,B000Q66G3S,"I'm not sure I can add anything to what other reviewers have said. But I need to. You see, I've been looking for just this video from the time I first began belly dancing. Belly dance video groups will remember my discovering a spellbinding clip of Blanca dancing (I recommend a search for her clips on youtube) and asking whom I had to kill to learn to dance that way. What I'd found so mesmerizing was that she danced with all of herself. Body and mind. The result was indescribable and beautiful sensuality and emotion. Watch her - it's difficult to spell out.

What makes this video so different is not the choreography or the exercises - though those are lovely too. It's the wholehearted attempt to get you, the learner, in touch with your own sensuality. Aside from following the movements, listen to what she's telling you. Let go and allow her to engage you enough to open up to how you feel and communicate. You should feel a difference in all of your dancing.

And because it isn't just about the 9 combinations that make up the dance, you will spend a lot of time working on how to get fluidity and effortlessness into your movements. That's where the warm ups and flows come in. You will learn, for example, how to put resistance into your moves to communicate passion. Or slowing down to express savouring femininity. Particularly lovely is the unique section on this video on how to weave a story into your dance to bring it alive with meaning. Try it with any other dance to see how it could work.

For those familiar with the World Dance format, there are some interesting variations here. The choreography is done many times, differently: you will focus on the upper body moves separately, then the lower body and foot work. And then all together, with and without music.

In this video, dancing is not about gimmickry and heaping one clever move upon another. And may I say what a relief that is. For a change, the idea is not to make your jaw drop. It's to draw you into an experience of intense and passionate enjoyment.

Rather special attention has been paid to the music chosen for this video. I contacted Blanca to talk to her about her video and make this review more informative, and here's some of what she had to say. ""I can't explain how important the music is. These days the aspect of the dance I'm most interested in is musicality. If a dancer is musical, I can watch her for hours. I love when the dancer's body becomes one more instrument, creating her own melody over the already existing song. I was lucky to find the wonderful and sensual music we used on this DVD. We required a variety of tempo, mood and styles, but I wanted every piece to be absolutely beautiful and sensual. Movses Panossian's ""Serpent's Rapture"" was a great Flow opener because its grandiosity gives you no choice but to wake up and start moving. Ruben Van Rompaey's ""Miyuki"" is perfect for the articulation section because the rhythm is very clear nuanced.  Djinn's ""Brooklyn Baladi"" is the quintessential Arabic hip walk teaching song.  And Stellamara's ""Persephone"" had me choreographing the cooldown section in one take, with my eyes closed, listening to the music and what my body wanted to do. For the performance, Pete List composed the music entirely based on my choreography. He invited the incredibly talented Chern Hwei Fung to play violin. In addition we have the choreography taught to the beautiful song ""Ifrit"" by Tim Rayborn.""

Another wonderful thing Blanca told me - and this can be put into motion by dancers even if they haven't seen this video yet - is how a dancer's movements are like waves. ""Look at something that makes you think of sensuality: long hair, a serpent, a cat's tail, desert dunes... the wave is always there and it looks like it's moving even if it's still. It's not defined when one wave ends and the next starts, waves are always dancing on top of each other. When a dancer is moving sensually, there is that quality of continuous movement, of one thing melting into the next one."" Perhaps this gives an idea of what this dancer's approach is.

I hope others find the same enjoyment I am from learning with this video.",1193702400,19,4170,4.616734143049933
8194326,5,B000Q66G3S,"I do like it but this is not for beginners. I would recommend it too fast learner beginners, beginners who know the basics and yet fast learners, beginners verging on intermediate, and intermediate dancers. You might have to watch this a few time still or come back to it later. I know a good deal concerning the basics and recognize some of the movements, but might have to come back to this at some point. I will keep it because I know with time, practice, and patience I will get to that level.",1503014400,,497,4.354838709677419

This DVD is fresh air for me, who only wants to learn to dance sensually for my lover.  Her editors may have abbreviated some of her tutoring but that section alone is so helpful. Blanca demonstrates how to make moves sensual and graceful. I had already decided this DVD was the ultimate one for me, then I found her dance and the combinations that went into it. As much as I love her dance, I can see that it will be a lot of work breaking it down to learn it. Blanca is not Jillina, and her run through is quick and not repeated over and over until the student has learned it. BUT, I love her dance and feel it is the one for me to learn. As for weaknesses pointed out by other reviewers, I'm sure we all have other Bellydance DVD's to learn those techniques from.
