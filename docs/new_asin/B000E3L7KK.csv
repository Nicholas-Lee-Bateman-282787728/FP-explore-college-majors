8105099,4,B000E3L7KK,"This 1964 classic also known as ""Monstrosity"" starts out with ""out of tune"" horny or brassy type music. And the music keeps up until the end. There is some dialog but mostly it is a Bradford Dillman narration. On the plus side they show the pictures of the people with names attached so you get to know the actors. Bradford has made TV appearances well into the 1990's.
------------

With the help of a rogue scientist, Dr. Otto frank (Frank Grestle) kept on retainer, she intends to have her brain (through the miracle of modern 1964 atomics), transferred into a young body. The body is to be selected from three candidates. Which one will it be? Anita from Spain, Nina from Austria, or Bea from England?

""RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON"" (1952) --- A Republic Serial was the first Commando Cody serial, in 12 chapters, starring newcomer George Wallace (1917-2005) as Cody and Aline Towne as his sidekick Joan Gilbert, with serial veteran Roy Barcroft as the evil Retik, the Ruler of the Moon --- The director was Fred C. Brannon, with a screenplay by Ronald Davidson and special effects by the Lydecker brothers --- Commando Cody has available for his use the rocket-powered flying suit (described in dialog as an ""atomic-powered rocket suit"" in the previous but unrelated serial in which it was used, King of the Rocket Men) and a rocket ship capable of reaching the moon. Suddenly the U.S. finds itself under attack as a mysterious something wipes out military bases and industrial complexes --- Cody deduces somehow that the earth faces a menace from our own moon, and rockets there to discover and confront the moon's dictator Retik, who boldly announces plans to conquer our planet and move his subjects there --- However, there is a singular lack of science-fictional derring-do in the episodes.  --- Many of the cars are old enough to have completely vertical uncurved windshields, and Cody spends most of his time fist-fighting on Earth with an elusive lunar native, Krog, and the gang of crooks he has hired to steal and stockpile supplies for the invasion, and to continue to create strategic damage with a truck-mounted raygun --- Watch for Clayton Moore as Krog's chief earthling assistant --- Stock footage from earlier Republic Studios serials, all the way from The Purple Monster Strikes (1945) to King of the Rocket Men, is used extensively --- Virtually nothing really happens until the final confrontation with Retik in Chapter 12, and anyone who remembered The Purple Monster Strikes from seven years before had already seen all of that confrontation!
