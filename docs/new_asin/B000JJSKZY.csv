2673669,4,B000JJSKZY,"Don't get me wrong, I think John Pinette is the Funniest Man on Earth. I saw the edited version of this DVD last night on Comedy Central. John is repeating too much material from his prior DVD and CD. Great stuff, very funny, but I say NAY NAY---you've done it before, John!  You need more new material. I'm buying this anyway, but please retire ""Free Willy"" and ""Fat Man at the Water Park""!",1169424000,34,391,4.3561643835616435

2673717,5,B000JJSKZY,This is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen.....I started out owning the cd. I was playing it on a trip and was laughing so hard I had to pull off the highway. It is clean and very clever. He mostly makes fun of himself. The parts about him in an Italian restaurant and a Chinese buffet will have you laughing so hard you might hyper ventilate. The dvd is of course as funny since its the same show.,1518652800,,407,4.037037037037037

2673829,5,B000JJSKZY,"You will love this DVD.  We lost Mr. Pinette a few years back, but what an experience it would have been to go to one of his shows.  His smile is angelic.  His comedy keeps you wanting more.  I laughed hysterically and played the DVD over and over again.  He loved everyone - regardless of race, creed, color.  He spoke well of people and made fun only of himself - in a way that we could all relate to.  God bless him.",1480896000,,419,4.036585365853658
2673850,5,B000JJSKZY,I only rented it for a specified time period - but he was the funniest man I have ever listened to. I was sad to hear that he recently passed away. What a great comic and likable man he was. I wish I had been able to see him in person.  I go back to hulu and watch the one he made later - Still Starving. So worth watching him - as he brings such great shared comic moments in everyone's lives - and here we failed to see the humor as these same things happened to some of us.,1479340800,,476,3.76

My husband and I loved sharing it with folks who have never heard of John, and who identify with his perspectives on food.

We felt as if he were our personal discovery, and promoted his work to everyone who could use a good clean laugh to balance out the stress of everyday living.

His entertainment in this DVD is clearly his best work. It is professionally polished, and superbly delivered, best of all it is 99% clean. I looked forward to much more from John.

Nevertheless, repeated watching is bittersweet, particularly for me. The unexpected loss of this talented young artist in 2014 is a tragedy, and one that I will always remember as it occurred on my birthday. Rest in peace, John and thanks for the laughs.",1438992000,4,897,4.4573170731707314

This video of his sold-out performance at the The Montreal Comedy Festival in 2006 after he had left the Broadway hit Hairspray, was one of his funniest.  Using new material and some of his older favorites he totally entertains you.  Highly recommended and a terrific way to escape from you troubles and laugh.

Of course, he only did an abbreviated version of his act, and I thought he was funny.  After seeing his entire act, I have to recover from a side that is aching from laughter!  What a hilarious act!  It's so sad that he died recently, and at only age 50, he left us way too soon.  He had a lot more humor to share with us.

I don't' mind the occasional F-bomb when used in context to the joke, but I don't enjoy it used all the time. Anyway, Jon never uses it, but tells stories and jokes in a very PG-13 way.

I highly recommend folks see his work and enjoy what he loved doing, stand-up.",1403395200,,432,4.204819277108434

We'd ""discovered him"" while watching some snips of him on YouTube.  One day I thought ""all those first bits of his that we saw were from a TV special; I'll bet I could order that on Amzon Instant Video!  We could see ALL OF IT, on the BIG SCREEN, with excellent audio and video!"" ( as opposed to seeing fragments on my iPad).  We ordered it and watched it right then and there!  We both laughed so hard and for so long, we had tears in our eyes!  He was a truly funny man, and there was SO MUCH that we hadn't seen until we watched ""I'm Starvin' ""  his comedy is all the more funny when you can see his facial expressions, too!  And yes!  It truly made a HUGE difference seeing it on the big plasma screen instead of my iPad.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!",1403049600,,888,4.045977011494253

2674325,5,B000JJSKZY,"Very enjoyable.  Everything from deep belly laughs to chuckles.  Pretty clean.  Unlike some comedians, he does not place heavy reliance on the ""F"" word or scatological comments.  Mr. Pinette's talent with dialects is impressive.  Sadly, he passed away not long ago, so I encourage you to enjoy this.",1402617600,,299,5.145833333333333
2674326,4,B000JJSKZY,"I enjoyed seeing a show of John on the comedy central channel and said to myself someday I will get a dvd of his performance. Sadly not too long after seeing John on television, he passed away. This makes his stand-up even more sentimental to have. He is a very funny guy and I enjoy watching him.

2674347,4,B000JJSKZY,"We're going to miss this amazing fellow, who was wildly funny.  He passed away recently.  Seinfeld fans will remember him as the portly young gentleman who was accosted in front of the Seinfeld gang, they filmed it instead of helping, and went to jail under the Good Samaritan law, in the controversial Seinfeld finale.

He's on stage in Montreal in a one man show in this terrific film.  And every now and then, he uses his patented ""Nay, Nay"" and the audience is with him all the way.

Even a passing reference by John Pinette to a buffet for anyone who knows his, shall we say, body of work, is laugh out loud funny.  There is also an obvious warmth to this guy that shows whenever he reacts to the theater audience here enjoying his work.

Give this young fellow a try.  You won't be disappointed.",1401580800,,801,4.438356164383562

One of this things I particularly enjoyed: He's not swearing in every breath. I've always thought cussing is the lazy way to get laughs, and he didn't take the easy way out. He was a master at storytelling, and a master at facial expressions.",1398643200,,482,4.415730337078652

He conveys truth about life (mostly food!) without excessive vulgarity and without the shock responses that have become so common in recent comedians.  Although the material is definitely not ""family friendly,"" we find virtually all of his material inoffensive to moral or worldview sensibilities.  He stays ""on topic,"" captures and represents his own experiences and problems quite well.  Ironically, his humor is even funny for individuals who have eating disorders -- what he presents is truth, in itself often painful, in a comical and acceptable way.",1398556800,,629,5.453608247422681

Relating his experiences from the Broadway stage and how he got into ""shape"" to play Edna Turnblad in ""Hairspray"" was simply hilarious. I was greatly saddened by his recent passing and the world has lost a spark of comedic genius as a result. I would recommend this to anyone who has struggled with food, weight, exercise or life in general. While there are a few mild expletives in the show, the content is not explicit or sexual. One of those comedians who can make you laugh without resorting to blue content and constant use of harsh language. RIP, John.

2674496,5,B000JJSKZY,"I rented this the day I heard of Pinette's passing. On a thread, I said I was going to watch it and ""cry until I laugh"". That's what I did.

From the first time I saw John Pinette, in a club in Los Angeles, I was in love. Not only the best of the comedy that night, but a singing voice of an angel. I followed his career like a stalker. I was amazed he never did a sit-com. But, his concerts were always golden.

This is a later concert, after he was on Broadway. No singing, as a matter of fact his voice seems a little damaged. But still funny.",1397260800,,546,3.90990990990991
2674507,5,B000JJSKZY,One of the funniest men ever. Always wanted to see him live but unfortunately it's to late for that. He was take from us to soon. Please watch and enjoy a very funny comedian,1397260800,,174,4.147058823529412

2674509,5,B000JJSKZY,We were all in tears from laughing so hard while watching this.  He is so funny.  Not mean.  Not vulgar.  Hysterical.,1397174400,,117,4.428571428571429
2674510,5,B000JJSKZY,I laughed my head off. Funniest thing ever! Loved it. He is the best comedian. I found myself saying nay nay. Have to see his stand up comedy act.,1397088000,,146,4.068965517241379
2674511,5,B000JJSKZY,"""I'm Starvin!"" is one of John Pinette's best performances. (Those who may be unfamiliar with his work will probably know him as the guy who was carjacked in the final episode of ""Seinfeld."") From his Broadway experiences to exercising to dealing with family and, of course, his love of (and battles with) food, Pinette's self-deprecating humor and skill with impressions will leave you wanting more. His sudden and unexpected passing in April 2014 stunned his fans and his friends in the entertainment world, but he leaves behind a great legacy of over 25 years of stand-up comedy, of which this is only a small part. I also recommend his other concert DVD, ""Still Hungry,"" as well as his ""Show Me the Buffet"" audio CD (don't bother with the ""I Say Nay Nay"" CD if you get ""I'm Starvin!"", as they're almost identical with regards to the material).",1397088000,4,846,4.761904761904762

2674535,5,B000JJSKZY,"the special starts a little slow with him updating his core fans about what he has been doing rather than comedy for the last little bit of time... and it just get funnier and funnier the longer you watch.

He brings to light the things we all think but are afraid to act on (like at a restaurant people who agonize over if the want sprite or coke for 30 seconds -- wanting to yell ILL BUY THEM BOTH FOR YOU JUST GET OUT OF LINE!!)

John Pinette's stand up is the funniest, laugh till you hurt show I have seen in SUCH a LONG time.  No cheap use of profanity or vulgarity to hide a lack of talent or the loss of talent to Coke and Alcohol addiction.  John's wit and timing is reminiscent of Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.  A PG Drug free Robyn Williams, Eddie Murphy, or Richard Prior.

If you want a laugh, press play",1393977600,,490,4.4

I added this to my watchlist over the last few days and as we were looking for something to watch before we fell asleep, I hit the play button on this comedy special.  Admittedly I was too tired and fell asleep as it was originally playing, but I heard wife 2.0 chuckling pretty hard multiple times as I was drifting away.  I wound up sitting and watching it the next day, in the afternoon, when I was wide awake and like her I found myself laughing heartily.  I would say though that I suspect John Pinette, or whomever he put this routine together with, are guilty of intellectual property theft as his thoughts on salad (it's what my food eats) are so close to my own (which others have heard me clearly state many times over the years ;-) )

Very, very funny special.  Enough so that I wound up renting the 'I'm still hungry' special later to watch it with wife 2.0.  We were both equally entertained by that special, making it well worth the rental fee.",1390780800,,1057,4.362244897959184

2674689,5,B000JJSKZY,John Pinette is wonderful at painting a picture in your mind as he reports his comedic experiences to the point where you actually think you are there with him as he experienced it!  Very funny and a great way to wind down from a stressful day!,1371772800,,244,4.304347826086956

2674697,5,B000JJSKZY,John Pinette is hilarious.  I show this to all my friends.  I even bought the audio book version so I can cheaply stream it to my car while driving.  You HAVE to check it out!,1369785600,,175,3.942857142857143
2674698,4,B000JJSKZY,This was one of the first videos I watched with Amazon Prime.  I've seen John Pinette's stand up before and really enjoyed him.  This video won't disappoint.  He's still funny as ever.,1369180800,,184,4.6875
2674699,5,B000JJSKZY,"John is hilarious.  I watched both of his movies on Netflix and was cracking up like crazy.  My Grandma loved it so much, she wanted to get the DVD for her brother.  Good deal, and worth the money.",1369008000,,197,4.131578947368421

Our 18 year old Granddaughter had us watch her DVD of I'm Starvin when we visited her and we just had to get our own when we arrived home. So you can see this is for the teen age years to the senior citizens. We will watch it many times and show it to friends and family. Would also be a great gift for someone.",1368835200,,420,3.839080459770115
2674701,5,B000JJSKZY,"I brought this to a get-together with some friends and everyone enjoyed it.  We all laughed and laughed and laughed.  It's so nice to watch a comedian whose purpose is to make you laugh, instead of using the stage as an opportunity to share their political and social views.",1368144000,,274,4.571428571428571

2674704,5,B000JJSKZY,This is one of the funniest DVD's ever. this is why he sells out wherever he goes. A little slow at the start but you will be in pain by the end. FUNNY!,1367366400,,152,3.6363636363636362
2674705,5,B000JJSKZY,Up until this movie I had only heard John Pinette on radio.  His facial expressions were worth seeing him for and they alone made me laugh at times.  Really a great comic!,1367107200,,171,4.3125
2674706,4,B000JJSKZY,"I have to say, very few stand up comedians can hold my attention like John. I would definitely recommend watching this.",1366761600,,119,4.714285714285714
2674707,5,B000JJSKZY,In todays world most comedians need to be vulgar or use blue humor.... oh nay nay says John Pinette. Good clean humor mostly at his own expense. Saw him perform on a cruise line a few years ago and would not hesitate to see him again.,1366156800,,234,4.108695652173913

Lmao nuff said!",1366156800,,102,4.15
2674709,5,B000JJSKZY,"This was right after his return from Broadway and getting back into stand-up.  It is a mix of some new material, and some re-worked old stuff.  The old stuff feel a bit rushed and cut short, but that is only if you know the older versions word for word (which I happen to).

Overall, it is fun, enjoyable and a great view of John Pinette at his finest.",1365984000,,352,4.147058823529412

2674712,5,B000JJSKZY,"John Pinette is SO FUNNY!!  ""I'm Starvin'""  is his best DVD...I have seen 2 others (I Say Nay Nay  and  Still Hungry) and this one is by far the funniest,  BUT the others are also hilarious and have some material that is not on ""I'm Starvin'"" so they are definitely worth watching.  His material is so genuine and is relatable to so many people -- and his facial expressions and gestures make his act one-of-a-kind. There is minimal cursing and nothing serious (like the ""f"" word).  BTW, I rec'd mine from Amazon damaged and am sending it back, but I already ordered the replacement because it is so worth it!!",1364688000,,610,4.490909090909091

2674714,5,B000JJSKZY,DVD is hysterical. John Pinette is a true funny man. Will order more of his DVD's. His stories are all about himself & his life experiences. His way with words keep the laughing going strong. Yopu'll love this guy if you don't already.,1364688000,,235,4.488372093023256
2674715,4,B000JJSKZY,John Pinette is a very funny storyteller. His timing is perfect and his facial expressions set it all up. He doesn't have to revert to off color jokes. Ney Ney. Looking for a good laugh? Try John Pinette.,1364515200,,204,4.394736842105263

2674718,5,B000JJSKZY,"Very funny.  A few curse words (the only thing I don't care for in this show)  Pinette is who he is and he likes food, and if you don't like him, tough! ;)",1364169600,,155,3.6666666666666665
2674719,4,B000JJSKZY,"This has to be one of the best stand up comedians out there. Very popular on XM radio for his cruise ship skit, I was impressed by his depth and staying power. Love his ""Nay Nay!"".",1364083200,,180,4.027777777777778
2674720,5,B000JJSKZY,Probably the best you will see of his shows. Just plain funny and good for all ages. Very little profanity.,1362787200,,107,4.4

2674723,5,B000JJSKZY,"I have always heard that laughter is the best medicine and I have to agree!  I was feeling the winter blues, living in Michigan during the months of October through March you never know what you're going to get in the way of frigid cold snow storms but winter always gives me the blues.  My dear husband surprised me with a Kindle Fire for my end of December birthday and I was browsing through the Prime selections to find something uplifting.  I laughed out loud watching John Pinnette:I'm Starvin!  The expression's and voices he uses are so perfectly timed and the situations he jokes about really hit home for me.  I enjoyed it so much I had my husband and later one of my sons watch it and I enjoyed it just as much if not more each time.  If you want a good dose of laughter, you have to sit back and watch the winter blues disappear as you laugh throughout his entire show.",1362355200,,881,4.3090909090909095

2674728,5,B000JJSKZY,"I have to be honest, we haven't watched the DVD yet. We saw it on Netflix and it was so funny that I wanted to share it with others. My parent's don't have the internet and I really want them to see it. You know, laughter is the best medicine and I laughed throughout the comedy routine. My husband put it on and I wasn't really interested but John's voice and his expressions quickly got my attention. I remember it being pretty clean (language) and it didn't have mature content. (it's been six months since I saw it so this is to the best of my memory)
About the seller, the DVD arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised. Great price and Amazon Prime free shipping!",1360368000,,672,4.341269841269841

Like many people I first saw John Pinette on the last episode of ""Seinfeld"" and didn't know who he was, but he made me laugh. Fast forward a few years to ""I'm Starvin'!"" and I feel like I've known him forever. He has the ability to make you laugh using all he has, not just material but hilarious facial expressions, body movement and delivery. If you love comedy, this is a must for your collection.",1358899200,,498,4.252631578947368

I don't know what show those other people were watching who said this was funny, but this obviously wasn't it. If you want to hear 1 hour and 15 minutes of some large guy talking about food, excercise, his fatness and how miserable he is because of it, then this may be the show for you. NOT funny.",1331424000,,472,4.141304347826087
2674749,5,B000JJSKZY,"Rarely do I award 5 stars, but John Pinette earns them with I'm Starvin'.  He started out funny and just kept getting funnier.  Pinette is a big boy and much of his material comes from that; I'm a big girl, so maybe that makes me appreciate his humor more, but this guy is just funny, I don't care who you are!  There is the occasional, appropriately placed, mild to medium profanity but not a bunch of f-bombs.  Definitely worth your time.",1331337600,,440,4.395061728395062

He's one of the seemingly few comedians who sticks to making fun of himself rather than going on long political diatribes.  His comedic timing is spot on, and he makes great use of circular humor.  He doesn't use much profanity either, so if you're looking for a fairly clean comedian he's a good choice.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1322352000,2,508,4.6

John Pinette is my favorite comedian.  He is tears-streaming-down-your-face, having-trouble-breathing-because-you-can't-quit-laughing funny, and YET I can watch him with my 2 teenagers, my husband, my 82 year old father, and everyone else in between.  He appeals to everyone.  He's not mean spirited, he's not crude, he's just funny down to his (well-padded) bones.

And to think this man almost DIDN'T become a comedian... he almost spent his career as an accountant!  Egad. What a waste that would've been!

While he's equally good on this DVD, at least 80% of the material is the same between the two performances. With most comedians, they don't bring out a new DVD unless they actually have new material to put on it.

If you haven't seen I Say Nay Nay, buy either that one or this one, whichever happens to be cheaper. After all, you'll be getting mostly the same material either way. If you already have his other DVD, buying this one will feel like a big rip-off.",1308268800,,672,5.461538461538462

The only negative that I have about this video is that the camera keeps taking full body shots and audience shots.  I'm not one that really wants to see the audience laughing.  But more importantly, a lot of John's comedy is in his facial expressions.  They should have filmed more of it from his waist or knees up.  They have to pull back to get the full body shot, so you miss some of his facial expressions.  Overall, I would purchase this again.  I've watched it several times already.",1298246400,3,574,4.4

 I'm a newcomer to the world of John Pinette. ( Where have I been? Like John himself said in one of his funniest bits [The fabulous  Ewok impersonation] "" I should get out more "". ) The amazing thing is this isn't just a dvd that you watch once, or twice, I've seen it and shared it dozens of times with friends and had those same people ask to borrow it, some of whom bought their own copy.
Many of Mr. Pinette's best bits are on this dvd and because of seeing ""I'm Starvin !"", I've gone on to find more of his great bits on youtube. This may be the funniest guy on the planet. IMHO
Well worth the price... I just may buy another to have on hand when I wear this one down. :-)

2674793,5,B000JJSKZY,"I first heard a John Pinette routine on a satellite radio comedy channel, and of the many comics that I had listened to there, John was the only one with which I was motivated to research further. I viewed some of his routines posted on YouTube, and as I thought, this man is refreshingly funny! I have purchased both of his DVDs, and as others have discovered, much of the material is repeated on both disks, though there are some noticeable differences. If you really like John's material, then you might want to have both DVDs to see how his material has changed, but in my opinion, the ""I'm Starvin'!"" DVD is the better of the two. It seems that in the several years between the release of each disk he has actually fine-tuned his material and delivery for greater effect (my absolute favorite routine on this DVD is ""Touring the World"" about looking for Italian food in France...you can view it on YouTube: [...]). My children have seen both DVDs and they agree as well. You can tell that John is a creative talent because there is quite a bit of drama in his act (he performed in the Broadway production of ""Hairspray"" for two years as Edna Turnblad). Both the ""I Say Nay Nay"" and ""I'm Starvin'!"" DVDs have a featurette of his famous ""Chinese Buffet"" routine from early in his career, but neither is as good as some of the ""Chinese Buffet"" performances posted on YouTube. My favorite is posted here: [...]
...though he is older and has lost a little weight since that era. One thing to point out...John does use some profanity in his I'm Starvin act, not because his material is obscene, but more so to punctuate some of his humor (on par with a PG-13 movie, and he doesn't use the f-word). If you are uncomfortable with having your kids hear an occasional curse, then this disk may not be for you. Personally, I think it is unfortunate that John felt he needed to include the profanity because I think all children would really appreciate John's work (such as they do Bill Cosby's timeless material from the 1960's). In my opinion, John is so gifted that he could easily avoid the use of much of the profanity and he would be just as entertaining. None-the-less, I allowed my three kids (age 10 and up) to watch the DVDs, because I wanted them to appreciate John's talent as much as I do.",1280275200,16,2295,4.492822966507177

2674819,4,B000JJSKZY,"I ordered this DVD after hearing John Pinette on Laugh USA on Sirius.  His ""The Water Park"" made me laugh so hard that I cried.  I literally had to pull over along the side of the road and compose myself before I could drive the rest of the way home that night.  The way he describes being stuck in the giant tube (Nay nay, it was a medium tube at best) pushed me over the top.  When I saw that title was included on the DVD, I quickly placed the order.  I was so disappointed when we all sat down to watch it (after I'd told my whole family how hilarious it was), to find out that the version on the DVD is much abbreviated.  The whole part about having to be ""shot out of the tube"" was left out.  I was sad.  :(

This DVD is a little slow to get started, but the finale about Cold Stone Creamery is hilarious.  I'm still glad I bought it, but now must start my quest to find to entire Water Park routine!",1262822400,3,906,3.955801104972376

I think the only bad language he uses is ""S.O.B."" twice, so it is pretty family friendly which is hard to find in good comedy these days.

I guess that's proof of the dumbing down of America.  I laughed maybe twice during the show; very low brow humor. Over an hour's worth of food related jokes gets old after about ten minutes.

The only down side is that this has about 75% recycled material from his older video ""I say Nay Nay.""  If you already own that one, you can skip this one.  But if I had to choose between the two, this one is more up to date and a little longer.",1212105600,,367,3.8533333333333335

2674872,5,B000JJSKZY,"This John Pinnette DVD ""I'm Starvin"" was EXTREMELY funny !!!  I would recommend it to anyone who has ever dieted, taken a cruise, is overweight or just likes to laugh a lot.  He makes fun of himself in the most hilarious ways, not just about food.  He also discusses people who can't make up their minds in any kind of line up.  There are no 4 letter or obscene words & it is still very funny...for those who think nothing is funny without 4 letter words. I would love to get more of his work if there are any. I think I may get some more of this one as gifts for friends & family  !

While I agree with many other reviewers that John needs to come up with some new material, I do not agree that his material gets old once you know the jokes.  I frequently put on ""I'm Starvin"" when I'm feeling stressed or just have the blahs.  He never ceases to make me laugh to the point of tears - no matter how many times I watch it.  It is also refreshing to listen to a stand up comic that doesn't have to resort to filthy language to get a joke across.  I love John's work!",1200182400,3,588,4.078260869565217

My husband and I will definitely make up our minds about what we want to order before even going in from now on.  John's routine is brought to mind regularly and makes us smile all over again.  My sister-in-law introduced us to John's DVD and we all were laughing so hard we had tears running down our faces. What a refreshing act!  Very funny without resorting to fowl language or attacking anyone.  Good job John!  Keep up the good work!",1199923200,3,712,4.340909090909091

He essentially seems to have just the same routine and material in nearly all of his shows but in this one he has definitely perfected the comic timing and delivery of his stuff. Plus It's not a complete re hash of all his old stuff - he does inject some new material in there - but if you're a die hard Pinette fan you've seen all the material before in his various TV performances over the years.

I still recommend you definitely get this though as he still gets me splitting sides even though I've seen it before.

Can't wait till He comes up with some brand new stuff - One of the best comics around at the moment.",1192579200,3,721,4.135714285714286

I decided to buy this CD as I saw the Comedy Central special one night but missed half of it... It was great as it made me laugh while my husband was away on business trip and I was home alone and feeling down.
I laughed and loved it but wanted to see the whole show.
I bought the CD and hubby and I watched it one night as our ""date night"" and we both had tears of laughter coming down from our eyes.
We had a blast watching John and you won't regret seeing this show as he is a master at making people laugh... He is wonderful and I'm soo happy with the choice of buying this from Amazon as I looked everywhere to find it ( I tried all the ""other discount / dept stores ie: circuit city,best buy, even movie stores in mall) but none of them had John in there list of movies or soundtracks or comedians... such a shame in my opinion but then again - I feel John has the right idea pairing up with Amazon as you can rest assured that you get your order in a timely fashion and I've never had a problem ordering from Amazon..
THANKS JOHN for being with me on a lonely night by myself and also thanks for ALL THE LAUGHS you have given me and hubby and now my parents as I let my parent borrow the CD to watch and they also LOVED IT!
Keep up the awesome work John and THANK YOU!

John Pinette is a genuinely funny man who can make light of even the most mundane situations...even of standing in line!
Whenever my 13 year old nephew comes to visit, I worry about what movies to pick because of ""adult humor"" (why has ""adult"" come to mean ""dirty?""), but I won't have to worry when we watch this DVD.

Since I don't know whos reading this and what you have seen of Johns before, Its difficult to talk about here.  If you have Johns other DVD and show me the buffet  You have a lot of whats on here..... but for a stand up comedy lover like me  It was worth it to get the new stuff and see the old stuff refined a little  Plus that he pokes fun at his time on Broadway doing Hairspray  which is very funny.

Yes, I know that most of this material is recycled from John's long career.  That is why I bought it- kind of a 'best-of'.  Actually, he  didn't perform enough of the Chinese buffet bit for that qualification.

I saw him on ComedyCentral and had to have this.  I've been peeing myself listening to old bits replayed on XM Radio, and saw the tv special / dvd.

Most of his work is not 'dirty', but after watching this with my in-laws, I realized he does swear a few times on the DVD.

I especially liked how he has freshened up some material with new references;  he mentions his time 'in a dress' a few times, (he performed in Hairspray) - and compares his family to the ""March of the Penguins"" as they queue up for cruise ship dining.

I'd buy it again - especially at Amazon's price.",1177286400,4,798,4.295302013422819
2674932,5,B000JJSKZY,"John Pinette is a TRUE comdeian, doesn't use a lot of profanity or vulgarity, and keeps us ROLLING on the floor!

LOVE HIM, we hope he becomes a BIG star!",1174867200,3,154,4.133333333333334
2674933,4,B000JJSKZY,This made all of us laugh.  He's hysterical! I've been passing this DVD around to people at work and we all want to go back and buy all the rest of his cds now...,1174608000,,162,3.764705882352941
2674934,4,B000JJSKZY,"There isn't any cutting edge observation here. But Pinette riffs with engaging, dimpled blitheness about his weight, about food he's enjoyed, about the trials and tribulations of tagging along with slimmer friends to attempt the same exertions they consider jolly good exercise.  He makes his stand-up act a buffet of good humor.

It might be nice to see a heavy comic for once NOT make weight the lynchpin of his/her act. Couldn't a hefty comic stand up there and deliver pointed political humor? It doesn't seem to happen though. But I suppose if your goal is to do character-driven humor, it's only logical to use a distinguishing feature such as weight to define your character. And Pinette does it all good-naturedly, without making himself the ""butt"" of any cruel, put-down jokes.

Pinette has a signature catchphrase that is especially endearing. He'll set up a scenario whose usual outcome he's going to upend by saying, ""Do you think...? Nay, Nay!"" Then he'll set the record straight.

After watching his act, you'll probably feel distanced from whatever negative ""Nay, nays"" may be going on in your life at the time. Instead, it's likely you'll feel heartened to a resounding ""Yea, yea, Hooray!""

Then if you want to see more of Pinette on screen, you can check out the surprisingly good karaoke turn he does in the movie ""Duets.""",1174262400,5,1340,4.911504424778761
2674935,5,B000JJSKZY,"How could you go wrong with the guy who put the Seinfeld clan away.  I remember John from years ago and he was a pretty funny comedian.  It was during the playoff games, was among friends and I said hey turn on Comedy Central this guy John Pinette is on.  Everyone was up for it, we turn it on (it was about quarter way in when we turned it on)and after about ten minutes we could not catch a breath from laughing so hard.  So I had to own the video, I've lent it to colleagues at work, friends, and the results were all the same.  Belly-aching laughter.  The best part about this stand-up routine is the fact that there is very little potty language in it, so you can play it in front of children and they will probably miss those couple of words from laughing so hard themselves.",1173830400,5,781,4.173333333333333
2674936,4,B000JJSKZY,My wife and our older teenage girls watched this together and laughed our heads off. I enjoyed it accept for the occasional language. There were only a few swear words and no use of the Lords name in vain. The content was clean and full of laughs. Gene Burley,1173657600,2,259,4.3061224489795915
2674937,5,B000JJSKZY,"John Pinette again at his best. John is one of the funniest and non vulgar comedians I enjoy. You will not be dissapointed in this. From camping to cruise ships and every thing in between. John shows that we need to laugh at ourselves and life. Who needs to be serious all the time.

My wife bought it for me for valantines day and I enjoy it each time I watch it. If you want to laugh and forget about your problems or life for 90 minutes, then buy it. Guranteed laughs!!",1173398400,3,472,4.130434782608695

2674944,5,B000JJSKZY,"All in all, I was pleased with the quality of the DVD.  Had no problems with it whatsoever.  I was slightly disappointed with his routine.  It was apparent that he was away from stand-up for a while because some of his material did not seem to flow as before his break.

That said, he is still one hilarious entertainer!",1173398400,3,320,4.372881355932203
2674945,4,B000JJSKZY,"John always puts on a great performance, however, much of the new DVD is old material. Nonetheless, super funny. I seen him live in february in Laughlin, Nevada, and there was more new material in that performance than on the new DVD. This DVD is still worth the price even if you have the first DVD he put out because what new material he did put into the new DVD warrants what you pay for it.",1173398400,,394,4.197368421052632
2674946,5,B000JJSKZY,"John Pinette has provided hard laughter for my family repeatedly with this DVD.  I have watched it approximately 8 times, and never fail to laugh at the same jokes again and again.  I bought 3 copies; one for myself, one for my father, and one for my son.  I sat and watched it with each member of my family at seperate times, and not one person who viewed it failed to laugh until the tears flowed. John Pinette touches something in each person; from crazy family members to waiting in lines to stores and their member cards.  My daughter and I could be in the middle of a conversation, and one us suddenly starts up with one of his bits... and before you know it we're laughing all over again.  Her friend eventually asked to watch it because she wanted to know what we were always laughing about.  She laughed so hard she had to take a break so she could catch her breath.

I can't recommend this DVD strong enough.  It was the best money I've spent on a DVD for a long time.  I'm even ordering more for friends and family.  I hope I get to watch them watching this... I love to watch people laugh until they cry!",1173312000,3,1116,4.246445497630332

The reason I gave it four stars is because he repeates a lot of his routines as well. But if you have never seen John Pinette preform his stand up befoe, or if you just enjoy seeing him make fun of all the classic stuff, then this dvd is freakin awsome.

One day, however, I was channel surfing and briefly stopped while John Pinette was doing his bit.  I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe through his entire routine.  I was hooked. I ordered this DVD as well as another DVD titled ""I Say Nay Nay"" and a CD titled ""Show Me The Buffet"".  This DVD is the most recent he has cut and it is the absolute best.  I never get tired of watching it.  You like the guy from the moment he steps on stage.  His facial expressions are priceless.  His entire routine is a nonstop laughfest centered around his weight problems, his love of food - especially buffets - and how much he hates to wait in line at a buffet.  This guy is unbelievably hilarious and still manages to keep it clean.  This DVD is one of my prized possessions.",1173312000,,885,4.303030303030303

Now if even if you have never heard of John Pinette's work this video is worth the purchase as I believe you will watch it more than once and be letting your friends in on this fantastic comic.

Pinette's comedic sense of timing, and his ability to say things it seems we all think about put him in the same class as such greats as Robin Williams, Jonathan Winters, or George Carlin.

He plays not only to his live audience but to the camera as well brining you a little closer to his world, this performance is a real fun ride please enjoy.",1172102400,,657,4.368852459016393

His recording of I Say Nay Nay (which I could not find as a downloadable movie), had much of the same material, BUT it was delivered masterfully. In the recording ""I'm Starvin'"" it seems that his producers must have said, ""John, deliver your lines faster so we can get more in, in an hour."" Timing is so important in comedy. If you don't pause and wait for the audience at appropriate times, then you are just reading lines. Oh, all the great jokes and gags are there, but they come off flat, like a glass of Coke that sat out all day.
