8233368,4,B000YKYT62,"And that is mainly the unanswered question, one of many as this documentary of about one hundred and thirty minutes plays out. The feature performances of the talented group, while there are only four, are very good audibly and visually, but not shown in their entirety. As far as some unanswered questions that I have would include Cass getting hit on the head with a pipe while in the virgin Islands,which, according to every member of the group, including Cass, that enabled her voice to reach a tone and a half higher! Of course, all one would have to do is listen to Cass's wide vocal range when she sang with the Big Three,to dispel this concocted story. Michelle herself said on another interview, ""She ALWAYS had the range!"" but you know, this was at a time in the sixties when everything was a drug and alcohol fueled ZOO with free admission to all. Irregardless of what one chooses to believe, or not believe, the interviews with the surviving group members still provides some insightful and humorous moments. The Mamas And The Papas were definately in a class of their own, and still are. Many groups have tried but have failed to conquer the perfect harmonies they created. Watch this biography with some old friends, and stir up controversy of of your own. I did, and it was fun!",1271030400,3,1293,4.650655021834061

8233370,3,B000YKYT62,"I for one am a big fan of their music but personally the group is a well known train wreck. The great things about the group are quickly overshadowed but John's drug use and 3/4's of the group were moral reprobates. The Mamas and the Papas are a great case study of how wonderful talent and hope is quickly ruined by substance abuse and poor behavior. How many rock bios tell the same sad story?

I have mixed emotions about this DVD. If you are a big fan you will want it but how many times can you view the last 45 minutes of it?",1261094400,,531,4.057142857142857
8233371,4,B000YKYT62,"As I write this, MacKenzie Phillips's controversial confession is swirling and the negative press is coming down, mostly on her. Never on her father, who certainly never did anything wrong, cuz, you know, he was a genius...

Straight Shooter purports to be about the group, but concentrates most on John Phillips. The entire DVD is worth it for the marvelous editing of the story about ending his marriage to take up with a 16 year old. We see his (now) ex-wife, growling about Michelle, ""She was ... brazen."" Just when I was thinking what a nasty, bitter old woman this was, the show cut to Michelle Phillips, cheerily saying, (paraphrasing) ""I saw HER and I knew it was only a matter of time before she was gone, and __I__ was at his side."" Then, just as cheerily, she describes cheating on John with Denny while she knew Cass was in love with Denny, and my jaw hit the floor.

That's (to use the writer's cliche) not TELLING you about a person, but SHOWING you. Brilliant.

The backstory of the group is good, but if you are a fan you already know most of the facts presented. Get this DVD for the interviews.",1254009600,4,1112,4.4950495049504955

The Mamas & The Papas: Straight Shooter is a very good documentary of The Mamas & The Papas and their history; but I must agree with another reviewer who notes that a lot of time is spent on John Phillips and the minute details of his drug taking days while not enough time is spent on Cass Elliott, Michelle Phillips and Denny Doherty after the group disbanded. Indeed, the focus on John Phillips is quite something when you consider we even get footage of several of his family members which is something we don't get for the other members of the group. On the other hand, the three bonus features do a good job of filling in many of the blanks that were left in the film; and that's what leads me to give this four and one-half stars. In addition, the documentary moves along at a very good pace; I was never bored.

All in all, there's very little significant history about the group that you'll need to know after you read the lengthy editorial review Amazon posted halfway down this product page. However, there are some extra stories well worth telling that flesh out the story of this group; and I'm not going to spoil much for you by telling you all of them here. There are things like the tale of how they initially met Cass Elliott, how Cass was able to suddenly sing higher notes than ever before, Cass contributing to the group and her career after she left the group. In addition, the archival footage is really special; you've got to see it to truly appreciate the value of this film. The footage of the revived Mamas & The Papas at the end of the film is very well done as well. I also liked the footage of The Monterey Pop Festival during the ""summer of love;"" and I learned a lot about how John Phillips did so much to make that happen.

As for those bonus features: Chronicles has Michelle Phillips tells us her memories of Cass Elliott and Cass' history with The Mugwumps and The Big 3. Michelle also talks about how the group shot to stardom and more; parts of this come from the main portion of the documentary but a lot does come as true-blue extra info. Denny Doherty recalls how he met John Phillips and began to work with him as part of another bonus feature; and the third bonus includes commentary from documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker who made a terrific film about The Monterey Pop Festival.

It may seem as if everything has been given away and that there's nothing new to find if you watch this film, especially with the editorial review above. However, I can't tell you in words about the experience you have when you watch this film. The nostalgic effect is terrific; both the interview footage and the archival footage impress me greatly. This is a great film for folk rock fans, people who like classic rock from the mid 1960s and, of course, people who want to learn about The Mamas & The Papas as well as their fans.",1251417600,,2872,4.444022770398482
8233373,4,B000YKYT62,Brought me back to the 60's to enjoy that wonderful sound of Mama Cass.  Thankyou,1230336000,,81,4.4
8233374,4,B000YKYT62,"I bought this originally on VHS in 1988. The bonus interview footage taped back in 1987 makes it worthwhile to have. The extra unedited interviews with Michelle, Denny & John are essential to see and hear . Each of them in their own words recount and elaborate more of the history of The Mamas & The Papas than was in the original video. It's about 30 minutes extra interviews only that is added to the original video.

  I always had issues with this video concentrating more on John Phillips' life, than on each one of the members. It does tell the story of The Mamas & The Papas through interviews , television appearances & photos. It's a good documentary, but it could have been great. It traces John's life from birth to 1987 , and the group's history as well. Cass , Michelle & Denny are shortchanged and not covered in depth, as John's story is. The early history of the pre-Mamas and Papas groups that each member was in is only briefly covered. The Mugwumps, the very important group that Cass & Denny had in 1964 is not even discussed or even a photo of the band shown! What an oversight that is.  When made in 1988, the video ended with the horrific stories of John's drug abuse, John's version of a "" New "" Ms & Ps in the studio and his rehabilitation. All of the events that have happened since then - the groups' induction into the R&R Hall of Fame, the passing of both John and Denny, Michelle's acting career - are all convieniently summed up by a simple scroll at the end of the DVD. That's so the producers didn't have to spend any extra money on new production or added footage. What a shame that the original video was not re-edited to feature extra footage. Again, just to save the expense of doing a new re-editing job, which the history of The Mamas & The Papas deserves.

 As for the footage, there are some great clips of the group from American Bandstand, Where The Action Is, Ed Sullivan , and others. There are one clip each for The Journeymen, The Big 3 and a very rare performance of The New Journeymen featuring John, Michelle & Denny. Also of interest is the 1977 clip of them reunited on Denny's CBC TV show that is great to see. However, all the clips are not of the full performance. Also, Cass' life and her untimely death are only very briefly shown. Such a shame, as this should be the definitive chronicle of the group. We don't really need to see an interview of John Phillips' neighbor interviewed in 1987 talking about the condition of his home in the history of the group.

 This DVD is essential for a history of the group, but you must add the VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC documentary done in 1998 [ but never released on VHS or DVD ] and the CALIFORNIA DREAMIN': THE MUSIC OF THE MAMAS & THE PAPAS  DVD for a more complete history of this important group in the history of rock and roll.",1205107200,19,2826,4.357414448669202
