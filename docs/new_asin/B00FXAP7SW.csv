8619126,2,B00FXAP7SW,"This review concerns the MR. FAT-W VIDEO version of this film.  The movie itself is a fairly entertaining B detective film, however, don't expect it to hold up well when compared to the earlier Philo Vance films in the series, such as those staring William Powell.  I had heard that the public domain DVD's sold by MR. FAT were of excellent quality, especially when compared to other public domain releases by other companies.  But in this case the DVD is of poor quality.  The sound is muddy, and the picture is very flawed, it is obvious that no effort has been made to restore the film.  The poor quality is not acceptable especially when you consider the price, currently at $14.99!  There are other public domain films, fully restored, and some on Blu Ray, that are much cheaper and of far superior quality.  A public domain movie, of this quality, is something usually found for about $5 or less.  I do applaud MR. FAT-W for making some obscure films available, but they need to either improve the quality of their offerings or dramatically lower their price.",1406592000,5,1065,4.688172043010753
8619127,3,B00FXAP7SW,"This is a 1947 attempt to use a detective name that was well-known in its time, but none of the characteristics of Philo Vance are in this character. He is really closer to Boston Blackie since the police are suspicious of him as a shady character and consider him a suspect. He is a private investigator and his sidekick is likeable. There are many suspects and guns that shoot from windows and/or curtains all over the place. Bodies are falling everywhere. It is an enjoyable tale but not as complicated as a real Philo Vance story. I would say if you are a fan of Perry Mason (as done by Raymond Burr) you would enjoy this one.",1387238400,7,630,4.3931623931623935
