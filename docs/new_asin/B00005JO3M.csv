7941574,5,B00005JO3M,"This is one of the greatest documentaries that I've ever watched. I would think that many people would say something about this, but it just goes to show the extent of Africa's marginalization in today's world. It's about LG Dallaire's journey to Rwanda with his wife for the anniversary of the genocide, to better explain the genocide and also for closure. It has interviews from some high-profile people, LG Dallaire, his wife, an author, a CBC journalist, LG Dallaire's assistant, giving accounts of the genocide. LG Dallaire talked about his suicide attempt. He also talked about his post, his book, PTSD, how he was ignored by the Western world when he needed more troops, medicine, food, etc to assist the Rwandans. Viewers get to see Senator Dallaire be the amazing, extraordinary individual that he is. He is shown in church with his wife. He is also shown giving interviews and looking at some skulls with his wife. They showed one of his sons. Clinton is shown making an I-didn't-know speech, which is ridiculous because he knew about the genocide. There is usually a disregard for African lives, but not from LG Dallaire. He is not just concerned about Africa, he believes that where a person lives should not determine whether a person lives or dies. He is a man of high integrity who reminds me of my dad in the sense that he is highly compassionate. His family is very lucky to have him. There are many good interviews. The special features are amazing. It is nice to watch him read passages from his book (Shake Hands with the Devil). The commentaries are very good, the pictures are also good, and there's a short version for students. This is a documentary that we all need to watch because it's very amazing. I highly recommend this documentary to everyone.",1305417600,5,1775,4.766233766233766
7941575,5,B00005JO3M,This film is an excellent adaptation on the Romeo Dallaire's book. It realistically conveys the depth of the genocide without being too graphic. More important is its focus on the frustration and hopelessness associated with trying to remain neutral yet effective in the midst of an entire nation in conflict. I highly recommend it as a teaching tool...perfect for the classroom.,1297036800,2,379,5.229508196721311
7941576,5,B00005JO3M,"This  documentary is a masterpiece. After you see this doc you will be in need of some seriouse soul sarching. General Romeo Dallaire's journey back to Rawanda ten years after the slaughter of 800,000 people is gripping from start to finish. If you have seen ""Hotel Rawanda"" and ""Sometimes in April"" you will find this above and beyond what you have already seen and felt. Just my opinion of course.",1250812800,5,399,4.7

7941578,5,B00005JO3M,"After seeing this film, I rushed out to purchase Gen. Dallaire's book with the same title. While reading it, I saw this documentary twice more on the Documentary channel and was struck by how much the film changes with each viewing and after learning more and more of the background to the film.

This film, in retrospect, seems like an appendix to the book. It covers a fair bit about the war in Rwanda but more in summary style and as a tour of affected areas than a straight-up documentary outlining the history of the conflict. The film spends a great deal of time focusing on Dallaire's role in post-war trials, hearings, and reconciliation and on the impact of the war on Dallaire personally and its survivors in Rwanda. All of those matters were largely glossed over in the conclusion to the book, making this film a very important addition to its readers.

Both this film and the book are incredibly emotional, considering the position of their creator. The frank and open discussion of the wounds of war and, more specifically, post traumatic stress disorder, are eye opening and extremely relevant today.",1184198400,10,1114,4.796875
7941579,5,B00005JO3M,"Although I haven't purchased this DVD and did see nearly the entire program. With the pending film of Imaculee Illabigiza's experience likely to made or come out with documentary compliments. I remember about the rivers in Rwanda being so full of bodies and running red and wondering why not a single Western even tried to do anything. This film, complete with many interviews of Romeo Dallaire and other including Paul Kagame (now President of Rwanda) goes into more depth about what happened in those early days as well as final ones of the genocide. I recommend this film and hope that its viewed and understood why it must be seen by all who are mature enough to watch it. There are a few graphic still photos but nothing outrageous. What is more disturbing is the lack of action and even 10 years later the evidence that the Western nations still do not care about Africa. (See Darfur.)",1179187200,5,891,4.681528662420382
7941580,5,B00005JO3M,"Teachers in history educate the Western world's youth about the atrocities of World War II.  These lessons are visually illustrated, and occasionally depicted, through films that teachers bring to the lesson, which presents the horrid concentration camps and the genocide of the Jews in these camps such as Auswitch, Buchenwald, and Treblinka.  One documentary that depicts the cruelty of the genocide of World War II is Night and Fog (1955) by Alain Resnais.  Through the decades teaching about the atrocities in the concentration camps continues to echo through the minds of the youth, as the word rings ""Let this never happen again.""

Canadian Lieutenant General Romo Dallaire wishes that the wisdom learned from World War II was applied when he took the command of United Nations mission in Rwanda in 1993.  The situation in Rwanda steadily worsened when Dallaire arrived to Rwanda, as radio programs continued to hoist prejudice and hatred toward the Tutsi and the French were arming the country's troops consisting of Hutus.  The majority religion in Rwanda, Catholicism, disregarded the hatred and let it continue as the instability in the country turned it into a butcher shop after the killing of the president, which was blamed upon the Tutsi.

During Dallaire's command, he tried numerous times to convince the United Nations to act before it was too late.  However, the leading world was more concerned about the war in former Yugoslavia while the public drew their interest through the many news stations to O.J. Simpson's infamous small gloves.  Abandoned at his post with an insufficient number of soldiers to handle a murderous rampage that took place in Rwanda, Dallaire could only do one thing, watch and try to save as many as he could.

One scene introduces the audience to a place where ten Belgian soldiers were murdered.  Dallaire who was there did not act on the slaughter killings of these soldiers, as he considered it too dangerous for the mission and it could put all of his present men at risk.  Yet, the Belgian senator of Rwanda had the stomach to complain that Dallaire did not act to save the ten soldiers that were killed at the outpost.  This supports the notion that the Belgians did not consider the 800,000 Rwandan's that were brutally murdered by machetes and guns, as the Belgians withdrew their troops from the country.  Besides did the Canadians not aid the Belgians in their fight for freedom during World War II?

The story is thoughtfully told through Dallaire's personal struggle to cope with the post-traumatic stress that he suffers from due to the time in Rwanda, as he returns to the country of his haunting nightmares.  He vividly remembers the smell of rotting corpses, the view of mutilated women and children, and the cries of people being butchered in the night.  These events continued for over 100 days when he was in command of the United Nations' outpost in Rwanda while the United Nations' Cabinet did nothing to prevent the brutal killings.  Instead the Western World repeated history, as they turned their backs to the people of Rwanda just as they did to the Jews in the Evian Conference of 1938 by closing their borders to German-Jewish refugees.

Sadly, this documentary provides an image of the atrocities in Rwanda, which still seem to be swept under the rug in the Western World.  Sure, it is recognized today, but the Western World does not want to talk about its blood stained hands, as it is too difficult, maybe because of guilt.  Nonetheless, it is a story that should be told and that unfortunately took place in a remote part of the world compared to the Western World.  Dallaire raises his voice and speaks out, the way he experienced it, while others tried to take potshots at him.  Ultimately, Shake Hands with the Devil offers a tragic story that should be a tool to help educate the world of the atrocities, and maybe this time the Western World can get it right when they say, ""Let this never happen again.""",1112745600,22,3988,4.866863905325443
7941581,5,B00005JO3M,"""Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire"" begins showing the picture of a person, the image pock-marked, which turns into clouds.  This is a documentary that combines news footage with interviews.  The emotional juggernaut that this film takes you through is something that everyone must feel, must go through, and it still won't come close to what Dallaire felt back then right up to today.  The anger you feel towards Western bureaucracy, from the UN for vastly underfunding the mission, to the Catholic Church, the French, and every other Western State, is only overwhelmed by the grief and helplessness that one can't help but feel; for the Rwandans, and for those who tried to help them.  And the guilt that many Westerners can't help but feel--or should have no choice but to feel--for not paying attention to what was going on, for not putting pressure on our governments to do anything.  The Tutsies told the Western soldiers and reporters that they were to be killed, but we just didn't care.  OJ was more important to the mass population.  What does that say about Western Society?",1110067200,5,1109,4.867021276595745
