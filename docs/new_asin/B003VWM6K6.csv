8673178,5,B003VWM6K6,"Einsteinabot Multiplication helps teach children of all ages their multiplication time tables. Each multiplication table is a music video that features a classical music masterpiece remake to danceable hip hop drums, narrated by a robot puppet. The robot voices may be difficult to understand at some places. However, ALL the numbers are animated on the screen for clear VISUAL understanding. This DVD was made in America and I watch it all the time myself! I love EINSTEINABOT!!!!",1282608000,,481,5.259740259740259
