Although the political references now need some footnoting (and a bit of apology to students who do not share Bly's political perspective for the stridency of some of his comments), the engaging presentation of the differences between masculine and feminine communication styles remains valuable.",1395273600,,343,5.351851851851852
7849901,5,6303504299,"It was great seeing/hearing these two remarkable characters in conversation--after having read their works in print.  There's quite a bit of humor and mutual support despite the differences in gender, concerns, perspectives, and styles.  It's short though--less than an hour of actual conversation.  Their sincerity is obvious.  This is an enjoyable as well as valuable item and is a great way to introduce someone to the intracacies of gender differences, gender-specific styles/needs, and improved communications between men & women.  The characters are so delightful, I'm rounding up my score.  Enjoy!",1118016000,,604,5.655555555555556
7849902,4,6303504299,"I'll be brief.  I show this video in my classroom to facilitate thinking.  This is a good example of 'personalities' dicussing personalities.  The conversation focuses on gender, but also becomes a good dialog on postmodern society.  The good points in this video go far beyond the bad.  I usually turn the video off when Robert breaks out his musical instrument (then we read his words outloud).  His style is rarely appreciated at the community college level.",969494400,2,461,5.0
