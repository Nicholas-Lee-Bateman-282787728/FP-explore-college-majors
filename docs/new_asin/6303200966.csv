7840892,4,6303200966,"Plot:  The Enterprise is exploring a solar system whose planets go through terrible geologic activity to the point of tearing the planet apart.  Wesley Crusher is given command of finding out (and possibly stopping) this solar systematic crisis.  Meanwhile, Data picking up signals from one of the planets and suddenly recieves these words.  ""Is anybody out there?""  Data, naturally replies, ""Yes.""  (Not like he would have said ""no"".)  Well, that pretty much blows apart following the Prime Directive in this case, so our heroes sit down and debate what to do next.  It's either:  (1) Follow the Prime Directive, break contact with the species, and watch them go extinct or (2), forget the Prime Directive and save the planet (and also keep fans from destroying their TV's after seeing the episode).

As far as the whole Prime Directive thing goes, you have to ask the obvious, ""How can a man-made law be absolute since man is evolving?"" (according to Star Trek).  Since Star Trek tends to act as if God is irrelevent (or non-existant), then there is no basis for absolute truth.  Hence the reason for the dilemma that our heroes face in this episode.

Great points are though that they do save the day, the brief friendship of Data and Sarjenka, and watching Picard ride an Arabian horse.",1158364800,,1290,4.835616438356165
7840893,5,6303200966,"Sarjenka cries for help
This episode is one your showcases everyone's favorite android, Commander Data.
He hears a cry for help from his workstation and the Prime Directive is held under a microscope. While Picard is pondering as to help this poor kid, Data continues to receive transmissions for help.  It would have been very cold if Picard decided not to break policy...which is what the show does every time.  I can't for a minute believe the fiction Prime Directive when it's broken all the time when it suits the interests of Starfleet....I know ... it's only a TV show...
There are lots of good special effects in this one. The deteriorating planet of Sarjenka and the scenes between Data and Sarjenka will bring a tear to the eye in the most jaded of fans.  I recommend this one.",1017532800,,787,4.64748201438849
7840894,4,6303200966,"Yet another one of those infuriating Prime Directive episodes where Starfleet rules demand that an entire of being die because it would be wrong for them to find out there are beings zipping around the cosmos in starships.  The Enterprise is studying violent geothermal activity on planets in the Selcundi Drema system.  While Wesley is put in charge of planetary mineral surveys, Data fiddles with the sensor array and comes across a radio transmission from a little girl on Drema IV named Sarjenka.  When the child asks the fatal question, ""Is anybody out there?"" Data answers ""Yes.""  This pretty much violates every rule in the book, but before Picard can get away from the planet, which is about to self-destruct, Sarjenka makes a plaintive call for help.  Suddenly this changes everything.
What redeems this episode is the friendship between Data and Sarjenka, which is rather endearing.  For some reason I have always liked the way children interacted with Data, much the same way I get a kick out of Naomi Wildmon and Seven of Nine on Voyager.  No rationale explanation available, sorry.  In ""Pen Pals"" I am perfectly content to let Picard stew in his own juices as to how to save Sarjenka's planet without letting anybody who lives there have a clue as to what is happening, although I tend to think all those beings might turn to a theological rather than a scientific explanation that might alter their destinies a bit. Besides, never argue with an android with a positronic brain.  As somebody said once upon a time, not playing God is just another way of playing God.",972432000,,1579,4.818518518518519
7840895,3,6303200966,"Data breaks Starfleet first contact protocol, talks to scarey orange child; Wesley saves planet. Picard rides a horse. Enterprise rides off into sunset.
Okay; so it's not THAT bad. I find this episode of TNG charming  because it explores the fact that sometimes, Data's ethical programming is  a lot more ""ethical"" than Starfleet's Prime Directive. I mean,  when Data is faced with the prospect of watching his friend Sarjenka's  planet die, he acts. Do any of the PEOPLE act? Not until the android forces  the issue.
I found myself wondering what would happen if the humanoid  Starfleet officers were faced with a Final Solution type problem? Would  they sit around and analyse it and endlessly babble about the Prime  Directive while millions died? Data would size up the situation, decide  This Is Wrong and take action. Says a lot about ""humanity."" And  that's the whole POINT.
Not as good or as well-written as Measure of a  Man or Data's Day-- but worth owning just for the scene where Sarjenka  takes one look at Troi, moves behind Data for protection and calmly says  ""Leave me alone."" We're talking this is one smart scarey orange  child. She knows where HER bread is buttered!",951004800,7,1186,4.835820895522388
