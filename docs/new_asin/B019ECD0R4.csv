8744942,3,B019ECD0R4,"Swung takes place in Glasgow, Scotland and focuses on David (Owen McDonnell), an unemployed graphic designer and divorcee at a low point in his life. Hes in a new relationship with a journalist, Alice (Elena Anaya), but their love life is on shaky ground, and both begin to investigate ways to spice things up. After David logs on to an adult website promising swinging fun, Alice finds out, is a bit taken aback, but decides the swinging lifestyle might both make a good subject for her magazine and a way to pep up their romantic lives.

After a stimulating encounter with two swingers adds the missing zing to their relationship, they decide to expand their sexual boundaries and explore even more intimacy with strangers.

David is motivated by voyeurism, which turns him on, as well as erectile dysfunction in the bedroom. Alice sees swinging as both a way to advance her professional life and create excitement in her sexual relationship with David. Both sincerely want to improve their relationship, so they embark on their sexual journey motivated by the desire to make each other happy. They aren't merely out for thrills.

Elizabeth McGovern (Downton Abbey) has a small role as Dolly, a white-wigged madam who hosts swinging parties. She is both touching and funny as she guides David and Alice into the scene.

The film attempts to be a serious look at the contemporary swinging scene while also incorporating comic moments. It shows that swinging has its pitfalls and is often difficult to deal with emotionally, even for very open-minded participants. David and Alices adventures in unfamiliar territory are characterized by curiosity, awkwardness, and embarrassment as they become intimate with strangers.",1527206400,2,1719,5.106761565836299
