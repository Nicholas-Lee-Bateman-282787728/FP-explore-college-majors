5697040,5,B00C888NFQ,"i watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes and also read the novels. little was i expecting that he would be resurrected for uk tv as a much younger man, at the start of his career. and i certainly wasn't expecting to like it as much or more than the original series! but indeed i do.  this is absolutely first rate in every single episode. shaun evans is wonderful as morse.

a smart decision they made was to make his mentor, detective Thursday, every bit as fascinating as Morse. this part is played by one of my very favorite actors from THE THICK OF IT, roger allam.  allam played peter on that show and his deadpan humor was priceless. they couldn't have picked a better actor for Morse's mentor.  i enjoy Thursday much more than i ever enjoyed lewis as morse's partner.

much like the uk show GEORGE GENTLY, this show also benefits by being set back in time, the sixties i believe.

each mystery is very complex and morse brings to it all of his erudite abilities, which are wholly lacking by the rest of the force. no one lacks this ability more than the chief of the station, a man solely interested in the tried and true of old time police work.

if you have not watched this show yet and you are a fan of UK mysteries, you really need to start watching it now.

I finally caved in though, and aside from the fact that young Morse doesn't look much like what a young Morse should, everything else is great.  The actor playing young Morse does a fantastic job, and it really does seem like the mannerisms and behavior are in line with what a ""young Morse"" would be like, and that's where it really counts.",1519948800,2,441,4.432098765432099

Every police procedural trope - from the misunderstood genius protagonist to the superior officer who doesnt get it to the damsel in distress to the sudden twist that NO VIEWER COULD POSSIBLY GUESS and what's the fun in that? - is trotted out. Nothing original, nothing new, nothing special. In other words, boring and predictable.

5697078,5,B00C888NFQ,"This is a great little show. I didn't anticipate enjoying it near as much as I have.
This is about Inspector Morse but as a young man who is just beginning his career. As he learns to navigate the people on the force and use his skills to piece out a mystery he learns much. Additionally, there is a little bit of a mystery that keeps cropping up - who was Inspector Morse unable to save? What is the secret in his past?

There is a lead detective that is interesting and helps Inspector Morse learn to navigate the force. There is a head detective that does not particularly like Morse because he wants everything to be neat and tidy and easy to solve. These two characters are believable and understandable. In addition, these two characters help move the plot along and make the show much more interesting than just one young man who observes everything and figures out the mystery.

The background music is excellent and only adds to the 'feel' of the show.",1510012800,,961,4.485714285714286

Shawn Evans is terrific as Morse, a young detective who didn't quite fit in during his college days at Oxford and now, several years later, doesn't quite fit in as a detective, albeit a brilliant one, who has returned to Oxford as a member of the local police. I love the way you see small,seemingly unrelated snippets in the beginning of the episode and little by little Morse puts them together to solve the case.

5697100,5,B00C888NFQ,"Absolutely first class entertainment whether you measure by TV or Film standards.  Such a pleasure to watch a series where the writing is excellent, the acting is outstanding and the production spot on.

I do remember watching some of the original Morse with John Thaw and they were wonderful but if anything, I think I might even prefer Endeavour.  Shaun Evans is quite brilliant as the young Morse (yes, I agree he doesn't really look like a young John Thaw, but it doesn't matter) and Roger Allam.. well he's one of the most accomplished and outstanding Shakespearean actors on the British stage today and his performance in this is, as one would expect, the same.

I have to comment that this, as with most British TV detective shows is far more authentic than the gun toting, cgi ridden, flash flash flash of the American cop shows where it seems the police rely on guns and forensic evidence and not much on their wits.  I'm sure that in the US, where I live, real detectives rely on their wits more than is ever shown on cop shows.  Authenticity is so much more appreciated, at least by me, than action just for the sake of it.

I just finished watching ""Fugue"". the second episode and it was compelling, fantastic entertainment.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the series and am so glad it's here to watch.  Don't miss it if you enjoy British shows or just excellent film and theatre.",1502496000,5,1396,4.57429718875502
5697101,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have to admit, the story lines are not what kept me watching the original Morse or now, Endeavour. The magical ambience that is woven around the classic British countryside and its great edifices, accompanied by the thrilling musical scores, create an atmosphere of escape. It is truly like stepping into another world for a time, alas, a world that does not exist, as I found on my trip to England this year. The acting is superb, of course, and the characters beautifully developed. Shaun Evans and John Thaw also share one compelling characteristic, that indefinable ""charisma."" Both men were born with it in abundance. The older Morse shone out of his crotchety character. No personality fault or self-pity party of his role could dampen his irresistible attractiveness. And now the young Endeavour is just as attractive and intriguing. The cause the seems to be a combination of intelligence, superior acting, and well, that indefinable something that separates the two Morses from duller men like Kevin Whateley. Now, I always thought Whately did a very fine job in his role as Morse's sidekick. He is a pretty good actor himself. But, no fault of his own (it's just an accident of birth), his person (and his series) are a definite second to both the young Morse and older Morse series. I cried when Morse and then John Thaw died. I felt foolish but I did cry. And I expect to become just as attached to Shaun Evans.",1502409600,7,1425,4.77327935222672

5697104,5,B00C888NFQ,"Episode 1 begins with a terribly young and naive Morse, who seems clearly at a loss with the work society around him.  Not at all like the steely eyed curmudgeon Morse with a lions mane of white hair.  I am very impressed with the arc each episode has in leading us to who Morse was in the original series.  Shaun Evans is perfection in his portrayal of a bright eyed and highly intelligent lad that evolves subtly each episode as he receives considerable knocks.  By the end of Season Two he carries and masks the dark scars as effortlessly as John Thaw.  It's truly one of the best progressions of a lead character out there.  All working on this series are to be commended for the brilliant writing/acting/production,  and faithfulness to the Morse mythology.",1501545600,,762,4.641791044776119

However, you don't need to be a devotee of Inspector Morse or Inspector Lewis to be captivated by Endeavor.  Shaun Evans is masterful as Morse.  (I love learning how Morse earned his limp.)  Roger Allam as DI Thursday is exceptional.  Anton Lesser's Chief Superintendent Bright is brilliant.  Endeavor must do Colin Dexter (original novels) proud.  Although publicly stating he would not appear in Endeavor as he did in Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis, there is at least one Dexter Spotting.  Also I have to give a nod to the absolutely beautiful cars.  Morse's (John Thaws) 1960 burgundy Jaguar Mk II is very much his signature in the original series.  Very appropriately DI Thursday has a 1959 black Jaguar Mk I.  Also there are appearances by an Alvis TD21, a Hillman Minx, several Rover saloons, among many others.

To me, it is everything that Sherlock should have been. Personally, I find Sherlock to be all smoke and games and incredibly predictable. Several of these episodes had me guessing until the very end and even those that didn't weren't so obnoxious as Sherlock often is. It is extremely well cast and acted, has a pleasant soundtrack, and seems to be very true-to-the-times.

Warning - Even though it is better than Sherlock, there are still a few scenes/scenarios that are completely preposterous. The most egregious of these scenes is, unfortunately, a season-ending so I won't spoil it for you here but just be warned. :) Also, there is some language, sex references, etc. that might not be appropriate for younger viewers so make sure to preview before sharing with your family. :)",1497571200,,913,4.890322580645162

5697124,2,B00C888NFQ,"I am not impressed. On the good side., the cinematography is terrific and shows the lovely and unique buildings, monuments and streets to excellent advantage. His boss, Inspector Thursday, is a likeable, friendly, supportive, and wise character but he seems a little simplistic, but one is glad he is in the picture. ! The young Morse is somewhat bewildered to see slightly older women eyeing him with interest and smiles. That's good. Leave the sound off so you can enjoy the architecture..
No one seems to enjoy themselves, except at the happy home of fatherly, dependable Inspector Thursday (This is all very well - it is nice to have a liikeable, happy family somewhere). However, you don't get the idea that Morse actully gets pleasure from classical music, whereas it is almost a recrring character in the Morse series. Even the writers of Endeavour see it it as some arcane pursuit, and we hear it playing as the detectives uncover one of several grisly, highly improbably murder scens. The young Endeavour, initially a teetotaler, eventually takes up drinking because it is everywhere and by Series 2, Thursday is tlelig him he has a drinking problem. The actual Morse liked real ale and would drink it at lunch and in the afternoon, socially and because he claimed to do his best thinking with it. Endeavour's drinking is portrayed as would the Christian Temperance Unions skewered by W.C. Fields - a foul practice he turns to in attempts to soothe his seeting, twisted, yearning, suffering soul ( (melodrama and cheap pyschology again).. Not much fun there. No wit except nastly sneering by male colleagues, who seem nasty or dimwitted, or mocking by self-contained young women much more in command of the situation than naive Endeavour.
 Unfortunately  many charactters seem simplistic, either wholly good or wholly bad. The characters and plots in Endeavour. are exaggerated and hard to believe, as if the public wants spectacle and horror, not the character development and actual thoughtful reconstructions and false leads followed that occur in the original Morse books.  For example, there have been 154 serial killers,wprldwide, total, in the 35 years since 1980, but one turns up in the first episode, killing at random and, even more improbably, is after Morse  In the original Morse TV series, and the books, both of which I love, murder motives are basically love, money, and ambition. Morse has a sense of humour and often grumpy and dismissive. He's pretty clever at reading people (this may come with time with the young Endeavor, I admit). He enjoys drinking and cigarettes. He has a pint or two at lunch and in the afternoon and moreover, does his best thinking and crime solving while he drinks beer. In convivial setting. I suspect a young Morse would have been pretty cocky, knowing how smart he was compared to his peers. The adult Morse's brain is put to work trying to reconstruct events. The stories revolve around Oxford dons, singers,rich people, middle class people, and ordinary working class people.  .The young Morse is a little tortured, and often quiet, except when there is time for action, in which case he is suddenly loud and decisiv in a way that seeme out of character. I worry that he will develop into the kind of loveable bundle of obsessions portrayed by Tony Shaloub.. In the pilot  and the first show of series one, and part of series two (all I have watched), motives are complex and deeply, cheaply psychological. The trouble is, you can explain anything with psychological motives. For example, person A is sexually repressed so he does nothing. Person B reacts against his sexual repression, so he acts out disproportionately. Morse is told, in the opinion of a ""psychiatrist"":, that people become police because they want to right some wrong. ""What does Morse want to right in his past?"".
IN the original Morse, women and men often have about equal power, although in some cases there are bad marriages where women are oppressed by bullying husbands. People have sex for enjoyment (more often in the books, I admit) . Women (and men) can be lazy, vindictive, and mildly dishonest. While the sixties were a time when women were entering more and more professions and educational institutions, and when women were certainly oppressed, there seems an over emphasis on how women seem to fall into one of the following categories: sweet, innnocent children, 15 year olds who  are manipulated and exploited by nasty men, young women who are knowing and smirk at the naive Endeavour, hard-bitten women, and lovely confident women. If htey are at fault, it is only because they have been mistreated by men. Again, this is is typcial of simplistic meoldrama. In the  original Morse.there are cheap crooks who sometimes work with Morse. Endeavour is far more melodramatic and as in melodrama, no one has any fun or humour unless it is a sneer.. Everything seems strident and over serious. No one has any honest enjoyment although there is a lot of sneering at the oddball young Morse. Like David Copperfield in school.  In the pilot, not one but two powerful separate men exploit a young girl and one is a high level government offiicial,. Fortunately, for no logical reason, one of his flunkies gets him under control for his exploitation. It's a little extreme and unlikely for my tastes. The doctor eyes Morse sternly and says ""Morse. Get this man"". As if Morse would not otherwise try. As if this needs to be said for any reason other than to show the audience that murder is serious. I haven't watched enough episodes to determine whether there are characters who are thieves but not murderers, shady types from whom cops get the word on the street.
The first regular episode is like the Da Vinci code, with a series of bizarre clues, set by an ""evil genius"" "". Frankly, I stopped watching after a half hour because every plot twist seemed so arbitrary. In the Morse books and shows, there is a case to be worked out from the clues. Yes in Morse (and Midsomer Murders) there is an unusually high number of murders for poor old Oxford, but the individual plots are believable.
In Endeavour, plot twists are overexplained, in case the audience doesnt get it first time.. Because he happens to (luckily)  arrange three names in a particular order (by accident) Morse determines that the next victim's name will begin with D. This is explained over and over again. ""Sir! The next target's name will begin with D!"" ""D?"" "" Yes, D!"" and explains why. Orders are given to the constable explaining this. A little girl is captured by the evil genius! Oh goodness. But fortunately she is OK, found in a confined space for at least 12 hours but this doesnt seem to have bothered her. . This is a good thing, of course, but again ridiculously unlikely that she would be captured just because ""he's toying with us , sir"".
Oddly, no one smokes
Finally, two pet peeves. In the pilot, someone is reported born with his umbilicus around his neck. It would actually be the umbilical cord, since the umbilicus is your belly button where the cord was cut. Secondly, Morse faints after the doctor makes a ""lateral cut"" and folds the scalp skin forward. This would have to be a transverse cut - a lateral cut would be on the side of the head.
I prefer the much more realistic Inspector Lewis who is partnered with an intellectual who is more believable than the nearly neurotic Endeavour. See what you think. I was disappointed and I won't watch any more of it, although I am always looking for good English mystery shows.",1493078400,,7552,4.815728604471858

5697333,5,B00C888NFQ,"Wonderful!  Sure, I was a skeptic, John Thaw was irreplaceable.  How could this young unknown (to me) hope to fill Morse's shoes?  After watching the pilot and the first episode of the season I was hooked.  Shaun Evans doesn't attempt to look like Thaw - his mannerisms are only vaguely reminiscent of Thaw's portrayal of Inspector Morse; so then I began thinking he's defining a completely different character.  Not so fast!  Little-by-little, over several episodes,  I detected the mature Morse's established (patented) reactions creep into scenes.  Evans portrays a detective ""growing into the role"" of Morse; just as Endeavour Morse grew into a first rate detective with the Oxford PD, so, too, does Shaun Evans.  It is an impressive display of an actor's skill to pull off such a feat.  And kudos to the director and the writers for allowing him to do so.  Or, did they suggest it?  Who knows?  I don't care who thought of it, it works!",1485216000,,941,4.80625

5697337,5,B00C888NFQ,"If you love British suspense thrillers or murder mysteries you will almost certainly love the new Endeavor series. This is the prequel to the Inspector Morse Series. Lead actor, Shaun Evans,  gives a rich performance as a nave yet gifted police investigator. The supporting cast is nothing less than extraordinary.  In short,  if you like British TV watch this series.
 Specifically;  Roger Allam, James Bradshaw, Anton Lesser, Sean Rigby, Caroline O'Neill, Jack Lasky, Abigail Thaw, and Sara Vickers also give rich, brilliant performances. James Bradshaw is probably the very best cast as a young version of the future Inspector Morse character as Dr. DeBryn.  There's not enough space to praise the fullness of each of the above actors performances respectively. These are real people,  set an a real world, that I've only read about. One in all in this cast, directing, writing, and production bring this era upfront and personal. Again, if you like British TV watch Endeavor!",1485129600,,979,5.158227848101266

5697501,4,B00C888NFQ,"I watched these streaming via the web application, though I saw them for the first time on PBS television. I had no technical troubles watching them streaming and I really liked the x-ray function of the web app that would show you a list of actors that were on the screen if you moused over it.

The Endeavor series is the prequel to the Inspector Morse series and is made with that in mind. Much of what happens is to show how the psyche of Inspector Morse, as seen in the famous series that bears his name, is molded early in his career.  Many claim it is too slow. It'd say the pacing is similar to the Inspector Morse series, but slower than Inspector Lewis (which is something of a sequel).  In my opinion, since it is a prequel made after the Inspector series, I would watch that one first to gain more appreciation for what this is about. Endeavor can be viewed alone, but be prepared for long sequences of over literary cynicism and intellectual elitism that I assume are the stereotype of Oxford mixed in with the class politics that one usually finds in British shows (the Police Superintendent, Bright, is the main representative of class politics in this one).

As mentioned, a lot of the show is to establish the starting point of the Inspector Morse series (which is when he much older), especially episode 4 of season 1.

I enjoyed it, but I can see how some were not impressed. It's best approached after watching and enjoying the Inspector Morse series. If these are too slow, I'd advise skipping to Inspector Lewis' series. It's faster paced and in the same story sequence.",1480723200,,1592,4.5524475524475525

All aspects of this series deserves five stars, from the screen writing to the concept to the acting and directing. An excellent series that can be watched without knowing the elder Morse or enjoyed more fully by knowing the elder Morse and seeing him grow up. Morse the younger is extremely well played. His facial expressions are priceless. The things he says and does are spot on and it is so easy to believe this is the same actor that in later years plays the elder Morse. But, of course, since the elder Morse comes first, this is quite impossible!

But I HATE Amazon Prime.  Prices are $21 for DVD and Multi-Format is $26.99.  I thought that meant that I got the DVD and streaming for one price.
NOW I find out that Multi-Format means Blu-Ray!!  and then I must pay $2.99 MORE to stream!

I have NEVER seen Multi-Format mean Blu-Ray. Yes I undesstand that this disc can be played on a non Blu-Ray player AND a Blu-Ray.  Just never saw it advertised this way.

The fact that this is the prequel to the beloved Inspector Morse series and we get to see Inspector Morse as a young Detective Constable under his mentor, Inspector Friday and working alongside Superintendent Strange when he was just a young Constable in uniform is just priceless and makes this all the more delicious. For me, this is one of those shows that you hope will never end and which they can't produce fast enough. Definitely worth a try if you like intelligent, multi-layered TV, highly recommended if you like British mysteries, and an absolute must if you are an Inspector Morse fan.

Endeavour like Inspector Morse is the rare case of when the video is just as good if not better than the book.

Endeavor is amazingly complex and so un-cop-like.  It is wonderful to see someone in law enforcement who struggles with the vagaries his job entails and who sometimes feels just a little guilty about having to do the job he is expected to do.  I want to see all of the episodes, just cannot afford to buy the sets.",1474588800,,459,4.62962962962963

As long as you don't mind believing that Oxford England is a city with its streets awash in blood from at least two murders per show, it's great TV.  Wonderful characters, including the villains, and plenty of opportunity to review the clues and make your own conclusions. (I am usually wrong.  Hitchcock would have loved this show.)  I wish it would go on for several more seasons.",1473984000,,436,4.773333333333333

The dialogue is very well-done, like hearing the characters as actual people living and chatting, not just about what is happening in the story-line, but side comments as well.
The development of each character is as absorbing as getting acquainted with new friends and others in our daily lives.
Last, but certainly not least, is the music. It is beautiful, enhancing the story tremendously, and it is well-done by the musicians who perform it.
I have found each episode thus far to be completely  satisfactory.

5697729,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well written, creative and non-formulaic, good storytelling.  On most shows I usually figure out who did it by halfway through, but with these I often can't even come up with any good guesses, and it's never been who I think it is or why.  Deeply engaging, and the plot isn't spoon fed to the viewer, so you enjoy becoming immersed in the story and characters. The first episode in the first season gets off to a little of an uneven start, just like many new shows as the actors and characters are together for the first time.

5697733,5,B00C888NFQ,The series is a backstory to DI Morse and thus provides the character traits seen in the older detective while completing the initiation into the field of police work. The well-developed characterization of individuals is artfully braided together with music and mood. I appreciate the Sherlock intelligence with the human over-thinking of details at times. This humanized Sherlock has difficulty with the mundane and sometimes overthinks details as he studies under a seasoned inspector who appreciates his ability as he mentors him.,1473465600,,534,5.524390243902439

5697764,5,B00C888NFQ,Have really enjoyed Endeavor. Every episode has a very interesting mystery with main characters the viewer comes to care about.,1473033600,,127,5.4
5697765,5,B00C888NFQ,"Excellent production. Stong stories and characters, set in an authentic, beautifully photographed 1960's Oxford, England.
The bar was set high with the very original Morse series, starring the brilliant John Thaw.
 Shaun Evans, in the lead role of Endevour, the younger Morse, does not disappointment. Of course there is the temptation to make comparisons with the original, but really there is no need. Endevour holds its own and does not rely on the original for support. However, if you are a fan of Morse, then you will enjoy the unravelling of the older character from the events depicted in Endevour. You may even revisit the original series with a clearer understanding and renewed sympathy for the iconic detective.
The high production value keeps the episode number down to just four per season.  However, the shows are movie quality, and no doubt a great deal of work to produce.
The result is a masterpiece.",1473033600,,918,4.993464052287582

5697895,4,B00C888NFQ,"Nicely acted; faithful evocation of 60s Britain; case resolution sometimes a bit abrupt (and there's plenty of time to avoid this), perhaps even a bit silly, but w whole remains thoroughly enjoyable.",1470700800,,199,5.25
5697896,5,B00C888NFQ,Let's hope that there are many more series planned for this gem.  We watched all the seasons tnat have been recorded thus far and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The music is stunning throughout the series.,1470700800,,198,4.794117647058823

5697918,5,B00C888NFQ,Great British detective series.  Wonderful character development and so much better than what is on American television.  This is a spin off from the detective Morris series and is great entertainment.,1470700800,,201,5.451612903225806
5697919,5,B00C888NFQ,"Especially if you know and have enjoyed the original Morse series, this is a great way to learn how that older, cranky, opera-loving, probably alcoholic (I give him the benefit of the doubt) chief inspector got that way. I really loved the young man who played the lead, still new and open and sort of clumsy, but whip smart, which irritates his superiors, for whom the chain of command is everything, even if it means being wrong and never showing that you know you were wrong. Because that's what being English is all about. Very well done series.",1470700800,,549,4.612244897959184

5697934,5,B00C888NFQ,In you like the Inspector Morse series then you should love this one as well.  Endeavor is Morse's first name and this series is the story of his beginning days with Scotland Yard.  Good scripts and calmer than the Morse series.

First, I find it thoroughly intriguing to view mid-1960's life.  Although Oxford is different than upstate New York where I grew up, the series brings back a flood of memories starting with the prevalence of smoking.  I enjoy the scripts on this show which show more tension about how to maneuver through conflicting goals.

But it is Shaun Evans who holds it all together. Evans is a gem of an actor who brings his original and authentic perspective on the life of the young detective Morse. He brings a thoughtful and nuanced portrayal showing the struggles and adventures in the life of a smart, young detective trying to find his place in the world. With an impressive supporting cast, beautiful scenery and the signature lush music by Barrington Pheloung, Endeavour will have you hooked from the beginning. Oxford has never looked so smart or engaging.",1469923200,,687,5.035087719298246

5698053,5,B00C888NFQ,"The ABC's of Endeavour are, on one end, young Morse's idealism and his mind, with, in the middle, Thursday's ability to allow that idealism while also allowing Morse to run with his brilliance (because Thursday is a Renaissance man at heart). On the other end, the entitled pretentiousness and priggishness of Bright provides teeth-grinding tension. What the ABC's don't tell you is that this series is exquisitely filmed, written, and acted. The music, whether from the original score or from the operas Morse so loves, is beautiful, and in some episodes actually defines the crime(s), especially in Fugue, the second episode. Probably sacrilege, but I've never watched the original Inspector Morse, and given how deep the production values and stories are in Endeavour, I might not ever watch them, for fear of being let down. While Shaun Evans is superb as Morse, the man to watch, imho, is Roger Allam as Thursday. He perfectly shows us the subtle mockery and disdain he feels toward Bright, he's as smart as Morse, he's the consummate gentleman, and not to put too fine a point on it, he's a serious badass. I have to give accolades also to Sean Rigby, who plays Jim Strange, a police constable who becomes Morse's unlikely friend, and is superb in his dedication to Morse. All in all, a wonderful series, I think anyone who appreciates the amazing talent coming out of the U.K. these days will thoroughly enjoy it. It's an excellent entry in Masterpiece's stable of superlatives.",1469750400,2,1485,4.920318725099602

5698109,3,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour Morse is less visually and musically attractive than the Inspector Morse series. The prissy Chief Inspector who dislikes Endeavour is too sharply antagonistic to our hero. Plot resolution is no more convoluted or likely  than in the Morse series, a weakness in most cops and robbers stories. That may be in the nature of television -- it can not provide the details in books that make Sam Spade's adventures and plots more coherent if not much more like real life. The fantasy is what makes Spade interesting, ditto for Endeavour and Morse.",1469404800,,550,4.913978494623656

However putting him as an up and comer where he has to prove himself to his superiors and the community keeps down the arrogance (or superior attitude) the older Morse had.

It is a fabulous show, and the actor who plays a younger Morse, Shaun Evans, is truly amazing and believable in that role.

In addition, Chief Inspector Bright is the perfect adversarial character for DI Morse. He provides a good amount of conflict, and makes me feel personally tormented when I watch scenes with him. Overall, one thing I like best about this show is that there is a satisfying ending to each of the episodes. After all of the chaos and the clues that are presented throughout each episode, at the end, everything gets tidied up, and you can sit back and know that justice has been served.",1468454400,,655,4.655172413793103

A younger version shows the dedication to the job but also the determination and special abilities to see things others don't.  His mentor is obviously a big part of making him into the man he became.  Fortunately, we get a pick into the personality quirks as well.

The cases are interesting and I have loved figuring out who done it. Morse is the criminal minds before criminal minds. Before widespread computers, Dna, swat teams, ballistics and all those sorts of things that litter crime shows these days. What we have is old fashioned detective work and the brilliant mind of a junior officer hoping to become a Sargent with the gift of being able to link millions of pieces together to solve crimes.

5698487,5,B00C888NFQ,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the music! If a viewer doesn't like classical music, it could be a problem. Morse is a very sensitive character who pairs extremely sharp observation skills with quiet and sort of humble behavior. His direct boss understands and values him and acts as a buffer between Morse and a Superintendent who seems extremely insensitive to Morse's gifts. There are some underlying secrets (which may have been disclosed in the pilot, that I haven't seen): Morse's reasons for his choice of career, the depth of his relationship to his immediate boss.... The plots for the episodes are suspenseful and very informative without being bloody and unnecessarily explicit. This has become one of my favorites and since I just discovered it, I'm looking forward to some good TV.",1467072000,2,781,5.015384615384615

He studied at Oxford-- we knew that!-- and he has this way of reasoning, or noticing odd pieces of evidence, sets of facts, circumstances, and seeing patterns. He runs up against the system and the higher-ups, and feels the heavy disapproval of others. He perseveres. He lands in trouble, and pays the price.

reason enough, the visuals. So many scenes both exterior and interior, just so beautiful, and lingered over by the camera. One could watch just for this.

5698623,5,B00C888NFQ,"I really enjoyed seeing Inspector Morse as a young man.  I especially enjoyed the scene when Young Morse looked in his rear view mirror to see old Morse.  The story, of course set the tone for the series.  I thought that it was very well done.  The dissappointment over his worship of the soprano was difficult to watch, but it was another coming-of-age experience.
Something confused me... Was this first episode the only show in season 1?  I could not find the rest of the season.  Are there only 4 shows in season 2?  I am watching season 3 now on PBS  I enjoy what I have seen and hope to fill in the missing pieces.",1466380800,,620,4.2844827586206895

5698629,4,B00C888NFQ,"I admit, I am a big fan of Inspector Morse played by the late John Thaw, and Inspector Lewis played by Kevin Whately,  The stories and the actors who play the major characters were wonderful. Therefore, I had high hopes that a show based on Morse when he was much younger and learning the ropes would join my favorite list.

The show is not bad and Shawn Evans, who plays Morse, is good, and I think Roger Allam, the actor who plays Morse boss, is very good, but the show itself has not hit the level where Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis had achieved.

Perhaps, it is my age or other factors, or perhaps like scotch whiskey it will get better with age..

Shaun Evans gives a good performance of what a younger Morse might have been like. You can care for this younger Morse just like you did for John Thaw's Morse. And younger Morse having mentor like Detective Fred Thursday really makes his growth in series seem genuine. All characters in Carshall-Newtown Police station are really good too.

5698762,5,B00C888NFQ,"Being a long-time fan of Inspector Morse, Endeavour is an outstanding series that gives us insight into the Morse character as he grew to be the unusual detective inspector he became, as played by John Thaw.  Roger Allem shines as DI Thursday--the mentor to the young Morse, and Shaun Evans plays the fledgling detective Morse vulnerably and convincingly.  My favorite series on Amazon Prime and Fire TV.",1464480000,,404,5.014925373134329

5698767,5,B00C888NFQ,"Whoever came up with the idea of going back in fictional time to show us what the fabled Inspector Morse was like as a young policeman is a GENIUS! I ADORE THIS PILOT! It was love at first sight for Shaun Evans and Roger Allam! I watched the show several times on American TV and just had to have it on DVD but didn't realize the UK Edition contains about 20 minutes MORE than what was aired on this side of the Atlantic - what a treat!!! What writing! What casting! What a great mystery, filmed in HD! Bravo, Endeavour! And Inspector Thursday, of course, and all the cast including beloved dearly departed John Thaw's delightful daughter in a memorable cameo - brilliant in every detail, brought back my college days which were fraught with unexpected terrors, and showed me far too late in life that professors as well as community leaders of various stripes are as capable of vile behavior as any of the worst riffraff in among the general public - how they can and do break idealistic, trusting young hearts. The film glows with period touches - interiors, autos, old-time car showrooms, clothing, LPs, portable radios and record players, saggy old rooming houses just off campus, sarcastic supervisors, bumpy bus rides, schoolgirl crushes, bouffant hairdos, Capri pants, tricky crosswords, Old School college classrooms complete with plaster casts of classical sculpture - it's all here, to the strains of Madame Butterfly. Not to be missed.",1464393600,,1446,4.8582995951417
5698768,5,B00C888NFQ,Those folks at Masterpiece Mystery just can't lose. Where do they get so many talented and magnetic character actors? Even the minor characters are fascinating to watch. The visuals of Oxford University are stunning. I go on line and read the plot synopsis before I watch each episode. Otherwise I get lost in the fast pace and numerous plot twists. As a classical musician I appreciate all the opera and choral references. I am so delighted I discovered this series (May 2016). I have three seasons to catch up on as summer viewing and the new season comes out on PBS on June 16!,1464393600,,580,4.586538461538462

5698773,5,B00C888NFQ,"so far I really enjoy watching this series.  I hope the series has a long run so we can slowly discover what made Morse the person he was.
When we first meet Morse he does not drink, very soon he is beginning to drink like a fish.  I found the comment his sister made to him when
he took her to a pub ""I thought you had taken the pledge"" to be very puzzling.  Had he been an alcoholic?",1464307200,,385,3.848101265822785

5698775,4,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavor is faithful in the Masterpiece tradition of great writing, fine acting and beautiful settings.

in life.  The connection, and respect, he holds for Inspector Fred Thursday explains why he continues to think highly of him later on.  The complex
plots, and quiet clues to the culprits, makes this new series so fantastic.  Difficult to pick out the culprit.",1463702400,,396,4.850746268656716

Beautifully rendered sets create a palpable ambiance of a past era while painting the story characters in a stark and critical light that lends a sense of realism to the episodes. The  weekly crime plots are sufficiently obtuse to keep you wondering until the reveal, while the over-arching immersion into Morse's personality is circuitous and reflective allowing you to understand the nature of his fatal flaws while still appreciating the genius of his logic.

5698860,4,B00C888NFQ,"As the prequel to Inspector Morse, Endeavour feels authentic and a touch more gritty than the previous series. The character is younger and inexperienced, but driven by an insatiable desire to ferret out connections that aid in solving grand puzzles. This dichotomy allows for a much more raw experience than the its predecessor series. It is the perfect compliment to Inspector Morse, as it balances the elegant, dexterous sleuthing ability with the foibles and awkwardness of youthful inexperience. I highly recommend it.",1462838400,,523,5.390243902439025

5698900,3,B00C888NFQ,"Ive never watched the original Inspector Morse series so I came at this as a complete neophyte.
Each episode begins in the same fashion, presenting the viewer with a hodgepodge of seemingly unrelated snippets signifying nothing in particular, people doing this or that, a glimpse, nothing more.  Then the story unfolds and eventually you're led to the reasons behind these brief glances askance.  I found that gimmick annoying.  As for the characters, most are thoroughly unlikable, bad cops abound, getting away with corruption, subterfuge, and cover-ups.  Its a bleak portrayal of the 60s in Oxford.  Cynicism seems to be everyones forte.  And into this mess struggles young Morse (Shaun Evans).  Hes perfunctory, cold, abrupt, and too smart for his own good.  This trait sets everyone on edge.  Of the batch, the only characters I liked were Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) and Jim Strange (Sean Rigby).  The mysteries are interesting.  The show is well made.  But I cant say I particularly enjoyed watching this first series.",1462233600,,1025,5.1454545454545455
5698901,5,B00C888NFQ,I loved Inspector Morse and when it ended I was crushed... this new pre-life of Inspector Morse is just fabulous! Love everything about it and love how it really does answer questions and show details about Inspector Morse. Great Series,1462233600,,236,4.925

5698905,5,B00C888NFQ,"I've actually always loved Inspector Morse, and watched Endeavour twice, enjoyed it all the more.

His partner Thursday and he make a wonderful team.",1462147200,,264,5.261904761904762
5698906,5,B00C888NFQ,The development of the characters and the plot in these episodes makes this series one of my favorites. It doesn't feel rushed or repetitive. The audience gets the ability to both appreciate the main lead's interest in classical music as well as his sharp analytical mind. Loved it.,1462147200,,282,4.895833333333333
5698907,4,B00C888NFQ,The closing scene of episode one is one of the absolute best ever! Loved Morse and now love Endeavour. My only complaint is that the resolution of the crime seems rushed at the end of each episode.,1462147200,,197,4.351351351351352

5698911,5,B00C888NFQ,"Thought provoking plots.  Endeavor is a young Morse with many of the same endearing traits of the older man he became.  We hear opera and other music from the classical composers.  In some cases one can almost see the thoughts arranging themselves into a pattern which no one else seems to see.  Very good, very typical British production.",1461974400,,339,4.793103448275862

5698937,5,B00C888NFQ,The absolute best TV series ever. The writing and acting are pentrating and so real you believe that Morse is an actual person. The musical score is the finest of any recent offerings set next to the pablem of syntetic music that passes for most TV fare. I purchased the series and will purchase Season 3 when it comes out. Watch the first season and you will be hooked.,1461715200,,370,4.3768115942028984

5699046,4,B00C888NFQ,"I have to say, I really do like this series.  Only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had a bit of trouble getting in to the first episode.  Part of the reason is that I have a bit of trouble understanding their accent.  I watch British shows all of the time and have little or no trouble understanding with the accent, but this one is just a bit more difficult for me throughout the season.

5699124,5,B00C888NFQ,"Fresh and inventive take on the early career of Inspector Morse. Shaun Evans perfectly encapsulates the persona and characteristics of Morse, while lending a youthful innocence and naivet all his own. The result is an enjoyable interplay of a mid-century Oxford social drama with the strong characters and understated mysteries that constituted the later Inspector Morse (and subsequently Inspector Lewis-) series that we have come to appreciate. Five Stars.",1456617600,,458,5.6521739130434785
5699125,5,B00C888NFQ,"These stories about a younger Morse just starting out in detecting are really enjoyable. There is the young Morse, his mentor Detective Inspector Thursday and several of the other characters we know from the Morse series. Well filmed the acting is great. The young Morse may blunder and seem far out as a detective but his evolution is fascinating. This series may well be better than the Morse series itself! It certainly is fun to watch. I started out with Morse and then went through the Lewis series before starting Endeavor. They are all great fun to watch but for some reason I am enjoying Endeavor more than the rest. Set in the sixties the young Morse develops right before your eyes in the stories. Well worth watching!",1456617600,,728,4.6953125

The story lines keep you guessing, but the cars are the best part for me... Ford Cortina, Zephyr 4 and 6, Corsair; Ford Anglia (yes, we spotted that they used the same clip of that drive-by the department store three times in one episode, but that's ok!); Austin 1100; Austin Cambridge or Westminster (or Morris Oxford?); Commer vans; Jags; Wolseley or Riley; double-decker buses with 'jump on' back platforms ...I think I even spotted an Alvis 3-Litre but could be wrong.  I was a kid in the 60s and early 70s with no Internet, but a well-worn edition of the Observer's Book of Automobiles to teach me about almost every car on the road in England ... most of them were made in England then!  I dreamed of owning a car, eventually buying a 1960 Ford Popular 1172cc side-valve for fifty quid! Sold it for fifty quid 3 or4 years later. This show is not only nostalgic, it is an accurate record of life back then and for me, a dream come true!  Brilliant!!",1454544000,2,1160,4.462264150943396

5699699,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series is so much better than ""Morse.""  The younger Morse is sharp, witty, personable,and is alert for every little clue. The older Morse
character is disheveled, most often inebriated, grumpy, often wrong, sarcastic, and downright unlike able. ""Endeavour's"" younger version of
Morse makes one wonder why he grew into such a louse. Both shows are nearly 2hours long, but I find myself immersed in Endeavour's
scripts and actors while the Morse shows are tedious and oh so slow watching a bumbler luck out on solving some crime that should have and could have been done in a 30 minute show, including some welcome commercials. I heartily recommend Endeavour !",1447632000,,663,5.027272727272727

5699718,5,B00C888NFQ,"A very interesting way to find out what made Morse become what he was. He started out kind and caring. A softer nature but with his remarkable crime fighting mind and sense of justice highly advanced. It shows his backstory of why other police hate him. Morse expected the police to be honest and trustworthy. To be working for the betterment of the communities. This was not always true in the '50s and '60s. And with the young actor playing Morse, you can slowly see the changes and the choices that made him the final product: Inspector Morse. Season 2 stopped with a clifhanger and I can't wait to see how he gets out of it.",1447372800,,628,4.422413793103448

It also shows the influence of his boss and mentor as well as the development of his understanding for the need of basic police work as opposed to esoteric theories, despite how he operates later in life.

5700004,5,B00C888NFQ,Endeavor is a prequel to the very popular Inspector Morse series. This precedes in time the Inspector Lewis series. I very much like the character of Morse in this series and rushed through both series 1 and 2. These mysteries are totally unlike those created in the US. They have deep characters that your relate to so the opportunity to meet Morse when he first began was lovely. I didn't like his character much in the Inspector Morse series although I loved Lewis later to be lead detective in Inspector Lewis. I also have yet to guess the villain in any of these mysteries because the plot turns and twists like a village lane in England.,1443139200,,643,4.551724137931035

For Morse and Inspector Lewis fans in particular, the writing provides terrific insight into the characters -- with fabulous acting that so well depicts the many characters we saw at much older ages in the earlier series --Chief Superintendent Strange and Max.

t is very atmospheric--set in late 1950s-60s and I found all of the scenery and props of great interest.  The score is wonderfully rich and music is incorporated in the life of the characters.  Acting is a very high standard, even for the British, which brings the dialogue to credible life.  The best aspect for me is the wealth of literary references throughout that emphasize the intelligence and education of the young Morse.  He and his mentor Thursday play the knights errant, their high ethical standards (practiced, not preached) challenged not just from the outside but also the inside of their  police agency.

  Fault may be found with the way that the plot mysteries are summed up and solved in what seems like a few seconds at the end of each episode.  But I am not really there for the puzzle solving.",1435968000,,993,4.548022598870056

5700569,5,B00C888NFQ,Love the original Inspector Morse series starring John Thaw and it is interesting how some of the characters in the Endeavor series appear their youthful selves whereas in the original Morse series you see them as mature adults at the top of their professions.,1434412800,,260,4.931818181818182

5700619,3,B00C888NFQ,"I am not sure why I cannot seem to get on with this one when I usually love the BCC shows.

5700642,5,B00C888NFQ,"This Masterpiece series, is the prequal  to the long running series ""Morse.""  We have watched that whole series, but you don't have to watch it first to appreciate Endeavour. This is British police drama at it's best.  Set in the 1960's with all the attending social upheaval that went with that era.  Morse is played as a quiet, music loving detective, who has lots of problems with his superior's, except for his immediate boss, Inspector Thursday.  Thursday recognizes the special skill, that Morse has in police work, and tries to give guidance.  The scripts are well written.  There is humor, and warmth in the story lines and it is just a very well produced series, as almost all Masterpiece series, are.  We have really enjoyed watching it, and hope they make another season or two.  So far there are only two seasons on Amazon, and only four episodes in each.  It is a very good  series.",1433721600,,895,4.673076923076923

5700651,4,B00C888NFQ,"Of all the ""Morse"" series (Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis, and this one, Endeavour), this one is easily the best. You don't need to have watched the others, but watching them, especially the Morse series, will enhance and enrich the enjoyment of this one. By far the best of all three. This takes place when Morse was a young man, a prequel if you will, in the 1960's. They do a very good job of keeping that 60's feel in the series. In this series the murder investigations are more complex and Morse turns heads with his educated background... much fun!",1433721600,,557,4.58
5700652,5,B00C888NFQ,Thoughtful mysteries and great character studies.  I like what the British do with murder mysteries. The stories are interesting and the characters are multidimensional.

Shaun Evans and Roger Allam are particular standouts, who's character's fierce innate intelligence interact with both a tension and ease that crackles on the screen.  One of the best series I've seen in years. Don't bother to over-think others reviews or choose to compare it to anything else.  Just watch and enjoy!

The show is top notch and I'm something of a movie maven, preferring indie and foreign films to the vampire/ancient-warrior/action movies of the now Hollywood. I'm not an opera fan by a long chalk, but that's a minor thing for all the good acting and the interesting story lines (though there are flaws here and there), as well as the development of the nick's various personalities and those relationships.

5700802,4,B00C888NFQ,"Not sure everyone would, but I find this series satisfying and relaxing, mainly because of the sensitive, expressive face of the lead actor, Shaun Evans, who, in this prequel to *Inspector Morse,* plays Morse as a young, apprenctice police officer. The series'  plots circle around, but do not really concern the tangle of apparent coincidences that, in each segment, improbably turn out to be connected by often unrevealed details that do not pretend to engage the assistance of the audience in solving anything. Nothing is shown, all is told, spelled out, really, at the end of each episode. The real continuing plot concerns the development of young Morse, especially in connection with his mentor, the impeccably named D.I. Fred Thursday. It's sweet and unworrying, but poses little of the challenge sought by mystery, crime, or puzzle buffs.",1431302400,2,846,5.175182481751825

5700836,5,B00C888NFQ,"As with all such ratings/reviews mine is highly subjective so I'll start by saying that I suspect that die-hard Inspector Morse fans will be disappointed.  I've been watching Endeavor and Morse more-or-less side-by-side and they seem to me to be quite different characters.  Endeavor is for the most part observant and logical, using intuition only when he seems to have reached a dead end.  Morse on the other hand seems to be all wild leaps of intuition which he will only abandon when forced to by the facts (or Lewis).  Speaking of which, Endeavor reminds me much more of Hathaway from Inspector Lewis than the older Inspector Morse.

So, why five stars?  If one can let the series stand on it's own then it's an absolute gem!  Watching Endeavor wrestle with all the social and political problems caused by forcing his virtually Sherlockian intellect and powers of observation to work within a system populated almost exclusively by Watsons and Lestrades is a real treat.  In addition, the bonds, both professional and emotional, between Endeavor and Thursday add greater depth and continuity as the series progresses.  Of course, the mysteries/cases Endeavor gets involved with are a treat too so, all-in-all, this is an excellent show.  In fact, it's so good I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon eventually removes it's ""Prime"" status.",1430438400,,1338,5.040909090909091

5700868,5,B00C888NFQ,"It is a bit strange to see John Thaw reincarnated by Shaun Evans...spooky, almost.  But this newest Morse spinoff fully matches its older siblings--Morse and Lewis--in the quality of its writing, acting, music and production values.  Roger Allam is wonderful as Thursday and Evans does Thaw proud in his portrayal of the nascent Morse...complex, brooding, intense and still somehow vulnerable. Morse wasn't a beginner even when he began--what he lacked in sophistication he made up for in understanding human nature--that is, every human's nature other than his own.  I find this series darker than either Morse or Lewis--visually and in its plot lines.  Perhaps that is because it lacks a young Lewis or Hathaway to provide quick, acerbic one-liners that lighten the mood.  Endeavour's fellow coppers--with the exception of Strange--are a pretty dour lot.  Oxford--a star in both of the previous series--is still a presence, but not such a centerpiece here.  A physical darkness about the cinematography is somewhat foreboding and it dims the glory of that beautiful, ancient university town..  It is interesting to see how the writers, directors and producers manage to weave common threads from the original through the two still being produced...or maybe it is just that we know and love the characters so, and that provides the continuity.  Whatever the reason, Endeavour is a worthy addition to the ongoing saga of these determined and interesting detective series.",1430265600,,1471,5.306034482758621

5700891,5,B00C888NFQ,"Absolutely Brilliant.  Morse is a 60's version of a computer geek without the computer or technology.  His detective skills and his excellent observation skills as well as his unending desire to serve justice to the victim's families makes him a formidable champion for those who have been wronged.  Fred Thursday's character is the perfect Mentor/Boss for Morse as he believes in him and his sometimes outlandish obsession with connecting seemingly unconnected events, but also deeply cares for Morse as a person and almost as a son without doting on him at all.  Each mystery they solve in so intricately weaved through so many different players and possibilities that you rarely see or anticipate the actual person ""who done it"".",1429747200,,732,5.126050420168068

5701054,4,B00C888NFQ,"Good stories. Well acted. A bit over the top with the conspiracies but it doesn't detract from the story too much. You don't see a lot of TV set in the 60's, so that part is nice -- different. The stories are built with a lot of misdirection and they have the time to really develop characters and relationships. The pacing is slower than an hour long mystery, but that's mostly a good thing. This is similar to Broadchurch, although not as dark, mixed with a bit of Sherlock Holmes (most good murder mystery shows have a large does of Holmes in them).",1427155200,,552,4.368932038834951

5701103,5,B00C888NFQ,"So far this series has been remarkably refreshing.  Like most BBC shows today, the production quality is on par with the top tier American shows.  Unlike most of its American counterparts, it's writing continues to serve as a shining example of what it means to write to an audience as a group of peers instead of a group of children who have yet to achieve even a high school level understanding of the world.  The writers also manage to weave in enough intrigue about the pasts of the recurring characters to create a mystery inside of a mystery.  A lot of series attempt to do this in America, but currently, apart from Hannibal and possibly The Black List, I haven't seen many that are as capable of sustaining the kind of tension seen in Endeavour.  On a side note,  it's remarkable that so many British mysteries are able to create suspense without resorting to the kind of ""moneyshot"" violence that punctuates most of American television.  I'm not saying I dislike its use, but it is a nice change of pace when I'm looking for a relaxing but thought provoking form of entertainment devoid of the cathartic, visceral release I seek out so often in our more gun friendly society.",1426636800,,1184,4.636363636363637

I thoroughly enjoy the main character. He is so sincere and does try for the truth each time he's involved in solving a crime. The added nuance to this man's character is that he cares for the underdog and doesn't rest 'til he's helped that person. Very little ego with this character. Driven by the right thing to do and never loses sight of that because this is what gives him the ultimate pleasure in his work and direction of his life.",1426636800,,584,4.416666666666667

Endeavour completely explains how and why the limp is there.  There are other small points the make watching Inspector Morse even more enjoyable than before.

I not only recommend watching Endeavour but also recommend watching Inspector Morse so as to see the complete person from beginning to the end of his career.

Now, in the best tradition of both TV and movies, we have the prequel.  Endeavor, played by Shaun Evans, has taken up the mantle and begun to show us how Morse came to be the Morse we know and remember.  Mentored by DI Thursday, whose role has been written to give hints and the shadows that cast events before them, we can once again look at the Thames River Police.

For one thing, the casting for Endeavour is spot on. Shaun Evans young Morse is perfect, but I also liked seeing the young Strange (who later becomes Morse's station boss). The man who plays Morse's very elderly father looks like he could be actor John Thaw's brother. I particularly like the fact that they've cast John Thaw's real-life daughter Abigail Thaw as the editor of the local newspaper. In the first episode where she appears there's a delightful in-joke that plays on the curious assignments of the actors in this series and the earlier one.

The stores, too, are first rate at least in this first season. The first season makes quite a bit of Morse's love of opera. As a classically trained musician myself, I have to add that I'm very fond of Barrington Pheloung's music for the series, especially the theme song, which is a beautiful, beautiful melody. (My other favorite of all the themes is the early theme for the Adam Dalgliesh mysteries starring Roy Marsden.)

I'm a fan of the Colin Dexter books and of the later Morse series. Morse is one of those grown ups it's hard to imagine ever having been young. I am delighted that the makers of Endeavour, series 1, did such a good job.",1425254400,2,1440,4.63921568627451

The lead actor in this show is great.  I love it and watch it everyday while waiting on the new season.  If you only watch it once I know you will miss at least one clue.

5701242,5,B00C888NFQ,"I actually like Endeavor much better than Inspector Morse, in part because this is charicter development, which I prefer, and in part because I like the time period it is set in. Yes the period fits in with the canonical time line of the series, but what makes this time period really interesting is the cold war mentality in a ubn town during the late 1960's. The fun of the series, and the annoyance, comes from playing off the setting, specificlly the 'gown' side of Oxford, the murderers are brilliant, and it takes Endeavor's brilliance to catch them. Just once I would like for a basic robbery gone wrong, clues as either red herrings, or reading into the case, I want him to be wrong. I want the writers and to show him working hard at basic police work (which by the way is an echo of an internal criticism of Endeavor by another character).

I'm a classical music fan, so I certainly appreciate the richness of the score, even a plot that hinges on knowledge of several operatic plots.  I like the series, but I'm disappointed by it at the same time.  The casting is phenomenal -- special kudos here to Shaun Evans as the mysterious Endeavour Morse, and Roger Allam as the hard-boiled D.I. Thursday who proves to have brains, guts, and heart under that hard shell exterior.  The production values are terrific, gorgeously and cleverly produced.  It's the plotting that bothers me.  The final twists and turns in each episode are melodramatic, nonsensical, leave wide open gaping holes at every turn, and ultimately rob you of the satisfaction of perfect plotting like a good faithful adaptation of Conan Doyle or John le Carr.  So, like Sherlock, eminently watchable, terrific casting with chemistry that makes it worth watching for 80 minutes, but frustrating on a logical level in those last 10 minutes.",1424390400,,1073,5.028248587570621

5701403,3,B00C888NFQ,"This series is based on the character created by Colin Dexter, Inspector Morse.  The episodes cover the start of Morse's career as an Oxford police investigator. I enjoy the mystery series from England shown on PBS. Under other conditions, I would be inclined to give this type of programing five stars. Unfortunately, I find the Morse character portrayed by Shaun Evans totally unrelated to the character created by John Thaw.  I find Shaun Evans' diction garbled and difficult to follow. His acting often misses the mark, underacting in places and creating unnecessary, distracting atmosphere in others. The murder plots are interesting and suitably complex but Mr. Evans' acting detracts materially.",1420156800,,702,5.372727272727273

5701436,5,B00C888NFQ,"This is a totally engaging and brilliant prequel to the equally engaging and brilliant Inspector Morse series.

The middle-aged Morse was portrayed by the great John Thaw and it seems unlikely that any actor could approach the level he attained throughout eight seasons in that role. But Shaun Evans is the perfect man to bring to life the young Morse, a prickly detective who is charming in a subtle, curmudgeonly way, and apprehends the motives of other men yet is destined to never fit in.
to be irretrievably alone.
Add the Oxford backgrounds, the exceptional cast (which includes the late John Thaw's daughter Abigail) and the incredibly clever plots and you have entertainment of the highest order.",1419897600,,704,5.017094017094017

5701444,5,B00C888NFQ,"This cleverly written series uses brilliant scripting, beautiful photography, and unusual plot twists to keep the viewer intrigued. The hero is a highly-educated detective out of his element on a working-class police force who uses his education and interests to tie together apparently unrelated cases and clues. Instead of a macho Magnum PI, we have a nerdy, well-read opera fan who uses brain rather than brawn to get the job done. Each episode drops a clue or two that there is more to his story than meets the eye, and I'm sure future series will give us more to hold our curiosity.
If you liked ""Foyle's War"", you will probably like this series set in an England about 20 years thereafter. The cinematography makes ""Endeavour"" look more like a film than a TV series.",1419638400,,772,4.768656716417911

5701472,5,B00C888NFQ,"Inspector Morse is young and naive both in terms of office politics, and females, who although throwing themselves at him, confuse him.

Here in the first two episodes my wife and I have found a plot line, dialogue, and character development which isn't afraid of being complex and smart. Most of the stories are not of the loud bang and colorful explosion-type, but instead, grapple you with evolving plot lines, dead end plot lines, and obfuscations that even with but a few minutes left in the broadcast keep you there on the front 2-3 inches of your sofa wondering what happened and who did the deed.

The man, Constable Morse (who another character calls, ""Oh like Morse code?""), is a man who does not have the answers, who spends time thinking, who tries to make sense of the people he meets, the acts they've performed, their lies, their secrets, and their overt and covert intentions for him. He leaves office politics to fester by ignoring blatant taunts and goads to argue, and instead focuses his mind on the case at hand.

He's not a physical character, and it's better for us that way.

What we can not understand though is why there are so many murders in the little English city of Oxford!",1419206400,,1204,4.63849765258216

This is one of the finest shows being done these days, with characters that are charming, for all the obvious reasons, but the appeal for me is the sheer humanity demonstrated by the actors - the groping for understanding, the fear of emotion, the disbelief at human callousness - brilliant!

5701560,5,B00C888NFQ,"A first rate series!  A great cast who expertly portray the various sides of police work - from the requisite attention to crime scene details to the more subjective and sometimes emotion driven deductions gleaned from suspect interviews and  witness recollections.
Mix in the inevitable police department personality clashes and you have a real winner !!
This is the Downtown Abby of the British detective genre.",1417392000,,413,5.242424242424242

5701574,5,B00C888NFQ,"The most intriguing mysteries I've seen in a long time. There is always a twist that keeps you off balance until the end. He has a dark side that keeps him from making rash judgments. Well produced, and acted. Great piece of work I'd highly recommend to anyone who likes a deep, thought provoking, bit of historical drama (set in the 1960's).",1417305600,,342,4.532258064516129

5701598,5,B00C888NFQ,"As with all the positive reviewers mentioned, I find this TV series to be among the most intriquing and satisfying BBC mystery shows I've ever watched.  Intellectually written script, wonderful dead-on casting particularly with Shaun Evans and Roger Allam in the lead roles, great acting, and detailed period staging make this series a truly engaging masterpiece.

In my view, one of the most brilliant factors that sets this series apart from all the rest of mystery/detective series that I've seen so far is the stunningly beautiful, sensuous, and poetic cinematography that renders the tone of the stories that are infused with great Classical, 60's Pop, and funky Jazz music.  The well-integrated cinematography and music alone give this series the first-rate ART FILM quality, which draws quick attention and keep audience engaged throughout the episodes.

I am really looking forward to watching the Season 2.",1416960000,,915,5.333333333333333

5701602,5,B00C888NFQ,"The mostly tightly written, tautly directed and edited, and expertly acted detective drama available. Sean Evans and Roger Allum create a bond and even a relationship despite Endeavor's difficulty with emotion and Thursday's practiced restraint. The characters are always moving forward as they attempt to tease out the truth in multi-layered plots. An emotional and intellectual treat. When does Season Three become available?",1416787200,,427,5.7936507936507935

5701605,5,B00C888NFQ,"I enjoyed this entire season.  You are drawn into not only the emotions and driving forces of the main character, but secondary characters are drawn out as well.  The mysteries are not easily solved and the acting is top notch.  I'd recommend.",1416700800,,243,4.738095238095238

5701607,5,B00C888NFQ,The only issue I have with Endeavour is there aren't more episodes. It's interesting to see Morse as a young man. It really answers a lot of questions from the Inspector Morse series. The downside is there aren't many episodes and it's a long wait for the next series.,1416700800,,268,4.489795918367347

5701630,5,B00C888NFQ,"I love the series.  The crotchety old Chief Constable, who is either corrupt or stupid.  Morse's chief, Thursday, who sometimes lacks backbone to stick up for him, but usually comes through in the end, one way or another.  The chain-smoking sidekick, who hates Morse and doesn't want him to succeed.  And the brilliant young Morse, who is so dedicated to his profession, who hardly sleeps, who sacrifices any private life for the good of the force and for catching the criminal. Besides being a great study in crime detection, the interplay of the characters makes the series so much more.",1416355200,,589,4.86

5701634,5,B00C888NFQ,"Another brilliant British series.  I never saw the original  Inspector Morse so all this is new to me, but from typical excellent acting to a plot line which keep you hooked to the very end, this is a cut above the normal fare dished out on the commercial channels.

5701638,5,B00C888NFQ,"Love this show! The Morse we know (from ""Morse"") is visible in ""Endeavour,"" and it's interesting to watch him develop, with Inspector Thursday's guidance. We learn more about his background, like the step-mother who didn't like him, how the other police officers viewed the young Morse, and the essentially kind -- but socially inept -- person he was. And, of course, the great stories, complete with dead ends, wrong assumptions, and the clues that only Morse could see and understand. All preposterous, but very entertaining.",1416009600,,527,5.211764705882353

I didn't find him very appealing in the original Inspector Morse.  That character seemed dark and  arrogant. This series has really interesting mysteries without all the gore and vulgarity found in so many other new programs.

plus, always a great ""soundtrack"" in that endeavor morse loves classical music.  BUT the music isn't so pervasive as to be annoying - my husband doesn't even notice.

here's a line written for the older series - ""Inspector Morse has an ear for music, a taste for beer and a nose for crime""

I like that Morse is a quiet police officer and yet ever thinking of the twists and out of place items that seemingly his other peers overlook.
Inspector Fred Thursday is also a great character and it is nice to watch the work between the two on the series.  Inspector Thursday is taking Morse under his wing to mold into a great inspector eventually.",1412812800,,519,4.608695652173913

5701976,5,B00C888NFQ,British TV is so much better than USA TV. Endeavour is a very good series about a young inspector Morse that observers minor details from one or more crime scenes and puts them together to solve the crime(s). Several of his colleagues think he is too young to be successful inspector - he needs more  experience but he always proves them wrong. Inspector Morse is Sherlock Holmesesque.,1411084800,,385,4.746268656716418

5702009,5,B00C888NFQ,"As a long time fan of the Inspectors Morse and Lewis Series, I was naturally intrigued by the concept:  How did Morse become Inspector Morse?  I've not been disappointed, that a comparable superior quality, placed in a different era, would make me an ardent Fan.  Rich visual content, amazing attention to period detail and costuming, intricate plot twists, and masterful, nuanced character development, revealed by the actors and production team are riveting!  Finding Colin Dexter, the series Author, in fleeting cameo appearances in each episode is an added delight.  Navigating carefully through a hostile career minefield, Shaun Evans, and his peerless Mentor, Roger Allam, have you cheering them on heartily.  Season 1 is most rewarding.  Viewing Season 2 is a Must!",1410566400,,772,5.330578512396694

Being a Morse fan, I couldn't imagine anyone besides John Thaw playing him, but Shaun Evans is marvelous! Not to mention Roger Allam as Fred Thursday and the rest of the stellar cast. I have enjoyed the episodes numerous times, even knowing the outcome, just because of the wonderful performances, the gorgeous scenery of Oxford and environs, and the amazing quality of the scripts. Best detective series since George Gently!",1410480000,,521,4.931818181818182

The acting in the main roles (Morse, Thursday, Frazil, Jakes, Strange) and in all the one-offs is very good.

5702046,4,B00C888NFQ,"I didn't know if I would like the prequel to Inspector Morse. John Thaw is such a hard actor to have to imitate in a role for which he is so famous. But the writing of this show is so well done, and the acting is so enjoyable to watch that it won me over. I particularly like that you can enjoy the show without having seen all of the episodes of Inspector Morse first. Some of the dialog is referencing old episodes, but not so much so that if someone has not seen it, he cannot follow along.
The reason it has four and not five stars is because of two things: his accent is wrong and his eyes are the wrong color. John Thaw, therefore Morse, had clear blue eyes. Shaun Evans does not. It was one of the most striking physical features of Morse, and I find it a bit distracting on the new actor. The second reason is the accent. Morse had a very distinct way of speaking that is not imitated by Evans. Maybe that will be explained or developed as the series continues. Both are minor things, I admit, and neither prevent me from shaping my evening around watching a new episode of Endeavour.",1410048000,,1092,4.204761904761905

5702124,5,B00C888NFQ,This is a very well written series. The plots have plenty of twists and turns. I enjoy the back stories for all the characters. Endeavour D.

5702125,4,B00C888NFQ,Very good series......sometimes a little slow........ Endeavour is treated badly but he seems to take it well..... wish he would have a little more backbone....but in the end he always shows the miserable old Captain and some of his other co-workers what's what..........trouble is......he doesn't get the credit for it.

5702190,5,B00C888NFQ,"I was a bit sceptical at first. Shaun Evans' appearance really bore so little resemblance to a younger John Thaw, I thought ""How is this going to work?"", but I was soon drawn into Evans' wonderful acting that I almost forgot about the lack of similarities. I liked his confidence towards his superiors, but also his sensitivity towards his witnesses and saw what the older Morse had sprung from, and of course his brilliant mind for collating facts and clues that no one else can recognize, except maybe his chief ""Thursday"", who is also superbly played by Roger Allam with just the right combination of officialdom and superiority, but still with understanding and, more to the point, his recognition of Morse's talents.
The plots are just SUPERB!! Dark, sombre, brooding and always with some kind of twist. It could almost be melodrama but for it appearing to be so 'real'. Real emotions, real settings, real people - this writing is just superb. I cannot recommend it highly enough, although it might take a few minutes for original Morse fans to get used to this younger character.",1408838400,,1085,4.838709677419355

5702212,3,B00C888NFQ,"There is a lot about this show I like, and some things I find appalling. First off, young Morse isn't very likable. He's not UN-likable either, but he's way too high strung and not much use for anything except Holmes style deductions and awkward interactions with women that are almost too painful to watch.

Still, Morse is a fountain of charisma compared to most of his co-workers, who demonstrate a comical, unbelievable level of stupidity that seems better suited to a sitcom than a serious drama. I guess this is supposed to make Morse look smarter, but it just makes the writers look snobby.

All that being said, some of the mysteries are really interesting, the music is beautiful and there is one thing that really elevates the show from annoying to decent, and that is Thursday. Thursday should be the actual star of the show, with Morse as his nerdy sidekick, and in any decent universe that's how it would be!

Thursday is brave, wise, and decent. Thursday also recognizes Morse's talent long before any of the Morlocks he works with. True, they occasionally try to paint him with the same brush they use for all the other people who aren't Morse, but they usually fail, which I credit to the actor's talent. Constable Strange is also a pretty good character out of an otherwise appalling lot.

In short, if you like a slightly snobby British mystery with some great opera, a slightly annoying main character, and a really great character who deserves better, try Endeavour!",1408665600,,1486,4.770428015564202

If you knew me, ""endeavor"" might be a keyword for me.
I know I smile a bit whenever the word appears.

As for the character -  As charming as he is  -  No one calls him ""Dev"" - if I am wrong and they do, and I missed it, tell me -  in fact, he should say that one time in these great stories - ""no one calls me Dev"" - is it because it sounds like ""short for devil"" ?  Or because he is just not a warm-fuzzy guy, or because.....

I like the stories - my son has worked and lives half the time in  London, UK and married a lady from Bristol on the sea. So I particularly like the stories that get me Googling UK sociology and history.",1408147200,,710,3.7364864864864864

5702295,5,B00C888NFQ,"I like the story-line and the characters. This series has a great way of maneuvering threads of suspense so that you cannot stand to miss a thing. If you do, you might miss a clue.

The characters are robust and real, especially the police that are trying to solve the mystery. The line-up of suspects is believable until the evidence proves them innocent of the crime,then the search for a new suspect begins...

This episode contained elements of music-related clues, made especially interesting due to the fact that one of the main characters happened to have a strong knowledge in this area which helped them all to seemingly better understand what the clues meant.",1408060800,,669,4.859649122807017

Morse is a brilliant mind but his colleagues don't take him seriously enough, even though he is the one that links seemingly random facts and evidence to catch the killer.  Morse drive comes from his need to solve the murder, not to get credit for solving the murder.  Very smart and well acted show!",1408060800,,349,4.596774193548387

What I am not crazy about is the lack of extras on it. Absolutely nothing on the disc but the movie itself. Also, and this really ticked me off, mostly at myself for not taking the time to read my options more carefully, this is also included in the Series 1 package, so if you're a fan, don't bother buying this, just buy the entire Series 1.

5702392,5,B00C888NFQ,"I like this series but it is hard to keep track of how many there are and whether I have seen them yet. The mirroring in the young Morse (including actually seeing John Thaw's face reflected in the rear view!) of the older Morse is well handled, the false steps and the opposition to his insistence that the police do not yet have the answer (which never changes as the character gets older, just the threatening superior), the equally false steps with women, which also never changes, the love of opera and music, all are present in Endeavour and so make it a treat for fans of the later Inspector Morse. One touching difference here is the mentorship/father-son dimension with the Roger (?) Allam character. I  also like the young Max and the young Morse having the same conversation!  More or these would be highly welcome to me and, I suspect, to all other fans who would have been happy to see many more seasons of Inspector Morse. Five stars!",1407369600,,948,4.570588235294117

5702484,3,B00C888NFQ,The story is good but very slow.  It could have been done in one hour instead of one and a half.,1406764800,,96,3.5714285714285716
5702485,5,B00C888NFQ,Was a great fan of Morse and John Thaw.  Not sure I would like Endeavour being played by a different person.  The votes have been cast and this is great.  Hope this series runs for a long time.  Shaun Evans is doing a fantastic job as Morse.,1406764800,,241,4.0638297872340425
5702486,5,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour is a well performed credible mystery series. Unlike Sherlock Holmes, Morse is a reasonably clever and also gregarious individual. His relationship with Inspector Thursday is based on mutual respect and a strong bond of friendship. Though there is a similarity in structure to the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, Endeavour is more credible and satisfying to watch.",1406764800,,368,5.589285714285714

5702488,5,B00C888NFQ,"We are into British cop shows and mysteries.  If you've ever watched Inspector Morse, which has been on for years, you'll already know that Endeavour Morse is Inspector Morse when he was much younger.  We actually feel that this show is even better than the original Inspector Morse.  We also enjoy that, like Inspector Morse, these stories are told without profanity.",1406678400,,368,5.0

5702490,5,B00C888NFQ,"PBS always does a great job with murder mystery. The second season
was as good as the first. Clever plots and logic are used to keep you

5702494,5,B00C888NFQ,"We never thought the essence of Inspector Morris would ever be captured by prequels and sequels.  But in both Lewis and Endeavor, the writing of Collin Dexter is captured.  Both Season One and Season Two of Endeavor are amazing.  Hold on to your seat at the ending of Season Two.  It is unexpected.  If you watch in the evening, plan not to go to bed early!",1406678400,,357,4.348484848484849

5702506,5,B00C888NFQ,"After watching the Pilot, I wasn't so sure about the rest of the series. The pilot does drag a bit, but I just sat here and watched the whole first season in one day. (It is a good way to procrastinate). I think Shaun Evans does a great job as Morse. He is so very stoic, but you can see how he really feels with his eyes. All of the supporting cast are awesome as well. I really like Thursday's family.",1406505600,,403,3.9876543209876543

5702534,5,B00C888NFQ,"Thoroughly enjoy this series (and the second season is even better!). What's not to like. The characters are interesting and the actors are perfect in their roles. The puzzles are multi-faceted and steeped in human relationships, emotions, and entangled lives. Love every aspect of it and when watching again and again, even more is revealed as one turns from the murder toward the relationships of those solving it. One of the best series -- dare I say even better than Inspector Morse....",1406419200,,490,4.987804878048781
5702535,5,B00C888NFQ,I like inspector morse and his mentor.  My favorite shows have likeable main characters.  These certainly are at the top of  my list.

5702536,5,B00C888NFQ,"Great series!  I had to use the closed caption option until my southern ears got used to the accents.  Be sure to watch the ""Endeavour"" a stand-alone episode before you begin Season one.  This will give you some backgound on him and introduce a few of the ongoing characters.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1406419200,,312,4.327586206896552
5702537,5,B00C888NFQ,As a fan of Colin Dexter's work and a mystery buff I enjoy Masterpiece programs. I enjoyed John Thaw as the older Inspector Morse and now get to enjoy a younger Morse. I find the younger Morse to be edgier and less refined than the older Morse which is as it should be. I am looking forward to more Endeavour episodes on PBS and Prime.,1406332800,,335,4.1692307692307695

I didn't see the ""Inspector Morse"" mysteries that aired in the 80's so I am enjoying watching these prequel mysteries set when he was supposedly 20 years or so younger. I'm getting to know him from the beginning and I feel another love affair coming on.  Since Ordering this set, I ordered and watched the original Inspector Morse Season 1 for the first time and have found myself in mystery heaven! I fell in love with Inspector Lewis and now I can see how HE came into the life of Inspector Morse. I love these.  The writer of these stories should be commended over and over for the entertainment he provides. Thanks Amazon for making the original series available and for this season of Endeavour. As always, I appreciate your continuing ability to provide what I want at a price I can afford.",1406160000,,879,4.621794871794871

5702655,5,B00C888NFQ,"My wife and I approached this series with caution. Having been great lovers of Morse, we were afraid that this prequel would be but a pale shadow of the original series. Much to our surprise, that turned out not to be the case.

Shaun Evans, as the young Morse, is perfectly cast. He's awkward and socially inept, sensitive and refined in a world where those qualities are a liability, but determined and brilliant in pursuing solutions to baffling crimes. He is wonderfully complemented by the great Roger Allam, complete with magnificent bass Shakespearean voice (though modern accent) as the inspector who regards Morse as his protege and has just the right mixture of patrician firmness and willingness to allow Morse to follow his instincts.

The stories are good, the crimes challenging and the outcomes satisfying. A superior British police procedural which fully deserves to stand on its own merit rather than just an appendage of the marvelous original.",1405900800,,962,5.082278481012659

5702752,5,B00C888NFQ,"As a great admirer of both the Colin Dexter novels and the original Morse series, I had trepidation about this series.  After all, other than the piercing blue eyes Shaun Evans looks nothing like a young John Thaw, and upon first watching the pilot it was obvious that Evans's accent is quite different from Thaw's.  That having been said, I now love this series even more than the first (blasphemy!).  Not only is Shaun Evans utterly fascinating as the young, incredibly driven and emotionally vulnerable Morse, but Roger Allam as Detective Inspector Thursday is a gem.  The series would be worth watching just for Allam, but the interplay between Morse and Endeavor is not to be missed.  The only difficulty I have is, though I'm an unstoppable Anglophile, I just can't understand everything the characters say.  So I have to hit replay.  What a tragedy (not).  I hit replay just to re-watch the expressions on the actors' faces.  Are the story lines improbable?  Of course!  But if that were a barrier to great mystery, Sherlock Holmes would never have caught on.  Bravo to the BBC and to everyone in this wonderful series.  And just to say, it is a thrill to see John Thaw's daughter in it as well.  So many of us miss John Thaw terribly, and while this series doesn't even try to replace him (and it shouldn't), it does a superb job of going back in time and setting the stage.",1405555200,,1382,4.610655737704918
5702753,5,B00C888NFQ,"This ""prequel"" to the superb ""Inspector Morse"" British mystery series stands solidly on its own merits. ""Endeavor"" -- the first name of the young Detective Constable Morse -- is clearly the brightest and most intuitive detective in the Oxford office. Morse is taken under the wing of Chief Inspector Thursday, who will help him develop the much-needed skills and experience to use his natural gifts to best advantage.
As with ""Inspector Morse"" and its sequel ""Inspector Lewis"", the show is set in Oxford and the cinematography uses the unique and photogenic architecture of the university to good advantage.
Brilliantly written and superbly acted, ""Endeavor"" promises to become another classic in the series.",1405555200,,708,5.330357142857143

It is nice to see a story about someone in the process of becoming a great detective as opposed to Sherlock where he is cockily good at solving crimes already (not that we don't love Sherlock as well, we do).

5702855,5,B00C888NFQ,"We always enjoyed the Morse series and then the Lewis follow-on. I love how Endeavour ties in so well with threads from the original books/series and provides plausible background for the Morse character in the original series. Endeavour has definitely exceeded my expectations from when I first heard that a ""prequel"" was being developed. Shaun Evans does an outstanding job of portraying the young Morse, showing  his tenderness and vulnerability, the arrogance of his curious extremely intelligent mind, and the flashes of impatience and irritability which become more and more encrusted as a defense mechanism as Morse ages into the character we meet as DCI Morse. We are currently watching Season 2 and will very much look forward to a Season 3 if/when produced.",1405296000,,767,5.185483870967742

5702866,5,B00C888NFQ,Excellent! Shaun Evans was perfectly cast as Morse. Prequels and sequels usually don't appeal to me but I wanted to see where this prequel would lead. It led to some very entertaining shows and answered a few questions that I had for the original series. Evans displays the same ability as original Morse; to size up a crime and then to follow his instincts to resolving a mystery. I have always considered Inspector Morse the standard by which all other TV crime shows are judged. It appears as if the new series will continue a fine tradition.,1405209600,,545,4.628865979381444

Shaun Evans is adorable as Morse, a detective who lacks social skills, but is a brilliant detective.  He is a fine actor, very serious, which is what the character is about.  My favorite is DI Thursday (Roger Allam), his boss, he gives some comic relief to a serious show.  He is very entertaining!!
  The stories are a little drawn out and melodramatic, and it isn't as entertaining as Sherlock, which, to me sets the bar for Masterpiece Mystery, however it is an entertaining program with good acting and engaging stories.  The fun thing about the show is that it is done by good old fashioned police work- no DNA, no cell phones, no computers.  All ""old school"".  The backdrop of Oxford is amazing, and the music in the show is wonderful too. Morse loves opera, he is an interesting multi-layered character.  I never watched the Morse series, Endeavour is a prequel.  Wonderful show!",1404777600,,964,4.712574850299402

5703095,5,B00C888NFQ,"We have been huge fans of Morse, Inspector Lewis and now Endeavour. The characters in all three are believable and the mysteries are well written. Most are based on Oxford academia and are filmed in the delightful area o Oxford. Now as we watch Endeavour, we see how Morse became the man he was. When he was shot in episode 3, series one the Dr told him he would probably limp in later life. My wife and I exclaimed, ""that's Morse got his limp in later life!"" Very enjoyable and would recommend to all, especially ""Morse Junkies""",1404432000,,529,4.463917525773196

5703098,4,B00C888NFQ,"The young Inspector Morse as played by Shaun Evans takes some getting used to, particularly because he looks so very young to be so weighted with the personality of the older Morse.  While keeping traits of the character established by John Thaw, Evans does not mimic Thaw's performance but does give us a man in whom it is possible to see the older inspector to come.  It must be a tough job for any actor to establish his own interpretation of a character within the confines of another actor's performance.  Evans seems up to the task.  I enjoyed these first episodes, and in Series 2, Evans and a strong supporting cast of regulars do a good job of creating the unique ""world"" of Detective Constable Morse.  By the way, I was struck by the facial resemblance of Shaun Evans to Jack Nicholson when Nicholson was young and handsome (take a look at ""Chinatown"").",1404432000,,863,4.61437908496732

5703105,4,B00C888NFQ,Really deep and meaningful characterization provides this introduction the young Morse with compelling appeal. You almost do not need the mystery but of course it is complex and enjoyable. The writing is rich and the production is well staged.

Another winner detective series.",1404259200,,327,5.52
5703110,4,B00C888NFQ,"Really enjoyed this show.  All comes together at the end of each episode.  I had to watch it with closed caption in order not to miss any dialogue.  However, there are some bits of dialogue that I did not fully understand.  Perhaps slang.  A very enjoyable show.  I started watching it because I watched Foyle's War which I really enjoyed.  Highly recommend it.",1404259200,,361,4.634920634920635

5703126,5,B00C888NFQ,"Where they find these younger actors to portray earlier versions of established characters, I do not know but they nailed it with Endeavour. Inspector Morse always had such a melancholy air. You can see it's emergence in this series. The tension between Morse and other detectives arises from his misfit personality, intelligence and extreme commitment to solving each crime - he is almost regarded as an ""apple polisher"" though his relationship with Thursday is far from it. He is more like a lost soul with a singular ability to see things others miss. Thursday recognizes this and nurtures it without appearing to favor him in every situation. I always enjoy learning the backstory to favorite characters and this series does it so well while providing intriguing mysteries to unravel.",1404086400,,788,5.116279069767442
5703127,5,B00C888NFQ,"Complex plot that keeps you unsure of outcome. Sometimes twists in story seem convoluted may be somewhat confusion.

5703142,5,B00C888NFQ,"This is so well done for a young Morse. It's not as dark, has great plots and begins early to show the talent and great mind that is learning and growing into a gifted detective. I love the time period, the English everything, and the actor who plays Morse, this
 main character, for such a young man, is more thoughtful and into opera, which is non typical of most youth, even in his time, and it begins to set up his iron sharpening iron with his superiors and his ability to overcome it. That makes it worth the time to watch.",1403827200,,529,4.237623762376238

5703144,5,B00C888NFQ,"Great actors let us see how Morse became Morse. But I think the mysteries are better in this new series and the use of spectacular opera music gives it the perfect atmosphere.

5703145,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series is true to the tradition of BBC Masterpiece.  The characters are well played, understated and interesting. I like the young Morse more than the original!

I've re-watched the first few seasons just to refresh my memory of the earlier/older Morse and, besides the wonderfully acted parts, I think the dynamic between Thursday and Morse and the characteristics that we see on the older Morse just developing with the younger make it a pleasurable watch.

The pacing is somewhat slow for action-adventure fans but the resulting space for consideration and projection of the plot line provides a welcomed relief and gratification for seeing the potential twists instead of being forced to accept, unexamined, the choices of the director.",1403395200,,347,5.566037735849057

5703175,4,B00C888NFQ,I really enjoyed this Show as it looks back at the younger years of Morse and his journey into the job of police work and Detective work within the Good 'ol boy network. It also slowly gives you nuggets of the layers that make up his Boss Chief Detective Thursday. It fills in many holes on both the softer side of Morris as an older man and the wounds of His wife Joan's death. It looks like  this will be slowly laid out for us as well. The characters are deep and well written and I can't wait to see season two. This is well worth an evening in!,1403308800,,549,4.036697247706422
5703176,5,B00C888NFQ,Have watched 2 episodes and love the intrigue and mystery of this series. Looking forward to future episodes and trying to unravel the mysteries!,1403308800,,145,5.083333333333333
5703177,4,B00C888NFQ,"I have enjoyed watching the series, but the music is a big distraction for me. I know Morris likes music, but it's too loud especially on the first episode. I almost stopped watching it because of the music. The music in the rest of the episodes is not a bad as the first. I had a problem understanding some of the dialogue, but that's mainly because it's a British series.",1403308800,,373,4.3428571428571425
5703178,5,B00C888NFQ,Intriguing. Watched the whole season in a week. Had only watched inspector Lewis before. The plot and the actors draw you into the story.,1403222400,,137,4.75

5703181,5,B00C888NFQ,"This will satisfy a lot of people.

Great writing.  Great characters, Great plots. Detective mystery.  Coming of age drama.  Prequel of popular Inspector Morse (which I never saw) series which stands up on its own.",1403222400,,214,5.0285714285714285
5703182,5,B00C888NFQ,"I'm a huge fan of period drama, but I almost missed this more modern series because it wasn't my usual thing. Not a corset or cravat in sight. Lacking anything to watch between seasons of Downton Abbey and Mr Selfridge, I decided to give Endeavour a shot. Set in the mid-1960s, Endeavour is the prequel to the Inspector Morse series. As a caveat, I have no prior experience with anything to do with Inspector Morse, but I am not opposed to a good murder mystery and love the Agatha Christie Poirot series in particular.  To my surprise I was quickly and completely sucked into Endeavour. The script has been brilliantly written, playing out the complicated plot-lines beautifully. This is not a series you watch while working a crossword, or doing your needlework. You have to pay attention or you miss something. Shaun Evans plays the young Inspector Morse and I quickly came to like him. He's brilliantly clever and a real 'outside the box' thinker. You find yourself inspecting the crime scene or the scenery much as he does, looking for the unexpected. Morse is also a man with a great many ghosts haunting him, and piece by piece, you learn about these ghosts, sympathize with him, and feel sad for him. While brilliant, he strikes me as a very lonely person. A very believable character played with great emotion and skill. I also enjoyed Roger Allam's portrayal as Detective Inspector Fred Thursday, who seems to stand in the role of a father figure as well as a mentor to Morse. Looking forward to season two.",1403222400,,1517,4.703007518796992

5703189,5,B00C888NFQ,I chose to give this 5 stars because the writing and acting is superb.  I was drawn in within the first 10 minutes and now I'm hooked.

It is an excellent portrayal of a young detective who marches to his own drum and not always at the pleasure of his superiors!

5703257,5,B00C888NFQ,"I did not expect to enjoy this series as much as I did.  First off, the main character is a dead ringer for Herman from ""Herman's Hermits"" (an English band from the 60's British invasion, for those of you much younger than myself).  He is young, vulnerable, kind, and sports a messy shaggy hair cut.  Its tempting to dismiss him as a lightweight, but as the stories develop we see that he actually has some depth and grit.  He is forthright and persistent.  He allows others to underestimate him and even bully him while he just plods along, doggedly pursuing his target.  Meanwhile his mentor (a much older detective) is equally tough and used to being the underdog, condescended to by his superiors.  We see that while he is their intellectual better, he never asserts himself, knowing that in doing so he may forfeit the chance to succeed in his hunt for the mark.  All the while, the young detective watches his example and carefully files away what he needs to know for the day when he has his own opportunity to shine.  This is a fun series which takes a little time to allow the characters to develop, but the end result is well worth it.",1402358400,,1145,4.492753623188406
5703258,4,B00C888NFQ,This was a good series. It's an interesting take on Morse's earlier career and the man who influenced him. I will watch Season Two when it's free. I have still to watch the Endeavor movie but will do that soon.,1402358400,,210,4.275

I suspect I wasn't alone because PBS announced this new series. The main character is DC  Morse, at the beginning of his career as a policeman in Cambridge.  It's beautifully done: the writing, scenery, and music.  Endeavour, a character who is  enigmatic, brilliant and socially inept is a captivating subject.  Shaun Evans as Morse and Roger Allam as DI Fred Thursday are wonderful in their respective roles and the supporting cast is ""spot on"".",1402358400,,645,4.747747747747748

5703314,5,B00C888NFQ,"The wife got me hooked on the Morse series she'd check out from the library and then she mentioned that with Mother's Day coming up getting the prequel series ""Endeavour"" might be equally captivating. I had seen the pilot she checked out from our local library, but they didn't have anything beyond the pilot. So one of our children managed to get her the first season, which we finished watching. I have really enjoyed it...too bad it ended so soon! Watching how the young Morse evolved into the old Morse has been fun. I look forward to season two!",1400889600,,550,4.565656565656566

5703331,5,B00C888NFQ,"Inspector Morse is wonderfully quirky genius, able to solve the confounding murders much to the dismay of the less brilliant police cohort.  He is chip ones by his superior, Chief Thursday who is a wise mentor. Morse loves opera and beautiful women but he is not a playboy.

5703338,5,B00C888NFQ,Being an Inspector Morse fan this was a perfect dvd.  To see Morse as a young man honing his skills.  He is not as smooth as his later years.

Well done.,1400457600,,323,4.0476190476190474
5703339,4,B00C888NFQ,"Like his older persona in the 'Morse' series, Endeavor shows an intuition that makes him an effective policeman, if not one who always colors within the lines. The episodes are dark, with complex characters  whose intertwinings make for good drama. The best parts remain the interpersonal relationships among the police. P.D. James is called to mind.",1400284800,,350,5.25

5703348,5,B00C888NFQ,I love this series.  I can't wait for season two to be able.  The actor does a wonderful portrayal of Inspector Morse in his earlier years.  His methodology in solving crimes is outside the box and accurate which creates jealousy and backstabbling with his closed minded peers but he perseveres and gets results.  It's a good thing his boss recognizes his talents and supports him.,1400025600,,381,4.815384615384615

5703350,5,B00C888NFQ,"There are times when you watch a TV show or a film and within the first few minutes you know you are in good hands.  You sense that you can trust that what you are about to see has been created with care and integrity and craft.  Endeavour is a joy to watch  exciting, clever, well-paced and character-driven.  There is a fascination and a bit of sadness as we watch young Morse on his arc to becoming Inspector Morse.  Persistence, insatiability, fallibility.  He moves forward and upward, but winds up isolating himself.  What could have been ham-fisted story-telling in lesser hands, is a truly wonderful show.  I'd rate this with the classics: Morse, Prime Suspect and Cracker, and with my other new favorite British show, Sherlock.  And season 2 is even better!",1399939200,,766,4.742424242424242

5703362,5,B00C888NFQ,"This show has been written as a prequel to the great Inspector Morse series, which starred the late John Thaw. While at first I did not see a physical resemblance in the age- differentiated character of young Morse, played by Shaun Evans, I was quickly sucked in to the plot and character development.

5703364,5,B00C888NFQ,If you like historical drama with your crime mysteries then this is the show for you! Endeavour has that charm that draws you in and makes you want to find out more.

5703366,5,B00C888NFQ,I wish they would have made more than one season. Love the flashback to Oxford in the 60's!!  This show is good for all audiences over 12. No swearing no blood or gore just a good old fashioned mystery.,1399680000,,202,4.17948717948718

5703369,4,B00C888NFQ,"My wife and I enjoyed these a lot.  The only problem was, because these are English and we are Americans, some of the dialog was hard to understand due to the accents.

As a young man, he didn't do everything right and had many rough edges (as far as his superiors were concerned).  He had many prejudices against him to overcome because he hadn't what was considered the ""right"" background.  His persistence and fresh perspective solved the cases, mostly despite his superiors.

I must admit that I might be the only one that is put off by the rather loud classical music that is played throughout most of the background.  I do not appreciate opera the way some others might, especially the ones he seems to be interested in, so for me all I need to do is turn it down until they are speaking again.

5703425,1,B00C888NFQ,I was at first very eager to see this ... and then I experienced this and was amazed by the wasted talent of the cast with such drivel they were given. ..,1398556800,,154,3.84375
5703426,5,B00C888NFQ,"loved the building of suspense, and plot twists. the filming shots and angles enhance the beautiful backdrop of Cambridge. h ighly recommend",1398470400,,140,5.409090909090909
5703427,4,B00C888NFQ,The story was intriguing and how the detective goes about finding clues was interesting.  It was a little difficult to understand the words because of the British English.  Closed caption would help tremendously.  We would recommend this mystery.,1398470400,,246,5.421052631578948
5703428,5,B00C888NFQ,"I'm not at all familiar with the series to which this is the prequel, but if past is prologue, or vice-verse, we got a good thing going here.",1398384000,,141,4.071428571428571
5703429,5,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour is another great prequel!  The younger Morse hasn't gained his footing amongst the staid and rigid thinking of his peers, except for his superior, who sees Endeavour's brilliance and keeps him on, regardless the price he pays from time to time.",1398297600,,254,5.0476190476190474
5703430,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well written and well acted, I hope that it will continue. I was a big fan of John Thaw in the original series.  The young  Morse is less cynical, but quirky. I love that he is into classical music and sings in a choir, just like the older Morse.",1398297600,,246,4.0
5703441,5,B00C888NFQ,This is a great series and provides insights into the Morse shows.  I can't wait for series 2 to arrive.,1398297600,,104,4.2

shoes in portraying a young Morse.",1398297600,,106,4.3
5703443,5,B00C888NFQ,Always enjoyed the Masterpiece shows.  Have seen all of the Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis episodes and it's interesting to see how Morse started out.  Enjoyed all of the episodes I've seen so far.,1398211200,,202,4.911764705882353
5703444,5,B00C888NFQ,"I'm not sure if because I came to Inspector Morse after it had been out for some time, but I am enjoying Endeavor so much more.  Looking forward to the next installment.  The cast is FABULOUS.",1398211200,,192,4.305555555555555
5703445,5,B00C888NFQ,"I tried it because I like mysteries from England, I was not disappointed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the character of a young Morse, the actor played a very convincing annoyed young detective annoyed with the system.  I hope there will be more coming.",1398211200,,246,4.833333333333333
5703446,4,B00C888NFQ,This series was a little slow moving but the central character was compelling. The more I watched it the more I liked it!!,1398211200,,122,4.3478260869565215
5703447,5,B00C888NFQ,"Beautiful cinematography, great acting and intricate but believable plots.  Caveat:  for American viewers the ability to display subtitles will probably be essential for understanding the British accents and idioms.",1398211200,,215,6.379310344827586

5703449,5,B00C888NFQ,"I love this series.  There is nothing formulaic or predictable about it. The characters are beautifully developed, but all have enough secrets to be completely credible.  Being human is complicated.  The situations in each episode get that without over explaining.  Challenging mysteries. Complex and restrained relationships. I will be buying this series, and waiting very impatiently for the next season.",1398038400,,406,5.716666666666667
5703450,5,B00C888NFQ,Hope this series will go past season one as it is very enjoyable.  The character of Morse is great to see in his early years.,1398038400,,125,4.0

5703463,5,B00C888NFQ,Endeavour is a great story that is well acted and surrounded by the beauty of England's countryside. They lean a bit to the melancholy side of things but you will find yourself caring about the characters and wondering what brought them to this point. I wish there were many seasons of this wonderful class conflicted series.,1398038400,,325,4.821428571428571
5703464,4,B00C888NFQ,"Manages to present and interesting view of the family, cultural and social experiences that shaped the mature Morris while not hampering the reason I watch inspector Morris, i.e. to enjoy his intellectual pursuit of the culprit using incomplete and, at times seemingly trivial pieces of information that he gathers on his pool of suspects.",1398038400,,339,5.296296296296297
5703465,4,B00C888NFQ,Seems to remain true to Morse character.  Built on hints we have about John Thaw's representation of the Morse character.,1398038400,,121,5.05
5703466,3,B00C888NFQ,hard to follow their lanuage and understand with the speed they speak.  My husband quit part way through due to lanuage,1398038400,,119,4.666666666666667
5703467,4,B00C888NFQ,"I really enjoyed this show and would recommend it, especially if you enjoy period British crime dramas.
It's a prequel to the Inspector Morse series but I don't believe you need to see the first in order to enjoy this one.",1397952000,,222,4.439024390243903
5703468,3,B00C888NFQ,A good show to watch after you've watched all your prime shows. A little slow moving but exciting nonetheless. I would have liked to know more on the main character's back story.,1397865600,,178,4.59375
5703469,5,B00C888NFQ,Really enjoying watching this series.  Like the characters and the twists and turns that come out through Morse's deductive process.,1397779200,,132,5.6

5703472,5,B00C888NFQ,"Excellent series. I wish there were more than only three episodes available. The uncooperative  rivalry of peers and the dominance of superiors was well stingily portrayed.
Streamed without incident.",1397692800,,199,5.862068965517241

5703474,5,B00C888NFQ,"This is excellent.  Yes, it moves at a slow pace, but that is typical of many British detective plots.  However, the crimes, and the eventual solutions, are very interesting.  And the character development of a new, young crime solver is very well done.",1397606400,,253,4.837209302325581

5703478,5,B00C888NFQ,I can't wait to see the second season.  I've loved the Inspector Lewis series and Inspector Morse as well.  The added delight of period Oxford was an added inducement to my enjoyment.,1397520000,,183,4.6875
5703479,5,B00C888NFQ,"Shaun Evans presents the troubled Morse with the proper confusion, cleverness and curiosity. The partnership between Morse and Thursday is brilliant. I look forward to more Endeavour!",1397520000,,183,5.814814814814815
5703480,3,B00C888NFQ,"Some British actors I can understand and some are just a bit too strong with the British speech pattern for my American ear to catch.  The actors in this show are mostly in the latter category.  Could understand only about half of the lines.  Show had decent production values, but the story was run-of-the-mill.  Suggest trying out ""Foyles War"" first if you haven't seen that one.",1397433600,,381,4.7272727272727275

5703493,5,B00C888NFQ,Absolutely love this series of Inspector Morse when he was young.  Stunning cinematography and superb character selection.  Young Morse does an incredible job of acting and making you fall in love with his complex and conflicted character.  Pure genius!,1397260800,,253,5.435897435897436
5703494,5,B00C888NFQ,I haven't watched the series with the grown-up Morse.  This one stands on its own.  Terrific period piece.  Outstanding performances.,1397260800,,133,5.55
5703495,5,B00C888NFQ,This explains why Morse turned out like he did. I wish this series would have come out first.  All in all an excellent addition to the Morse series.,1397174400,,148,4.285714285714286

5703499,5,B00C888NFQ,"My personal enjoyment of detectives who can solve a great crime while dealing with their own issues is certainly found here with Endeavor.  As is follow Morse when he first arrived at Oxford.  The somewhat awkward young Morse trying to fit in the the police constabulary, while many others are baulking at his 'crazy' theories, which often prove true.
I love the Oxford setting, as I do in the other series and I love the use of music to set the tones.",1397088000,,452,4.5
5703500,5,B00C888NFQ,One of the best. PLEASE make more! I can never guess who dunnit! This show/series is incredibly well done and more than worthy of more than five stars.,1397088000,,151,4.428571428571429

5703519,4,B00C888NFQ,Endeavour is prequel to the later Morse stories. It captures the period and the cultural values and nuances well and is an absorbing and original story.,1396828800,,152,4.884615384615385

5703521,5,B00C888NFQ,This is the most intelligent show that I have seen in a long time.  Masterpiece does it again.  They consistently air well written and well acted shows.  Endeavour is clever and not overdone with emoting or excessive special effects.  The classical music is hauntingly beautiful and adds so much to the plot and lead character.,1396742400,,327,4.890909090909091
5703522,5,B00C888NFQ,"The series is terrific, with really good performances and excellent writing and photography. The direction is consistently good in each installment.

5703524,5,B00C888NFQ,"Very good introduction to police officer with acute observation, reasoning and deductive skills - which cause jealousy or admiration in the ranks of his co-workers and supervisors.

5703530,5,B00C888NFQ,"I came to Morse very late - actually this year.  I am pleased that I am meeting Endeavour in a much more timely fashion.  The series is well produced, directed and the acting is outstanding.  I have been alternately watching Endeavour and Morse episdoes and it is interesting to watch the older Morse episodes and note the contrasts between the two time frames of the same life.  I highly recommend this seried to any Morse enthusiast, be they new or well established.",1396483200,,468,4.670731707317073

5703546,4,B00C888NFQ,"First off, I'm disappointed that Amazon Prime is not offering Season 2 at this time. I loved the movie and have watched Season 1 and now... no season 2. This is a typical Masterpiece Theater offering. A bit slow moving if you are not a fan of English theater, but that's what I like. All of the episodes were well-done and sublimely acted by Shaun Evans. If you are in the market for interesting characters, intricately-woven plots, good writing, then the Endeavour series if made for you.",1396396800,,489,4.632183908045977

5703548,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series is one of my all-time favorites. I can see the elder Morse in this young man. I enjoy this thoughtfulness, his hidden emotions, but most of all his intellect. Definitely worth watching, in fact, I have watched all of the episodes Twice.",1396224000,,248,4.659090909090909

5703560,2,B00C888NFQ,"I am no as impressed with the person playing Morse. He just isn't believable.

No one can beat John Thaw as Morse. And I liked the way Morse and Lewis inner act.",1395878400,,253,4.08

5703583,5,B00C888NFQ,"Young Detective Constable Morse is really great in this series. He is a bit uncertain, but sees more than anyone else. As a past Oxford student, he knows his way around; however, he did not finish, and has painful memories. This is quite different from the Chief Inspector Morse series, but I like them both.",1395878400,,308,4.618181818181818

Roger Allam's, Fred Thursday, is mesmerizing.  I stumbled upon this through Amazon Prime and was able to watch for free, but it is worth buying or renting if you aren't a Prime member.  I am looking forward to the next season.",1395792000,,392,4.542857142857143
5703585,4,B00C888NFQ,This series explains a lot about what made up the psychology of DCI Morse.  It looks at how a not fully developed Inspector Morse works his way around a police bureaucracy and decides if this is the life for him.,1395792000,,212,4.3

5703603,5,B00C888NFQ,Call me old.  I have taken a shine to British detective programs.  There is much less sensationalism than US television programming and much more plot development.  Endeavor is classic whodunit with great casting and locations.  I like it.,1395446400,,239,5.2105263157894735

5703634,3,B00C888NFQ,"I may go back to take a second look at this series. But my first impression was that it was very slow in establishing the story line. Characters were written well but again they were slow in delivery, (almost like the story was meant to be a little on the mundane side of things. Sometimes this tack can add to the drama of an episode but in this case it did not. (FOR ME) I found myself getting tired of waiting for the content to pick up and deliver a more interesting view of things. So I simply stopped the episode and went to another show to watch. I have to take into account that it may just have been my mood at the time, that is why I stated in the beginning that I would probabbly give it another look and watch a little more to see if it actually picks up and or see if the the character and story line draw me in more.",1395014400,,830,3.9760479041916166

5703668,5,B00C888NFQ,"What I really like about English crime shows--whether a time piece (like this) or not--is that they, as a rule, are more about the motivation of the crime and about the logic behind the solution than the car chase. And they are often also about good dialogue and character development. Just like a book.

I know that you must be a lover of books to see my heading as praise, but it is, for I enjoy few things as much as a good book.

5703670,5,B00C888NFQ,"Not since Ricky Nelson tested his parents has television captured so naturally the charisma of youthful wit and instinct. The pairing of Evans and Allam resonates probably especially with viewers who remember the latter's performance as chief of staff to Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II, in the movie from Stephen Frears. In the series pilot, Evans less ""arrives"" than is declared, in profile internally musing to choral strains of ""in Paradisum"" from the Requiem of Gabriel Faur, against a backdrop of Oxford vistas. This must be ranked among the more privileged entrances ever envisioned, but the actor and the script live up to it. My impression is that this is television for mature audiences, so steeped in allusion and crafted with such treasuring of real mystery as to document and celebrate an entire sensibility. At the same time, I cannot say that I've seen anyone enact any better than Evans, the anxious pursuit of understanding - not Dean for Nicholas Ray or Brando for Elia Kazan or Grant for Hitchcock. He suggests Jean-Pierre Laud for Truffaut, especially in the last frame from ""The 400 Blows,"" and he is as anarchically male as the lot of them.",1394755200,,1164,4.9438775510204085
5703681,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series was so well done.  Each and every character is carefully developed over the course of each mystery.  Every episode keeps you guessing.  Endeavour's character and personality are slowly revealed in complex layers, allowing us to see why he thinks differently than the other detectives.  Those who do listen to him, begin to realize he ""just may have something.""  Although there are some who don't take kindly to his views or the way he takes over, in a manner of speaking.  He can't seem to stop himself.  He always thinking and subconciously evaluating everything evolving around the ""murder.""  A bit like Sherlock, but extremely likable and vulnerable at the same time.

5703807,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have never watched the original Morse, but enjoyed this show immensely, so If you're like  me  - a novice, don't worry about it and just jump right in.

This series follows young Morse, an intelligent and somewhat over qualified police officer in 1960's Oxford. There are 4 stand alone episodes in which Morse solves intricate crimes, much to the annoyance and envy of his less qualified colleagues, and his  overbearing  captain. The only one who recognises his talent and tries to support him is Inspector Fred Friday, a seasoned detective and a fascinating character in It's own right. Roger Allam who plays Inspector Friday gives a fabulous performance, especially in the comical parts where he  ""scolds"" young Morse for being too bright for his own good, advising him to keep his head down and his insightful observation to himself and pretend to be just another mediocre block like the rest.

What fascinated me most about this show is not the crime plots ( though they're pretty good) but the mystery and the questions surrounding Morse and the reasons which brought him to the police force. The atmosphere of of the show is somewhat melancholic, as we slowly reveal those reasons have something to do with a great loss and yearning for something unattainable. Shaun Evans portrays Morse as a young man by his years but already disillusioned with life and indifferent to his own fate like a much older man, with great sensitivity. I personally felt a need to give him a big hug, so gloomy and  removed from everyone else he always seems.

Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, melancholic, and touching.",1393286400,,1603,4.885608856088561

5703810,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well done!  We miss the senior Morse and, with this ""first"" season now we get to see how and why he got up the ranks.

5703822,5,B00C888NFQ,"I certainly hope that there are future installments in this series.

Although each of the four episodes is fully capable of standing on its' own, when sown together, they create a fuller picture of the characters.  With the continuity of primary players then, comes a better understanding of their history, and what drives their behavior and personalities.  If you read this review prior to watching the four episodes, begin by watching what is ostensibly the pilot movie.  Although not identified as such, it is a bit of a base on which this series is built.  Find it here on Amazon as "" Masterpiece Mystery: Endeavour Starring Shaun Evans""

The writing is excellent, as are the portrayals by all of the actors, whether transient or continuing.  Set in the mid-1960's Oxford, England, I find the sets, politics, and societal tone of the era to be well identified.  The plots are interesting and engrossing.  Frankly, I am at this time sorry that there is not another episode to watch tomorrow, and another the day after that.  I'm hooked.  You will be too, as long as you are not expecting an American style shoot 'em up police story.",1393113600,,1135,4.769230769230769

5703825,5,B00C888NFQ,"The Endeavor series is far superior to the Morse series from which it sprang.  The acting is wonderfully done and the story lines twist enough to keep the most avid mystery buff on the edge of his seat.  You feel the angst of young Morse as he deals with the political small mindedness of upper management and cheer as he inevitably figures out the tangle of crime, much to the consternation of the top brass, who jealously want to remind him of ""his place' as lowly constable.

5703840,4,B00C888NFQ,"Young Morse has an extremely analytical mind that allows him to pick up clues that others miss.  His awkward demeanor makes him a little bit of a strange duck in the world of detectives, but he can't be intimidated.",1393113600,,215,4.512820512820513
5703841,5,B00C888NFQ,"For those of us that adored the Inspector Morse series, Endeavor is like receiving a gift.  The acting is terrific and so many of the elder Morse's quirks come to life in Endeavor.",1393113600,,180,4.454545454545454
5703842,5,B00C888NFQ,"A lot of the other reviews say that Inspector Morse fans will like this series. I had never heard of Inspector Morse, but this is fantastic. The mystery is interesting, not at all cliche, and the acting great, especially by the actor who plays Morse. His performance is subtle and endearing. He really draws you in. Here's hoping this is a long running series.",1393027200,,360,4.640625
5703843,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well acted, very high production values. The plots can sometimes be a little gothic, but the dialog is crisp and smart, and the actors do a terrific job.",1393027200,,153,4.5
5703844,5,B00C888NFQ,It is set in the early sixties and these actors really pull it off.  Not overly gritty like the currrent crime-dramas.  Somewhat reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes.  Det. Morse manages to see the importance in the small details.  Highly recommended.,1393027200,,245,5.205128205128205
5703845,5,B00C888NFQ,"I chose this show because I enjoy mysteries and particularly, British mysteries.  Endeavour did not disappoint!  Intellectually suspenseful!  I highly recommend if you enjoy mystery without the graphic violence so prevalent in American mysteries!",1393027200,,246,6.176470588235294
5703846,5,B00C888NFQ,Well written and acted. This series is carefully plotted and underplayed. It was a pleasure to watch the stories unfold instead of only anticipating the ending. My favorite new show!,1393027200,,182,5.1
5703847,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series is surprisingly good.  I think most prequels are less satisfying than the originals.  This series is an exception.  The plots are engaging, the acting excellent, and the story lines mesh nicely with the more mature Morse character.",1392940800,,243,5.17948717948718
5703848,5,B00C888NFQ,"Finished watching the pilot and season 1.  I could barely tear myself away from the program.  Love the quirky names given to the characters. Great writing and most of all the lead actor's performance is brilliant and so easy to care for and, yes, relate to in so many ways.  Highest recommendation for those who enjoy intelligent drama.",1392940800,,336,4.758620689655173
5703849,5,B00C888NFQ,I can hardly wait for the next installment of this program.  I loved everything about watdhing the mind of Endeavor work.  I also very much like his name.  And the best part is that he is Inspector Morse at a young age.  I saw the entire series of Inspector Morse and then Inspector Lewis before seeing Endeavor.  It was only because I caught the first name of Inspector Morse in one of the last 3 episodes that Endeavor caught my attention.  Otherwise I might have missed it altogether.,1392940800,,487,4.4772727272727275

5703861,4,B00C888NFQ,"This is another quality Masterpiece production.  I like these brainy-type mysteries.  It always leaves the viewer hanging until the solution is brought forth.  I also like the fact that the dialog does not become crude or insulting to the viewer and that the lead character seems to really have a heart.  I would give it a 5-star rating except for the difficulty I have with the accent of some characters, so I don't get the full effect of the story.  Otherwise, I will watch more of these.",1392940800,,490,4.586206896551724
5703862,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have enjoyed Inspector Lewis very much, but have sorely missed Inspector Morse. This is a terrific young Morse. I love not just his character, but the whole cast is terrific and the storyline great..... Fits right in with so much of the fabulous British TV.

ARE WE FAST BECOMING VOYEURS? ARE WE BEING MANIPULATED INTO AN ADDICTION WHICH GIVES SOMEONE THE BIG BUCKS? IS ANYONE GOING TO REGULATE THIS ISSUE AS THEY USED TO? EVEN THOUGH THE BODY SHOWN WAS DEAD, WAS IT REALLY HELPFUL TO THE PLOT TO SHOW THE BREAST?

5703885,5,B00C888NFQ,"Welcome to the younger version of Inspector Morse. We meet this character early in his career, as well as his mentor Fred Thursday, brilliantly portrayed by R. Allam. These mysteries follow a tried and true format, someone dies in the beginning, maybe a few more along the way, and the cops are in pursuit, trying to catch those responsible. It's not always a surprise who the bad guy is, but the path taken to the end is fun and interesting to watch. Production value, acting, and direction are all top notch, putting these cozy mysteries above the drivel seen on regular television. The little snippets of regular life, not just the pursuit of criminals, is also a nice touch because it seems very natural, as opposed to dropped in for character development. In other words, you become enveloped in these stories and go along for the entire ride. I hope they make more with the same cast and crew. Worth every penny on Amazon.",1392768000,,928,4.664634146341464

5703906,4,B00C888NFQ,"Great show really like the characters. The show is posted as the early life of Morse and the first few episodes of the season really build on that. The last episode of the season was clearly rushed and falls apart so don't watch that one first if at all.
They are going to need to really work at the struggles of Morse's career in the next season you could see them wanting to take the show back to being a Morse with younger characters when it should stick to its original idea of being the challenges of Morse becoming Morse.

Either way its a good watch.",1392681600,,557,4.254716981132075

The formula of the who dunnit is similar (and you have to keep a pencil and paper handy to keep track of people) but the times have changed. I like the earlier times, myself.

5703940,5,B00C888NFQ,"This 4 part tv series concerns the early career of Endeavour Morse, a young detective in the City of Oxford, England.  The time setting is 1965 with great costumes, clothes, cars, houses, music, institutions, roads, etc. to fit the time.  This showcases the very early career and beginnings of the young man, Endeavour Morse, that would continue with the TV show Inspector Morse series in his later life career.  The TV show Inspector Lewis spin-off series continues the stories and cases for the Inspector Morse type but with another character (Lewis) highlighted in that show.  This new series and the other two older series are all centered in Oxford.  In addition, there was a pilot movie made in 2012 before the 4 part episodes were made for a tv season.  All 5 of these episodes feature great acting and realistic cases and story lines.",1392422400,,842,4.8125

5703943,4,B00C888NFQ,"I like watching series like this, Downton Abby, Sherlock and the list goes on.  I never watched the original TV show so I didn't really know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this series is.  I hate to admit this, but I didn't realize right off that Endeavour was Morse's first name.  In any case, the episodes are tightly composed.  Unlike most American TV cop shows that move through time at breakneck speed; this series takes time to place the crime, clues and follow up in a methodical way.

Morse (Code) is such an awkward character who takes his time to work out some rather mundane clues to the obvious annoyance of his superiors and he cares more about getting it right than pleasing his bosses.  Even more interesting is the time period in which the series takes place - it is late 50s - early 60s.  The cars, clothes and attitudes of that time are spot on.  I read recently that Season II is set to begin shooting very soon so I will be looking forward to additional character development.  Even in the first season you can see how Morse grows more and more with each episode.  Glad it is coming back because there is so little worth watching on TV these days.",1392422400,,1197,4.420091324200913

5703966,5,B00C888NFQ,"Loved it, everthing rang true from the 60's.  A true who-done-it with a genius dodging a dope, very real life!  Well done can't wait for season 2.",1392249600,,146,4.37037037037037
5703967,4,B00C888NFQ,"If you like a good ""who done it"" like I do, these are worth watching. Especially when the kids have Cartoon Network on the TV.",1392249600,,126,4.08
5703968,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have been wondering it British television is just plain smarter, funnier, and more interesting.  My son postulates that the BBC as its share of ""Two Broke Girls,"" but that the process of selection limits our exposure.  In any case, this is a great series..It is a modern day Sherlock Holmes, likely with full intent, but in any case, it is interesting to watch.  I would recommend the series very much.",1392249600,,404,4.661971830985915
5703979,5,B00C888NFQ,"The prequel may be better than the main show. The choice of actor was quite appropriate and more likable than the elder, angrier Morse.",1392249600,,135,4.666666666666667
5703980,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well written, brilliantly acted, and one of the best filmed series I have ever seen.  It's only drawback is having to wait until Masterpiece shows the second season before it becomes available in the States. Maybe Amazon can help that along?  At any rate, I should have the first 5 episodes memorized by then.",1392249600,,309,4.703703703703703
5703981,5,B00C888NFQ,Great entertainment!!! Keeps you guessing until the very end. I love that all the characters are connected in some way.,1392163200,,119,5.0
5703982,4,B00C888NFQ,I have enjoyed several of these British programs. Endevour is unlike anything that can be found on US networks. It is delightful and thought provoking with very interesting characters and plots. I only wish we in the US could produce shows like this!!,1392163200,,251,4.8604651162790695
5703983,5,B00C888NFQ,"Very enjoyable. Whether you are a Morse fan hungry for more stories (set in an earlier time of his life) or just a lover of good detective stories, you should greatly enjoy this series.",1392163200,,185,4.470588235294118

5703985,5,B00C888NFQ,I am a huge fan of Inspector Lewis and was curious about this series. I have to say I have only watched a few Inspector Morse episodes so I wasn't sure what to expect. This series stands up on its own. Character development is well defined and I love the character of Inspector Thursday.,1392163200,,287,4.333333333333333

5703987,5,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour was a mystery to me when I first saw it. I had never heard of it before.  But I was pleasantly surprised and happily watched each episode along with my husband.  We were so disappointed when the season was over.  I hope you carry subsequent seasons for us to watch.  Good plot, good characters, good script!",1392163200,,317,4.508771929824562
5703988,5,B00C888NFQ,"Looking forward to season2.  Would like a little more context of the time period which is the 60's.  Like the main character - there is some mystery behind his past though that makes him a bit more distant that would like.  Also like his immediate boss, DI perfromed brilliantly by Roger Allum - but the DC over both of them seems a little over the top in terms of being an blankity blank.  Sorta like a Holmes but more practically based.  Also understand there is some series about an older Detective Morse.  Will need to find those as well.",1392163200,,542,4.424242424242424
5703989,5,B00C888NFQ,"Wonderful show, well acted and great cast where is season two please bbc, makes me miss home, beautfily filmed A plus",1392163200,,117,4.619047619047619

5703993,5,B00C888NFQ,"If you enjoyed the Inspector Morse series, you want to watch Endeavour.  An example of writers writing a good script and actors making the characters believable. The acting is outstanding, all the actors.  Especially enjoyed Roger Allam as the Detective Inspector mentoring young Morse.  Shaun Evans wears Morse well, great character development.  He makes you believe and silently cheer him on.",1392076800,,395,5.426229508196721

5703996,5,B00C888NFQ,Fantastic series with great acting and character development. It is a joy to see great acting and direction. Once again the BBC produces the best mystery series. Please produce more!,1392076800,,182,5.1

5703998,5,B00C888NFQ,I liked the older character and was doubtful that this would be a good addition.  It was well written and very good.,1392076800,,116,4.2727272727272725

5704011,5,B00C888NFQ,"I really enjoy the Endeavour series.  The only think that would make it better is if the none too ""bright"" commander Bright would be demoted or something for being such a jerk.",1391990400,,176,4.5
5704012,5,B00C888NFQ,"This is an excellent BBC mystery series. Inspector Morse in his early days, vintage sets from the 60's, most enjoyable entertainment!",1391990400,,133,5.380952380952381

5704015,5,B00C888NFQ,I have watched all of these episodes and the movie twice.  Endeavour is to the 1960s what Sherlock is to 2014(and Sherlock is the BFDeal!).  Rachel D'arcy is the artist/singer in Endeavour's last episode and she's downloadable on Amazon as well.,1391990400,,245,4.951219512195122
5704016,5,B00C888NFQ,"Loved Endeavor series like I loved Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis.  They are all good.

It is also nice to see the 1960s again.  Brings back memories.",1391990400,,155,4.666666666666667
5704017,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series does a great job of showing Morse's development from rookie to more seasoned officer. He starts out pretty clueless about interpersonal interactions, and the fact that there is no sudden change in that part of his personality rings true. He is who he is, and that's a man who is able to intuit how all the pieces fit together. He made have worked with codes and be good with crosswords, but Morse is somehow more than simply the sum of these parts. For fans of the older Morse, this is good introductory stuff. Enjoy!",1391990400,,529,4.520833333333333
5704018,5,B00C888NFQ,"Very well made depiction of the early years of Inspector Morse, made all the more interesting the producers depiction of the 1960s in England.",1391990400,,142,4.958333333333333

5704020,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series drug on a bit for my wife, but I loved it. Minimal use of guns, lots use of brains by the police, on the whole, plenty of murders to solve without a display of violence by the police in catching the murder. In the vein of Sherlock Holmes, with a lot of political pressure, and some political corruption mixed in with it. Loved it overall.",1391990400,,350,4.2388059701492535
5704021,5,B00C888NFQ,"This program was well done showing the brilliant insight Morse would consistently bring to the job.  I thought the young Morse was a little more sensitive to the feelings of others than the adult Morse of the earlier series.  It was a little sad to see the seeds of alcoholism planted early in one who had been a teetotaler.  Overall, I thought the program was well done, with thoroughly believable characters and will be appreciated by fans of the genre.",1391990400,,455,4.6625
5704022,4,B00C888NFQ,I really enjoy watching most everything BBC. This show is fun and serious at the same time I like the story.,1391990400,,108,4.190476190476191

5704025,5,B00C888NFQ,I am disappointed that there was only four episodes. This is one of the great programs I see on Amazon. I need more of these.,1391990400,,125,4.04
5704026,3,B00C888NFQ,While it is interesting it does not make you think about the next episode. I will stop giving ratings if you insist I do it only your way.,1391904000,,138,3.9642857142857144
5704027,5,B00C888NFQ,"i like this series very much. i watched season and was hooked right away. hope it continues for a lone time, can't wait for season two.

5704028,4,B00C888NFQ,"A very heady British mystery drama with several twists and ample character development.  It may appear slow moving at first, but it subtely pulls you into the story until you find yourself caught up in who really commited the crime.",1391904000,,232,4.8
5704029,5,B00C888NFQ,This is a great mind to watch and figure it all out! A must see for all PBS mystery officiators.,1391817600,,96,3.85
5704030,5,B00C888NFQ,Really good acting without the fancy sci-fi type investigating that you see on most American shows. If you enjoy old fashioned detective stories with solid acting this is a good bet,1391817600,,181,4.870967741935484

5704033,5,B00C888NFQ,"I loved the period details (early 60's) and the plot was complicated without being frustrating. Acting was superb, but, of course, it's British.",1391817600,,144,5.304347826086956

5704035,5,B00C888NFQ,"I was so surprised at the quality of ""Endeavor"" and at how seamlessly it ties in to the later Morse.
I'm looking forward to more seasons becoming available.",1391817600,,156,4.607142857142857
5704036,5,B00C888NFQ,"As usual, BBC pulls off another exquisite new period series. It revisits some of the same old themes: young misunderstood detective, and Sherlock-like, he's divinely gifted with the power of observation. Both the restraint showed by the characters (you gotta love how, having discovered the real murderer, the detectives saunter grimly, towards his or her house, the British never resort to running to heighten the suspense, not even in the television show MI-5) and the unusual brutality of the serial murders (yegods, nothing needs to be said here--it rivals anything on the American tube, except maybe Trueblood, for grisliness) demonstrates this is British television at it's best.

The usual suspects: great acting by young actors with luminous skin and older actors with the weight of talent + training + experience, convincing period costumes, scenery that can't be bought ... and three special extras: an incredible musical score, tremendous script writing, and the main character is a young version of the much beloved inspector Morse.

Not a step misplaced.",1391817600,,1067,5.345238095238095
5704037,5,B00C888NFQ,"well written and chief constable also excellent

very good prequel-I really enjoyed this series

endeavour himself is really the star",1391817600,,133,5.6
5704038,5,B00C888NFQ,I love the main character of Morse in this series. I do hate to see all the smoking (not the star tho) I have always liked the British shows but I can at least understand what he is saying and most of the others on the show. Fun to watch.,1391817600,,238,3.78
5704039,5,B00C888NFQ,"A great new series with great music.  It has the same excellent qualities of other Masterpiece Mysteries, not violent, not filled with wanton sex, not filled with foul and violent language...it is a pleasure to watch and listen to.",1391731200,,231,4.923076923076923
5704040,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have never seen the ""Inspector Morse""  series, so I approached ""Endeavour"" with no expectations at all and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the show. All the actors give nuanced performance with no hammering and the plot, although predictable at points is interesting enough to keep you engaged. I must say that I definitely am going to watch the next seasons.",1391731200,,372,4.904761904761905
5704041,5,B00C888NFQ,Absolutely terrific set of episodes!  Nicely atmospheric evocation of the period and wonderful plots which pull the viewer along.  The interactions amongst the various members of the police squad are very compelling.,1391731200,,216,5.71875
5704042,4,B00C888NFQ,Lead actors excellent. Stories and dialogue intelligent and entertaining. It is at least as good as the Morse series without John Thaw which I enjoyed.,1391731200,,151,5.08
5704043,5,B00C888NFQ,"These four programs were just fantastic, equal to all other Inspector Morse programs. Very well done, acted and prepared, just wish they were continued for other seasons.",1391731200,,170,5.333333333333333
5704044,5,B00C888NFQ,This exciting drama series was well done. As a retired police officer I thought Detective Morse and his senior supervisor were unique and realistic in their investigative roles. The story lines were real and believable. I highly recommend this show.,1391731200,,249,5.25
5704045,5,B00C888NFQ,"I found this series so pleasant although you must watch the first program that actually precedes the season and discusses the back story concerning Morse and his questions concerning detective work. Young Morse has a very questionable past; time spent at Oxford but no degree completed and time spent in the military. He reappears in Oxford and this is explained in the primary Endeavour. A fine series, four engaging intelligent shows built around themes such as ""Fugue"" and Morse's eccentric love of Opera. Characterization is well done; Detective Inspector Fred Thursday is the hard-boiled stylized cop who served in Africa during WW II. He even speaks German well with a scientist in ""Rocket"" which calls back his hatred of the Nazis. Female characters tend to be ""fluffy""; cute in the 1960's sense with flip hairdos and little strong sense under the hair or the stereotypical power mother in ""Rocket"" and the engaging dear sister in ""Fugue"".  Great murder stories, well done and worth watching twice to complete your understanding of the clues as they are added to the plot.",1391731200,,1079,5.027932960893855
5704046,4,B00C888NFQ,"Shaun Evans portrays Deputy Constable Morse as he begins his career in Oxford. His performance was excellent but Roger Allam as D.I Fred Thursday was exceptional. I also like the performance of Sean Rigby as Constable Strange and Anton Lessor in the role of Chief Superintendent Bright. Lovers of British Who-Done Its will thoroughly enjoy this series. The series had 6.5 million viewers in the UK and did well in the US with PBS. So I am hoping it will not become one of ITV's One Season wonders. The 1 episode ""The Girl"" Morse struggles with gaining acceptance and as DI Thursday say ""Learning Police work"". One aspect of British detective stories is the ""Body Count"" as the series  progresses they pile up. For a small English city the number of murders seems inordinately high. Enjoy and have a good time with this series.",1391644800,,826,4.736111111111111

5704060,4,B00C888NFQ,"With good 60's set and costume and many allusions back (really forward)  to the older Morse. I loved that one too, and occasion sly we get to see John Thaw again. I'll be glad when the mystery of the old girlfriend is fleshed out. And, of course, Fred Thursday is wonderful.",1391644800,,274,4.372549019607843

5704063,3,B00C888NFQ,I really enjoyed watching this series.  The very first episode was the best.  I was hoping for more seasons.  Somewhat predictable.,1391644800,,131,5.142857142857143
5704064,5,B00C888NFQ,i really enjoyed this series and many other shows like this offered originally by PBS. If your tired of the all the other action oriented shoot 'em ups or this so called reality nonsense all without any kind of plot that dominates television today then you might enjoy this too.,1391558400,,278,4.58

5704079,5,B00C888NFQ,"An interesting, dramatic and thought-provoking series.  The acting is very good and the stories have some meat to them.  The antithesis of the cookie-cutter Law and Order type police show.  I highly recommend it.",1391558400,,212,5.176470588235294

5704081,5,B00C888NFQ,"The writers take the older Morse into account in his obsession with music and crime. Shaun Evans is adorable (for some of us, nothing is as attractive as a clear mind that makes unlikely connections), and the tension between the superficial, unthinking bureaucracy and the dedication of Morse and Thursday adds to the interest.",1391558400,,327,5.074074074074074

5704083,5,B00C888NFQ,Wonderful British detective series.  This portrays Detective Inspector Morse when he was just starting out as a junior detective. The British always are spot on when it comes to period series and the writing and acting is excellent.  If your a fan of the British Detectives series then you will want to see this one too.,1391558400,,320,4.696428571428571
5704084,5,B00C888NFQ,This mystery series is well worth the watch being neither 'slap dash' nor widely unbelievable. It is relaxing and refreshingly intelligent rather than mindlessly sensational as is the way of many mystery/ crime series going.,1391558400,,224,5.428571428571429

5704087,4,B00C888NFQ,"This is a well-done, understatedly played BBC drama. If I truly liked mysteries/solving crime shows as a genre, I'd have rated it 5 stars. As it is, I love drama and good, intelligent stories with excellent acting - all of which Endeavor has. Good form!",1391558400,,253,4.644444444444445
5704088,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have a penchant for English mysteries.  I use the available subtitles to better understand the localisms (i.e., eejit) and the dialect that comes at me too quickly to process.  Subject matter is on the spot for me.

5704099,5,B00C888NFQ,"While it is true that I would have watched at least the first ten minutes of this series simply for it's (albeit indirect) connection to John Thaw's Morse (oh,don't we miss him so much !) I actually ended up watching the whole series within a few sittings and hankered for more. Everything about the production felt honest. I am frantic for more....",1391472000,,349,4.645161290322581
5704100,5,B00C888NFQ,"Absolutely loved the new morse! So many nuances, exc British mystery and production and numerous homage points to the old series for us sentimentalists :-) very well filmed, right degree of pedantic, taste of who he became.

5704102,3,B00C888NFQ,It seemed a little slow moving for my liking. One of the biggest reasons I stopped watching was due to the fact that I could only understand 1/2 of what they were saying. The accents were too strong for  my ears to discern.,1391472000,,223,4.186046511627907
5704103,2,B00C888NFQ,Especially the last episode. The way endeavor suddenly comes up with all the details and resolves the crimes is ludicrous and doesn't rest on ANY evidence presented to the inspector along the episode.,1391385600,2,200,5.090909090909091
5704104,5,B00C888NFQ,"If you like the writing, the themes, the relationships, and the mysteries of ""Morse"" & ""Lewis"" series, then you will be delighted with this pre-quell.

Another great product of British TV & film.",1391385600,,329,4.875

It is intriguing to follow the twists and turns in the plots and try to solve the crime as Morse encounters so many seemingly dead ends.

The series dates back to the 80's. I looked for similarities but could not find any. Will continue watching.,1391385600,,255,4.446808510638298
5704107,5,B00C888NFQ,After watching all the available Inspector Lewis seasons I was hungry for more from the Morse/Lewis saga.  I was pleasantly surprised by this Morse Prequel.  The quality is excellent with good writing and character development.  It was just the fix I needed.,1391385600,,258,5.095238095238095
5704108,5,B00C888NFQ,Excellent.  Great series showing the young Morse. (Actor Shaun Evans) and inspector Fred Thursday (Roger Allam). Can't wait for series two!,1391385600,,139,5.619047619047619

5704120,5,B00C888NFQ,"I am a big fan of British mysteries.  Endeavour, Inspector Morse, Foyle's War, etc. are all written exceptionally well.  To be able

5704125,5,B00C888NFQ,"I like this mystery show because it engages you to find the conclusion.  It has real people rather than super-heros; people who are believeable.  I also like the occasional music background that reflects Morse's background at Oxford.  A lot of current shows highlight exceptional action or witty sayings - things which have non depth.  Endeavour draws you into the plot so you can try solving it yourself, and often trying to understand what gives Morse the clues that he needs.  It is a very engaging and enjoyable time.",1391299200,,521,4.875

5704140,5,B00C888NFQ,Enjoyable show with well-written characters.  The depth of the story is driven by the life experience and personal circumstances of those involved not some contrived story to fit into a perfect box that is used for ratings.  Highly recommended.,1391299200,,244,5.230769230769231

5704161,5,B00C888NFQ,"They describe Detective Constable Morse as cerebral, which is fitting.  Shaun Evans is perfect for the part as Morse.  I have liked Roger Allum in everything to date.  He didn't disappoint me in his role as DI Thursday.  Together they make a good team, with (Allum) DI Thursday mentoring Constable Morse.  The plots are not predicable and Season One, in my humble opinion, was well written.  By that I mean that they even developed the characters well.  The added bonus for me is hearing phrases & words my grandparents use to say ""from the old country"", as they use to fondly refer to it.",1391212800,,589,4.605769230769231

It's set in the 1960's and the sets, clothing, cars, and references are so authentic to the period that I kept forgetting that it wasn't filmed then. The actor who plays Morse is handsome and his acting is spot on. I also really enjoyed the interactions between him and Thursday. I want more!",1391126400,,386,4.608695652173913

5704181,4,B00C888NFQ,"We purchased this because we are huge Inspector Morse fans and wanted this in our collection.  We had watched two of the episodes on Masterpiece and enjoyed them, so we decided to buy the DVD set.  It is probably best to have some knowledge of the original Inspector Morse series since that is the foundation on which this series is based.  The writers did a good job of making that connection back in time, which is key to the success of this series.  The English accents can sometimes be difficult to understand, which is why the DVD comes in handy ... to replay for clarity.  This is also true for some of the English idioms and colloquialisms that we in the US are unfamiliar.  This is a series made in England, primarily for the English audience, so these should be considered  minor criticisms.",1391126400,,800,4.5524475524475525

5704183,5,B00C888NFQ,"Love and adore this series for the actors and the characters; they have tremendous depth.  Although I really like the stories too I think some of the solutions and the detective work are a bit weak but this is easily transcended by the simple fact that the two main characters are my favorite at the moment in all of current tv land. Cannot wait for season 2.

Having said this it is quite humorous to think of oxford as the murder capital of Europe.

Great period sense and mood, this latter ably aided by use of opera and other classical music.",1391040000,,546,4.3861386138613865

5704185,5,B00C888NFQ,"I recommend this series for mystery fans.  The Oxford In the 1960s setting is well filmed, the characters are deep and interesting, and the mysteries are written well enough to not be obvious at first glance.

Yet, he usually got it wrong his first few attempts.  The young Morse has that same melancholy, slightly out-of-sync feel as the old Inspector.  I'm still waiting to find out why he seems like a man who has lost so much in life.  Very well done.  I look forward to watching the rest of the series.

5704256,5,B00C888NFQ,Very well written and acted.  To the point of being outstanding and very interesting!  I cannot understand why only 1 season and 4 episodes!  I could watch this exceptional series forever!  Highly recommended.,1390867200,,209,5.242424242424242
5704257,5,B00C888NFQ,"Great show!!  For one episode, the video continued to stop as we watched through the app on our TV.  There was a message about low bandwidth.  Other than this the show itself is a keeper.",1390867200,,187,4.285714285714286
5704258,5,B00C888NFQ,BBC mysteries always the best....and Endeavor is one of the best on television...thanks so much for having the series on PRIME....,1390867200,,130,5.238095238095238

5704270,5,B00C888NFQ,"I'm a sucker for British mysteries. This is a good one. Young Morse has a perfect face for the roll. I like everything about it. Long, slow thoughtful stories about people being people. I like his ethics and the problems he comes up against. If you pay attention shows like this can help you solve your own problems. This is right up there with Foyle's War in my book.",1390867200,,368,4.3478260869565215
5704271,5,B00C888NFQ,The mysteries are superbly written and there  is never an uninteresting moment.  The acting is excellent and the ambiance of each episode is visually captivating.  I was skipping around Amazon's video site and decided to try watching something new to me.  I am so glad I did.  That series led me to the Inspector Lewis series which I am enjoying immensely.,1390867200,,356,4.770491803278689
5704272,5,B00C888NFQ,Enjoyed Inspector Lewis so I though I would give it a try.  I really enjoyed it.  Masterpiece always does such a great job.  I can't wait for another season.  I hope there will be one.,1390867200,,184,4.171428571428572

5704274,5,B00C888NFQ,"The main character Morse was extremely interesting. The satellite characters were fantastic and had depth, and I Loved the backdrop of the 60's.  The 3 episodes I watched really just pulled me in. I hope to see more seasons of this series.",1390867200,,239,4.690476190476191
5704275,4,B00C888NFQ,"Anyone who loves Morse will appreciate this look at the detective in his early years. It's easy to develop empathy for the brilliant, troubled young man who became the brilliant, troubled older detective. Loved this series!",1390867200,,223,5.222222222222222
5704276,4,B00C888NFQ,They used some clever twists and turns in the story line.  It was interesting to watch the inspector work through the situations.  Loved to see the surroundings.  I would recommend this series.,1390867200,,193,4.96875

5704302,5,B00C888NFQ,"This show is when Morse is only a constable before he makes the rank of Inspector and of course he gets into trouble, is told not to pursue a case, does so anyway and ends up solving it.  These BBC shows are really good.",1390867200,,220,4.0

5704304,5,B00C888NFQ,"A great new series! Clever, well written, acted and produced. I thought they had  pretty well exhausted the Morse franchise with Lewis, but here they come again.

5704306,5,B00C888NFQ,"We bought this out of curiosity, because we liked the Inspector Morse series.  We enjoyed it every bit as much because it explains some of Morse's idiosyncratic behaviors.  Good story lines, good acting, the murders were not too gory or overdone.",1390694400,,246,4.975609756097561

5704309,5,B00C888NFQ,"What can I say.....this series is fantastic. Great stories; great mysteries.  Shaun Evans is very believable as a young Inspector Morse. Mr. Evans is a fine actor and the interaction between he and Roger Allam as DI Thursday is wonderful to watch. I look forward to more of Shaun Evans' work, especially as Detective Constable Endeavor. I highly recommend the Endeavor mysteries to anyone who enjoys good mysteries.",1390608000,,415,5.102941176470588
5704310,5,B00C888NFQ,What a great series. I wish it didn't go so fast. Shaun Evans is fantastic as the lead character. You simply root for him to solve the case and each episode has a great twist that keeps you on your toes. Can't wait or he next one to come out. Hurry up producers. This is a hit.,1390521600,,277,3.8771929824561404

5704312,5,B00C888NFQ,"I really cannot say enough good things about this series. It seems hard to believe that the particular genius that was John Thaw portraying Inspector Morse could be any better, but the focus and attention of Shaun Evans as the young constable-Endeavour, is a revelation. Such complex and interesting inner stories...LOVE Colin Dexter for creating Morse and love this young actor and the writers for giving us added background on this remarkable entry in the Masterpiece Canon. Bravo!",1390521600,,483,5.205128205128205

5704314,4,B00C888NFQ,The young Morse is cerebral but humane and likeable. I love seeing this prequel  imagining  how Inspector Morse became his older better-known self.,1390435200,,147,5.3478260869565215
5704315,5,B00C888NFQ,It is not Morse but it captures the same type of detail and twists and turns. Endevour should complete transistion to DCI.,1390435200,,122,4.590909090909091
5704316,5,B00C888NFQ,"Hope we get more ""seasons"" - beautifully acted - well scripted - makes a wonderful addition to the Masterpiece offerings...and thank goodness for Masterpiece who we can count on for thoroughly good drama and entertainment.",1390435200,,222,5.371428571428571
5704317,5,B00C888NFQ,Great series. I loved it. The acting is good. The direction is such that it builds up the suspence until the very end. I recommend watching it. Its too bad that there are only 4 episodes and one season.,1390435200,,202,4.205128205128205
5704318,5,B00C888NFQ,"'Endeavour' follows the career of a young Detective Constable whom we would later grow to respect and love as Inspector Morse. These dramas establish a similar pattern and production style to those we saw in 'Morse' - long episodes that allow for a steady plot pace, beautiful cinematography (and of course a lush orchestral soundtrack), fascinatingly human characters with plenty of subtext, and a quiet, very 'British' approach to drama that nevertheless seeks to engage with both the full spectrum of human nature and the socio-cultural concerns of a rapidly changing age.

It's interesting to see the people and circumstances that helped to shape Morse's approach to life and his career, although of course his essential characteristics (his love of music and puzzles, his fascination with women, his stubborn devotion to justice, and the grumpy refusal to play politics which will get in the way of career advancement) are already apparent. The show is anchored by Morse's relationship with his mentor Det. Insp. Thursday, and we see a young man grounded and a mature man refreshed as they learn to rely on each other's strengths, and value one another's insights. The interaction between these two front-liners and a host of characters that typify the tensions of 1960s England make this one to watch.",1390435200,,1307,5.136150234741784
5704339,5,B00C888NFQ,It is a great depiction of what Moss would've been like beginning his career in police work. I highly recommend it.,1390435200,,115,4.523809523809524
5704340,5,B00C888NFQ,"Hoping for more episodes, my husband and I enjoyed the first season. When can we except more shows like this?",1390435200,,109,4.5
5704341,5,B00C888NFQ,"We're back in familiar territory with a young Morse in a 1960s Oxford. We meet a young Constable Strange, and Morse's mentor, Fred Thursday - and we learn the genesis of many later Morse quirks. The mysteries are intriguing, and writing is good, and the acting is superb. And it's just nice to feel like you're back among friends.",1390435200,,330,4.610169491525424
5704342,5,B00C888NFQ,"Simply put, Endeavour is superior - a real joy to watch.  Evans has developed into a skillful actor while Allam and Lesser are superior.  The writing and storyline are thoughtful, sharp and intriguing and have captured the feel of the time.  The visuals are a real pleasure - helped by the Oxford locale.  The music goes without saying - always enjoyable.  I only wish we could have more than four episodes per season of this gem.  However, it surely take takes time and much effort to produce a series of this caliber.  This series is the best that television has to offer.",1390435200,,574,4.568627450980392
5704343,5,B00C888NFQ,This series will hook you from the very start.  It is one of the shows that is definitely worth your time.,1390348800,,106,4.0476190476190474
5704344,5,B00C888NFQ,"I really enjoyed watching the young Detective Constable Morse as we see the foundations of the man who is to become Inspector Morse.  In this series we see some of the beginnings of the traits we see in the later years.  He's a very intelligent introvert, who thinks differently from most of the people around him and so finds himself definitely the ""odd man out"".  But his talent as a detective is recognized by his immediate superior who supports and encourages his lateral thinking.  Those who like the Inspector Morse series should like this one.",1390348800,,550,4.757894736842105

5704346,5,B00C888NFQ,Morse and Lewis is a great mystery team based in England.  This series is no longer available in the Buffalo NY area PBS.  This is a series about Morse before Lewis.,1390348800,,165,4.290322580645161

5704348,4,B00C888NFQ,"We would like to see more of this series.  It is especially nice, the way they have shown us ""Morse"" from time to time, and answered some of the questions about his life that the ""Morse"" series deliberately left ambiguous.  The actor playing Endeavour does a really good job and does not appear overwhelmed by the task of being ""Morse"" in his younger years.  Good show!",1390262400,,369,4.5606060606060606
5704349,5,B00C888NFQ,"I will miss him... Really, a very good movies, fantastic atmosphere of 60s (I suppose), and English climates:)

5704353,5,B00C888NFQ,"A quite enjoyable show with witty British dialogue, great character development, and unexpected twists.  I never heard anyone mention this show before and I am glad that I happened to stumble upon it.  I'm looking forward to the next season.

Also,  there is a prequel to this series ""Masterpiece Mystery Endeavour (2012)"" which explains how Mose ended up back in Oxford.

5704354,4,B00C888NFQ,If you are Morse fan then Endeavour will probably help fill the hole left by the loss of John Thaw as Inspector Morse.  It will help but it will never quite be the same.,1390262400,,169,3.9705882352941178
5704355,4,B00C888NFQ,"I enjoyed this series. I like the old English scenery and the crimes were intricate enough to keep me watching. The acting was very good, even though the key character never seems to smile or enjoy anything!",1390262400,,207,4.621621621621622
5704356,5,B00C888NFQ,This is a show for people who really enjoy mystery and the process of solving a puzzle.  This is not a show for those looking for  fast action.,1390262400,,143,4.071428571428571
5704357,5,B00C888NFQ,This is a great series. It is in the awesome style of Inspector Morse and even more like Inspector Lewis. Very well written and will keep you guessing.,1390262400,,151,4.428571428571429
5704358,5,B00C888NFQ,Endeavor is a good story line and gives background to the early years of Inspector Morris. I like the sixties era as well.,1390176000,,122,4.3478260869565215

5704374,5,B00C888NFQ,"I only know Inspector Morse through the television programs. I have watched them all - many more than once - over the years.  I was pleased with the pilot for Endeavour and then certainly enjoyed the four episodes of season one.  I viewed them when they first appeared on PBS and then have viewed them subsequently as they've become available on PBS online and through Amazon Prime Instant Video.  I see that originally they needed to be purchased and as time has gone by they are now a part of Amazon Prime. They also recently appeared on Netflix.  All this is to be expected.  However, in terms of the programs themselves - excellent - and wonderful hints of the original television programs.",1390176000,,694,4.655737704918033

5704379,4,B00C888NFQ,"Fine casting and very sharp writing make this series both compelling and engaging as the mysteries often become less important than the characters. Young Morse is complex and drivien by his keen mind and the ghosts that already plague him and the supporting characters go beyond stereotype more often than not. Best of all isthe intelligent and knowing use of music from all genres, totally era appropriate and complementary to the setting, the mood and the meaning of each episode.",1390176000,,482,5.0375

5704418,5,B00C888NFQ,"I had heard of Inspector Morse, because I watch the Inspector Lewis series. I ran into Endeavour by accident and decided to give it a try. It is wonderful. Can't wait for series two to come out.

In case you are confused, let me give a bit of background. There was an Inspector Morse series that ran from the late 80's to the 90's more or less - Lewis was Morse's assistant in that series. Then the Inspector Lewis series followed, and I think it is still active - another great series. I watched the first episode of Inspector Morse last night, and liked it, though it seems a but dated now - in that series, Morse is a middle aged detective. In Endeavour - that's Morse's first name - Morse is a young detective in 1960's.

All three programs are set in Oxford, England, and the university is somehow part of the story in each episode - at least in all the ones I've seen. Lots of murder and mayhem going on in and about the great university.

Morse is on the cerebral side, but he works with more practical people all the time. They each have a contribution to make. It is interesting to watch them mesh together and get the cases solved. In Lewis, the assistant is the cerebral guy.

Morse's immediate boss in Endeavour is named Thursday - he is a great character. Thursday respects Morse's intellect, but he has to work hard sometimes bringing Morse along in the real world of crime investigation. Strange is a uniform cop who plays an important role as well - it can be a little comical when he and Morse work together given how different they are, but they get along well.

Thursday's boss, named Bright, seems anything but bright most of the time. An officious little jerk is more like it. It can be funny to watch Thursday deal with Bright.

The plots are complex, but not overly so. Violence is there, but not overdone as in many American programs. The settings are great. Lots of opera and classical music and high brow references - but some low brow thrown in for balance now and then.

This is British crime drama at its best. Highly recommended.",1390003200,,2059,4.431216931216931
5704439,4,B00C888NFQ,"I love seeing a younger Morse how he came to be the stodgy older man. There is a line in one of the movies, the lady says Morse is all corners, awkward. I thought what a good way to describe him. He is not like other men, he is different and shy sometimes, not a ladies man at all. He is very smart, even though he doesn't always say and do what others would deem appropriate or proper. A series worth seeing...",1390003200,,411,4.024390243902439
5704440,5,B00C888NFQ,"I liked the pre-Morse series better than the Inspecter Morse or Lewis series both of which can be a little dry and dark.

5704447,4,B00C888NFQ,"Since I like Morse and Lewis, this was easy to watch and enjoy.  A young DI Morse with all of his lack of tact and sophistication without the clout of tenure that allows him to get away with presenting his perspective and raw crime solving talent.  He even has to endure a chief that disrespects his skills.  Thankfully, his immediate supervisor sees and acknowledges his value to the crime solving team.

5704451,5,B00C888NFQ,"I have enjoyed these Endeavour videos (prequels to the Morse videos) very much.  After watching Morse, you can
see the personality traits in the younger man which come to be the traits of Morse.  As an example, the younger
Morse (Endeavour), has the same penchant for falling for the woman who has committed the crime as the older Morse so often does.  He is also an opera fan, reads voraciously, and does crosswords.  I particularly liked the ending of  'Girl' which
envisions him as a detective so many years later.  His social awkwardness and vulnerability are a nice touch but neither
ever keeps him from standing up for what he thinks is right, he may be silent in the face of opposition, but he does not flinch.

5704455,5,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour is Inspector Morse's given name which he never uses as he ages, so this series of Coonstable Endeavour Morse anticipates some of Inspector Morse's quirks.

Some of the secondary characters could probably stand to be fleshed out a little more but that is a lot to ask in the first season of a show. The story was good, the acting was good, and the portrayal of the time frame was well done. There are even multiple scenes where the slight smokey haze that exists in any indoor location with a lot of smoking is shown. This is one of the few times I have posted a review and the fact that I took the time to do it is a pretty good indication of how much I enjoyed the show.",1389830400,,654,4.077519379844961

And, as Morse is a cruciverbalist, you get to look for clues embedded in the shows. For example: ""Rocket."" It concerns the Broom family, arms makers, and their squabbling. It mirrors the family of Henry II (first Plantagenet king of England) almost to the letter. The husband, Henry Broom (Plantagenet is another word for Broom Straw) and his live-apart wife Nora (Eleanora of Aquitaine) and their three nasty children (Richard, John, and a sister, Estella, to take the place of Geoffrey). And, of course, their late eldest sibling, Henry, called Harry, who had been expected to take over the realm (factory). Add in Alice Vexin (Alais in Henry II's latest squeeze in ""Lion in Winter,"" and the Vexin was rich, fertile agricultural land Henry and Eleanor quarreled over.) and you've got almost the whole thing.

5704527,4,B00C888NFQ,"I saw Shaun Evans (II) in The Boys and Girl From County Clare and loved him. He is equally good in this. He pulls off the intelligent, driven character well. With the possibility of Inspector Lewis, and Sherlock being no more, I am really glad to have something good to look forward to. I hope I fall in love with this character like the others mentioned. PBS Masterpiece really puts put some amazing programs.",1389484800,,410,4.554054054054054

5704548,4,B00C888NFQ,Plots are intelligent and suspensful.  Show to show they come across as a little formulaic but a very entertaining detective show.,1389398400,,130,5.190476190476191
5704549,5,B00C888NFQ,This young man has far to go ---but I do not doubt his success. He is patient and charming and Likes Classical music.  A great start.,1389398400,,133,4.115384615384615
5704550,5,B00C888NFQ,"I happen to have been (and still am) a huge fan of the original series ""Morse""...always loved the originals acerbic character and his love of crosswords, opera, etc. - the thinking man or woman's detective - so to get to see this new series showing how he became the detective in later life is great.  Well done...hope to see many more.",1389398400,,336,4.508196721311475

5704556,5,B00C888NFQ,This was an intelligently done crime series as are most Masterpiece.  NOT romantic and stupid.  I don't want to know about the detectives personal lives.  I want to know about the crime and how they solved it.  This show does just that.  Good characters and plots. I loved it.,1389398400,,276,4.551020408163265
5704557,4,B00C888NFQ,"Good storyline and acting is superb.  I can't wait for the next season to be released, I also wished that there were more than 4 episodes",1389398400,,137,4.269230769230769

I hope we get to see more of this Morse!!!",1389312000,,234,4.4186046511627906
5704570,5,B00C888NFQ,"This is, if anything, more fun than the original Inspector Morse.  Period details are pitch perfect, and the young man playing Morse gives his portrayal just the right blend of awkwardness and shrewdness to make him believable.  The Oxford locale provides a good backdrop for the rookie constable just beginning to find his legs as an ace detective.",1389312000,,349,5.0
5704571,5,B00C888NFQ,Really enjoyed this drama series.  Definitely would love to see more episodes. I enjoy this prequel series more than original.,1389312000,,126,5.3

5704578,5,B00C888NFQ,Good stories- lots of details gradually tied together. Keeps you watching closely. Time flies.  Hints slowly develop each character explaining why they are like they are.,1389225600,,170,5.538461538461538
5704579,4,B00C888NFQ,Love Endeavour...it is easy to see how he progressed into the older Morse.  Brilliantly written and played to perfection by Shaun Evans.,1389225600,,136,5.181818181818182
5704580,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well if you liked old Morse, it would seem reasonable to wonder what interpretation the writers could do with him as a young detective. Interesting plot development, amusing from my perspective for set layout and design ( setting is Oxford circa 196X ), is very evocative of the time time period and some of the scenic and room design is very painterly in landscape and still photography vein.

Acting quality is good ( the english seem to have a very good infrastructure for developing talent and using all ages, while here in 'Merica we seem to fix on young, glossy and/or anorexic, Brits do display twits, they seem to represent different percentage than my home grown production companies use, just say'n ).

Recommend if you like often dry english humor, resentful, repressed class ( several class types available, no waiting ) displays and whole lot of smoking, which is now is not depicted much in contemporary TV culture.",1389225600,,929,4.8734177215189876

5704582,5,B00C888NFQ,"Sticking true to the original Inspector Morse series, this prequel is just as detailed in it's mysteries as the original.

I haven't yet watched the 4th Episode of season 1, and part of me wants to delay doing so... I don't want to have to wait so terribly long for further episodes! Unfortunately, I will not be able to help myself and will certainly watch episode four as soon as I complete this review. Ahh, such is the temptation of Endeavour!",1389052800,,578,4.514285714285714

5704644,3,B00C888NFQ,"The reason I give only 3 stars is because I had technical problems watching it.  The audio was poor, especially when ""Endeavor"" was speaking.  The captions worked sometimes, but sometimes didn't.  I finally gave up watching without knowing whether it was lack of quality of the film, with the transmission in streaming, or?  Since I have a trial Prime membership I've been watching only the ""Prime"" free movies, and it has been my experience with several films.  I have a large-screen, iMac and don't have the same issues with my other subscription for streaming movies.  My trial with Prime is almost over, and I regret I may not subscribe for the year due to these problems.

5704646,5,B00C888NFQ,"Hats off to those responsible for casting Endeavor!  Shaun Evans and Roger Allam were the perfect choices.  After the pilot, I was hocked and was a bit disappointed there only 4 more to watch, but very happy that a 2nd series is on the way. Endeavor does not give up.  Even though his mind works beyond the norm, he has a lot to learn and who else to guide him, but his senior officer, Thursday. When Thursday asks Morse, ""Where do you want to be in 20 years?"", Morse looks in the rear view mirror and they show the face of Thaw - great connection to the the series Inspector Morse.

Endeavor is grabbing.  Like with George Gently, it presents the 60s through the filters of
moral ambiguity in a way never contemplated, much less dared, 50 years ago.  Besides, the
photographic quality is A-1.  If Inspector Lewis, also outstanding, is coming to an end (judging
by the vibes coming out of the last episode in Series 6), it is necessary that Endeavor plays
on.",1382313600,,471,4.924050632911392

5704755,5,B00C888NFQ,"The fact that hundreds of viewers rank ""Endeavor"" at the highest level (via Amazon) only hints at the quality of ""Endeavor."" As a devoted fan of ""Inspector Morse"" and ""Lewis"" I can assure you that ""Endeavor"" is worthy of your time. Currently running (advancing to the second season) ""Endeavor"" reveals Morse's early days as a compassionate ""copper"" fresh out of the signal corps (deciphering covert code ~ beyond morse, ironically) during WWII.  This thought-provoking show (set in the 1960's) features character-driven writing, amazing plots and vivid art direction. It also flashes back to that threshold era when the ""hard boiled copper days"" began to subside under the emergence of sophisticated DNA tracking and psychological profiling. Sean Evans as young Morse breaks your heart with his soulful performance. Roger Allam is riveting as his fatherly, caring mentor DI Fred Thursday (the solid man we learned about in Colin Dexter's novels). You may remember Allam in 1997 as the ambitious academic Denis Cornford in ""Death is Now My Neighbour"" from the ""Inspector Morse"" series. Two ""Endeavor"" episodes, for me, stand out: ""Fugue"" and ""Home."" In ""Fugue"" Morse's passion for opera helps him decode a serial killer's taunting puzzles. A touching scene between Morse and Thursday underscores why, years later, DCI Morse stayed true to the beauty of classical music and opera. We understand just how much young Morse needed the tender embrace of a loving family. ""Home"" takes us back to Morse's roots where we see into the hungry heart of a young man yearning for fatherly understanding and guidance. This episode is rich with gangsters, Playboy era nightclub atmospheres and dark alley politics blurring the line between criminals and coppers. DI Thursday's haunting past and the lengths a father will go to protect his family contrast with Morse's stark boyhood. We also see how the friendship developed between young Morse and beat cop Strange. Strange would later become Morse's blustery boss. A ""superior"" who, although seemingly filled with scold and scoff, deeply respected Morse's mind and would eventually mourn his death like no other (aside from Lewis).  ""Endeavor"" grabs us by the heart and throat, only to stay embedded within our own psyches long after the credits roll.",1381708800,,2286,5.226158038147139

That a successful sequel series could be made based on the Inspector Lewis character was itself pretty amazing, but what has been done in prequel -- ""Endeavour"" -- is nothing short of astounding. I find myself memorized.

The series will stand on its own, but to a Morse fan the little hints of the man's character and how it forms is entrancing.

Well conceived, well written, well acted and beautifully filmed. Seen on a large screen in Blu-Ray format it is like visiting Oxford with old friends.

5704782,5,B00C888NFQ,Endeavour is another great English mystery series full of surprises. The acting is superb; the period background well done. It is as good as the Marple series or Sherlock. Not sorry I bought it.,1380844800,2,194,4.735294117647059

5704785,5,B00C888NFQ,Obviously the same production team as  the Lewis series which we also liked very much.  Understanding the young Morse will enhance rewatching the original morse.,1380672000,,161,5.4
5704786,4,B00C888NFQ,The program has a quality circa 1965 feel.  Morse could do with a change of suit to make him fit better with his later dressing style.  It seems to me the script writers must be paid a large sum for each word on a low budget project.  In other words an expanded dialog would improve the story.  I liked the series and look forward to next season.,1380672000,,346,4.119402985074627

Imagine my utter delight to discover Shaun Evans' wonderful performance as the young Endeavour Morse. It almost pains me to admit it, but -dash it- Mr. Evans' Morse may be the best. Add terrific storylines and Roger Allam's performance as Morse's mentor, DI Thursday, and ""Endeavour"" comes across as top-notch entertainment.

Lots of little scenes that tell you interesting things about Morse's background (like how/why Strange became Morse's boss, and that  it began as an act of kindness on Morse's part)
Shaun Evans is simply brilliant in this - showing Morse's emotions a bit more, but also laying the groundwork for all his idiosyncrasies later in his career, and Roger Allam is wonderful as his mentor, DI Thursday
All in all, it's an excellent series and I hope it will go on for many, many series.",1380153600,,609,4.577981651376147

It's been so much fun to see the experiences of the young Morse that explain his many unique characteristics from the original series.

The brilliance of the notion of not just starting with Endevour Morse alone but in placing Morse in history along with all the other characters that we've come to know over the years in what now become the ""ensuing series"" of Inspector Morse is only to be marveled at.  Further, the writers have made the viewer ""dig"" for recognition of some of the characters while others are immediately obvious.  Add to that the creation of Inspector Thursday as a principled former London Inspector with personal regrets as Morse's mentor, and the fat's in the fire.

This pilot/4-episode series set in the 60s as a ""prequel"" to the Inspector Morse (IM) series is the best. I'm not a fan of the IM series, but this is tremendous. Shaun Evans as the young Morse is a fantastic actor to watch. Each episode is like a mini film with really good writing and direction. Much better than anything else out there. PBS did not air the pilot in the US, so it's an added bonus for us.",1379808000,,488,4.315217391304348

5704813,5,B00C888NFQ,Shaun Evans is a surprise and a pleasing one at that as he out thinks the ranking detectives but his immediate superior DI Thursday (Roger Allam) recognizes young Morse powers of deduction and insinuates Endeavor into cases that rise the ire of the older men.  The tension between higher ranking detectives and Endeavor is played just right. I also like the pure detecting as there is none of the advanced forensics to get in the way. We await with bated breath the release of series 2.,1379548800,,486,4.651162790697675

I didn't quite know what this DVD was going to be about, but since I adore British detective series, we bought it.

Wish the ""Endeavour"" series was continued.",1379376000,,363,5.101694915254237
5704817,5,B00C888NFQ,"Excellent acting, especially by the young Morse's mentor.  The young Morse is shown as a Detective Constable who can ""think outside the box"" and somewhat resented by some of his colleagues and superiors alike.  However, what is true is that he solves complicated murders which makes even his critics shine.  We begin to see how Morse's love of opera, Oxford education, love of certain cars, crossword puzzles and dogged determination to worry away at a problem allow him to solve complicated murders.  That the young, as the older, Morse is lonely is shown by his interactions with his dying father and his awkward attempts at love.  Morse tends to put women on a pedestal and worship them and their talent; his romantic devotion seems misplaced.  He see the glimmerings of his loyalty to his mentor but Morse is becoming a lonely man with opera recordings and a growing alcohol problem.  But, he is dogged and determined in solving murders.",1379289600,,941,4.880503144654088

5704830,5,B00C888NFQ,"Well written. As a huge fan of Morse I found his early years very interesting. It showed Morse as a young man and with the same characteristics.

This show, it seems, shows Morse as a ""baby detective"" who did his job in spite of obstacles placed in his way.  The ingenious use of characters, recognizable to Morse fans, expressions which also tie to the Morse series, is like a welcome teasing from John Thaw himself.  I think I even saw a cameo by Dexter in one of the Endeavour episodes. Ah, it brings good memories, in addition to being a quality show.

While Inspector Morse has not reached that hallowed level yet, he is proving to be a formidable candidate. Rarely do we encounter a perfect storm of cerebral, emotional, human, and creative elements in great plots, conflicts, and - above all - characters as we do in the Morse and Lewis series. Endeavor is as brilliantly conceived, written, directed, cast, and acted as any of the best dramas out there!  While the idea of setting the drama in Morse's early career is brilliant and intriguing enough, the quality and depth of the plots and performances takes it over the top.

5704886,5,B00C888NFQ,"This DVD version of the early years of the character who became Inspector Morse is most interesting to watch. It is extremely well-acted, the scripts are equally well written and keep the younger version of Morse in-character--including his combination of gallantry and naive romanticism towards women--and also give the viewer some background as to his early life, familial situation, and why he became the man that he did. It doesn't hurt that the actor playing the young Morse, Shaun Evans, is highly attractive. His superior and mentor on the police force, D.I. Thursday, is played by the fine British actor Roger Allam. The mysteries themselves are also quite intriguing and would be of interest to any fan of mysteries, even those who are not familiar with Morse. This is a 3-Disc set, the full UK-length edition, including the pilot episode. Morse fans will want to buy it so that they can watch it as often as they wish, and even if you are not yet a Morse fan, it is well worth buying and watching with the whole family around it, seeing who can guess who the murderer is. Since it is on DVD, you can stop it at any time to pass the popcorn and argue about it! It is definitely a season and a series that is worth buying and keeping.",1378425600,,1242,4.573991031390134

5704929,4,B00C888NFQ,"The genius of the Inspector Morse novels by Colin Dexter (and the famous TV series based on them) resided in two things. Forst, Oxford, with its dreaming spires, academic intrigues, enormous social mix and industrial developments, makes the perfect site for English murder mysteries. The other was the person of Inspector Endeavour Morse: intuitive, obsessive in his persnickety love of the finer things (opera, crossword puzzles, fancy cars), squeamish about blood, quick to fall for matters of the heart and even quicker to be bruised in them. The wonderfully charismatic John Thaw so perfectly realized the character on TV that when he died, Dexter killed off the character; eager to recapture his magic, British television tried to revive the series's original success by starring Morse's less intellectual and cultured compatriot, Sergeant Lewis, in his own mystery series--which succeeded so far as you could stand Sergeant Lewis. Here they try again with ""Endeavour,"" a series to appeal not just to fans of the oxford setting but of the Inspector Morse character himself, by starting at the beginning of his career in the mid-Sixties long before he met Lewis.

Shaun Evans almost uncannily seems to connect with Thaw's later portrayal of Endeavour Morse: he has all the hesitations, the kindnesses, and the singular tastes, but none of the physical self-confidence Morse might have achieved in later years. In the final episode, ""Home,"" when Morse must interact with his dying, disappointed father, you get a sense of how truly fantastic Evans really is as an actor, The mid Sixties Oxford setting is terrifically and realistically realized here : very few of the women are in Mad Men bouffants but are in frumpier and more believable hairstyles that perfectly evoke the realities of the era. The mysteries are exceptionally difficult to solve (although always fairly laid out for the viewer beforehand). The only real drawback of the series is the strange variability of the plots: one of the stories, ""Fugue,"" seems more like Thomas Harris than Colin Dexter, and involves a ridiculously unlikely serial killer who spectacularly murders his victims according to the endings of operas. The much superior episodes include the pilot (involving a retired diva Morse adores); ""Rocket,"" a very Dexterish story involving Princess Margaret's visit to a munitions factory owned by a hateful wealthy family; and ""Home,"" which mixes mob involvement with local town-gown politics.",1377907200,2,2476,5.284263959390863

I guess they weren't ever originally shot by BBC?  Is that right?  Would be curious to know.
It's my understanding that there were some early dvd products that were the edited cuts.  The PBS versions shown here is US were the real deal.  It's BBC AMERICA cuts that are  disappointing.

5704952,5,B00C888NFQ,"This was my first introduction to the world of Colin Dexter but that did not inhibit my enjoyment of the series in the least.

 Endeavour is written in such a way that it will please fans both old and new. The old will enjoy seeing the portrayals of these younger versions as well as all the beginnings and references to the Morse who first appeared in ""Last Seen Wearing.""

  The new (like myself) will be introduced to quirky, brilliant characters and led through fascinating mysteries. We will also end up loving it so much we will immediately start trying to track down all other incarnations of the characters--the original Inspector Morse in both print and screen as well as Inspector Lewis (I'm sure it's not just me who did that).

Finally, both new and old fans alike will love the quality of the production as well as the actors. The writing is intelligent, entertaining, and dolloped with just a bit of humour. The mysteries keep you guessing and give your brain a work-out. The scenes are authentic and the costumes are great. The best part though, is the acting. Shaun Evans as Endeavour is slightly awkward, could care less about convention, and is completely believable as the opera-loving genius of a man. He is also very human, which makes the character lovable and makes you sympathetic to how his unique brain makes him a misfit in the eyes of others. Roger Allam as DI Thursday, in a way, plays the same part as Lewis in the original. He brings out the best in Morse and reminds him (and us) that he does have friends. Mr. Allam plays it both like a tough-love father and an ever-believing mentor. The two actors work together beautifully and bring a realness and a relatableness to the relationship.
There are also a few other faces that pop up that will please old fans: Abigail Thaw and young versions of Dr. Debryn and Strange.

In conclusion, watch it. If you're an old fan, you'll love it. If you're new, be warned: you are about to become a fan.

5704971,5,B00C888NFQ,"a lot of TV viewers got their first exposure to the art of the televised British Crime Drama from series like Jeremy Brett in Sherlock Holmes, David Suchet in the Poirot series, and Joan Hickson's Jane Marple (probably the best of the lot).  Clearly, however,  the Colin Dexter novels of Inspector Morse rank among the very best.  Here, we see Inspector Morse begin his career as a police officer, falling in love with Jaguars and indulging his love of Opera and classical music (for the record,  the title Endeavor is Morse's first name, a fact not disclosed in either the original series of programs or in Dexter's books until very late; the explanation is that Morse's mother was a huge fan of the explorations of Captain Cook and his ship, the Endeavor).  This  is a great prequel series and Shaun Evans  makes a very good  Morse.  It's impossible to foresee  how long this series will run but it's probably better than the original John Thaw series.  Evans'  Morse is considerably more likeable, both brilliant and flawed.  The supporting cast is even better if that's possible.  Roger Allams plays Inspector Thursday, Morse's mentor and Anton Lesser brilliantly plays Morse's bureaucratic and political Chief Superintendent Bright, always scheming to undermine Morse's career.  If you enjoy British crime drama,  you owe it to yourself to watch this series or but this DVD. It's addicting as hell but worth every penny.",1377475200,,1425,4.949367088607595

The stories & the characters are complex, appealing & believable.  The addition of the historical, 1930s? context makes them even better.

Morse was such an interesting character with something in his background that made him irritable and secretive. He went by Morse, his last name and was always reluctant to give away his first name, Endeavor.  He seemed like such an outsider in the police station and yet was brilliant as a detective.  I am thrilled that Masterpiece has made it possible to take a look at Morse as a younger man and see his development and more of his life story while he solves the crimes.  This production is excellent in all ways from script to acting to cinematography.

I appreciate all who have brought up this 'edited'  dilemma as I can't stand cut-up versions.  (movie buff and others-thanks)

My DVD of Series One from PBS says Full UK Length Edition on cover.

 For what it is worth-  let me compare unedited UK version to what was shown on TV.  I am very surprised to see how much was cut that was significant from the Endeavour shows  I have on DVR player .  I had no idea that Masterpiece Theatre edited the original British program .  They are not editing out inconsequential scenes  either.

The length on Amazon's version is the same  so I hope  it is unedited  for those that purchased it here.  An easy test is to see whether at the end of 'HOME'  they show Strange taking the sargeants exam but not Morse  and then later Morse does finally goes to the Doctor who tells him he should have come in sooner as he will have a limp in middle age.  ( he went to dying father's beside instead)

Perhaps someone can review their Amazon purchased DVD and settle the question once and for all-- to make sure the  edition offered here  is unedited.

( another tidbit-  Morse admits it was his father who taught him to shoot not the army.  Many other omissions.  )

I am looking forward to viewing the rest of Endeavour  UNEDITED  to enjoy them all over again.

5705005,5,B00C888NFQ,"Most enjoyable and very well done.  As a long time ""Inspector Morse"" fan this is just wonderful to have a series that continues this story.  Actually it takes us back to the beginning when Inspector Morse first goes into the police department, answering so many questions about him.  In the third show of the season Abagail Thaw, John Thaw's daughter plays a newspaper editor.  Her name is D. Frazil.  Frazil is a type of ice and d-frazil means to thaw.  Also there is one scene when she first meets Morse where she comments, ""Don't I know you?"" and Morse replies, ""No I do not think so."" and the says, ""Well maybe in another life.""  She commented in an interview that there was not a dry eye on the set when they did that scene.  Shaun Evans does a great job of playing Morse as a young man.  Many of the same mannerisms, it is so believable.  I cannot wait until the second series comes to DVD.",1376784000,,896,4.343373493975903
5705006,5,B00C888NFQ,all episodes of this series are OUTSTANDING! I have watched these al  two times and will watch them again. Morse and Thursday are terrific as well as all of the cast in each episode. I want series 2!!!,1376784000,,201,4.2894736842105265
5705007,5,B00C888NFQ,"I was a loyal viewer of the original Morse series, and an appreciative fan of the subsequent Lewis series.  I had read some very positive reviews of Endeavour.  But, I was somewhat skeptical at the thought of a young Morse.  So much of his character was attached to his middle aged angst.

What a pleasant surprise.  The Endeavour series is superb.  I believe it to be superior to the original. The period Oxford scene is beautifully presented, as usual.  The acting is outstanding.  Shaun Evans has just the right degree of anxious sensitivity to remind the viewer of his older self.  While his mentor, the phlegmatic Inspector Thursday, shows a credible belief in his young, earnest, but unorthodox protege.

The story lines are eminently plausible, something that was not always true in the original Morse series.  I'm always appreciative of the lack of gratuitous violence in British crime series.  And, the police manage to go about their business without guns!

Each episode unfolds quietly, at its own pace.  The viewer has time to get to know the characters, and care about what happens to them.  A refreshing change to so many fast paced, action packed series thrown at us these days.

Hopefully, Endeavour will be a long running series.

I highly recommend it!",1376784000,,1270,4.887323943661972

5705035,5,B00C888NFQ,"Inspector Morse is probably one of my favourite characters and television programmes. From the UK, I grew up with the series and came to love the irascible character that was Morse, as well as the intriguing plots and often brilliant (yet wrong) deductions on the way to eventual solving of the crime. The anticipation waiting for the next series was always worth it. I was never disappointed.

""Lewis"" for me (although I own every episode), was a second best, having to replace the Morse intellect with Sgt Hathaway. A good solution, but it was never quite 'Morse', enjoyable though it was.

""Endeavour"" brings back to us the very unique Morse character, but with so much more. We now get to see the shaping of the Man who is Morse. Something touched upon in the Colin Dexter books, but never really addressed in the Television stories. We also have some wonderful dialogue and excellent captivation of the mid 60's mix of personalities and conflicting social scenes.

I am afraid that I voraciously consumed the pilot and entire series within a day (thanks to streaming video) and am now rediscovering the sense of eager anticipation that awaited each new Morse series.",1376352000,,1171,4.874371859296482

As much as I love the original, this modern fresh look at ""Morse"" may just be better.  I say ""may"" because well, there was only one John Thaw.  Happily,  Shaun Evans makes young Morse his own and  Roger Allam as Endeavor's mentor is as always, just great. You will really like this ""new"" character thanks to him.

The pilot was a gem, especially the end where we see young Morse for a moment turning into the Morse of the original series, with a touch of the 'Morse' music.

While the series is sheer heaven for those of us who were fans of the original Morse in books and on TV, the show is also an engaging plunge into the world of 1960s policing in England. As with Morse and the Inspector Lewis series, Endeavour is wonderfully atmospheric in its concentration on life and crime in Oxford.

The characters are spot-on, too. Inspector Thursday, young Endeavour Morse's mentor, is a well-developed character whose influence on Morse is clear. As a long-time fan of Morse, I was also delighted to see the future Superintendent Strange portrayed so ably as a young constable (and friend to Endeavour) in this offering.

5705085,4,B00C888NFQ,"""Endeavour"" is back for its first full season with 4 new episodes featuring a young Endeavour Morse in his early days on the Oxford police force, before he became the iconic ""Inspector Morse."" The mysteries take place in 1965. The period details and photography are great. But the title character is made for 21st century tastes. Young Endeavour Morse doesn't resemble his older self of Colin Dexter's novels or of ITV's detective series in the 1990s. Inspector Morse was an introvert but a sensualist and a drinker. Endeavour Morse is a very serious young man who likes opera and cogitates like Sherlock Holmes. He's a geek in the mold of so many detective dramas of late -""Sherlock"", ""CSI"", ""Numb3rs""- transported to the 1960s. The writers are catering to a taste for, and fascination with, nerds in popular culture.

One result is that Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans) is overshadowed by the stronger character of Detective Inspector Fred Thursday (Roger Allam). Allam steals the scenes that he is in. Series 1 introduces Chief Superintendent Bright (Anton Lesser), DI Thursday's old-fashioned and career-minded superior, who doesn't quite trust ambitious young DC Morse or his methods. Detective Sergeant Peter Jakes (Jack Laskey) is Morse's rival on the force, a man of conspicuously ordinary ambitions and ethics. PC Jim Strange (Sean Rigby) is a street cop who has taken a liking to, or developed a tolerance for, Morse's unorthodox ways. Dr. Max Debryn (James Bradshaw) is back as the nerdy pathologist, complete with thick-rimmed glasses and argyle vest. John Thaw's daughter Abigail Thaw plays a recurring minor character in Dorothea Frazil, a local journalist with her finger on the pulse of Oxford politics.

As the Series opens, Detective Constable Morse is trying to rise above general duties with DI Thursday's support. He'll soon be taking his Sergent's Exam. The mysteries are generally good, though, as is common in television detective dramas, little attention is paid to plausibility or whether the solutions make sense. The filmmakers don't expect the audience to think it through. Shaun Evans is obviously too old for the role, but he plays it well enough, as long as we keep in mind that he is playing some kind of post-War nerd, not John Thaw's younger self. I really don't think this would succeed without Roger Allam as Thursday, and much credit is due the supporting actors who embody unlikable characters perfectly: Anton Lesser and Jack Laskey. They make scenes interesting that would be dull otherwise. All four episodes have one-word titles. They are:

Morse has been promoted from general duties to detective duties, based on merit, which scandalizes the department somewhat, in ""Girl"", the first of the series. A 20-year-old secretarial student, Margaret Bell (Fiona Ryan), is found dead in her bed, apparently due to a heart condition, but Morse suspects that there may be more to it. Meanwhile, series' of violent postal hold-ups and gas meter robberies occupy the department with more mundane cases. But when a Dr. Cartwright (Dominic Taylor), the partner of Margaret's GP, is shot to death, it strengthens Morse's convictions that there is more to the case, leading him to the sordid affairs of Cartwright's widow's (Olivia Grant) family, who are connected to the University through Helen's father (Jonathan Hyde), a physics professor who has been receiving threatening letters. Keeping with the geek theme, there is cryptography in this one.

In ""Fugue"", Morse is back to general duties at the insistence of Chief Superintendent Bright. He discovers words from Verdi's opera ""Othello"" written at the scene of a murder, where a woman was found strangled. When a widowed botanist is found poisoned by one of her plants, and another operatic inscription is found at the scene, it begins to appear that the culprit is playing a game with investigators. A psychiatrist named Dr. Croyn (Geoffrey Streatfeild) is brought in as a consultant. He specializes in a new type of murderer: the serial killer, which he believes are a coming trend. More bodies add to the pile of clues, each victim killed in a manner depicted in an opera. And onus is on Morse, in particular, to solve the riddle and track down the killer, as he is the only one who knows anything about opera. The killer seems to have singled Morse out for special attention.

""Rocket"" finds the ""British Imperial Electric Company"" hosting a royal visit to its munitions factory in hopes of selling it's new, high-tech missile. Princess Margaret and a Jordanian Prince are in attendance, and the police are charged with providing extra security. Unfortunately, an unpopular worker named Percy Malleson (James Merry) is found stabbed to death shortly after the event. The union suspected that Malleson was a spy. The Broom family, who own the company, are in the midst of sensitive business negotiations and bickering amongst themselves. President Henry Bloom's (Martin Jarvis) personal assistant Alice (Maime McCoy) is an old acquaintance of Morse who carries a torch for him. Due to the royal visit, the case is politically sensitive, and Thursday is encouraged by Chief Superintendent Bright to wrap it up quickly even if that means cutting corners.

Oxford don Alistair Coke Norris (Paul Venables) is found dead in the road, victim of an apparent hit-and-run in ""Home"". Among his effects are a matchbook from the Moonlight Room nightclub, with a phone number written inside. The Moonlight Room is owned by a London mobster named Vic Kaspar (Clive Wood), whom DI Thursday holds in deep contempt, as the two have a violent history. Kaspar claims he has retired and is now running a legitimate nightclub. It turns out that Professor Coke Norris was killed en route to a city council meeting where he was scheduled to speak against the sale of some college land, a parcel called Booth Hill, to a real estate developer. Both the college and the many investors stood to profit if the deal went through, but there has been talk of bribery and corruption. Meanwhile, Morse prepares for his sergeant's exam, and his father has fallen ill.",1375315200,5,6119,5.059464816650149
5705086,5,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour Morse aka 'Inspector Morse' in the BBC series from 1987-2000, is the younger, unsure Morse, brilliant  but not socially secure, he might be known as having Aspergers in this day and age.  'Endeavour' takes us back to his younger days in the 1960's, where he is a Detective Constable. This is the second year in this series. The first year was an introduction and was well received.

 Morse is played by Shaun Evans, and Detective Inspector Fred Thursday, played by Roger Allam, is his mentor. DI Thursday saw great promise in DC Morse, and a kindred spirit, of sorts. In this series we see DI Thursday at home with his wife and older children. DC Morse has breakfast with them at one point, and socially awkward is the name of the game.  We also get to see DC Morse visit his home in one episode. His father is very ill, and their relationship is almost non-existent. We meet his step mother who has no use for Endeavour, and we see Endeavour visit his mother's grave, and we understand that this is where his heart lies. Morse loves the Opera and sings in the local choir. He has no time for anything else but his work. Disheveled hair and suit, I wanted to give him a hug.

The four episodes in this second series are well written with plenty of action, but it is DC Morse's intelligence that puts two and two together and solves most of the crimes. There is a new CS, played by Anton Lesser, who reminds me more of an old spinster, but who cracks the whip. He is not a fan of Morse, Morse is unusual and does not play the usual get ahead at work games, but the  CS does appreciate Morse's youth and intelligence.

I enjoyed this second series, felt like I was finally getting to know my beloved Morse.  He is quick and endearing, and his mentor DI Thursday is the exact kind of man to help Morse further his career. We remember the older Morse, and his side-kick Det. Lewis, and have a better understanding of the mentor and their relationship.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-31-13",1375228800,7,1995,4.456043956043956

5705088,5,B00C888NFQ,"I was really sad to read that there would be no more episodes of Inspector Lewis, my favorite series. I then ran across the pilot for Endeavour, penned by Russell Lewis, who was, either the writer or screenwriter for some of my favorite programs: the Sharpe's series, five episodes of Cadfael, several of The Heat of the Sun series, and the pilot and four episodes of the Inspector Lewis series.
I was not disappointed. The series focuses on Morse's early days in the police force, and shows how his character developed: his quirkiness, love of opera, weakness for women and spikiness. More than that, the story lines never take cliched  routes, and there is something wonderfully understated about the whole endeavor. Sean Evans is marvelous as the brilliant, hyper educated Morse, who always seems ill at ease in his sole suit of clothing, or is it his own skin, since he has no real sense of belonging, and knows it.  His superior, the thoughtful Thursday, is brilliantly underplayed by Roger Allum. The period sets are remarkable--shabby, drab, underlit and the costuming and hair reflect the era well. I can hardly wait for more.",1375056000,12,1134,4.870466321243524
5705099,5,B00C888NFQ,"This DVD contains the Pilot episode as well as Season One which has 4 episodes. This series is incredibly good. I can hardly wait to see more of the development of the man who became the sometimes curmudgeonly, often wrong-footed and always admirable Morse of the original series. The team that is working on this really know their ""Morse"" and ""Lewis"" series and seem to delight in connecting all the elements of the original Colin Dexter novels. Everything about the series speaks of a labor of love. It returns to the start of Morse's career which viewers have seen in the ""Inspector Morse"" series and the continuation of the series with the more recent ""Lewis"" series which follows the later career of Morse's much put-upon Sgt. Lewis on his return to Oxford.

Morse is still known by his first name ""Endeavour,"" a virtue name given by his Quaker mother and his father, who was a fan of Captain James Cook whose ship was the HMS Endeavour, or by his nickname of Pagan given him during his student days at Oxford. He has returned to Oxford in 1965 as a Detective Constable to help investigate the case of a missing schoolgirl in the pilot. DI Thursday ( superb deep-voiced actor Roger Allam) recognizes Morse is a detective not a policeman and keeps him on and becomes his mentor. Another young constable named Strange is recognizable to Morse fans and a nicely done touch.

All three series, of course, really star the beautiful, but not so perfect, city of Oxford and its unique place in British life.

I suggest the episode ""Fugue"" is one of the best stories and dramas I remember seeing. For me it was a 3-hankie event and evoked os much in both the original series which I was also watching at the time. All the episodes are well-written and well-acted. Where has Shaun Evans been all this time? (Well, you can find him in ""Whitechapel"" Season 3.1, 3.2 for one.)

5705103,5,B00C888NFQ,"These are simply wonderful.  I am a great Thaw fan, with the wooden-boxed Morse set, the Kavanagh QC set and other work.  I love the Lewis series and am exploring some of Kevin Whately's independent work.  In each Oxford series there is a strong relationship between the partners: Morse/Lewis, Lewis/Hathaway, so much so that the shows present us with virtual co-stars.  In the Endeavour series, a young Morse is guided by an older Detective Inspector, played by Roger Allam.  Except for an occasional sighting of Allam I had only seen him in a brilliant comic role on the London stage, in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia.  In Endeavour, he and Shaun Evans are truly exceptional.  As in the best of all British mystery/suspense, the personal relationships are at the core of the story and are key to its success.

In my opinion, the Endeavour series is the best of the Morse/Lewis/Endeavour trilogy and that is a very difficult league in which to compete.  The series is, of course, a prequel, with Evans playing a young detective constable, learning from an older man, but displaying his unique gifts.  Each are hampered by a time-serving, risk-averse, chain-smoking supervisor.  Morse also intersects with a smarmy, difficult detective sergeant, who envies him, and a husky police constable named Strange who continually calls Morse `matey'.  He, of course, will eventually become the mature Morse's supervisor.

The series is exceptional for the usual (though elusive) reasons.  The scripts are superb.  Both Morse and Lewis have a tendency, at times, to present convoluted stories.  The characters are excellent, of course, but at the end you have to think very hard to recapitulate what actually just happened and who did exactly what.  The Endeavour scripts are leaner and tighter and a bit more clear.  The performances are spectacular.  DI Fred Thursday (Allam) is a loving but strong mentor.  He has everything that Morse lacks: a wife, family and broad experience.  Morse, of course, has everything that Thursday lacks: technical knowledge, an Oxford education and a quirky, apparently non-linear but ultimately very-linear way of thinking.  Morse solves the cases without diminishing or upstaging Thursday and Thursday protects Morse within the bureaucracy and provides the wind beneath what are fast becoming broad wings.  Evans nails Morse's personality and gestures and captures the character's essential loneliness.

We never quite know why Morse does what he does--an educated, opera-loving homicide detective.  The mysteries of his personality are part of his attractiveness.  He is no pasteboard figure.  We know that he will never achieve personal happiness because that is who he is and that is what makes him, in part, so successful in his professional role.  He will never have the love that he seeks and so we give it to him.

The direction is superb: lean without being minamilist.  The pacing is slow but deliberate and intense, without resorting to gimmickry.  Costuming is excellent and we have a sense of the period without it becoming an intrusive distraction.  Roger Allam really knows how to smoke a pipe.  It is not a prop but a part of his personality.  Evans always looks comfortable in himself but simultaneously disheveled.  It is who he is.  He has all of the great Holmes traits--specialized knowledge, the powers of `deduction', a kind of otherworldliness, the absence of a true, personal life, and so on, without ever consciously evoking the Holmes character.

Each time I watch an episode of Endeavour there is a sense of calm and completeness, that feeling that comes when you are in the presence of great art--the realization that you have just witnessed something done incomparably well.  You are moved emotionally but also moved by the sense that you have just experienced the work of master craftsmen.

(The BBC versions of Sherlock are likewise better than the PBS version.) We are very disappointed in the PBS presentation of Endeavor; the BBC version is far better. If you have a all-region DVD player, or can borrow one, do indulge in the BBC version; it's well worth the extra cash and effort.",1374969600,36,653,4.6869565217391305
5705107,5,B00C888NFQ,"I admit I was initially skeptical about this show which is a prequel to the Inspector Morse series. I am a great fan of the original show and have watched the episodes many times over, discovering something new each time and appreciating the stellar performances of John Thaw as DCI Morse and Kevin Whately as DS Lewis. I am glad to say that I enjoy this series and find the acting credible and the storylines compelling. I have this DVD in the UK version which will only play on a multi-region DVD player and is not compatible with US Region 1 DVD players.

Shaun Evans plays a young Endeavour Morse, a brilliant young man who never quite managed to complete his degree at Oxford and joins the Oxford police force as a detective constable. Morse's trademark solitary habits are evident here and I could absolutely believe how the mature, older Morse came to be as he is depicted in the Inspector Morse series. Shaun Evans delivers a credible performance, from the little mannerisms unique to Morse, e.g. the hands cupping the chin, to the interest in Jaguars, an appreciation for opera, fine ale, and of course the fascination for the opposite sex. Viewers learn how Morse's liking for a certain kind of woman develops - the sort who is enigmatic, beautiful, talented, but always just a little bit out of reach, well for the most part anyway.

In the series, young Endeavour rubs some of his colleagues the wrong way, especially an older DC (played by Jack Ashton) who resents Morse's obvious brilliance, but luckily for Morse, he finds a mentor in DI Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) who sees the potential in young Morse and takes him under his wing. The interaction between Endeavour and Thursday is quite a treat to watch, though admittedly not at the level of banter between John Thaw's Morse and Kevin Whately's Lewis. Look out for Morse's encounter with the young PC Jim Strange (Sean Rigby) and their developing friendship which is of course significant given that Strange ends up as Chief Superintendent Strange (James Grout) in the original series, Inspector Morse.

The cases investigated here are compelling and I enjoyed watching young Morse go about unearthing clues to solve them. I hope to see many more episodes featuring young Morse (I read that a second season of ""Endeavour"" has been commissioned by ITV).",1374969600,4,2321,4.81203007518797

When LEWIS came out, I loved it as well, especially the relationship between Lewis and his sidekick. The relationships in MORSE and LEWIS are as interesting as the murder mysteries. One of the delights of MORSE was that he was usually wrong the first time and then worked to get it right by the end. ENDEAVOUR is a worthy addition to both of these series. Here we have the young Morse, who usually gets it wrong the first time and right by the end, plus his problems with choosing women who are wounded birds, the same theme music which works the Morse code for Morse into the underlying rhythm and the origin stories which explain how he came to be the adult version of himself. We even get the origin of Constable Strange and the pathologist and their relationships with Morse. Inspector Thursday I have come to admire. He is a good 'father figure' for Morse and his relationship with Morse is a delight to watch. Too bad that Morse couldn't become more like him; his life would have probably been happier. And of course, cameos of Colin Dexter, the author of the books. If you like a good murder mystery with a lot of suspects running around, a well-written plot and beautiful scenery of Oxford, you will like these series as much as I do. If I could give it a 10, I would. Now if they would only come out with MORSE and the early LEWIS series in blu-ray.",1374624000,,1447,4.362962962962963
5705126,4,B00C888NFQ,"Following up on last year's premier are four new episodes featuring a young Endeavour Morse in his early days on the job, circa 1965.  While not  physically resembling the late John Thaw, the young actor Shaun Evans has obviously done his homework and mastered many of the mannerisms Thaw brought to the role.  Additionally, they've incorporated little details from the original series creating a tacit connection between the two productions.  These touchstones are so well done that viewers not familiar with ""Inspector Morse"" will likely assume them to be part of the narrative dialogue, while knowledgeable fans will readily spot the homage.  Besides establishing early relationships with pathologist Max de Bryn and future Chief Superintendent Jim Strange, they managed a couple sly references to one of Morse' romantic rivals, Sir Alex Reece, a future Master of fictional Beaumont College and significant character in ""The Last Enemy"".

As in the premier an ongoing role has been created for Abby Thaw, the eldest of John Thaw's three daughters. This is a particularly nice touch and seems typical of the obvious care they've taken in producing a series worthy of the original production.  Likewise, veteran British actor Roger Allam reprises his role as Morse'  mentor, DI Fred Thursday.  Allam  played a major character in ""Death is Now My Neighbor"", an ""Inspector Morse"" film from the late 1990's.  Additionally, 83 year old Colin Dexter has a cameo in at least two of the episodes signifying his approval of this prequel to the eponymous novels.  Finally, Barrington Pheloung has again been commissioned to score the individual episodes and each opens and closes with the beautiful and evocative theme from the original series.  This is a top tier production and the writing, casting, and production values are as good as anything on television.

So why not 5 stars?  Well, to be honest the premier and first four episodes merit a 5 star rating, but Masterpiece Mystery is a co-producer and has had a checkered history since it's debut as an investor in  UK productions.  While the  Morse sequel, ""Inspector Lewis"", had a small but loyal following it never developed into a serious production rivaling it's predecessor.  Early on PBS tried to pawn off the badly edited television broadcasts in the Lewis DVD packages only to find many customers purchasing the full length UK versions instead.  The episodes in the first two Lewis seasons were all 104 minutes to fit the 2 hour commercial UK time slot, but PBS tried to shoehorn them into their 90 minute commercial free window.  When you net out the superfluous added Masterpiece content there's a lot of original UK video left on the editing room floor.  The premier of ""Inspector Lewis"" was shown intact on the original PBS Mystery!, a time flexible venue. But when the series was picked up two years later by newly created Masterpiece Mystery they adopted a 90 minute window which meant all the initial 104 minute episodes were trimmed pretty significantly.  This exposed PBS to all manner of criticism.  By Series 3 an exasperated PBS, having had enough of the carping, exercised their co-producer clout and demanded all the editions, including the UK master, be cut back approximately 10 minutes which left a more manageable core product for them to further edit for broadcast in the lucrative North American market.  They then disingenuously adopted the official UK edition* claim, but by this time the series had devolved into little more than a campus police procedural and suffered in quality compared to it's predecessor.  ""Endeavour"" is following a similar pattern as the premier ran 104 minutes, but the first 4 episodes just 93 minutes.  By comparison, all of the original Morse films were 104 minutes. When writers cut back screenplays they inevitably eliminate the quiet conversations and introspective moments that make great characters.  The problem is not that you have a shortened film, but that the film is fundamentally weakened.  It becomes less character driven and more reliant on plot alone which is the antithesis of the qualities so admired in the ""Inspector Morse"" series.  Thus far they have been up to the task of crafting compelling dramas in the shortened format but talented staff can leave and be replaced, particularly if interfering co-producers create problems, hence my concern.  Another minor, yet curious lapse in continuity between the two series is the character of DI Thursday.  This persona is a creation of the current ""deviser""  rather than a portrayal of Morse' actual mentor, D.I. McNutt, who played a prominent role in the Morse film ""Masonic Mysteries"" and was referenced several times in the Dexter novels.  Absent any credible explanation for why they manufactured a new character for Roger Allam to portray just seems like a blown opportunity to build off the original series and add another touch point to Dexter's novels.

Additionally, I fear the scripts are going to rely too heavily on Endeavour's familiarity with the arts and academia as the premier and 2 of the first 4 episodes were only resolved with his knowledge of classical music.  A problem with the aforementioned ""Inspector Lewis"" was that the series fell into a thematic rut by having the majority of episodes focused on the colleges. By contrast the Morse scripts were varied and balanced between Oxford's infamous ""town and gown"" social tension.  A good half of the Morse films were situated outside of the town entirely, dealing with the greater Thames Valley and beyond. These had little, if any, connection to the academic community. With Lewis they seized on one small aspect of the successful Morse series and beat it into the ground. It's early days for ""Endeavour"", but the dramas thus far seem a little too centered around the title character's affinity for opera and choral music.  While the mature Morse did dabble in amateur choir and often purchased (and then misplaced) tickets to operatic performances, he was a Wagnerian at heart and, as any music lover knows, Wagner men rarely need protection from punctilious superintendents or envious sergeants as Endeavour has thus far been portrayed. I understand that they want to solidify his personality and establish the early struggle for acceptance, but a little goes a long way and even the best screen writers can have problems letting their characters mature and develop. This is particularly critical in a prequel where a knowledgable audience will likely want to see Endeavour progress into the Morse they know as quickly as possible. The risk is that the writers get stuck painting the character as a troubled introvert who's academic background is over emphasized.  John Thaw's Morse was neither troubled, introverted, nor overtly intellectual. He was a thoughtful criminal investigator who got it wrong almost as often as he got it right.  He just happened to have an elite education, a penchant for literary quotes and, upon occasion, a perverse streak that would compel him to  assume the most unlikely of motives, all of which could make police work more complex than he, or his colleagues, were comfortable with. The premier Morse film (adapted from Colin Dexter's fifth novel) set the stage where he mistakenly believed one of the Theban plays held the key to a woman's death. It was the first of many wild goose chases he and (then) DS Lewis would embark upon. Dexter wrote the character as being a little short on ""who did it"", but a master of ""why it was done"". In fact, Morse only rarely solved cases in the traditional sense as most played out with Shakespearian inevitability while he stood witness to the frailties of the human condition.  Unlike Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes, Morse became a legendary character, not because of any great skill in forensic detection, but because he could make sense of those frailties through the prism of his own life experience.  Not an easy task for a screen writer and young actor to replicate.

A final word regarding the star rating; the discs include the same brand advertising for a cruise ship line and fashion designer that PBS ran on the TV broadcasts. They did the same thing with the final season of ""Inspector Lewis"".  This material could have easily been edited out and it makes one wonder if including it for additional compensation wasn't a bit crass. I don't have any problem with PBS adopting advertising as a revenue source, but it's beyond the pale to include it in the DVD sets customers pay for. It's one thing to have a distributor include trailers of other films in their catalog, but actual paid advertising for third party commercial interests?  If you were to purchase a season of another network's TV series and were subjected to toothpaste and insurance commercials most people would be rightfully upset.  Including advertising in a home video product seems particularly bush league when you consider that PBS still clings to the illusion of being a high minded, commercial free network that preached ethical superiority for decades.  As I said, I don't have any problem with their adoption of advertising as a revenue source, just their bone-headed insistence that it be included as an unwelcome addition to the disc sets. This sort of thing only demeans PBS and all that it has stood for since it's inception as National Education Television in 1952.  Be that as it may, the actual production has made all the right artistic moves and my hesitation to adopt full throated enthusiasm stems solely from the ongoing threat of PBS exercising more ill advised creative control over content.

5705138,5,B00C888NFQ,"No, I daren't say it's 'better than Morse', but I would venture that it's wonderfully 'different', its own entity entirely. The mysteries are a tad complicated (and at times, convoluted), yet it is the characters that drive this beautifully filmed period piece. Shaun Evans is mesmerizing as the young Inspector Morse (long before he became an inspector, of course), and all eyes tend to be on him (that's not to say that his supporting cast aren't wonderful, too - because they certainly are). Beautifully filmed, each shot is framed to perfection, and the period details (those 'shabby-chic' British homes before they were 'chic', and still just 'shabby) are perfectly rendered, as are the period costumes.

There are nuances here that might be lost on American audiences; chiefly, the little 'class struggle' between the posh and educated Morse and his immediate superior, an aspiring lower middle-class toady (the British police force is the domain of the working class/lower middle-class; this proves the source of much dramatic tension between Morse and many of his peers), and this is played out with subtle perfection in many of the scenes.

Lacking the warmth of 'Foyle's War', one still ends up feeling a warmth towards the characters in Endeavour (most notably Morse's superior, Fred Thursday, as well as the adorable Sgt Strange), yet it is strong yet subtle performance by Shaun Evans that makes 'Endeavour' shine.

John Thaw, of course, was the original Morse.  Great series.  Shaun Evans is fun to watch.  Looking forward to many more episodes.",1374105600,185,563,4.946236559139785

5705147,5,B00C888NFQ,"If you liked Inspector Morse you will love Endeavour.  The series explains everything you loved about Inspector Morse and you'll find that what you suspected about him was, in fact, the absolute truth.  In addition to the young Morse, you will meet earlier versions of his associates, Max the M.E., and Patrolman Strange, who you know as Morse's boss.  The music is impeccable, as is the casting, and the acting.  My only concern is the series will not run forever.",1373846400,4,465,4.775
5705158,5,B00C888NFQ,"This series is off to a superb start with a talented young actor picking up many of the quirks and mannerisms of the unforgettable John Thaw character.  The eyes may not be quite as blue, but the romanticism and emotional entanglement ring very true to the older Morse character.  Bringing back the man who would become Chief Superintendent Strange was a nice touch and we witness over time how the awkward, overweight police constable and Morse begin to build a mutual respect and regard.  As with the John Thaw character, this youthful Morse is absorbed in his own complex lines and styles of inquiry causing perplexity and bewilderment on the part of senior officers until all is revealed. Excellent treat for mystery buffs!

Each of the four mysteries in this set delivers the view a complex puzzle and set of relationships that sometimes requires several viewings to absorb all of the nuances. Over all four episodes (and the pilot) the viewer sees the character and uncompromising integrity of Morse slowly revealed as well as the ""rough edges"" he displays in the John Thaw series.",1373241600,6,1087,4.891304347826087
5705159,5,B00C888NFQ,"If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years, you will be delighted to know that the series is being revived in a new form.

John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the policeman's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?

But now enters the new younger Morse in this series Endeavour, which is a prequel to the iconic series. Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name Endeavour. However, the author Colin Dexter, supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.

Is this new endeavor worthy of the old series? I found it to be so. The younger Morse is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music, women witnesses, crossword puzzles, literature classics, stubbornness and tenacity is already in evidence. The production values I found to be superior to the old series. The sets for example--the police station, Morse's apartment rental, and even the car repair shop were amazing. The cinematography was original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera etc.

The actors were stand-outs: Endeavor's boss and ""the governor"" or chief of police, the car dealer, the other police supervisors, the suspects, and an old friend of Endeavor's at Oxford. It was an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor--you could see a bit of her father's face in hers.

The crime was appropriately complex, involving a professor at Oxford. So, even though we miss Mr. Thaw, it appears the new actor, Shaun Evans, has the potential to mature into the role of Morse. Loved the morphing of Evan's face into Thaw's face in the rear-view mirror--a dramatic touch.

Can't wait for the next episodes of this brilliant and well-done series. We hope it will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series.",1373155200,134,2739,4.7923728813559325
5705160,5,B00C888NFQ,"I had watched this series on T.V. and enjoyed it. There were just enough references to Morse Sr. to emphasize the connection. I thought Shaun Evans whom I had not seen before was certainly quite adequate in the role of Morse Jr. He did not play it as I would have imagined young Morse, but was convincing in his own way. Roger Allam was also convincing as his governor and the Morse connection was emphasized by having Constable Strange play a significant role. There was all the excitement of the Morse series itself and I have to congratulate the script writers.",1372896000,9,564,4.594059405940594
5705161,5,B00C888NFQ,"PBS edits 10-15 minutes out of each episode that they show on ""Masterpiece Mystery.""  I am hesitant to purchase any version of ""Endeavour Series 1"" that does not say 'Original UK Edition' on the front of the DVD.  Beware!  You sure don't want to buy the edited versions!  These programs are so fabulous, there isn't a single gratuitous instant in them that isn't required to fully understand the story.  Caveat emptor!",1372464000,377,418,4.830985915492958
5705162,2,B00C888NFQ,"Endeavour is a contrived series, capitalizing on John Thaw's superb Morse.  So what's new?  Kevin Whatley's Lewis is also contrived and, for my money nearly worthless.  Mr. Whatley is a fine actor but he's not Compelling or Deep or Arresting or Evocative the way Thaw was.  You can barely see him, let alone explore the depths of human feeling with him.  Thaw was a great actor.  Whatley is good at sending out for coffee.  They just made Endeavour and Lewis for the money.  Everything has become formulaic and trite.  Do you really want to watch these shows a second time?  Looking at an old Morse episode has almost become a devout, life-affirming ritual.  I am not reconciled to these spinoffs.

Laurance Fox is another matter!  Retire Lewis immediately and promote Mr. Fox to Inspector Hathaway!  If Fox is too young get James Bolam.  I believe he's free?  And, whatever you do keep Clare Holman!!  Endeavour should open a pub or switch to poetry.",1372377600,13,951,4.736196319018405
5705163,5,B00C888NFQ,"I admit I was initially skeptical about this show which is a prequel to the Inspector Morse series. I am a great fan of the original show and have watched the episodes many times over, discovering something new each time and appreciating the stellar performances of John Thaw as DCI Morse and Kevin Whately as DS Lewis. I am glad to say that I enjoy this series and find the acting credible and the storylines compelling. I have this DVD in the UK version which will only play on a multi-region DVD player and is not compatible with US Region 1 DVD players.

Shaun Evans plays a young Endeavour Morse, a brilliant young man who never quite managed to complete his degree at Oxford and joins the Oxford police force as a detective constable. Morse's trademark solitary habits are evident here and I could absolutely believe how the mature, older Morse came to be as he is depicted in the Inspector Morse series. Shaun Evans delivers a credible performance, from the little mannerisms unique to Morse, e.g. the hands cupping the chin, to the interest in Jaguars, an appreciation for opera, fine ale, and of course the fascination for the opposite sex. Viewers learn how Morse's liking for a certain kind of woman develops - the sort who is enigmatic, beautiful, talented, but always just a little bit out of reach, well for the most part anyway.

In the series, young Endeavour rubs some of his colleagues the wrong way, especially an older DC (played by Jack Ashton) who resents Morse's obvious brilliance, but luckily for Morse, he finds a mentor in DI Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) who sees the potential in young Morse and takes him under his wing. The interaction between Endeavour and Thursday is quite a treat to watch, though admittedly not at the level of banter between John Thaw's Morse and Kevin Whately's Lewis. Look out for Morse's encounter with the young PC Jim Strange (Sean Rigby) and their developing friendship which is of course significant given that Strange ends up as Chief Superintendent Strange (James Grout) in the original series, Inspector Morse.

The cases investigated here are compelling and I enjoyed watching young Morse go about unearthing clues to solve them. I hope to see many more episodes featuring young Morse (I read that a second season of ""Endeavour"" has been commissioned by ITV).",1371513600,104,2321,4.81203007518797
5705164,5,B00C888NFQ,"Shaun Evans' eyes aren't as blue as John Thaw's were, but he is credible as a young Morse. I have only seen the first episode on PBS and I am looking forward to seeing the rest of these episodes. I hope this series tells us more about Morse's background.

My issue with all the episodes is that they are way too contrived, especially episode 4. For me a good mystery has to be not only thrilling, but also believable. So while the stories were fairly suspenseful, the denouements were fairly disappointing, as in unconvincing. I enjoyed Marchlands and Lightfields a lot more.",1370736000,16,426,4.693333333333333

This series, with great sensitivity, explains so much about the young police detective Morse that you will understand the original Morse series so much better after watching this series.
