5787361,5,B00DBPBP8C,"Ordered both season 1 and season 2. If you are a sports lover this is for you.
Each episode gives you the personal life story as well as each players sports story.",1389571200,,163,4.125
5787362,5,B00DBPBP8C,"This is also great like Season 1.  I hope the prices can be a little better in the future.
Everyone should see these.",1389571200,,117,4.086956521739131
5787363,4,B00DBPBP8C,"High quality production that NFL is know for.  Since I have watched all the episodes on NFL Network, I wanted this DVD for my personal library.  Delivery was prompt.",1388707200,3,165,4.655172413793103
5787364,5,B00DBPBP8C,"NFL Films have built on the strong foundations of the first season with another diverse collection of ""football lives"" ranging from coaches to owners to players past and present through to the iconic ""Immaculate Reception"". Each story is stunningly told, crafted with loving care, whilst some have genuine emotional power, notably Chris Spielman and the Fearsome Foursome. I particularly enjoyed the story of Bill Belichick's last year in Cleveland as the owner works to take the team to another city. Some episodes are less compelling than others, however, this probably comes back to personal choice. There is something worthwhile in every episode and some of the game footage is stunning, especially  Barry Sanders and Marcus Allen running the ball. As I said in my review of Season 1, this is world class sporting television, highlighting the humanity of the subjects, as well as their talents. I recommend this unreservedly to anyone interested in sports and inspirational stories, as well as fans of American football.",1388361600,4,1024,5.2439024390243905
5787365,5,B00DBPBP8C,"Great stories on Ray Lewis, 1985 Browns, and Barry Sanders. Well done in hour long segments. NFL Films is top notch.",1385856000,,116,4.571428571428571
5787366,5,B00DBPBP8C,"If you enjoy NFL Football and like to take a peak behind the scenes, you'll love this DVD set. A Football Life, Season 2 follows the same pattern as season 1 with an inside look at the players, coaches, and people that make the NFL special.

With profiles of former players Barry Sanders, Marcus Allen, and Ray Lewis to coaches Jimmy Johnson and Tom Coughlin, this set shows the diversity of what personalities are under the football gear or headsets.

My two favorite episodes are from the early years, mainly late 60's to early 70's. The Immaculate Reception from the '72 playoff game between Pittsburgh and Oakland is a classic game that people still debate to this day. The controversy whether Franco Harris caught a legally thrown ball to the protest of Raiders players and coaches, this is stuff you didn't see on tv or hear about till years later. John Madden did not want to be interviewed for this show, which proves how much emotion is still in the air today.

The Fearsome Foursome is an inside look at the front four of The Los Angeles Rams. From the early years of racial tension, to how Merlin Olsen, Rosie Grier, Lamar Lundy and Deacon Jones became close teammates and remained close after football.

I hope NFL Films and NFL Network keep putting out these wonderful DVD's for the fans who deserve nothing but the best.",1378252800,15,1334,4.639830508474576
5787377,5,B00DBPBP8C,Everyone needs to watch these. Really puts a new and wonderful light on the game and those guys we love to watch. So well done. Even love the music. I probably tear up on every one of them. And I hate to do that. Way to go NFL network. Thanks for giving me football all year long.,1440633600,,280,3.9298245614035086
5787378,5,B00DBPBP8C,"I purchased the 1st season, and this one is a bit of a let down for the people interviewed. But overall, great quality from NFLNetwork. Will be purchasing Season 3 when its released in September/October.",1436054400,,203,4.828571428571428
5787379,5,B00DBPBP8C,This was a gift for my husband.  I'd given him Season 1 a few years ago and he described as wonderfully done and he was ecstatic to get this one.,1435881600,,145,3.8333333333333335
5787380,5,B00DBPBP8C,"This film series is my favorite production of all time. I am a communications major, and my dream job would be to work alongside NFL Films. They put so much passion and time into these, you can feel how much they care about it as you watch. I coached middle school football for two years before returning to school, and I would have the kids watch these to teach them about former NFL greats. If you are even a casual fan of professional football, I would recommend this DVD set.",1433116800,,479,4.333333333333333
5787381,5,B00DBPBP8C,"I bought this DVD and Season One for my husband as a gift for Valentine's Day, and it came in perfect condition. We enjoy watching the show on television, and had seen most of the episodes previously, but I thought it would be nice to purchase all of the episodes so that we could catch up on any we missed, and re-watch our favorites at our leisure. The package arrived on time, which was nice, and was packaged nicely so as not to damage the items. They were listed as ""New"", and arrived in plastic wrapping with no scratches or dents. Definitely worth the money.",1430524800,,565,4.390476190476191

5787392,5,B00DBPBP8C,"Love this series, and can't wait for season 3 to come out. Not all of the episodes are for all ages, some of the men have been through hard times. Those are still good for older kids to see, to learn from, and hear about though.",1418601600,,228,3.9782608695652173

5787394,5,B00DBPBP8C,This is a terrific series. Very well directed and very interesting. My favorite episode is Cleveland 95 which they talk about how the groundwork for the Ravens winning the Super Bowl was paved by Bill Belichick.

5787402,5,B00DBPBP8C,"Yet another fantastic a/v gem birthed by the Sabol family progeny from deep inside their lair in Mount Laurel, N.J. All of these shows are enjoyable to watch, as were those from season one--as are most NFL Films productions since the early to mid-1960s. The production value alone was worth the initial run through and the stories are compelling, each one in its own way. I particularly enjoyed watching all of the known filmed or videotaped camera angle shots of not-so-immaculate incomplete turf-trapped and illegally double-touched pass by former Penn State icon Franco Harris who followed his ""Italian Army"" convoy into that vintage cookie-cutter end zone in the wake of uncalled clipping penalties in Three Rivers Stadium on that fateful day of blue collar delusion that has since been rhetorically weaved into our consciousness and the lore and mythology of the NFL by those very same purveyors of Mount Laurel magic that produced the wonderful DVD which to which this particular review is directed. Anyone with a functioning visual system who has watched major league shortstops glove the baseball on a short hop, knows the kinetic postural changes involved with successfully gloving the ball--exactly the same postural changes displayed by Franco's head, trunk and shoulder girdle as he scooped up that pigskin from the cold Three Rivers turf. The body language and parlance of the former Steelers involved with that play clarify the obvious subterfuge even more so. Even loud-mouthed (and very entertaining) Pittsburgh sports radio homer Mark Madden had openly admitted on a different NFL Films production, NFL's TOP TEN PITTSBURGH STEELERS, that Franco Harris had obviously trapped the ball. But who cares? The rich mythology and the delusion live on as extremely fun topics of conversation, as well as friendly fiery debate for those who indulge--all because NFL Films is that darn good. ""The Immaculate Reception"" episode even went as far as having featured a bumbling ""Professor Emeritus"" from Carnegie Melon, John Fetkovich PhD. Fetkovich summarily went on to destroy all of his legitimate hard-earned scientific credentials by making absolutely ludicrous conclusions from data obtained from the performance of a poorly designed experiment based on the conservation of momentum. This experiment involved the throwing of a football against a brick wall, to the delight of the entire viewership. Doctor Fetkovich concluded that the ball had hit Jack Tatum, not John ""Frenchy"" Fuqua, i.e., disqualifying the double-touch penalty component of the controversy. Meanwhile, as featured in this episode, it was a locker room interview with sports reporters immediately after the game during which John Fuqua himself had freely admitted to the world that Terry Bradshaw's desperation pass had hit HIS OWN chest. During that same post-game locker room celebration, Fuqua was subsequently ""counseled"" on the no-no of publically admitting the truth about this, because of its ramifications on causing the outcome of the game to be viewed as being illegitimate(legitimately so). Since that very moment, Fuqua has maintained the altered version of the story--a fact that has enabled his ability to land lucrative public speaking engagements. The sublime becomes patently surreal when the viewing audience is asked to believe the rhetoric put forth on this issue by a former CIA director--LOL! That was a master stroke, likely attributable to NFL Films myth-making genius Bob Ryan (who is probably best known for having coined the legendary phrase ""America's Team,"" as originally uttered by NFL Films legendary voice John Facenda in the introduction of the 1978 NFL Films Dallas Cowboy highlight reel, since used as the moniker for arguably America's most popular NFL team. The Immaculate Reception also featured compelling human interest stories, such as the guy who maintains the ""Immaculate"" pigskin in a vault and elucidating the term coining origin. Hats off to Bob Ryan and company, the standard bearers for the Sabol family jewels. The ""The Immaculate Reception"" is a true pastiche of audiovisual footage, first-hand anecdotes, varied opinions and a laughable scientific experiment that is weaved into a tapestry of subtext and body language that has few that rival.",1394496000,,4272,5.368107302533532

8591343,5,B00DBPBP8C,"The series A Football Life could serve as a lifesaver if you have a troubled teen in your life. Especially if you are a single parent. These true life journeys most of them unlikely success stories could inspire both your son, grandson and yourself to overcome whatever obsticles they are dealing with. The stories of the Rams fearsome foursome, Alan Paige who went on to become a state supreme court judge, Earl Campbell whose son's saved their fathers life. Arazona Cardinals coach Bruce Arians fired from over 10 jobs. Great coaches like Lombardi, Shula, Landry, all the greats. If ever there was a series that could save a young man's life this is it! Kurt Warner from grocery store worker to the Super Bowl. Steve Largent too small too slow all the way to the HOF. Chris Carter overcomming the demon of drug addiction. And unfortunately the stars who died far too young with so mkuch talent. Each of the 3 seasons is better than the one before. Straight from the NFL network to you.",1461542400,,987,4.645714285714286
