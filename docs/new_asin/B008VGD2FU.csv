8530888,5,B008VGD2FU,"This film is appealing to an audience of all ages.  However, kids especially would enjoy seeing the lives led by children their own age in a vastly different setting.  Thumbs up to another great film in a series by Elmer Hawkes.",1358035200,,228,4.536585365853658
8530889,5,B008VGD2FU,"East Africa is a beautifully made film, made even better by the musical accompaniment.  The countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda feature vast diversities between modernized cities and primitive villages.  The segment on the beautiful island of Zanzibar is not to be missed.  The film is a delight for young and old alike.",1358035200,,324,5.0754716981132075
8530890,5,B008VGD2FU,Extreme fan of this entire film series! It's a great way to introduce the awareness of other cultures into my daughter's life.,1356048000,,126,4.7727272727272725
8530891,5,B008VGD2FU,"This is the 3rd of Elmer Hawkes's DVD's we have watched and it's another captivating glimpse into another part of the world, that we can only imagine, and we are glad to have indie filmmaker Elmer's window to it on this DVD.  I've enjoyed sharing his videos with other family members and friends, andwe've watched them together.
Last year, our high school had the honor of Elmer visiting us on a PTSA grant.  After the students in World Studies, World Lit, Music and the Film Seminar class saw some of the DVD's, he shared some of his travel experiences with them.  It was amazing to see that they were with him, as he brought back his travel experiences to share with them.",1354752000,,674,4.508196721311475
8530892,5,B008VGD2FU,"After viewing Elmer Hawkes DVD ""West Aftica"" I had to see if he had also done a great job with East Africa. And the unequivocal answer is Yes. Again he expertly mixes beautiful imagery with engaging narration. Highly recommend!",1354752000,,227,4.846153846153846
8530893,5,B008VGD2FU,"Have been fortunate to travel in many places around the globe--not as tourist, but as traveler...this provides the best filmed sense I've seen of what it's like to actually be on the ground in East Africa, because it's primarily intimate authentic (not posed) views of peoples' faces, gestures, activities, clothing, food, etc as they go about their daily lives in a range of urban, village, rural and natural environments...colors and scenes are extremely vibrant, images just keep coming and coming in a very engaging way, beautifully paced, super editing with intermittent appropriate use of excellent music and informative narration.  Hard to imagine how filmmaker is able to film so intimately without triggering self-conscious ""posing"" reactions--don't know how he does it, just glad he does! Highly recommended, looking forward to seeing other films by same filmmaker that are on Amazon.",1354147200,,894,5.431654676258993
8530894,5,B008VGD2FU,"This is a very informative and charming film.  Kids will love it, but so will anyone who is at all interested in travel, adventure and other cultures.  For one thing, it is visually beautiful to watch, plus the kids interviewed were lovely.
Most of all, I had no idea how beautiful and lush parts of this region are.",1353369600,,316,4.431034482758621
