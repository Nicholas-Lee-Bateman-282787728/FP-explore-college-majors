7965194,5,B0000694YZ,"You need the H3D viewing system with the older tube tv (CRT).  These 3 films and about 15 others are filmed with the ""field sequential"" camera system.  The 3D will NOT work on any HDTV with it's paired glasses that comes with all 3D HD TV'S.  These were made either by Slingshot or Razor brand DVD companies.  They also made 3 IMAX films, Haunted Castle, Alien Adventure, and  Encounters in the Third Dimension.  The other of these, which all or most have the 2D version as well are Hunting Season, Blood Tease, Blood Sisters, Evil Unleashed:The Mummy, Camp Blood, Camp Blood 2, Eyes of the Werewolf, Zombie Chronicles(which was released by 2 different companies).  The 1940 serial Flash Gordon may be in this group.  Yesterday I read a review on this and he says it works with the red/cyan glasses, it's selling online for $4 and free shipping from England, how about that!  I believe there are At Least 3 others filmed in this H3D(field sequential) system.  The good news 10 of these films are available on double feature Blu Ray from Ultimate 3D Heaven.com, which I found out on August 2 for $9.95 per 2 pack.  I hope this clears up most of the confusion because most people and a couple of companies just say ""3D"".  You can also check I-glasses,com for the system and glasses.  I learned the hard way after buying most of these and did buy this Ultimate 3D system which does come with 3 of these films.  Good Luck.",1407110400,,1418,4.531496062992126
7965195,1,B0000694YZ,this product is garbage it dosnt work. your better off buying the red and blue glasses and watching normal television you will get better affects. wish i could return it but i took to long to try it out. don't buy this item its garbage,1235174400,,235,4.2444444444444445
7965196,4,B0000694YZ,"Okay, so the included movies couldn't be more terrible even if they had help (which it's clear they didn't).

  BUT:

the 3-D itself was wonderful. The system is fabulous, and it's so easy to set it up, a trained monkey (without the training, mind you) could do it in 2-3 minutes at the most.

Images leap off the screen at you, I found myself ducking more than once to avoid being struck by different items. I tested it out on the Haunted Castle movie, and though the movie was terribly cheesy, the graphics and the 3-D imaging was incredible. We love it. Next step is to get the wireless glasses, so we aren't tripping over each other trying to get away from the images on the screen.

A WORD OF CAUTION:
I don't know really if it was just the television I initially hooked the system up to (I have a 37"" Sharp Aquos in my living room), but the system didn't work there. I hooked it up to the standard 27"" Magnavox I have in my bedroom, and it works great. It could have just been me, and the way I connected it originally, but I did follow the very simple installation instructions... Just thought I'd point that out for anyone else looking that has a LCD/HDTV...",1208131200,5,1166,4.325688073394495
7965197,1,B0000694YZ,"THE ULTIMATE 3-D HORROR COLLECTION

Aspect ratio: 1.33:1
Soundtrack: Mono

CAMP BLOOD (USA - 1999): Whilst hiking in woodland near the deserted Camp Blackwood - site of an unsolved murder ten years earlier - four young city-dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide (Courtney Harris) and stalks them through the woods with murderous intent...

HUNTING SEASON (USA - 2000): A woman (Cindy Pena) arms herself with an arsenal of lethal weapons and heads into the woods to take revenge against four masked hunters who beat her boyfriend (Michael Walker) to a bloody pulp and subjected her to a brutal sexual assault.

THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (USA - 2001): Whilst searching for an isolated town with a history of strange occurrences, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies which are reputed to haunt the area.

Billed as 'campy, horror-filled fun', the three movies which make up Slingshot Entertainment's 'Ultimate 3-D Horror Collection' were filmed on camcorder utilizing the Nu-View field sequential 3-D format, with no attempt to disguise their microscopic budgets or their origins as bona fide video productions. In a word, they're dreadful. In interviews, Brad Sykes - director of CAMP BLOOD and THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES - cites the early works of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as key influences on his career, but while those filmmakers used their lack of adequate funding to challenge the mainstream with cutting-edge works which substituted imagination and energy for glossy aesthetics, Sykes and his cohorts have used video technology merely to imitate their cinematic counterparts, resulting in (literal) home movies with delusions of grandeur...

CAMP BLOOD has the strongest narrative, but Sykes' script adheres closely to an established blueprint (with obvious nods to the likes of FRIDAY THE 13th, THE BURNING and THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, which the director readily acknowledges) without adding anything even remotely new or interesting to the formula. THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES is a complete waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role, and the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction. HUNTING SEASON - directed by Jeff Leroy (editor on all three productions) - is marginally superior, featuring a spirited performance by Amazonian beauty Pena as the vengeful, leather-clad harpy seeking revenge on four irredeemable slimeballs, leading to a genuine twist in the tale. However, while Leroy's direction is lively and competent (including a fair number of off-the-screen 3-D effects), the rock-bottom production values and unflattering camcorder photography conspire against any and all good intentions. These aren't 'fun' movies in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); they are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

And yet, this release amounts to a dual-edged sword: The movies are packaged here with a video transmitter and wired glasses - almost twice as expensive if purchased separately - which allows viewers to experience 3-D movies in the field sequential format, and Slingshot has sensibly included both 3-D AND 2-D versions of the films on each disc. Whereas anaglyphic presentations (using red-blue glasses) tend to distort colors and obscure dimensional effects, the field sequential process (polarized glasses) offers a near-perfect reproduction of 3-D images, preserving all the color and resolution inherent in the material. Some flicker is evident during brightly-lit sequences, but this is reduced markedly when viewed in a darkened room (ideally, the lights should be turned off altogether). However, while all of the titles under discussion generate an extraordinary illusion of depth (particularly HUNTING SEASON, which features a number of eye-popping landscape shots), the visuals are often afflicted by crosstalk (that is, left-eye images retain residual imagery from right-eye images and vice versa, leading to ghosting and eye-strain), and the image flattens out whenever the filmmakers resort to slow motion or speeded-up action. Often, background details are reduced to an indistinct blur which defy all attempts to resolve them into a dimensional image, and foreground details (grass, hanging branches, etc.) are often similarly unfocussed. However, these problems are not insurmountable, and the field sequential format is tailor-made for the reproduction on DVD of any 3-D movie photographed with truly professional polarizing equipment (HOUSE OF WAX, FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN, etc.).

Sadly, while 'The Ultimate 3-D Horror Collection' keeps the field sequential process in the public eye and paves the way for GENUINE 3-D movies on DVD (with 'flat' and 3-D versions on the same disc), the technology is tainted by association with this kind of direct-to-video garbage, thereby hindering its acceptance within the mainstream.",1067904000,38,5297,5.498771498771498
7965198,4,B0000694YZ,"Think of the price as paying for the system and glasses which work quite well and the DVDs as free bonuses, and you'll be OK. The flicks are all camcorder stuff with some interest but overall, don't expect too much. Use the glasses and seek out other, real 3-D movies from other sources.",1043193600,19,287,4.433962264150943
7965199,1,B0000694YZ,"I recently bought this Ultimate 3D horror collection.  I already have the Ultimate 3D Imax collection which is excellent.  However the Horror collection was a complete disappointment.  I think they must have had a budget of about [$] (and that is for all three films).  The acting is apalling and the entire films looks as though they was filmed with a couple of cheap camcorders with the Nu-View system attached.  The 3D effects are iffy at best.  If you're choosing between this and the IMAX 3D package then DEFINITELY go with IMAX.  I just wish, being a big fan of 3D films, that the big hollywood studios would take note that there is a lot of demand for 3D DVDs, and re-release all their big production 3D movies of past years in field sequential format on DVD.  Maybe someday!",1033948800,14,782,4.575539568345324
7965200,3,B0000694YZ,"I must admit that I am an older viewer and remember when 3-D movies were the craze. I saw ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" as well as ""Friday the 13th part 3 in 3-D"". The films in this box set are nothing more than a showcase for the 3-D viewing system. This is not a bad thing a the 3-D is generally of good quality. The instruction manual pertaining to the 3-D set up is good and no one should have a problem. My only complaint is that it still is not a true 3-D system as the scenes are often clouded by improper camera angles or lighting. One will often experience double vision or massive ""flickering"" due to the 3-D effect. As the technology is not in place, this is a forgivable aspect as the effects that do come off are astounding. The three films presented are a much different matter. They are of the horrendously low budget variety and without merit, their only purpose is to illuminate three dimensional effects. I would recommend that only those intersted in 3-D bother with this collection.",1033689600,22,1005,4.437837837837838
