  Why?  I think because they caught the  silliness of that Southern California bourgeois with Jewish overlay world  very well.  half the fun was watching Woody Allen's expressions.
  I  also though the damn mime scene was painfully funny!",942451200,13,408,4.797101449275362

425455,4,630212381X,"But would you expect less from this cast?  It's  a fun  film for this time of year. Laughter and expected humor are not under  done and some may think it's too predictable. I though it was just right.

This is what can happen when you cheat and then try to ease your conscience. A sixteen year marriage goes on the skids when both husband and wife confess infidelity.  Woody Allen plays himself again. Bette Middler is brilliant as a published psychiatrist whoes patient's interrupt her life in the most inconvenient times.

425513,3,630212381X,"This film spent about a week in the theatres and tanked with the critics. Out of curiosity, just to see exactly how bad it was, I watched it on television. Citizen Kane it ain't, but I ended up really enjoying it!  Woody Allen and Bette Midler had terrific chemistry and were quite sexy together (!?).  I can't wait to post this so that I can have a look at other reviews to see if I'm out of my mind and am the only one that liked it. (Typically, in order not to be influenced, I won't look at other reviews until I post.)",1353283200,,523,4.067961165048544
425514,3,630212381X,"I'm a Woody Allen fan. I've seen most of his movies and have enjoyed most (but not all) of them. I found this movie amusing but falling a bit short of his better work. His character in this movie, in my opinion, does not engage the sympathy of the viewer at the same level as characters he has successfully created in the past. This is not to say he doesn't do a good job with it, it's just to say he didn't ""reach"" me in this character as he has previously.

Bette Midler was absolutely perfect in the role of his all-too-human, far-less-than-perfect wife. (I'm not necessarily a Midler fan, but kudos to her in this role. Great job, Bette.)

Still, I would certainly recommend this film for the purpose of killing a couple of hours of otherwise available time. It's not going to educate or elevate you, it will not ask you to re-evaluate your life, but you will chuckle . . . and, sometimes, that's quite enough. It's a pleasantly diverting bit of fluff.",1348704000,3,956,4.426136363636363
425515,3,630212381X,"Blu-Ray. We saw this some time ago, and while not a ""Woody Allen"" movie, he was in it. This is one of those movies that isn't really bad, nor really good - just inbetween, and we wouldn't have bought it except for the fact it was on Blu-Ray and only $4. Quality is similar to what you might see on a DVD playing in an upscaled DVD player.",1345507200,,338,3.985294117647059
425516,5,630212381X,"This is one of my all time favorite Woody Allen movies.  But I think it's the kind of movie you will either love or hate - nothing in between!  I am a big Woody Allen fan, but do not like a lot of his movies, so considering how picky I am, that says a lot.  My favorite movies of his have been Play It Again Sam, Annie Hall, Manhattan, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Zelig, New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and probably a few others I forgot.  Least favorite (many!) but the worst ever was Curse of the Jade Scorpion...  Anyway, if you like ""Jewish-ness"" you will like this film, I think it's a real sleeper!",1327449600,7,637,4.319327731092437
425517,3,630212381X,"My review is more about the Blu-Ray disc itself, more than the movie..which I do like, but it could of been much better.
I realize you get what you pay for, and this bargain Blu-Ray disc suffers from some major flaws..
1. The film was transferred in 1080i instead of the better 1080p. The image though a noticeable upgrade from the DVD disc from years ago, the colors are a tad less than expected for Hi-Def, and also it's loaded with digital enhancement, such as edge enhancement. You can tell this is most likely from the original DVD master, but as I said a noticeable improvement over the DVD.
This however isn't the major problem, the major problem is...
2. The DTS Master Audio 2.0 track, which is a surprise as the box lists the audio as a plain Dolby Digital track. Unfortunately, the the volume is so low on this track, I had to raise it up 60, when I usually always have my amp between 22 to 35 depending on time of day. I don't care if it's a cheap disc or not there is no excuse for this error. Other than that I like this movie, and matter of fact liked it more now than back when it first was released theatrically.
Just which the picture was 1080p and sound was recorded at a normal level.. yes it's under $5 and wasn't expecting a big remaster.. but i did expect to at least hear the film.",1323993600,3,1305,4.244979919678715
425518,5,630212381X,"Bette Midler and Woody Allen are hilarious in this satirical comedy! Woody Allen's character, Nick, is married to author Deborah, played by Midler. After years of a happy marriage, Nick reveals to her he's had an affair. Deborah is shocked and requests a divorce, but later admits she herself has been unfaithful.

How about a little trivia! Most of the film's mall scenes were filmed on a sound stage in Queens, New York. It was a two-level set nearly a quarter mile long with over 150 fully stocked stores. Scenes with elevators and escalators were filmed at a real mall in Stamford, Connecticut. Some exterior shots where filmed at the actual Beverly Center Mall in Los Angeles.

425543,1,630212381X,"I didn't realize that Woody Allen did not direct this film until after I watched it.  This explains much of my confusion. Depressing, monotonous, painful to watch.  This film  does nothing but depress the viewer. The early 90's fashions and musical bits did not help make this a ""timeless"" film either. The annoying ""carolers"" throughout the film.....on and on.  The one redeaming feature was the reference to ""Salaam Bombay"".  My wife was ready to shut it off but I had to see how it ended......oh well, no surprise.  We all have to live with ""dukkha"" but this just rubs it in your face.  It's an irritating film.",1258243200,2,614,4.682242990654205
425544,1,630212381X,"Woody, Woody my funny, quirky, nerdy Woody Allen what the heck are you doing within one hundred miles of a shopping mall. In L.A. no less. Get back to New York on the fastest means of transportation possible even if you have to hitch hike. Bette Midler can do shopping malls, with Richard Drefuss maybe, but not with Woody. By the way if one really watches what goes on in the average shopping mall one would realize that there is no time for marriage counselling, serious dinner and dancing or movie theather sex or any other kind of self-help therapy as portayed here. Or any inclination to do such things. The deal is shop until you drop. Tunnel vision is the required virtue here. If you want to see Woody where he lives watch the films Manhattan or Annie Hall. If you want to watch Bette where she lives watch Down and Out in Beverly Hills or The Rose. Don't watch this one.",1224806400,,879,4.398773006134969
425545,3,630212381X,"This film is about a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary at a Los Angeles shopping mall. The celebration is bittersweet because the husband(Woody Allen) admits his affair to his wife(Bette Midler). The wife remains angry for a while but eventually forgives her husband. Allen and Midler have done better films than this. Midler's much better films include DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS,RUTHLESS PEOPLE and BIG BUSINESS(all made by Buena Vista like this one). Allen's subsequent film MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY from 1993 was much better than this.",1085184000,12,553,5.367816091954023
425546,3,630212381X,"I am not a Woody Allen fan. His neurotic persona never appealed to me. I watched this movie because I like Bette Midler. This film makes the viewer feel like a mensch schlep (third wheel, tag-a-long) who went to the mall with them, & has to suffer through their angst, make-ups, yelling matches, etc. because you need a ride home. In between the couple's dysfunction a lame mime is tossed in to try & add some comic relief. This movie could have been so much more.",1082764800,4,464,4.406976744186046
425547,1,630212381X,"Three cheers and an unlimited mall shopping gift certificate to whomever can sit though this stale, bland, virtually humorless, endless piece of crap. Could the dialogue be any duller? Could the 2 stars be more mismatched? I live near one of the 2 malls used for filming and even that tiny tidbit couldn't get me through this tedious mess. Could either of them have had any idea as to what they were in for? I hope this is a product of bad editing and writing since I want to give Woody and Bette a fair shake for trying hard.
Go to the mall on the busiest day of the year for more laughs and insight.",1069459200,5,601,4.234782608695652
425548,2,630212381X,Bette Midler and Woody Allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing. Instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as Bette and Woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school. They also discover that they have been cheating on one another. The movie gets boring rather fast as Bette and Woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters. I would have expected better from these two.,1029801600,2,531,4.484536082474227
425549,5,630212381X,"Lets talk Scenes from a Mall. Starring Woody Allen and Bette Midler in this smart, talky, funny, challenging, heatwarming, sad, tear jerking, Christmas holiday fun! Nothing in this film is wrong except maybe the length, which in my opinion, could be extended some what with more laughs.
Starting out at home, leaving the kids to go on a holiday skiing trip, on their sixteenth aniversary they prepare for an all day Christmas shopping spree at the local mall. When they get there they are already confronted with the zany antics of a mime (played well by Bill Irwin from the GRINCH). They exchange aniversary gifts and then extramarital revelations. With this we see an aray of different emotional acts... crying, screaming, hitting, throwing, talking, etc etc. It all changes in a second, very unexpectedly. That is one of things that makes this movie so good, is that everything is so unexpected. Scenes from a Mall is very unpredictable. With beautiful holiday sequences, sharp laughs, very dry humor, happy thoughts of the past, SFAM will not let you down! Including the awesome adaptions of ""You Do Something to Me"" by Marc Shaiman and an unmatchable vocal by Marlene Dietrich. Thank you Paul Mazursky for giving me a favorite movie, SCENES FROM A MALL is just that.",976924800,17,1271,4.916279069767442

425551,3,630212381X,"Yes, it's hard to believe that 'nervous' Woody Allen and 'brassy' Bette Middler would ever tie the knot but their characters have done here - to consistent comic effect! They play a yuppie couple who spend a day at an  L.A mall preparing for their anniversary celebration. What works here is  how quickly the tone of the couples relationship changes when either party  reveal a secret. One minute it's ""I adore you"" and the next  ""I hope you die in hell!"". There are plenty of laughs here and  both stars are in top form. It's not a comedy with much depth or insight  like Bette's ""Beaches"" or Woody's ""Manhattan"" but it  scores well in a mainstream movies most important category -  entertainment!",954115200,6,698,4.663934426229508
