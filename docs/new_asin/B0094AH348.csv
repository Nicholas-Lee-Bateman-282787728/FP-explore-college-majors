8535712,5,B0094AH348,"The caption on the DVD sleeve reads This Is how Verdi should  be played! and I could not agree more. The trio of principals: Ribeiro,  Lungu, and Dalla Benetta , offer youthful exhuberance and intensity, good looks and glorious voices.  The rest of the cast is equally good.  Superb conductor,  traditional production, great staging.  Anf of course, Verdis exquisite music. It has renovated my faith in the totality of the Verdi canon, not only its most performed titles.",1435449600,4,471,4.9743589743589745
8535713,4,B0094AH348,"The soprano who plays the role of Medora,  Irina Lungu, a beautiful young woman, sings with a slow vibrato on her higher notes, which is difficult for me to listen to.  The other three singers in principal roles, Bruno Ribeiro, Luca Salsi, and Silvia Dalla Benetta, are great singing actors with great voices, and it's on the strength of their performances that I give this DVD 4 stars.  I've already watched it a number of times.",1404259200,3,430,4.631578947368421
8535714,4,B0094AH348,"Verdi didn't like this opera much, and it is not on the level of his many masterworks, but...although formulaic the music does make its effect, and the cast, although not on the level of the Caballe, Norman, Carreras recording for Phillips, does very nicely",1389052800,3,257,4.863636363636363
8535715,1,B0094AH348,"If I am not happy with a production or opera, I never write a critique, as I never like to give bad vibes.
BUT!! in this case I must. It is this sort of production that is enough to turn any prospective opera goer off opera for life.
It can be summed up in three phrases:
1. Verdi should have never written it.
2. Teatro di Parma should never have produced it.
3. And C Major should never have recorded it
For starters the orchestra is extremely thin in sound and the singers are just passable.
The staging is so, so.  The Harem scene is extremely embarrassing both for those watching and for the women in it. Their singing is so weak you can hardly hear them. And it is quite clear the director did not know what to do with them. At one point I thought it was going to turn into a lesbian romp. That's how bad it was.
As much as I LOVE Verdi, I do think that this is his weakest work. The plot/libretto is ridiculous and the music is not up to the remainder of his works.
Save your money and move onto his more lustrous operas.
If you must have it for your collection, buy the CD version with Caballe, Carreras, J. Norman and Gardelli (1990) on Philips.",1384128000,4,1154,4.151785714285714
8535716,4,B0094AH348,"Il Corsaro is the step-child in the Verdi canon of operas. I was completed to fulfill a contract obligation to the publisher Lucca who was about to sue Verdi for not fulfilling a contract previously agreed to. There were angry words exchanged. After receiving it Lucca farmed it out to a back-water opera house in Trieste. Verdi did not attend the premiere and the audience did not like the opera. Thereafter it had only a few performances and disappeared from view.
Even the Tutto Verdi series from the Teatro Regio di Parma produced this opera on the tiny stage of the Teatro Verdi in Busseto Verdi's home town. The theatre in Parma has a capacity of 1200 but in Busseto it's only 300 and the stage is miniscule. And who sang the roles? All newcomers to the operatic stage but on the whole they did quite well. And of course the downsized orchestra and chorus of Parma did very well.
The Corrado (Conrad in Byron's long long narrative poem) of Bruno Ribiero was quite exciting. He is young, handsome and looks like he could led a group of pirates and have a couple of women falling all over him. His tenor is pretty much a heroic type as of now, it is deep rich and powerful up and down the scale; there are some rough edges that will smooth out in time. The roll of Seid calls for a big bodied crusher of lesser men with a voice that carries to the next few buildings. We have it in the person of Luca Salsi. He certainly has the makings of a good Verdi baritone. He roughed-up some of the lyrics but with more vocal work he will smooth things out.  The ladies of this opera were of a mixed bag. Irina Lungu has a rasp in her upper register and it is quite unpleasant; her mid-range is fine for the part of the long suffering Medora.  The star of the show is supposed to be Gulnara and she certainly was. Silvia Dalla Benetta executed her passage work very well; trills, runs and declamation all of a piece. She has a good career ahead of her.
In English lit. class I remember reading much of Byron. The Corsair was one of them. I also remember he does go on and on. I didn't find the story interesting then, nor do I now. I agree and disagree as usual with my colleague reviewer John Gleeson. But I agree that even lesser Verdi is better than the best of most composers of the time e.g Pacini. It is interesting that the third act written in 1846 when Verdi was enthused about the story is better than Acts 1 & 2 written in 1848 when he given up on Corsaro but needed to fulfill has contract for Lucca. But even in these two acts there a some fine moments to be savored. For example the cabaletta of Gulnare ""Ah conforto e sola  speme"" which as pointed out by reviewer John Gleeson is very fine music. So the work is a mixed bag. I'm glad to have a fine recording and will listen to it now and then.",1379376000,5,2803,4.25515947467167
8535717,3,B0094AH348,"Unfortunately, Il Corsaro will never be a great opera - no matter how you slice it. However, the present DVD somehow manages to outshine the 2004 version with a superannuated Renato Bruson.
The voices are actually quite good throughout; Ribeiro is handsome and a delight to look at and I do agree with my predecessor that he is a singer to watch.
If you have never seen this opera and would like to complete your Verdi collection, I should definitely say: go for it.  If it is a great great Verdi opera you want, you have been warned.",1378425600,9,534,4.448979591836735
8535718,5,B0094AH348,This performance was so enjoyable. All the singers were new to me. Young and fresh voices. Ribeiro is a find. He has the total package. I will be looking for more of him in the future. It was so nice to see a performance that was set in the period that Verdi wrote. Yet it had touches here and there that would make it interesting to those who wish for something more than the usual. I would recommend this to everyone!,1375574400,4,419,4.185185185185185
8535719,5,B0094AH348,"Ah, gentle reader, what can one say about Il Corsaro? That it, along with Alzira are considered the bottom of the Verdi barrel? That, as Wiliam Berger (""Verdi With a Vengeance"") notes, ""If one could assemble the proper cast to perform Corsaro properly, one wouldn't. One would produce Trovatore instead""? Perhaps, but Verdi at his least best is still mighty fine music, and this performance is convincing evidence that Corsaro is worth experiencing.

This disc presents four principal singers with whom I am totally unfamiliar, but I hope to hear more from them. (If the opera gods are just, we should, but experience shows them to be as capricious as were their Greek anticedents, else why no more Met HD DVDs? But I am off topic ...)

The tenor role of Corrado has been described (Berger) as written for a ""heroic voice"". To me, Bruno Ribeiro is more of a spinto, but he executes the role, with all its fiendish tessatura, flawlessly. He would be an ideal Alfredo or Duke of Mantua. Bravo!

Irina Lungu (Medora) is a gifted soprano. Her role requires her to sing a bit low in the soprano range but when it's time to hit the high notes, she delivers perfectly. What acting is required in this romantic role (aside from fainting and dying) is well done. Brava!!

Silvia Dalla Benetta (as I noted in my review of the Tutto Verdi sampler) is the real deal. Her role requires the ""blood and guts"" approach, especially as to her Act II cabaletta, which Budden refers to as ordinary, as I recall, but Osborne calls it ""absolutely glorious"" (go figure). I think it rocks because Mme Dalla Benetta nails it! Brava!!!

Baritone Luca Salsi (Seid) is the almost bad guy. His singing in a performance where everyone is spot on, nealy steals the show. What a voice! And a kind of passionate intensity in the dramatic aspects as well. Whew!

Chorus and orchestra do a first rate job, too. Staging is traditional and surprisingly effective, considering the small stage.

Disc quality is nearly perfect, my only reservation being that the women's chorus seemed under miked in the second act. But that aside, the surround experience of C Major's DTS is dramatic.

A word about the venue: this opera was performed in the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto. The theatre is tiny, having a stage about the size of a two car garage and seating for 300. The audience was enthusiastic, but remember, gentle reader, that Busetto was Verdi's home town, and it, along with nearby Parma have a serious history of doing bad things to performers who disappoint. Caruso was reported to have been booed in a performance of L'Elisir and subsequently refused service by a cab driver who didn't want to dirty his cab with a bad singer. Othe disappointees have been refused service in restaurants and hotels. So an enthusiatic audience, which this one was, really says something about the performance.

I share that reaction. Buy with confidence, and forget all about that German guy.",1362787200,7,2947,4.774066797642436
8535720,5,B0094AH348,"This was shot over two performances in Busseto, in October 2008. Teatro Verdi in Busseto is a small but beautiful building inside the Pallavicino castle. This staging was captured on a Dynamic DVD when it played in Parma in 2004. It's a simple, traditional and beautiful staging that was scaled down for Busseto from Parma's much larger house (1200 seats in Parma vs. Busseto's 300). They could fit only 27 Parma orchestra players into the Busseto pit.

Director Lamberto Puggelli's staging employs a dramatically effective system to outline the action and convey a sense of time and space. The single set is a deck of a ship with sails, ropes and masts going up and down for scene changes. Costumes are rich and colorful. There is a thrilling battle scene between the pirates and the Turks. The staging and lighting are replete with wonderful and ingenious touches.

The four leads were relatively young and unknown singers at the time. They are all very good in every aspect, three are superb. The Parma choir, prepared by Martin Faggiani is as always first rate. Video direction by Tiziano Mancini is on the same high level of his work in Parma. The sound is fantastic. The PCM stereo track gives you the perspective of a seat deep in the house with some hall resonance. I have only a stereo setup and I played the DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio surround sound track accidentally. I don't know what my stereo setup does with this track (a stereo mix-down or just the front speakers?) but what I heard was very intriguing. The perspective is from a front row seat, no hall resonance, but what surprised me was the realistic sense of presence. The singers were located in a three dimensional vocal space very clearly and there was something in the sound that was very natural, lighter and more pleasant on the ears. The orchestra had that distinctive sound coming from a pit - this is very rarely captured; it's quite special. I ended up choosing the surround track, something I have never done before. I would be curious to hear from someone with a surround setup how it compares with the stereo.

Overall this production is a pleasure to experience from start to finish, a real gem.",1359417600,12,2178,4.711286089238845
