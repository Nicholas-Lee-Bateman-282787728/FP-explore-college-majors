2778146,5,B000NQRE9Q,this will no doubt be a great set on blu-ray but shouldn't they wait until the 4th Indy Jones comes out?,1174953600,8,104,4.0
2778177,4,B000NQRE9Q,"The four Indiana Jones movies starring Harrison Ford together.  The first, Raiders of the Lost Ark, is a classic, with its nods at the old cliffhanger serials of the twenties and thirties.  The second one, well, its Spielberg's dark side coming out.  The opening scene in the cabaret being the only good part of the movie.  The third gave us Sean Connery as Ford's father, and a return to the humor and Nazi bashing that we loved in the first.  And then there is the fourth which quite frankly is a rehash of chase scenes, with incredible aliens and Commies as the bad guys.
On the whole this is an uneven series, and if just the first and third would be a certifiable 5 star, but the third drags the series down and the fourth is just for those who want to see Ford in the role just one more time.",1524268800,,798,4.258278145695364
2778178,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This is one of my favorite trilogies of all time!  I never get tired of it.  I remember watching the Back to the Future films recently and I found myself drifting into boredom.  I didn't hold up that well to me, but Indiana Jones on the other hand never gets old.  I absolutely love this trilogy and wish they made more.  Love the ambiance, the location backdrop, the action, the adventure, the drama, the acting.  This is a thrilling ride.  Was so excited to buy this boxset when it came out.",1524268800,,493,4.351648351648351

Wrong!

Well, when I had the opportunity to get this complete pack on BluRay for $25.99, I could not resist.  All four for this outatanding price?! You bet.  And boy, am I glad I did.

On Bluray this quadrilogy is a whole new experience.  The awesome sound and the crisp, colorful clarity of the movies gave me an opportunity to revisit these adventures with new eyes.  With the vivid clarity, the dated special effects in Temple of Doom are really noticable, but it simply adds to the movie's charm in my opinion.  It is still my favorite tale of the four.

Go, go, go Dr. Jones!

2778335,5,B000NQRE9Q,"It was great to see the Indiana Jones series once again -- although the final one in the series (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) is not -- to my mind -- in the same class as the earlier films. The quality of the transfers is excellent. Harrison Ford is great fun to watch, and he is teamed with a great supporting cast in all cases. The films inhabit that wonderful space between being an homage to adventure film serials of the 1940s and '50s, and being over-the-top tongue-in-cheek. Harrison Ford manages to carry off that blend with incredible zest and energy.",1506988800,,583,4.561904761904762

The movies are relatively clean and suitable for family viewing... except for young kids that ight be scared at a few scenes, especially in Temple of Doom.

Overall I think this set is a great value.

2778371,3,B000NQRE9Q,"First and foremost, Indiana Jones is a must have for any movie collection. The movies are hands down 5 out of 5 stars.

So why did I give it a 3 you ask. Well I'll tell you why: The packaging. The packaging and case look great. Seriously it is gorgeous. HOWEVER, there is a problem when the case causes damage to the actual main material inside.

The discs don't come on a plastic press down, lift off normal kind of mechanism that you find in 99% of any kind of CD, DVD or Bluray case. All of these movies are in a slip cover. You have to slide it out from the side to get it out. Even this wouldn't be sooo terrible if I didn't have to really fight to get the discs out; the discs are in so tight that I felt like I had done a workout at the gym. Ok, maybe that's a bit of exaggeration but seriously, they are in tight. This causes friction between the delicate disc and the harsh paper the discs sit on. The first time I pulled out each disc, they all had scratches on them. No, they weren't extremely huge scratches, but they were scratches nonetheless. And maybe I'm the only one like this but, I like my movies to be flawless; NO fingerprints NO scratches. I had to put fingerprints on them to get them out but at least that's an easy fix but scratches are permanent. And not to mention I haven't even looked at them yet. I don't want scratches on my NEW material literally straight out the box. Also, after sliding these things out over and over again, over time the case is just killing my movies. Terrible, HORRIBLE design.

Ok, I feel like you may get my point by now. To wrap this up, this is a great buy to have the whole Harrison Ford Indy collection. But be prepared that if you buy this specific set and scratches annoy you, you will be highly annoyed. I plan to put these in some other slim cases because I can't bear to see my Indy's take damage for no good reason at all.",1498262400,20,1889,4.141689373297003

It looks fantastic in high definition and feels more like the previous three films. The scenes filmed in downtown New Haven, Connecticut in and around Yale University are brilliant. The Essex steam railway in Connecticut was also used. As for the over abundance of CG effects, they play much better in Blu-ray. I was very pleased with this set and highly recommend it.

It is amazing how long KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL took to get to the big screen when one thinks about it. It has been nine years now and I think time has done it well making this film feel part of the series.",1491004800,,698,4.5396825396825395

2778519,1,B000NQRE9Q,"The picture quality of ""Raiders"" is very clear, but much too bright all the way through!  The whole film looks overexposed!  The jungle in Peru is too bright with almost no shadows, and the sky is washed out.  The inside of the temple is not dark and creepy anymore; it looks entirely lit by sunlight!  The Golden Idle is no longer gold because the reflections on it are so bright that they wash out all color and clarity.  The scenery outside the window of Dr. Jones's classroom is too bright and all washed out as well; you can hardly make out the buildings outside.  In the plane boarding scene both the sky and the white of the Pan Am Jet are washed out, and it's hard to see the Nazi Agent boarding because the scene is, again, too bright!  These are just a few examples (they go on and on throughout the film) of how this movie has gotten a very poor transfer (in my opinion) to Blu Ray.

I'm disappointed with the audio too!  Just a couple of examples:  you can't hear all three distinct pings of the table knife hitting the tent floor when Toht knocks it from Marion's hand, and you can't hear Katanga's sailors cheer as Indy climbs aboard the submarine.  Quite a few of the sound effects that I always look forward to are either too faint, muffled, or gone!

I haven't even watched the other three movies.  Why bother?  If one is flawed, the whole set is spoiled!

And, what is with the packaging?  The discs are so tightly crammed into these cardboard sleeves or ""pages"" of a book which the packaging is supposed to simulate, that it's a very delicate chore to get them out or back in without possibly scratching or fingering them!

I'm going back to DVD because that is absolutely the best quality copy of this saga available!",1473120000,3,1737,4.411949685534591

2778649,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Admittedly I`m not a fan of what Lucas and Spielberg did with the other Indiana Jones films. Last Crusade is watchable for Sean Connery but its just a lame rehash of Raiders of the lost ark. The
other 2 are absolutely awful. If Temple of Doom didn`t have the incredibly annoying blonde hair girl and kid and
had a consistantly dark tone like the
terrific heart scene it could have been one fantastic Indiana Jones movie. Unfortunately thats not the case. Now, on to the incredibly amazing film
that is Raiders of the lost ark. This is my favorite movie of all time. It is non stop thrills and adventure, expertly made and a landmark motion picture. I`ve known
quite a few people who love the sequels but never even heard of Raiders for some extremely bizarre reason. If you are one of these people you need to stop
reading this and watch it right this instant and prepare to be blown away. There is not another movie out there like Raiders of the lost ark. I was fortunate
enough to catch a special showing of this amazing classic in the theater a couple years ago and it was one of the best experiences I`ve ever had. I`ve
seen this movie atleast 200 times and I will never get tired of it. I repeat if you`ve never seen Raiders of the lost ark stop what you are doing, leave work if you have to and buy this collection for that
movie alone. It`s also sold seperately but there are alot of great extras on the collection. Now if you`ll excuse me I`m going to watch Raiders of the lost ark.",1463616000,,1490,4.325

Rating: It's definitely worth buying on blu-ray. (Audience grabs their popcorn and enjoys every second of it.)

Grab your fedoras and your family. This is one of the reasons, why we love movies. The overwhelming response is an enjoyable one. There's almost everything you could ever want in one movie. I know there are some moments that you wouldn't let a 3 year old child see, for obvious reasons. This is a product of sure genius. This movie deserves applause. Its a classic case, of art imitates life. Enjoy it. This is meant to be kept for generations to enjoy.

That said, be aware the packaging, which contains the 4 Blu-ray movie discs and a bonus features disc, has design and/or manufacturing ""issues"", at least in my case. #1 - it is difficult to get discs of the tight sleeves. #2 - it is even MORE difficult to get the discs pushed back in, due to the construction of the package with a cardboard lip inside the tight sleeve. In addition to being frustrating and time-consuming, there may be a risk of slight scratches around the first 1/2 "" of the disc due to the cardboard lip. Thankfully, Blu-rays are pretty scratch resistant.",1450828800,23,692,4.57258064516129

I did watch the 3 movies and they are very nicely remastered. It is not on par with a real BR movie made nowadays, for obvious limitations in the technology (the source material has been heavily processed to improve it), but it is really good, far beyond the DVD version, so highly suggested.

There is also an interesting disk with extras, which add to the package value.

Keep in mind that the movies has in some case, a loss of focus...probably an effect of the post processing, but in some scene you can clearly see the blur, where the whole image goes out of focus while the background goes in focus; this is mildy annoying but it last very little...I think to remember only the scene in Venice on the boat, in the third movie, and the scene in the tombs with the snakes in the first movie.",1448236800,,929,4.485207100591716

VIDEO QUALITY:

Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)
Score: 4.5/5

Replace the original production year of 1981 with 2012, show the Blu-ray, and those not in-the-know would not be any the wiser. Raiders of the Lost Ark looks like a brand-new movie. The frame-by-frame restoration is nothing short of a minor miracle for film fans and, if there was ever a list compiled of movies deserving -- demanding, even -- of the purest, most precise restoration possible, Raiders would be amongst them. The restoration, and its presentation on Blu-ray, does wonders for the film. Those who grew up watching it on television or on VHS in particular will be in for a treat, and even fans who purchased the DVD trilogy set from a few years back will instantly recognize the gargantuan improvement in picture quality. The movie plays even better with a clear, well-defined picture. Seeing it big and seeing it with this much attention to detail and with such a pure film-like picture quality is nearly akin to seeing it for the first time. The movie begins with arguably its weakest visual sequence. The adventurers traverse through dense jungle defined by bright green foliage and dark, sometimes overwhelmingly so, shadows. Blacks fluctuate a bit, appearing a bit too overpowering in some places and a touch too gray in others, but the push towards either side is minimal. Low-light detail isn't extraordinary, but the image is crisp and accurate, despite some soft-focus shots. Errant noise is introduced into a few shots. The cave interior offers some fabulous textures as seen on stone floors and walls, natural woods, and the crisp lines of the idol itself. The subsequent chase scene -- Indy running from the Hovitos -- reveals the film's brightest and most well-defined shots yet; the clarity and colors dazzle, and the crispness and definition of grasses, leaves, and even the plane will startle longtime viewers. The following stateside classroom scenes offer naturally warm and well-defined woods and a stability and evenness to the image that breathes new life into the film's calmest stretch and one of its most critical establishing sections.

It's when the movie begins its second act and the action shifts to Cairo that things truly begin to dazzle. The transfer is at its absolute demo-worthy best as Indy runs through the city, trying to rescue Marion before she's placed in the truck packed with explosives. The intricate detailing on the earthen colored faades, the sandy terrain, the wicker baskets, and the dusty clothes is nothing short of mesmerizing. Every last finite element is brought to dazzling life with the sort of clarity and perfect resolution usually reserved for the newest and finest Blu-ray titles. Colors are every bit as impressive. The aqua-colored doors and various shades of tan and white dazzle in their natural accuracy. The image springs to life like never before, or at least not since its theatrical screenings. The interior of the map room is equally stunning; close-ups in those shots of Indy dusting off the floor reveal every last grain of sand with a breathtaking tactile appearance, not to mention the rough stone work revealed underneath. The darkened Well of Souls location reveals wonderful shadow detail and stability, and the final sequence displays all of the gory after-effects of the Ark's opening with face-melting and head-exploding precision. It's a breathtaking transfer that will leave fans with a permanent smile and eager to watch it again. The downsides are few. There's the occasional white speckle, infrequent but present and most readily evident in the film's early classroom sequence (with the ""Love You"" girl). There's also a fingerprint-like smudge visible on the Cairo sky around the 58-minute mark, seen at the top of the screen and just center-left of the middle of the screen. Still, despite a few minor hiccups, this is Raiders of the Lost Ark as it was meant to be seen and one of the finest catalogue Blu-ray transfers on the market.

The Temple of Doom (1984)
Score: 4.5/5

The Temple of Doom looks just as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's a warmer picture, with reddish flesh tones and a whole lot of fiery highlights in its second half. Red is definitely the predominant color throughout -- from Willie's ornate red dress and Indy's red lapel flower in Shanghai to the hellish depths of Pankot -- and it can be a bit bold, but the color palette in total is quite impressive, from the yellow raft to the blue turban riflemen seen at film's end. The palace's rich red and gold adornments and the mine's steamy blacks and grays are represented with pure, accurate shading. Black levels are rock-solid, too, critical down in the lower depths and darker realms and bug-infested rooms that are so prominent in the film's second half. Detail is striking. From the beginning during Indy's lounge confrontation with Lao Che and on through to the final action scene on the bridge with Mola Ram, the image offers dazzling clothing and facial textures that reveal every skin crease, bead of sweat, and clothing stitch with pinpoint precision. The decorative palace dazzles, the bugs appear sharply defined and are as shapely and creepy as ever, and the underground chambers offer refined and natural shapes. The film's best scene comes at the end during the battle on the bridge. The worn-down wood and frayed rope textures are absolutely striking, never mind the sweaty and filthy and tattered clothes worn by a tired and banged-up archaeologist. The image enjoys a light but critical grain structure that provides the finishing touches to a superb film-like image. Transfers like this are why Blu-ray was made!

The Last Crusade (1989)
Score: 5/5

Just as The Last Crusade might be the best movie of the bunch, its 1080p video transfer may be the finest in the collection. It's an extraordinary example of an older film appearing on Blu-ray with the looks of a brand-new movie. There's nary a flaw to be found, save for another random smudge or two (and these are verified on two televisions), most evident at the 5:15 mark, seen on a blue sky in a shot of young Indy about to jump down on his horse. Otherwise, this one's flawless. It's sharp and extraordinarily crisp, with every element supremely defined, from the rocky Utah mountains to the cobweb-infested final resting place of the Holy Grail. Those rocky textures are striking to say the least, complexly detailed even at a distance and with such precision and that viewers can nearly feel the rough surface just by looking at it. Clarity is so precise, in fact, that even close-ups of the Grail diary are easily read, and the introduction of the half-piece of the stone tablet offers startling detail across its well-worn surface. From the streets of Venice to the shadowy underground chamber located beneath the church-turned-library where ""X"" actually does mark the spot, from within the airship over Germany to the sandy beaches below, there's not a detail that's not brilliantly captured and beautifully displayed. Colors are equally brilliant, appearing even and accurate from the lightest earthen hues to brightest of red Nazi flags and armbands. Black levels are wonderful and flesh tones are even. The image is solidified by a steady layer of grain that puts the finishing touches on one of the best-looking Blu-ray releases ever, catalogue or otherwise.

The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)
Score: 4.5/5

Once again, Indy shines on Blu-ray. This time, the results are not at all surprising. It's the newest picture in the set by nearly twenty years and the only one with a previously released Blu-ray to its credit. As expected, the image dazzles. Not one of the previous three films yield an overpowering grain structure, but all three are a bit more obvious to the eye than the one in The Crystal Skull. The film's grain is fine to say the least, and the picture has a slightly smoother, sometimes overly bright and nearly blown-out sheen about it, but there's no evidence of harmful scrubbing. Details are extraordinary throughout the film, revealing the most complex textures this side of The Last Crusade. Facial textures are nothing short of fantastic, whether Indy's weathered and worn mug or Spalko's ultra-smooth skin that by design reveals not a single line or pore. The image is crisp and so well defined that some shots are just starling in their stability and natural accuracy, from the warm wooden accents within Marshall college to the dense jungles of Peru. It's during a truck chase in the latter that the film finds its single-best scene. Beat-up trucks, complex vegetation, and all of the dusty clothing details come together for a sparkling sequence that produces some of the finest film-like textures in the entire series. Colors are equally brilliant. Whether those rich green leaves or the pastel rainbow that defines the homes and accents around the nuclear family test town, the transfer handles each and every shade with striking realism. Even red and yellow ketchup bottles appear so natural that viewers might be momentarily mistaken into believing they're in a retro diner with Mutt and Indy and not in the comforts of the ultra-modern home theater. Black levels are superb and skin tones largely natural, though sometimes slightly pushing towards a gentle red or orange shading. This ranks right up there with the rest of the Indy Blu-ray presentations in terms of raw visual excellence. It's a somewhat different sort of look to be sure but certainly no less impressive.

AUDIO QUALITY:

Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)
Score: 5/5

Raiders of the Lost Ark has never sounded so good. Paramount's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless soundtrack dazzles with every explosion, all the supporting sound effects, and of course each note of John Williams' acclaimed, classic, and instantly recognizable main theme. Right from the get-go -- the Paramount logo that dissolves into a similar-looking Peruvian mountain -- the track introduces deep bass notes into the soundstage that are potent but not unnaturally so, strong enough to give a good, steady shake but not tear the theater's foundation apart. The audience is simultaneously immersed into the jungle environment; striking ambience gently surrounds the listener, and the cacophony is made complete with the precise inclusion of Williams' opening notes that are both foreboding and fun. Bass continues its even and natural assault as the temple collapses and the boulder rolls through the soundstage, all but destroying the couch and television in its path. As Indy, Jock, and Reggie soar into the sky in escape, so too does Williams' music soar, playing clearly, crisply, loudly, evenly, and with positive surround support. The roar of the engine is heard and felt as the plane carrying Indy to Nepal takes off, and the gunfire inside Marion's bar that follows explodes into the stage; automatic weapons chatter erupts from all over the listening area and Indy's pistol shots boom with heavy authority. In Cairo, the track continues with its excellence, immersing the listening audience into the environment and providing clear and potent explosions and gunfire. Even subtleties such as gently blowing wind chimes heard when Indy and Sallah take the headpiece to be translated will amaze audiences with the lifelike sound. Action scenes, even under blaring music and heavy effects, manage to incorporate pinpoint sound elements. A squeaky door hinge during the truck chase sequence sounds so real that listeners might turn their heads to see who's opening the door to the home theater. The swirling spirits and gusty winds at film's end penetrate the listening area with frightening accuracy. Dialogue is even and never lost under surrounding music or effects, though there are a few quieter moments where it could benefit from an uptick in volume, such as the scene in which Indy and Marcus meet with Army Intelligence in the college lecture hall. Overall, this is one impressive soundtrack, a complete and wholly satisfying listening experience from start to finish. Like the video, it's as if it were recorded yesterday. This is movie buff and Blu-ray audio heaven rolled into one.

The Temple of Doom (1984)
Score: 5/5

The Temple of Doom roasts sound systems with a superb DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless soundtrack. Once again, music startles with its clarity and precise spacing. It spreads evenly and with tremendous room-filling balance, including a healthy and seamless surround sound integration. Williams' score is the sonic highlight in a movie with a number of wonderful sound elements, beginning with a precise and smooth dance number. Willie's vocals aren't piercing or intrusively sharp but rather lifelike. Her singing subtly and effectively drifts off to the side when she moves towards the right side of the soundstage (from the audience's perspective), but the effect is short-lived and the vocals remain naturally focused in the center. The ensuing chaos is nicely delivered, with plenty of fast-moving sonic niceties filling the stage but doing so with a natural presence that places the listening audience in the middle of the night club. When the heroes escape, Lao Che's plane whirs across the stage with good power, and the coming crash and sonic assault that sees Indy and company slide down a mountainside on an inflatable raft is met with loud but balanced and seamless power. Village exteriors and a nighttime camping scene offer fabulous natural ambience, the kind that effortlessly encircles the audience and perfectly recreates the natural sounds of life. Paramount's track handles the heaviest final act action moments with the precision listeners demand. The clanking around the mining site is true, and the sense of power delivered by both the rushing water and the shrieking, rattly ride through the mine's cart system places listeners in the midst of the underground action. It's a demo-worthy stretch that throws a whole lot of sound at the audience but does so with clarity even through the most challenging sound elements. Rounded into shape by pitch-perfect dialogue reproduction, The Temple of Doom's lossless soundtrack comes through in every scene.

The Last Crusade (1989)
Score: 5/5

It might feel like old hat to read the same sort sorts of insights into these audio tracks, but one will likely never grow tired of listening to them. In short, this is another rip-roaring, all-in, completely satisfying DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. It's every bit as good as both Raiders and Temple in its fullness, spacing, bass, and clarity. Musical delivery is typically stunning, whether fast-paced action notes or more gentle dramatic elements. Spacing is true, the surrounds are used to marvelous effect, and the clarity of every note through the entire range is perfect. The Action scenes tell the same kind of story. Every moment is energized and precise, whether something as simple as a galloping horse across a pebbly Utah terrain or bursts of automatic weapons fire all but tearing the listening area to shreds. The heaviest elements -- waves crashing and rain pouring and thunder booming in a nighttime, ship-top fight sequence early in the film -- offer unbeatable clarity and precision even through the most potent and sonically intense assault in the movie. Later, a raging fire engulfs the listening area, planes zip from one speaker to the next, and an artillery shell zooms across the stage and impacts in the rear with nearly frightening accuracy, never mind the low end sensation that is the impact and explosion. A single gunshot near film's end that puts a bullet in one of the characters bangs with effortless power and reverberates through the cavernous locale for some time, yielding a believable lifelike effect. Gentle ambience defines many of the quieter scenes and always plays seamlessly and clearly, placing the listeners in each of the film's numerous locations. Lastly, dialogue is true and pure, delivered faultlessly from the center. The Last Crusade, considering the quality of the film and its amazing video and audio presentations, just may be the year's reference catalogue title.

The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)
Score: 5/5

This has been a set of revelatory audio. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's soundtrack is just as good, but not at all unexpectedly so. It's made the switch to DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless from the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD track from the film's original Blu-ray release. Both are expert sound presentations. As with the other films, this DTS track absolutely dazzles from the opening shot to the end credits with its impressive, immersive, and infallible sound presentation. Music is one again brilliantly reproduced, with crisp, detailed notes through the entire range and a pleasing low end that's the right balance between ""strong"" and ""overpowering."" Music drifts to the sides and into the backs with a natural flow that effortlessly envelops the listening audience with John Williams' wonderful score. Gunfire is rhythmic and strong, from the opening barrage of automatic weapons fire at the military checkpoint that sounds and feels like it's ripping through the stage from front to back and on through to the rattling and ricocheting of the various shots heard during the jungle chase sequence. Even the whooshing sound of a rocket-propelled grenade ripping through the listening area will leave listeners slowly getting back off of the floor from in front of or behind the couch, having taken cover from the incoming explosive. In the nuclear test town, an alarm klaxon blares in the distance with great strength and sonic foreboding. The nuclear blast itself isn't quite as rumbly and potent as some listeners might expect -- it's more about strong winds than it is sheer force and bass -- but the cumulative effect will leave listeners all but feeling the heat and the blast's concussive power. The track does find plenty of energy in the triple water fall scene, where the crashing liquid surrounds the stage and delivers so much power that the neighbors won't fall back asleep for a week. Even better, the clarity of the moment is unbeatable; it's not just a barrage of sound but a barrage of accurate sound. Even the more subtle effects impress in placement, spacing, and movement. Floating gunpowder (it makes sense in the movie) flies from one speaker to the next with seamless precision. Lifelike ambient effects surround the viewer, whether the din of a hectic crowd of teenagers waiting to visit with Dr. Jones or the cacophony of Peruvian wildlife heard in various exterior scenes. It's a wonderful track, and with its pitch-perfect dialogue reproduction, it's at the very least as good as the rest of the Indy listens, if not the best and most finely detailed of the bunch.",1441584000,,18980,5.048484848484849

I love the movies, even Crystal Skull, but the quality of the movie reproduction on Blu Ray is very poor.  The picture actually gets blurry or seems out of focus from time to time.  Also, if you stop the movie at any point, it doesn't take you back to your stopping point.  There is no ""play from last point"" option when you restart.  Then there is the packaging.

Which all the people review that type says best picture because you see more. Sure you know what talking about. So you make up your own mind. For me after while I can ignore the black. But if I look away and back it is there and it is there for while till I can ignore it. The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is two disc(s) called special edition. One disc is 122 min. Other is 163 min.

And, lo, the skies did open and there burst forth on Blu-ray ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, the ""Alien"" quadrilogy, the ""Star Wars"" sextril..., sixtrol..., six of 'em.  And life was good.  Now, ""The Indiana Jones"" series reaches BD, and the world is complete.

Lucasfilm Ltd. and Paramount Home Media collaborated on the full restoration of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" under the supervision of director Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt, and they digitally remastered the picture and sound of ""The Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade"" alongside ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""  In addition, they included in the set a bonus disc of documentaries, featurettes, and interviews.  Lions and tiger and bears.  Oh, my....

In the American Film Institute's 2003 poll of top movie heroes, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) placed second behind Atticus Finch, the courageous lawyer from ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  Given that Finch is a decidedly nontraditional hero, we can safely assume the folks at the AFI think Indy is the best conventional, swashbuckling action hero of all time.

Not that we needed the AFI's word on the matter.  Indy is a lot of people's favorite hero, with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" regularly winning viewer-opinion polls as the best adventure film ever made.  So, here he is in full, high-definition picture and sound in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" packaged in big BD box set.

Probably everyone by now knows the genesis of the movies.  Back in the late Seventies, buddies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had just come off the successes of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" respectively, and they wanted to do something different, something old-fashioned, something that didn't rely on flashy, outer-space technology.  Spielberg had been wanting to do a James Bond-type epic, and Lucas had just the right story idea.  They settled on a homage to the movie serials of their youth--the brief, one-reel cliff-hangers they remembered from Saturday afternoon chapters of children's adventures that featured heroes like Jack Armstrong, Flash Gordon, Commando Cody, Dick Tracy, Zorro, Ace Drummond, Captain America, Buck Rogers, Terry and the Pirates, Spy Smasher, and the Masked Marvel.  They made their hero an archaeologist and named him after Lucas's dog.  They borrowed Indy's hat from Humphrey Bogart in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" the leather jacket from Commando Cody, and the bullwhip from the likes of Lash La Rue and Whip Wilson.  My guess is that Lucas and Spielberg also patterned their hero in part after the fictional character Allan Quatermain, H. Rider Haggard's adventurer in ""King Solomon's Mines"" (1885); and in an ironic twist, Sean Connery, who plays Indiana's father in ""The Last Crusade,"" starred as Quartermain in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003).

All the while, Lucas and Spielberg had Tom Selleck in mind for the hero, but Selleck was doing the ""Magnum, P.I."" television show at the time, so then they considered other people like Nick Nolte.  Instead, the role of Indiana Jones went fortuitously to Harrison Ford, the haughty rogue of the initial ""Star Wars"" saga, and the rest is history.  Of course, we'll never know how good Selleck or Nolte might have been, but there's no doubt about Ford.  His modesty, charm, and self-effacing style combined with a virile strength and masculinity that appealed as much to men as to women, and as much to adults as to children.  With Lucas co-writing and co-producing and Spielberg co-writing and directing, the series became an instant success.

Incidentally, a cliff-hanger (or cliffhanger) for those of you too young or too uninformed to know is a precarious ending to a chapter, often used in old-time movie serials, leaving audiences in suspense and wanting to come back for the next installment; things like the hero hanging off a cliff (naturally), falling from an airplane, or apparently being blasted to smithereens by a bomb exploding under his seat.  Today, the word ""cliff-hanger"" refers to any suspenseful predicament of which the outcome is uncertain until the very last moment.  The ""Indiana Jones"" movies are a succession of cliff-hangers, and what fun Lucas and Spielberg must have had (and must still be having) concocting them.  In a series of episodic adventures, the stories subject poor Indy to everything from tarantula spiders to deadly snakes, giant rolling balls to medieval snares, near-fatal pitfalls to atomic bombs and the fires of hell.  And Nazis.  Two of the adventures feature Nazis.  ""I hate these guys,"" says Indy in a moment of supreme understatement.

The ""Indy"" films are among that rare breed that have their tongue planted firmly in their cheek but never ridicule the action-adventure style; they're entertaining with their high spirits and good humor, while being serious participants in the genre.  ""The Crimson Pirate"" (1952) was able to poke good-natured fun at pirate movies while being a great swashbuckler in its own right; and many of the Bonds pay friendly homage to spy capers while being suspenseful and exciting spy capers themselves.  Likewise, the ""Indiana Jones"" films take great joy in having fun with action-adventure flicks at the same time they establish themselves as the foremost champions of such thrillers.  It's not an easy accomplishment.

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"":
Anyway, it all started in 1981 with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" a title that had more than a few folks puzzled.  As the Wife-O-Meter and I were leaving a theater in the San Francisco Bay Area after seeing ""Raiders"" for the first time, we overheard a teenage girl saying to her companion, ""I liked the movie, but why did they call it 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'?  I didn't see any football players in it.""  Honest.  True story.

In ""Raiders"" the time is 1936, and Jones, a professor of archaeology, is hunting for the Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, the most sacred object of the ancient Israelites and thought lost after the sacking of the Temple in Jerusalem, where the Israelites kept it in the Holy of Holies.  In the movie, Indy tells us the Ark possesses tremendous supernatural powers, carrying with it ""the wrath of God,"" thus making it a subject of interest to Adolph Hitler, who in real life believed to some extent in the occult and actually did try to collect various reputedly metaphysical items.

The U.S. Government wants the Ark before the Nazis can get it, and they send Jones, an expert on such matters, out to look for it.  Along the way, Indy meets his old sweetheart, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), still the best of the ""Indiana Jones"" female leads for her intelligence and spunk.  Then there are the good guys who help Indy:  Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies); and the baddies, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), a rival archaeologist out for himself alone, and Toht (Ronald Lacey), a Gestapo agent who gets one the best laughs in the film from a coat hanger.  Everyone knows the rest, the giant rolling ball, the spiders, the snakes (""Why'd it have to be snakes?""), the shoot-outs, the adventures continuing from what appears to be the West Coast to Nepal to Egypt to heaven knows where else.  And all along the way, there's one hairbreadth escape after another.  Classic stuff.  Trust me.

Film rating:  10/10

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"":
A few years after ""Raiders,"" in 1984, Lucas and Spielberg tried to top themselves with the second Indiana Jones installment, ""The Temple of Doom.""  Attempting to make the new film as different as possible from the first one yet retain the adventurous atmosphere, they set it in China and India, gave Indy a kid for a sidekick, and provided him with a stereotypical ditzy blonde girlfriend rather than the plucky and resourceful Marion of the earlier film.  They also took out the Nazis, set it a year earlier in 1935, confined three-quarters of it to a single locale, the cavernous underground depths of a mountain temple, and designed the plot around a group of children in jeopardy.  The result was a film that felt more claustrophobic than its predecessor and an adventure that was darker and more somber.  In fact, the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board considered several scenes in the film so grisly, it later inspired them to come up with the now-familiar PG-13 classification to supplement their regular PG.  The filmmakers even toned down the original title, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death.""

""Temple of Doom"" pays homage to any number of classic films along the course of its plot, beginning with ""Casablanca,"" Ford in the Bogey role, continuing with ""Gunga Din,"" and adding bits and pieces of things like ""Chandu the Magician"" and ""The Pied Piper,"" among others.  Indy's job in this one is to retrieve a sacred stone stolen from an Indian village, a stone the villagers believe brings them good fortune.  Without it, their land has gone to waste and their children are disappearing.  Turns out, the children are being kidnapped by a nearby Thuggee cult to work in the mines beneath an abandoned Hindu temple, Pankot Palace.

The filmmakers strove mightily to outdo ""Raiders,"" but rather than the adventure springing naturally from the story line, they generated most of the excitement this time from a sequence of gross-out gags and several exhilarating stunts.  There's a banquet scene, for instance, that features monkey brains, eels, eyeball soup, and various huge bugs to eat; there's a segment with a Thuggee priest reaching into a man's chest and pulling out his heart; and there's a passageway filled with creepy-crawly insects that is an obvious endeavor to one-up the snakes in ""Raiders.""  The three best action sequences are a fight on a narrow rope bridge and two amusement park-type attractions, a bobsled ride down a Himalayan peak and a wild, heart-pounding roller-coaster ride inside the temple's subterranean tunnels.  The latter is the highlight of the film.

Assisting Indy this time out are Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott, an American nightclub singer who gets shanghaied into the adventure, and eleven-year-old Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round, a young friend who comes along willingly.  Ms. Capshaw was one of a multitude of women who auditioned for the part, by the way, and the film is where she first meet Spielberg; they married several years later.  Indian actor Amrish Puri and TV and film actor Roshan Seth play the villains, Mola Ram, leader of the Thuggee cult, and Chattar Lal, the shifty prime minister, respectively.  Also look for a bit part by Dan Aykroyd.

Film rating:  8/10

""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"":
""The Temple of Doom"" had been another smash success with the public, but so many critics assailed it for its dark tone that Lucas and Spielberg went back to their roots, so to speak, with the third installment, ""The Last Crusade"" (1989).  Indeed, almost everything about ""The Last Crusade"" harks back to ""Raiders,"" from plot to characters.  The result is more satisfying than ""Temple of Doom,"" although throughout the film it seems as though we've been there before.

In this third episode, set in 1938, two years after ""Raiders,"" Indy is trying to find the legendary Holy Grail, the cup from which legend says Christ drank at the Last Supper and into which his blood poured on the cross.  The Grail was the object of quests in the Arthur tradition, and in the film it possesses the power of healing and rejuvenation.  Naturally, Hitler and the Nazis are after it, too.

The film's structure is much the same as ""Raiders,"" starting with a mini adventure about Indy as a Boy Scout (River Phoenix); it has little to do with the rest of the story except to set the pace and provide some historical data on how Indy became afraid of snakes, learned to use a bullwhip, received the scar on his chin, and got his famous hat.  As usual, though, this prologue is one of the best parts of the picture.

The filmmakers opened up the movie to more exotic locales, this time Italy, Austria, Germany, and the Middle East (Petra, in Jordan).  They also brought back a couple of old faces in expanded parts, John Rhys-Davies and the late Denholm Elliot, and introduced several new characters, Julian Glover as Walter Donovan, a wealthy industrialist, and Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider, a love interest in the form of a femme fatale.

Most important, however, they brought in Sean Connery as Indy's dad, Professor Henry Jones, Sr., a high-minded father whose expectations his son was never able to meet.  But as a twist, they made the usually intrepid Connery an ultraconservative academician, shocked by his son's constant adventures and wild heroics.  Only once, when Connery clamps his hand on a Nazi thug, do we see the old, indomitable Bond showing through the professor's befuddled, mild-mannered exterior.  Connery and Ford establish a remarkably likable on-screen relationship that helps sell the film.  According to the comments of Spielberg and Lucas, there was some disagreement about using Connery, the filmmakers worrying that audiences might associate him too much with 007.  But, then, they remembered that Bond was one of the fictional characters upon which they based their hero, so using Connery would bring the series full circle.  In any case, the father-son relationship is at the heart of the movie and differentiates the film from the others, making it, instead of a pure action picture, a character piece with action in it.  (As an aside, there is really only a twelve-year age difference between Connery and Ford, but who cares.)

As with the ""Indy"" films before it, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" relies on a succession of rousing escapades and hairbreadth escapes.  Many younger people of my acquaintance who came to the Indiana Jones series late, with ""The Last Crusade"" as their first encounter, have commented that they like it better than ""Raiders,"" which to them seems too derivative of the series' later work.  Sorry, folks, other way around.  Nevertheless, although I personally find ""The Last Crusade"" a little less energetic and inspired than ""Raiders,"" there is much to enjoy, and both pictures stand out as the best of the series.

Film rating:  9/10

""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"":
It's no ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  But what movie is?  Nor is it another ""Temple of Doom"" or ""Last Crusade.""  None of us is as young as we used to be, and it's hard to recapture the pleasures of the past, especially when those pleasures were as bright and bracing as they were in 1981's ""Raiders"" and its two immediate sequels.  What a lot of people forget is that while director Steven Spielberg and co-writer and executive producer George Lucas attempted in ""Raiders"" to make a movie based on all the old-time serials and cliff-hangers they remembered from their youth, they did so in an entirely new and refreshing way.  They practically reinvented the adventure-movie genre, and ""Raiders"" went on to spawn not only the three sequels we have now but a host of other adventure films that continue to this day.

In 2008's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" Spielberg and Lucas, after an absence from the series of nineteen years, tried to recover some of the old spark.  If they didn't entirely succeed, it wasn't for lack of trying.  In their enthusiasm, they just overdid it.

The fact is, though, that by now we've all become so used to the action-adventure epic that Spielberg and Lucas helped create, it's hard even for them to top themselves.  As a result, much of ""The Crystal Skull"" seems tired or recycled.  Yet that is, I'm sure, exactly what the filmmakers wanted.  It's supposed to remind viewers of the old days, and it does so at almost every turn.

Needless to say, the most important ingredient in the movie series is back:  Harrison Ford as Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr., archaeologist and adventurer supreme.  I don't believe either of the filmmakers ever considered getting someone to replace Ford; he's the picture's greatest asset, regardless of his age.  Indeed, they made Ford's mid-sixties age an integral part of the movie, poking good-natured fun at it and heading off critics before they could make it an issue.  The very first time we see Indy, for instance, the filmmakers purposely give him a grizzled, disheveled, unshaven appearance in an effort to show him right off at his worst.  Get used to it, they're saying; we're all older (but better).

Happily, Ford is as spry as ever, and his derring-do seems as plausible (or implausible) as ever.  Sure, he's older, but who cares.  He remains the best part of the show, which, unfortunately, still seems weary despite Ford's tireless energy.  I think it may have something to do with the times having changed, and maybe Spielberg and Lucas finding it hard to keep up.  The fact is, films like ""Romancing the Stone,"" ""National Treasure,"" and the ""Die Hard"" saga have set the mark pretty high for humorous adventure thrillers, and even the talents of Spielberg and Lucas aren't limitless.  Now, with the advent of CGI, computer graphics, replacing a lot of the old special effects and physical stunt work, the filmmakers must have found themselves hard pressed to surpass their old glories.  And they don't.  Instead, they seem content merely to imitate past brilliance.  I rather suspect it's what Indy fans wanted all along, in any case.

OK, it's been nineteen years since the last installment, which had taken place around 1938, just before the onset of World War II, and the filmmakers were smart enough to realize that Ford and company could not pretend that time hadn't marched on; there would be no more fighting Nazis.  They wisely set their story two decades later, in 1957.  A lot of things had happened in the meantime, which the plot reveals in casual, incidental ways, things like our learning that Indy was a hero in WWII, while he continued teaching and doing his archaeological work.

What had changed in the passing decades?  Just as the filmmakers had made the earlier movies relevant to the late 1930s, they had to make ""Crystal Skull"" relevant to the 1950's.  Accordingly, they included some important cultural icons of the period.  There was by then the Cold War and the Russian Communists.  There was the atomic bomb.  There were the reports of UFOs that Hollywood had capitalized on since the days of the Roswell incident and pilot Kenneth Arnold's ""flying saucers.""  There were the KGB and the Nazca lines and mind control and alien beings.  Naturally, Spielberg and Lucas seized on these ideas for their plot elements.

Yet, they needed a central object, a rare and sacred artifact, for Indy to pursue.  They had already used the Ark of the Covenant, the fabled Shankara Stones, and the Holy Grail.  What did they have left?  They could have gone with the Spear of Longinus (or Spear of Destiny), I suppose, but that might have been too much like the Grail.  They chose, instead, the mysterious crystal skulls, which some people claim are pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifacts of great spiritual significance.  The fact that a number of such skulls, some undoubtedly real and some probably fakes, already exist in the hands of collectors must have seemed beside the point.  Therefore, we have Indy going off seeking the crystal skull of all crystal skulls, the one that holds the secret of an ancient city of gold and arcane inter-dimensional beings or some such nonsense.

""Chariots of the Gods, man!""  --""The Thing""

The movie sets a tongue-in-cheek tone from the beginning by having the Paramount mountain logo turn into a prairie-dog mound.  That's pretty cute.  Then the filmmakers establish the time period by having a group of young people driving a hot rod while listening to Elvis's ""Hound Dog.""

With some old friends of the series no longer available for the newer film (Sean Connery, Indy's father in ""The Last Crusade,"" chose not come out of retirement; Denholm Elliott, Marcus Brody, had passed away; and John Rhys-Davies, Sallah, is nowhere in sight), the filmmakers recruited a few new faces, as well as an old one.  The new faces include Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams, Indy's rebellious, long-lost son, showing up as a Marlon Brando ""Wild One"" look-alike; Jim Broadbent as Charles Stanforth, Indy's new college dean; Ray Winstone as ""Mac"" McHale, one of Indy's old adventuring companions; John Hurt as Professor Harold ""Ox"" Oxley, an intrepid archaeologist and close friend of the Jones family; and Cate Blanchett as Col. Dr. Irina Spalko, a nefarious, psychic harpy who seems patterned after James Bond villainesses like Rosa Kleb (""From Russia with Love"") and Irma Bunt (""On Her Majesty's Secret Service), though less convincing.  The returning face is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Indy's old flame from ""Raiders.""  Ms. Allen's Marion is as plucky and feisty as ever and makes a welcome return to the series.

And the script gives its characters a few good one-liners:  ""Put your hands down, will you?  You're embarrassing us,"" says Indy to Mac when armed baddies surround them.  ""What are you, like, eighty?"" Mutt asks Indy.  And when Indy shows his prowess in a fistfight, Mutt exclaims, ""You're a teacher?""  Indy answers, ""Part time.""

The fact is, though, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" not only has an unwieldy title, it has far too much going on it.  Where the older films concentrated on a simple plot line--Indy chasing an artifact--this one gets tangled up with too many bad guys, too many peripheral characters, and too many narrative contrivances.  By the time it's over, the filmmakers have thrown in everything but the kitchen sink, a problem that plagued Lucas's last few ""Star Wars"" sequels as well.

Nuking the fridge becomes a defining moment in ""The Crystal Skull,"" reminding us that this one is going more for silliness than for thrills.  Nevertheless, the thrills are there, and some of them are spectacular.  There's the usual globe-trotting to exotic locales; the usual assortment of high-octane chases and melodramatic encounters; the usual variety of unpleasant wildlife (snakes, ants, scorpions); the usual plethora of creepy-crawly dark places; the usual quota of ravishing scenery, most of it showing up in the last third of the picture; and the usual razzle-dazzle climax, this one reminiscent of the supernatural ending in ""Raiders"" but done up even more theatrically.  Meanwhile, you'll still hear the strains of the familiar John Williams musical score playing almost continuously in the background.

Everything you see in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is very much the same as you remember it from previous episodes, so it won't disappoint old fans.  The movie just never does anything particularly unusual or precedent-setting to position itself above its competition these days.  It's still fun, mind you, but not as much fun as we might have hoped.

To a lot of viewers ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" may seem a little shopworn or old hat (or old fedora, if you please), but, as I've said, I'm sure filmmakers Spielberg and Lucas meant it that way.  They tried to capture a new spirit in an old form, and while the ultimate result may have escaped them, you can't question their objectives.  What we have is nevertheless playful and entertaining, even if it looks, deliberately, as though we've seen it all before.

Film rating:  7/10

Video:
I quote from Paramount's press release, where they say ""'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has been meticulously restored under the supervision of director Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt.  Additionally, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' have both been remastered alongside 2008's 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' making this landmark release the first time all four films in the epic and award-winning franchise have been available together in sparkling high definition.""

Paramount used dual-layer BD50's, MPEG-4/AVC encodes, and THX standards for all four films, presenting them in their native aspect ratios, 2.35:1.  Despite the restoration, however, ""Raiders"" still looks the softest and most veiled of the four films, with faces decidedly too dark for absolute realism.  Colors, though, are mostly good, and in brighter-lit scenes they show up nicely.  One notices varying degrees of inherent print grain throughout the series, and it adds to the natural texture of the images.  ""Temple of Doom"" is slightly sharper and cleaner than ""Raiders,"" although it's still a touch soft.  Colors are brighter, but faces remain dark.  ""The Last Crusade"" offers the brightest, sharpest, clearest PQ of the bunch, and it's a joy to watch.  For ""Crystal Skull"" the image appears a tad glassy at times and a tad too pastel at other times, but I suspect this was the director's intent because that was pretty much as I remember it from a motion-picture theater.  Maybe Spielberg figured these were the predominant shades of the Fifties and went accordingly.  I dunno.  Otherwise, you'll find brilliant hues in ""Crystal Skull,"" again a light film grain, good definition, and only a few moments of softness.  Shadow detail and black levels are also strong, which go a long way toward mitigating some of my concerns about the fantasy colors.

Audio:
The Paramount audio engineers use lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the sound on all four movies.  While the surround effects on the first three films may not always be pinpoint discrete in the side and rear channels, they do produce a satisfyingly comfortable, enveloping dimensionality, evident from the start of ""Raiders"" with jungle sounds, birds, and music.  As we might expect with the fourth film, made well into the multichannel age, the surrounds yield a more immersive sensation.  There's generally a roaring bass present in all four films, taut and deep.  Also, there is a terrific dynamic impact in all the films, with strong, quick transient response.  Front-channel stereo spread is wide, and John Williams's lush scores get a lush treatment throughout.

Extras:
In this five-disc box set, disc one contains ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and teaser, theatrical, and reissue trailers (HD); disc two contains ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and teaser and theatrical trailers (HD); disc three contains ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" and teaser and theatrical trailers (HD); and disc four contains ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and three theatrical trailers (HD).  The trailers for the first three films are in a 1.78:1 ratio; for the final film at 2.35:1.

The extras on the movie discs also include from sixteen to thirty-five scene selections each; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc five is the main bonus disc, containing over seven hours of material on all four films.  Things begin with ""On the Set with Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which includes two parts:  ""From Jungle to Desert"" and ""From Adventure to Legend,"" each clocking in at about twenty-nine minutes and each in high def.

Next, we find five making-of documentaries; these include ""The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (from 1981 and previously unavailable on DVD) fifty-seven minutes; ""The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" more recently made, fifty minutes; ""The Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" also recently made, forty-one minutes; ""The Making of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" recently made, thirty-five minutes; and ""The Making of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (HD), obviously recently made, twenty-nine minutes.

After those we have a lengthy series of brief, behind-the-scenes featurettes, each of them from eight to twenty-two minutes long; however, there is no ""Play All"" button, so you need to slog through them one at a time.  These include ""The Stunts of Indiana Jones,"" ""The Sound of Indiana Jones,"" ""The Music of Indiana Jones,"" ""The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones,"" ""Raiders:  The Melting Face!,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Creepy Crawlies"" (with optional pop-ups), ""Travel with Indiana Jones:  Locations (with optional pop-ups), ""Indy's Women:  The American Film Institute's Tribute,"" ""Indy's Friends and Enemies,"" ""Iconic Props"" (""Crystal Skull,"" HD), ""The Effects of Indy"" (""Crystal Skull,"" HD), and ""Adventures in Post Production"" (""Crystal Skull, HD).

The five discs come packaged in a hardcover album with their own sleeves, the album further enclosed in a colorful, handsomely embossed, stiff-cardboard box.  It makes for a classy affair, although I wish the studio hadn't used the separate sleeves for each disc because it makes it hard to get the discs out without putting your fingerprints on them.  Be careful.

Parting Thoughts:
Whoopi Goldberg once remarked that ""Movies are supposed to be big, because if they're not, they're television.""  Well, the Indiana Jones movies are big, and it's a shame most of us can't enjoy them in our homes in the sheer size that motion-picture theaters display them.  But these new Paramount Blu-ray transfers are probably as close as we're going to get.  They're bold and beautiful, and, depending on your television screen, they're big enough.

The ratings below are my averaged scores for all four films, with ""Raiders"" the best movie, ""The Last Crusade"" having the best picture quality, and ""Crystal Skull"" the best sound.

2779024,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), taking place in 1936, has college professor, archaeologist, and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) being informed that the Nazis are on the search for the long lost ark of the covenant. The Nazis hope to find the ark and use its godly powers to help make the German army invincible. Jones sets off on a quest to find the mysterious ark with the help of Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) takes place in 1935 and has Indiana Jones, singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) narrowly escaping a Chinese mob. They escape via plane before abandoning it over India where they encounter a small village that has lost their sacred and holy stone. Jones and crew go on a journey to retrieve the sacred object for the villagers.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) takes place in 1938 and has Indiana Jones finding out that his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), has gone missing. Henry went missing during his search for the Holy Grail, the cup used by Christ during the Last Supper. Jones heads off to Europe to find his father while also running into the nefarious Nazis again.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) takes place during the Cold War in 1957. The more elderly Indiana Jones has been captured by agents of the Soviet Union. The communists want to obtain the missing crystal skull hoping that joining it with the others will unleash a great power to benefit them. After escaping, he encounters Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) who tells him that his old professional friend Professor Oxley (John Hurt) was looking for the crystal skull.

What really makes these films great is that there is a good combination of exciting action and a sense of adventure. I found both Raiders and The Last Crusade to be essentially on par with each other in these terms. Both of them were a lot of fun to watch and they were really outstanding examples of great film making. Temple of Doom was a little weaker due to its darker premise, unnecessary use of gross-out humor, and annoying side characters. Crystal Skull comes off as the weakest of the four films. It had poor use of CGI special effects and a rather lousy premise with aliens and a sci-fi theme that seems out-of-place for an Indiana Jones film. Despite these weaknesses, I found all four of the films to be enjoyable and, overall, a great adventure.

Harrison Ford truly shines in all of these films as the titular Indiana Jones, easily one of the greatest characters in cinematic history and recognizable to anyone regardless of whether they have seen any of the movies or not.

This DVD set not only includes all four movies but also numerous bonus features that includes behind the scenes features, interviews with many of the people involved such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford, and concept art.

All in all, this DVD collection is a great way to own these fun and entertaining movies. I would recommend this set to anyone that likes action-adventure films.",1433030400,,3079,4.754681647940075

2779050,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Being a fan of these movies, I have to say this package is a nice way to get all of them together. However, you do have to handle the discs with care coming out of their individual sleeves, just like the Star Wars box set. It seems the manufacturers want the profit of these movies in HD, but sometimes the designers of these ""boxes"" they put them in need to go back to the drawing board. I have seen some put the discs right on top of one another in sets or TV series. For example, Warner Brothers has a 4 disc Blu-ray set of Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" out and that one has all four movies in one holder, all four on top of one another. Now, not the easiest way for a customer to get to the movie they may want to watch, is it? This set here has them sleeved separately. They are in snug, for certain. The housing for each one sits on a slick black colored piece of cardboard. They will not fall out by simply pressing the sides together of each sleeve, but it may be easier to get them out that way. Just wipe off any smudges or prints you leave on the edges before you put them in the player, you should be just fine. That's what I do and I have no problems.
The movies themselves look really good. I have a VIZIO ultra 4k with Sony Blu-ray player. They all look great! I compared the Raiders of the Lost Ark Blu-ray with the THX DVD Raiders edition from a few years ago. The Blu-ray looks better and sounds better, at least with my equipment.
Softness, grainy issues, etc. may be caused by your particular equipment being used. I don't know. All I know is I didn't have such problems with my set on my electronics.  RAIDERS is 1981, so don't expect it to look like Avatar. I was happy with it and it is my favorite movie in the set.
Crystal Skulls was my least followed by Temple of Doom.
I always try and tell the guys I know that are just starting their ""movie library"" on Blu to get some good equipment to watch them on. It does effect the movie image. In other words, you can't watch a VHS top of the line cassette on an HDTV. The same goes for DVD. They were not made for HDTVs. They came out after Laserdisc was fading as a format and it offered a smaller practical way of watching a  movie without flipping the big disc over. The audio and video is compressed also and that is why you have a slight pause in DVD movies because of it going to the dual layer it was made with. With Blu, that is all gone.
These movies are classics, but who knows about Crystal Skulls. Perhaps in time, we can learn to appreciate this entry into the franchise. For me, too much ""Spielberg Sci-Fi"" was involved with it. It's ok and nice to have here, but not the best in the series.

The Special Features disc is just fabulous and am very excited to have it here on Blu-ray. ~

2779054,4,B000NQRE9Q,"These are great movies for a great price and it is nice having them all on Blu-ray. Unfortunately if you want to convert them to your VUDU digital on-line library they will not be accepted because they're from England. Yeah I was surprised too. That's OK because I can always pay VUDU their outrageous price of approx. $72.00  for all four movies to be placed in my on-line library.  There could be a 20% discount for a bundle of all the films if they ever offer one. Of course that's a long shot because Paramount hasn't released the movies as a digital bundle YET...... I'll keep my fingers crossed. Also they are not Ultra Violet approved, that's another bummer.",1430697600,,665,4.579831932773109

The movies look fantastic on Blu-ray; you'd never guess they were made 30 years ago. If you didn't know any better, you'd swear these were recent movies, except for a few computer-screen scenes that were state of the art back in the day and the wonderful lack of CGI. I speak only about the first three films, of course; the Crystal Skull is a tarnish to the name Indiana Jones, and everyone who worked on it or appeared in it should feel eternal shame.

This set comes in a thin pack with paper sleeves. When the Simpsons did this, I scratched several discs on the first removal and quit buying that series. I would not have bought these if I'd taken the time to find out. I haven't removed the discs yet and I'll probably buy new cases for them before I do.",1424131200,,603,4.336283185840708

2779365,2,B000NQRE9Q,"Had to return this one because the slick packaging pinches the disks too tightly and it takes a lot of fingertip pinch/pull force to get them out. Squeezing the sleeves to create an opening doesn't help at all.

Experience has shown how fragile Blu-ray disks are, so I fully expect the disks to start failing after a few trips to the player--well after the return window has expired. Also, studios don't replace Blu-ray disks that stop working.",1418774400,,444,4.766233766233766

2779369,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This complete box set of Indiana Jones is sure to please. The series is quite generous with action and adventure, with thrills and close calls thrown in throughout. Indiana Jones' treasure hunting, archeological exploration adventures take him some of the most exotic (and dangerous) locales around the world. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has Indy racing for the lost Ark of the Covenant containing the Ten Commandments, trying to stay one step ahead of the Nazis. ""Temple of Doom"" places Indiana in India, helping to recover a sacred stone stolen from a small village by an evil resurrected cult. ""The Last Crusade"" brings Indy and his father together in order to find the fabled Holy Grail, while also trying to outwit yet another Nazi army. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" brings Indy back for one last adventure, this time in search of mystical crystal skulls in Peru. Soviets take the place of the Nazis in this one.",1418601600,,917,4.8471337579617835

2779443,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures consists of the following movies of the Indiana Jones franchise.

*The Raiders of the Lost Ark - the first film of the Indiana Jones franchise. It is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride. This is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with.

*Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom - the sequel to The Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Set years before the events of the first film, it is sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun.

*Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade - the third film of the Indiana Jones franchise. Of the three Jones films, it may well become the sentimental favorite. It captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie as it was lighter and more comedic than its predecessor,the movie returns the series to the brisk serial adventure of Raiders Of The Lost Ark while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father and son dynamic.

*Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull - the fourth movie of the franchise. Though the plot elements are certainly familiar, it still delivers the thrills and Harrison Ford's return in the title role is more than welcome for he still has the charisma to reinvent one of the most-beloved characters in screen history. It isn't bad but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone.

This is one great collection of films that an Indiana Jones fan would surely want to own.",1414540800,,1564,4.551601423487544

I saw an interview with Spielberg where he sort of apologized for both Temple of Doom (a dark period in his life) and Crystal Skull (they reached too far with the concept and action), but as long as the original Raiders and Last Crusade are in there, I'm good. And Kingdom of the Crystal Skull does make for a fine coaster.

2779508,3,B000NQRE9Q,"While the films look outstanding on Blu-ray and the ""Bonus features"" disc includes very interesting material, the way the discs are stored is just awful.

Looking at the pictures shows it. They are stored in a book-style case where scratching is a possibility. Yes, Blu-ray discs are less vulnerable to scratching, however, I got a little scratch on my ""Crusade"" disc from pulling it out too fast. Yes, it was my fault, but if the case design was more like a normal DVD/Blu-ray case, it would never have happened. (And yes, I HATE scratches. Don't anyone say anything like ""It's only a scratch you *****"". I really do care about a little scratch. You know who you are.)

Evidently, I'm not the only one who has experienced this. Just read some other reviews. I would recommend: buying the Blu-rays separate instead of this ""Complete Adventures"" edition (which could NOT include ""Kingdom""), buying this and storing the discs in other cases, or, lastly, buying this but treating the discs with extra extra care. But with the latter, good luck avoiding scratches...

I hate to give it three stars, but I would be lying if I didn't.",1409529600,3,1128,4.774358974358974

2779607,4,B000NQRE9Q,It must be the first three films in this box set. Took one star off for including Kingdome of the Krystal Skulls,1403654400,,112,4.136363636363637
2779608,5,B000NQRE9Q,"all 4 titles nice box and artwork, loved the Indiana Jones series so all of them in one buy was a great deal at under $35,  watch it like a kid reading a comic book. sometimes not realistic, just good entertainment and sometimes feasible (as in Raiders)",1403654400,,253,4.382978723404255
2779609,5,B000NQRE9Q,This Blu-ray is such an excellent collection that you don't mind having Crystal Skull.  The first three are worth it alone.,1403481600,,123,4.857142857142857
2779610,5,B000NQRE9Q,I love this movie! The case is very well-illustrated and shows some scenes (the best scenes) of each movie. It is a good quality. I recommend as a very nice gift to a Indiana Jones fan.,1403481600,,185,4.166666666666667
2779611,5,B000NQRE9Q,"It's Indy!  Our 7 year old son had taken an interest in seeing these movies after playing the Lego Indiana Jones game on Playstation, but they tend to be played too close to bedtime.  This set was the right price, and I got to see The Temple of Doom again!",1403395200,,256,4.1
2779612,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Simply put, this collection is fantastic. I love the box design and all the movies included.  An excellent gift for the fan who doesn't already own the movies, or for the collector who wants an attractive case for a great series.",1403222400,,229,4.585365853658536
2779613,4,B000NQRE9Q,This is a great collection and a great price. Raiders of the lost ark: The remaster quality is kind of poor as if they forgot to do some scenes but still better than any other versions. Temple of doom: Great remaster quality but there was one scene that did not look as good. The last crusade: Perfect remaster could not be more pleased. Kingdom of the Crystal skull: Since it came out in 2008 it has great quality and probably nothing was done to it. Bonus fetures: Kind of disappointed in the bonuses because all you get is each movies trailer and featurette of how they made each movie. There are no deleted scenes (wich are my favorite thing) so that to me was the most disappointing thing. All in all its great set the best one you can get but not as much love was put in it as Star Wars was.,1403222400,,797,4.215686274509804
2779614,5,B000NQRE9Q,Classic trilogy ! If you enjoy adventure movies I recommend this one. This movie brings back so many memories. I grew up with the Indiana Jones and the blu ray makes watching so much more enjoyable!,1403136000,,198,4.527777777777778
2779615,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Great value! All four movies (even though we NEVER intend to watch the fourth one again!) Contains original versions of the movies complete with the special effects of the time. Our kids are a little spoiled by CGI because they kept pointing out how OBVIOUS the green screen is, but overall they liked the storyline. Kind of like watching the original Star Wars movies, dated special effects can't overshadow a good story! My 13 year old son is now ready and asking to watch the Young Indiana Jones series.",1402963200,,506,4.696629213483146

2779618,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Great price on Amazon for this Blu Ray set. Bought this for my 5-year old son's birthday, and he has watched it a thousand times since (Daddy too!)  Definitely worth adding to your collection!",1402531200,,192,4.647058823529412

2779620,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I love the Indian Jones movies, and just recently got a blue-ray player. When I saw that I could get the entire Indiana Jones movie set on blue-ray at such a wonderful price. I couldn't resist.",1402358400,,193,4.388888888888889
2779621,5,B000NQRE9Q,"What can you say? It is a blue ray version of indiana jones, awesome. We wanted the coplete collection and this is perfectr slim line and nice packaging.",1402358400,,153,4.5
2779622,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Love Indiana Jones, and even more on Blu Ray. Definitely add this to your collection. Even the older movies look better in the HD Blu Ray version",1402272000,,145,4.407407407407407
2779623,1,B000NQRE9Q,"I really don't like when someone reviews movies based only on tech issues, but this Blu Ray has a horrible, and I mean, horrible transfer. I have done everything to try ""fixing"" my player to adhere to these issues, which include jumpy lines in clothes and graininess that doesn't fit the foreground, and the character's skin looking sickly and just terrible. Overall the Blu Ray transfer, compared to, for instance, to JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, is just plain bad, and I cannot believe no one else is having these issues. I bought this and am sending it back pronto, and going with my old DVD box-set. Beware!",1402185600,16,609,4.700934579439252
2779624,5,B000NQRE9Q,Everyone should watch this fantastic action-adventure movie. The acting is incredible and the special effects are still stunning. The remastered Blu-ray edition was done with expertise.,1402185600,,185,6.153846153846154
2779625,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I appreciate these movies even more now, as back in the 80s, when they were first released, (the first 3 of course).  It takes me back to my high school days, as well as college.  I even like 'Crystal Skulls', which is not as bad as some make it out to be, though not as good as the first three.  'Raiders' looks a little grainy, about the same as the dvd version, but overall this series looks great on blu-ray  I think it is a better series than 'Star Wars' in which Harrison Ford also stars, but I know I am in the minority on that.  I highly recommend this set to everyone of all ages!  (Yes, even 'Crystal Skulls' for you naysayers.)  On a side note, I had to return the first set I ordered because the audio got distorted on 'Raiders' at an hour and a half through the movie.  I ordered a replacement set and the discs play perfectly.  Thank you to Amazon, as I can always count on your excellent customer service!",1402099200,,920,4.181818181818182
2779626,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Nothing I say can describe the awesomeness of these movies. I grew up watching these on VHS, now my kids (me too) can enjoy on Bluray. A must-have for adventure movie collection.",1402099200,,178,4.59375

2779628,3,B000NQRE9Q,"Good things: Packaging is solid and compact. DVDs are pretty easily extracted, although one can rip the sleeves if one isn't careful!

Bad things: On two of the discs I couldn't get the ""play movie"" option to arise. The title menu kept replaying over and over with no options. (Couldn't hit ""play movie"" ""special features"" etc.)  This COULD have been my older blue ray player, or it could be a sign of buggy discs.

Oh, and I think the BOTH the second and fourth movies are let downs. But, the star rating is for the package, not the movies.",1401840000,,541,4.444444444444445
2779629,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This set is a great addition to anyone's collection of popular action adventure movies.  The Blu-Ray quality is excellent, and it makes the viewing experience so much more satisfying than ever.",1401753600,,193,5.225806451612903

2779632,4,B000NQRE9Q,"The picture quality is pretty fantastic for as old as it is.  I'm pretty new to Blu Ray, but I can see a clear difference between this and the versions I've seen before.  The picture is sharp, colours are rich and true and it plays smooth.  Sound clarity seems improved as well.  Not as high-end as newer movies, but these were filmed in the 80s -- I'm okay with the improvements I see.

The case is odd; it's built like a book, and the 'sleeves' in which the disks sit are cardboard.  I'm not too concerned about the disks getting scratched, but it seems like an odd choice in terms of storage.  I have to wonder if it was for aesthetic or for cost-saving...",1401667200,,659,4.266129032258065

2779635,5,B000NQRE9Q,Watched these movies as a young boy.  Finally have a family of my own and enjoyed reliving the moments and introducing Indiana Jones to my six year old who loves watching Temple of Doom.,1401580800,,186,4.470588235294118
2779636,4,B000NQRE9Q,Since I think everyone over the age of 12 has seen the Indiana Jones adventures. I am therefore writing this review about the quality of the Blu-ray. I already owned the DVD version of this series and was just not happy with the picture quality. I noticed it was very grainy and brought me back to my VHS days. So when I saw Amazon had the series on Blu-ray and it was on sale I decided to check it out. First the case is outstanding. It comes it a sleeve which is always great for protection. But when I pulled the case out of the sleeve I was even more impressed. Instead of the traditional plastic case with the DVD stacked in. This opens like a book with each movie getting a two page picture guide with the Blu-ray slid into the side of the second page. This makes getting the disc in and out a little challenging but well worth it in my opinion. Overall I was extremely impressed with the quality of the Blu-ray. It was a huge improvement over the DVD and well worth every penny. I'm also pleased to say that I was unable to notice any changes to the content of the movies unlike with Spielberg's Space series... which I won't even start on that tangent but I was thrilled to notice that there was no changes to this series.... Overall the fantastic quality of not only the case but the fantastic movie quality makes this a great purchase and tempers the disappointment that the crystal skull is also included.,1401580800,,1416,4.347169811320755
2779637,5,B000NQRE9Q,Awesomeness!!!!!!! Possibly the best  hi def catalog title that has been released along with Jaws. Try to get the complete saga.,1401494400,,128,5.095238095238095
2779638,5,B000NQRE9Q,Of course these are the same movies that everyone should love but they are now in HD plus extra behind the scenes footage that hasn't been seen. A must for any fanboy of the great indy series,1401408000,,191,4.1891891891891895
2779639,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Great movies and great price (when I purchased it). I haven't watched them yet, but aside from the Chrystal Skull, I'm sure they haven't been CGIed out the ying yang, so they will be good to watch again and again.",1401408000,,213,4.35
2779640,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I have nothing negative to say about this BluRay collection.  Picture was crisp, sound quality was great, and even though it wasn't a 3D movie, it was still fun/clear to watch on my 3D TV that upgrades 2D to 3D.  There are plenty of extra features to keep you entertained after the movie is over, as well.

If you have the Star Wars Saga BluRay Collection, you will find that the Indiana Jones collection is in a similar book-style case; with art from the film on the sleeves that hold the discs.

Overall, I would highly reccomend this product to anyone who is a fan of Indiana Jones.",1401321600,,585,4.388888888888889

2779646,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Great for any fan of the movies, but also for a collector of American Cinema. Thes movies each stand alone as great adventures and have to been seen in HD. On top of that it was great price to get all in one.",1401062400,,208,3.86046511627907
2779647,5,B000NQRE9Q,"3 of the best films ever made are included in this set!  What more needs be said?  Supposedly there is a fourth film in there, but I chose not to believe it.  They stopped this series after 3 films.  I just keep telling myself that hoping it will be true.",1400889600,,255,4.04
2779648,5,B000NQRE9Q,Indiana Jones are great films like raiders and the temple of doom but the the last crusade is my favorite one but part 4 was terrible it had good acting in it but Indiana Jones movies don't have CGI in them and that's what wreaked it so the 4 one was on blu ray but the first 3 just came out last year so this set comes with 5 blu ray discs 1- 4 are the movies the 5th one is the special features stuff that wasn't seen before.,1400803200,,427,3.808988764044944

2779656,4,B000NQRE9Q,"It's hard not to run across the movies on TV from time to time, but the commercial breaks on regular cable tend to break up the rhythm of the story. Since movies on Netflix, Hulu, etc. tend to come and go, I wanted to own these for my personal satisfaction. I can say without a doubt that Raiders and Last Crusade are as good as I remembered them. Even the less impressive Temple of doom is still pretty good. If you loved the movies at the theater, buy these. It isn't the same magic but it's pretty darn close.",1400544000,,512,4.181818181818182

However, I have to come to appreciate Harrison Ford as a very entertaining actor and with some great movies to his credit.

The picture is crisp, the audio clear, and the extras disc is chock full.  There is some overlap from the original DVD release but those aren't Blu-Ray....so if you love Indiana Jones and don't have this, then you need to have this.  My only gripe, not worth a star off but worth a mention, is that the movies were not in the correct sleeves, i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark was in the Temple of Doom sleeve, Last Crusade was in Kingdom of... sleeve, etc.  Someone at the packaging facility for the film company must have not been paying attention.  Minor detail, no damage, etc.  PS, the box itself looks like the grail diary, which is pretty freakin' rad if you are a fan and a semi(mostly actually) nerd like me.",1398124800,,890,4.423312883435583

The picture quality and sound for all of these Blu-Rays is fantastic, I give them 5 stars, The only problem I have with this set is the packaging, the disc's are in very tight cardboard sleeves that can eventually scratch the disc's, so I bought a pack of Memorex DVD cases that are very inexpensive on AMAZON that are GREAT, and transferred the artwork from each movie sleeve to the new cases, it was a lot of work cutting and separating these sleeves with a razor blade, but in the end they look great and it was well worth it to be sure these fantastic movies don't get damaged. I don't know what they were thinking to package them like this, if you love these movies this is the set to buy, unless spending a few bucks more for cases and doing a little extra work is too much for you.

I will comment on the quality of the box that the movies are stored in however. I like that the movies are kept in a sort of book with the pages being the sleeves that hold the movie discs. However, it is impossible not to have to touch the surface of the discs to pull them out of the sleeves because you have to get a really good grip on the edge of the discs to be able to pull the discs out with enough force. In other words, it is not very easy to pull the discs out of the sleeves. If you don't want to leave fingerprints on the disc surface while you are pulling the discs out of the sleeves you have to use some kind of lint free cloth to grip the edge of the discs with. Another annoyance for me about this collection is the fact that you don't get any digital copies of the movies like you do if you buy the movies individually. That seems like a disservice to Indiana Jones fans that want the movies in one convenient package but also want to be able to watch the movies on their favorite portable device on the go.

The goal of updating the old serials that played in theaters was certainly achieved.

2779772,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I have been waiting a while to order this set, but most retail outlets always had it at a very high price. I own the dvd boxed set which came out a long time ago. Amazon finally had a 1 day sale for 29.99. so with tax it cam out to 32 and change which is a smoking deal for some great films.
I am looking forward to watching them for the first time in true HD picture and sound.

My order of what I think are the best films:

1. The last Crusade
2. Raiders of the lost ark
3. The temple of doom

4. I won't even mention the last film by name. If the film did not cast shia in that role and maybe used less computer generated special effects then I would find it somewhat watchable.

I do not understand why directors do not understand that classic series from people's childhoods have a very special and important nostalgic importance that should not be messed with unless you will take care to do the series justice in how you make a new addition. If one is to make a new film in a series and wants to have a chance at doing it justice then you should try and have the same feeling as the ones before it. The same could be said for the star wars series of films. I only consider the original 3 made the only ones worth watching.

Anyways. If you are a fan of Indiana jones then I can see no reason why you would not pick up this set unless you are one of those people that has to have the individual releases of each film on blu ray.",1396569600,2,1434,3.9652777777777777

This design makes it so it is a little difficult getting the disc out, but at least you don't tip the box over and all the discs pour out.

2779803,5,B000NQRE9Q,"The Indiana Jones saga is one of the greatest series of films of all time, showcasing the greatest adventurer of all time (this review is for both the films and the blu-ray box set features). Released in 1981 was Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first adventure of the heroic archaeologist Indiana Jones, who finds himself on a mission to thwart the plans of the Nazis from finding the Ark of the Covenant and using its power for evil deeds. Filled to the brim with action, laughs and even romance, Raiders is a classic that mixes B-movie elements with A-grade film-making. It wasn't long before two sequels followed suite, the first being Temple of Doom (the most over the top entry in the series) and The Last Crusade, which i would say is as good as Raiders (and bringing to the screen Sean Connery as Indy's father, Henry). Nearly twenty years later, a fourth film was made (Spielberg even said in an old interview there were supposed to be five films, to those dissenters who say the fourth film was a mistake) called Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which to this day i do not understand why people don't like it. The action was the same, the story-telling was the same, and the direction was the same, just with a great deal of CG over practical effects. Of course i will agree there were a few stupid moments (the monkeys and Shia in a few scenes), but the film itself was still a bit better than Temple of Doom. I will not say you have to like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than any of the others, but it is a better film than Temple of Doom overall.

Now, in terms of the Blu-rays themselves, the picture is much more clear, the sound is so crisp, and the special features are great. A lot of people were disappointed with the first box set because it lacked some bonus features, but this is easily one of the most complete sets for any series of films to date, having commentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, alternate/deleted scenes and other features. If you are an Indiana Jones fan, you have to get this box set. These timeless films are some that can never be remade, only remastered (even though they are trying to remake it, since Hollywood is afraid of originality).

She thought that they tried too hard and went over the top and wasn't as good but Spielberg redeemed himself with the Last Crusade.

2779830,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I love all of the Indiana Jones movies!  My favorite was The Last Crusade, followed by Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  I have the DVD version along with the Blu-ray version.  The Blu-ray version offers a huge picture quality and sound improvement.  Definitely worth the upgrade.  The discs come in sleeves, which is not ideal but not a problem for me.

I highly recommend this product.",1390780800,,428,4.64
2779831,5,B000NQRE9Q,Indy and the gang:  all 4 movies at a great price.  Marathon popcorn required. ; )  There's not much more to add.  Enjoy.,1390694400,,121,4.130434782608695

2779833,5,B000NQRE9Q,"For the pricy and quality this can't be beat.  Sure you get only 3/4 classic films, but at the very least it take minimal shelf space and allows you to do a triple feature at your own home",1390608000,,188,3.9473684210526314
2779834,5,B000NQRE9Q,I loved the first movie in this series from the beginning. It is great to get the whole set on Bluray.,1390608000,,102,3.9047619047619047
2779835,3,B000NQRE9Q,"Picture quality is good, as is the dts-HD MA audio.  However I will be returning mine seeing as how Raiders came scratched and starts skipping after the first 45 mins of the movie.  Of the 5 disks Raiders was the only one scratched, if only it had been Crystal skull...  While the flipbook that holds the disks is pretty cool looking, whoever thought that it would be a good idea to jam optical disks into cardboard should be taken out back and shot, Old Yeller style.

I would rate the product as a whole 1/5 stars, but I love the films enough that I threw in a few pitty stars.

If you decide to purchase I would carefully remove the disks from their holders (not as easy as it should be) and inspect for scratches.  Then buy a VIA elite 4 disk case (crystal skull would make a good drink coaster) for ~$2.50 and store them in there.",1390608000,,835,4.253164556962025

2779839,5,B000NQRE9Q,Never get tired of this movie. Raiders is brilliant. I don't think there is a better made movie from the first scene to the last. Look up Movie Magic and the definition is Raiders. My favorite movie of all time.,1390348800,,211,4.3

2779842,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I wish you could give 1/2 stars because I would give this 4 1/2 due to the throw away Kingdom of the Crystal Skull being part of the set. Yeah, yeah I know just one more person piling on the movie, but hey call it what it is. Outside of that, Raiders is probably the movie that gets the most juice out of the Blu Ray treatment as the colors in the opening temple scene really pop and the movie overall really cleans up well, it looks and feels so fresh. The other movies looks better due to the Blu Ray treatment, but like I said, Raiders really looks good due to it. You can spend the better part of a day going through all the bonus features and they are worth it, but if you are/were an Indiana Jones fan you've caught a bunch of them before on cable, however it's not bad to have them all together. Multi disc packaging is big with me and this one gives me reason to gripe as the movies are in individual sleeves put together kind of like book form with each sleeve being a separate page. The pages don't come out so you have to pinch the movies to pull them out of the sleeve and I hate leaving finger prints. Overall a decent buy if you catch it at a fair price.",1390089600,,1168,4.038793103448276

2779867,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Raider's of the Lost ark would individually be rated 4.5/5 stars
Temple of Doom 3/5 stars because of the high creep factor I got while watching this.
Last Crusade would easily get 5/5 stars because it's just plain awesome in nearly every way a movie can be. There's romance, action, adventure, intrigue, humor, and a few good fistfights.
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull gets about 2/5 stars if I'm feeling generous. The movie comes along 20+ years later like an unwanted child. That alone would not be reason enough to knock it, but the fact that it downright stank to high heaven is enough. It had some classic moments and some humor, but it's still just annoying and forgettable. I'm going to forget this movie happened and stick to Indiana Jones being a trilogy.

Conclusion: Definitely a worthy buy for Crusade and Raiders alone. The other hangers-on shouldn't discourage you from investing in your cultural well being.",1388793600,,920,4.859872611464968

It's the the DC+VD player because other new discs play just fine. What a disappointment. I'm returning the set for a refund. The real lesson here is to not buy these discounted sets for big savings. My suspicion is that some dealers know that the sets are defective and offer them for a big discount, getting use of the customers' money in the short term or betting on them simply not being returned.

2779906,5,B000NQRE9Q,All four are great movies. I have heard a lot of people complain about the 4th movie but I like it. My kids enjoy them too.,1386633600,,123,3.769230769230769
2779907,5,B000NQRE9Q,My youngest daughter (13 years old) did not know who Indiana Jones was so we had to order the set for her to see the great adventurer.  Classic movies. I enjoyed watching them with her.  She was not that impressed but she is only 13 years and doesn't appreciate the classics.,1386547200,,275,4.372549019607843
2779908,5,B000NQRE9Q,How could anyone complain about the greatest adventure series of all time? Not every film is at the top but you can't go wront with this collection.,1386460800,,148,4.518518518518518
2779909,5,B000NQRE9Q,"The Indiana Jones series is a tribute to the cliffhanger series of the 1930's.  The hero faces impossible odds, and hopeless situations, but in the end he wins the day.  Thats what makes these films so much fun to watch, the hero not only triumphs, but he wins the fair damsel.  What more is necessary, you have none stop action, romance, dastardly villians, everything that makes a film enjoyable.  Indiana Jones has those rugged good looks, and he is a man of action, plus he's fighting for the good old USA.  Don't worry about complicated moral issues, or some deeper meaning to these films, it doesn't exist.  Simply sit back , get you;re favorite snacks and you're best friends, and just enjoy the movie.  JRV",1386374400,,714,4.664
2779910,5,B000NQRE9Q,"There is nothing really to say.  Indiana Jones... Blu-ray.  With hours of bonus material this is an excellent addition to any collection.  Enjoyed the trilogy as a kid.  Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is... fun, I guess, but I really bought it for the original three.",1386201600,,265,4.695652173913044
2779911,5,B000NQRE9Q,We bought this for Our Grandson's for Christmas last year cause they really wanted the movie set of Indiana Jones.,1386201600,,114,4.75
2779912,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This is an awesome collection.

The first two special features on Raiders of the Lost Ark are ""new"" in the sense that they were never featured in DVD copies of the movies in the past and are like video blog documentaries on the making of the movie.

To appreciate the films fully, make sure to turn off your flat screen tv's setting of noise reduction since it creates pixels on the natural grain which can be very distracting; otherwise, you might mistakenly think that your blu-ray discs are defective. The grain was purposely left in the digital restoration of the films. Also, do not make any other adjustments to your screen's viewing mode. Keep it at the standard mode because a dynamic setting mode which combines high brightness and contrast robs the film of its authentic look.",1386201600,2,786,4.7299270072992705
2779913,5,B000NQRE9Q,"You cannot go wrong with Indiana Jones, make it look like it was shot yesterday? Even better, thank you blu-ray Indy, thank you.",1386115200,,128,4.608695652173913
2779914,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Arrived on time and as advertised (shiny and new).  The package printing has a bit of a ""bootleg"" feel to it, but the DVDs work great!",1386115200,,134,4.153846153846154
2779915,5,B000NQRE9Q,The collection is beautifully designed.  The first and third films in the series is why you want it.  It makes a great gift for someone else or for yourself.,1385942400,,157,4.379310344827586
2779916,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I'm a movie collector, plus no need to mention that those are great movies. Good picture quality, it has glitches, but then again nothing is or was meant to be perfect, plus I got the indiana jones movies on sale from amazon.",1385856000,,225,4.380952380952381
2779917,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Great set of Indiana Jones on Blu-ray ,picture quality is very good on most of the DVDs and I do not have any real complaints on this set. These are excellent  movies  and I think most people will like this release on Blu ray,it comes in a nice case too for the DVDs.",1385769600,,267,4.018867924528302
2779918,5,B000NQRE9Q,We love Indianna Jones! This is a great deal on a great package of blue-rays. Cant wait to watch them!,1385769600,,102,4.15
2779919,5,B000NQRE9Q,"She loved being able to get these movies on BluRay.  These were her second favorite next to the original Superman movies with Christopher Reeves.  These Indiana Jones movies are great (minus the last one).  I am glad that some people can find all their happiness in life in a movie series and miss the importance of human beings, all together.",1385683200,,343,4.683333333333334
2779920,5,B000NQRE9Q,"It's fantastic to have these classics in high def. The extras are not much more than the DVDs, if at all. No commentary tracks.",1385424000,,127,4.333333333333333
2779921,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Terrific video and audio transfer of one of my favorite film series.  (It's still a trilogy in my mind, but I don't mind having all of the movies together in such a comprehensive, compact and well produced package).  I think that the Raiders of the Lost Ark video transfer is not as good as the other films in the set.  That's unfortunate because it's my favorite of the films.  It is understandable because it is also the oldest movie with the lowest budget.  Having said that, it is still the best that I've ever seen the film looking and sounding (that's coming from someone who has owned versions of that movie on vhs, laserdisc and dvd).  Each of the subsequent sequels looks better than the last.  Top notch hi-def video and audio, as to be expected from a THX certified box-set.  Definitely a must-own!",1385424000,,809,4.569444444444445
2779922,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Even Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of The Crystal Skull can't take away any stars from this set because the wealth of special features combined with the absolutely beautiful transfers and remastered audio for the films themselves make this Indy set a must buy. Last Crusade looks absolutely stunning but the best looking disc of the bunch is the one you'll probably watch the least, the aforementioned Crystal Skull, being that it's the most recently released film of the four. The less we talk about that movie, the better. All the films look and sound great but from the first three films, Last Crusade has a picture that just jumps off the screen. Raiders manages to retain that Douglas Slocombe feel in its transfer and while it's not a pitch perfect transfer, it's still really, really good. I love Temple of Doom unabashedly and the picture looks pretty good also.

There's a great set of extras also and any Indy enthusiast would be pleased by what's offered here. The case is also nicely designed and represents the Indiana Jones aesthetic very well. If you want the Indy films on Blu, you probably won't get them in a better state than you do here and what is here is well done. Totally recommended.",1385337600,3,1208,4.69811320754717
2779923,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Classic Indiana the way it was meant to be.  A thrill ride from beginning to end, the movie was originally marketed as 'Return of the adventure story', it's constant thrills with no let up, and a great movie to boot.  Highly recommended!!!",1385251200,,239,4.666666666666667
2779924,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This is a great set.  While The Last Crusade has always been one of my all time favorite movies, I enjoyed all the Indiana Jones movies.  This set is a ""must have"" for any action/adventure movie watchers collection.  Even has plenty of humor thrown in too.  I definitely recommend this set.",1384992000,,290,4.627450980392157
2779925,4,B000NQRE9Q,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he was very pleased with the clarity of this blue ray version of the Indiana Jones collection.,1384992000,,137,4.111111111111111

2779930,5,B000NQRE9Q,The picture and colour on Blu Ray is great and worth the money especially with the special features on Blu Ray format. I was watching Raiders of the lost Ark on VHS tape back in 1980 and I did not like it because of the colour and picture quaility back then.,1384646400,,258,4.078431372549019

2779934,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I've been looking for the complete collection of the Indiana Jones films that feature Harrison Ford. Some of them are kinda ""B"" rated but worth having in my DVDs as part of a set and shows some of the projects that George Lucas has created.

2779939,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Honest answer - I bought this for the first 3 movies and accepted that Crystal Skull came with it. Picture quality is on point and the audio is superb. Don't let the fourth movie stop you from getting it all together, especially when you consider all that bonus footage (which matters to me).",1383004800,,292,4.528301886792453

2779943,4,B000NQRE9Q,Two of these movies (Raiders of the Lost Ark & The Last Crusade) are our favorites. Temple of Doom leaves us cold. I bought the whole collection for its  historical value.,1382659200,,171,4.516129032258065
2779944,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I've been waiting so long for this set to be released.  I preordered it as soon as I learned it was being released.  I have to say it's really great to have this on blu ray and it was almost worth the wait...because I hate waiting.

I don't know many who don't know about the Indiana Jones franchise and I'm sure there are many reviews already posted and many more reviews across the web from professionals as well, so i won't review the movies.  I bought them on blu ray because I love these movies and have watched them many times...many many times.  I still have them on worn out VHS copies if that tells you anything.

Great movies but not a fan of the packaging.  The look of it is fine.  Lots of pictures and they made it resemble a book in a slipcase.  What I don't like is that the discs are wedged inbetween these ""pages"" and are difficult to remove.  You have to get a good grip on them to pull them out which of course leads to fingerprints and possible scratches.  It's all made of cardboard so not the most sturdy of packaging either.

So movies, YAY.  Packaging, NAY.",1382572800,2,1081,4.266009852216749

This particular Limited Edition Collectors set was not available from US retailers (I got mine from Amazon UK); and I believe it might be out of print now.  So while the price may be quite high, it's only likely to continue to go up in the future.

It's a 5-disc set - one blu-ray for each of the four films, plus a bonus disc with hours of special features (many of which were taken from the DVD releases).  Regarding picture and audio quality, this is the best Indiana Jones has ever looked or sounded.  The blu-ray discs themselves are basically the same as the regular US set in terms of content -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-The-Complete-Adventures-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark-Temple-of-Doom-Last-Crusade-Kingdom-of-the-Crystal-Skull-Blu-ray/dp/B000NQRE9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures (Raiders of the Lost Ark / Temple of Doom / Last Crusade / Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) [Blu-ray</a>].

The main difference between the regular set and this Limited Edition set is that there are a lot of cool extra items added in.  The most important of which is a replica of Indy's Journal, it's a very nice leather bound booklet with Indy's drawings and imagery from the films.  I think the journal included can also be purchased separately here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Journal-of-Indiana-Jones/dp/1416563156/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones</a>

- Photo cards from the set (one from each of the productions)
- a Film Cell display with a 35mm film frame from the movie
- matchbook from Club Obi-Wan

The Indiana Jones series makes its HD debut with excellent video and audio quality. It suffers from average packaging and not all the extras from Crystal Skull are here in HD. Fortunately, the 3-hour bonus disc from the DVD set has been retained (except the storyboard galleries). There is one new extra ""On set with ROTLA"".

Special Features:
- On set with Raiders of the Lost Ark: Witness the making of Raiders as it happened with newly revealed footage that puts you on the set during production, alongside filmmakers, cast and crew.
- Film Foursome: The ""Making of"" all 4 Indiana Jones Adventures: Join filmmakers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for an up-close look at each production, and the evolution of the original action hero, Indiana Jones.
- Cast and Creator Interviews
- Behind-the-Scenes Peeks: Stunts, Sounds, Special Effects and more!

Buy this BR collection. This is a must-have for fans of the franchise because it is a definite upgrade over the DVD releases in almost every way. My only complaint is that there are no deleted scenes. The 2-season, 28 episode television series The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones isn't included either.",1376870400,,1260,4.883177570093458

This is the ultimate collection for action/adventure fans of all ages and the series promises to provide many movie nights, appropriate for the whole family's viewing enjoyment!

2779988,1,B000NQRE9Q,"I'm a stickler for video quality.  What I noticed on the first disc ""Raider's of the Lost Ark""; the transfer is not a very good one.  Blu Ray usually looks crisp and though it's a film transfer, here they failed big time.  There are times when there background looks out of focus and I'm not talking cool film out of focus, it's out of focus due to the transfer.  I have these on dvd and I would venture that the DVD probably looks clearer then some of the weird focus issues with this transfer.  Also, even in the clear picture frames, it's not as clean looking, this goes beyond the Film clarity, so something is definitely wrong here.
I'd wait for the next clean up of these movies.",1376438400,14,685,4.3203125

The only reason why I gave even one star s is the fact the blu ray quality is great, so much better than the last DVD set released. I am so disappointed in the fact this set is manufactured in a cheap, paper and cardboard case. The discs are extremely hard to get out of the cardboard sleeves. This is a disgrace that Lucas did not spend the time and extra care to package correctly in some sort of collector plastic case, rather than the cheap and low class cardboard and paper.  Since the only way to get these movies on bluray, it is probably best to get this set as I have heard it might be a while, or never, they can be obtained otherwise. I was so anxious to receive and probably missed other reviews talking about the inferior packaging. The price was ok, but just a huge disappointment with the packaging.",1376006400,17,883,4.287425149700598

I don't have any regrets in buying it again. The details in sound and video are stunning and are worthy of the HD treatment. If you're a fan of the movies, and don't have it on blu-ray, buy it. The quality of the movies themselves have been debated to death and the last one (Crystal Skull) arguably is the worst one in the bunch.  As a long time Indy fan, I would like to see Indy in the Fedora hat one last time. This time, in a movie that is comparable to the great Raiders of Lost Ark.

This Blu-Ray collection takes our adventurer to a new level of appreciation, beginning with a wonderful backstory on the 5th disc.  Sometimes it is almost as fascinating as the film it is describing!  I sure hope there is no arguing about this version and that version and so on, because all seems to be nicely intact and theatrically correct -- if that's a big point.  I myself just revel in seeing things again for the first time!  I can take the dark with the light, the comedy with the drama, and most of all the homage to the great films of a bygone era...  If you have been out of this country for the past almost half a century, then you might not be familiar with these films; in which case I suggest this very nice set of up-to-date technological discs to get you in the mood for fun and adventure.  It's what we got to the movies for!  And if you are lucky enough to have a 4-foot or wider flat screen TV at home, all you need is some popcorn and someone to share the fun with!",1375228800,,1065,4.186274509803922

Naturally, we were past the return window by 1 week.  And Amazon makes it impossible to return/replace items.  Frustrated.  This item was new, in-box.

2780008,5,B000NQRE9Q,"it is still one of the best movies experience you can have, and even if it has quite an old look, specially in the first one, it does look great in dvd. and the visual effects are just right.
Raiders of the Lost Ark, is a case study on the modern blockbuster. it shows how to introduce a character right, how they can still be human, and even be a little prick. Dont read Save the Cat, study this film instead and the script, and you will know what makes a good movie, a block buster and specially what today's action summer flicks are missing, how to make the movie keep making money for generations, and not b e forgotten in the first summer.
The temple of doom, is an okay movie, the new characters are really annoying and shows how personal life can affect a filmmakers vision of a film.
The Lost Grail is a good movie, and has quite interest action pieces. also the characters are better defined, specially the villains, compared to the previous film.
The Crystal Skull, could have been a respectable movie, but to be honest My feeling in this movie is that the sensibilities of Spielberg and Lucas collided all over the place, and didn't let the storytelling be what drove the movie. I specially feel that Lucas is  the cause of most of the films bad action sequences, that seems to be just there to be funny and different and showcase CGI, the way the Star wars prequel were made.
In overall, i recommend the box set, these are just the representation of a classic character in some very good movies, with very highs and lows but still worth examining. specially by comparing the scripts and story behind each one.",1375056000,,1621,4.457912457912458
2780009,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I am commenting on the packaging, since I haven't watched them yet.  I picked this set up after having it on my wish list since before last Christmas.  I happened to catch it on a day when the price was the lowest I had seen it so far.  Maybe they are going to change up the packaging or something, but I jumped on the price!  It's usually around fifty bucks but I got it for about 25% less.

It has probably been noted, but the Blu-ray discs are each in a cardboard sleeve of a book-like insert.  It's cute and compact, but in order to get the disc out you have to grab it and pull.  There is no way to keep from getting fingerprints on it!  Unless you wear gloves.

These are all time favorite movies with Harrison Ford!!  How can you go wrong?  I had the set in VHS, but figured it was time to upgrade.",1375056000,,805,4.031645569620253
2780010,3,B000NQRE9Q,"I have seen the Indiana Jones series in just about every format made.
  I give an overall rating of 4 stars for PQ and 4.5 stars for AQ.
  PQ- I believe that as much has been done (that can be done) considering many shots
  on Raiders were just plain ""out-of-focus"". The PQ gets progressively better with the newer
  films.

  AQ- It seems that an extra effort has been made to ""Juice-up"" the soundtrack..sometimes to the point of overpowering the dialog.
  I recommend defeating the Main R&L so the center channel can shine. To me, Multi-Channel Stereo sounds better than the lossless HiDef sound codec.
  I not surprised...there's not much you can do when movie audio was in it's infancy back then.

  PACKAGING- The packaging was poorly designed. Even if you ""squeeze"" the cardboard to try to get it out the sleeve,
  you still have to grab the vulnerable part of the disc-guaranteeing at least thick smudges and
  even nail scratches since it requires so much force to get the disc out.

There's no deleted scenes either (not even the 28 seconds mentioned in big bang theory?), but deleted scenes wasn't enough for the updated haters to buy star wars so I'll just review the movies!

Raiders of the Lost Ark was the film that started it all! Harrison Ford plays Archaeologist Indiana Jones in search for the Ark from Bible myth! He finds out it's real! Nazies in this film are his competition!

The Temple of Doom is a prequel set a year before Raiders of the Lost Ark! I'm surprised at how many people give negative reviews to this film! The heart removal invented the PG-13 rating! Indy looks for sacred stones with a goonie and the director's wife!

The Last Crusade has James Bond playing his father! They look for the Holy Grail! This film has the dwarf from Lord of the Rings reprise his role from Raiders of the Lost Ark!

Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is watchable! Karen Allen from Raiders of the Lost Ark reprises her role! Instead of looking for treasure, Indy must return a crystal skull to it's rightful place!",1375056000,,1136,4.603960396039604

I'm sure most of us with a taste for adventure films have seen the movies countless times so why was I interested in buying this set you may ask? Although the LaserDisc was great for its time that time has passed and I wanted to see how the latest permutations were looking and sounding and I wasn't disappointed.

If you have not seen these movies by some stretch of the imagination, you do have a treat in store if you have any interest in classic adventure films. Harrison Ford was in his prime when the series started and he seemed to hold up adequately all the way through the last one.

2780059,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Most everyone reading this will be familiar with the movies already.  Personally I think the first three are great, and the fourth mediocre.  I do not hate Crystal Skull like others.  Certainly do not hate it enough to be insulted that it is included in this set like some others are.  Yes, I think parts of it were stupid.  Not even the alien part because lets face it all the movies have an element of supernatural to them (melting faces, instant mummification etc) but the things that bothered me were surviving a nuclear blast in a lead lined fridge, surviving said fridge being thrown for miles, swinging through the jungle to cover miles in a couple minutes and so on.  At least in the first three films the non-supernatural aspects were plausible, none of the ""real life"" things in crystal skull came off as even remotely believable.  There were some comedic moments and references to the old films though that if you do watch it are worth a chuckle.  I agree that it did not need to be made, and had all the hallmarks of Lucas trying to be too clever with the story, but they made 4 movies, and of course it was going to be included in this set.

The audio and video quality of the restorations of the other movies are very good.  Given when they were filmed (especially Raiders and Temple of Doom), there is only so much that could be done to get the video quality up for the blu ray transfer.  There are still some blurry and grainy portions of the older films, but I think they have looked the best they ever have on video or DVD.  Of course crystal skull has the best AV quality, but also has the most amount of special effects and green screen sequences.

The bonus disc is full of great behind the scenes and bonus material.  There is a new on set with Raiders of The Lost Ark feature, then the same features that were included in the DVD set put out years ago with the original three movies.  Personally I think it was worth it to upgrade from that version to the Blu Rays.  If you absolutely hate the fourth movie and want nothing to do with it, and are fine with having the original three, then you probably want to either wait until the discs are available in blu ray, or just stick with the original DVD set.",1372723200,,2227,4.3559322033898304

2780093,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Why bother reviewing the films themselves when you can find that kind of info over at IMDb? Let's look at the actual physical product:

All three movies look pretty fantastic in high definition. I can see some of what people are complaining about with ""Raiders,"" but honestly, it's still leaps and bounds ahead of where we were with our VHS copy twenty years ago. I love the clarity and depth of picture that allows me to see even the pores on Marcus Brody's face. The audio mix brings Williams' score a new breath of life that adds richness to the overall experience.

And what's more, the three films include a disc of bonus features and a mini frisbee that can double as a coaster or, with some imagination, a throwing star.

My one complaint is the packaging. Whoever decided that sliding a disc in and out of its casing is a safe way to handle media is fooling themselves. I'm sure it will be a while before these discs get so scratched that they are unwatchable, but seriously, if I'm forking out more than $30 for a set of films, I better feel pretty secure about their future viewability.",1372636800,,1096,4.49748743718593

2780103,4,B000NQRE9Q,"First of all. these are great movies transferred onto Blu-ray with excellent sound. Watching these movies again now in HD with THX sound makes for great viewing.

Since I already like these movies (as probably most people here) I won't go into the content of the movies. Besides, there are plenty of true movie reviews available on actual movie review sites. I will rate the product (movies as well as format and quality) I received.

This ""boxed"" set is exactly that...a cardboard boxed set with a pull-out DVD holder. It is firm quality (strong) cardboard with smooth coated inserts for the DVDs. The movies are a pretty good transfer considering the age of the originals. The sound quality really enhances the enjoyment of these movies.

Overall, I am very happy having these Indy movies on Blu-ray in my collection. I don't think you will be disappointed either especially if you already like Indiana Jones.

Although I love the movies (I even like Crystal Skull), I rate the entire product only 4 stars because it's not perfect and does not have as much ""extra"" information as I had hoped. Also, oddly,  these DVDs do not resume play where I left off if I turn my DVD player off and then back on again while the disc is in the tray.",1371600000,,1237,4.63013698630137

The only indication that it's BluRay is a piece of printed cardboard that is laid over the container.
It fell off once the cellophane was removed.
No where else is there any reference to this movie being BluRay.
And the video quality shows it.
It is either a very poor transfer or it's nothing but a fake.
At the start of the movie there is a 2 second screen shown that says something about it being HD, but nothing about BluRay.
The color is rendered worse than an old Laser Disc I also own.

2780139,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Raiders of the Lost Ark 4.5/5

I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and the big screen (in old 35mm prints and in IMAX). Each time they have been sold-out. I can't think of many films that still sell-out 30 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.

The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the clich and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck, or the sword/gun fight.

I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well...no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey, and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.

The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.

The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of today's movies.

You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars!

I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fifth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to after the travesty of KOTCS. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show, which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).

I am giving Raiders 4.5/6 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 5/5 movie) as I often prefer darker and/or critically undermined sequels. Even 32 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 32 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.

Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 5/5

Set before the events of 'Raiders', Dr. Jones is in Shanghai doing business with Chinese crime boss Lau Che. Losing the upper hand in a night club he barely escapes with his life (and baggage in the form of Willie Scott and sidekick kid Short Round) to the airport. But little does he know the plane he gets on is owned by Lau Che and the pilots sneak out in mid-air while they are sleeping.

After jumping to safety in an inflatable dinghy Indy, Willie, and Short Round drift by an Indian village that has been stricken with bad luck since the theft of their magical Sankara stones. Encouraged by the villagers to go to Pankot palace and retrieve the stones, Indy has no idea that what he will find involves an evil cult hell-bent on taking over the world with their lunatic new religion.

Temple of Doom is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Indiana Jones film. I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker, nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word 'go'! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another. The opening musical number, the fight in the Obi-Wan Club, the chase through Shanghai, the plane crash/dingy ride, the journey to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene, the human sacrifice, the freeing of the slaves, the mine-cart ride, the water rush, the rope bridge, the cliff-hanging...wow! How much more can you pack into a film? It's physically impossible!

Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark, Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic. I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else. If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America, no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody.

John Williams' brilliant music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is quite rare. The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects (beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters) which, when viewed today, at least might seem a little bit dated, but still hold up quite well.

Or course, there's nothing really important about the film. I mean it won't beat Schindler's List or Munich in terms of drama but if you want escapism and soaring, thrill-a-minute adventure his name is Indiana Jones and the place is the Temple of Doom.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade 3.5/5

Summer 1989. I was 8 years old. I only managed 2 movies that summer, one being Ghostbusters 2 (which blew my eager young mind at the time) and Last Crusade (which also blew my mind). I don't think I could have asked for two bigger blockbusters to choose from. Having been a rabid child fan of Raiders and Temple of Doom all things Indy were fresh in my mind and even as an 8-year-old I truly 'got' Last Crusade.

Set 2 years after Raiders, and 3 years after Temple of Doom, Last Crusade opens with a flashback to Indy's youth and an aggravating cameo by River Phoenix in the role. His anachronistic hair, androgynous physiognomy, and that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like Harrison Ford take me out of the film every time, and spoils the long opening scene for me. The opening does nothing apart from establish all of Indy's trademarks (the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes), which he apparently all got within five minutes. Luckily the film soon jumps forward to 1938 and the opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector Walter Donovan encourages Indy to go after the Holy Grail.

With Der Fuhrer also after the sacred chalice Indy must once again face off against the despicable Nazis, rescue his bumbling father (Sean Connery, having the time of his life), and keep one step ahead of Donovan with Sallah and Brody tagging along.

There is loads of inventive, exciting action in many exotic, breath-taking locations and all of it is immaculately photographed by Douglas Slocombe in lovely anamorphic Panavision. Even with today's many advancements in movie camera technology you'll rarely see a film as beautifully photographed as this. All very high-key, mind you, the polar opposite of the dark, subterranean Temple of Doom.

Now, herein lies my only gripe with Last Crusade (other than River Phoenix) is the fact that it's just too light-hearted. Spielberg expressed regret over the fact that he made Temple of Doom very dark and mean-spirited (which I don't agree with as it is my personal favorite) so he compensated by making Last Crusade more cheerful and bright. It's not an annoying shift in tone, but it could have been balanced out with a bit more blood and gore.

Last Crusade makes the perfect end to the real Indiana Jones trilogy. Spielberg really should have left it as our hero, his dad, and his two sidekicks rode off into the sunset. How can you top that? How can you come back from that? But 19 years later he tarnished many reputations and spoiled many memories with the deeply, DEEPLY misjudged Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

It was an amazing film to see as a child, and it's a shame that kids these days are not exposed to anything as good. If you can turn a blind eye to River Phoenix you will surely have a great time with Last Crusade. It's not the Snake Car on the train he ought to worry about, it's the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 1.5/5

14 syllables in that title!

What an immense disappointment this film was. After 19 years of waiting we deserved something better. I can't imagine what Spielberg was thinking when he threw this film together. It's a long, long way from the previous instalments in the franchise.

Harrison Ford looks bored out of his mind, and who wouldn't be? It's not that he's too old or anything it's just that there is nothing much for him to do apart from spew loads of exposition (the previous films kept this to a minimum). Up until this instalment every Indy film had several key, iconic scenes. Be it a tumbling rock or a mine car chase there was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.

The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up Die Hard 4 the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.

Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark and grainy photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.

I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the very poor script is nonsensical and circular, frequently using the titular skull as a tedious MacGuffin to push through any difficulties when the plot paints itself into a corner. It plain and simple doesn't make any sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script bloated with leftover scenes from Tomb Raider video games and abandoned puzzles from Channel 4's 1990s adventure show The Crystal Maze.

Ray Winstone, as Mac, is the worst character in the film, there is so much wrong with Mac. His motivations and personality make me wince like chewing tin foil. Jim Broadbent, also hopelessly miscast, as a replacement for the late Denholm Elliot, is underwritten. His resignation at the beginning has no weight to it. We've just met the character, why should we care if he resigns to get Indy a paid suspension (a detail that is immediately forgotten)? Karen Allen returns as Marion but has next to nothing to do apart from drive a car-boat and tag along with the already bloated cast. Indy, Mutt, Mac, Ox and Marion all searching for an ancient treasure while being pursued by (a gorgeous) Cate Blanchett. My God is this ain't the friggin' Goonies, man.

Despite the PG-13 rating it is probably the tamest Indy film yet. Look at the final scene in Raiders with the exploding heads and melting faces. How brilliant and timeless is that? It's pure imagination mixed with great make-up effects and it's a finale that everyone remembers. Irina Spalko (who does not one evil thing in the whole movie) meets an altogether much lazier fate. I won't ruin it for you despite already having given most of the ending away but I will say that it's quick and unaffecting and looks like it came out of a video game. You'll completely forget it 2 seconds after it happens.

When all else fails you could usually turn to John Williams for comfort. Sorry folks, but Williams (along with everyone else, it seems) is strictly phoning it in for this one. His themes are lazy, boring and instantly forgettable. Don't expect anything as awesome as 'Parade of the Slave Children' or 'Desert Chase' here. The Ark of the Covenant theme can be heard near the start but all the new material is as bland as it can get.

Indy IV should never have happened. At this point in his career Steven Spielberg is just surrounded by Yes Men. Paramount wanted a new Indy movie and cut him way too much slack. Raiders was shot very quickly, with a devil-may-care attitude, giving it a rough, grainy edge that worked only in his favor. Spielberg fought against many comprises and still delivered a classic. Now, after years of final cuts, after so many CGI quick fixes, with no outside forces curbing his excess, he's gone soft, and fat, and he's completely lost his edge.

Spielberg has lost it. And this unnecessary film is the proof.

All four movies are presented in virtually perfect 2.35:1 1080p HD with near faultless DTS HD-MA 5.1 sound. The older movies look brilliant, especially some of the higher-key effects shots. You'll swear some of it was shot yesterday. However, I did notice some weird anomalies surrounding the tarantulas on Alfred Molina at the start of Raiders. Not sure if it is a problem on my end, but it is odd as Raiders had a massive restoration prior to release.

Each individual disc only has a couple of trailers (there are no commentaries) with the bulk of the extras on Disc 5. Some of the extras from the 2008 KOTCS disc are absent, but I doubt anyone will really care about that.

The other extras are as follows:

On Set with Raiders of the Lost Ark

An hour-long documentary in 1080p with lots of B-roll footage and deleted scenes in 1080p. All is presented in chronological order as Spielberg strives his way through the shoot. Very interesting stuff.

Making the Films:

The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

A great hour-long, Emmy-winning documentary shot on 16mm featuring on location interviews and insights into the making of virtually every part of the movie. The kind of honest, raw movie doc that you just don't get anymore.

Unfortunately the focus seems to be on Raiders here, as the original, hour-long documentary of Temple of Doom (directed by Frank Marshall, nonetheless) is not featured on the disc.

The Making of Temple of Doom (2003)

A 41-minute retrospective documentary fills in for Frank Marshall's superior vintage doc. It uses a lot of Marshall's 16mm behind-the-scenes footage.

The Making of the Last Crusade (2003)

A 35-minute retrospective documentary featuring 16mm shot on location at the time. Sean Connery appears in interview and River Phoenix and Denholm Elliott appear on location discussing their roles. It's pretty good, and you can feel Spielberg's zeal for the movie even many years after it came out.

The Making of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)

Spielberg explains why he thought tarnishing Indy's legacy with an extremely poor sequel was a good idea to begin with. It lasts for 28 minutes, which is time you can spend doing something more productive, like cleaning out the bowl of a public toilet with a three-haired toothbrush and some spit.

Behind-the-scenes:

The Stunts of Indiana Jones - a 10-minute piece detailing how the pulled off some of the action. It's quite superficial but covers many of the main set-pieces.

The Sound of Indiana Jones - a 13-minute piece featuring the work of Ben Burtt, the sound designer for the Indy movies. Burtt himself explains how he came up with all of the effects. Interesting if you practice this kind of thing.

The Music of Indiana Jones - 12-minute piece with interviews with John Williams and Steven Spielberg. There is a lot of old footage showing them working together with Williams explaining his logic behind the music.

The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones - 12-minute piece focusing on ILM and the special effects of the movies, back when everything was either done in-camera or optically, which I refer to ""the good old days"" before CGI wrecked E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.

Raiders: The Melting Face! - an 8-minute piece detailing the famous melting face of Toht as he witnesses the Wrath of God in Raiders. Chris Walas (who's career was ruined by the advent of CGI) was the man responsible and is featured in an interview.

Indiana Jones and the Creepy Crawlies - a 12-minute feature (with optional pop-up trivia) detailing the snakes, bugs, and rats of the first three movies. It seems to have been shot during the shoot for KOTCS judging by the clothes of the actors interviewed.

Travel with Indiana Jones: Locations - a 10-minute piece detailing all of the locations and stand-in locations around the world where the movies were filmed. Again it features a pop-up trivia track and appears to be filmed during the shoot for KOTCS.

Indy's Women: The American Film Institute Tribute - a 9-minute feature with Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw, and Allison Doody on stage discussing their characters before an audience. Shot in 2003.

Indy's Friends and Enemies - a 10-minute piece detailing all of his sidekicks and recurring characters. It covers a lot of the same ground as the previous featurette as half of it is about Indy's girlfriends.

Iconic Props - a superficial 10-minute piece detailing MacGuffins and famous wardrobes from all four movies. Too much focuses on KOTCS. The Ark of the Covenant barely gets a look-in while time is spent on Shia LeBeouf's comb?

The Effects of Indy - a 22-minute piece focusing on the timeless optical effects of the first three movies (for about 30 seconds) and the garish, ugly CGI of the fourth for the rest of the running time. They actually spend time on discussing the prairie dog nonsense from KOTCS!

Adventures in Post Production - a 12-minute piece detailing the post-production of KOTCS. If you care about this film then go for it. I personally find anything to do with it very difficult to sit through.",1369526400,4,19240,4.648306332842416

2780149,4,B000NQRE9Q,"The title says it all. The movies are great. I got this because I really wanted the first three movies on blu-ray.  And it was a great deal. The quality of the picture is pretty good.  The only complaint I have about this set is the box itself.  It has this terrible sleeve system that is a pain to get the movies out, and you have to grab the flat side of the disc to get them out, which is stupid design to say the least.  I give the movies a 5/5 and the case a 1/5.  I haven't watched the bonus features yet so I can't talk about those.  I would say only consider buying this if you can get it for a good deal. I'm considering pulling all the movies out and putting them in a different case.",1368316800,,694,3.9214285714285713
2780150,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This Blu Ray is wonderfully transitioned over. The picture is great, but the sound quality is what really impressed me, its so clear sounding and crisp. Comes in a nice cardboard box, that flips like a book to hold all your discs. A great collection for any Indiana Jones fan",1368316800,,275,4.52

2780153,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Why are you reading this when you could be watching the series right now?  Everyone has an opinion about this series of films, whether you agree that the first one was a great cinematic achievement, or that the fourth installment was worthy of the hate, but there is no doubt that this set is a wonderful one to own.  When I buy compilations of movies like this, I expect to get more than a set of discs in a generic case.  Fans of a series of movies, are what make it possible for the films to live on from generation to generation.  If you can't reward us with some cool behind the scenes footage and/or artwork, then it comes as a bit of a slap in the face.  I am happy to say that this set does not do that.  The transfer to Blu-ray looks amazing.  I don't have a decent surround sound setup at home, as mine is an antique, but it does sound good on my system.  If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones stuff, you probably already own this series in some form, but if you want it on Blu-ray, this is a great choice.",1368057600,,1016,4.045

2780159,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series, so of course I enjoyed the blurays.

The DVD's (and everything) look just like new. I had VCR tapes of the first three Indiana Jones movies, but had to throw them away--they literally disintegrated. Now I've got the complete set and am quite pleased. This Amazon seller carries great products and provides great service.",1366502400,,415,4.859154929577465

2780167,3,B000NQRE9Q,"The First movie was slow but real good. The second was not as slow but not as good. After that they were good but not spectacular. Still if you like more than one of them, might as well get the collection - it costs about the same as buying just a couple of them. If my husband is watching the first one, I'll watch it with him, the others he watches by himself.",1366156800,,362,3.9726027397260273

I did notice a strange out-of-focus sequence in ""The Last Crusade"" when all of the main characters are riding together in a convertible.  It only lasts a few seconds, but I don't remember this problem on the DVD release.  When Amazon puts collections like this on sale for 60% off retail, you simply can't pass them up.",1365379200,,377,4.681818181818182

2780191,5,B000NQRE9Q,"The coveted Blu Ray collection for me. Having all four movies on Blu Ray is great.

Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, the color correction on it almost made it feel like I was watching the movie for the first time.  There were so many small details I missed the previous (many) times I've seen this film in theater, broadcast television, vhs, and dvd.

My ONLY complaint is the extras.  I want more.  I know there's a lot more extras out there (The original PBS broadcast of 'Making of' is missing for one) but other than that, there's still lots of extras with scenes I've never seen before, such as the deleted scene of Harrison holding onto the submarine's periscope) Don't get me wrong, I loved all the extras offered...I'm just being greedy.",1363910400,,746,4.578947368421052

I don't understand why movie studios can't manage to fill up the full screen in these Blu-Ray releases on HD when somehow HBO doesn't seem to have any problems filling up the full screen when you watch movies on cable/FiOS.

Other than that the picture looks fine.",1363737600,,393,4.507042253521127

2780199,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I have always loved these movies which obviously why I purchased this set. I wanted to address the packaging woes some have expressed. I personally think the packaging is pretty good. It is a sturdy cardboard boxed set. Where the cardboard meets the business side of the disk it has a glossy smooth texture which shouldn't harm the disks. Some have said that the pockets are very tight and nearly impossible to get the disks out. Mine holds the disks snugly enough to keep them from falling out but allows me to slide them out with little or no resistance. The only one that resisted at all was the pocket for the bonus disk and it was only slight.

This leads me to think that some folks may have gotten sets that came from a batch of defective boxes where perhaps too much glue was used in the packaging making them much tighter than they should be. Sometimes things like this happens to a whole batch of items. I bought a movie several years ago I had to return to the store three or four times because I kept getting copies where the bonus features didn't have any audio.

I am sorry for those who got bad packaging, but mine for one turned out good. So hopefully if you buy this set yours will too. Good luck!",1363132800,5,1214,4.343612334801762

2780221,5,B000NQRE9Q,"The Indiana Jones Franchise remains one of the most engrossing, thoroughly wholesome, wildly entertaining family experiences one can have at the movies. A crowning example of big budget Hollywood film-making at its best, this series justifies the unique hold American movies have on the world's imagination.

There is never a moment in any of these movies where one waits to be entertained. Every sequence develops character and plot through catchy dialogue and/or great action sequences. The character and his adventures remain readily accessible to people of all cultures and the franchise represents one of the best examples of creatively brilliant, sheer entertainment.

Messrs. Stephen Spielberg, George Lucas and their creative teams rightly merit all the accolades they have earned for this series of films and leading man Mr. Harrison Ford deserves special mention for his iconic portrayal worthy of America's great tradition of on screen heroes.

This collection is an excellent addition to the living rooms of homes that look forward to family time in front the TV watching great movies together.",1361750400,,1106,5.4186046511627906

Pros
1. All movies are all on blu ray, certified with the best quality assurance
2. The movies are clearer than I can remember them. I've seen the VHS editions a lot of times.
3. The sound is top notch. A lot of the time I had to turn the volume down
4. The approx. 6 hours of bonus features are priceless. They have all the bonus features from the DVD editions plus brand new ones that cover the production of all four movies
5. The trinkets if you can't see from the pictures include:
A. Condensed version of The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones
B. Five production pictures
C. A book of matches from Club Obi Wan
D. Film cell from Indy's encounter with the cobra
E. Two tickets to the Zepplin from Last Crusade
F. Ticket to the Pan Am Clipper in Raiders

I like the book style case, which usually I am not a big fan of, but this version is put together in a very interesting manner. It has colorful maps and photos between each holder for the disc.

2780229,4,B000NQRE9Q,"These movies are a wonderful ""romp"", which I don't think one should take too seriously, as that was the intent of the producers, directors and stars. All four movies look and sound good enough to enjoy on good home entertainment  gear.

You know the movies, so there's no need to discuss those details any further. In my opinion, the Nazi villain movies are better than the non-Nazi villains. If you loved them, as I still do, they are wonderful, and I actually found more to enjoy in the second film (Temple of Doom) -- always loved the start of that movie, but felt it trailed off.

Color transfer appears uniformly good on a 51-inch Plasma picture, and sound is adequately loud and clear on TFX Certified surround sound equipment. Special effects, while appropriate to the vintage of the movies, are far more ""noticeable"" in the older movies -- the first two. Last Crusade and Kingdom of Skulls, especially, show how far CGI has advanced.

I didn't find the included special features (which if you've got older DVD sets, you probably already own) to increase the enjoyment of the movies. The video quality of the special features is not very good, and looks it on modern video equipment. That said, IMO, the set's a bargain for HD television, but you probably won't use it to show off your equipment to your friends. Nonetheless, I recommending getting some popcorn and ordering some pizza, and inviting some good friends (old and young) over to watch these movies. They just seem to go better in an audience, as they were made to be seen.

A friend of mine had the same issue and we both had to return our copies for replacements.  Make sure you test all of your discs when you get them to ensure that they all work, as it appears there were some bad pressings on the initial first-run release of this set.

2780241,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I am enjoying the films in HD, but they are extremely difficult to remove from the packaging without touching the underside of the discs.  The star wars set has enough of the disc showing that you can grab it from the center and edge, but on this set they are completely inside the cardboard and you really have to just grab the disc and pull it out of the sleeve, leaving fingerprints and possibly scratches.  The packaging is beautifully done other than this factor.
  I like the look of the PQ and the fact that raiders retains more of its theatrical look, though some have complained about the remaster. Other films look great to me as well, but it would be better if they could have digitally removed kate capshaw from temple of doom.
  The movies sound great as well, and at the end of Raiders I felt that I was actually there during the face melting scene.  Thank God they didn't do any digital ""enhancements"" to this or any other scene.  The effects hold up extremely well and look worlds better than any cartoonish cgi garbage they would likely replace it with. You don't mess with a masterpiece.",1360800000,,1105,4.517587939698492

I'm just going to simply say that this is the very nearly the definitive version of the Indiana Jones Anthology, and there is a load of extra features with interviews, behind the scenes footage, and featurettes. The transfer of a 30 year old film to Blu Ray is amazing and the 5.1 audio is spot on and improves on previous releases. The only reason that it is merely very nearly the definitive version is because there is no commentary for any of the movies.",1360713600,,627,4.648648648648648

2780244,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Anyone old enough to be reading reviews on Amazon.com is likely familiar w/ the Indiana Jones movies & even more likely . . . they already have an opinion of these movies . . . I am no different and this experience hasn't swayed my opinion of the movies . . . that being said, I have the following feedback regarding my 'attempt' at purchasing this Blu-Ray set:

1) There appears to be much criticism regarding the packaging of this product . . . and based on my experience w/ this product, I'd have to agree  . . . as it appears as though my first disc (Raiders) was in fact scratched/rubbed or in some way damaged in such a manner that the movie 'froze' on several occasions during the viewing.  So, this is one reason I'm returning this product as I won't purchase Blu-Rays in these card board casings that encourage rubbing on the information side of the disc.

2) I realize that a movie released in 1981 and transferred to Blu-Ray format in recent years can not be expected to have the same quality as a movie being released today (say something like The Avengers).  However, even w/ some concessions in mind . . . I was still greatly disappointed w/ the quality of the transfer of the 1st movie . . . Granted, my knowledge of such matters is very limited; but I am a consumer & avid movie-goer . . . and I can tell you this first movie (Indiana Jones Raiders) greatly disappointed me.  Side Note: for those interested in my AV/HT chain; the following was my AV-setup used in watching this movie: Samsung 55C8000 LED TV; Oppo BP-103; Denon 4311ci & Paradigm Studio 100's 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System.  Unlike ""The Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" . . . The Avengers was OUTSTANDING on my AV/HT system . . . & don't get me wrong; I'm not praising ""The Avengers"" as the 'end-all-be-all' . . . just trying to make a comparison for a frame of reference.

3) The provider of this Blu Ray box set was CDImports.  I contacted CDImports regarding my displeasure w/ how long it took for this order to be received, processed & delivered (11 days) . . . trying to understand how such an order could take so long to process . . . and asking for understanding, they basically responded (robo-responded would be more accurate) w/ ""if you're not pleased w/ the service you've received; feel free to exercise your right to return your product."" . . . Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that I was able to return this product  . . . but (IMO) the only thing worse than 'inflexible customer service' is 'customer service that isn't interested in process improvement' & responding thoughtfully to my inquiries. . .

Anyway, I can't really offer feedback on the movies . . . as I don't believe my opinion on the movies would affect anyone's future intent to purchase this product; but hopefully, the above items will assist someone in making a more well informed purchasing decision.

There are no cracks or pops in the soundtrack that I could pick up at all, which was certainly not the case with my original DVD copies (goodness, how bad was that copy of Holy Grail?!?) and the picture was really well restored. The packaging was really well done too. I am super pleased with this collection!

If I were to have a complaint, it would be that I didn't find the bonus content as enjoyable as I have with other collections that I have picked up from Paramount, but I'm likely in the minority. I would have been more excited about a full commentary track instead of the snippets of set footage, but that is 100% personal preference.",1360281600,,722,4.428571428571429

The only issue is the bonus features are mostly from the standard DVD set which came out in 2003 and they look a bit harsh in Hi Def for some reason, but that's a very minor criticism.

All fans should be paid to watch the trainwreck that is KotCS. It should be noted that these movies are amazing in blu-ray. Buying the traditional format DVDs and going through upconversion doesn't do these movies justice. The digital re-formatting has brought new life to each of these movies.

2780281,5,B000NQRE9Q,I bought this as a gift for my father who LOVES Indiana Jones! He really loved the movies and the set was well-packaged. It made a really nice gift.,1358812800,,148,4.137931034482759

2780284,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I've noticed complaints from other customers that this Indiana Jones blu-ray collection houses the discs in cardboard sleeves.  That's true, and it is unfortunate, but for $40, I'm not complaining.  I'll leave it others to review the films and the blu-ray transfers, and will simply offer an easy solution to the cardboard sleeve dilemma:

I'd already purchased the Indiana Jones DVD collection a few years ago (from which ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is absent), so when this blu-ray collection arrived I simply took out the old DVD set, opened up each film's clamshell case one-by-one, and stuck a CD/DVD adhesive hub on the inside left of each case (you can get 100 of these fellows for $9 at Amazon, just search for ""Clear CD Hub Center with Adhesive Backing"").  With the hubs attached, I moved the DVDs from the clamshell hubs onto the new hubs on the left, then carefully slipped the blu-ray discs from their pesky cardboard sleeves and stuck them on the clamshell hubs.  ""Crystal Skull"" and the special feature discs are housed in the DVD special feature clamshell case, which is totally fine with me, since I don't like ""Crystal Skull"" anyway.  If one doesn't wish to purchase these adhesive hubs, one can buy clamshell cases that accommodate 4, 6, even 8 DVDs.

It's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness -- or the cardboard sleeves!",1358640000,2,1358,4.802575107296137
2780285,5,B000NQRE9Q,I have been a big fan of Indiana Jones since I was a teenager and this bluray upgrade really makes these movies a leasure to watch again. The playback even on the original movie is outstanding.,1358640000,,193,4.388888888888889
2780286,3,B000NQRE9Q,too expensive. movies are good quality but i think the price was way too much for this product. cool lighter.,1358640000,,109,4.5

2780292,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Beautifully packaged set, full of Indiana goodness. The packaging is about the size of a typical Blu Ray package and therefore sits perfectly with other Blu Rays without taking up much more room. It looks almost like a book, and once you remove it from the sturdy, decorative protective cardboard sleeve, you can see the amount of detail and thought that went into the package. Each ""page"" of the book showcases key drawn depictions of each movie, as well as a miniature picture of the theatrical poster and various pictures taken during the making of the movies. Within each page is an opening where rests a rather snug Blu Ray. My main complaint is that the discs themselves can be rather difficult to remove from the openings so that you don't damage or scratch them. Aside from that one flaw, the set itself is wonderful. Watching these movies again on Blu Ray was spectacular, and makes you fall in love with Indy all over again.",1358467200,,934,4.666666666666667

2780310,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Who doesn't love the Indiana Jones movies?  Well, with the notable exception of Crystal Skull, but that one barely counts (thanks Shia LeBeouf).  Even discounting Crystal Skull, you're paying less than the normal cost of each of the original three on DVD.  Find this set on sale (like I did) and there's no way to pass it up.  The set also includes pretty much every scrap of behind-the-scenes material that exists for the series, which was a fun watch.  I will say that watching older films ""updated"" to high definition always seems to make the chintzy backgrounds (especially in fast-moving vehicle scenes where they are stationary and using a moving background), but they've really done a great job with the actors and props being crystal clear.",1358121600,,748,4.904761904761905

2780312,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I love these movies!  They are fun to watch!  Probably because they are older movies but the Blu Ray quality could be better.  There is way too much snow and video noise for me.  Not crystal clear like you'd expect.  I have a 10 foot 3D 1.07 Billion colors projection screen and frankly, I was very dissappointed with the grainy pic.  On my 60 inch LG plasma it looks great!  Still, I recommend this set to everyone.",1358121600,,416,4.324675324675325

2780314,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I've seen IJ from theater, VHS, cable, HDTV and finally BR, and this is the best currently for home viewers.  The texture within images, sets, and costumes come alive on BR, its the sharpest and clearest video I've seen for the whole series, even compared to HDTV.  The sound is equally improved, superb imaging and clarity, even the musical scores are crisp clear and boom into my room with 5.1 surround, and the dialog doesn't get washed out by the music or sound effects.  To compare IJ before remastering, see the trailers on the disks: blurry, washout out and muted.

Packaging is not best for storing disks; disk are inserted on the side like old LP records, disk are more likely to fall out once the box is removed from the sleave.  The package is full of Photoshopped graphics, I'd prefer screenshots of the best of each video.",1358121600,,835,4.614864864864865

Family loves to watch them, have made them big fans also.  Highly recommended to anyone that wants to be able to watch these masterpieces anytime they want.

Also, on a side note, big Kudos to Amazon!  I purchased this product and did not open it until Christmas, one of the discs had a small crack that made it unplayable in my PS3, I was past the return date, but a quick email to amazon resolved that.  They sent me a replacement set and I returned the previous, all is great now!  Excellent work Amazon, that is why I will always recommend them!",1358035200,,689,4.213740458015267

Just about makes a person want to be an Archaeologist..... These movies are highly entertaining and fun. Well worth the price of admission. The fourth movie is not as bad as a lot of people say.....

The picture quality jump from the previous dvd version is incredible, Raiders in particular is jaw dropping. Ive never seen these movies look this good. The special features are in depth, interesting and really well done. They kept me entertained for hours.

So it was virtually a no brainer when the Blu Ray collection came out.  I hesitate only, because the original price was something like $69 for the 5-disc set.  Well lets face it, given how weak the 4th installment was, and the fact that all the extra features are the same as before (and have not gotten any improved video) its really only the 3-disc set I was shopping for.  So when the price came down to $39, THEN it was a no brainer.  I'm happy that episode 1 looks so much better.  Wish they could get it looking as good as episodes 2 & 3 which look brilliant.  But they are all stunning compared to the originals.  Oh, and just for grins, I did watch the Cystal Skull to see if it was as weak as I'd remembered.  And while there are some enjoyable sequences, the inevitable sentimental ending is so sacharine sweet (and hardly credible), you're just glad its over fast.

Great mix of adventure with comedic elements and also family friendly. I grew up watching these films and love to watch them over and over; they are so good they never get old. The best of the 4 is Last Crusade, then Raiders of the Lost Ark, then somewhat of a tie between Crystal Skull (weird alien thing going on) and Temple of Doom (weird voo doo stuff).",1356220800,,674,4.443548387096774

It has plenty of extra features on a seperate blu ray. You could wait for the seperate releases for sure but a true fan wants all the movies!.  These movies look great too, with fine remastering done on them. The price is high but the films will probably be 15.00 when they come out seperately so it will be the same anyway.  If you don't know what this series of movies is then here's the scoop , they are a tribute to the movie serials of the 40's. And they are all good imo , yes even the last one. (which is the least of the package in everyones opinion). So grab some popcorn and enjoy these timeless adventures , which were also loosely based on a real archeologist.

2780417,4,B000NQRE9Q,"The four films in Steven Spielberg's (and George Lucas') ""Indiana Jones"" quartet of movies arrive on Blu-ray in extremely sharp and nice looking presentations.

The quality for all four films varies a bit as they were shot over the course of a long period of time and film stocks changed with time as well. This results in a film like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" looking quite grainy at the beginning while ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" shot three years later looks a lot ""cleaner"" when it comes to film grain. Colors for all three films pop and detail is remarkably sharp particularly during some of the darker sequences which, when they were transferred to DVD, required tha the contrast be dialed down a bit. Ironically, as we proceed through the series of films the image quality improves signficantly while the films themselves aren't necessarily better with each installment.

Of the four films in the set the first and third are (generally) thought to be the best of the series. While that may be true, none of these films are bad (the fourth film ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" despite its lukewarm reception is better than a lot of people give it credit for although it isn't a classic in the same manner as ""Raiders"" or ""Last Crusade"").

The packaging for this set is less than ideal. Although using book-style packaging was a clever idea, the discs slip into very tight cardboard pages that could result in scratching to the discs. Each movie receives its own ""pages"" with images of the posters for each film and still images.

""Raiders"" benefits from a terrific, witty script from Lawrence Kasdan and inspired direction by Steven Spielberg who was in his prime during this period. Terrific performances from Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman and John Rhys-Davies compliment the well designed action sequences.

""Raiders"" introduces us to Indiana Jones (Ford) an archeologist who races to find the Ark of the Covenant before his foe Belloq (Freeman) who is working for the Nazi's. It seems that Hitler wants to use the Ark to unleash the power of God on his foes.

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is set before ""Raiders"" (even though it was shot and released after ""Raiders)and finds Indy battling the Thuggee cult in India. The cult has stolen three sacred stones and is kidnapping the children from local villages forcing them to work the mines.

""Temple of Doom"" received a decidely mixed reception when it was released in 1984 due to the violence which resulted in the creation of the PG-13 rating. The opening sequence with its clever musical number is much stronger than the rest of the film. The script isn't as clever nor as witty as ""Raiders"" and many of the roles (particularly that of Willie Scott an annoying love interest who whines, screams and is unappealing throughout the film)are underwritten or poorly developed. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is a highlight but the rest of the supporting cast from ""Raiders"" is sorely missed.

""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" benefited from a very good script written by Jeffrey Boam (the TV show ""Brisco County Jr."", ""Lethal Weapon 3""). Although not quite as strong as ""Raiders"", the performances of Sean Connery as Indy's dad and the late River Phoenix as a young Indiana during the opening sequence as well as the return of the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies in supporting roles helped elevate the film. Spielberg's direction throughout is as energetic as the first film and the flaws that dogged the second film aren't in evidence here.

""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" isn't as bad as its reputation and, although flawed in a number of ways (particularly with the casting of Shia LaBouf as Indy and Marion's son), the supporting cast is terrific and it's nice that Karen Allen returns to the series to give some closure to the relationship between Indy and Marion from the first film. Cate Blanchett gives a terrific performance as the ""bad guy"" Irina Spalko. It's a pity it took nearly 20 years to make this sequel (Lucas was preoccupied with making his ""Star Wars"" prequels and then turned down a number of scripts including one written by Frank Darabont best known for ""The Walking Dead"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" )but, despite the dramatic flaws of the script, many of the action sequences compare favorably to those from the first and third films.

""Crystal Skull"" finds Indy trying to discover the secret of the crystal skull which seem to have supernatural power before Soviet agent Irina Spalko (Blanchett)can discover them. Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, Indy finds himself uncertain who his allies are including his long time friend Mac (Ray Winstone) and who his enemies are as he travels to South America to uncover the origin of the mysterious artifacts.

The special features include teaser and theatrical trailers for all three films (no commentary tracks--Spielberg doesn't believe in them)with the rest of the special features isolated to the last disc of the set.

""On Set with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'"" includes behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes and deleted scenes for the film. It includes candid interviews from the time. The behind-the-scenes footage was shot on 16mm and is presented full frame. The 58 minute documentary is broken down into two sections.

We also get the behind-the-scenes documentaries ported over from the previous boxed set. These are a number of featurettes on all three films included from the previous boxed set. Not all of these are presented in 1080p.

If you are fans of ""Crystal Skull"" you should be aware that the extras on the second disc are, for the most part, missing from this set. We do get brief featurettes on the visual effects for the fourth film as well as two featurettes on the props and the post production on the film.

Although the quality of the films vary quite a bit, all four of the Indiana Jones films are worthwhile (yes, even the dreaded ""Crystal Skull""). Let's hope that if Lucas and Spielberg decide to return to make another Indiana Jones fil that they'll recall what made the first and third films so much fun.

So I went for the second disc which was supposed to be ""Temple of Doom"". Nope. ""Bonus features"". Third disc? Nope. ""Temple of Doom"". Only two left now. And in the fourth disk which was supposed to be ""Last Crusade"" finally there is ""Raiders"". Any guess what was in the final case which was labeled ""Bonus Features""? Last Crusade? Nope. A SECOND ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It is bad enough to be forced to buy all four movies when only two are worth watching.

Previously i bought couple blu ray of old movies came out in 80's and early 2000 were poorly put together. but let me tell you those doubts are gone. These movies are remastered and sound quality is awesome perfect for home theater. i have never seen such a good packaging for the movies, you get sort of book, where they have place pictures of cast/scenes from each movie. you get the idea. for the price you cannot get better than this.

Well, what can I say?  These are, all four, great enjoyable movies.  I would rate them in this order: Last Crusade, Raiders, Crystal Skull/Temple of Doom (a tie).  Unlike ""reviewers"" who dislike the fourth movie, I am happy to have all the movies in one place.  And the price, $39.99, is unbeatable.  I'm a lazy reviewer.  If you want the detailed, technical review, go to xxx-xxx.xxx.  (Amazon doesn't allow external urls.  Suffice it to say, the name of the media format,  BLU-RAY, is the name of the site.)

The packaging isn't the best.  I would rate it 3 out of five stars.  If you are careful, you shouldn't have any problems.  I would suggest getting a good 5 disc holder and putting the movies in there.  Do a search here on Amazon for EMPTY BLU-RAY CASES.  You should find something you like.

Overall: This is the best version of these movies currently available.  At a reasonable price, you shouldn't be disappointed with this set.",1354838400,2,1968,4.798165137614679

From the great minds of Lucas and Spielberg, comes our favourite traveler and adventurer. Each one delivers a fun time and a great chance to see the world looking for treasure and history. With many extras and a whole lot of in depth behind the scenes and hours of excitement. Despite many who didn't like Crystal Skull, its still a great fun time. Harrison Ford is still the great traveler and great personality.",1354752000,,545,4.628865979381444

It comes with a Film cell and a leather bound replica of Dr. Jones' Journal! ITS AWESOME. Why in the US they would not release that superior edition I do not know. It is very sad. Maybe its a production issue. Never the less it seems to me that the UK always has the better releases. They always have cooler covers and they almost always have a Steelbook case for their releases. Needless to say I ended up getting the better version off Ebay. but maybe amazon UK has some in stock?",1354665600,5,651,4.258064516129032

1. The ability to configure how often it checks

When I bring it back in the following day, it only displays the text 'Last updated at <updatetime> on <date> (i.e Last updated at 13:15 on 16/7/2011). This stays like this for a few hours.

Sure, the buns, cheese, and ground beef are all of the highest quality, and quite tasty, but that fourth item, the spit, just ruins the whole thing.

2780470,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Simply put: this is a well crafted blu ray boxset. My wife was disappointed because we got rid of a lot of her DVDs a few years ago, one of those being her Indiana Jones trilogy boxset. As soon as I heard this set was available for pre-order, I hopped all over it. Of course, Amazon, being as awesome as it always is, the price started out high, but dropped quite a bit when it was finally released. I received the movies the same day they were in stores and couldn't be happier.",1354665600,,479,4.161290322580645

2780476,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This is for the blu-ray set.  First, as at least one other reviewer has said, this comes in packaging that is like a book, where a page is a sleeve which holds a disc.  The back side of the page/sleeve is plastic, and the front side is paper that has information about the disc written on the outer facing for you to read.  So, the readable side of the disc is sliding against plastic when you remove the disc, so it's best to do this with care.  I disagree with another reviewer that this will damage the disc over time.  Blu-ray discs are more durable than CDs and DVDs, and it's very hard to scratch one.  Maybe if you watch the movies more than once a month you should buy plastic disc cases to put them in.  However, the disc are more likely to be damaged when you place it on your coffee table and then your dog or kid grabs it, chews on it, etc...

On to the movies.  I only watched the first one so far, and I thought the picture was very good for a remastered 1970s movie (or was it very early 80s?).  I didn't expect it to be any better, so I would say that for the quality of the picture, if you like the Indiana Jones movies this set is worth it when priced well.  The sound was acceptable to me, but I was listening to it via the TV and not a sound system.

As far as the movies themselves, well there are too many reviews covering the movies.  Most people like 1 and 3, they tolerate 2, and the 4th is a mixed bag.

Overall I feel the set's worth it.",1354320000,,1464,4.02076124567474
2780477,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I have been looking for this movie collection as an addtion to my growing DVD and Blu-Ray Collection, it's great to have it we have already had a Indiana Jones Marathon watching each movie until we finished them, it was great.",1354233600,,226,4.536585365853658
2780478,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I know, I know. As my title suggests, I pretend the fourth movie doesn't exist. It's a divisive issue which I will not delve into here. To each their own.

I'll just say this: The first three movies are still amazing and they look better here than ever before. Haven't looked at the fourth, I imagine it's the same as whatever it's original bluray release looks like.

There is also a ton of extras to sort through. If you're an Indy fan, you really can't say no to this set, it's worth the price.",1354233600,,497,4.276595744680851
2780479,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I loved being able to watch Raiders in beautiful High Definition. It was glorious. I was also really intrigued by the extras, and watching them film to original movie. Some of the alternate takes and the conversations between the actors and the director were extremely interesting for anyone that cares about the process of making movies, let alone a classic.

I love Indiana Jones and only wish the Crystal Skull was a much better film. The first forty-five minutes feels like it could be a great Indy film, but the rest of it is a mess. It makes Temple of Doom look like high art. Nevertheless, I love the first three films, and having them on Blu-Ray makes me happy.",1354233600,,669,4.575

2780481,2,B000NQRE9Q,I have seen Raiders presented in HD on USA and on ABC a few times recently and I have a D-VHS copy of it recorded off ABCHD in 720P and it looks much better than this bluray release.  The exposures seem off many times and the film grain seems to be excessive.  The scene where Indy and Marion are at Sala's house in Cairo opens with them on the veranda and the exposure seems off there.  In the past this scene is brightly lit and contrasty with the white clothing and white stucco buildings brilliantly displayed against the sunny blue skies.  It seems very muted on the Blu-ray transfer and again the film grain is annoying and I don't recall it being a problem in the past.  The scene where Indy is standing by lake before entering the cave during the opening scene shows the exposure issues as well.  It's sloppy at best.  I have yet to watch the other 3 but I feel like I wasted my money on this.  Any reviewer giving this disc more than 2 stars for Picture Quality is delusional.,1354060800,3,985,4.286486486486487
2780482,4,B000NQRE9Q,I love these movies. To experience them in blu ray is truly amazing on my Samsung LED TV. 4 stars based on nothing else but how awful the 4th movie is. Not even worthy of being an Indiana jones movie IMO.,1354060800,,204,4.0

2780491,5,B000NQRE9Q,"...It Must Be Indiana Jones. Over 30 years later this tagline still rings true to me, recalling fond memories of growing up with these films and watching them endlessly. Even as an adult I have yet to find another franchise that captures my imagination and thrills me as much as this series can. I've been waiting for years for Indy to make the jump to Blu-Ray and I'm happy to say that, aside from a couple minor quibbles, he's done it with his fedora firmly in place.

Most buyers are picking this up for the enhanced picture and sound, something that a majority of consumers should be pleased with. All four films look and sound better than ever, except for Crystal Skull, which is a repeat of the previous Blu-Ray release. It was already stellar and if you've already seen it then you know the picture and sound were top notch. The original three films are all cleaner and more vibrant than they've ever been, though I must admit the transfer didn't blow me away like I was expecting. The audio and visual quality is certainly better than any previous release and should be enough to satisfy anyone looking to update their collection. I guess I was just hoping for a bit more detail and clarity, something that older films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0074JOUHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur: 50th Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-African-Queen-Blu-ray/dp/B001UHOWWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The African Queen [Blu-ray</a>] did brilliantly. Don't get me wrong, they look great: just not quite as sharp as I was expecting.

As others have already mentioned, the packaging itself looks very nice. The problem is that it's not functional and getting the discs out requires some additional effort. Blu-Ray discs are certainly more durable than DVDs but I have a feeling more than a few customers will experience some wear and tear with this set. It's baffling why so many companies can't find a safe way to bundle these sets while still making them aesthetically pleasing. It's a minor gripe but one that matters when you're spending this kind of money on something you love.

2780494,4,B000NQRE9Q,"The Indiana Jones blu-ray collection is absolutely a feast for the eyes and ears, and the movies have never looked or sounded better than they do now in high-def.  All of the extras from the previous DVD collection have been ported over, and I like that the packaging takes up about 1/4th of the room on my shelf as the old collection.  Unfortunately, the studio decided to go with the same weird paper envelope/sleeve thing that was used for the Star Wars set released last year.  Not only is it hard to get the movies out of the case, there's a greater chance they'll be scratched as you take them in and out.  It's an absolutely unnecessary design choice, and one that I wish Lucasfilm would abandon for their top-tier releases.  However, it's a minor gripe, since if you're really concerned about damage, you can buy your own cases and take the discs out of the stupid booklet thing.",1351728000,3,887,4.553459119496855

I haven't watched the other movies in this set, although I understand they didn't undergo the same process, I'm expecting them to look pretty good, too.

It is good don't get me wrong these films are great but I was really looking for a more in the special features like deleted scenes. This collection was put out by the same people who put together the Star Wars on blu ray collection in which they did an awesome job with the special features with a lot of deleted scenes and other extras so I guess you can say I was kind of expecting the same thing out of the Indiana Jones blu ray collection.,1350518400,7,503,4.142857142857143

This is one the best action/adventure series ever filmed and there can't be many people who disagree with me. It's adrenaline pumped, wall to wall action and had been on my blu-ray bucket list for some time now. I am so glad there weren't any ""alterations"" ala Star Wars because they were perfect as they were.
Hariison Ford in his heyday was unstoppable and even as most trilogies suffer by the last one, The Last Crusade was the best of the group. Sean Connery;s interplay with Indy was classic. The storyline merged both historical scenery with mythological/religious undertones without stuffing it down your throat.

It rocked the walls in my house...nice indeed.
Day two I watched Temple of Doom. The video was much better than Raiders..much more detail showed through.

Don't know if anyone else has had this issue.  I realize that it may just be cosmetic and I don't mean to be nit-picky.  However, I don't know how deep the scratches have to be on a blu-ray disc to cause playback issues.

My total cost was $73 USD and I have watched only the first 2 so far.  There were 5 BD disks including the bonus disk.  The 2 movies I watched had no commentary and the theatrical trailers were the only additional features on those 2 disks.  The bonus Blu-ray and had the ""makings"" of the 4 movies and ""on the set of the lost arc"".  It would have been better if some commentaries by the actors were on the individual disks.  There were no digital or DVD backups provided but I had no problem cloning to BD-R.  The packaging could have been a lot better.  The artwork was very nice but there was no easy way to remove the disks from the cardboard sleeve without smudging the recorded surface.  A hole or V-cut would have made it easy to remove but would conflict with the pretty artwork due to the packaging design.  I smudged an interior disk attempting to extract and it would not play properly till I cleaned it.  For comparison, my Lord of the Rings extended version had 15 easy to remove disks with 6 Blu-ray and 9 DVDs and a much better presentation box at $108 USD.

I was specifically impressed with the sound as the soundtrack and little noises were very well spread out over my 7.1 surround system and I noticed things that I did not ever hear before.

The extra disc is quite nice as well, giving a lot of detail and incite into the behind the scenes of some of my favorite movies.

Even the lesser of the 4 movies, The Crystal Skull was still presented nicely in HD. I respect and appreciate all the Indiana Jones movies even if the sequels don't live up to Raiders. I like each one for different reasons, but just as the Alien movies, each one if very different and enjoyable in its own way.

Very very highly recommended.",1348617600,9,831,4.280254777070064
2780522,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Anyone who knows Indiana Jones already knows the plots of these films, so I won't pontificate on those details, and will get right to the transfers:

The Picture (Raiders):

The picture is very sharp, and the dark scenes show exceptionally deep shadow areas and rich colors, especially in the Ravenwood bar, which looks absolutely gorgeous, even more real than I remember it looking in cinemas, but I'm saddened to see that the highlights in the bright outdoor daylight scenes are largely blown out, white, gone.

This is either a problem with the transfer, or, and I hope not, the source, the original film negative. If the latter, it's so sad to see a great film like Raiders fade over time. If the former, we'll have to wait for yet another transfer. If I remember correctly, Lowry Digital Studios did the restorations for DVD back in 2003. I'm guessing the 2012 archivists, at Lowry or another facility, didn't use that old Lowry transfer for blu-ray because it was a much lower res scan than the 4k scan done here.

The transfer of Raiders also carries with it what another reviewer described as an ""orange teal""; that is, everything is colored in a kind of warm, golden amber yellow-orange tint. This is great in the Raven bar and in the Idol's temple when Indy is bathed in the shaft of light emanating from the golden Idol itself, but, in other scenes, like the thunderstorm in the desert at night when the Arabs are uncovering the Well of Souls, the scene should be more blue, and is instead, in the amber tint of this transfer, kind of a neutral gray.

Compared to Temple, Crusade and even Crystal Skull, which look gorgeous, true to their big-screen incarnations, sadly, Raiders is a pale digital facsimile of the original film.  This transfer could have and should have looked so much deeper and richer, with black as black, with its highlights preserved, with its proper color pallette.  Movies should be honored as time capsules and merely restored to how they looked in the time they were made, not digitally ""enhanced"", ""updated"" to today's aesthetic tastes.  There has to be some technical standard, a reference point for what a film looked like at the time of its release.  The transfer and restoration artists ALMOST got this transfer right, but, sadly, they didn't honor the look of the original film and instead did a ""digital revision"".  If director Steven Spielberg himself signed off on, approved this transfer, he either didn't view it on a correctly calibrated monitor, he was too busy on other projects to really feast his eyes on it, or he's going senile.

Considering that Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite, and, arguably, the best movie in the whole Indiana Jones series, this transfer is a bit disheartening and disappointing, to say the least. To some of you who weren't born yet in 1981 when Raiders was originally released in cinemas, so you never got to see it on the big screen, and thus you have no reference for what Raiders is supposed to look like, you'll enjoy it just fine.

If you already own the DVD of Raiders, hold onto it, as it is, minus the standard-definition limitations of DVD, closer to Raiders' original, true cinematic vision.  I'll hold onto the DVD until a blu-ray is done properly, at which point the proper blu-ray disc will assume its rightful place on the throne of its slot in this blu-ray set, replacing this blu-ray disc, which will go in the trash.  I have to give the visual transfer of Raiders on blu-ray only a 3 out of 5 stars.

The Sound (Raiders):

Some sound-FX and dialogue are crystal clear, with some new effects added, like dripping water in the South American temple and some new ""pfew!"" sound-FX of the poison darts spitting at Indy when he removes the Idol from its pedestal and flees as all hell breaks loose (YES! Thanks, Ben Burtt!), others less than stellar, a bit muted, and, like the Jaws transfer for blu-ray, sound mixers added that extra reverb to John Williams' classic score...broadened the spaciousness and cavernousness of the music, but the music now lacks the definition and clarity of the highs found on previous releases. Sounds like the London Symphony Orchestra is performing at a ball game. Enveloping, and yet lacking definition. Disappointing. I have to give the sound of Raiders a 4 out of 5 stars.

Now, onto Temple and Crusade...

The picture:

I'm only guessing here, and could be wrong, but it looks like these ARE the earlier, and excellent 2003 Lowry digital transfers done for the DVDs, now shown in their native high-res format, instead of being down-rezzed by the picture-quality limitations of DVD. They look great! The color red is more prevalent on the blu-rays of Temple and Crusade than on their corresponding DVDs, which is especially useful, and wonderful, inside the Temple of Doom, with all the red presumably coming from fiery volcanic fissures. This is a masterwork of film lighting from the late, great cinematographer Douglas Sloccombe, and is presented here gorgeously. Bravo!

The sound:

It has some nice new discreet directionality in the rear surrounds, which is especially evident in Crusade, when the Messerchmidts are chasing Indy and his dad. And John Williams' scores have never sounded better!

Kingdom of the Crystal Skull:

Picture quality seems to be the same as the previous blu-ray, which already looked quite good, faithful to Skull's theatrical release. The main difference here is the sound has been updated to DTS-HD, adding more depth to the soundtrack.

The extras from the DVD set are all here, with some new additions:

On Set With Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I found particularly rivetting, about the increasingly lost, dying art of on-set live action production. It shows the miracle of what was accomplished in-camera, with very little reliance on post-production, until we get to the opening of the Ark of the Covenant, with director Steven Spielberg saying how hard it is to explain to actors something that they can't see, and won't be there until post-production visual FX are completed. What I found most captivating about watching this footage is it shows just how tireless Steven Spielberg is. He really deserves all the money and credit he gets, because he works very hard. And he clearly LOVES what he is doing, making movies!

The original 1981 featurette, The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark

The Melting Head, showcasing a modern reenactment of what was required to make Toht's head melt.

2780524,3,B000NQRE9Q,"I'm very happy to finally have Raiders of the Lost Ark on Blu Ray, but the conversion isn't as good as I'd hoped.  It may be that they can only work with the quality of the original 35mm, and bringing a ton of clarity to it reveals flaws.  Most of the early part of the movie in South America is grainy as if the lighting was poor.  And you can see the focus go in and out during some of the cave scenes.  The color also seems a little over-saturated and the blacks are a little heavy.  I'm sure it's better than standard definition, but it didn't come out as well as the Blu Ray release of Star Wars.",1348444800,4,601,4.016806722689076

2780526,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Not really going to pontificate about how great they look or sound. Can sum it up in one word, outstanding (no exclamation point). The extras, again a thumbs' up.  One thing about the extras though, not all the Crystal Skull special features got ported over. So if you got it, save it. If you didn't, get it.  if you bought any exclusives you might want to keep them. Got the Best Buy Trilogy with the extra Vintage Featurette disc and the Target book exclusive and learned not to dump any special editions.

 Now lets get to the reason this gets four stars and not five. It's really not about these movies in particular, it's about he packaging. The first Blu-ray book style packaging I got was Avatar.  It had a nice little tray and you could pull out the disc about half way to grab it. Then came Star Wars, yikes! A semi-tray that I had to stick my finger under the disc and pull it out. Not a fan of this because I don't like to grab the playing surface of the disc. This goes back to the first DVDs and players. Any scratches or fingerprint smudges affected playback. As the lasers got better it wasn't so much an issue but still hate to touch the disc.

This packaging really threw me. not only did I have to pinch the disc to grab it but it really is an effort to pull it out. Can't tell for sure but there is something in the page/sleeve that is retaining the disc. Don't know if it's to keep them from falling out if you happen to hold the book by the spine with the pages down. Equal effort to put them back in. I know Blu-rays are supposed to be tough but, we really don't need to test that with this type of packaging.

I know, I know. You think I'm trying to find something wrong in an otherwise perfect release. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this set.  Just trying to give the whole picture. If you bought this you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't then I'm giving you a head's up.

As always just speaking as a consumer and fan of the medium. Every day takes us one step closer to finally retiring our VCR's and giving the tapes to charity. Thank you Phillips for pursuing laser video technology.

2780527,5,B000NQRE9Q,"They movies are very well done although i had some issues with certain scenes in Raiders and in Last Crusade. There were 3 or 4 scenes in which the picture got somewhat fuzzy. I paused it and it remained. It doesnt last very long but  it is noticeable enough to get your attention.

Audio is exceptional on all but Raiders. There really isn't much in the way of 5.1 sound but it gets more dynamic with each movie as the technology improved. Still well worth the money and i felt like a kid all over again.",1348358400,,505,4.25
2780528,3,B000NQRE9Q,"I really don't understand what George Lucas has against putting any of his material on PSN, Zune (xbox) Video Marketplace, Vudu, etc. Even Spielburg with certain movies he's directed himself refutes it. (Video rental stores don't exist anymore, remember?). Even Peter Jackson put up Lord Of The Rings after a year or two. Don't get me wrong i'm one of the biggest Indy fans on the planet, but putting all these movies in one boxset is just another way for these movie industries to make cash. Also once they are opened you can't return them. We've been dooped in the past from Spielburg with the ultra poor Jurassic Park blu ray transfers, George Lucases over the top extra added CGI into the original Star Wars Trilogy, and so on. So it's no wonder people are in question of the newer products and have such high hope, then get let down. We never learn. Watching ""these"" particular films over and over, and even showing them to your kids is highly unlikely, so paying the 70$ price tag is just senseless, especially if your getting it for the special features which aren't in HD anyway. Raiders looks to me, the same as it does on Xfinity HD movies. Temple Of Doom (which is my least favorite) looks very good but still lacks super clarity. Yes i know these movies are old but take a look at what they did with Jaws, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. They look like brand new 2012 films, not 70's.

With a huge collection like this you would think whatever team remasters and restores them would want to take more time on it, to make it the BEST. Not the case. The Last Crusade still looks sub par to my eyes and it's only about 23 years old. Sound quality as with most is great, but we don't purchase it based on just that. So as i stated at the start, make these movies available on PSN, Xbox, VUDU, Amazon Movies etc. They you can rent it for a small price, enjoy it, then if it's not what you think just whip out the old DVDS. But we aren't given that option. I've waited since the inception of Blu Ray for these movies and i can't say i'm really happy. The restoration is ok, but not what i was expecting. And i have a great Samsung 52"" TV. The box is pretty generic but i doubt i'll be showing people at work, saying wow look at how bad the packaging is on these blu ray set. Most would say they don't care anyways, since the ""average"" person doesn't even know or care what ""blu ray"" is. So pay the money if you want, i regrettably did. Oh well, that'll learn me. :)

2780529,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I have been enthralled by all things Indiana Jones since Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in 1981.  When the last movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came out a few years back, it created a new interest by younger moviegoers in Indy's adventures, and that was pleasing to me in itself.  I was curious, however, why it took so long for this series to be released on Blu-ray, and after an interminable wait to just get it done, here it is.  And the series has been dusted off, buffed up, and a good amount of bonus material involving the ""making of.."" these movies has been released along with the movies.  To Indy junkies it's like nectar from the gods.  To casual viewers, perhaps the bonus material is not all that big a deal.

The series now takes up much less space than owning all four of the movies in individual cases; that in itself is a plus, as is the improved quality of the movies itself.  But after all this time, and all the hype, when you open the package you may wonder, as I did, why they had to make the case on the cheap and have you slide the movies into cardboard sleeves instead of mounting them on little hubs as is usually done.  It may be no big deal to the majority of people, but to me it's sort of like someone running their fingernails over a chalkboard to slide a pristine disc in and out of cardboard, which in itself is abrasive and is more so as it picks up dust over time.  I'm sure the movies will continue to play fine for a long period of time, but I am also sure that each time you slide one out, the disc surface will have more and more little micro-scratches marring the surface.

A set such as this deserves decent packaging.  In short, the movies are great and worth the wait.  The packaging is cheap in order to save a few cents per set.  There is really no excuse for it, sorry.",1348185600,24,1843,4.201704545454546

well I can tell you this, watching Raiders on my oppo blu ray player, hooked to my samsung LED TV.......and enjoyng the audio thru my Bose Surround system.........has been a highly enjoyable experience, the picture quality is breath taking, its hard to believe these movies were made, quite a while back............the blu ray transfer, truly is steller, If your a fan of these movies, I highly reccomend this purchase, you will be blown away, by the high quality, of this blu ray set, as well as the packaging, it truly is worthy of a purchase, you will thank me!!",1348185600,4,692,4.680327868852459
2780531,2,B000NQRE9Q,"Yes, it's finally out!! Been waiting so long! But... Not sure if everyone else is oblivious to the risk of this collection but read on...

What is seriously going on with the execs who make the decisions for these long awaited collections? Is it a conspiracy for companies to give us bad packaging in hopes we ruin the product in hopes we buy it again after we ruin them over a long period? I'm not a movie troller who hates movies and Indiana Jones is one of the greatest franchises ever, I'm just fed up with these horrible packaging ideas.  Basically the Indiana Jones Adventures is in identical packaging to the Clint Eastwood collection which was one of the worst packaging ideas ever. Here's the main issue, these treasured movies are stuffed in between two pieces of hard abrasive cardboard. In order to pull a movie out, you have to grab both sides of the disc right near the edge, immediately putting finger prints on the information side of the disc. Not to mention pulling it out on the bare cardboard as it's packed in so tight.  Do this over a period of time, you're asking for trouble. Even trouble, i noticed a tiny 2cm scratch on Raiders the FIRST time I pulled it out from rubbing against the cardboard. Mind you, these blu ray discs can withstand scratches, but how much and for how long do you want to chance it?  It's packed in so tight, it's just bound to happen when one day you're gonna freeze up thanks to a nice scratch from your case. IF you buy this collection which I still say you should, just take them out safely as you can and store them in a regular DVD Case. A major pain and yes, the case is basically worthless and nice to look at, but don't risk it if you want to savior this collection that is wonderful if you can salvage it before ruining it. Some people have said squeeze the cardboard to loosen and wait for it to fall out, I did try this on Raiders and temple and the disc did not move

If you want to know about the movies, on how they look, I actually think the older movies look even better than Skulls. Obviously the first 3 classics got the most love. Skulls is inferior, so we know why though. The extras are great, a nice documentary of watching Raiders with lots of deleted scenes and lost footage is an amazing find. Bonus materials are amazing! Just be really careful taking these movies out of the cases. Feel free to use Crystal Skulls as a coffee cup holder. ;)",1348099200,184,2417,4.362222222222222
2780532,5,B000NQRE9Q,"All of the films look very crisp and sound awesome(DTS)! The packaging is very nice and has some neat artwork that I never saw. Some people have been fussy with how 'Raiders' looked, but they fail to remember the age of the film;some of the matte painting shots are blurry. But they all never looked and sounded better!

I am a fan of these films, I saw Raiders last week in IMAX. I feel it is the best Action Adventure of all time! Nobody can top the technical significance of the 'Truck chase' in Raiders!

The 'Temple of Doom' is a close 2nd. It has the most awesome 40 minute finale in the history of film! It goes so low (dark,violent) and rises so high out of it with wall to wall rousing scenes.

'The Last Crusade' is the most sentimental of all of the films. Without Sean Connery, it is kinda too ordinary, but its good fun!

Because I am an Indy fan, I still like 'Crystal Skull' but I certainly call it the weakest of the 4. I think they all progressively get worse, but they are all good films. If you watch the DOC's Spielberg is apologizing that he didn't want to do aliens! Too much CGI!! Ford was 65 in the last film, but he worked great! The material was the problem! The crew got too lazy and forgot how to properly do an action film like the others! 'Crystal Skull' and 'The Lost World' are OK films, but since they have Steven Speilberg's name attached to them, they are not good!

  The extras are alot of fun. There is a new 1 hour DOC on Raiders that is so cool! It shows fun deleted scenes and outtakes in HD!.

Indy paid homage to the Action serials. Now current action films are a garbled mess. You cant tell what is goin on. New filmmakers need to study the 'truck chase' in Raiders so they know how to do an effective and digestible action scene.

John Williams is such a big part of the significance of these films. Especially Temple of doom. I am sad that movies like these are something we have to dig for, because the 'new' movies just don't get it!",1348012800,8,1981,4.23342175066313
2780533,1,B000NQRE9Q,After watching these movies for years on vhs and dvd I was expecting a better transfer to blu ray that was on a par as the Jaws blu ray. The quality in parts was blurry and pretty poor for a blu ray disc. Pretty disappointed really.,1348012800,25,232,4.065217391304348

All I can read is how Lucas has ripped people off again & the crappy cardboard box the movies came in. Seriously!? Ok; I too am sick of the studios ripping consumers & movie lovers off with over-priced, underwhelming box-sets that don't deliver on the quality we expect. But as far as just releasing the first 3 movies; it only makes sense to include all 4 movies in an Indiana Jones box set! I don't think the studios care if some already own the 4th movie. That's what ebay is for. Or just wait til the movies come out individually like the Godfather trilogy or Die Hard. Since I already own Alien maybe they should offer a box set with just Aliens-Alien Resurrection. That makes perfect sense! 5-stars all the way!

2780536,3,B000NQRE9Q,"First off I just want to say FIVE STARS for the movies and the transfers. I would definitely recommend you buy this, but only if you're willing to purchase your own alternative packaging. Here's the story:

I cannot tell you how overjoyed I am to finally have this set on bluray. Unfortunately as soon as I opened up the package my joy turned to disappointment. There I saw another of these horrible book-style packages that seem to be popular for high profile sets these days (Alien, Star Wars).These packages hold your discs hostage in there cardboard clutches and WILL kill the hostage. By this I mean it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove the discs from the book pages and over time will scratch them if you take them out more than a few times. Add to that the fact that these discs feel distinctly flimsier than other blurays I've owned and you have a recipe for disaster.",1347926400,19,876,4.579617834394904

I just want the three original titles - and I want them in standard Blu Ray cases, not much to ask.  I generally hate ""special"" packaging for these sets.  Have any of the a-holes that design this stuff ever tried to put it on their shelves?  I am guessing not.  I for one am not buying jack until I can get them packaged properly.  The same went for Back to the Future and the extended Lord of the Rings movies.

I refuse to buy the bulky cardboard crap - and I won't be bullied into buying titles I don't want just because they're shoe-horned in with the ones I want.  EPIC FAIL by the studio on this.  I just keep watching my standard DVD's until they get it right.",1347926400,12,806,4.148387096774194
2780539,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Wow how time flies, almost had me tear up at then end of crusade when they ride off into the sunset. As for the quality there's only two scenes in the first 3 movies where for some reason the picture gets blurry, and it's not just my copy. When Indy and his helper have spiders on their backs, and when Indy sala and indys dad are in a car, does the same thing perfect picture then blurs. As for each picture quality it gets better for each movie, Venice looked beautiful. They still never fixed the audio bite in temple of doom when their floating in the raft and Winnie is saying she hates this and that and when the word you gets yelled out its a guys voice, indys mouth is shut, another funny thing I just noticed is when their on the blimp.

I have never liked the cardboard sleeve style storage for CD, DVD or Blu-Ray.

2780541,5,B000NQRE9Q,"I am an Indiana Jones fan through and through. I have been since I saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as a child in 1981. The Blu-ray release of such a monumental piece of film history merits taking the day off work and viewing all the entries of the series. Yes, that DOES include ""The Temple of Doom"" and ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""

""Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures"" is what every fan of the archaeologist adventurer has been waiting for since the inception of Blu-ray. It features every film in beautiful high-definition with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" getting the special restoration treatment. The film looks beautiful both at home and on the big-screen. I took my boys to see it in the theater. The film brought tears to my eyes as I thought about the first time I saw it so many years ago and what it meant to me. This was a life-changing event for me much like seeing Star Wars was a few years earlier.

I want to stop and focus on ""Raiders"" for a moment since it's the one that got the most attention. It doesn't lose any of its classic grainy film look. It's just cleaned up and more vibrant. The latest restoration of ""Jaws"" for Blu-ray somehow looks better, but maybe that's because it needed more work to begin with.

Strangely, they didn't tidy up any of the visual effects the way George Lucas is known to do with his space saga. The movie is still effective exactly how it is. However, it would be interesting to see the effects-heavy ending with some of that ILM wizardry put to work on it.

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is just as much fun as it always has been. This is probably the second least favorite film in the franchise behind ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" for most fanatics. It's still a thrilling rollercoaster ride with some great humor thrown in.

""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" to this day wraps up the first three films in the ""original"" trilogy perfectly. It brings back Sallah and Brody and takes us back into the desert to battle Nazis. It also introduces us to Indy's father, who couldn't be anyone else BUT James Bond. Sean Connery delivers a humorous and heartfelt performance as the father of the most famous archaeologist adventurer. Harrison Ford and Connery trade quips and bicker amongst each other in such a convincing manner, you'd think they were really related to each other. It also brings the subject of the quest full circle back to a Christian artifact. Many viewers would agree they were the most successful entries in the series.

""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is definitely the most hated of the series. I get in an argument at least once a week with some crazed Indy fan who whines about how this movie single-handedly destroyed their enjoyment of the entire franchise or wishes it was never made. Some people are so ungrateful. Steven Spielberg delivered a fun adventure that looks and feels very much like it belongs right next to the rest of the films.

The complainers about Indy surviving an atomic explosion after being catapulted through the air to land safely in the desert have selective memory loss. Apparently they don't remember other fantastical moments in the series like the Ark of the Covenant melting people and disintegrating a troop of Nazi officers. How about jumping out of a plane in a raft and landing safely in a river? When was the last time you walked across a canyon on an invisible bridge? Also, the search for three magic rocks is waaaaay off base when compared to ancient alien astronauts. It's unbelievable here, but we sure can accept if for Prometheus.

Bonus features for the set include ""Making of"" documentaries for every film and several ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes. There are teaser and theatrical trailers for each film on each disc as well. There's enough bonus material to merit a fifth disc. Strangely, many of the extras for ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" are not found here. Completists might throw a bit of a fit over that. I say just keep your original copy of the movie on Blu-ray if you really want it.

The ""Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures"" Blu-ray set will look immaculate sitting next to your ""Star Wars"" Blu-ray set. The packaging is the same material and style. They look like they belong together with their matching Lucasfilm logos on the spines. It's strange how movies that continue to make an immeasurable impact on people can fit into such a small space on a shelf. They also remind me of how much thanks I owe to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg for a memorable childhood. Any fanboy or girl who grew up with these films and says differently is lying to themselves.",1347926400,116,4650,4.640340218712029
2780542,2,B000NQRE9Q,"Like the STAR WARS and ALIEN sets before this, the cardboard pages that hold the discs (no matter what shiney $&!% they coat them with) scratch them.  Anything on the disc or caught inside the cheap a$$ folded cardboard WILL SCRATCH THE DISC!  But, once again I'll have to go through set after set trying to get good copies.  Once again I have to buy my own blu ray cases so the set I spent so much money on will last more than one viewing.
  The movies are great.  The transfers are great.  But all that work and quality just goes down the toilet when greedy companys use this cardboard crap.  Why is it that the more popular the series, the more likely it is the studio will pull this on us?  $50 to $100 not enough profit on films already made and paid for at the box office to give us durable cases?  Or is it part of the plan to wreck physical media, force us into downloads, and take away our ability to own the things we pay for.
  As I said before, the quality of the blu rays are exceptional.  Any fan of John Williams iconic score will be delighted with the HD audio mix.  Even though the picture quality is the best ever, it does seem like they tweeked the contrast levels to be more in line with contemporary films.  Good luck getting your scratchless copies so you can enjoy the work that went into them.

2780549,5,B000NQRE9Q,"The 'Jaws' Blu-ray is a brilliant transfer of a 70's movie and the James Bond frame-by-frame transfers are outstanding examples of remastering older films, that's why it's a little mystifying why the 'Raiders' color balance looks a tiny bit off, too much brown/orange. But the transfers are generally fantastic. The classic original along with 'Temple of Doom' and 'Last Crusade' have never looked better, highlighting great British DOP Douglas Slocombe's brilliant deep focus cinematography.

Spielberg's regular DOP, Janusz Kaminiski doesn't really (and probably didn't want to) replicate Slocombe's classic look, but he does subdue his usual milky, soft lit, muted style and gives 'Crystal Skull' a pleasing nostalgic tone.

'Raiders' was the kind of cultural movie phenomenon back in the day that probably only 'The Avengers' matches today, but 'Raiders' even more so as it was such a trendsetting, genre defining movie. There had simply never been anything like it as a big studio, summer event movie.

Roller coaster thrills, perils too numerous to count and great humour powered `Raiders' to instant classic status. It is still a massive influence on pop culture, films and filmmakers.

It's a measure of how successful `Raiders' was is that Harrison Ford was an established star in the mega blockbuster Star Wars series,  but it was Indiana Jones launched him as global the superstar he is 30+ years later. Not bad for a 2nd choice for the lead. The rest of the cast is very special, Karen Allen is a fantastic, feisty love interest and the suave Paul Freeman and reptilian Ronald Lacey are classic villains. Then there's brilliant Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies as Indy's memorable comrades.

It's all driven by Lawrence Kadan's great script that fills out Spielberg's brilliant set pieces with plenty of humour and gravitas. And of course there's the classic John Williams music that lifts all this genius to even greater heights.

`Temple of Doom' is arguably the most viscerally exciting of the first three, but it's also the most controversial. An adventure movie that borders on horror and at times is downright sadism. Plus it's got the one of most annoying heroines in movies, Kate Capshaw has great appeal, but is done no favors with the way her whiny character is written. She's unfortunately matched in the pain-in-the-behind stakes by Indy's sidekick Short Round.

Mola Ram is a heinous bad guy, played with demonic zeal by Indian star Amrish Puri.

The set pieces are absolutely brilliant throughout, but the overall nasty dark tone detract from what is a great adventure film.

`Last Crusade' was a welcome return to the tone of `Raiders' and whilst it lacked the freshness of the original or the sheer thrills of `Temple', it is easily the most emotionally  resonant and dramatically satisfying of the series.  Spielberg's brilliant casting of Sean Connery as Indy's father makes for real movie magic as two of the biggest movie starts of all time make a wonderful double act that powers the heart and soul of this movie.

In terms of special features, this box sets isn't quite up there with Star Wars or even the original Star Trek films set, but it's still an absolute must have, sure to please fans.",1347753600,7,3231,5.016822429906542

2780554,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Swinging onto Blu-Ray at last, INDIANA JONES: THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES is undoubtedly going to rank as one of the fall's must-have format releases.  Paramount's five-disc set includes the HD debuts of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" on Blu-Ray with a fourth disc of extras and a fifth (""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"") that some fans likely feel is best left as a beverage coaster. It's a great package that starts with new AVC encoded 1080p transfers and remixed DTS MA soundtracks of each film -- and by this point, is there any reason to re-analyze Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' legendary Saturday Matinee adventures? Each entry in the original Indy trilogy is immeasurably entertaining on its own respective merits, though fans can still quibble about which one is best.

RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK thankfully still retains its original on-screen title (despite its packaging as ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark""), and remains a classic of the action-adventure genre. With a smart Lawrence Kasdan script (from a George Lucas-Philip Kaufman story), classic stunts and Spielberg working at the peak of his talent, ""Raiders"" is pure and unadulterated fun, with Ford introducing us to the centerpiece role of his career and Karen Allen easily providing the best female love interest of the series.

Paramount's AVC encoded transfer of ""Raiders"" is much more ""contrasty"" than I've seen the movie before - and not quite as green and ""lush"", especially in the early jungle sequences -- but it's also clear this new HD scan is light years ahead of any prior video release in terms of detail. I can't recall how the film originally appeared in theaters so it's entirely possible the color scheme is also more faithful to cinematographer Douglas Slocombe's theatrical version than the prior DVD releases - certainly it's an excellent transfer overall, with fine detail visible throughout. The DTS MA soundtrack is forceful and superbly engineered, offering a broad stage for John Williams' legendary score and crisp sound effects. Three original trailers are the disc's sole extras - a short teaser (selling the film on the merits of Spielberg's past blockbusters), full theatrical trailer, and a 1983 re-release trailer (from the ""Superman"" trailer voice-over guy) are each presented in AVC encoded 1080p.

The first sequel (technically a prequel, even though it's a standalone adventure), INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM was controversial in its day (along with another Spielberg production, ""Gremlins,"" it helped create the PG-13 rating, which was initiated before the summer of '84 was out), and even now it's a nasty, violent ride compared to the other Indy adventures. The script by Lucas pals Willard Huyuck and Gloria Katz (""American Graffiti"") is silly and more excessive than either ""Raiders"" or ""The Last Crusade,"" and Kate Capshaw's whiny Willie Scott is a comedown from Karen Allen's Marion -- so much so that it's tough for ""Temple of Doom"" not to be compared unfavorably with its predecessor. Still, the movie's final third is a blast, and John Williams' majestic, triumphant score may be his most inspired of the series: his themes for the Indy-Willie romance, Short Round's Theme, the mine cart ride, and the regal music that accompanies our heroes through the jungles of India are simply spectacular, and when combined with the original ""Raiders March,"" create a phenomenal underscore that effortlessly carries the audience past the sequel's lesser aspects.

Opening with the glorious musical staging of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" (a lavish set-piece many critics rightfully noted was one of the highlights of the entire picture), ""Temple of Doom"" is the most colorful of the entire series in terms of its appearance, and the Blu-Ray's impressive HD transfer looks so natural that viewers can more easily spot discrepancies in the original cinematography (particularly during the climactic rope bridge sequence) they may not have noticed before. The soundtrack is again impressive, and both the original teaser and what appears to be an early (and underwhelming) theatrical trailer (running just a minute and with a 1983 copyright) included for extras.

The problems with the second film were rectified with the 1989 blockbuster INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, which on a surface level sounds like a ""Raiders"" rehash but adds a warm, richer emotional component through Sean Connery's magnetic performance as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. Connery is magnificent and his interplay with Harrison Ford is amusing and poignant, giving the movie an added human dimension absent from the amusement-park action of ""Temple of Doom"" and matching the level of character development found in ""Raiders."" John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott return from the original, and the movie entertainingly reprises the quest-styled plot of ""Raiders"" as Indy tries to track down his father, who was lost while searching for the Holy Grail. While ""The Last Crusade"" may lack the freshness of the original, it's right up there in terms of my personal fondness for the material - Connery and Ford are so good together that the film's strengths are only magnified on repeat viewing, and the lengthy opening sequence with River Phoenix as a younger Indy is a sheer delight, with a buoyant John Williams score to match.

Paramount's 1080p transfer is in line with the ""Raiders"" and ""Temple of Doom"" discs - displaying crisp detail and a thankful lack of DNR - while the DTS MA soundtrack is again effectively engineered. Both the film's original 1988 teaser (showing the crew at work on the sequel) and full theatrical trailer are included as well.

Shortly after INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was released, I received an email from a reader saying that I was unfairly harsh on the belated - and thoroughly unnecessary - fourth installment in the series. Frankly, after reading my original review over again, I actually don't think I was hard enough on it!

Ranking as one of the most disposable films in director Spielberg's canon, this lightly entertaining but forgettable fantasy is compromised by a leaden David Koepp script nearly completely devoid of interesting characters, wit or innovation. While Harrison Ford still fits comfortably into his iconic role - with Indy coerced into helping a group of nefarious Russians search for an ancient relic that possesses a supernatural power - the film rolls snake eyes in terms of Cate Blanchett's villainess (one of many thankless roles), Indy's relationship with a young greaser (the continually charisma-challenged Shia LaBeouf) who needs his help finding a lost archeologist (John Hurt, playing what was likely Sean Connery's role) and his kidnapped mom -- who turns out to be none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, wasted in a few minutes of screen time) herself.

The film overdoses on plot exposition (the mid-section of the picture is crushingly dull, bogged down in endless babble about the skull and its power) and fails to give its terrific cast much to do. Ford is as amiable as ever but even he seems a little ill at ease with some of the leaden dialogue, which doesn't exactly crackle the way Lawrence Kasdan, Jeffrey Boam or even Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's work did in this film's far superior predecessors.

Recalling the sluggish pacing of ""The Lost World"" (I cringe even writing that statement), little in Spielberg's direction clicks either: would-be comedic moments fall flat, while action scenes tend to exhibit a ""been there, done that"" feel at every turn. The infusion of CGI - heavily used in the movie, as it turns out -- is also in stark contrast to the prior films in the series (as is Janusz Kaminski's overly stylized cinematography, which does no favors for the picture either. It's amazing how claustrophobic and unappealing this movie looks, the bulk of it all too obviously having been shot on soundstages). Finally, the picture also greatly misses Sean Connery's warmth and humor as Indy's dad -- so much that it's unsurprising the few times ""Indy IV"" manages to strike an emotional chord is in its pair of direct references to Indy's late father (Connery was contacted to appear in the film but ultimately passed on it -- a wise maneuver in hindsight, particularly considering how well the third movie turned out). In the end, ""Crystal Skull"" commits the worst sin of all: it's completely forgettable. Five minutes after the film was over I struggled to recall the specifics of the plot or individual sequences in it, feeling as if the series truly finished with the ride off into the sunset at the end of ""The Last Crusade."" Everything about this entry, ultimately, screams too little, too late.

Paramount's HD presentation of the fourth film is on par with their prior Blu-Ray, boasting a clear 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA soundtrack. Three trailers (marked trailers 2-4) in HD round out the disc.

Trailers aside, all the supplements are included in the fifth Bonus Features disc, which one imagines will remain exclusive to the box-set, offering a satisfying mix of previously-released content and one significant new addition. Here's a breakdown:

On Set With Raiders of the Lost Ark: The set's big new extra is this hour-long compilation of behind-the-scenes footage from the production of ""Raiders."" Taken mostly from 16mm handheld camera sources with some never-before-seen outtakes from the picture mixed with candid interviews from the cast and crew - and even a few deleted scenes - fans should love this piece, which gives viewers a real, honest sense of the day-to-day shoot, both on-location and at Pinewood Studios in the UK. (HD)

Making The Films: The original 1981 ""Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from Howard Kazanjian and Phillip Schuman (57 mins.) is presented here along with Laurent Bouzereau's retrospective documentaries for ""Raiders,"" ""Temple of Doom"" and ""Last Crusade"" from the 2003 DVD box-set, each offering a 40-50 minute segment devoted to each picture (all of these segments are in standard-def). The 28-minute ""Crystal Skull"" Making Of, meanwhile, is presented in HD (a much longer version of this Making Of was included in the original, two-disc Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film).

Behind the Scenes: A number of featurettes from the 2003 DVD Indy box-set include a John Williams interview in ""The Music of Indiana Jones,"" plus ""The Stunts of Indiana Jones,"" ""The Sound of Indiana Jones,"" and ""The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones."" Brought over from the 2008 DVD release are ""Raiders: The Melting Face!"", ""Indiana Jones and the Creepy Crawlies,"" ""Travel With Indiana Jones: Locations,"" ""Indy's Women: The American Film Institute Tribute,"" and ""Indy's Friends and Enemies."" Reprieved from the original ""Crystal Skull"" release are ""Iconic Props,"" ""The Effects of Indy"" and ""Adventures in Post-Production."" Note that these ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" featurettes are presented in standard-def (the original Blu-Ray of the film offered these same segments in HD) while several other ""Crystal Skull"" featurettes from the prior release aren't included here at all.

Completists who enjoy ""Crystal Skull"" may want to hold onto the original BD release of the film for its more extensive supplements - otherwise, this set contains basically all of the extras from the prior Indy DVD releases, sans storyboard galleries.

Ultimately, Paramount has delivered a great-looking, and sonically superior, Blu-Ray set that pays tribute to the work of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Douglas Slocombe, John Williams and all the other master craftspeople involved in the production of the Indiana Jones series.

2780563,3,B000NQRE9Q,"We need more extras, behind the scenes and audio commentaries for these classics!  Raiders of the Lost Ark (and it's called just that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", not 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' - ridiculous marketing idea) is still one of the greatest movies ever made.  Temple of Doom, contrary to the blurb written in the description, is the 2nd best movie of the series.  No, Indy wasn't battling Nazis and he didn't need to.  It followed the same path as the first movie - tribute to the serials of the 1940's, it was a prequel, so it's totally fine that he was with a different girl and had a sidekick, and for the most part, the movie took itself as seriously as the first one did.  It was adventurous and bold and entertaining and had beautiful locations.  The third movie was good and had some great elements to it (like Sean Connery as his father, River Phoenix as young Indy - even with bad hair), but overall the movie became hoakie.  Think about Sala and Marcus.  In the first movie, Sala was the serious and devoted friend.  In Last Crusade, he and Marcus were comic relief, joking around and being silly - way out of character for both.  And most of the action scenes with Indy contained wisecracks for the audience, something that was never done in Raiders.  Think of the truck scene in Raiders and any of the other action scenes - there was a sense of urgency and possible doom if he failed, but in Last Crusade you always knew he would be fine because there was an element of comedy there.  In the first and second movies you are clutching your seat and hoping everything turns out okay.  In Last Crusade, you're watching and laughing, with drink in hand just going along for the ride.  The 4th movie had very few great moments - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford waited for years for just the right script and couldn't do any better?  Bringing Marion back was awesome and Ford was fun to watch.  Even Shia is a good addition as Indy's son, but the plotline, action scenes (Shia swinging with the monkeys?!) and the pacing left much to be desired.  Let's hope the next one is worlds better, is less hoakie and takes itself as seriously as the first did...",1342569600,3,2183,4.444723618090452
2780564,2,B000NQRE9Q,"1st off, I'm NOT buying any set that includes that God-Awful ""Crystal Skull"", ""Indiana-Raping"", ""movie""... and I use the term, ""movie"", loosely, because it has more in common with the garbage in my waste basket, than it does to Celluloid (or Digital) film, which was allegedly shot by a professional, and allegedly included good actors... but I digress...

Offer them individually, or at the very least, w/o the 4th ""movie"" (especially since anyone who actually wanted this garbage, likely, already purchased it -- as it's the only ""movie"" of the 4, to have been released on Blu-Ray previously!).

As for those who say, ""It's a good deal/value""... Let's examine that shall we:
Currently, the price is $75 (+ S&H for non-Prime members) -- That's $18.75 per film.  When compared to other movies, just as old & just as popular as Indiana Jones TRILOGY, who have seen past, or recent, blu-ray releases... Well, $18.75 is pretty steep, as most of those comparable films cost under $15 (and many of them under $12). __ When you factor in the fact that most people, will really only buy this set for the TRILOGY & discard, sell, or permanently shelve the 4th, you're really paying $25 for each of the 3 you want (and $25 for Temple of Doom... come on, really!?)

Plus, if that wasn't bad enough... according to the Product Details, you're not even getting anything to explain, or to excuse, the exorbitant $75 price tag. _ All the good bonus features were already included in the DVD (Trilogy) box set... And when their best selling point for these ""new features"", is, ""X minute intro by Lucas, discussing the Good & Bad"" (Temple of Doom)... and they have to intro the 3rd movie by saying ""Not as good as the first; but better than the second""... LOL... Again, you have to ask... WHY would anyone in their right mind, pay $75 to get this Set? (and I've been sorely disappointed with past Lucas, DVD to Blu-Ray transfers... especially when some of those releases didn't even contain HALF of the bonus features that their earlier, DVD counterparts included!)

Send a couple Loud, and Clear messages to No-Neck Lucas (who's looking more & more like Jabba, every year)... 1st: STOP making films... What LITTLE magic you had back in the day, has long since expired (see Indiana 4, Red Tails, Star Wars 1-3, etc.)... And 2nd: Shove this ""Set"" were the sun doesn't shine; because you know damn well that MOST people, Do Not Want The 4th (or even the 2nd)! _ (And again, many of the FEW who did like the 4th, already bought the dang thing - and you should shove it twice, for making them buy that god-awful crap, twice, just so they can get the other 3!)

Sorry - I'm extremely urked with Lucas & needed to vent. King Douche & No-Talent-Hack, whose best successes, were all produced & directed by people with Actual Talent (who he just provided the story/plot for), i.e., Willow, Indiana 1 & 3, and 2 or 3 others at most. __ But I'm not about to spend my hard earned money, on a set that includes that A**-Raping of Indie, called ""Crystal Skull""... No way. __ I guess we should at least be thankful he hasn't gone and added Gondarks or 'Sand People' or whatever.... LOL... YET.",1342483200,10,3162,4.617437722419929

2780575,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Words cannot do justice on my love for the Indiana Jones movies.

It all started back when I was 7. It was the era of the VCR, the VHS tapes and when digital cameras were in its larval stage. Me and my father watched many movies on VCR, movies like E.T., Rambo, Dirty Harry, Jurassic Park, Commando, Star Wars, Gorgo and the Godzilla movies. One day, my father and I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was my main introduction to Indiana Jones, the macho archaeologist whose search for artifacts of immense value were just an excuse to see Indy outsmart and defeat those evil Nazis and other forces trying to put him down. To say it had an impact on me is an understatement; rarely did I watch a movie that had me laughing and smiling at what was happening on screen. The scene where Indy shoots down that evil Arabic minion with a sword still resonates with me today as it did 17 years ago. After the movie was over, I found out that two more Indiana Jones movies were made: Temple of Doom (1984) and the Last Crusade (1989). Those movies were the best place to go when I was tired from school and wanted to do something with myself for the time being.

Now, me and everybody else who grew up watching the Indiana Jones movies can relive those memories in this great box-set, that also includes the unfairly maligned Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). This box set is an action fan's nirvana; each of them containing non-stop action that feels exhilarating rather than tiring, comic relief that actually provides laughs and, of course, the man with the hat and whip.

I can write numerous paragraphs on the history, impact and greatness of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy. But that can wait another day. Steven Spielberg was still reeling from the box-office disappointment of 1941 (1979). 1941 came out at a time when bloated epics like Sorcerer (1979), New York, New York (1977), At Long Last Love (1975), Popeye (1980) and, the epitome of directional excess, Heaven's Gate (1980) were box-office disasters due to their uncontrollable budget, sloppy screenwriting and its directors' strive for artistic perfection and ruined many careers (with the exception of Scorsese, who made Raging Bull afterwards). Spielberg needed a hit to prove his legitimacy in the eyes of Hollywood and, most importantly, the public.

So one day, Spielberg and his pal George Lucas (who recently made Star Wars) developed a character that was to be a cross between James Bond and Fred C. Dobbs from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Spielberg had always wanted to make a James Bond movie but Lucas added the intrigue by not only putting Bond into a world of 30's era Saturday morning matinee adventures but by turning Bond into an archaeologist. The result was Indiana Jones. To cast Jones, the two filmmakers originally wanted Tom Selleck to play the role but eventually, that part went to Harrison Ford. The rest was history.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is the work of two great filmmakers at the peak of their creative powers, making a movie that is having fun with defying expectations, adding new twists to a dated formula and making the audience have the time of their lives. The opening segment where Indy has to retrieve a golden idol head, only to be chased by booby traps and that dreaded boulder, emphasizes the movie's raw appeal. As if to dare to top one action scene after another, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford adds exciting chases (the truck chase where Indy tries to get the Ark is a classic), entertaining fist fights and an ending where the Nazis get it the hard way. Some people have complained that the movie doesn't give the audience time to breathe but that's the point. Raiders is an exhilarating ride, not an art-house movie talking about existentialism.

But this ride would have no soul or heart if it wasn't for the characters and the excellent acting. Harrison Ford really made Indy his own character; tough, obsessive in his search but also mocking his own machismo behaivor. It's hard to imagine Tom Selleck in this role before Ford came on board. As Belloq, Paul Freeman makes a slimy but genuinely intelligent rival to Indy, particularly where he lets Indy do all the dirty work, only to come back and snatching something that Indy can possess that Belloq himself can obtain. Karen Allen is wonderfully spirited as Indy's spunky love interest Marion and John Rhys-Davies (in his pre-Gimli days), Ronald Lacey and Denholm Elliott provide excellent performances in their supporting roles. The box-office revenue was well-deserved as audiences rightly ignored those curmudgeon critics and made this one of the top-grossing movies of all time.

2.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom-Special-Edition-1984/dp/B0014Z4ON4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition) (1984)</a>

Before Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Temple of Doom was often considered the weakest of all Indiana Jones movies. Out of all the Indiana Jones movies, Doom is regarded as the darkest and (to some people) the most mean-spirited due to its shocking violence (the heart-ripping scene...I shall say no more), annoying heroine (played by future Spielberg wife Kate Capshaw) scare factor and its patronizing attitude towards Indians, a fair assessment but then again, many Saturday matinee cliffhangers were not exactly politically correct, either. It is a combination of these factors, plus the release of Gremlins (1984), that led to the idea of a PG-13 rating by the MPAA.

Yet, with the exception of its ""racism"" towards Indians, Temple of Doom deserves a re-evaluation on its negative aspects that are actually considered the reasons why this movie works. Spielberg plunges into the darkness and shows us the ugly side of his archaeological hero, having Indy and his pals Capshaw and Short Round, play by Goonies actor Ke Huy Quan, confront Chinese gangsters, hideous bugs, spiked ceilings caving in, voodoo magicians, a fragile bridge and man-eating crocodiles. But to talk about the dark aspect is to say that Doom is depressing. On the contrary, Doom is actually funnier and wittier than its predecessor. The scene where Indy and his friends are forced to eat a dinner of bugs, monkey brains, eels within giant snakes and a soup of eyeballs may have been too gross for audiences' taste but in Spielberg's hands, it comes across as boldly hilarious rather than appallingly tasteless.

And like Raiders, Doom moves at a brisk, electric pace, making the action more exciting and the comedy funnier. The mine cart chase near the end ranks as one of the most exciting set-pieces in all the Indiana Jones movies and epitomizes the movie's appeal: bold, scary, maybe violent but still fun, enjoyable and one hell of a ride to go back on.

3.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Last-Crusade-Special-Edition-1989/dp/B0014C2FX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition) (1989)</a>

Regretting the darkness of Temple of Doom, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas went back to the lighter approach of Raiders with The Last Crusade. Not only do Spielberg and Lucas begin the movie with a prologue depicting Indy as a youngster but they also bring in Mr. Bond himself, Sean Connery, as Ford's father. In addition, Davies and Elliott, who were mere supporting players in Raiders, are brought back and given more substantial roles. Even the Nazis have returned as the primary villains, with Hitler making a memorable cameo appearance.

Instead of making Crusade feel recycled and hackneyed, it actually makes the movie feel bittersweet and even melancholic, as the fact that this was going to be the final Indy movie (at the time, at least) was obvious. The final scene where the four main characters ride off to the sunset makes Last Crusade feel more like an elegiac western straight out of Shane (1953) and The Searchers (1956) than something out of James Bond movie. But enough about contemplating sadness.

Is this just as exciting as the previous Indy movies? Hell yes. The motorcycle chase that occurs after Indy rescues his father at a Nazi compound is first-rate, as are scenes where Indy and his companion Elsa voyage under the rat-infested sewers of Venice before attempting to outsmart their enemies in a thrilling boat chase. But what's an Indiana Jones without a wit? Take, for example, the scene where Connery scares off a flock of seagulls to crash a German plane into oblivion. It is one of the wittiest ways to defeat an imposing enemy ever depicted on celluloid.

Speaking of Connery, it is his chemistry with Ford that is the heart of the picture. From their first meeting onward, Ford and Connery cut the father-and-son relationship deep, making their bond more palpable when Indy is forced to go through a ritual to ""choose wisely"" the one cup that will save his father's lives. Given the father-and-son relationship, it's little wonder why many fathers and uncles prefer The Last Crusade as their favorite Indiana Jones movie. The final scenes where Ford addresses Connery as ""Yes, sir"" as the main characters ride off to the sunset establishes the kind of genuine emotion that only Spielberg could achieve and illustrates why this trilogy is a breed apart from all the other mindless anthologies that favor explosions over expositions.

So that completes the Indiana Jones trilogy...

Oh, wait a minute. That's right.

We have one more business to take care of.

Few series installments are as utterly reviled by die-hard fans as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull. Released in 2008, Crystal Skull has become the object of derision and parody by a majority of people, including the creators of South Park. But the reasons that this movie are hated range from vague to downright absurd. But we'll dissect it anyway and then I'll offer a defense to the movie's ""shortcomings"".

1.) The movie is too silly, too unrealistic, the ""nuke the fridge"" scene standing out as the example of this. Right. And a scene in Temple of Doom where a guy is still breathing after having his heart ripped out is so much MORE realistic. And while we're at it, let's talk about how, in the beginning of Raiders, Indiana Jones just so happens to run into his friend's seaplane after going on a lengthy journey (with a foreign crew, I should mention) to pursue the golden idol. Anybody going to an Indiana Jones movie expecting realism is kidding themselves. The Indiana Jones movies were never about accuracy, realism or authenticity.

2.) Harrison Ford is too old to play the part. Well, gee, since the last Indiana movie came out nearly 20 years before and the fact that this one is set in the 1950's, did you honestly think Ford was going to get any younger? Speaking of 1950's:

3.) There's ALIENS in an Indiana Jones movie and the main villains are Russian. Given the fact that this movie is set in the 50's, the decade of the communist witch hunt, the Cold War and the fact that it was the golden age of science-fiction cinema like War of the Worlds (1953), Forbidden Planet (1956), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Invaders from Mars (1953), you would think these people would not make a hissy-fit about it. But even if this were set in the 40's, it still wouldn't matter because the Saturday matinee serials and adventures that inspired Indiana Jones also covered science-fiction, jungle adventures and espionage. So to say that Crystal Skull disrespects the Indiana Jones name because it features aliens is wrong, considering the origin of the movies and the aspects of that origin.

And 4.) This movie has CGI. Probably the only critique that I would consider valid but if you're really that nit-picking over a few special effects shots, I feel very sorry for you.

As for the movie itself, the movie no way holds a candle to the three previous installments but on its own, it's very good and enjoyable to watch. The acting and action scenes are solid and Spielberg's use of framing and camera angles have very few peers. A much more serious shortcoming is that the movie drags in the middle section and that Blanchett is way over-the-top, compared to the villains in the previous movies. But even with such quibbles, Kingdom of Crystal Skull is a very good, if not great Indy installment that deserves better than to be recognized as a target of some idiotic Comedy Central cartoon.

Bottom Line:

No serious movie fan would be complete without the four Indiana Jones movies (or three if you hate Indy 4 that much). To have them on a slim thinpak with great picture and audio quality makes this treasure to re-watch again and again. When it comes to Indiana Jones movies, there's no better place to discover some ""fortune and glory"".

However, I was appalled at the quality of the packaging. Cheap feeling slim DVD cases where the inserts don't even fit well; one is cracked, and on another the central button that's meant to keep the disc in place broke off at some point before it was taken from the shrink wrap.

My guestion is, When these films were released in a 4-disc Ultimate Collection DVD, is it actually worth upgrading these films on the Blu-Ray format. The price of $74.99 is a bit high for these films, but like I said Indiana Jones I, II and III were spectacular and flawless and still hold up 31 years after the release of Raiders.  Does anybody know what special features are going to be available on this Blu-Ray collection?  Thank You in advance for responding.  Also, I do own a 52"" Sony HDTV, and I also have a Blu-Ray player.  I still have a VHS player and a DVD player.  I really don't care what format a movie will be released on to.  I have been a film buff for the past 25 years.  I own 5,006 movies.  286 on Blu-Ray, 2,996 on DVD and 1,724 on VHS.  I have also watched thousands of films that I don't own.

I'm just glad that these films are not the sole property of Lucas.
(otherwise I can see -in Raiders- when the army truck with Marion 'inside' blows up, we'd hear Indy shriek ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"")

Now, that might have been what Indy said to Marcus Brody when he handed over the Cross of Coronado in the ""Last Crusade"", but it expresses the sentiment on Indyfans for years now --- and with the release of The Blu Ray Collection I can speak for all of them when I say ""It's about time""!

Cannot wait to see the extras - and I know it isn't Mr. Spielberg's way, but a Director's commentary or that great Q&A the had at the 30th anniversary screening with LA Times Geof Boucher, that also included Harrison Ford would be great to see on the set. If not than Indyfanatics can view the great fan documentary like ""Raiding the Lost Ark"" by Jamie Benning out on the internet, or watch the documentary about Indyfans called -- what else ""Indyfans""! And why stop there - while you can wait to watch the Blu Ray - you can always listen to the Indiana Jones podcast - the IndyCast!

2780605,2,B000NQRE9Q,"The original is a classic romp of the most fun sort.  Nothing really compares in cinema history.  Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all, from Ford's stoic Indy portrayal to Allen's flinty sidekick/love interest to a smug Frenchman and a fastidious Englishman and a noble Egyptian, not to mention the most vile collection of evil Nazis ever filmed.  Snakes, planes, ships, traps, narrow escapes, and a seemingly never ending series of fist pumping victories over the bad guys.

After the limp and silly Temple of Doom, Indy roared back with Sean Connery in tow as Indiana's father, for the series' only worthy sequel, as the Jones' scramble to find that which King Arthur's knights could not, the Holy Grail.  Like the first one, this one is non-stop fun and action.

Whatever possessed Lucas and Spielberg to resurrect the franchise for the insulting Crystal Skull is beyond my understanding.  Ford is way too old for the action, so the world's most annoying actor, Shia LeBouef, is inserted as Indy's and Marion's bastard son, and LeBoeuf is relentlessy irritating.  Even Cate Blanchett can't save this mess, and her talent is largely squandered on a two-dimensional character.

Just like the Star Trek films, only the odd numbered ones are worth a damn.  But when they're good, they're great fun and worth repeated watchings on an annual basis.",1320192000,7,1343,4.928888888888889

Kingdom of the Crystal Skull comes as the 2-disc special edition, which is a nice touch. However, we are somewhat reliant on closed captioning and the implementation here is awful.

Doctor Jones is a kind of character that fits the mold of the adventurer of the films of the thirties and forties. I had seen Raiders when it came out in the theater, and at that time each Saturday on our local PBS station had a program called Matinee at the Bijou, which showed a feature, a serial, and a cartoon, just as they were shown in theaters for a nickel during the thirties. Raiders could have been cut up into scenes and shown as a serial. It has that 'cliff hanging' feel to it. The other films are similar, though I think Raiders still holds the tone of things like Flash Gordon, Superman, and Gene Autry and the gang at Radio Ranch.

I had seen Crystal Skull in the theater the first weekend, but I'm still saving that, perhaps to pair up with Raiders, a sort of Marion then, and Marion later.",1270857600,,977,4.136842105263158
2780642,4,B000NQRE9Q,"With an almost $2 Billion(!)worldwide gross so far(theatrical take only,this doesn't include DVDs and related merchandise),the Indiana Jones movie franchise has certainly been one of the most successful of its kind in movie history. Certainly with its throwback to the old movie serial story arcs,the plots and action have continued to hold up extremely well. Now with the release of this five DVD set,they are now bundled into one package for your convenience;""Raiders of the Lost Ark""(June,1981),""I.J.and the Temple of Doom""(May,1984),""I.J.and the Last Crusade""(May,1989) and""I.J. and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""(May 2008).
""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" concerns the story of and search for the Ark of the Covenant. Set in 1936 the movie opens with Dr. Jones(Ford)in the Peruvian jungle trying to obtain a golden idol head. Through some remarkably tense moments he does so but barely escapes with his life. Just as he thinks he is home free a Frenchman and rival by the name of Belloq(Paul Freeman)confiscates the head. Jones flees for his life and just makes it out. Back home he is approached by Government agents who put him onto a search for the fabled Ark of the Covenant. His first stop is Nepal and his old friend Dr. Ravenwood who has an important artifact and clue. But he has passed away and his daughter Marion(Karen Allen),with whom he has had ""contact"" before,has possession of the artifact. Before Indy can obtain it Nazis show up also looking for it. Marion and Indy flee to Cairo where they meet up with old friend Sallah(John Rhys Davies)who helps Indy with men,materiel and and his vast local knowledge. After more harrowing times Indy finds the location of the Ark and they just manage to escape with it to England aboard ship;from under the nose of his rival Belloq(who is working with the Germans).But they are intercepted and taken to an island in the Mediterranean to test the Ark. It is opened and a tied up Indy and Marian look away as the Ark's powers destroy the Nazi's.
""I.J.and the Temple of Doom"" is set in 1935 and opens with Indy trying to get himself out of the clutches of a Chinese gang in a nightclub in Shanghai. With another hot and fast opening like the previous film,Indy barely manages his escape,but does so with the help of young friend called Short Round(Ke Huy Quan-better known from ""Goonies"") and accompanied reluctantly by club singer Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw).They flee in an airplane which is unfortunately owned by the self same crime boss he just escaped from. Over the Himalayas the pilots jump out leaving Indy and company to their own devices. They escape near death with the help of a self-inflating raft pushed out the plane and down into a river. They end up in a village which has come upon vary hard times. According to the leader it is because their sacred Sivalinga stone has been taken to the Pankot Palace,where an ancient cult has again arisen to enslave the land and its' peoples,especially the children. Indy goes to the palace and and at first all appears normal until he stumbles onto the truth and finds that a cult is indeed trying to rise up through possession of a number of Savalinga stones. Through more harrowing and life threatening moments Indy retrieves the villages' stone and returns it along with its' previously enslaved children.
""I.J.and the Last Crusade"" starts out with a young Indy in 1912 out with a boy scout troop on horse back. He stumbles upon a group of men who have unearthed the Cross of Coronado and which Indy believes belongs in a museum. He steals it from the men and through a very long chase on horseback,on a train and finally on foot he makes it back home;only to have the local Sheriff take it from him and give it to the ""rightful"" owner. Fast forward to 1938 and he is on board a freighter and the self same ""rightful""owner is taking back that self same cross from Indy once again. This time Indy escapes with the cross and the owner and ship both go down together. After being back home a Mr Donovan(Julian Glover) approaches Indy with a proposition to find the Holy Grail,telling him a party of men he has hired has gone missing including its' guide;the guide being Indy's father. With the help of his fathers' diary which he received recently in the mail,he goes first to Venice and meets a rep of Donovan's;a Dr Schneider. She accompanies him during which time he uncovers a tomb of one of the knights of the Crusades and a clue to the starting point of his search. After  many tense moments with a group dedicated to keeping the Holy Grail a secret,Jones leaves for Salzburg to rescue his father Dr Jones Sr(Sean Connery).From here both Jones's end up in Turkey and in a cave filled with booby traps. The Nazi's(again,and with Dr. Schneider being one of them)force Indy to go through three deadly traps and into the grail room. It is guarded by one of the original knights who tells him to choose wisely. Donovan is there and chooses unwisely but the cup is not fated to leave the cave and all the good guys barely escape with their lives. The film ends with all riding into a glorious sunset.
""I.J.the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" finds us in 1957 with a fast moving convoy of Army trucks. They come upon a fenced off restricted area and shoot the guards there. We soon find out they are Commies and Indy and a former friend McHale(Ray Winstone)have been kidnapped. They are in Nevada at an Area 51 warehouse and the Soviets,led by Spalko(Cate Blanchett),want Jones to retrieve a case containing an alien body that Jones himself and others unearthed 10 years before in Roswell(Jones was unaware of the contents until then).After escaping the warehouse Indy stumbles into a peaceful""town"" only to find it is a phony,one that is in range of a nuclear bomb which is ready to detonate. Indy survives by hiding in a refrigerator and getting blasted into the desert. After decontamination Indy is grilled by the FBI who thinks he's working wuith the Commies. When the FBI later show up at the college where he works the college decides to let him go,not wanting the adverse publicity. Aboard his train leaving Indy is approached by a Mutt Williams(Shia LaBeouf)who says his old professor and friend Dr Oxley(John Hurt) and his mother have been kidnapped in Peru. Off they go and they find Oxley had been in a mental facility there but had since left. However he left behind clues to his whereabouts. They discover a temple with a crystal skull(in the shape of an alien head) and shortly after are captured by the Soviets. In their camp on the Amazon they find Dr Oxley and Mutt's mother Marion Ravenswood(Karen Allen),who tells Indy Mutt is his son(!).After a harrowingly pitched battle run through the jungle,Indy and the gang escape the Commies and find the fabled Akator city where the skull originally came from and a room ringed with skeletal crystal aliens. It seems these are inter dimensional beings and when the crystal head is replaced onto its' proper body it transforms from several into one alien, which comes alive. Spalko takes the knowledge she seeks from the Alien with her to her grave while the rest of the gang barely make it out alive. Indy and party watch as a giant flying saucer rises from beneath the temple rubble and vanishes. The film ends with Indy and Marion finally marrying.
The last film puts a wonderful""cap"" on the entire series as it comes full circle with Marion and Indy marrying. The ending also leaves us with a possible opening for a future Indiana Jones movie,but if this turns out to be the last with Harrison Ford,it couldn't go out in any better fashion. Ford climbs into his Indy character here without so much as a hiccup and its shows how he has made the part very much his own.
I think the weakest of the lot here is ""Doom"",with the first one being the best and the others just a tad below that. I used to think ""Crusade"" was the weakest but I have gained a new appreciation for the film I originally hadn't had in its' first run.
All the DVDs come with their own multiple special features including trailers,featurettes,new intros by Spielberg and Lucas,photo galleries and more. The only difference in them is that the ""Crystal Skull"" comes with an extra disc for its special features. The films have all been transferred wonderfully and there are no complaints here at all in picture or sound. All are presented in their original aspect ratio widescreen format and are beautiful to behold. Each disc comes in their own individual slim case.
If you wanted the entire series of Indiana Jones features,these are the ones to get. Each movie has its' patented boffo opening designed to pull you into the film as soon as possible and heart pounding finish,and generally all succeed famously. In between the two are some of the most memorable moments of adventure ever filmed. It's a throwback to the serials of the 30s and 40s for sure but with a more modern sensibility and better special effects. Ford is solid from his first appearance to his last and they couldn't have picked a better man for the job. Get your set of adventures right now!",1268524800,,9103,4.710790464240904

2780646,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I remember being 7 years old and walking in to the opening night show of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. After several viewings in as many theaters as I could find it in over the years (found it in an IMAX theater once... WOW!), and the approximately 200 times I've seen it I've seen it on both VHS (standard and widescreen) and then the beauteous 4-disc Trilogy set with the supplemental features disc... well, let's just leave it with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is my favorite film ever. Despite its miniscule flaws in historical accuracy and a few shot-continuity errors, it's a perfect film. Humongously entertaining with great effects (certainly for 1981!), terrific acting, sparkling dialogue, and a breathless pace, it's the perfect piece of Hollywood entertainment.

INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, which suffers at times from a very average script, other continuity errors in the Indy mythology, and a lackluster female lead, still manages to be very entertaining and heart-stopping (pun intended), and Ford is still as charming as ever.

INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is near-perfect. Spielberg recovers from the somewhat dark prequel with a bright, engaging, and extremely entertaining final act to the Indy Trilogy. Certain character moments are bothersome, but it reunites the original cast members (sans Karen Allen) and adds Dr. Henry Jones Sr., with a spot-on performance by Sean Connery. Who else but James Bond could be the father of Indiana Jones?

So there you have it. Probably the best trilogy of all time.

UNTIL...

Hey, understand this first, for the people hating on Spielberg for the celluloid crime that is INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL: This film was hardly directed by Spielberg. In fact, this film has George Lucas's tacky, CGI-heavy, sci-fi fetish fingerprints ALL OVER IT. It looks like one of the STAR WARS prequels set on our planet instead of something a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. There were so many times that I prayed there would be a fourth film, but that was back in the 1990's. The EARLY TO MID 1990's, when Harrison Ford hadn't become a Hollywood joke yet. But the mere fact that it was 19 years after the previous Indy adventure should have been convincing enough for anyone to just stay away. If anyone was pushing for this film to be made, it was Ford, who has slowly been watching his star become dimmer and dimmer over the last decade and a half. This is a film that so clearly did NOT need to be made that it boggles the mind why it did.

Now, I'm not one of those ""Lucas Raped My Childhood"" idiots. Despite the return of Karen Allen and the additions of great actors like Ray Winstone, Cate Blanchett and John Hurt... this is just a film that never needed to happen. It felt like a poor excuse to bring these people together again. And the film itself has nothing redeeming about it. It has a climax that literally had me thinking I had somehow fallen asleep and woke up in another film, uninspired action set pieces, and its complete reliance on CG rather than practical effects just makes it that much harder to watch. Believe me when I say that I wanted SO BADLY to love this film, but even while watching it... I knew that something had gone very wrong.

So three films of varying degrees of excellence and one film that just doesn't do anything... My advice: Get it anyway and gift KOTCS to your niece or nephew. Kids will probably like it. Because having the first three films is more than worth it.",1265500800,4,3491,4.657467532467533

The extras are great, and I really enjoyed them. Some of the older making of stuff is a bit more slow than I'd like, but very informative. The cover of the book part and the outside are embossed and look really really nice. I won't review the movies themselves as most people reading this, already own the dvds and are wondering if they should upgrade. The answer is yes. All the movies are fun, and even though Crystal Skull got a lot of heat, I think when people take a breather and just relax and watch it you will find it gets better and better each time you see it. Sure it's over the top but they all are. And well the russians aren't as fun to hate as the Nazis, but it's period specific and accurate. It puts indy in his right age bracket (to match the stars age) and it's overally pretty fun. I can't imagine anyone who has seen the movie and saw Harrison Ford unceremoniously taken out of a trunk of the car and then tossed onto the ground, where he picks up his hat, and in a bit of clever shadow play puts the hat on. Anyone who saw that and didn't get chills isn't a true Indy fan. I'd highly recommend this purchase. Though I am still unsure whether there will be a fifth movie or not, and how that will fit in with this set if it is made. But, oh well. I'll probably wear them out by then anyway.

Indiana Jones was a household name as I was growing up and that was the primary reason I bought this set. But considering the poor audio quality, I would really advice any one to buy the single film editions, especially if you have the first three already.

Since the fourth movie was coming out this year I decided that it was finally time to watch the series... and I had a blast doing so. These are fun, campy movies.

This set is ideal for new fans such as myself or for fans who don't own any of the movies on DVD. You get all four of the movies in a nice-looking box set plus the second disc from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Special Edition DVD.

My only complaint would be a lack of special features from the original three films, but that's to be expected with older movies before all these behind-the-scenes features were the norm.

I bought the pack because I wanted all of the Indiana Jones movies in one fell swoop and this was pretty good price.  I hadn't seen the latest one and that was a plus, as well.

My favorite is still Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - I watch that one over and over.  I like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but the new one, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has the number 2 spot for me.  It was adventerous and exciting and intersting since Harrison Ford is so much older.  The ending was a little different holding open the idea of a newer, younger Indiana Jones, but perhaps not...

2780693,2,B000NQRE9Q,"INDIANA JONES-THE COMPLETE ADVENTURE COLLECTION is a four DVD set collection of the four Indiana Jones films. For those who don't know, the four Indiana Jones movies are:

RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (that's the original title; I resist Lucas revisionism as much as possible)
INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM
INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE
INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL

The first three films were released in the spring of 2008 as special edition discs. The only thing new here is the inclusion of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. Other than that movie and the extras that are included with it, there is nothing else new here.

Therefore, if you already have purchased the first three movies, just buy a copy of INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULL (it has the same extras that are included on this disc) and save yourself thirty or forty dollars. If you don't own those movies, I'd still advise you buy them separately. Prices have dropped since the special edition DVDs were released in the spring and you can buy all four of the individual movies for a total of about $5-$10 less for what it costs for this boxed set.",1227052800,,1164,4.586538461538462

I understand that the dvd industry is forcing people to buy these as their only choice if they want to own the movie, but they lost my business and I don't think I'm alone in wondering why both formats can't be offered on dvd sets..full and wide screen...so we the comsumer can actually feel like we are in control of choosing the type of product we would like to purchase instead of ""settling"" for all that we can get.

2780699,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Okay, I believe we all know who Indiana Jones, is, right? I grew up with Indy and my kids will be the same. This new box-set is the definitive Indy box-set. This set features the original classic trilogy plus the newest addition, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". Just like the set that came out in May for the 4th movie, this set comes with the new special editions of the original 3 movies. The best part about this set is that the 4th movie is the 2-Disc special edition and not the lame 1-disc version. My only complaints with this set are 1) that the DVD cases are those really lame slim cases and not regular sized DVD cases and 2) the bonus disc from the original trilogy boxset is missing (although the special features makeup for that is most respects) and 3) while the cover is cool, the order of each movie cover is weird; you start from the top right and work your way around. All in all, this is the best Indy box-set out there and it's worth getting. Here's my ratings for each movie:

Raiders of the Lost Ark: 5/5
The Temple of Doom: 4/5
The Last Crusade: 5/5
The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: 3.5/5",1224115200,280,1116,4.289099526066351

The issue is that there will be a new, more exhaustive and comprehensive box coming in the next six months. It's coming. Don't be fooled!

If you must have the new movie now, then just buy the one disc. Wait for the new collection later.

That being said - the transfers and quality of the DVD's within are good. The special features are fine. It's complete now with all 4 films, which is nice. But I'm all for having one copy of every movie that I love, and not duplicate my collection by buying something which is bound to be obsolete shortly.",1224115200,50,610,4.333333333333333

2780702,4,B000NQRE9Q,"Cursed Amazon, they lump DVD and BLU-RAY reviews together, I had to delete my DVD review to add this one.

I was a bit hesitant when I heard they had done a frame-by-frame restoration of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but nothing with Temple of Doom or Last Crusade, however, my concerns were not necessary. ""Raiders"" probably looks as good as it did the day it was shot. Sure, it's got 35mm grain, but that's better than THX noise reduction creating an oil-painted look. What you do get is a clean, crisp, vibrant print that leaps from the screen, thundering, full sound and the besting sounding John Williams score this side of Star Wars.

Everyone has their opinions on the films, I don't have my favorite. All those who talk about the second film being too dark and violent overlook the ""death by propeller"" and ""face melting"" scenes, those who said ""kingdom skull"" was too plot heavy or silly overlook the monkey (sorry the monkey was a jar-jar moment) saying ""uh oh"" or the ""just don't look at it and it won't kill us"" ending (and a refrigerator saving him from nuclear blast is silly?)

I thoroughly enjoy all four of these films, there funny, exciting, and completely entertaining and unlike anything else. These blu-rays look/sound fantastic, as sharp and vibrant as you cold hope for. My daughters aren't the biggest fans, yet, but I'm sure my son and I will enjoy them for years.",1223942400,12,1385,4.644897959183673

This collection is about grabbing some popcorn and sitting on the couch all day with your family and everyone having a great time.  Unless you have been living under a rock you know what this movie franchise is all about.
This collection is the same one that was for sale prior to the release of the last movie The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (stars are my opinion)

It contains;

Raiders *****
Temple of Doom *
The Last Crusade *****
(new)The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. ****

Also included are some documentaries that were filmed during the making of the films. Making of documentaries make this a must have for the Indy collector.
The Indiana Jones franchise may be getting long in the tooth but I think that this collection is a great pack of movies to have.

2780704,3,B000NQRE9Q,"I love Indiana Jones. Though it seems ridiculous that at 65 Ford can do all those stunts, especially at his age, Shia does a great job and so does Karen.
Number 4 is NO WHERE as good as the other 3 but it was still enjoyable fun to watch these stars go on yet another adventure.
But does anyone know if this box set contains the special editions recently released?",1223683200,3,364,4.214285714285714
2780705,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This set contains the four cinematic adventures of Indiana Jones. Raiders is a classic piece of cinema. A brilliantly directed action adventure film paying homage to adventure serials of the 30s. Temple of Doom pays similar homage, but takes Indy into horror and fantasy territory. Doom is extremely polished and lavish, personally I love it equally with Raiders. Last Crusade brings back the popular elements of Raiders, along with Sean Connery as his father. There is some brilliant dialogue in this film  and banter between them. It's probably the most family oriented of the original three. Then we have Crystal Skull, the new instalment. Personally I enjoyed it and think it is a worthy entry into the sage of Indiana Jones. There are some over the top moments, but like Temple of Doom before it, the film really pushes the fantasy elements of the action scenes. Marion Ravenwood is back and well, I won't spoil it.  It's great to see Indy back after 20 years.  Buy this set, you will watch all the films over and over again!",1223596800,9,1030,4.775280898876405
2780706,3,B000NQRE9Q,"Cheesy fun. That's all it is. If you're expecting realism or drama or the Godfather, you're barking up the wrong tree. If you're looking for 8 hours of cheesy fun, best accompanied by a bottle of vodka, then look no further.

And if you're wondering about the fourth movie, don't worry. The ending very clearly emphasizes that Shia is NOT replacing Harrison, and there will only be one Indy :)

The only big reason that I can see against buying this boxset is as follows: will this be the last one? I doubt it. Personally, I'm waiting for the fifteen-disc, six-movie box to be released... and you know it'll happen :)",1223251200,7,617,4.54954954954955
2780707,5,B000NQRE9Q,"This movie was awesome! He still has the touch to make action and comedy blend together. Sure, he's alot older now than when he did the last crusade, but that's the beauty of it. I think he's in great shape for his age and did alot of his own stunts in it. Shia, I could do without. I think he's a bit overblown. Lucas/Spielberg/Ford are talking about doing another one but even they admit they would have to hurry because Ford is getting any younger to do these sort of things. I love the way it ends. Lucas has already said Shia will NOT replace Ford. And the end proves it if you pay attention to it. It's masterfull the way they let the fans know there is and always will be one Indy!!",1222992000,6,689,4.149253731343284
2780708,4,B000NQRE9Q,"I can only hope that this is the last adventure Indian Jones will be on. The biggest thing I've noticed about this movie is that I can really see Harrison Ford had a hell of a time making this picture.
This film is much better than I anticipated.",1222819200,2,246,4.145833333333333
2780709,5,B000NQRE9Q,"Let me be very fair by stating that this film is beautifully recreated in Blu-Ray with all the special effects and sound seemingly amplified! It's a beauty!

However, the fourth installment of ""Indiana Jones"" is a disappointment. The entrance scene with Indiana and his fedora in a silhouette is a nice start, but the film's plot quickly disintegrates into implausibility. Now, I do understand the Saturday `Flash Gordon' type stories where credibility is stretched for entertainment, but this film stretches and breaks. Marion is back (Karen Allen) and her entrance is so very welcome, but she soon disappears into a one-dimensional character. Indiana's new side-kick (Shia LaBeouf) misses his mark and only annoys when constantly slicking back his hair (thanks to George Lucas). John Hurt is such a great actor, it hurts to see him delegated to barely speaking, but his face tells a lot more than the dialogue around him. Cate Blanchett is thoroughly believable as the commie villain, but her character is also `dumbed-down'.

The action scenes are not as inventive as previous Indiana Jones films (remember the first 15 minutes of ""Temple of Doom"" from the dance number, ""Anything Goes"" to jumping out a three-story building to a car chase to jumping out of a plane in a raft to sliding down a snow peaked glacier to dropping off a cliff into a wild raging river and on and on...?) There is nothing like that here. There is a floating car with our heroes that goes over numerous gigantic waterfalls and no one gets hurt (only a little wet). The car chase scene on the cliff never gets too exciting and to see LaBeouf swinging on vines ala Tarzan is just TOO much to have the audience believe. Do I need to add the scene where Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that is blown a mile away? And finally, I apologize, but the ""Close Encounters"" ending is fairly dramatic, but with all that torrential water gushing, mountains collapsing and the winds hurling around the characters, why don't their clothes or hair move at all? It is the most egregious CGI overlook since George Lucas (""Return Of The Jedi"") had Mark Hamill fly through the redwood forest on the air-scooters and the ferns didn't move at all.

Like I said, I tried to be fair. It is still a great film compared to most that is out there. But when Lucas and Spielberg set the bar SO high with previous works, they can't top themselves and that hurts - kind of like growing up and realizing your heroes are really ordinary people. But it's still worth watching (or owning), if only for its historical significance and the beautifully filmed scenery (in Blu-Ray!!!) Get the first three in Blu-Ray as well (when available). The difference will make the films seem like new!",1222128000,,2756,4.7615062761506275
