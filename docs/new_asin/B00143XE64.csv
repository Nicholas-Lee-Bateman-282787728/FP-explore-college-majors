3121855,4,B00143XE64,"The Story

One Piece is a story set in a time called the Great Pirate Era focused on one ragtag group of pirates. In this DVD set you'll meet: Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the crew and user of the Gum Gum fruit; Roronoa Zoro, master swordsman and former bounty hunter; Nami, skilled thief who preys on pirates, and; Usopp, an infamous liar and wannabe pirate. Although by the end of this set they won't be officially a crew, the observant will notice their visages on the box art, so you know it's coming.

The entire first season tells the story of how Luffy brought his crew together before they headed to the Grand Line. We'll also get to see the back-stories for all of the characters, which is a real treat indeed, but we'll only get to see that for two of them in this set. We actually don't get to see all the members of Luffy's crew in this set, we'll need to wait until the next one for that.

When I started watching One Piece using fansubs, I was turned off by the romantic hero-pirate gag. ""Pirates don't act like that, how dumb,"" I said to myself. The very premise of the show, Luffy's wholehearted desire to get the mystical 'One Piece', didn't fit with the character initially. Luffy is a self-serving pirate aiming for riches and glory, but then he does many self-less things, so how can he really be a pirate?

However, like I did with Naruto (which I also needed to get used to), I gave One Piece a chance to show its muster. Man am I glad I did. After a while I ignored the only passing resemblance to pirates that the crew had and let myself get lost in the story instead.

One Piece's story is dynamic. At times it is hilarious and fun, and then moments later it can be intense and dramatic. The story is top-notch and certainly deserving of the reader's interest. I saw the snowball metaphor used to describe this story and I would have to concur.

The Art

The characters in One Piece are imaginative and well drawn, as are the locations that they go to.  One Piece's animation and artwork are good, but not great. You're not going to be awed by any special effects in this or any future sets. This doesn't detract from the show for myself, but if you're the type that desires excellent art, you may want to look elsewhere. The art here is probably comparable to the art in Naruto or Pokemon, which is something you'd expect from a longer running show.

The Acting

Voice acting is alright. I might be a bit biased in this regard, since I've watched so much of One Piece with Japanese dubs, but I prefer the Japanese dubs to the English ones. Fortunately, you have your choice of both English and Japanese in this set, so there's no need to choose.

I would have to say that the translation is better than those found in fansubs. When Luffy pops out of the barrel in front of a couple of pirates, he says, ""Who the hell are you?"" and they reply, ""Who the hell are YOU?!"", which is far funnier than the fansub translation you'll find on the internet. This is just one example, but you'll find that the acting is pretty decent. Personally, I think their choice to have certain 'rough' characters enunciate their words perfectly to be a little off-putting, but it could be that the Japanese is the same way. I don't know since I don't speak Japanese.

Over all, I'd say that the voice acting is well done, but so far there hasn't been a real chance for the actors to flex their vocal talents (although I'm sure it takes a lot for them to speak in some of the more raspy voices like Luffy's or Buggy's).

One thing parents will want to take note of is that there is a plentiful supply of swearing. If you're looking for a show for your youngin's to watch, you may need to look elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll find the word choices to be tasteful and fulfilling.

The Music

Ah, music, one of the more important aspects of video entertainment. Since One Piece is about pirates, you'd expect 'piratey' music, which you'll find plenty of. When there is an action scene, there is fast-paced music to set the mood. Likewise for dramatic moments.

The music in this part of One Piece doesn't drive the mood as much as it does in later episodes, but it certainly isn't a let down either. Many of the characters will end up having their own theme music played when they are in intense fight scenes, and that is when you'll really notice the quality of it.

The Hardware

This set comes in two attractive slim-cases with an equally attractive cardboard sleeve to keep them together. The episodes included on each disc are listed on the back of the cases, rather than listed on a small slip of paper nestled in some large casing holding multiple discs. This set up is easier and more convenient than the Naruto uncut boxed sets which have the aforementioned large case. I don't have much of a plastic fetish, so the physical media and casing don't matter to me much. It does its job well and doesn't get in my way.

The Set

The set is called One Piece - Season 1, First Voyage. It's important to note the qualifier 'First Voyage', since this set doesn't actually contain the whole first season. If you check IMDB, you'll find out that the first season contained a whopping 47 episodes, which means that it will take four sets like this one to cover the entire first season of One Piece. That's a lot of money to get just the first season of a cartoon that is 360+ episodes strong.

FUNimation could have at least finished out the Usopp storyarc rather than leave us hanging, but this seems to be standard anime studio practice since the Naruto boxed sets also have a comparable amount of episodes per set. It's a stupid, greedy, practice in my opinion. You can get the Heroes or House M.D. first seasons for nearly the same price, but while with this set we get 312 minutes of entertainment, with those sets you get 1035 and 1050 minutes respectively. That's over three times as much content! This is the main reason this set doesn't get five stars from me. One would have to have a very convincing reason other than greed to justify this aspect of this set and other comparable sets.

Conclusion

So now comes the recommendation. To buy, or not to buy? That is the question. My heart yells a resounding ""Yes!"", but my mind says to be cautious with such a purchase. I bought this set largely to support the creation of the show itself, since I have already watched the entire series through fansubs I downloaded. This means that I already knew what I was getting in to and that I was already prepared to be gouged by FUNimation for such a measly amount of content. I wasn't sold on this series until around episode 30, which is approximately two sets away.

I'm an unrepentant downloader of fansubs and an equally zealous purchaser of the anime series I watch. I recommend a try before you buy approach. I strongly urge you to buy this set if you like the contents, since a purchase of the set is a vote for more One Piece!

EDIT: I paid $37 for this set and reviewed it with that price in mind, but a week after that the price went down to $22, which is a very good price for what you get. As long as the price stays down, don't pass this set up!",1212019200,6,7153,4.400757575757575
3121856,5,B00143XE64,"If you have even the slightest notion to buy this box set, do it, it is amazing.

sure the special features are lacking, sure its only 13 episodes, but you can not change the fact that it is finally an american release of the greatest anime of all time.

buy this volume, and all the rest to follow, you owe it to yourself.

p.s. it clearly says season 1, first voyage.
MEANING, there will be a season one, second voyage.

funimation is not using false advertising, some people are just not too clever...",1211932800,2,504,4.387096774193548
3121857,3,B00143XE64,"Funimation does a great job with translation on this box set, keeping it uncut in both video and audio. English voices are excellent (coming from a guy who is also watching the sub of the current episodes). The only gripe I have with this box set is the amount of episodes. They should have had at least double what they included (26 vs. 13).",1211932800,4,342,4.359375
3121858,4,B00143XE64,"I pre-ordered this box set from a different source and got it a couple weeks ago. I've watched the first few episodes, and of course am enjoying re-watching what I first saw fansubbed, only this time I get the pleasure of getting to see it on my TV instead of my computer monitor and of course owning it on DVD is great. I really like this anime a good deal, and to have it on DVD, uncut is a dream come true.

However, it isn't a perfect release. Toei Animation has a reputation for ripping some things off of their shows when they find their way to America. The good news: the eps indeed are uncut. We also get the episode previews (which is a treat to me since the fansubs I watched cut them out), the opening and ending themes, and eye catches. On a side note, but worth a mentioned, FUNi even writes ""Zoro"" in the subs, not the incorrect ""Zolo"". The bad news applies mainly to purist fans like myself. The opening, for whatever crazy reason, is textless. I loved the Japanese text when I watched the fansubs. Now there are no credits at all. The logo has been somewhat altered, so that instead of the katakana above the logo, we have the eyesore of the ""Shonen Jump"" title in its place.

The one other thing would be that while the ending has credits, they are entirely English. The original Japanese credits again are missing. I even checked to see if there was an alternate angle, but there wasn't. This is unlike FUNi. Normally I can always count on them to please both the purist sub fans and the American-style desiring dub fans but giving alternate angles, but their One Piece release completely falters in this area, which is disappointing. I can only assume that Toei is to blame for again stealing material from us.

In conclusion, however, the good certainly out-does the bad. We have the show in good quality, and more importantly entirely uncut, and we have the original Japanese language track as well as a new and improved English dub. Special features are pretty lousy, but that could be expected.

I definitely recommend this series. We're blessed to finally have it uncut, and this is a classic that you don't want to miss, and that people of various ages and preferences can enjoy. If you like anime or even a good story with excellent and lovable characters, get this box set. GO ONE PIECE!!",1211414400,21,2315,4.504761904761905
3121859,3,B00143XE64,"From what i understand this only consists of the first 13 episodes. The first season of one piece is the first 50 episodes, currently there are over 350 episodes so this indicates funimation is making a terrible mistake in planning DVD releases.",1211241600,4,245,4.857142857142857
3121860,5,B00143XE64,"At long last, One Piece is being released as it was made to be. Ever since July, 2004, America has been plagued with the irritating English release by 4kids Entertainment. Now, Funimation has picked up the license and is releasing uncut, unedited episodes with an all new English cast and optional Japanese language and English subtitles.

This set features the first 13 episodes of the long running pirate epic, One Piece. A young boy, Luffy, sets out to sea with prospects of gathering a strong crew of mates, becoming the strongest pirate in the world, and finding the legendary treasure, the One Piece. Along the way, he'll meet several villains with evils ranging from power and status, greed, and basic malcontent with the rest of the world. This melodramatic, heroes-against-villains premise pushed the series into the spotlight with believable human drama and bloody duels. While these first few episodes may seem to be a bit slow in some places and the animation doesn't look as shiny and bright as other series, it should be remembered that these episodes were made in 1999. However, the main point of this release is that the One Piece series is getting the treatment it deserves, following Funimation's successful release of the eighth movie.

The new English cast is exceptional, in my opinion. Most of the new actors do a fine job portraying the the enduring characters. The script is accurate to the original, and the new gags are decent. I particularly enjoy Chris Sabat as Roronoa Zoro. Mike McFarland as Buggy the Clown leaves a little to be desired, but otherwise the dub is enjoyable. Changes include an English dub of the opening and closing songs (both of which are not quite as good as the original, but very close), and the removal of text from the opening, plus changing the original One Piece logo to the Funimation version. The original Japanese cast is slightly superior, but it is harder to notice in the earlier episodes, as the actors are still getting used to the characters, especially Kazuya Nakai(Zoro) and Kappei Yamaguchi(Usopp) who overacts the ""determined scenes"" too much in the beginning.

Do pick up this set as there will be many more to follow. The series is filled with charming, memorable characters, ranging from the simple-minded, but determined protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, to the sneaky, infatuating theif Nami. The series contains several hilarious situations that show the world what screwball slapstick can accomplish, and awe-inspiring character drama that will remind why people learn to trust and love one another.

The art style is unique and varied, as the crew meets hordes of intelligently designed individuals. The characters go into exaggerated face faults when annoyed, shocked, or greatly amused, and the undying charm of camaraderie keeps you hooked on this great series.

Along with the 13 uncut episodes, the first episode has an English commentary track on the first episode(featuring Coleen Clinkenbeard[Luffy], Chris Sabat[Zoro], and Mike McFarland[Buggy, Line Producer]), textless opening and closing animation, the DBZ-inspired Marathon Mode that allows one to play all episodes in order while removing the additional opening and closing songs and teasers, and the typical page full of Funimation trailers, including the trailer for the next volume of One Piece.

Currently, the price of this set is just over $20. This is a fantastic deal. Do not miss out.",1208217600,4,3429,5.114285714285714
3121861,5,B00143XE64,One Piece is a great series and this uncut version will impress you more than the terrible botched job that 4kids released awhile back. One Piece is epic and full of heart. The characters are funny and their motivations for their journey will keep you watching. You'll cheer when they win and you'll hate the baddies that try to stop them. It's a cast filled with great characters and exciting stories. This uncut version is a must-have!,1207612800,25,437,4.688311688311688
3121862,5,B00143XE64,"Can't wait to buy this! :) thank u funimation!

Some things i'd like to point out about One Piece:

1. Its really good!  veeeeeeeeerrrrryy good :D  funny, original, deep meaningful storylines, very cool and likable characters.... thats a brief description but i could honestly write pages on how good it is :)

2. It starts off just ok... but it gets better and better as it goes along... just like a snowball rolling down a mountain that eventually becomes an avalanche!  i'm not kidding!  i wasn't that into it at the start.. just watching it cos i heard it was good.. finally around episode 40ish (nami's story) i thought.. hey this is quite good!  then the aribasta arc (around episode 90-125ish).. i was like wow!  and it just gets better and better! and i'm not just saying that.. it really does! :)

3. Dont worry about watching the One Piece movies.  they aren't written by Eiichiro Oda (the super cool guy that writes/draws One Piece manga), they're basically almost like filler episodes that don't really progress the main story.  you can watch them once you've seen the anime episodes and don't have anything to do.. but don't watch them first! it might put you off and make you think One Piece is not great.  I love One Piece.. and i don't even really watch the movies.  I saw some reviews on amazon for the One Piece movie Desert Princess (forgot the exact title).. and some first time viewers got really put off by it.. which is a huge shame.  the reason that movie is bad is they tried to condense 30+ anime episodes into a movie length feature... you lose so much emotional impact that way.  just ignore the movies and maybe watch them after you've seen the series.  you don't even really need to watch the movies.

4. if you are put off by the unusual way that its drawn.. don't worry.. you'll get so used to it.. and soon you couldn't imagine it drawn any other way! :)

5. Dont be put off by the length of the series.  Trust me, once you're into it.. you'll wish that there was more episodes! :)

Well i hope this has helped you decide to give One Piece a try.. post a comment if u started watching the series and liked it!  I hope you don't decide to quit your job in a few months and become a pirate! yohoho! hehe (i know i want to! :P)",1207440000,51,2257,4.375

Anyone who cares to read will see that both the comic and anime are for teens though the story is generally light hearted. I can't recommend this piece of art enough to fans of action adventure stories in the vein of Dragon Ball. Much inspiration for One Piece is credited to Akira Toriyama by Eiichiro Oda himself.

3121874,4,B00143XE64,"OK, I know this review is coming years later compared to when it was released (and I don't normally write reviews) yet I felt that this one needed to be written.

I have been watching this series for many years now and I have to say up front that One Piece is in my opinion the best anime I have seen out there yet. It is my favorite! I'm not going to bore you with talking about/giving a description of the series itself. It starts slow but soon speeds up and becomes greater and more exciting as time goes on. That being said I will move on to my points about the box set(s).

I first started watching One Piece with the 4Kids version and thought it was awesome... until I saw it in Japanese (Eng Subs) and realized that 4Kids completely butchered and mutilated it. So sad... Anyway, having fallen in love with the Japanese version I was doubly frustrated when the 4Kids DVDs did not even contain the original version as an option (despite how they were advertised.) Needless to say I was extremely happy to hear that Funimation was redoing them.

Having finally been able to pick up a few of these box sets (money's been tight and anime is expensive), I am extremely happy to say that it is truly uncut and they DO contain both English and Japanese language options. For that alone I was willing and completely happy to buy them.

There were other nice perks that came with these box sets that I did not expect. One of them was the marathon feature option. Instead of having to listen to the opening/credits on EVERY episode when viewing them in a row I love the fact that I can choose to watch all the episodes on the disc in a row without having to fast-forward or skip over the opening and credits... Yet if I do want to see the openings/credits during each episode I can simply play it as is. I wish all tv shows/series would have this option on their dvds. The more options about how I can view the show, the happier I am.

My one main problem with Funimation's version is the English voices. I have seen many other animes and been completely content with the English voices but for One Piece, in my opinion, most of the voices are not the best fit for the characters. Some are better than others but all of the voices often do not portray the character's emotions very well. All the same I AM glad that they (Funimation) did not distort the story by changing what the characters say (like 4Kids did). Because of my opinion about the dubbing I did not give it five stars but these box sets are still completely worth getting. Funimation treated my favorite anime with respect and gave several options on how we would like to view it. All in all I am very happy. Thank you Funimation for saving my favorite anime for the American/all others who buy this version of anime audience!",1299110400,5,2787,4.382978723404255

3121882,5,B00143XE64,"The action flows very smoothly and very quickly in this series, there are very few dull moments. What really makes this series work is that you care about the characters. Each of the key character has a full story behind them. You learn about their backgrounds, what motivates them, why they are the way they are.  This is what separates a good series from a truly great one. You cheer them when they are victorious, you worry when they get hurt.

Here are some of the key characters in the series.

 The main character, Luffy, is so carefree and happy it's funny. He lives for the moment.  When he's hungry he looks for food and eats as much as he can.  When he's tired he drops where he is and starts sleeping. He tries to befriend everyone and he continuously finds it hard to believe that anyone could be mad at him. He is unswervingly honest.  In fact his directness and honesty gets him into quite a bit of trouble since he speaks his mind freely without a second thought as to how other people might take what he's saying. There are only two things that ever seem to genuinely disturb him.  When anyone mocks his straw hat or tries to damage it, and when anyone hurts his friends. When that happens, you'd better run for cover. When he was a young child he accidentally consumed a strange fruit called the Devil Fruit that came from the mysterious Grand Line, as a result Luffy can stretch his body in a hundred different ways and knows how to use this strange power to very effectively deliver a beating to his enemies. The offset is, consuming the fruit has robbed him of his ability to swim or even to float when in the water, and this gets him into serious trouble many times. Luffy wants to be King of the Pirates, and while he's certainly got the free-wheeling spirit necessary, he doesn't really have the heart to be vicious cruel and brutal like a real pirate would be. His goal is to sail to the Grand Line and find the One Piece, the secret treasure of the former Pirate King known as Gold Roger.

Roronoa Zoro ( Mostly called Zoro in the series ) is the first recruit Luffy gets as he starts to form his Pirate crew.  Zoro is known as  ""The Pirate Hunter"" and is a master swordsman.  He carries three swords and knows how to use them all at the same time very effectively.  His goal is to become the world's greatest swordsman, an oath he swore to accomplish, in memory of a young girl who was also a sword master. They had constantly challenged each other to sword contests as children and she had always won. Zoro was determined to keep training until he could beat her, and though they were bitter rivals they had a respectful friendship. Tragically she dies while Zoro is still very young and still training, and Zoro now carries her sword in her memory and uses it as one of his three swords whenever he fights.

Usopp, who calls himself ""Captian Usopp"" , is Luffy's next recruit.  A young man with long hair and an unusually long nose who is very good with his slingshot, which he uses with his own home made pellets filled with different substances to create different effects. He has a reputation as a prodigious liar, and he does lie frequently, but not very well. He's rather cowardly, and often runs from serious enemies.  As such he's very good at running, and very good at sneak attacks. Though he has a cowardly streak in him, he usually overcomes it when his friends are in trouble and will stand up to villians when the others really need him. Basically a good hearted guy, Usopp keeps the crew amused with his wild stories and his silly antics.

Sanji is next on board Luffy's crew. Sanji is an execllent chef and a very sharp dresser. Slender and blonde, always looking suave and well groomed, he typically has a small cigarette dangling from his lips.  Aside from being a great chef he has incredibly powerful legs and can kick down walls and through steel doors. He was trained by a powerful former pirate captian named Zeff who saved Sanji's life when Sanji was just a young boy. Zeff, known as red-foot because of all the men he kicked to death, is likely from whom Sanji learned his kick tecnhiques. Sanji is seeking the ""All Blue"", a legendary place where the four oceans of the world meet and fish from all the oceans are available at one spot for catching. A chef's dream place. Sanji is in love with Nami, but Nami doesn't feel the same about Sanji and constantly fights off his romantic advances.

Nami is the next recruit. She is a master navigator and map maker. Her skills are unrivaled at steering on the sea. She was a captive slave of the vicious pirates known as the Arlong Pirates, half-fish and half-men, they took over her village when she was young and the fish-man pirate leader, Arlong, made a bargain with her that he would set her and her village free if she could gather one hundred million berries. ( berries... the form of currency in the world of One Piece ). Meanwhile they held her captive at their compound , forcing her to use her skills at map making to set up their own exploitation of the seaboard. It took eight years but Nami finally had colleted almost all of the ransom, by stealing treasure from other pirates.  But Arlong cheated her, and in a deal with a corrupt marine commander had her secret stash of treasure confiscated. Leaving her with no way to pay the ransom. Luffy , learning of her struggle, invaded Arlong's compound and fought him on behalf of Nami, and Nami agreed to join his crew after that.

There is a lot humor , some touching sentimental moments, and some VERY weird battles and insane characters they encounter along the way. It's really the intense characters and bizarre battles that make this series stand out.  I can't think of anything else that compares to it. Once you start watching, you will definitely be hooked on it. The DVD's worked perfectly, great video and audio.  Also, a great feature included on the DVD's in this series is the option for ""Marathon"" Play. That allows you to watch all the episodes on the disk, in a row, without having to watch the opening and closing song segment and credits every time. While there are some violent fights and some drinking/smoking that goes on, I'd rate it a PG level.

It arrived a few week early which was a nice surprise
It's uncut, putting the blood, alcohol and death and anything considered too mature for kids back in.  This means it has more epic phrase and dialogue.
I really recommend this as it's a great start to an a really amazing series
I've seen alot of these episodes before but trust me it's so much better having it on dvd to watch on your tv any time you want whilst on your sofa or bed ^-^  so much so that I've ordered the next five as a result :), so what are you waiting for?",1260144000,,808,3.8323353293413174
3121884,5,B00143XE64,"Currently, there are three mega-popular anime titles: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. They run for over hundreds of episodes, which can be murder on the wallet if you want to buy all three. But, if you can choose to only follow one long running anime series, when it comes to the story One Piece has the strongest, most entertaining arc of all three.

One Piece is about pirates. But, they don't hunt for treasure in the traditional sense, instead it showcases how the bonds of friendship, family, and memories might be the greatest treasures of all.

This two disk set contains the first 13 episodes of this great anime series. Like the other two popular series, One Piece starts relatively simple before picking up stride. Two noteworthy antagonists are found in this volume: Captain Axe-Hand Morgan and Captain Buggy the Clown. As well as introducing three of the main characters: Luffy, Zorro, and Nami. Coming to you uncut and uncensored from Funimation, with dual audio: English, or Japanese with English Subtitles. This isn't that crappy version you might have spotted on Saturday mornings from 4Kids.

And now, through the magic of the internet, you can preview One Piece from Funimation's official webpage: [...]

Simply click, ""Watch Videos Now"" near the bottom left hand of the page, and navigate to which episodes you want to see. Sorry, but it only works in the U.S. and Canada. Try watching the first few episodes, or watch the entire first season online.",1259884800,,1468,4.907258064516129

3121886,5,B00143XE64,"That for some reason i never really got into One Piece.  Maybe it was because of it being censored or something.  But either way, i recently bought the First Voyage of One Piece and it makes a huge difference.  I love the series now and plan on getting the rest of them in the near future.  The characters are crazy funny with their own quirks and ambitions that they are trying to achieve.  Be it the Head Pirate over all others, being the best swordsman in all the land or the best thief ever.  All the characters have something that brings them together good or bad.  I love the battles between the different characters.  But i also love when they go back and tell how the characters got to where they are now.

It's a great opening to the series and if it's any indication.  I will watching One Piece for quite awhile.  This is the version to get not the 4Kids disaster.  It's not even close at all.",1248652800,,903,4.27810650887574

If you like pirate themed stories, or movies like POTC, you will love this. Unfortunatly this series has 13 episodes. Once you start watching, you will get hooked onto this show.

Here is a minor description on the episodes (Spoiler Alert):

Ep 1 : Introduction of Luffy, the main character
Ep 2-3 : Captain Morgan Arc
Ep 4: Luffy's past
Ep 5-8: Buggy The Clown Arc
Ep 9-13: Captain Kuro Arc - continues in the Second Voyage as well",1247097600,,566,4.380952380952381
3121888,5,B00143XE64,"One Piece is the best of anime right now. It's a long running anime and is approaching four hundred episodes at this point. Full of imaginative characters and creative story plots, One Piece is an addictive show that only gets better as it goes along.
I had the misfortune of seeing the first American release of One Piece and it nearly made me dismiss it as cartoony garbage. But my brother discovered it uncut so I ended up watching One Piece the way it was meant to be seen and there was no going back.
The first release doesn't even scratch the surface of how good this show is, but it's a fantastic start and it introduces four of the main characters. Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Usopp. All the episodes are really great but I'm partial to the last arc on this set which is continued into the next set. It features the introduction of Usopp and is definitely the most intense arc of this set.
Funimation's release of One Piece leaves nothing to be desired. An excellent dub for those who don't mind watching it in English. And as for extras there's a pretty great commentary.
All in all there's really nothing around like One Piece and it's about time it got the release it deserved in this country.",1239235200,,1198,4.45
3121889,5,B00143XE64,"If anyone remembers, 4Kids ruined the first American TV run of ""One Piece"" with a god-awful opening song rap and other terrible dubs.

However, for the most part, Funimation does a great job with all the dubs and the special features in ""First Voyage (Uncut).""

This is ""One Piece"" as it was meant to be seen. Characters gets scarred up by swords and other weapons, but Luffy and his friends manage to take out plenty of evil pirates, while helping other people along the way.

Luffy wants to travel on the Grand Line to find treasure, to become the world's greatest pirate and to return his straw hat to his idol, Captain Shanks. Luffy's friends also want to travel for their own reasons. Roronoa Zoro wants to become the world's greatest swordsman, for his friend Kuina. Nami is a pirate pickpocket who doesn't want to join Luffy, but she still admires Luffy's courage and passion for his friends.

Overall, ""One Piece"" follows the typical shonen format, in which superpowered characters beat up villains with special powers. However, ""One Piece"" has tons of charming characters. Luffy always reveals his presence at the most inconvenient times, saying whatever he feels like saying. Zoro is a cool-headed swordsman, wielding swords in both hands and a sword in his mouth. And Nami is much tougher and more cunning than Kaoru (from Rurouni Kenshin) could ever be.

There are a couple quips. Funimation dubbed English voices to sing the original TV theme, which sounds somewhat better than the 4Kids rap, but still awful. And some of the dubs are mediocre. For example, one of the marines in episode one threw a grappling hook and missed a barrel in the ocean. Then his buddy says, ""HA!HA!HA! You suck!"" Overall, though, the voice actors do a good job. Luffy's voice actor is especially great at capturing the Gum-gum punch voice.

So, don't be afraid of some of the slightly mediocre dubs or the somewhat unconventional character designs. This is an excellent shonen anime that never stops losing momentum. The fights are intense and the characters are unforgettable. And although ""First Voyage"" ends in the middle of the epic battle between Captain Kuro and Django, it's a great introduction to an awesome series.",1235952000,,2216,4.896

This DVD the first 2 story arcs of One Piece, plus half of the Captain Kuro arc. It's enough to quench your thirst for the lovely series i think.

3121902,5,B00143XE64,"I've been a faithful reader of One Piece since August of 2003, in fact it was the first manga I ever read, and I fell in love with it from the start. Naturally, I was overjoyed when I heard it would be coming to the US in anime format on the Fall of 2004 on the formally known Fox Box. Of course what I say was a terrible regurgitated American washed TV cartoon for children of 5 and younger. I was rather upset at how badly people, such as the FCC, ruined my favorite manga. After 2 years of disappointment, 4kids TV cancelled the already heavily edited show. Since I don't have cable, that was the last I'd see of it... Until today. This new unedited, uncut version of the manga I so dearly love is far superior to it's terrible American counterpart, if it can even be called that. All the cursing, alcohol, actual violence, and blood remain perfectly in tact, not to mention the outstanding improvement in dialogue. Any one who has read the manga or seen the show should definitely purchase this. Thank you Funimation, you've saved my favorite anime.",1222300800,,1053,4.461139896373057

Secondly, I'd like to agree with the previous post about how many box sets will be required to complete the set! 30+ is too many!!

Finally however, and this is the scary part, how long will this take if Funimation stick by there statement of releasing 2/3 sets per year!!! I can tell you now that in 10 years time DVD will be pretty much redundant, and I wouldn't be surprised if Funimation decide to drop it before then in favor of re releasing it on blu-ray with more episodes.

So, although I do recommend this set to new comers, if your after the complete series I'd hold out to see what Funi decide to do, we all know what happened with DBZ ;)",1221609600,3,807,4.193548387096774
3121904,5,B00143XE64,"Totally awesome show. I don't own the dvd and will explain why shortly. However I have seen every episode aired so far in japan via fansubs online. This show starts out good and stays good throughout.

Now is the problem part. This show is almost 400 episodes long so far in japan and shows no signs of slowing down at all. Then Funimation releases this set. I am very happy as many people are that they made these dvds uncut finally, unlike the 4kids version garbage. However this box holds 13 episodes....anyone want to do the math on how many boxes will be required to hold just the current ~400 episodes? Its 30 boxes. for the first 400 episodes, plus at least 100 more episodes probably or more.

What I ask for and want, is much larger box sets, use a slim form factor of some kind or other and release box sets with like 50 episodes if possible. Then I would have to buy far fewer boxes and it would take up less shelf space. I know this is mostly just semantics and personal preference, but I'm not the only one who feels this way and for a show this insanely long, more expansive box sets are necessary. Asking for this concession seems more than reasonable to me, if not an outright obvious thing to do.

Lastly, How many shows do you know that run 400 episodes plus and stay good the whole time? I know of no other. So if you don't mind the size of this box or have no intention of buying more than the first few seasons, then this box is very worth your while. So go and buy it already. Those of us who plan to buy all 560 episodes of the show or however many it ends up being....all we can do is pray they will wise up and give bigger boxes. Good luck to everyone?

Here comes the silly part.
Luffy ate a 'yum yum fruit' or (Devil Fruit). Makes his body rubber. The drawback is he can't swim, and drowns in water.

3121907,5,B00143XE64,"First, I would also like to join in with most of the other reviewers in thanking FUNimation for their handling of this show. I used to hate you guys just as much if not more than 4kids, if you were around in the 1990's you'll probably understand why, but after watching your conduct after you licensed the series and up to it's CN debut I've had a complete change of heart. You guys really fought for us fans, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for you all now. (Hopefully CN will come to their senses and pick up the series again, but if not you can always fall back on the knowledge that most self-respecting One Piece fans are more than willing to buy your releases. (Heck, I bought Movie 8 along with this despite knowing it was utter crap just to help fund your future efforts.)

Anyways, there really isn't much left to say about how awesome this box set is.. Because as it stands most of the other reviewers have already covered everything I was going to say.
However, I can still say that the FUNimation dubbed track for this series is one of the best I have ever come across, almost as good as FMA's dub, and you really should give it chance even if you're a subtitles purist. You can really tell that the actors love their roles and are trying their hardest to do right by the series. I honestly like their portrayals just as much as the performances given from their Japanese counterparts, and given how long I've been watching the series in Japanese that's saying a lot.

One nitpick though: More extras next time please... D:",1215820800,5,1545,4.417543859649123

It's great, of course, to watch the show in it's original Japanese and it looks clean and sounds great too.  The dubbing is impressive too, with much care being taken into all of the characters and the way they would speak in English.  It was quite clear to me that the voice acting was being directed by someone who loves OP as much as I do.  For the first time in a very long time, I can say I watched the whole of the entire 2 DVD sets' English dubbing.

3121910,4,B00143XE64,"One Piece has been around for almost 10 years in Japan now, and after all that time we finally get a dub for this great series that's done right. After 4kids butchered the series I had lost all hope of One Piece ever reaching an American audience in the way it was supposed to. With Funimation controling the dub now things are much better. This is uncut as advertised, nothing has been changed or edited, and features both the new and improved Funimation dub with a new voice cast, and the original japanese audio as well. The quality on the japanese audio is a bit lower than the american audio, but that might be because the original japanese audio for these first episodes was recorded back in 1999. The video quality is excellent however and I have no complaints in that aspect. The extras aren't too bad either with some company trailers, episode commentaries, and the same marathon feature found on their Dragon Ball Z boxsets. The marathon feature just streams all the episodes together without an opening or closing theme.
That's not to say that this boxset doesn't have it's problems. To be honest I really can't stand Luffy's american voice. I know it's a woman doing the voice work and it's definitely hard to hit some of Luffy's notes, so it's not her fault entirely. It's still better than the 4kids Luffy though, in fact, all of the voices are better. But the first time I heard Luffy yell ""I SLEPT SO GREAT!"" I cringed. The voice does get better by the end of the boxset as she is settling in to her role though. The amazon price is excellent and definitely worth the price but the regular listed price goes for $50. $50 for 13 episodes is a lot of money, which brings me to the biggest problem. The series began running in Japan in 1999 and is still going today. As of July 6th, 2008, there are 361 episodes to this series, and a new episode airs just about eveyr week. That brings me to my biggest point. This series probably won't be coming back to TV, and if it did it would be edited again, so to continue to buy each boxset and watch every episode is a major time and money investment. As with all series of this nature, until the main cast of characters fills out the series starts off slow and gets better, but this show is definitely a commitment. If you fall in love with the show from the start then you might think that's worth it, but just be warned of that.
Overall though I think this series is fantastic and Funimation has done a great job of saving this series. For $20 you really should just give it a try.",1215388800,3,2540,4.3949044585987265

The video quality is great, the sound is perfect and I'm watching my favorite anime on the big screen... how can I go wrong? After 4Kidz, I was sceptical of the english dub, but was pleasantly surprised after watching an episode in english. The characters' voices are well made and the script is great as should be expected, and lets not forget the incredibly well made intro-song!! If you're like me and prefers the original voices, they're all in there. The subtitles are dull and boring compared to the hardsubs offered from fansub-groups, but they work well enough and that's all I can wish for.

The set ends halfway through the ""Kuro"" arc, as the gang fight to protect a village from being pillaged by pirates. To be continued in volume 2.

As mentioned, this is not the horrid 4Kids dub, nor is it a merely serviceable dub like so many other anime shows are saddled with. There's care in the script and the acting, making the English adaptation just as valid and enjoyable as the original Japanese. The original music is intact as well, and even the openings and endings have faithful English counterparts. There's strong production value all around.

About the only thing that keeps this set from being truly ""uncut and unedited"" as billed would have been the inclusion of the original One Piece logo on an alternate angle (Funi uses their gold variation, which removes the Luffy caricature for an actual ""I"").

3121916,5,B00143XE64,"Oh wow! Here it is at long last! One Piece in the states!!
First off, THANK YOU FUNI!!!!!! You saved One Piece!
I'll talk about the plot of the show a little as I'm sure some people who were never into it before will be lured by the low price and the high value.

Monkey D. Luffy is a quarkey fellow who wants nothing more to rule the seas as King of the Pirates. To do this, he must gather some powerful allies and traverse a dangerous sea that is known as the Grand Line. At the end of the Grand Line supposedly awaits the legendary treasure of the former Pirate King. This treasure is simply known as ""One Piece"" and it is said to bring its owner all the wealth, fame, and power the world has to offer, in turn making them the ""King of the Pirates!""

Luffy is helped a long by a special ability he was granted by eating a legendary ""devil fruit"" and that is that his entire body is made of rubber. This is basically grants him extra velocity and force and makes him capable of easily beating most enemies into a bloody pulp. In this volume in particular you will also be introduced to his first 3 comrades.
Zoro - former bounty hunter turned Pirate. He aspires to be the world's greatest swordsman.
Nami - specializes in thievery... wants nothing more than to be filthy rich.
Usopp - a liar and an idiot, but also a genius who is able to think his way around most fights. He invents many gadgets and weapons for his allies to use in battle... also the crew's sharp shooter.
Together these endearing and unforgettable characters come together to bring you one of the greatest and most epic animes of all time!

Now I'll talk about the box... its pretty damn good. Only purists will find faults with it. It's basically a couple of thin paks that hold 6-7 episodes each. It is a little lacking on the special features front, it has a marathon mode that I have yet to try out so I can't tell you much about it and a commentary on the first episode by Mike McFarland(line producer), Colleen Clinkenbeard(Luffy VA), and Chris Sabat(Zoro VA). I found the commentary somewhat interesting as they did talk quite a bit about how crazy it is to create basically 2 different dubs, an editted one for cartoon network that is on episode 170 and an uncut one for DVD that is at episode 1. The only thing that I think you can consider problematic is if you want to watch the english dub you have to listen to Vic Mignogna(i think its him) sing a dubbed intro as well, and while its not terrible and its an impressively close translation, I'm just a sucker for the original japanese openings. Also the ending is dubbed as well... oh well.

This brings me to the dub. It's not bad. I told myself when I got this, the first time I watched it, it would be the dub and now that I've given it a chance it has started to grow on me. When I first heard Luffy's new voice on TV I hated it, but once I sat down and spent some good quality time with the english speaking Luffy I found his voice to be very appropriate and convincing, if not a little raspier than his japanese counterpart. It's just a little hard to get used to any kind of new voice when you've seen 350+ episodes of Japanese Luffy. The rest of the cast is very good and the script is very accurate(yes there is quite a bit of profanity).

In closing I would like to say one more thing. If you originally watched One Piece via fansubs or god forbid you got some bootleg DVDs, it is your duty to buy this. Give funi their proper due and pick it up please.
And anyone else, if you are looking for an epic anime that brings you tons of humor, drama, and some of the most epic(i like this word) battles ever seen in anime, pick this up. I promise you will not be disappointed.

5/5 stars. Buy, don't rent. You want to own this, and you can't beat amazons price. 20 dollars for 13 episodes of anime just doesn't happen that often.",1212883200,3,3868,4.25578231292517

okay how will i start this review ? i watched one piece oh that was years and years ago it was aired on the UK  on toonanime when  i was at secondary school say 6th year it was the 4kids entertaiment edited version at that time i never heard of anime before and i didn't know what it was. at  that time the  Tv show that i became a fan of was Dragonballz and that was new to the UK along with one piece i remeber watching a few episode then i think i stop watching it then when i went to collage they stop showing along with Dragonballz due to mild violence.

I was going buy the one piece dvd's  viz meda but 4kids enteraiment cut all the violnece like blood and swearing.  i read some of the reviews saying not to buy because its edited and not to  waste your money so i kinda held back and waited to see if a new version of one piece would come out. Well now it has Funimation as uncut and unedited it, and its about time why did they take so long?.

i really ejoyed watching the 13 episodes it was worth the wait thanks Funimation looking forward to the rest of one piece series.

3121918,4,B00143XE64,"...that Funimation is respecting this wildly popular show enough to give us One Piece in all it's uncut and unedited glory. Yeah, I really wish there were special features, and I hope and pray with all my might that future releases will contain more episdoes, since - as many have mentioned - One Piece is still going strong at 500+ chapters in the manga and 300+ episodes of the anime.

And it is all oh so good. I am consistently amazed by this show. Sure, it's goofy and adventurous. But it can also be utterly heartbreaking, gut-bustlingly hilarious, and violent enough at points to be wince-worthy. Not that any one of those things is merit enough by itself. It's just that One Piece is all of those things at once and it's so darn seamless. Really. I cannot praise this show highly enough.

That being said, since this is a review of a DVD set and not the entire show, I was unsure about buying this set because it only has the first thirteen episodes, but I bought it in hopes that my purchase would reflect the desire for One Piece among American consumers. Plus, it's fantastic to watch on a large television screen, instead of a small computer screen.

And if you are worried about the English dubbed voices, let me just tell you that I am in love with the original Japanese voices, but my 10-year-old sister has a hard time reading subtitles, so we watched it with the English dub. It does take an episode or two to get used to the new voices, but Funimation has really done a good job. Characters don't have outrageous and stereotypical accents like in the 4Kids dub, and Zoro is actually called ""Zoro"" instead of ""Zolo""! Hurrah!

It's lovely to go back and relive the early days when all our favorite characters first met, and to viewers who are new to the world of One Piece, I want to put it on the record that when I first read One Piece (I read the manga before I saw the anime) it took me quite a while to get into it. Heck, I didn't even like pirates! But all good things take time, and I kept reading, and soon I was hooked. So give it a chance. And if it turns out it's not your cup of tea, then thanks for looking anyways. But you'll never know what you might be missing if you don't try it, right?",1212624000,13,2220,4.316546762589928
3121919,5,B00143XE64,"This series is great! And im so glad it finally got a proper uncut release. All the original openings and endings have been redubbed, all the characters are redubbed, and the script is completely uncut!

3121920,5,B00143XE64,"It's been FAR too long in coming, but this new subtitled/dubbed version -- uncut and with all the sweat, blood and tears intact -- is absolutely GORGEOUS. Clear, crisp visuals. Clean sound. NO EDITING. WOO HOO!!

One technical complaint is that the individual episode links don't seem to work on Disk 2. No matter which episode I select, it always starts on the first one on the disk. Annoying, but not deal-breaking. Marathon mode (where you can watch all the episodes on a disk in a row with titles and re-cap cut out) MORE than makes up for this minor production flaw. I just hope they get that sorted out on the next set.

I'm a purist, I admit it. Personally, I listen only to the Japanese track. I know a dub is essential for marketing in the US, but honestly, one is missing SO MUCH of the One Piece experience if one only listens to the dub.

Part and parcel of the One Piece package is the INCREDIBLE voice acting on the part of the Japanese seiyuu; only they seem able to bring these amazing, inspiring, crazy characters to full life. Just watching Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Bazooka or Zoro's Oni Giri in motion doesn't quite do it... you need to *hear* them. Especially the always wacky and delightful Kappei Yamaguchi (more commonly known for his role as Inuyasha) as Usopp the Liar and the series-favorite Kazuki Yao who creates distinctive voices for many of the more, um, *unique* villains along the way (until he finally joins the crew much later!).

I'd really like to see the Japanese versions of the title/ending songs as extras next time too, in addition to the English re-works (which actually are pretty decent). You did *so* much better then 4Kids with this one, Funimation, that it's no real comparison. I like to pretend that horror doesn't even exist, actually. (Now if we could just get Viz to show the manga more respect too.... *heavy sigh*)

THANK YOU for saving One Piece, Funimation. It more than deserves the chance to be as big over here as it still is in Japan after 10 years!

Keep up the good work and... when does the next set come out? I want to buy it right now! *happy grin*",1212105600,14,2110,4.510471204188482
3356352,4,B00143XE64,"The Story

One Piece is a story set in a time called the Great Pirate Era focused on one ragtag group of pirates. In this DVD set you'll meet: Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the crew and user of the Gum Gum fruit; Roronoa Zoro, master swordsman and former bounty hunter; Nami, skilled thief who preys on pirates, and; Usopp, an infamous liar and wannabe pirate. Although by the end of this set they won't be officially a crew, the observant will notice their visages on the box art, so you know it's coming.

The entire first season tells the story of how Luffy brought his crew together before they headed to the Grand Line. We'll also get to see the back-stories for all of the characters, which is a real treat indeed, but we'll only get to see that for two of them in this set. We actually don't get to see all the members of Luffy's crew in this set, we'll need to wait until the next one for that.

When I started watching One Piece using fansubs, I was turned off by the romantic hero-pirate gag. ""Pirates don't act like that, how dumb,"" I said to myself. The very premise of the show, Luffy's wholehearted desire to get the mystical 'One Piece', didn't fit with the character initially. Luffy is a self-serving pirate aiming for riches and glory, but then he does many self-less things, so how can he really be a pirate?

However, like I did with Naruto (which I also needed to get used to), I gave One Piece a chance to show its muster. Man am I glad I did. After a while I ignored the only passing resemblance to pirates that the crew had and let myself get lost in the story instead.

One Piece's story is dynamic. At times it is hilarious and fun, and then moments later it can be intense and dramatic. The story is top-notch and certainly deserving of the reader's interest. I saw the snowball metaphor used to describe this story and I would have to concur.

The Art

The characters in One Piece are imaginative and well drawn, as are the locations that they go to.  One Piece's animation and artwork are good, but not great. You're not going to be awed by any special effects in this or any future sets. This doesn't detract from the show for myself, but if you're the type that desires excellent art, you may want to look elsewhere. The art here is probably comparable to the art in Naruto or Pokemon, which is something you'd expect from a longer running show.

The Acting

Voice acting is alright. I might be a bit biased in this regard, since I've watched so much of One Piece with Japanese dubs, but I prefer the Japanese dubs to the English ones. Fortunately, you have your choice of both English and Japanese in this set, so there's no need to choose.

I would have to say that the translation is better than those found in fansubs. When Luffy pops out of the barrel in front of a couple of pirates, he says, ""Who the hell are you?"" and they reply, ""Who the hell are YOU?!"", which is far funnier than the fansub translation you'll find on the internet. This is just one example, but you'll find that the acting is pretty decent. Personally, I think their choice to have certain 'rough' characters enunciate their words perfectly to be a little off-putting, but it could be that the Japanese is the same way. I don't know since I don't speak Japanese.

Over all, I'd say that the voice acting is well done, but so far there hasn't been a real chance for the actors to flex their vocal talents (although I'm sure it takes a lot for them to speak in some of the more raspy voices like Luffy's or Buggy's).

One thing parents will want to take note of is that there is a plentiful supply of swearing. If you're looking for a show for your youngin's to watch, you may need to look elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll find the word choices to be tasteful and fulfilling.

The Music

Ah, music, one of the more important aspects of video entertainment. Since One Piece is about pirates, you'd expect 'piratey' music, which you'll find plenty of. When there is an action scene, there is fast-paced music to set the mood. Likewise for dramatic moments.

The music in this part of One Piece doesn't drive the mood as much as it does in later episodes, but it certainly isn't a let down either. Many of the characters will end up having their own theme music played when they are in intense fight scenes, and that is when you'll really notice the quality of it.

The Hardware

This set comes in two attractive slim-cases with an equally attractive cardboard sleeve to keep them together. The episodes included on each disc are listed on the back of the cases, rather than listed on a small slip of paper nestled in some large casing holding multiple discs. This set up is easier and more convenient than the Naruto uncut boxed sets which have the aforementioned large case. I don't have much of a plastic fetish, so the physical media and casing don't matter to me much. It does its job well and doesn't get in my way.

The Set

The set is called One Piece - Season 1, First Voyage. It's important to note the qualifier 'First Voyage', since this set doesn't actually contain the whole first season. If you check IMDB, you'll find out that the first season contained a whopping 47 episodes, which means that it will take four sets like this one to cover the entire first season of One Piece. That's a lot of money to get just the first season of a cartoon that is 360+ episodes strong.

FUNimation could have at least finished out the Usopp storyarc rather than leave us hanging, but this seems to be standard anime studio practice since the Naruto boxed sets also have a comparable amount of episodes per set. It's a stupid, greedy, practice in my opinion. You can get the Heroes or House M.D. first seasons for nearly the same price, but while with this set we get 312 minutes of entertainment, with those sets you get 1035 and 1050 minutes respectively. That's over three times as much content! This is the main reason this set doesn't get five stars from me. One would have to have a very convincing reason other than greed to justify this aspect of this set and other comparable sets.

Conclusion

So now comes the recommendation. To buy, or not to buy? That is the question. My heart yells a resounding ""Yes!"", but my mind says to be cautious with such a purchase. I bought this set largely to support the creation of the show itself, since I have already watched the entire series through fansubs I downloaded. This means that I already knew what I was getting in to and that I was already prepared to be gouged by FUNimation for such a measly amount of content. I wasn't sold on this series until around episode 30, which is approximately two sets away.

I'm an unrepentant downloader of fansubs and an equally zealous purchaser of the anime series I watch. I recommend a try before you buy approach. I strongly urge you to buy this set if you like the contents, since a purchase of the set is a vote for more One Piece!

EDIT: I paid $37 for this set and reviewed it with that price in mind, but a week after that the price went down to $22, which is a very good price for what you get. As long as the price stays down, don't pass this set up!",1212019200,6,7153,4.400757575757575

p.s. it clearly says season 1, first voyage.
MEANING, there will be a season one, second voyage.

3356354,3,B00143XE64,"Funimation does a great job with translation on this box set, keeping it uncut in both video and audio. English voices are excellent (coming from a guy who is also watching the sub of the current episodes). The only gripe I have with this box set is the amount of episodes. They should have had at least double what they included (26 vs. 13).",1211932800,4,342,4.359375
3356355,4,B00143XE64,"I pre-ordered this box set from a different source and got it a couple weeks ago. I've watched the first few episodes, and of course am enjoying re-watching what I first saw fansubbed, only this time I get the pleasure of getting to see it on my TV instead of my computer monitor and of course owning it on DVD is great. I really like this anime a good deal, and to have it on DVD, uncut is a dream come true.

However, it isn't a perfect release. Toei Animation has a reputation for ripping some things off of their shows when they find their way to America. The good news: the eps indeed are uncut. We also get the episode previews (which is a treat to me since the fansubs I watched cut them out), the opening and ending themes, and eye catches. On a side note, but worth a mentioned, FUNi even writes ""Zoro"" in the subs, not the incorrect ""Zolo"". The bad news applies mainly to purist fans like myself. The opening, for whatever crazy reason, is textless. I loved the Japanese text when I watched the fansubs. Now there are no credits at all. The logo has been somewhat altered, so that instead of the katakana above the logo, we have the eyesore of the ""Shonen Jump"" title in its place.

The one other thing would be that while the ending has credits, they are entirely English. The original Japanese credits again are missing. I even checked to see if there was an alternate angle, but there wasn't. This is unlike FUNi. Normally I can always count on them to please both the purist sub fans and the American-style desiring dub fans but giving alternate angles, but their One Piece release completely falters in this area, which is disappointing. I can only assume that Toei is to blame for again stealing material from us.

In conclusion, however, the good certainly out-does the bad. We have the show in good quality, and more importantly entirely uncut, and we have the original Japanese language track as well as a new and improved English dub. Special features are pretty lousy, but that could be expected.

I definitely recommend this series. We're blessed to finally have it uncut, and this is a classic that you don't want to miss, and that people of various ages and preferences can enjoy. If you like anime or even a good story with excellent and lovable characters, get this box set. GO ONE PIECE!!",1211414400,21,2315,4.504761904761905

3356357,5,B00143XE64,"At long last, One Piece is being released as it was made to be. Ever since July, 2004, America has been plagued with the irritating English release by 4kids Entertainment. Now, Funimation has picked up the license and is releasing uncut, unedited episodes with an all new English cast and optional Japanese language and English subtitles.

This set features the first 13 episodes of the long running pirate epic, One Piece. A young boy, Luffy, sets out to sea with prospects of gathering a strong crew of mates, becoming the strongest pirate in the world, and finding the legendary treasure, the One Piece. Along the way, he'll meet several villains with evils ranging from power and status, greed, and basic malcontent with the rest of the world. This melodramatic, heroes-against-villains premise pushed the series into the spotlight with believable human drama and bloody duels. While these first few episodes may seem to be a bit slow in some places and the animation doesn't look as shiny and bright as other series, it should be remembered that these episodes were made in 1999. However, the main point of this release is that the One Piece series is getting the treatment it deserves, following Funimation's successful release of the eighth movie.

The new English cast is exceptional, in my opinion. Most of the new actors do a fine job portraying the the enduring characters. The script is accurate to the original, and the new gags are decent. I particularly enjoy Chris Sabat as Roronoa Zoro. Mike McFarland as Buggy the Clown leaves a little to be desired, but otherwise the dub is enjoyable. Changes include an English dub of the opening and closing songs (both of which are not quite as good as the original, but very close), and the removal of text from the opening, plus changing the original One Piece logo to the Funimation version. The original Japanese cast is slightly superior, but it is harder to notice in the earlier episodes, as the actors are still getting used to the characters, especially Kazuya Nakai(Zoro) and Kappei Yamaguchi(Usopp) who overacts the ""determined scenes"" too much in the beginning.

Do pick up this set as there will be many more to follow. The series is filled with charming, memorable characters, ranging from the simple-minded, but determined protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, to the sneaky, infatuating theif Nami. The series contains several hilarious situations that show the world what screwball slapstick can accomplish, and awe-inspiring character drama that will remind why people learn to trust and love one another.

The art style is unique and varied, as the crew meets hordes of intelligently designed individuals. The characters go into exaggerated face faults when annoyed, shocked, or greatly amused, and the undying charm of camaraderie keeps you hooked on this great series.

Along with the 13 uncut episodes, the first episode has an English commentary track on the first episode(featuring Coleen Clinkenbeard[Luffy], Chris Sabat[Zoro], and Mike McFarland[Buggy, Line Producer]), textless opening and closing animation, the DBZ-inspired Marathon Mode that allows one to play all episodes in order while removing the additional opening and closing songs and teasers, and the typical page full of Funimation trailers, including the trailer for the next volume of One Piece.

Currently, the price of this set is just over $20. This is a fantastic deal. Do not miss out.",1208217600,4,3429,5.114285714285714

Some things i'd like to point out about One Piece:

1. Its really good!  veeeeeeeeerrrrryy good :D  funny, original, deep meaningful storylines, very cool and likable characters.... thats a brief description but i could honestly write pages on how good it is :)

2. It starts off just ok... but it gets better and better as it goes along... just like a snowball rolling down a mountain that eventually becomes an avalanche!  i'm not kidding!  i wasn't that into it at the start.. just watching it cos i heard it was good.. finally around episode 40ish (nami's story) i thought.. hey this is quite good!  then the aribasta arc (around episode 90-125ish).. i was like wow!  and it just gets better and better! and i'm not just saying that.. it really does! :)

3. Dont worry about watching the One Piece movies.  they aren't written by Eiichiro Oda (the super cool guy that writes/draws One Piece manga), they're basically almost like filler episodes that don't really progress the main story.  you can watch them once you've seen the anime episodes and don't have anything to do.. but don't watch them first! it might put you off and make you think One Piece is not great.  I love One Piece.. and i don't even really watch the movies.  I saw some reviews on amazon for the One Piece movie Desert Princess (forgot the exact title).. and some first time viewers got really put off by it.. which is a huge shame.  the reason that movie is bad is they tried to condense 30+ anime episodes into a movie length feature... you lose so much emotional impact that way.  just ignore the movies and maybe watch them after you've seen the series.  you don't even really need to watch the movies.

4. if you are put off by the unusual way that its drawn.. don't worry.. you'll get so used to it.. and soon you couldn't imagine it drawn any other way! :)

5. Dont be put off by the length of the series.  Trust me, once you're into it.. you'll wish that there was more episodes! :)

Well i hope this has helped you decide to give One Piece a try.. post a comment if u started watching the series and liked it!  I hope you don't decide to quit your job in a few months and become a pirate! yohoho! hehe (i know i want to! :P)",1207440000,51,2257,4.375

3356371,4,B00143XE64,"OK, I know this review is coming years later compared to when it was released (and I don't normally write reviews) yet I felt that this one needed to be written.

I have been watching this series for many years now and I have to say up front that One Piece is in my opinion the best anime I have seen out there yet. It is my favorite! I'm not going to bore you with talking about/giving a description of the series itself. It starts slow but soon speeds up and becomes greater and more exciting as time goes on. That being said I will move on to my points about the box set(s).

I first started watching One Piece with the 4Kids version and thought it was awesome... until I saw it in Japanese (Eng Subs) and realized that 4Kids completely butchered and mutilated it. So sad... Anyway, having fallen in love with the Japanese version I was doubly frustrated when the 4Kids DVDs did not even contain the original version as an option (despite how they were advertised.) Needless to say I was extremely happy to hear that Funimation was redoing them.

Having finally been able to pick up a few of these box sets (money's been tight and anime is expensive), I am extremely happy to say that it is truly uncut and they DO contain both English and Japanese language options. For that alone I was willing and completely happy to buy them.

There were other nice perks that came with these box sets that I did not expect. One of them was the marathon feature option. Instead of having to listen to the opening/credits on EVERY episode when viewing them in a row I love the fact that I can choose to watch all the episodes on the disc in a row without having to fast-forward or skip over the opening and credits... Yet if I do want to see the openings/credits during each episode I can simply play it as is. I wish all tv shows/series would have this option on their dvds. The more options about how I can view the show, the happier I am.

My one main problem with Funimation's version is the English voices. I have seen many other animes and been completely content with the English voices but for One Piece, in my opinion, most of the voices are not the best fit for the characters. Some are better than others but all of the voices often do not portray the character's emotions very well. All the same I AM glad that they (Funimation) did not distort the story by changing what the characters say (like 4Kids did). Because of my opinion about the dubbing I did not give it five stars but these box sets are still completely worth getting. Funimation treated my favorite anime with respect and gave several options on how we would like to view it. All in all I am very happy.

I get the best of the best that I feel is worth it. I've seen some on watched it on TV, uploaded feeds, but you know what I'll still bite.  why? because I love it that why and see it at any time because one day its not going to be anymore.

Most importantly keeping it as part of your DvD collection of Favorites: Action:: Spider-man Movies 1-3, Pirate of the Caribbean 1-3, Rush Hour 1-3 etc.. ;  Anime: Ranma1/2, Fruits Basket, Cardcaptor Sakura. etc..
Classics that will never look bad(to you of course), watch it again someday brings fond memories.

my only complain is, finding it in a local retail store, not there
and the price is a real pain, however I'm no sucker, wait a bit before biting.",1279756800,,893,4.235294117647059

3356378,5,B00143XE64,Truly an amazing addition to my collection! Monkey D's innocent and straight forward approach to situations will grow on you quickly. I quickly scooped up all available episodes  after watching the First Voyage! Long live the Straw Hat Pirates!!,1271462400,,245,5.282051282051282
3356379,5,B00143XE64,"The action flows very smoothly and very quickly in this series, there are very few dull moments. What really makes this series work is that you care about the characters. Each of the key character has a full story behind them. You learn about their backgrounds, what motivates them, why they are the way they are.  This is what separates a good series from a truly great one. You cheer them when they are victorious, you worry when they get hurt.

Here are some of the key characters in the series.

 The main character, Luffy, is so carefree and happy it's funny. He lives for the moment.  When he's hungry he looks for food and eats as much as he can.  When he's tired he drops where he is and starts sleeping. He tries to befriend everyone and he continuously finds it hard to believe that anyone could be mad at him. He is unswervingly honest.  In fact his directness and honesty gets him into quite a bit of trouble since he speaks his mind freely without a second thought as to how other people might take what he's saying. There are only two things that ever seem to genuinely disturb him.  When anyone mocks his straw hat or tries to damage it, and when anyone hurts his friends. When that happens, you'd better run for cover. When he was a young child he accidentally consumed a strange fruit called the Devil Fruit that came from the mysterious Grand Line, as a result Luffy can stretch his body in a hundred different ways and knows how to use this strange power to very effectively deliver a beating to his enemies. The offset is, consuming the fruit has robbed him of his ability to swim or even to float when in the water, and this gets him into serious trouble many times. Luffy wants to be King of the Pirates, and while he's certainly got the free-wheeling spirit necessary, he doesn't really have the heart to be vicious cruel and brutal like a real pirate would be. His goal is to sail to the Grand Line and find the One Piece, the secret treasure of the former Pirate King known as Gold Roger.

Roronoa Zoro ( Mostly called Zoro in the series ) is the first recruit Luffy gets as he starts to form his Pirate crew.  Zoro is known as  ""The Pirate Hunter"" and is a master swordsman.  He carries three swords and knows how to use them all at the same time very effectively.  His goal is to become the world's greatest swordsman, an oath he swore to accomplish, in memory of a young girl who was also a sword master. They had constantly challenged each other to sword contests as children and she had always won. Zoro was determined to keep training until he could beat her, and though they were bitter rivals they had a respectful friendship. Tragically she dies while Zoro is still very young and still training, and Zoro now carries her sword in her memory and uses it as one of his three swords whenever he fights.

Usopp, who calls himself ""Captian Usopp"" , is Luffy's next recruit.  A young man with long hair and an unusually long nose who is very good with his slingshot, which he uses with his own home made pellets filled with different substances to create different effects. He has a reputation as a prodigious liar, and he does lie frequently, but not very well. He's rather cowardly, and often runs from serious enemies.  As such he's very good at running, and very good at sneak attacks. Though he has a cowardly streak in him, he usually overcomes it when his friends are in trouble and will stand up to villians when the others really need him. Basically a good hearted guy, Usopp keeps the crew amused with his wild stories and his silly antics.

Sanji is next on board Luffy's crew. Sanji is an execllent chef and a very sharp dresser. Slender and blonde, always looking suave and well groomed, he typically has a small cigarette dangling from his lips.  Aside from being a great chef he has incredibly powerful legs and can kick down walls and through steel doors. He was trained by a powerful former pirate captian named Zeff who saved Sanji's life when Sanji was just a young boy. Zeff, known as red-foot because of all the men he kicked to death, is likely from whom Sanji learned his kick tecnhiques. Sanji is seeking the ""All Blue"", a legendary place where the four oceans of the world meet and fish from all the oceans are available at one spot for catching. A chef's dream place. Sanji is in love with Nami, but Nami doesn't feel the same about Sanji and constantly fights off his romantic advances.

Nami is the next recruit. She is a master navigator and map maker. Her skills are unrivaled at steering on the sea. She was a captive slave of the vicious pirates known as the Arlong Pirates, half-fish and half-men, they took over her village when she was young and the fish-man pirate leader, Arlong, made a bargain with her that he would set her and her village free if she could gather one hundred million berries. ( berries... the form of currency in the world of One Piece ). Meanwhile they held her captive at their compound , forcing her to use her skills at map making to set up their own exploitation of the seaboard. It took eight years but Nami finally had colleted almost all of the ransom, by stealing treasure from other pirates.  But Arlong cheated her, and in a deal with a corrupt marine commander had her secret stash of treasure confiscated. Leaving her with no way to pay the ransom. Luffy , learning of her struggle, invaded Arlong's compound and fought him on behalf of Nami, and Nami agreed to join his crew after that.

There is a lot humor , some touching sentimental moments, and some VERY weird battles and insane characters they encounter along the way. It's really the intense characters and bizarre battles that make this series stand out.  I can't think of anything else that compares to it. Once you start watching, you will definitely be hooked on it. The DVD's worked perfectly, great video and audio.  Also, a great feature included on the DVD's in this series is the option for ""Marathon"" Play. That allows you to watch all the episodes on the disk, in a row, without having to watch the opening and closing song segment and credits every time. While there are some violent fights and some drinking/smoking that goes on, I'd rate it a PG level.

It arrived a few week early which was a nice surprise
It's uncut, putting the blood, alcohol and death and anything considered too mature for kids back in.  This means it has more epic phrase and dialogue.
I really recommend this as it's a great start to an a really amazing series
I've seen alot of these episodes before but trust me it's so much better having it on dvd to watch on your tv any time you want whilst on your sofa or bed ^-^  so much so that I've ordered the next five as a result :), so what are you waiting for?",1260144000,,808,3.8323353293413174
3356381,5,B00143XE64,"Currently, there are three mega-popular anime titles: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. They run for over hundreds of episodes, which can be murder on the wallet if you want to buy all three. But, if you can choose to only follow one long running anime series, when it comes to the story One Piece has the strongest, most entertaining arc of all three.

One Piece is about pirates. But, they don't hunt for treasure in the traditional sense, instead it showcases how the bonds of friendship, family, and memories might be the greatest treasures of all.

This two disk set contains the first 13 episodes of this great anime series. Like the other two popular series, One Piece starts relatively simple before picking up stride. Two noteworthy antagonists are found in this volume: Captain Axe-Hand Morgan and Captain Buggy the Clown. As well as introducing three of the main characters: Luffy, Zorro, and Nami. Coming to you uncut and uncensored from Funimation, with dual audio: English, or Japanese with English Subtitles. This isn't that crappy version you might have spotted on Saturday mornings from 4Kids.

And now, through the magic of the internet, you can preview One Piece from Funimation's official webpage: [...]

Simply click, ""Watch Videos Now"" near the bottom left hand of the page, and navigate to which episodes you want to see. Sorry, but it only works in the U.S. and Canada. Try watching the first few episodes, or watch the entire first season online.",1259884800,,1468,4.907258064516129

3356383,5,B00143XE64,"That for some reason i never really got into One Piece.  Maybe it was because of it being censored or something.  But either way, i recently bought the First Voyage of One Piece and it makes a huge difference.  I love the series now and plan on getting the rest of them in the near future.  The characters are crazy funny with their own quirks and ambitions that they are trying to achieve.  Be it the Head Pirate over all others, being the best swordsman in all the land or the best thief ever.  All the characters have something that brings them together good or bad.  I love the battles between the different characters.  But i also love when they go back and tell how the characters got to where they are now.

It's a great opening to the series and if it's any indication.  I will watching One Piece for quite awhile.  This is the version to get not the 4Kids disaster.  It's not even close at all.",1248652800,,903,4.27810650887574
3356384,5,B00143XE64,"Forget the 4Kids version, this is the real one. I was unsure about this series at first, then I read some great reviews of this show. If you like pirate themed stories, or movies like POTC, you will love this. Unfortunatly this series has 13 episodes. Once you start watching, you will get hooked onto this show.

Here is a minor description on the episodes (Spoiler Alert):

Ep 1 : Introduction of Luffy, the main character
Ep 2-3 : Captain Morgan Arc
Ep 4: Luffy's past
Ep 5-8: Buggy The Clown Arc
Ep 9-13: Captain Kuro Arc - continues in the Second Voyage as well",1247097600,,566,4.380952380952381
3356385,5,B00143XE64,"One Piece is the best of anime right now. It's a long running anime and is approaching four hundred episodes at this point. Full of imaginative characters and creative story plots, One Piece is an addictive show that only gets better as it goes along.
I had the misfortune of seeing the first American release of One Piece and it nearly made me dismiss it as cartoony garbage. But my brother discovered it uncut so I ended up watching One Piece the way it was meant to be seen and there was no going back.
The first release doesn't even scratch the surface of how good this show is, but it's a fantastic start and it introduces four of the main characters. Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Usopp. All the episodes are really great but I'm partial to the last arc on this set which is continued into the next set. It features the introduction of Usopp and is definitely the most intense arc of this set.
Funimation's release of One Piece leaves nothing to be desired. An excellent dub for those who don't mind watching it in English. And as for extras there's a pretty great commentary.
All in all there's really nothing around like One Piece and it's about time it got the release it deserved in this country.",1239235200,,1198,4.45
3356386,5,B00143XE64,"If anyone remembers, 4Kids ruined the first American TV run of ""One Piece"" with a god-awful opening song rap and other terrible dubs.

However, for the most part, Funimation does a great job with all the dubs and the special features in ""First Voyage (Uncut).""

This is ""One Piece"" as it was meant to be seen. Characters gets scarred up by swords and other weapons, but Luffy and his friends manage to take out plenty of evil pirates, while helping other people along the way.

Luffy wants to travel on the Grand Line to find treasure, to become the world's greatest pirate and to return his straw hat to his idol, Captain Shanks. Luffy's friends also want to travel for their own reasons. Roronoa Zoro wants to become the world's greatest swordsman, for his friend Kuina. Nami is a pirate pickpocket who doesn't want to join Luffy, but she still admires Luffy's courage and passion for his friends.

Overall, ""One Piece"" follows the typical shonen format, in which superpowered characters beat up villains with special powers. However, ""One Piece"" has tons of charming characters. Luffy always reveals his presence at the most inconvenient times, saying whatever he feels like saying. Zoro is a cool-headed swordsman, wielding swords in both hands and a sword in his mouth. And Nami is much tougher and more cunning than Kaoru (from Rurouni Kenshin) could ever be.

There are a couple quips. Funimation dubbed English voices to sing the original TV theme, which sounds somewhat better than the 4Kids rap, but still awful. And some of the dubs are mediocre. For example, one of the marines in episode one threw a grappling hook and missed a barrel in the ocean. Then his buddy says, ""HA!HA!HA! You suck!"" Overall, though, the voice actors do a good job. Luffy's voice actor is especially great at capturing the Gum-gum punch voice.

So, don't be afraid of some of the slightly mediocre dubs or the somewhat unconventional character designs. This is an excellent shonen anime that never stops losing momentum. The fights are intense and the characters are unforgettable. And although ""First Voyage"" ends in the middle of the epic battle between Captain Kuro and Django, it's a great introduction to an awesome series.",1235952000,,2216,4.896

This DVD the first 2 story arcs of One Piece, plus half of the Captain Kuro arc. It's enough to quench your thirst for the lovely series i think.

It also contains Dual Tracks for those who can't stand to read subtitles and those who absolutely adore them. It's all for you!

3356399,5,B00143XE64,"I've been a faithful reader of One Piece since August of 2003, in fact it was the first manga I ever read, and I fell in love with it from the start. Naturally, I was overjoyed when I heard it would be coming to the US in anime format on the Fall of 2004 on the formally known Fox Box. Of course what I say was a terrible regurgitated American washed TV cartoon for children of 5 and younger. I was rather upset at how badly people, such as the FCC, ruined my favorite manga. After 2 years of disappointment, 4kids TV cancelled the already heavily edited show. Since I don't have cable, that was the last I'd see of it... Until today. This new unedited, uncut version of the manga I so dearly love is far superior to it's terrible American counterpart, if it can even be called that. All the cursing, alcohol, actual violence, and blood remain perfectly in tact, not to mention the outstanding improvement in dialogue. Any one who has read the manga or seen the show should definitely purchase this. Thank you Funimation, you've saved my favorite anime.",1222300800,,1053,4.461139896373057

Secondly, I'd like to agree with the previous post about how many box sets will be required to complete the set! 30+ is too many!!

Finally however, and this is the scary part, how long will this take if Funimation stick by there statement of releasing 2/3 sets per year!!! I can tell you now that in 10 years time DVD will be pretty much redundant, and I wouldn't be surprised if Funimation decide to drop it before then in favor of re releasing it on blu-ray with more episodes.

So, although I do recommend this set to new comers, if your after the complete series I'd hold out to see what Funi decide to do, we all know what happened with DBZ ;)",1221609600,3,807,4.193548387096774
3356401,5,B00143XE64,"Totally awesome show. I don't own the dvd and will explain why shortly. However I have seen every episode aired so far in japan via fansubs online. This show starts out good and stays good throughout.

Now is the problem part. This show is almost 400 episodes long so far in japan and shows no signs of slowing down at all. Then Funimation releases this set. I am very happy as many people are that they made these dvds uncut finally, unlike the 4kids version garbage. However this box holds 13 episodes....anyone want to do the math on how many boxes will be required to hold just the current ~400 episodes? Its 30 boxes. for the first 400 episodes, plus at least 100 more episodes probably or more.

What I ask for and want, is much larger box sets, use a slim form factor of some kind or other and release box sets with like 50 episodes if possible. Then I would have to buy far fewer boxes and it would take up less shelf space. I know this is mostly just semantics and personal preference, but I'm not the only one who feels this way and for a show this insanely long, more expansive box sets are necessary. Asking for this concession seems more than reasonable to me, if not an outright obvious thing to do.

Lastly, How many shows do you know that run 400 episodes plus and stay good the whole time? I know of no other. So if you don't mind the size of this box or have no intention of buying more than the first few seasons, then this box is very worth your while. So go and buy it already. Those of us who plan to buy all 560 episodes of the show or however many it ends up being....all we can do is pray they will wise up and give bigger boxes. Good luck to everyone?

Here comes the silly part.
Luffy ate a 'yum yum fruit' or (Devil Fruit). Makes his body rubber. The drawback is he can't swim, and drowns in water.

3356404,5,B00143XE64,"First, I would also like to join in with most of the other reviewers in thanking FUNimation for their handling of this show. I used to hate you guys just as much if not more than 4kids, if you were around in the 1990's you'll probably understand why, but after watching your conduct after you licensed the series and up to it's CN debut I've had a complete change of heart. You guys really fought for us fans, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for you all now. (Hopefully CN will come to their senses and pick up the series again, but if not you can always fall back on the knowledge that most self-respecting One Piece fans are more than willing to buy your releases. (Heck, I bought Movie 8 along with this despite knowing it was utter crap just to help fund your future efforts.)

Anyways, there really isn't much left to say about how awesome this box set is.. Because as it stands most of the other reviewers have already covered everything I was going to say.
However, I can still say that the FUNimation dubbed track for this series is one of the best I have ever come across, almost as good as FMA's dub, and you really should give it chance even if you're a subtitles purist. You can really tell that the actors love their roles and are trying their hardest to do right by the series. I honestly like their portrayals just as much as the performances given from their Japanese counterparts, and given how long I've been watching the series in Japanese that's saying a lot.

One nitpick though: More extras next time please... D:",1215820800,5,1545,4.417543859649123

It's great, of course, to watch the show in it's original Japanese and it looks clean and sounds great too.  The dubbing is impressive too, with much care being taken into all of the characters and the way they would speak in English.  It was quite clear to me that the voice acting was being directed by someone who loves OP as much as I do.  For the first time in a very long time, I can say I watched the whole of the entire 2 DVD sets' English dubbing.

3356407,4,B00143XE64,"One Piece has been around for almost 10 years in Japan now, and after all that time we finally get a dub for this great series that's done right. After 4kids butchered the series I had lost all hope of One Piece ever reaching an American audience in the way it was supposed to. With Funimation controling the dub now things are much better. This is uncut as advertised, nothing has been changed or edited, and features both the new and improved Funimation dub with a new voice cast, and the original japanese audio as well. The quality on the japanese audio is a bit lower than the american audio, but that might be because the original japanese audio for these first episodes was recorded back in 1999. The video quality is excellent however and I have no complaints in that aspect. The extras aren't too bad either with some company trailers, episode commentaries, and the same marathon feature found on their Dragon Ball Z boxsets. The marathon feature just streams all the episodes together without an opening or closing theme.
That's not to say that this boxset doesn't have it's problems. To be honest I really can't stand Luffy's american voice. I know it's a woman doing the voice work and it's definitely hard to hit some of Luffy's notes, so it's not her fault entirely. It's still better than the 4kids Luffy though, in fact, all of the voices are better. But the first time I heard Luffy yell ""I SLEPT SO GREAT!"" I cringed. The voice does get better by the end of the boxset as she is settling in to her role though. The amazon price is excellent and definitely worth the price but the regular listed price goes for $50. $50 for 13 episodes is a lot of money, which brings me to the biggest problem. The series began running in Japan in 1999 and is still going today. As of July 6th, 2008, there are 361 episodes to this series, and a new episode airs just about eveyr week. That brings me to my biggest point. This series probably won't be coming back to TV, and if it did it would be edited again, so to continue to buy each boxset and watch every episode is a major time and money investment. As with all series of this nature, until the main cast of characters fills out the series starts off slow and gets better, but this show is definitely a commitment. If you fall in love with the show from the start then you might think that's worth it, but just be warned of that.
Overall though I think this series is fantastic and Funimation has done a great job of saving this series. For $20 you really should just give it a try.",1215388800,3,2540,4.3949044585987265

The video quality is great, the sound is perfect and I'm watching my favorite anime on the big screen... how can I go wrong? After 4Kidz, I was sceptical of the english dub, but was pleasantly surprised after watching an episode in english. The characters' voices are well made and the script is great as should be expected, and lets not forget the incredibly well made intro-song!! If you're like me and prefers the original voices, they're all in there. The subtitles are dull and boring compared to the hardsubs offered from fansub-groups, but they work well enough and that's all I can wish for.

And for those who've never seen One Piece, but are turned off by its cartoonish look, don't be fooled, give this series a shot. I highly recommend getting this set.",1215388800,2,1077,4.580310880829016
3356410,4,B00143XE64,"I've loved the One Piece manga ever since I started reading it. It was funny, light and amused me to no end. The cartoony artwork actually went well with the characters, how they acted and the whole tone of the story.

The anime, well, not so much. The pink haired little cabin boy who wants to be in the navy, well, in the manga he was funny. In the anime, I wished, repeatedly, that he would just die. The anime annoyed me. Glad it is uncut, but I don't know if I'll buy much more of the anime.",1215216000,,496,4.061224489795919

Instead there is a more serious, although strange, Luffy and a new (more interesting) spin on the story of One Piece.

If you liked the other version for it's constant slap-stick comedy, this may not be for you. But if you like a great story with well placed humor, I would recommend this DVD.",1214611200,2,471,4.517647058823529
3356412,5,B00143XE64,"After waiting for years to see One Piece get some decent treatment in North America, Funi has finally delivered the goods in spades. These 13 episodes cover the beginning of Monkey D. Luffy's quest to become the Pirate King, including the introductions of crewmates Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and also Luffy's fateful childhood encounter with his hero Shanks. The set ends halfway through the ""Kuro"" arc, as the gang fight to protect a village from being pillaged by pirates. To be continued in volume 2.

As mentioned, this is not the horrid 4Kids dub, nor is it a merely serviceable dub like so many other anime shows are saddled with. There's care in the script and the acting, making the English adaptation just as valid and enjoyable as the original Japanese. The original music is intact as well, and even the openings and endings have faithful English counterparts. There's strong production value all around.

About the only thing that keeps this set from being truly ""uncut and unedited"" as billed would have been the inclusion of the original One Piece logo on an alternate angle (Funi uses their gold variation, which removes the Luffy caricature for an actual ""I""). But it's a small quibble on what is otherwise an outstanding set.

Not many shows get a second chance, and few come back as good as this. Highly recommended.",1214092800,9,1335,4.8464912280701755
3356413,5,B00143XE64,"Oh wow! Here it is at long last! One Piece in the states!!
First off, THANK YOU FUNI!!!!!! You saved One Piece!
I'll talk about the plot of the show a little as I'm sure some people who were never into it before will be lured by the low price and the high value.

Monkey D. Luffy is a quarkey fellow who wants nothing more to rule the seas as King of the Pirates. To do this, he must gather some powerful allies and traverse a dangerous sea that is known as the Grand Line. At the end of the Grand Line supposedly awaits the legendary treasure of the former Pirate King. This treasure is simply known as ""One Piece"" and it is said to bring its owner all the wealth, fame, and power the world has to offer, in turn making them the ""King of the Pirates!""

Luffy is helped a long by a special ability he was granted by eating a legendary ""devil fruit"" and that is that his entire body is made of rubber. This is basically grants him extra velocity and force and makes him capable of easily beating most enemies into a bloody pulp. In this volume in particular you will also be introduced to his first 3 comrades.
Zoro - former bounty hunter turned Pirate. He aspires to be the world's greatest swordsman.
Nami - specializes in thievery... wants nothing more than to be filthy rich.
Usopp - a liar and an idiot, but also a genius who is able to think his way around most fights. He invents many gadgets and weapons for his allies to use in battle... also the crew's sharp shooter.
Together these endearing and unforgettable characters come together to bring you one of the greatest and most epic animes of all time!

Now I'll talk about the box... its pretty damn good. Only purists will find faults with it. It's basically a couple of thin paks that hold 6-7 episodes each. It is a little lacking on the special features front, it has a marathon mode that I have yet to try out so I can't tell you much about it and a commentary on the first episode by Mike McFarland(line producer), Colleen Clinkenbeard(Luffy VA), and Chris Sabat(Zoro VA). I found the commentary somewhat interesting as they did talk quite a bit about how crazy it is to create basically 2 different dubs, an editted one for cartoon network that is on episode 170 and an uncut one for DVD that is at episode 1. The only thing that I think you can consider problematic is if you want to watch the english dub you have to listen to Vic Mignogna(i think its him) sing a dubbed intro as well, and while its not terrible and its an impressively close translation, I'm just a sucker for the original japanese openings. Also the ending is dubbed as well... oh well.

This brings me to the dub. It's not bad. I told myself when I got this, the first time I watched it, it would be the dub and now that I've given it a chance it has started to grow on me. When I first heard Luffy's new voice on TV I hated it, but once I sat down and spent some good quality time with the english speaking Luffy I found his voice to be very appropriate and convincing, if not a little raspier than his japanese counterpart. It's just a little hard to get used to any kind of new voice when you've seen 350+ episodes of Japanese Luffy. The rest of the cast is very good and the script is very accurate(yes there is quite a bit of profanity).

In closing I would like to say one more thing. If you originally watched One Piece via fansubs or god forbid you got some bootleg DVDs, it is your duty to buy this. Give funi their proper due and pick it up please.
And anyone else, if you are looking for an epic anime that brings you tons of humor, drama, and some of the most epic(i like this word) battles ever seen in anime, pick this up. I promise you will not be disappointed.

5/5 stars. Buy, don't rent. You want to own this, and you can't beat amazons price. 20 dollars for 13 episodes of anime just doesn't happen that often.",1212883200,3,3868,4.25578231292517

okay how will i start this review ? i watched one piece oh that was years and years ago it was aired on the UK  on toonanime when  i was at secondary school say 6th year it was the 4kids entertaiment edited version at that time i never heard of anime before and i didn't know what it was. at  that time the  Tv show that i became a fan of was Dragonballz and that was new to the UK along with one piece i remeber watching a few episode then i think i stop watching it then when i went to collage they stop showing along with Dragonballz due to mild violence.

I was going buy the one piece dvd's  viz meda but 4kids enteraiment cut all the violnece like blood and swearing.  i read some of the reviews saying not to buy because its edited and not to  waste your money so i kinda held back and waited to see if a new version of one piece would come out. Well now it has Funimation as uncut and unedited it, and its about time why did they take so long?.

one piece season 1 first voyage uncut unedited with  better voice actors if you've watched this you'll recognizes some of the actors voice from Dragonall z. when funimation bring out  new anime shows  on dvd they only have 4 episodes on them but one piece season 1 first voyage it has 13 episodes which is good i really enjoyed watching and couldn't stop laughing.

for one piece fans or if your new to the show  the  main character is Moneky D .Luffy known as straw  hat who wants to be king of the pirates thats going  to travil to the grand line and find the legendary one piece. Luffy ate the devil fruit that gives him incredable powers he has the ability stretch his body like rubber but theres one problem he cant swim thats his biggest weakness.

But before he can adventure  out to the grand line he must find a crew  first  his first crew member  is the GREAT SWORDSMAN PIRATE HUNTER RORONOA ZORO  who his been held by the marines Luffy fights agaisnt the captain of the marines called morgan who makes his navey town fear him Luffy and Zoro team up and defeat him. the first friend that Luffy makes is a boy called Koby who work as a cabin boy for a ugly pirate called Alvida Luffy defeats her easiy and Koby joins the the marines.

episode 4 you find out about Luffy past in how he got his straw hat  from his hero red-haired shanks who is a pirate plus eating the devil fruit Shanks tells Luffy to promise him to return his straw hat in perfect condation. as the episodes gose on Luffy and Zoro fight againt a terrifing powerful  captain buggy the clown pirate that also eat a devil fruit that his body can chop up into piece also they meet a girl called Nami who steal other pirates treasures and she's also a navigator she steals buggys map to the grand line Luffy defeats Buggy and him Zoro and Nami set off for a new adventure they meet another charater called Usopp know as captain Usopp Luffy knew his father when he was a kid but Usopp is a honorable lair who would run through his town yelling pirtes are coming the town people get fed up with his lies. Then Usopp and Luffy see's Kaya butler Kuro talking to  the weird friend Jango  who is a hypnotist  and shock to find out Kuro is captain of the black cat pirates his polt is to kill miss Kaya and take her money and destroy the town.

Usopp runs back to the village to warn everyone  but they don't listen because they all know he's telling lies again he tries to tell Kaya but dosent believe him that Kuro wouldnt do such a thing she thinks its one of Usopps stories. Usopp get shot up Merry and  heads back  to shore to help Luffy and Zoro fight the black cat pirates on the slope.  Then Kaya gets told the truth about her Butler from Merry that he really is a pirate that he going to kill her and take her money .

Luffy end up put to sleep by Jango so Zoro is left to fight the terrifing duo meowban brothers then when you think things couldn't get worse captain Kuro appears at the battle and he's not very happy his own crew are terrifed of him so whats going to happen next? well i'll just have to wait till the next one piece season 1 boxset come out.

i really ejoyed watching the 13 episodes it was worth the wait thanks Funimation looking forward to the rest of one piece series.

if your a one piece fan get the uncut version.",1212624000,,4627,4.199772985244041
3356415,4,B00143XE64,"...that Funimation is respecting this wildly popular show enough to give us One Piece in all it's uncut and unedited glory. Yeah, I really wish there were special features, and I hope and pray with all my might that future releases will contain more episdoes, since - as many have mentioned - One Piece is still going strong at 500+ chapters in the manga and 300+ episodes of the anime.

And it is all oh so good. I am consistently amazed by this show. Sure, it's goofy and adventurous. But it can also be utterly heartbreaking, gut-bustlingly hilarious, and violent enough at points to be wince-worthy. Not that any one of those things is merit enough by itself. It's just that One Piece is all of those things at once and it's so darn seamless. Really. I cannot praise this show highly enough.

That being said, since this is a review of a DVD set and not the entire show, I was unsure about buying this set because it only has the first thirteen episodes, but I bought it in hopes that my purchase would reflect the desire for One Piece among American consumers. Plus, it's fantastic to watch on a large television screen, instead of a small computer screen.

And if you are worried about the English dubbed voices, let me just tell you that I am in love with the original Japanese voices, but my 10-year-old sister has a hard time reading subtitles, so we watched it with the English dub. It does take an episode or two to get used to the new voices, but Funimation has really done a good job. Characters don't have outrageous and stereotypical accents like in the 4Kids dub, and Zoro is actually called ""Zoro"" instead of ""Zolo""! Hurrah!

It's lovely to go back and relive the early days when all our favorite characters first met, and to viewers who are new to the world of One Piece, I want to put it on the record that when I first read One Piece (I read the manga before I saw the anime) it took me quite a while to get into it. Heck, I didn't even like pirates! But all good things take time, and I kept reading, and soon I was hooked. So give it a chance. And if it turns out it's not your cup of tea, then thanks for looking anyways. But you'll never know what you might be missing if you don't try it, right?",1212624000,13,2220,4.316546762589928
3356416,5,B00143XE64,"This series is great! And im so glad it finally got a proper uncut release. All the original openings and endings have been redubbed, all the characters are redubbed, and the script is completely uncut! One Piece is a classic series and im glad its finally not being chopped up for little kids.",1212364800,3,294,4.566037735849057
3356417,5,B00143XE64,"It's been FAR too long in coming, but this new subtitled/dubbed version -- uncut and with all the sweat, blood and tears intact -- is absolutely GORGEOUS. Clear, crisp visuals. Clean sound. NO EDITING. WOO HOO!!

One technical complaint is that the individual episode links don't seem to work on Disk 2. No matter which episode I select, it always starts on the first one on the disk. Annoying, but not deal-breaking. Marathon mode (where you can watch all the episodes on a disk in a row with titles and re-cap cut out) MORE than makes up for this minor production flaw. I just hope they get that sorted out on the next set.

I'm a purist, I admit it. Personally, I listen only to the Japanese track. I know a dub is essential for marketing in the US, but honestly, one is missing SO MUCH of the One Piece experience if one only listens to the dub.

Part and parcel of the One Piece package is the INCREDIBLE voice acting on the part of the Japanese seiyuu; only they seem able to bring these amazing, inspiring, crazy characters to full life. Just watching Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Bazooka or Zoro's Oni Giri in motion doesn't quite do it... you need to *hear* them. Especially the always wacky and delightful Kappei Yamaguchi (more commonly known for his role as Inuyasha) as Usopp the Liar and the series-favorite Kazuki Yao who creates distinctive voices for many of the more, um, *unique* villains along the way (until he finally joins the crew much later!).

I'd really like to see the Japanese versions of the title/ending songs as extras next time too, in addition to the English re-works (which actually are pretty decent). You did *so* much better then 4Kids with this one, Funimation, that it's no real comparison. I like to pretend that horror doesn't even exist, actually. (Now if we could just get Viz to show the manga more respect too.... *heavy sigh*)

THANK YOU for saving One Piece, Funimation. It more than deserves the chance to be as big over here as it still is in Japan after 10 years!

Keep up the good work and... when does the next set come out? I want to buy it right now! *happy grin*",1212105600,14,2110,4.510471204188482

8254148,4,B00143XE64,"One Piece is one of those anime that makes you laugh AND cry . . . And that's one of the reasons why I enjoy it so much. It's been a long time since I found another anime I enjoyed as much as I enjoy One Piece. (The last one I enjoyed this much was Yu Yu Hakusho, another anime classic.)

One Piece is one of those anime that, even though you KNOW the good guys will come out on top, it still manages to make you bite your nails in worry while you wait to see how bad your favorite character will get pummeled. (*SPOILER* It gets more and more violent as the show goes on.) Even though you know that the heroes will be okay, you still legitimately worry if they're really going to be okay. And let me warn you, this series has no qualms about killing or maiming characters.

That being said, this particular set of DVDs is out of print and becoming harder and harder to come by, and it is, in all honesty, less economic to purchase than the re-release:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Piece-Collection-One/dp/B004W75BQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Piece: Collection One</a>&nbsp;This set has 13 episodes, while the Collection One set has 26. And that is why I can only give this set 4 stars. The quality is excellent, but the price is a bit high. However, I like the look of these sets more than the Collections. The packaging has a grittiness that speaks more of the theme of this series: pirates. If you can find a goodused set or get a good deal on eBay or from a seller here, I'd say it's worth it. (I found the First and Second Voyage as a lot on eBay for $35.)

Overall, this is a nice set, and it looks good on my anime shelf. If you want a prettier package, maybe invest in these sets. If you don't care so much about the look of the package, and are just in it for the episodes (as most of you probably are), go for the Collections.",1446681600,,1891,4.459537572254336
