Plus, St Helens, Oregon, where they filmed this is only a half hour away fromus and they are having month long HalloweenTown festivities.
Basically, Marnie is a young teenager who is upset with her mom for Not wanting to celebrate Halloween like a ""normal"" family. She also doesn't get to partake in or watch anything with magic or paranormal or weird movies or activities. She doesn't get it.
Then her grandma comes for her annual Halloween visit and she over hears a conversatiin about how her and her little sister are witches, then steals away to Halloweentown, sneakily when her grandma leaves. Her brother and younger sister come too and they find a whole new world full of magical creatures and people. But theres an evil ine amongst them. Marine and her family must save Hallpweentoen and her family before it's too late.
Then in the 2nd movie, they go back for more adventures!
We seriously love these movies. They are fun for the whole family. You won't regret it!",1472428800,,1102,4.627551020408164
