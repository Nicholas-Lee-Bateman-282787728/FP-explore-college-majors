8279991,5,B00133KFLW,My wife teaches ballroom dance in China and she really likes this set of combinations. I see her working this at least once a week.,1356825600,,131,4.28
8279992,2,B00133KFLW,"This dvd is idealy suited for the beginner, novice, dancer, to learn the basics as it repeats the steps over and over again. However it would make a good gift for a friend,as a starter to get them into dancing.

It is not one I would recommend to the advanced dancer, as you would probably already know these basics.",1284940800,,316,4.3559322033898304
8279993,3,B00133KFLW,"Not for beginners!!  Hence the ""Series 2"" part of the title.  There are 3 Combinations of moves.  Each Combination has 3 stages. Excellent narration!  Combinations are harder than the one before.  I think all of the examples are repeated enough times.  Each stage has sections for the leader, follower, and as a couple. A lot of combinations of moves are taught.  One CAVEAT:  I think it's International Style; not American.  But I still enjoyed it. It's worth the discounted price I paid through Amazon.",1237161600,,504,4.904761904761905
