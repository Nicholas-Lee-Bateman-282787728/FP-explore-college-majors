3826558,4,B001WG761C,"Having seen every episode of Corner Gas I was excited and depressed for the last season. My dad turned me on to the show and was hooked after watching two episodes. All of the characters felt like someone I know or could relate to. Their use of word-play and dry comedy are really refreshing, something that we don't see too much in America. Get this DVD if you have seen all of the other seasons, if you are a newbie I encourage you to get first or second season because there is not a bad episode on them. The special features are short, but very enjoyable and you can tell they love their fans. The final episode is terrific, and the robot episode is hiliarious. But some episodes like the soccer team and or the tv free episodes are kind of lacking. Thanks Brent Butt for all the memories!",1251936000,,793,4.328859060402684

This is a Canadian T.V. sitcom created by Canadian comedian Brent Butt (Yes! That's his real name).  The series ran for six seasons from Jan 22, 2004 to April 13, 2009 for a total of 107 episodes.

Deriving its name from the roadside gas station in the fictional small (very small!) town of Dog River, Saskatchewan, Canada, ""Corner Gas"" is the only gas station within 37 miles (60 km) in any direction.

The characters of this small town are quirky:

Brent Leroy (Brent Butt) is the proprietor of the gas station.  His parents, Oscar (Eric Peterson) whose favorite word is ""jackass"" and Emma (Janet Wright) are life-time residents of Dog River.

Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) works at the station's convenience store as a retail assistant.

An adjoining cafe, ""The Ruby"", is owned by Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller), who inherited it from her Aunt Ruby.

Dog River's Police Department (the ""DRPD"") consists entirely of veteran Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal) and rookie Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn).

Brent's best friend, the perpetually unemployed Hank Yarbo (Fred Ewanuick) spends his time hanging out with Dog River residents or drinking coffee at the Ruby.

A number of notable Canadian celebrities and politicians appear as guest stars or have cameo roles in many episodes.

Most of the episodes are stand-alone and can be viewed in any order.

This very funny show, which was filmed entirely in Saskatchewan, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode.  In Saskatchewan, April 13 is known as ""Corner Gas Day.""  This show is presently televised in 26 countries.

I found that season six (the last season) of Corner Gas retained its quirky characters and all episodes retained the humour I've come to expect.  Michael Buble has a small role in one of the episodes.

Finally, there are four extras with this DVD set (released in 2009): (1) final episode read-through (2) CTV special: it's been a gas (3) cast interviews (4) Craig Northey on the exceptional music.  These are quite good.

In conclusion, the sixth season of the hit comedy ""Corner Gas"" presents more episodes in the life of a small town where there's ""not a lot goin' on.""

Warning!!  Once you become addicted to this series, you officially become a ""Butt head.""

(2008-2009;  19 episodes on 3 discs;  22 min per episode; total time: 418 min or almost 7 hrs;  wide screen)

3826621,5,B001WG761C,Corner Gas was extremely funny and the wacky characters meshed well together.  It is too bad this one didn't get more play in U..S. but I thank WGN in Chicago for the short time they did show it as seeing the shows got me hooked and I ended up buying all the seasons.  None of them disappointed.,1417132800,,295,4.157894736842105
3826622,3,B001WG761C,"All episodes work on my Australian Sony blu-ray player so that is a huge plus. I am however unhappy with the quality of the case sleave and material inside as it looks to me like it has been printed off a cheap colour printer. The jacket sleave is of low resolution and is very blurry; the user guide inside is of equally poor quality with blurry low res pictures; and the dvds themselves look like they have had a cheap printer print the dvd cover.

All in all I am happy to have the final season on dvd with the episode quality up to scratch with what I would expect, and this is the main thing. The rest is annoying and disappointing but not everything in life is perfect and for the price it will do. I just wish Madman Entertainment and SBS would release the last three seasons on dvd here in Australia, rather than having to go through Amazon in the US.",1416873600,,859,4.237804878048781

3826625,5,B001WG761C,"Being American, I've been deprived of the funniest TV series ever. So, I had to purchase the series on DVD. I had been watching the previous seasons to the point of addiction, so it was only natural that I buy season 6, the final season. The only bad thing about this DVD set was that this was the last season of the series. Bravo to the geniuses that created a hysterical series that is both family friendly and so much fun to watch. I cannot wait for the Corner Gas Movie.

You will not be disappointed in this final season!",1412208000,,526,4.26

3826628,5,B001WG761C,"Although this is not the best season, Season 6 continues the tradition of this show's entertaining qualities and rapid fire jokes. The first episode, ""Full Load"", is one of my personal favorites. When Karen accidentally sells Hank's truck at a police auction, new owner, Wanda, makes sure Hank knows she owns his truck. Another favorite of mine is ""Cat River Daze"" in which Lacey tries to raise money to save the Dog River Days event. A dunk tank with Hank and Davis is the center of this scenario. The other scenario is Oscar falling in love with a stray tom cat, and the lengths he goes to in order to keep it.

The bonus features on this DVD include cast interviews and the Final-through of the last episode. You can see the heavy emotion in each of the actors as the final lines are read.

I highly recommend this DVD for Corner Gas fans and those who like sitcoms about ""nothing."" I also am looking forward to the Corner Gas Movie!",1407024000,,936,4.4678362573099415

3826676,5,B001WG761C,"Season 6 of Corner Gas (sadly the last season of the series) is one of six as the best in witty humor interlaced between the characters of each of the 6 seasons. I just happened upon the show late night on cable and was instantly hooked and logged on to Amazon to buy season one. Since then I have ordered (one by one to make the exeperience last) each season and watched each episode with captive attention because I knew there were only six seasons in the series. The storylines and characters lull you in and soon you find yourself a loyal fan. If you like sitcoms, Corner Gas is a gem that must be watched, and upon the first episode you find yourself wanting to watch the next and soon you will be a resident of Dog River. It is disappointing that there were only 6 seasons and is the only drawback of the series. LIVES",1323388800,,824,4.254777070063694
3826677,2,B001WG761C,"Season 6 marks a real drop off in series quality - poor writing and non-committal acting, with an overall bitter undertone. You may want to avoid it. Lots of the dialogue is just nasty, with no pretense of being humorous. The Wanda character, especially, is now just mean, and everyone else, (writers, directors, actors), seemed to be mailing it in. In many episodes from earlier seasons the characters were exasperated by each other, but there was still always a genial aspect to the good-natured ribbing. Here, there is a lot of edge with no saving cheer.

We really enjoyed the previous seasons, but this season was not just not entertaining, it was so sour that it detracted from our fondness for the characters and for the earlier episodes. We finally tossed this season's DVD and agreed to pretend it didn't exist.",1322092800,3,820,4.815602836879433

I still recommend it if you have the first five.  It is a definitive blending of small town life (anywhere), laid back querky Canadian humor at its best and has a great assemble cast of characters you can't help but fall in love with.

3826692,5,B001WG761C,"When I first saw part of an episode in season 1, I was somewhat unimpressed. But, after watching a second episode, I was totally hooked on the combination of almost slapstick as well as dry humor in this series. This series is very very funny. Canada has produced some of the best television  I have seen of late. If you like a cleaner variety of humor then something like, say, Trailerpark Boys, then this is the series for you.
This series is totally addictive. I would suggest buying season 1 first and then working your way through all the seasons. This show has a following even way down here in Florida. The cool thing about Corner Gas is that the whole family can enjoy it, and in my case, my whole family likes the show. And that's something of a rarity in my house.",1273536000,2,774,4.375

3826697,5,B001WG761C,"Corner Gas concludes its six-year run in this fitting tribute to the spectacular cast and crew of one of the best comedy shows of this decade. Season Six continues show creator Brent Butt's classic humor of a pleasantly dysfunctional Saskatchewan town where everything is everyone's business, whether they like it or not. With comedic throwbacks to the '70s and encounters with modern conveniences like security systems, each episode is rife with the pleasant diversions from hectic real life that viewers have come to expect from our adopted home town of Dog River, Saskatchewan. Enjoy yourselves, even if there's 'not a lot goin' on!'",1264809600,,636,5.184466019417476

3826700,4,B001WG761C,"I purchased Corner Gas season 6 dvd from Amazon.ca, the canadian branch of Amazon because the price was much lower than in the US, even with shipping costs.  Check the exchange rate, the Canadian dollar is usually less than the US dollar.

Season 6 has 19 new episodes that were not broadcast in the USA by WGN.  Some episodes are very good and some are OK but still enjoyable.  Some of the best episodes are:
""Full Load"" were Lacey wins an eating contest,
""American Resolution"" Oscar's nationality is in question,
""Shirt Disturber"" Brent and Hank travel to a comic book convention,
""Super Sensitive"" Davis tells too many blonde jokes and gets sent to sensitivity training,
""R2 Bee Too"" Hank and Davis get toy robots,
""Crab Apple Cooler"" Brent and Hank re-visit an old neighbor they played pranks on,
""Happy Career Day to You"" Brent finds a 30 year old snack cake in the store,
""Get the F Off My Lawn"" a wind storm blows the letters of the cafe
and ""You've Been Great, Goodnight"" the show's finale.

Season 6 does not have as many knock-out shows as the earlier seasons, but you won't be disappointed either.  If you are a fan you'll definetly enjoy it.",1262908800,6,1153,4.6
