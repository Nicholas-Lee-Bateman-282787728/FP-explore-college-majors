3898508,5,B002BWP4C4,"A young girl, barely 7 years old, is left to fend for her little sister when their mother leaves them both in the hands of a distracted and insensitive aunt.  Promised by their mother that if they were good their aunt would give them coins and that she would come back when their piggy bank was full, the children improvise ways to earn small change and fill up the bank, hoping to hasten their mother's return.

So Yong Kim's follow up to the wonderful and understated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Between-Days/dp/B000VS6LY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Between Days</a>&nbsp;is a revelation of a film.  Shot in a style that captures simple nuances of childhood without artifice, the film is also a formal masterpiece.  Every shot is framed with care and precision, captures subtleties of gesture and emotion that feel utterly authentic, or captures settings and light and other natural elements to give a haiku-like accent to the mood of surrounding scenes.  To say that this film is shot documentary-style is technically true, but may give the false impression of a amateur home-movie style video or shaky cameras and this film is nothing like that.  In its formal precision that captures the essence of the reality it depicts rather than the raw subject matter the film is closer to work by the Dardenne Brothers or to that of Robert Bresson, than to the more ad hoc and improvised ""documentary-style"" cinematography of the Office television series or of something like Cloverfield or even District 9.

A delicate and lovely film about the fragility and resilience of childhood.  Highly recommended.",1264118400,28,1653,5.355212355212355

3898510,5,B002BWP4C4,"I'm surprised I don't find more discussions about this movie. Why, because it is one of the best family movies I've seen and it portrays one of the saddest issues - that is the effect of adoption, divorce, foster care - all the estrangements that can occur between children and guardians.
What makes this movie different are the brilliant actors and the classy filming and editing. Never mind the sub-titles the movie just visually tells a story, some of the best scenes come from the subtle smiles and natural movements that only a child could render.
Fortunately this DVD comes with extras, whether through deleted scenes or interviews with the two leads that add comedy and poignancy to the film.
Amazingly two actors age five and seven are able to deliver a striking performance.",1254528000,26,783,4.850746268656716
3898511,5,B002BWP4C4,"Director and Writer So Yong Kim has drawn from some of her memories growing up in Korea.  The 2008 Korean film tells the story of two little girls, 4 and 6, who with resilence and tenacity manage abandonment and without understanding how traumatic abandonment and a mother's betrayal can be.

The film is not told, but it is a a view through the eyes and soul of two young girls who are left by their mother who told the girls she needed to find their father.  They are pushed off on an uncaring alcoholic aunt and then shuttled again.

What is important about this film is that it isn't the experience of adults, as the role of adults is minimal.  The experience is raw and directly from the young girls, what they see, what they hear, what they feel, and their determination to get back with their mother.

What you see is images of children, making their way in an adult world.  The film takes place in the congested streets of Seoul to the rural countryside.  One of the most poignant scenes is where they stand tall trying to get a glimpse of their mother as she boards a bus, not to come back for them.  Many people will identify with these two girls, shuffled around, abandoned.  The film may appear to move slow at times, but it is critical to the pace of their desertion.  .....Rizzo",1253404800,4,1292,4.409282700421941
3898512,5,B002BWP4C4,"Treeless Mountain was utterly charming, a far more upbeat take on a situation somewhat similar to Hirokazu Koreeda's tragic ""Nobody Knows"" (""Dare mo shiranai"", 2004).  A 30ish big-city single mom in dire financial straits drops off her seven and five-year-old daughters with the 50ish 'Big Aunt', her sister-in-law, a functioning alcoholic in a small town, who a few weeks later in turn dumps them on their 70ish maternal grandparents, who live on a rather primitive farm.

Mom has given the girls a piggy bank, and said she'd return by the time they've filled it, a white lie, of course, but the kids start collecting impaling and charbroiling grasshoppers (yum -- healthful animal protein) to sell to big aunt's neighbors at ten cents a pop.  Then they discover that ten pennies take up more bank space than a dime, and engage in some currency conversion.  Even though the piggy's now full, mom doesn't show up.  Later, at the farm, the girls offer grandma the bank to buy herself new winter shoes.

It's not all sunshine.  The girls have their quirks.  Jin, the older daughter, has a bed-wetting problem, and frames little sister Bin, who gets revenge later.  There are lots of little touches like that in all the characters, but it's all understated, and much is implied without being obvious.  The overall impression is of a society that values its kids highly, and the extended family structure makes what might otherwise have been a tragic situation bearable and even light-hearted at times.  On the commentary track, the director reveals she's dedicated the film to her own grandmother, the movie having been somewhat autobiographical.",1253059200,19,1643,5.0036764705882355
3898513,5,B002BWP4C4,"I felt like I was swept into my own childhood through the lives of these little girls.  Their experience was easily reminiscent of mine (most everyone's?) as I recognized the condition of the universal child, shown, not told, at the mercy of the events and the people in their lives.  I saw the conclusions drawn by the sisters, due to occurrences--conclusions that were sometimes right and sometimes in error as they strove to make sense of and find some small modicum of control in their experience.  Their innocence endured all, giving hope that somewhere within us still exists that same innocence.  What is more, the encouragement to believe that innocence still remains crowns the film, endorsing life in all its difficulty, scarcity and hopeful endurance. The movie has relatively little dialogue.  The meaning is artfully implied by watching the girls as they react to the people and happenings around them.  It is a profound experience of cinematic  deduction--truly unique in its manner of delivering its message.  Bravo!",1250467200,3,1031,5.131736526946108
3898544,5,B002BWP4C4,"When children are shuffled from family member to family member, it is too often told with good guys and bad guys. Treeless Mountain makes us sad not only for the two young sisters in their despondent journey, but for the misguided guardians along the way. Like real people those adults make decisions that make us feel right in judging them and in the next breath gain our sympathy by showing us they are just doing their best. The ending is one of both unfortunate reality and hopeful resilience.

Endearing turns from both of the young girls, the neighbor of the aunt, and the grandmother, but all do a fine job. The girls' attempts at fulfilling the piggy bank promise is a wonderfully vivid metaphor that's applicable to us all at any age.",1337212800,,743,4.628787878787879
3898545,5,B002BWP4C4,"For most of this film, the camera stays focused on the faces of two little girls.
Somehow, through their actions and reactions, I knew every setting in this exceptional film.
I cried throughout most of it, although it does reward the viewer with a tiny glimmer of happiness at the end.  Jin is a gifted little actress who is able to convey her confusion and sadness through a face like an emotionless doll.  Bin, her little sister, holds on to all she has ... a 6 yr. old older sister.
The adult characters in this film are rich through little dialogue.  But the emphasis is on the girls.  Five minutes into it, you won't be able to turn it off.
A simply marvelous, wonderfully made film you won't soon forget.  Kudos.",1333324800,,718,4.450381679389313
3898546,1,B002BWP4C4,"This is the most boring movie I've ever watched. (SPOILER INCLUDED IN REVIEW). The director is big on silence, close-up shots, and long shots of nothing but black. It could have been saved with some kind of resolution, but it ends abruptly with no rhyme or reason. An abandoned mother can't support her two small girls (seven and four?) and after being kicked out of their apartment, Mom leaves the girls with her sister-in-law while going off to find her husband. The treatment of the older girl is very realistic, showing her anger, hurt and confusion. The magical aspect of the piggy bank has been covered elsewhere, and the scenes of the girls waiting at the bus stop are heart-breaking. Then sister-in-law gets a letter from Mom saying things haven't worked out with husband, and Mom can't take care of girls, so please take them to Mom's parents' farm. The girls are duly dropped off at the farm, where grandmother is kind and loving. They all go out to the forest to look for wood and other things, then we see a field, then the girls, hand-in-hand are climbing a hill and singing a folksong, and then the credits roll, leaving one with the feeling that surely there's more to the ending than this.

If you're teaching a class on how not to make a film, buy this one. If you want a good Korean movie, buy ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring."" Also atmospheric, but not pretentious, like this one.",1332633600,2,1410,4.64
3898547,5,B002BWP4C4,"""Treeless Mountain"" is a beautiful and emotionally affecting film. In the film, two young girls are left in the care of an uncaring aunt so that the mother can supposedly go look for her estranged husband. She tells the girls she will return before too long, but it soon becomes clear (through a letter to the aunt) that she simply is unable to care for the children any more. So the aunt, on the advice of the mother, takes the children to their grandparents farm to stay. The children develop a close bond to the kind grandmother and they start to feel comfortable in their surroundings.

The two children, who had never acted before, gave incredibly beautiful performances. Six-year-old Hee Yeon Kim played the role of Jin while four-year-old Song Hee Kim played her younger sister Bin. I found it so easy to fall in love with these two beautiful children. They performed with such a naturalness and softness that they seemed like real sisters. The chemistry was so strong between them. And So Young Kim did a remarkable job as writer and director of the film. Her style of direction put all the focus on the two girls and their circumstances. And even though times were sometimes difficult for the girls, there is such a soft and delicate air about the film. I think ""Treeless Mountain"" is one of the best films about childhood ever made. And it does such a good job of showing the resilience that children have in adapting to difficult situations. I would give this film more than 5 stars if I could; it's really that good. And I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",1330819200,2,1574,4.621428571428571
3898548,5,B002BWP4C4,"Resilience of children, the hope, the literal translation of what parents say, and the need to be loved and wanted.  Ooh my, it was soo moving that you realize when you speak with kids, don't lie, tell them the truth.  When I saw these kids waiting for their um based on her words that she would retun when their piggy bank was full.. They sold grilled grasshoppers to raise money to fill that piggy bank.  And stil the mum did not make an appearance.  These two children ,so young, did such a realistic performance that it was hard to remind yourself that it is only a movie: but yet depicting real life in some other families, some other siblings.  You will be moved and it is so worth watching.  A piece of that movie now sits in my soul.",1330300800,,741,4.294964028776978
3898549,4,B002BWP4C4,"Treeless Mountain is a heartbreaking and stark docu-drama about two abandoned girls. As I watched these young children (5 & 7) make their way through their Korean world, I thought of similarly aged children here in the U.S. and how sheltered and spoiled they are comparatively. How relative is hardship?

That issue aside, Treeless Mountain is a lovely, albeit slow, and often sad movie that underscores the strength of children and the flexibility of family and community. Despite being bandied about from a mother who can't support them to an aunt who doesn't wish to care for them, they press on with strikingly strong survival skills and a deep love for each other. Their innocence, trust, and purity of heart are tested by a world that takes little note of them as they wait hopefully for their mother to return. Eventually, the two girls end up in the sympathetic and loving care of their grandmother, whose genuine tenderness and concern bring joy and song back into their lives.

The director uses shots of the sky as segues from one scene to another. One memorable and poignant transition shows the sun enveloped by a dark and sinister looking cloud. Just as the shot ends, the sun breaks free on the other side of the cloud's mandible-like grasp. It's powerful and beautiful, just like this movie.",1328918400,,1307,4.830357142857143
3898550,5,B002BWP4C4,"Treeless Mountain loosely reflects the personal experiences of writer-director So Yong Kim who grew up in South Korea and immigrated to the U.S. when she was twelve years old. It is a meticulously observed portrait of two Korean girls, ages 5 and 7, coping with the terrors of having to rely mostly on their own resources when their mother leaves to search for their estranged father. Like Kelly Reichardt's minimalist Wendy and Lucy, not much happens in the way of plot but the film is less about what happens externally than internally - in the character's tentative groping toward maturity.

Kim's camera is always close to the girls' faces, allowing us to see the world through their eyes. It is still an innocent world but one that is becoming more knowing and, unfortunately, more acclimatized to the lies of adults. When seven-year-old Jin (Hee Yeon Kim) and her younger sister Bin (Song Hee Kim) are left by their mother (Soo Ah Lee) in the care of an alcoholic aunt (Mi Hyang Kim), she gives them a piggy bank and tells them that each time they listen to ""Big Aunt"", a coin will be deposited in their bank. When it is filled, she will return. Big Aunt is cold and cranky and clearly cannot handle the responsibility of caring for the young girls but is more annoying than abusive, calling them a ""pain"" to be around and berating young Bin for bed wetting.

In one scene, Jin, the oldest girl wakes up to find she has wet the bed.  When questioned, Jin tells Big Aunt that her little sister, Bin, wet the bed.  Big Aunt becomes very angry and punishes the girls by giving Bin a bowl and making her wear a bamboo cape and tells them to beg the neighbors for salt.  This is an old-school Korean form of punishment designed to humiliate and shame a bedwetter (maybe not practiced in big cities but in small villages and rural areas). In another, she demands money from a neighbor for a minor scratch Bin suffers when playing with her son. Bin and Jin manage to find friendship, however, with a little handicapped boy and pass the time by capturing and roasting grasshoppers to sell on the streets to help fill their piggy bank. When they discover that they can exchange one large coin for many small ones, they are one step closer to what they believe will be their mother's return. When the bank is filled, the girls wait for their mother at the bus stop, losing faith with each bus that comes and goes without their mother. It is a heartbreaking scene that brings back memories of classic neorealist films of the past.

Optimism and inner strength surface again, however, when, after receiving a letter from the girls' mother, Big Aunt delivers them to their grandparents farm in the countryside. In their return to nature, they can at last breathe free and open themselves to the caring they so desperately need. Recruited through the director's observations of children at local Korean schools rather than through talent agencies, the performances of Hee Yeon Kim and Song Hee Kim are models of authenticity.

There is never any sense that they are simply acting or going through the motions, these little girls are AMAZING and the story of how those little actors were chosen is a story in itself. In the tradition of Koreeda's Nobody Knows, and Ozu's I Was Born But.., Treeless Mountain avoids histrionics or crowd pleasing sentimentality. It is a film about particular children but one that has universal appeal, touching everyone who has experienced the fear of abandonment at one time or another. That means all of us.",1327190400,2,3532,4.696284329563813
3898551,2,B002BWP4C4,I thought maybe it was just me but after my sister and my mother watched the movie ..they provided the same feedback...basically...it's alright.  Not the attention retentive movie.  The movie background/concept sounded great but the outcome left me disappointed and wanting to return the movie...,1326758400,,296,5.555555555555555

3898553,5,B002BWP4C4,"Although I've often raved to friends about this film, I don't often recommend that they rush out and watch it.  It's slow and elegiac and lacks the kind of italics that American audiences are used to.  There's no music or sweeping camerawork to suggest how we're supposed to feel about anything.  And though its dramatic structure is earnest, it's also nearly invisible.

And yet, still, to me . . . it's an astonishing and beautiful movie, mostly because of the performances of the two little girls, who are captured on camera--not ""acting""--but merely behaving.

Maybe, if you understand all that, you'll like this movie too.

I'll also add this: a few weeks after seeing it, I also saw Jim Cameron's AVATAR in a theatre.  It was admittedly spectacular.  And yet, three days later, I found myself not caring about anything or anyone on the planet Pandora.  Instead, I was still worrying about those two little girls in Korea . . . .",1308009600,5,934,4.716049382716049
3898554,5,B002BWP4C4,"One of the few Korean words I know is Halmoni, from a story I read with third graders when I taught it. (totally off topic I am transferring back to 3rd, looking forward to the story once again)
Interestingly I learned a few more Korean words from this film I caught today on Sundance.
Bin and Jin are very like two children that I might be teaching, caught in financial collapse as their mother drops them on her sister, Big Aunt, an alcoholic who goes on and fails them as well. Mom is caught in a deceit telling them she'll be back when they fill a small piggy bank.  The film really introduces us into this time of crisis for these kids.  They are so darling- they do amazingly filling their bank to try to get Mom home through utter ingenuity. Coin exchanging, as well as solid entrepreneurial creativity. But in doing so, they learn she is ""a liar."" (Things trigger memories, this reminded me of one of my own-a promise unkept about the taking of a family to San Diego for a vacation for which I saved for years-but a divorce was really what I got when the bank had the amount I was required to save from money I never used for shoes and clothing.) In the movies near end in a key scene the older sister takes the bank to her grandmother as she has realized her grandmother has awful shoes, after asking her for winter shoes for them both-and then understanding Halmoni has terrible shoes. I saw this as the child gaining empathy capacity. And in that moment I felt the film suggested that from our struggles comes our capacity to see and care for others-the real genius in the work.....Along the way in quiet scenes we glimpse the world from the child's space. It is poetic. Just scenes like a long shot on a cloud are embedded with implication, feeling.  Big Aunt takes them to their grandparents who live in a very rural, simplistic, yet oddly comforting and real way. I found that the happy ending actually, that they found a way to family, support, care.

I started to think about why I kept watching. The children were beautiful. They played like children play, they related like children relate. The wordlessness and the feelings of children in events such as this was conveyed. I teach 6 year olds. One child had a crisis, he took a lollipop from another. But in unwinding this this child one of 5 siblings in a broken family in troubled times, with different absent fathers told his mother to call me that afternoon and she did.  Slowly and in such a puzzle piece kind of way of communication I learned she was a week in a hospital, still there, about to lose her baby, with 107 fever, had been iced, so on. He was dealing with all of this in a wordless vacuum. All I saw was a stolen pop and a boy that looked unfeeling. But surely is not. He's actually deeply wanting to do well. Understand, communicate his meanings. I think the movie conveys something of this child-iverse a place where things just happen, and you are wrapped in the realities in the moment. And aren't able to formulate a verbal narrative. In this way, how it was shot, the piece is brilliant.

It's a very moving film but it ends in a way that left me feeling I'd still like to go along with the girls watching time pass. Teach them a song or two, be their teacher. I know we would enjoy our time together.",1303603200,,3294,4.400656814449918
3898555,5,B002BWP4C4,"I saw this movie two days ago and I'm still thinking about it. Amazing performances by two child non-actors. Their mother (single, tired and struggling) leaves them with their neglectful aunt while going in search of their father... or was that just an excuse to abandon the children she is unable to raise on her own?

The mother leaves the girls with a piggy bank, promising to return when the girls have filled it completely.  The girls show maturity beyond their years, finding creative ways to fill their piggy bank while also displaying the innocence and hopefulness of a child while waiting for their mother to return. Their faces and expressions are haunting and heart tugging. As hard as it was to watch them struggle with their aunt, it was satisfying to see them receive more attention and love from their elderly grandmother.

I would love a sequel with a happy ending. Wishful thinking?

In response to a reviewer who gave this movie 1 start and called it boring, well, anyone who needs special effects, car chases and other ""action"" may find this movie ""boring"".  However, I think anyone with a heart, compassion and sensitivity will love this movie.

As a side note: the young girl who played the younger sister in this movie was discovered in a foster home. Knowing this while I was watching this movie really tugged at my heartstrings. I saw a wisdom, playfulness and strength in her that was humbling. Does anyone know what happened to her after this movie was filmed?",1279929600,6,1486,4.762645914396887
3898556,4,B002BWP4C4,"Disney would have turned a movie of this premise into an adventure. Writer/director Kim So Yong wanted something more realistic. The result isn't a film for everyone. It's not for people who need dramatic arcs to propel them thru a film. This one tries to avoid anything formulaic like a plot. (It doesn't quite succeed at that. There are moments that feel like dramatic construction.) But it avoids paroxysms and moves at naturalistic pace. Overall, it feels like a series of glimpses of real life.

The film focuses on the bewilderment of two children and that no doubt springs from the Kim So Yong's own experience of being left in the care of her grandparents on a farm as her divorced mother went to the US to build a life for her and her children. (Kim So Yong would emigrate to the US at age 12.) In the movie, the mother instead hunts for her husband. Her motive is only implied - it is clear that she needs financial help to care for her two daughters - and perhaps more.

The film strives for and achieves a constant oppressive mood of abandonment. This is enforced by the use of muted lighting and color and the use of mostly hand-held closeups of the girls. The closeups give the movie a strongly personal tone, as if seeing and feeling the children's innermost thoughts. But it's also claustrophobic and the few establishing shots feel like respites.

The child actresses are a delight and -- while not quite natural in front of the camera -- So Yong keeps them convincing enuf. The two trained actresses who play the mother and the aunt are very good. But it's the appeal of the two girls (the youngest in a princess gown) that carries the film.

A lot of credit must also go to Anne Misawa's carmerawork and the ability to make visuals that seem artless altho they really are finely crafted. The now-iconic scene of the two girls standing atop a mound of dirt (the treeless mountain?) is just one example to be found in the movie.

I don't know if it was deliberate, but there seems to be a message here about city life versus rural life in the nurturing of children. I'd be surprised if it was deliberate. I think Kim So Yong was more interested in the idea of parents abandoning children for however long and whatever reason -- and to say ""don't do that"". And the best way to do say that was to bring out the reality of the situation -- rather than using the Disney approach.",1277856000,2,2392,4.477064220183486

It was neat seeing the emotions and perspective from Jin and Bin's eyes. The determination to succeed at their quest of getting their mother back to them was touching. I found myself rooting for the girls and hoping that their mother would actually come back for them once they filled the piggy bank. I really enjoyed watching the progress of the piggy bank, and the creative ideas that Jin would come up with to fill it up as fast as they could.

The young actress that plays Jin (Hee Yeon-Kim) did a really good job expressing all the emotions and portraying her character very well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and I would definitely recommend it.",1275955200,,781,4.735294117647059

3898560,5,B002BWP4C4,"Treeless mountain is a much deeper film than what might meet the eye of the casual observer. Behind the touching story of young, six-year-old Jin and her little sister Bin and their quest for a place in this tumultuous world, lies a parable about the devastating effects of globalism.

The first half of the movie shows a continuous plight of deprivation, uncertainty and more than a little heartbreak as Jin and Bin are forced to fend largely for themselves in a world of Western culture-influenced, big city life in Seoul, South Korea. Likewise, the harsh economic realities of this life serves to reek havoc on the lives of their mother, father and ""Big Aunt"", depriving the young girls of the stability and care that is so essential to children in their formative years.

After their ""Big Aunt"" can (or is unwilling to) no longer take care of them, the girls are dropped off at their grandparent's home in the country. While seemingly even more impoverished than their mother and aunt, it is their grandmother who teaches the young girls how to live in a happy, fulfilling, healthy, albeit modest manner. Trully, not since Christ taught on the earth has there been so clear an example set for how mankind ought to live. Should the lifestyle found at the end of this film be meshed with true, Biblical Christianity (as opposed to the kind you see and hear for the most part on the radio and TV), one would know how it is to live according to the will of God. This I am certain of.
Five stars and highly recommended.",1273190400,,1518,4.618518518518519
3898561,5,B002BWP4C4,"It feels as if the movie was set way before the present time, what with the lack of schooling allowed by the various caretakers. I enjoyed the quiet telling of the subtler crimes committed against children in the care of anyone other than their parents. The failure to feed on time, forced laundry, the rejection by any non-disabled friend's mother. Even the down syndrome boy's mom never asked the girls if they had any way of getting back inside their aunt's house. No one noticed they were eating grasshoppers (how is this possible?).. but the director keeps making rewarding cinematic pieces using 'blank canvases'. The grandchildren-halmuni interaction reminded me of ''', another wonderful movie.",1266451200,2,702,5.166666666666667

Initially the little girls are fearful of life at a farm but eventually come to love it.

8362319,3,B002BWP4C4,"<strong>Treeless Mountain</strong> (So-yong Kim, 2008)

Not long ago I reviewed a failed-potential coming-of-age film called <em>Trees Grow Tall and Then They Fall</em> (q.v.). It has a number of thing in common with <em>Treeless Mountain</em> beyond the titles making reference to trees. In many places where the former film gets things wrong, <em>Treeless Mountain</em> gets things right, and yet for the most part it still left me kind of cold; it is possible that there's simply a failing in the attempt to translate the <em>bildungsroman</em> to film, or that neither of these directors, both of whom seemed to be going for a kind of gritty-realism-combined-with-fantasy-escapism, weren;t quite sure how to do what they wanted to do without the fantasy-escapism bit going over into the blatantly-unrealistic realms of, say, <em>The Passion of Darkly Noon</em> (or, more contemporarily, Guillermo del Toro's wonderful coming-of-age fantasies <em>El Espinazo del Diablo</em> and <em>El Laberinto del Fauno</em>), which neither director wanted to do. The end result: two oddly unsatisfying movies, though in every way that matters, <em>Treeless Mountain</em> is the superior of the two.

Plot: Two young girls, Jin and Bin (non-actors Hee-yeon and Song-hee Kim, respectively; Hee-yeon has never acted before, Song-hee is on her second screen appearance here), are left by their cosmopolitan mother (Soo-ah Lee, also in her first screen appearance) with their hard-drinking, working-class aunt, known in the film only as Big Aunt (<em>Jesus Hospital</em>'s Mi-hyang Kim in her feature debut), while she goes off looking for their father after receiving a mysterious letter. Or so she says, anyway; as time goes on and she does not return, her motives become suspect. Ultimately, however, they are irrelevant, as the story focuses on the two girls, who try to make their way in their new, hardscrabble society, returning each day to a barren hillock, the treeless mountain of the title, that overlooks the bus stop where they expect their mother to return.

There is a general problem with movies like this, and there is a problem more specific to this one. The general one is that nothing much really happens in such movies, and so the movie is by definition driven by characters, not plot. The choice of non-actors for most of the roles here was a bold one, but I'm not sure it was the right one given the story. To say this is not, I hope, to take anything away from those actors; they all do a very good job with what they have here, but had they had more experience under their collective belt, I think they could have turned it into a bigger, wider whole than it is. The more specific problem has to do with where Kim, who also wrote the screenplay, ends the story. I can't go into a great amount of detail without spoilers, but I think this movie woud have worked better had it ended either ten minutes before it did (before, without being spoilery, Big Aunt makes the decision that drives the last sequences of the film) or ten minutes after (in which we would have had more time to explore the ramifications of the event in question).

None of this is meant to convey that I didn't like the film. I did, and I do recommend it; just be aware that what you're getting may not exactly be what you think you're getting. (A warning for the animal lovers: there is a sequence in the middle of the film that involves the roasting and eating of grasshoppers a number of times.) ***",1347235200,,3482,4.916666666666667
