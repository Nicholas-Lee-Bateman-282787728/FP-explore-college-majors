1921034,1,B0000D1FGK,"Worst movie I have ever seen.  More about a love triangle than Corregidor, and it wasn't even a good movie about a love triangle, poor acting, stupid, ""VERY STUPID"" plot, Sound quality is awful, watched half of it and had to stop, too hard to understand what the actors are saying.  I love old movies but this one just wasn't worth the trouble to try to watch.",1375833600,,360,4.358208955223881

1921036,2,B0000D1FGK,"This movie should never have been produced, it is that awful. The characters are not too good in their roles. There have been better movies regarding the drama of the conflict there.",1344211200,,182,4.71875
1921037,3,B0000D1FGK,"I realize it's another WWII propaganda grind out, but this one is short on reality, set design and even performance.  Corregidor was a sad disaster for the United States, which had promised to come to the rescue of the Philippines were it to be attacked.  No one ever showed up and a lot of Americans and Filipinos lost their lives trying to hold out for the promised assistance - not that it could have gotten through with the entire country over-run by a massive Japanese onslaught on December 7 (December 8 Manila time).  Again, oddly enough because the Japanese were concerned of the presence of an ""American Army"" in the Philippines.
This movie has mostly cons and doesn't truly represent the country, the suffering, nor the risks Americans and Filipinos took to try to hold out.  This could have been better done.",1305676800,3,819,4.746478873239437
1921038,5,B0000D1FGK,"Vintage WW2 film and with a fascinating discussion about living with the truth in the triangular love theme , especially in the desperate situation the defenders find themselves in. Battle scenes are all paper models, but that does not detract from the classic quality of the film. It is creaky with the 'special effects' but it is so much more 'credible'  and provocative  than the 'Pearl Harbor' done with glossy effects recently.",1204934400,,432,4.986111111111111
1921039,3,B0000D1FGK,The movie quality was not good. Story line is typical of war movies. Very little action.,1200614400,,88,4.5625
1921040,1,B0000D1FGK,"from what little i could make out,this may have been good. i can't say because this is so poor that at times you can't hear a thing and the static and grain are all over the picture. the pits leave it alone and spend your money on something worth while",1147132800,12,252,4.06
1921041,1,B0000D1FGK,"As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the

period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this

example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality

in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old

movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have

found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable

quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer

it for sale is unbeleivable .",1126569600,20,547,3.918181818181818
1921042,2,B0000D1FGK,"Wealthy socialite and, as we later learn, brilliant surgeon Dr. Royce Lee (Elissa Landi) schleps 10,000 miles to the Philippines to rendezvous with, and marry, Dr. Jan Stockman (Otto Krueger), a pleasant (albeit a tad absent minded and disorganized) jungle doctor.  Ominously, CORREGIDOR, a movie named for an island that was the site of a crushing Allied defeat at the hands of the Japanese in 1942, begins its existence as a Somerset Maugham-ish White-Tie Love in the Mango Fields type love story.  Anyway, even though Dr. Royce sent an explanatory letter four months ago, the news of the wedding still comes as a bit of a (not disagreeable) shock to Dr. Jan.

  No sooner are the nuptials joined then a squadron of Japanese planes darken the air and proceed to make hash out of the doctors' jungle home, wiping out the wedding guests in the process.  It's at this point that CORREGIDOR makes it first uneasy transition into action movie mode.  The courageous newlyweds begin the six-hundred mile trek to Manila, hiking through jungle sets and bushy back lots, avoiding the Enemy as best they can, until finally stumbling upon a small unit of American infantrymen.  A half-dozen or so Enemy enter stage right, half-heartedly fire at the Heroes.  The Heroes fire back and saunter off, if that's not too energetic a word for it, and somehow lose their pursuers.  The movie will go on to squander the rest of its miserable existence alternating melodramatic and overly complicated romantic subplots (there's a Dr. Michael at Corregidor...) with static and awkwardly staged action sequences.  About the only consistent quality in this movie is its lack of continuity.

  One saving grace of CORREGIDOR is its willingness, verging on mania, to kill off most of its annoying secondary players.  Unfortunately, it kills off one at the end of act two only to have Dr. Royce hand a baby off to her in the middle of act three.  Not to be outdone by its melodramatic half, the action sequences also shown a strong aversion to keeping things straight.  An Enemy monoplane fighter is fatally shot but it's a biplane that plummets to earth.

 To be fair, the movie was released in spring of 1943, about nine months after the real article surrendered.  That's a short incubation period for a movie, which may explain, if not excuse, some of its more glaring flaws.  This is a pep rally movie, and it gave the viewing public a chance to see one rousing infantry charge (complete with Battle Hymn of the Republic underscoring), the Enemy in disreputable retreat, and a stern scene of American defiance in defeat.

  Still, CORREGIDOR is a bad movie, and whatever emotional charge it once carried dissipated long ago.  The actors are much better than the material, especially Otto Krueger.  I don't recall seeing him in anything else, but he combines the unpretentious amiability of a Jimmy Stewart with the melancholy detachment of a Leslie Howard.  Krueger doesn't have their charisma or star power, but his good performance is wasted in this one.

  Fans of war movies may find CORREGIDOR moderately interesting.",1111363200,25,3099,4.9152215799614645

7999998,1,B0000D1FGK,"The Japanese attack the Philippines with British Spitfires, WW1 bi-planes and what look to me to be American Hudsons.  Surely by 1943 there was better aerial footage available.  I think the director and producers simply didn't care.  Make it cheap.  Make it  quick.  Make a buck.  Poor script, poor love story, miscasting, poor continuity, so so acting, poor special effects, etc., etc.",1499904000,,386,5.129032258064516

8000002,2,B0000D1FGK,"This a B grade movie made during World War II. The acting was ok but the scenes of the Japanese bombing are a mix of film of German aerial  footage, World War I biplane footage, and US training films. The typical stereotypes of the Japanese in WW II were showcased as to their brutality.
 The US soldiers were shown winning often even though greatly outnumbered. Not very historically accurate.",1483920000,,394,4.695652173913044

Oddly the acting isn't that bad.  But the direction is on the order of """"Plan 9 ""  !
The stock footage of aircraft is beyond ridiculous I swear they shot down a World War 1 German Biplane at one point and never knew the Japanese had """"Spitfires""""! One could have a drinking spotting the mistakes in this one.
Enjoy it as a time filler!",1483056000,,369,4.257142857142857
