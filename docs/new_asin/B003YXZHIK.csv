The basic scenario of SOULBOY is a familiar one: boy Joe (Martin Compston) meets unattainable girl (Nichola Burley) and follows her up to a club in Wigan that functions as the center of Northern Soul. There he learns how to dance, but while doing so he gradually discovers that plain lass Mandy (Felicity Jones) has fallen in love with him. After Mandy takes an overdose, Joe realizes his true feelings. Back in the club he has an energetic dance-off with smarmy Alan (Craig Parkinson), and emerges triumphant, thereafter to enjoy love with Mandy.

The grimy, down-at-heel atmosphere of mid-Seventies Stoke-on-Trent is admirably evoked by director Shimmy Marcus, from the poky two-up, two-down houses to the local pub, where everyone pours pints down without ever seeming to enjoy themselves. Joe's mate Russ (Alfie Allen) has a grotesque dance that he calls the ""dying fly,"" but he can only perform that when he is drunk. Sometimes Marcus overdoes the Seventies aura, such as having politician Enoch Powell speaking on one of the car radios; by 1974 he was virtually a spent force in politics, having resigned from the Conservative Party and joined the Ulster Unionists. Some of the cars seem a little antiquated too, dating from a decade earlier.

Once the action shifts to the club, however, the mise-en-scene changes abruptly. Vladimir Trivic's camera admirably captures the phantasmagoria of color, light, bodily movements, sweat and unadulterated fun that characterized the late-night gigs at the club, whose patrons came from all over the country each Saturday night by coach to enjoy the fun. For those of us with longer memories, the set pieces have strong echoes of Saturday NIGHT FEVER (1977) with Joe in the John Travolta role, but that resemblance does not detract from the exuberant staging, in which music and dance combine to create a series of stirring sequences. The final dance-off between Joe and Alan is something to behold: director Marcus uses slow-motion and frequent close-ups to make us aware of the sheer effort involved by the protagonists.

The film ends with a series of of short interviews from people - now very much middle-aged - that frequented the club when it was in its heyday during the mid-Seventies. Their reminiscences capture the atmosphere of excitement and daring that was characteristic of the club; no wonder it was named ""best disco in the world"" later on in the decade, despite its assuming location in a Lancashire industrial town.",1417132800,,2565,5.114558472553699
8409873,4,B003YXZHIK,"This film takes us back to 1974 where we meet Joe (Martin Compston) who lives in Stoke-on -Trent and has to listen to the likes of `Mud' and `The Sweet' and all those other bands that were foisted on us back in the day. Well after seeing a beautiful vision of a lass on the street he finds out she is going to the social Mecca of the North every Saturday night. Where is this British Shangri-la I hear you ask - well it was in Wigan.

This is where the guys n' gals put on their comfy clothes, Oxford baggies and vests for the lads and fetching frocks for the lasses - and then they dance all night to Northern Soul. How do they manage to dance all night I hear you ask again - well they take handfuls of drugs like Dexedrine and any amphetamine they can lay their sweaty paws on - for soul has to be taken seriously but Northern Soul must be taken very seriously.

Now the plot is about as original as a detergent ad. It is boy meets girl, loses girl realises mistake etc. The acting is OK but Compston is always excellent and can `cut a rug' too if this is anything to go by. There is a cardboard cut out bad guy and there are no twists here at all that you can not see before they have made it over the horizon. The best bits are the dancing and the music and that is where this scores and keeps scoring. There are some good scenes like the record shop guy but this is far from a comedy and more of a music indulging drama. If you love Northern Soul then you will want to see this - if you like a bit of nostalgia it works too and look out for some terrible wigs at the beginning - actually I enjoyed this more than I thought - hope you do too.",1401494400,,1647,3.972809667673716
