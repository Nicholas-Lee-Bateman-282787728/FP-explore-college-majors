5739847,4,0310819415,"I bought this study to go with my Sunday School Class, and it hit home, Finding out what is thoughtless and hurtful to another is a blessing to me in many ways. Reading and obeying  God's Word daily is the Key for keeping the mouth in check. This subject is a good subject for the Church.",1429833600,2,288,4.142857142857143

5739849,5,0310819415,"I ordered this DVD,  book and workbook as a result of your recommendations.  It was unknown to me and I had never seen it in the library.  I enjoy it very much.",1426636800,2,160,3.9375
5739850,5,0310819415,"This DVD compliments the book, Keep It Shut. Karen Ehman provides her insight on how to say it, what to say and when to say nothing at all through her experiences and Gods Word and instructions to us. It's truthful, funny and a book I personally will pick back up for refreshers, when I need a reminder!!!",1424649600,4,305,4.368421052631579

8586177,2,0310819415,"I had high hopes for this study when I ordered it.  Karen Ehman tried but fell short.  Some of her comments in the second lesson were inappropriate and I was too embarrassed to show the third video presentation to my Bible Study Group at Church because of an inappropriate story she tells.  I realize that this study was written primarily for a female audience.  However, the women in my Bible Study all agreed that her voice really got on their nerves.  This study was good at defining the problem from a Biblical perspective but offered very little in terms of a Biblical solution.  I had to do a lot of extra work to fill in the gaping deficiencies of this study.  Maybe giving it two stars was too generous.  I can't believe Zondervan agreed to release this.  Pay attention Zondervan because your reputation really took a hit on this one!!!",1500768000,2,844,4.573333333333333
8586178,3,0310819415,"I got this to work through with a friend because we study the Bible together frequently.  For such an important topic, I suppose I was expecting something deeper.  There's nothing ""wrong"" with this study, and it has provoked some excellent conversation with my friend and some really productive examination of conscience.  It also made US want to come up with challenges for ourselves related to speech and holding our tongues, and doing that each week (ex. Go an entire day without cursing in the car, ex. Go an entire week without speaking a single negative word out loud concerning [specific person usually complained over]).  These challenges were something the study made us feel led to assign ourselves and work with...but it would have been nice if the study actually had such prompts FOR the small groups.  It didn't.

The video lessons are good, and Mrs. Ehman is personable, but I really felt (and my friend agreed) that the lessons lack depth.  They're super light lessons revolving around cute and breathlessly delivered personal stories, and I'm finding that is very typical of ""women's"" bible studies.  The Scripture reading is very Proverbs heavy, one verse at a time.  That's not ALL there is, but we both felt it was more of a personal self-help feel than a serious ""time in the Word"" feel.  We had to make up challenges and reading exercises ourselves to really push this into something worthy of six solid weeks.

I feel terrible criticizing a bible study.  The Bible has clearly been a passion for Mrs. Ehman, and she no doubt worked hard writing the study and the book, and God bless her for that.  My friend and I simply didn't get the depth from it that we both feel convicted and convinced that we NEED in our lives following Christ.

The only other ""complaint"" is that the study guide requires reading the ""book"" as well.  So, you have to read the book, watch the DVDs, AND use the study guide.  We used the study guide and DVDs without the book (and maybe that's why the depth we wanted was missing...totally possible), but given the tone and level of the lessons and study guide, I don't have reason to think the book goes any deeper.  We looked at the book and it appears to be more of the same:  personal anecdotes used to highlight individual points.  We got those without needing further elaboration from the lessons and the study guide work.

All of this said, I have to applaud Mrs. Ehman for tackling SUCH an important problem in Christian (and just human in general) behavior.  It's not a topic to be taken lightly.  The damage we can do with our words is talked about at length in the Bible, and it is something we should all be examining and constantly working to improve.  We sin with our words as often as we sin with anything else, and for women who use a lot of words every day, ""Keep In Shut"" will have something useful in it for you.

We don't regret choosing this study, and I don't want to come across as someone just trying to trash this guide.  It wasn't bad.  It just wasn't as good or as thorough as we hoped it would be.",1493769600,3,3070,4.556569343065694
8586179,5,0310819415,"The women's study group I lead has enjoyed this book tremendously!  In fact just today, we finished the 4th session in the book and someone asked if we could just start it over when we complete it.  Every chapter provides insight and useful information that has changed the way we think about how we use our words.  I highly recommend the study.",1488412800,3,345,4.532258064516129
8586180,3,0310819415,Enjoyed the dvd sessions but nothing different from the book,1478304000,2,60,5.1
8586181,2,0310819415,"I purchased this to go with the book and study guide in a group study.  While it's nice to watch a speaker, it was disappointing to watch and realize that the majority of the video is exactly the same content as found in the book. So watching the video is unnecessary. It's better to just read the book and get the study guide",1466899200,4,326,4.174603174603175
