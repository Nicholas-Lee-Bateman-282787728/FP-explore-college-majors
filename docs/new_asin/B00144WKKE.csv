8254342,5,B00144WKKE,"This is a very rare and beautiful Box set of Teresa Teng's most famous concert - 1984 in Taiwan! First, it's really hard to find this early concert of Teresa Teng anymore.  The concert is a fully 2 hours concert -not like others are all cut and trimmed. The picture quality is sharp and clear - that's why the whole concert was put into 2 dvds instead of 1 dvd. You can choose the sound for original concert or you can choose for Karaoke. The third dvd unfortunately- has nothing to do with Teresa Teng, it's a little bit odd. But it's a very very nice, Taiwan mandarin folk song collection - with excellent quality, even comes with 5 different sound selection, you can choose the original singing, karaoke, piano, nature sound, etc... and the videos are all scenic areas from Taiwan I believe. So I quite enjoy this dvd even it's not from Teresa Teng.
Besides the 3 dvds, it comes with a very nice Teresa Teng picture book!! The dvds are all NTSC and region 0 can play on any of my dvd players, not like the Japan dvds I bought can not be played on US dvd player.
It's a little bit pricy for this Box set, but it's totally worth the price!",1293667200,,1140,4.277777777777778
