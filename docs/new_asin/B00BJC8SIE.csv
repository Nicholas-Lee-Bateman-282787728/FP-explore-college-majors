8569523,5,B00BJC8SIE,"The Movie  "" Woman in the window "" was Fantastic!! Well written and well acted. I like my  ""old"" movies in black and white but this was so good, I  forgot that it it was in color.  :)  Betrayed was as I remembered it, a well acted movie that still sickens me, especially to see in 2018 just how real racism still is.",1519603200,,316,3.9523809523809526
