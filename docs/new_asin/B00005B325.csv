7936629,1,B00005B325,Thomas Edison was a well known sadist in the area he lived. He would gather neighbors pets at night and electrocute them. Edison thought it was a huge attraction to take an innocent circus elephant and make a fair of it by electrocuting this precious animal in public. In Edison's lifetime he tortured thousands of animals. Edison is not the hero I was brought up to believe. The true hero Nikola Tesla.,1325980800,3,403,4.611111111111111
7936630,5,B00005B325,"The premise of this story about a runaway who runs into Thomas Edison's lab sounded, well, not that good. After watching it, it was apparent a lot of thought went into this story and it works very well. From what I have read of Edison he is portrayed in this dvd as he really was. Also recommended from the Inventors Specials are Marie Curie More Than Meets the Eye and Newton A Tale of Two Isaacs. The Edison dvd is a favorite of the Inventor Specials because it shows the influence Edison had on this young person's life later as an adult.",1143849600,7,541,4.313725490196078
