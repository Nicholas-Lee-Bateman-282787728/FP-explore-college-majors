8341244,2,B001TH06TI,"I found this DVD to be a great disappointment. The product description on the back reads as follows: ""In August of 1944, the trial began of the men who conspired to assassinate (Hitler). Under orders from Joseph Goebbels, cameras were hidden in the courtroom, and soon thereafter a propaganda film was released to the public. Unfortunately for the Nazis, the film only generated sympathy for the conspirators, who were sentenced to death by the visibly deranged judge. Realizing his miscalculation, Goebbels ordered the film destroyed. But one print has been found."" It was these passages that caused me to purchase the film. I had assumed from this and other remarks on the back that what we were seeing was most or all of the actual propaganda film itself, along with narrative and backstory and commentary to put things in context. What we get instead is a poorly constructed documentary which uses only a few selected excerpts from the propaganda film. Instead of focusing exclusively on the events of July 20, 1944 and the trial, it attempts to cover all the various bungled attempts to assassinate Hitler that took place over the years, and engages in an extremely shallow and clumsy account of the war which seems to have been scripted by the modern-day German government. There are some excellent (and chilling) sequences in which the hapless conspirators are interrogated by the awful bully presiding over the trial, Roland Freisler, but not enough. Weighing in at a light 68 minutes, I'd say this film spends less than half, and perhaps only a third, of its time showing us what happened in that black farce of a courtroom. It isn't enough.

Truth be told, this movie is indicative of a wider problem we encounter when trying to study the filmworks of Nazi Germany. The Federal Republic of Germany has done everything in its power, both within Germany itself and on the international stage, to prevent the sale or distribution, and even the ownership, of movies made during the Third Reich. When old propaganda movies or feature films from the Nazi era are occasionally unearthed, they are used in just this way -- a few selected, approved clips swimming in a sea of finger-wagging narrative. The movies themselves are often not made available for sale, except within documentaries which are themselves carefully scrutinized as to content and form. This is why I consider outlets like PzG, International Historical Films, and Rarefilms and More, along with Amazon itself (for now, anyway) to be extremely valuable research tools. It is possible to get the original Nazi movies in uncut and often subtitled form, rather than have to wade through these clumsy documentaries that are constantly stopping their own narrative to tell us how bad the Nazis are (as if we didn't know!).

All in all I'd say this documentary was a big disappointment and I would have much preferred to simply see the actual propaganda film that Goebbels commissioned. I would have been fine with documentary context to bookend the movie, but not this amateurish counter-propaganda.",1527379200,,3065,4.996086105675147

8341249,2,B001TH06TI,"This could have been a lot better if the filmmaker had just stuck to the subject. Instead they jump around from the trial of the bomb plotters to various other failed assassination attempts to no good purpose. They also seem to feel it necessary to periodically stop and remind everyone how Hitler was a really bad guy before getting back to discussing the trial. The most part though is the narration. The trial films are in German of course, but the filmmaker apparently decided that subtitles were either passe or too expensive and decided to have the narrator either rush through a summary of what was being said, or recite the lines himself. In fact all sources are read by the same person so it really smacks of a very cheap production.

In short a wasted opportunity.",1396396800,2,774,4.649635036496351
8341250,5,B001TH06TI,"When I bought this I thought that it might be boring and so, didn't bother look at it, wondering why I had bought it in the first place. When I got round to reviewing it some months later, I was amazed to find that it was not only a superb presentation of Nazi courtroom drama, with all its banal theatrics, but also a superb historical documentary  of events leading to, including and following the July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler.",1370217600,3,437,4.4625
8341251,4,B001TH06TI,"I would have to believe that anyone who has followed the Hitler curse on history, has seen, at least once, the infamous trial of the men, who were targeted by Hitler and his henchmen, as those who were instrumental in their assassination attempt on Hitler. And although there was, in Hitler's words, some type of, ""Divine Intervention,"" as he so proclaimed, for his not being killed in the explosion, the Trial, with Roland Freisler, is a segment of World History,that is a miscarriage of Justice, in any country. But not in Nazi Germany, where this trial set the precedent for life and the Hitler Court System. The accused were given the only sentence Freisler knew how to give, which ultimately came from Hitler, himself, and that was to be hanged, very slowly, on piano wire, which would cut their heads off, in the most painful and cannibalistic manner, known to man. Freisler was also the President of the Berlin(People's Court) and was also one of the select group who attended the Wannsee Conference, which worked out the plans to exterminate the Jews. Yes, he had a great personality & reputation, in the Nazi Party, but outside of that entity, was a lowly, coward, who learned the meaning of hatred, just as many others did, who joined the Nazi's, who truly had identity problems along with their hatred of just about every ethnic group except,themselves. As individuals, they were all cowards but together, they raped the Earth and its people, in the most brutal, sadistic, barbaric manner, with the most senseless killing of babies, girls, young, middle-aged & old, very old women. When a Jewish baby cried and made too much noise,a Nazi soldier, would grab it by its feet, swing the body until its head hit the steel side of a truck or tank. This was usually done in front of the mother of the child. What was murmured after that was, ""oh well, one less Jew to kill & we save ammunition."" This DVD is fascinating in content, but not for the entire DVD. Yes, there is more footage than what we see on TV, when the Military Channel shows that segment, but for myself, it is just interesting enough to want to own the DVD. I am sure that footage exists, that has more definition and areas of interest, within the court scenes, that we see on the DVD. I am sure that the footage I know exists, could have and should have been included on this DVD. For historical value, I would buy this disc again and again, for it is a part of World History, that no one could afford to forget.",1363219200,,2487,4.57847533632287
8341252,5,B001TH06TI,"I looked at this film, about the trial of the conspirators who knew or were involved in the assassination attempt on at Hitler at his Wolfsschanze, as a teacher previewing to show to high school students and was impressed both as resource for higher level history classes and for someone who would be interested in the history of WWII, Germany and the Third Reich.
First it retains its' authenticity by leaving in the German soundtrack, even if you don't understand German you can hear the tone and invective in the prosecutor's voices. A narrator explains and interprets, but is not intrusive or overwhelming, there are even silences left, rather than like some films where every second has to be filled with talking, music and noise.
The film starts with the trial and then shows the joyous beginnings of the Reich, the marching and cheering crowds. There are news reel photos of  the German leaders, and explanations of who each are.
Previous plots against Hitler are explored, which is highly interesting if you are delving into this subject. I appreciated the inclusions of the plot that was stopped by Chamberlain's visit to Munich and the fact that Rommel was coerced to take poison and then given a hero's funeral, since it would have been too traumatic of a revelation that he was aware of the plot and did nothing to stop it.
The films used are not always of the best quality, but then they cannot be, after the rigors of war.
This film was made in Berlin and includes the browbeating of the excesses of the German government during the war including the holocaust. Comments such as ""the fighting courage of the German troops were misused for a criminal war"". My AP Europe students have always found these kind of insights interesting.
This ends with the ranting of Goebbels, interspersed with burning German cities and the amazing fact that the 9 months between the assassination attempt and the end of the war more people were killed than in the preceding 5 years - a thought to hold if the attempt would have been successful what could have been saved - certainly the moonscape left that is shown of Berlin after the bombing raids. This is a film that can teach anyone who is really interested in history.",1254787200,19,2218,4.731266149870801
