4665440,5,B005EIJHCU,"Excellent quality as usual from Pentrex and the sounds of the various steam whistles and the many scenes of billowing steam emanating from stacks, cylinder cocks, blow-off valves, whistles, etc., made the video extremely entertaining and worthwhile for a nostalgic escape to earlier times.

8468318,3,B005EIJHCU,"The only reason I happened to watch this movie is because my 3 year old son loves trains. This movie kept his attention through out the entire duration of the movie. So he would probably rate it 5 stars if given the chance to. I rated it 3 stars because I found it to be rather boring and repetitive. The movie appeared to replay many scenes shot from slightly different camera angles. The movie is a delight for the kiddos, and informative for grownups, but not entertaining for me.",1454544000,,483,4.438202247191011
