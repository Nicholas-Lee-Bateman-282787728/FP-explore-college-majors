639564,5,6303413870,"Waiting for the Light is one of the most entertaining ""Grade B"" movies ever made, a clever and amusing take on a frenzy that could have taken place during the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Terri Garr plays an out of work single mother who has to vacate her apartment and Shirley MacLaine plays her aunt, a former vaudeville magician.  Out of work and with no where to go, they are saved! The deus ex machina:  Teri Garr inherits from her uncle a run down greasy spoon with living quarters near Orlando.  Bored to death away from the big city, Shirley MacLaine flings a sheet over their neighbor's tree and puts a smoke pot under it.  Their eccentric neighbor thinks he has seen the face of Jesus. Crowds of people, thinking the world is coming to an end, descend on the greasy spoon to see the sheet on the tree. A big time reporter catches on to Shirley MacLaine but sticks around to see how things unfurl.",1291680000,,900,4.397590361445783
639565,4,6303413870,This is the Shirley MacLaine that all have grown to love and respect.  Extremely delightful film.,1285891200,,97,5.0625
639566,4,6303413870,"Our family enjoyed this film. It's not ground breaking in any way, but these enjoyable actors make it worth the time. Shirly MacLaine is fun to watch as a crazy Aunt. Teri Garr is good, but the script doesn't tap into her talents like it could have.",1263168000,,249,4.319148936170213
639567,5,6303413870,We have been watching this movie at least once a year for 13 years.  It was especially good when everybody in the family was bummed out or just needed to lighten up a bit.,1182902400,,171,4.029411764705882

639594,4,6303413870,"If you're a Shirley MacLaine fan, you'll like it.  It's a story about a unique family that pretty much rolls with each others' eccentricities.  I like to see that.  They stick together, no matter what, without condemnation and rejection.  Shirley's character was played as only Shirley can, with that ""this is who I am, and if you don't like it, it's your problem"" attitude.  I like that.  We all need to accept each other the way they are, instead of always trying to change them.  There's a good lesson in this, also a bit of a miracle aspect that seems to change a whole towns attitude.  We can all use the hope of a miracle.  I'm happy to have this in my collection.",1389139200,,670,4.382113821138211

639596,4,6303413870,"the acting is very good.  it is funny, but keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Very much liked the Spiritual content.",1379289600,,118,4.086956521739131
639597,5,6303413870,This is a really fantastic film ! The cast works well off each other and the story line was not only entertaining but makes you think a little. (And not in a bad way lol ) Its one that your whole family will enjoy!,1377648000,,214,3.8863636363636362
639598,5,6303413870,This movie has a good cast and is very humorous.  It should be better known than it is.  I think most folks would enjoy it.,1370995200,,123,3.88
639599,5,6303413870,"I will be watching the movie when it arrives.  There is a good chance i've seen it before and just don't remember.  I have seen a lot of movies with Teri Garr and Shirley McClaine in them and loved them. Always funny!  I am buying the video for an elderly couple I know through classic car cruises. Their '56 Dodge is in the movie somewhere, kind of like an extra in cardom. Which for us car nuts is almost as good as having a starring role. Even for our friends who's cars are in even a commercial. lol  I never thought to ask them if they had the movie or not so am getting one for them as a surprise and one for myself.  The car is beautiful, still has the old plastic seat covers on it that were on it new even. It was her first car. Her husband's first was a 1930? Ford and his work truck as a tv radio repair man and their every day driver is a 1940 chevy panel truck. I estimate they are both about 80 yrs old and the nicest couple. These are the only cars they have owned and still drive, the work truck he bought in 1959 i think he said. Hopefully they don't have the movie but if they do they will have an extra copy when i see them when the sun comes out again here in the NW!  I will have to come back after i see the movie and let you know how it was! I'll be looking for the Dodge for sure!",1356739200,,1304,3.865168539325843
639600,5,6303413870,"This is a film you have to see several times. It is not only a comedy, it's loaded with themes that impact one's universal views, globally and spiritually. I'm sure this is why Shirley took the role. (Being bombed at the end of the world is a fear many prophesies provoke... While in the meantime - life is happening all around us, everywhere. And even ghosts come back to haunt us! It's tough being human!)

Shirley plays the kooky aunt who exasperates everyone! Yet she seems to be the only one who has her finger on what's really happening. She has an absurd connection to the dramas of life (all the while wearing her appalling, revealing sexy outfits for an ""older"" woman)! The kids totally trust her. They turn to her while their mother is absorbed with making ends meet. Auntie knows that much of life is an illusion. As the rest of the world goes about preparing for the ""bomb"" and a potential war with Cuba, the children trust their aunt. The Rapture has not come, just yet. What is nice about this story is that it gives you a little hope in the irony of being human.",1336262400,,1077,4.4120603015075375

7845778,5,6303413870,"""Waiting For The Light"" begins with the premise that no one is perfect- no man, woman, child; old or young-no one! But change is possible for anyone open to it and this is accomplished without preaching or lectures. How we as individuals arrive at that juncture is uniquely are own; no one solution fits all.

This is a very sweet film which slyly gets a heavy message across while remaining fun & funny!

Highly recommended.",1439424000,,425,4.653333333333333
7845779,5,6303413870,"A great classic about a single mother during the Cuban Missile Crisis trying to raise three children, her son, her daughter and her eccentric aunt.  Shirley MacClaine shines all throughout this offbeat yet poignant film that has yet to receive the recognition it so richly deserves.",1435449600,,282,5.130434782608695

7845781,4,6303413870,"This movie is a little hard to find, but if you can, and if you like Shirley MacLaine, this is a good one. It probably won't mean much to anyone under 55, as it takes place during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Some of us still remember the ""duck and cover"" routines. This is a good laugh at the period, thanks to Terri Garr and Shirley MacLaine.",1412553600,,341,4.181818181818182
