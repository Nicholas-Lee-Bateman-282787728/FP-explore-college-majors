3977999,4,B002S3Y1JS,"I just bought 'Kendra' and it is great! Spent all of yesterday watching and loving every fun-loving minute. I especially enjoyed the 'bonus' episode when Bridget Marquardt came to dinner and sort of 'interviewed' Hank and Kendra. That episode was not only a great re-cap episode but also had a lot of deleted scenes and behind the scenes info. Very nice. The only reason I am not giving 'Kendra' 5 stars is because the bonus episode is the only bonus, there is no commentary like on the GND dvds. I was not really that surprised though, Kendra was usually pretty vocal about not liking to do the commentary.",1262736000,5,607,4.62962962962963
3978000,5,B002S3Y1JS,Whats not to like about this. It's just a sweet young couple having some fun. Kendra seems very sweet and kind. Hank seems like a great husband. Now both of them are going to be great parents. I can't wait for the next season to come out.,1262563200,4,238,4.085106382978723
3978001,5,B002S3Y1JS,"Well, since the new Girls Next Door totally sucks and they all look like ugly men, thank God, Kendra has her own show! It's so funny how she lives in Indiana (my state) and likes it. I support any of the former,awesome, and the original Girls Next Door! :)",1262390400,14,256,4.244897959183674
3978002,5,B002S3Y1JS,"Short and simple if you like ""The Girls Next Door."" You will love this show. I watched this on E! with my wife and we both enjoyed it. Hilarious first season, what will Kendra get into next? I definitely recommend this!",1262390400,8,219,4.365853658536586
3978003,1,B002S3Y1JS,Disc Two would not work at all. We tried multiple DVD players to no avail. As this item was a gift pre-ordered months ahead of time the return date was past. My daughter was very disappointed...,1381449600,,194,4.416666666666667
3978004,5,B002S3Y1JS,Very good and entertaining! It's nice to see the next chapter in this funny woman's life. Can't wait to get the next season!,1374364800,,124,4.434782608695652
3978005,4,B002S3Y1JS,"After five years of being one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends she is out on her own, she has her own personal mansion.  I wonder if Hef got it for her.

Kendra is engaged to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2007-Playoff-NFL-PlayoffsFootball-75-Hank-Baskett-Philadelphia-Eagles-Premium-Trading-Card-in-Protective-Display-Case/dp/B00A6FP6BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2007 Playoff NFL PlayoffsFootball # 75 Hank Baskett - Philadelphia Eagles - Premium Trading Card in Protective Display Case</a>.

She has never shopped for food she says, she goes to the store with her friend Brittany and they spend $400 on food.  Kendra opts to ride the handicapped cart.

Her first piece of furniture is a stripper pole. Her brother and mom come to visit. Holly appears briefly, she has a housewarming party.  Bridget attends and Hef is there. We see how soon the house is messy and she bares some skin.

She gets Hank at the airport, he seems like a good guy. He goes along with all her craziness.

Episode 2 they go to a charity basketball game in Tampa. They go and visit his parent is NM and visit a dairy farm along the way, weird.  They road trip To Roswell and the Grand Canyon, she brushes her teeth in the car. (Odd)

An emotional scene when she jumps into her pool to save her dog when it jumps in, she thinks it can not swim, she is nearly in tears. Though she has been in the house a brief amount of time she decides to have a garage sale, the police show up!  Along the way we meet her odd friends. Rapper Too Short visits to record an album, he brings his own barber. Hank is baffled, he cleans the house when the girls go to Las Vegas. They do indoor sky diving and Kendra opts to go topless, amazing to see.  Then later they are in the pool.

Disk 2 she goes to get bush wacked, she says she has a bush but we have seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girls-Next-Door-Season-Two/dp/B000NNK4DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girls Next Door: Season Two</a>&nbsp;that she is shaved. They shop for a wedding dress and they take Hank's parents to the Playboy Mansion as they will marry there. It is like she is an American Princess. She has people over for dinner and prepares a meal.

She drives to San Diego to see her mom and attend a suprise bridal shower, sshe tells them she is prego and her mom is mad.  After 3 weeks they make up. She calls Hef to tell him. They receive their wedding invitations and go for an ultra sound, she is due 12-25.

Bachelorette party and wedding rehersal, we finally get to hear her mom laugh like Kendra does. Kendra has such a pretty laugh.

The weddding is very nice.

There is an additional feature called 'Kepping it Real' that is pictures of the honeymoon and Brigette gets t ouse her interview skills to rehash the first season, with clips. After getting prego and married she seems different. Interesting, engaging.",1368403200,,2945,5.012320328542095
3978006,5,B002S3Y1JS,No one is buying this for great story lines or its educational value... but Kendra is cute and goofy and that's worth it to me.,1358208000,,127,4.12
3978007,5,B002S3Y1JS,I really like Kendra and Hank. They are one couple that seems happy and I hope they make it through all the Hollywood stuff.  They are very honest in the show. I also really like Kendra's family- her Mom and Grandma are both very funny.,1351728000,,236,4.2444444444444445

3978011,5,B002S3Y1JS,"Bought this for my wife since she is a fan of the original Girls Next Door and had a particular fondness for Kendra. She never saw the show since we don't have cable but fell in love quick. She watched the entire season the night we got it. Personally, I didn't really pay too much attention so I can't go into details too much, but this is probably my wife's new favorite show.",1302912000,,378,4.191780821917808
3978012,1,B002S3Y1JS,hank is a fool for marrying kendra she's a former ex prostitute who did orgies with her sugardaddy hugh hefner plus on some old pimp chit kendra took hank to meet her ex who does that betcha iceberg slim is laughing at hank right now then she invited too short to her house why hank is a fool looks like kendra is still up to her tricks plus she's bisexual isn't that why hank married her this is why their marriage is about to be over.,1301529600,,436,4.0813953488372094

3978014,5,B002S3Y1JS,"I have watched ""Kendra: The Complete First Season"" multiple times over the past year while working out on the tredmil at home. This and ""The Girls Next Door"" are the only two TV shows I can build up a sweat to and be so engrossed in to the point of laughing, smiling and feeling abosulte Love and respect for Kendra, Hank, Holly, Bridgette and Hef. It is awesome seeing Kendra grow up in the mansion and then star in her own series where she continues being her beautiful self, inside and out by ""keeping it real"". She has come so far! She is forever the Loving friend and wife, and now mother! I can't wait for Season 2 to come out. I wish Kendra, Hank and their little family the very BEST! I hope to one day have the Loving husband and family that Kendra does. It is my opinion that anyone who dislikes Kendra is a HATER!",1293494400,,824,4.2215189873417724
3978015,5,B002S3Y1JS,"I absolutly loved this! And I liked it even better having read Kendra's memior along with it. In this season, we really get to see Kendra and Hank as a couple, not just a former face of Playboy or as a footbal player. We get to see Kendra become a more domesticated woman, learning to shop and cook on her own,which is a great adventure for some.

All in all, if you loved The Girls Next Door, and you were a huge Kendra fan, this is a must have, you'll be laughing, crying or even cheering Kendra along as you enjoy her struggle to become a wife and a soon to be mom.",1288137600,,568,4.0265486725663715
3978016,5,B002S3Y1JS,"I think they are great together and love how she has matured since leaving the playboy mansion. I hope they can make it work and get through ""the tape"" situation.",1275609600,3,162,4.433333333333334

3978018,5,B002S3Y1JS,I watched Kendra's season on TV first and it is soo much better on the DVD! I absolutely love it! The DVD is also not edited so it shows nudity and doesn't beep out cuss words. I would highly recommend it!!,1265328000,16,206,4.048780487804878
3978019,4,B002S3Y1JS,"Since I am not a Playboy fan so I was a late bloomer to start watching ""The Girls Next Door"" on E!
I did not start watching until the winter of 2009  I like Bridget & Holly

Grew to like Kendra because I watched her season 1

OF COURSE, A LOT OF IT IS STAGED FOR TV.

Good to see the REAL TGND together in some episodes.

We know the timing of the release for the premiere of season 2 in March 2010, after the hour show with the birth of Hank the 4th.

I like Hank, he seems like a nice guy, so is the rest of his family.

Has a flyer inside for the promotion of season 2

NO extras, claiming the hour episode where Bridget comes to the house to speak about what has been going on with Kendra & Hank  ALL staged for TV but good to see

No commentary on this set, that was the best part of TGND DVD sets

And, we TGND fans can skip the NEW & A TOTAL LET DOWN TGND  Especially since the twins, looking only for career opportunities moved out

And, the theme song  Kendra likes it & it is hers but I hate it  Have to hit mute or just skip it",1264464000,3,1038,3.7850467289719627
3978020,4,B002S3Y1JS,"If you are checking this out, you probably loved the Girls Next Door. Kendra is the youngest of the blond threesome, and Kendra is the first season of the reality show about her life - but you probably already knew that.

The show takes us through Kendra moving into her new home, moving in with her fiance, breaking the news of her pregnancy to an unhappy mother and the challenges and humor of life after the Playboy Mansion.

If you liked the Girls Next Door you will like this. It has cameo's of Bridget and Holly and it is full of those situations, girls and experiences that made the Girls Next Door so much fun. For me, the hole left by Holly and Bridget is noticeable but the show manages to be fun without them.

I wish that this DVD release had more special features - in a world where you can download any TV show, there needs to be motivation to actually purchase the DVD - it is uncensored and includes the extra re-cap episode, but little else by way of features.",1264377600,2,977,4.327868852459017
3978021,5,B002S3Y1JS,"I thought this season was great, but i didn't know most of her pregnancy is really in season two, can't wait for season two to come out!!!I loOoved watching the wedding though ' ' ' ' !!!!",1263427200,2,188,4.108108108108108
3978022,4,B002S3Y1JS,"Kendra is great and the DVD's have everything from the first season... perhaps too much. These DVD's are not suitable for kids, definitely not without adult supervision. The show on DVD is UNCENSORED, so every word bleeped on TV can be heard on the DVD's, and everything blurred or pixelated on TV is totally visible on the DVD's. That aside, the show is great. Kendra is funny, pretty and likeable. Kendra and Hank make a great couple. The fact the episodes on DVD are uncensored should've been disclosed though.",1263168000,14,513,4.775280898876405
