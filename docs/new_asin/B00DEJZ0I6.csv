The programmes introduce local and regional features or topics that often lead one to say""we saw that area/town/river/what ever, but didn't realise what else was going on-we need to go back there if we have the chance"".",1518307200,,281,5.2444444444444445
8592515,5,B00DEJZ0I6,"What a fabulous series! When it was recommended to me, I expected a traditional travel show that couldn't sustain interest for 17 let alone 170 episodes. Besides, Ive been to the UK many times and figured that theres not a lot new to see. Boy was I wrong.  For one thing, this show has an actual purpose and theme, and an inspiring one at that: The greatness of the Industrial Revolution and the Victorians who brought it about. The ever-enthusiastic (but not overly-enthusiastic) Portillo exclaims about the ingenuity of man and shows us how the Victorians used science, technology and industry to change the face not only of England but of the world, creating jobs and wealth throughout society. Using an 1860 railroad-based travel guide, he takes us throughout the UK, finding fascinating examples of Victorian accomplishments in cities and in tiny villages that I didn't know existed.  Ive been continually impressed by how that little island changed the world in the 19th century, demonstrating how much human beings can accomplish if left relatively free to turn their ideas into reality.",1511481600,,1094,5.038674033149171
