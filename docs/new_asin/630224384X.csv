7822674,4,630224384X,"Ghita Norby is close to being my favorite actress from the Danish theater including film, having seen her and Henning Moritzen on stage some years back in Copenhagen. They both give excellent performances here of a difficult script. I am not sure that the characters they play in this movie are people I would become fast friends with, but as they are, they are marvelously inhabited by the actors. The pace of the film can be a tad slow and repetitive but stay with the actors. They are worth it.",1405728000,,497,4.533333333333333

7822676,5,630224384X,"Memories of a Marriage (based on Martha Christensen's best-selling novel, Dansen med Regitze) is a wonderful, moving and superbly acted film featuring what may be the greatest on-screen performance by the luminous Ghita Nrby, one of Denmark's finest actresses (and a lovely person--I met her once in Seattle). The film traces the relationship between Regitze and her husband, Karl-Aage; in the present, Regitze has received devastating news about her health. Thus, much of the film is a flashback to the ups and downs of their marriage, which began when they first met under the Occupation in World War II. Regitze is a strong-willed young woman, whereas Karl-Aage seems more weak and pliable. Still, they love each other and complement. The film film slowly discloses Regitze's carpe-diem approach to life, her own very life force. This is a not a visually stunning film (though there are some lovely touches); it is first and foremost a character study. Forget Nrby's performance (albeit powerful) in the tedious _Hamsun_ and try to get a copy of this haunting film. I showed it to a class once, and most were in tears at the end--yet, in classic Scandinavian fashion, there wasn't one emotionally cheap or maudlin scene in the film.",973468800,9,1235,5.029268292682927
