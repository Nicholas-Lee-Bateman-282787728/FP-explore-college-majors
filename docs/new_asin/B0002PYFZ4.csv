2113323,5,B0002PYFZ4,"I bought this because 1) it's Veggie Tales, and my daughter loves them, and 2) it has music from the Mikado in it. I love when they incorporate familiar music and themes and even parody them (like the ""Pirates of Penzance"" parody in ""Lyle, the Kindly Viking"").

But my favorite part of this DVD is BY FAR the story of St. Patrick. It's hilarious! And it's the only part of the DVD that my daughter gives her full attention to (she's 16 months). You'll laugh yourself silly. 4 of my 5 stars go for the St. Patrick part of this DVD.

The Sumo part parodies the Rocky movies with the music of the Mikado. Perseverance, the lesson here, is a hard concept to teach to kids, but the fact that the stories (from the silent 3 Stooges-like film on through) are so varied and contain adult concepts and references will make this a favorite for everyone from young to old. This one's a keeper.",1101427200,4,882,4.371951219512195
2113324,4,B0002PYFZ4,"My wife and I eagerly anticipated getting this for our daughter, who does indeed love her Veggie Tales. Contrary to other certain reviews, this wasn't bad at all, but it will go over the heads of some kids. My wife and I were able to laugh most of the way throughout the whole thing.

This isn't the first episode where the message could have at one point gone over the head of a kid or 2. In ""Lyle, the Kindly Viking"" they put Archibald Asparagus and the French peas as host and co-hosts, yet it was easier to get the message.

But it starts out with Bob getting a phone call from Larry, who is to help with a toy rally, gets lost, gets upset and bent out of shape, and is frankly ready to throw in the towel because it is getting too tough. The whole show is all about persevering, or as Bob tells Larry, ""To keep on keepin' on!"" It has a silent version of the 3 Stooges, but then gets complicated to some kids. They go on to tell about St. Patrick, and that's when my daughter went on to doing something else for 1 reason. There was no Bob or Larry at all, and it did go way, WAY over her head. But then you get to the main event! It focused on the Italian Scallion vs. Apollo Gourd. I really loved the way that Pa Grape made a good Mickey-like character, yet without all the bad language. The Italian Scallion is known for not finishing what he starts, and he wants to quit when the pressure is on once his big fight with Apollo. So while over the heads of some, it is a message for all to see, yet it might appeal to an older kid crowd.

Now while other people may have their um, big ideas, so-to-speak, let's give some credit where credit is due. Because while some of us never finish what we start, this does go a long way to deliver a lesson worth far more than riches, and that's what counts. Very encouraging for everyone! Also a great silly song with ""School House Polka""!",1101254400,6,1883,4.153424657534247
2113325,5,B0002PYFZ4,"I bought this DVD for my niece for her baptism gift, and its the best thing i could have gotten her.  She LOVES it!!  My sister said it is the only thing that has kept her attention for over a half hour...and that is a long time for a baby who is now only 6 months.  My sister now has time to do a little work from home, and she feels safe letting her watch an educational program.  TV isn't the best thing for babies, but this is one thing my sister doesn't mind letting her watch.  Plus we are Christian and want my niece to learn about God, so this is a great way.  And i can't forget to mention how much sacred free time it gives my sister.  We are now looking into buying the whole collection as she gets older.  This really is a great gift for any occasion!  Extremely happy with my purchase!",1098748800,5,798,4.031847133757962
2113326,2,B0002PYFZ4,"This video's primary purpose was to parody Rocky and other such films, and the lesson is very much secondary. I agree that Rocky and wrestling is not fit Christian material for children, nor did I like the way Larry turned his accordion solo into a quasi-rock-star-guitar-solo. St. Patrick segment was way too much like South Park to be in a Christian video, and, though I am Christian, I wasn't comfortable with the portrayal of pagans.

Big Idea Productions no longer exists. Big Idea Inc., which is owned by Classic Media, is producing the videos. Phil Vischer is not employed by Classic Media, but has worked a deal to provide one script a year and give notes on up to 2 scripts per year, as well as doing the voices. You can find more information on Phil's website: [...]

My 2 year old daughter loves the music and enjoys watching it, but I agree with everyone who feels this was not up to snuff.

I recommend avoiding the next release, ""The Princess and the Pie War,"" if you didn't like this one. Phil was not involved with this one except in that he and Lisa both recommended they throw out the script and start over, which they did not.

Phil has a script in the works and we should see it in 2005 and it should be awesome. Read about it on his website.",1097020800,23,1262,4.4034334763948495
2113327,1,B0002PYFZ4,"They defined paganism as people that worshipped ""sticks and pond scum."" I found this hateful and inappropriate. It was clearly derogatory and meant to portray non-Christians as sub-human and insane. They could have used a historically accurate depiction of, say, druids (since it was in Celtic areas) and paganism rather than belittle and make fun of beliefs that differ from their own.

I have purchased every Veggie Tales episode released, and have never been offended...until this. Smacks of intolerance and ignorance.

Other than that, not one of the better releases at all.",1096934400,13,578,5.271739130434782
2113328,1,B0002PYFZ4,"Sumo of the Opera is terrible. It's not up to the standard of Veggie Tales and should be marketed under another name. My 4-year-old is the world's expert on VeggieTales and we own them all, so we were eagerly anticipating the release of this latest show.

Everything about it is disappointing. It seems to be a hastily cobbled-together collection of random, not-very-good ideas. First of all, professional wrestling is not my idea of a good subject for a children's Christian video. Of course, there are virtually no Christian references, so maybe that doesn't matter. As for opera, I don't get the connection at all. Except for the music, which was the biggest letdown of all. I'm a huge fan of Kurt Heinicke's brilliant scores, with their wide-ranging musical styles and myriad of clever musical references, so I was shocked by how bad the music is in this show. The whole wrestling segment is a rip-off of Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado, with bad replacement lyrics that sound like a summer camp skit. This is especially surprising since there have been excellent takeoffs on G&S in several previous VeggieTales movies, with original material and orchestration.  The other music in the show is anonymous rock-and-roll for the ""Rocky"" spoof, and a clumsy Schoolhouse Rock-type Silly Song. Even the recording levels are spotty. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the St. Patrick flannelgraph section didn't fit the rest of the show. It was stupid from start to finish. Although at least the music, a misty celtic-sounding arrangement of Be Thou My Vision, was OK.  And the silent movie segment was kind of cute - I guess because it was someone else's good idea.

Phil Vischer's influence, taste and creativity were obviously missing from this show, even though he was used for voice talent. Having read that it's a new company, I'm slightly less puzzled, but no less disgusted. Their priorities are obviously completely opposite from the old team's. If you love VeggieTales, do yourself a favor and pass this one up.",1096329600,17,2025,4.964601769911504
2113329,5,B0002PYFZ4,"The latest episode of everyone's favorite vegetables is packed full.

First up is ""Going Up,"" a ""silent"" film starring the three Veggie Stooges working to deliver a very heavy piano up a very tall flight of stairs.

Next up is our silly song, the hilarious ""School House Polka.""  Where do they get these great ideas?

Then comes a new segment.  ""Lufti's Fanciful Flanographs"" features the story of St. Patrick.  I found this retelling rather funny myself.

Finally comes the title feature.  Larry takes the main role of The Italian Scallion, a sumo wrestler who never takes anything seriously.  Will he follow through when he challenges Apollo Gourd to a championship match?

All this is held together by Bob trying to convince Larry, via phone, to go to the charity event he's supposed to be at.

While the last couple of episodes have been great, they've had fewer laugh out loud moments in them do to the nature of the stories they were telling.  This episode is all out laughs.  I loved every segment.  The last one had plenty of references adults will appreciate as it spoofs underdog sports movies.  Throughout the show, the theme is still clear - perseverance is rewarded by God.

As always, anyone looking for more won't be disappointed by the DVD.  For adult fans, they've got behind the scenes documentaries and an audio commentary.  Kids will enjoy the trivia game, maze, and craft ideas.  And, as always, picture and sound are top notch.

It seems my love of VeggieTales grows with every episode I see.  This is no exception.  If you love these shows, be sure to add this one to your collection.",1095292800,40,1607,4.725631768953068
2113330,4,B0002PYFZ4,"Despite the fact that Veggies Tales and Big Idea are now owned by a larger company, the creativity and Biblical messages haven't stopped coming. THE SUMO OF THE OPERA is the latest episode to be released in the Veggie Tales series.

The entire episode revolves around a message of perseverance.  Larry isn't on the show because he's supposed to be delivering some toys to some kids. However, he's gotten lost and is about ready to give up when he calls Bob asking for help.  What follows are several films aimed at trying to keep Larry from giving up with what he set out to do.

The first short in the episode is a ""silent"" film called ""Going Up"".  The short film is kind of a tribute to the Three Stooges and involves a trio of vegetables (who look like the Stooges) trying to deliver a piano up a mountain of stairs. The film is introduced by a hand-puppet in the shape of a cucumber which is operated by Khalil.

The second short on the tape is the usual Silly Songs with Larry.  This one is entitled ""Schoolhouse Polka"" and has Larry singing about homophones.  The song is rather short, but it is original and reminiscent of the Silly Songs from the original Veggie Tales episodes.

A third feature on the tape is ""St. Patrick's Day"" which tells the history of St. Patrick. The story is illustrated with images that look like pictographs, but pictographs which move 3-Dimensionally. The story is quite informative and educational. However, I have no idea why it's on this episode since St. Patrick's Day isn't until March and the video was released at the end of August.

The final installment on the episode is ""The Sumo of the Opera"".  ""The Sumo of the Opera"" can best be described as a tribute to Rocky, interspersed with Oriental dressed vegetables who sing songs to the tunes of Gilbert and Sullivan. Quirky, yes. But it works and provides enough vibrant colors and short tunes to keep even the youngest children involved.

Overall, SUMO OF THE OPERA is a great Veggie Tales. There's a lot crammed in one tape, but most people like their veggies plump.",1094601600,19,2062,4.603825136612022
2113331,5,B0002PYFZ4,"This VeggieTales release is another winner.  With four excellent segments, this show has enough variety to win over lots of different tastes.

""Going Up"" is a spoof of Laurel and Hardy mixed with The Three Stooges, and while this has some dialogue (not in the actual story, but in the special dialogue cards that go with it), the original ""unrestored"" version that was going to be part of the show before it was changed is included as a bonus DVD feature.

""Schoolhouse Polka"" is a pretty good Silly Song, though not as good as some other recent greats like ""Sport Utility Vehicle"" and ""Belly Button.""  It's also kind of short.  A good segment, nonetheless.

""St. Patrick's Day"" tells the story of Saint Patrick in a mix of 2-D and 3-D animation, within the context of a flannelgraph.  It's a great story on church history and it's very funny to boot.

The main segment, ""Sumo of the Opera,"" is wonderful with a great color palette, excellent animation, and a good story.  This one also has a good score.

As usual there is a Bible verse at the end, but a surprise happens to QWERTY.  Hopefully he'll be repaired by next show.

The DVD features are as to be expected from Big Idea top notch, including Easter Eggs and the standard behind-the-scenes interviews.  There are previews for two upcoming shows, ""The Princess and the Pie War"" (January 2005) and ""Minnesota Cuke"" (May 2005), as well as a progression reel and art gallery.  My favorite feature is always the audio commentary, and David Pitts and Mike Nawrocki (who also did the commentary on ""A Snoodle's Tale"") do a great job with the audio commentary on this DVD.  For the St. Patrick's Day segment, Mr. Nawrocki is joined by Brian K. Roberts, who animated the entire segment.  After the segment is done David Pitts come back and he and Mr. Nawrocki finish the rest of the commentary.

One minor concern -- Phil Vischer is almost nowhere to be found on this DVD.  Aside from voicing Bob, Jerry Gourd, Pa Grape, and his other usuals, and singing in the Japanese vegetable choir, he seems to have had little to do with this episode, and he's not in any of the DVD features either.  Hopefully he will be more involved in the upcoming episodes.

Overall a great episode and a great DVD -- surely another classic for everybody's VeggieTales library.",1093824000,13,2304,4.655940594059406

While I understand that Veggie Tales often contains good-natured parody, I believe that this could have been done while still respecting or at least giving a somewhat accurate portrayal of the wordlview St. Patrick encountered. Actively mocking paganism added nothing to the plot and will likely drive away any non-Christian viewers that could still have appreciated and benefited from the main message.

I'm in my mid-50s and very much enjoy animation of all ilks. ""Veggie Tales"" may be aimed at kids to get the Christian message to them, but at least they do it in a gentle way and don't ram it down our throats.

  We're Jewish, but I have never had a problem with any of the DVDs, other than this one.  They always show content that I can be proud of my kids learning - just not this time.

Not only do you have the classic battles between Archibald and Larry as to whether there is too much silliness in the shows (which there can never be) but each episode contains a new silly song which I guarantee will grow to be priceless. I haven't seen Esther or King George, but I'm sure they are simple awesome. Rack, Shack, and Benny is the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the Bible. Only instead of being thrown into the fire because they would not bow down to the King's statue, they work in a chocolate factory and won't bow to the giant bunny or sing ""The Bunny Song."" Josh and the Giant Wall is really funny because the French peas are launching purple slushies at the Isralites as they walk around the wall of Jerico; it's just classic. And last but not least, Dave and the Giant Pickle has so many little funny things throughout the movie that just make you laugh, such as the fact that Dave's sheep tip over. It may not seem funny now, but once you watch the movie and see it in context, it will. Two wonderful silly songs are featured in these episodes: ""Love My Lips"" and ""Song of the Cebu.""

One of the terrific things about Veggie Tales is they pack a good message and are entertaining to kids, while still appealing to adults with their parodies and/or more mature content (ie., references to Shakespeare or Gilbert and Sullivan, etc). In 'Sumo' they forgot about the kids.

The featurettes are fun as usual, but when the title feature (Sumo) comes on, my kids get bored and find something else to do. And why wouldn't they? At six years old, my daughter doesn't understand references to Rocky, Mr T., or linguistic jokes that require at least highschool-level English to appreciate. (Haikus, etc.) Some of the plot points are just weird. (Tiger bike?) This one doesn't even have any memorable songs for kids to sing along with. To top it all off, the DVD is done in a non-mono format, meaning that since I don't have a stereo TV, I can only hear half the conversation on between-skit narration. To find out what Larry's saying, I have to turn on the subtitles!

The Silly Song and St. Patrick sketch are the only really creative bits on this vid. The rest of it, sadly, makes me think Mike Nawrocki must have had a contract deadline to rush this one to market.",1132876800,4,1356,4.549180327868853

My daughter loves the Heroes of the Bible tales, so I bought this to add to her collection.  Hopefully she will like it when she's a bit older.

The short story of St. Patrick gave me a good chuckle.  The Veggie Stooges were... eh... less than desirable.  The Larry Stooge (not played by Larry) creeped me out.  Looked like Zeus lightening bolts sticking out of his head.

I enjoyed it way better than a Snoodles tale, Wonderful World of Autotainment, or Duke and the Pie War.  OK, so maybe the St. Patrick segment wasn't completely theologically or historically accurate...come on!  Honestly, can preschoolers understand all the facets of paganism?  Druids did focus their worship on nature, so it wasn't completely off base.  I thought it did a great job of introducing kids to an historical figure who WAS a Christian.  In light of the fact that hardly anyone today understands March 17 more than wearing green and drinking beer, this is a good thing.  Let's get off the Catholic bashing and dismissing this video as corporate junk.  And...the St. Patrick segment looked South Park-esque?  IT'S A FLANNELGRAPH!!! Of course it's going to look different.  Anyone who grew up going to Sunday School and learning from flannelgraphs would have a blast watching this.  All in all, there is still truth to be learned here, and it's done in a very entertaining way.

My 3-year old loved it even though he has yet to experience the ecstacy of the first 2 Rocky movies (and the utter agony of the others...)

I want to mainly focus on the seemingly controversial ""St. Patrick"" flannelgraph segment. I'm a Catholic and I see nothing at all irreverent about the piece. It's humorous, yes, but there are many parts of the story of St. Patrick which strike one as odd, possibly fanciful, possibly miraculous, and humor is not out of place in the telling of the story. It is certainly not inaccurate in the demonstration that many pagans of the Emerald Isle dropped their religion in favor of Christianity almost as immediately as the cartoon characters drop their tree branches. This is something which is especially necessary for children to learn since they will be pummeled with the nonsense in schools and universities that the Church relentlessly persecuted pagans as a regular principle and forced them to convert.",1116374400,6,1101,4.825396825396825

The feature film, ""Sumo of the Opera,"" is an excellent story to tie in the message that God wants us to perservere.  I can't think of a better way to teach this big word and lesson to little children.  I especially like the music in this one, and it keeps the attention of my son as well.

2113644,1,B0002PYFZ4,"This is not on a par with any of the countless other VeggieTales films of the last decade or so, quite possibly because this represents a corporate takeover of the formerly independent Big Idea. Not only does the central story lack the strong Christian foundation of ALL their other videos, but worse still they have invented a compromise by inserting a *very* religious mini-segment on St. Patrick. (Odd, because the DVD came out months before St. Pat's day) The problem is, this ""religious"" segment was clearly not written by Christians. It feels like the theological waffle of armchair Catholicism with only the vaguest sense of sound doctrine. I was appalled that a film from a series widely marketed to ""Christians"" would seek to enforce such uniquely Roman Catholic doctrines (not held by a vast number of Christians) as the separation of persons in the Roman ""Trinity"" concept and the posthumous elevatuion of mortals to Sainthood by Church authority. Not only are these doctrines which are *guaranteed* to cause division among adult viewers (how many *parents* have seen these films a dozen times each?) they are also so far above the understanding of the pre-school audiences the series targets that it is incomprehensible such things were included. Add to that a ridiculous polemic against Paganism (not offensive to me, but hugely inaccurate) and a main storyline which positively promotes fighting as a good thing, and you have something utterly unfit for Christians OR children. If I want my kid to see positive portrayals of fighting, I can put on a road runner cartoon. At least I know Wile E.

2113648,3,B0002PYFZ4,"My 4 year old daughter and I have watched a good dozen of the Veggietales movies together. This one was probably the least interesting, at least for her age group. She enjoyed the St. Patrick ""feltboard"" story, but I think she was mostly reacting to my laughter. I like the way they made his story interesting, even if it stretched the truth a bit to do it.

She'd played the ""Sumo of the Opera"" game on their website and was looking forward to the story. Maybe is was too old for her and too young for me, neither one of us found it funny or educational.

I hope whoever's writing the stories for Veggietales can get to the simple storylines of the older videos. Gilbert and Sullivan mixed with Rocky movie references, what kid likes that? Even the silly song was disappointing.",1105747200,3,779,4.47887323943662
2113649,2,B0002PYFZ4,"My 6yo son really likes this video, and has watched it several times.  As a Bible-believing Christian, however, I believe in telling children the truth about my beliefs, and so I found this story's many inaccuracies problematic. For example, the idea that the people of pre-Christian Europe worshipped ""twigs and pond scum"" and, as is later implied, also worshipped shamrocks and gullibly believed everything St. Patrick told them is just a grotesque, disparaging distortion.  There was no need for that kind of demeaning portrayal, not to mention that it's historically inaccurate to the point of being misinformation.  The St. Patrick's segment also had very cheap SouthParkesque animation that really takes away from the storytelling. The story itself is so meandering that its point is lost on young children early on. It's just not very good on any level.

The music in this video is by far the best thing about it - the song about the homophones is terrific and the title song is a GREAT send up of Gilbert & Sullivan, but mostly the story is mindless, meandering filler with, as another reviewer said, the very weak and obtuse ""message"" tacked on at the end. The fact that this video out and out *lies* to children about heathenism and implies that all people who believed in pagan religions were drooling idiots is the most troublesome aspect.  The Lord wants us to come to Him in truth and with a humble spirit, not because a video conned us into thinking anyone who wasn't Christian is a delusional moron.

Even the voiceover work on this one was subpar- even very young children who have seen the Jonah the Veggie Tales film will recognize the voice of Lufti the Caterpillar from a character in the Jonah video, because it's exactly the same voice and accent.  Dude, if you can only do one funny voice, maybe your chosen career shouldn't be cartoon voices.

The video's not horrible, but it's surely one of their worst offerings, and I don't recommend this when there are other gems like ""Madame Blueberry,""  ""The Ballad of Little Joe"" and the Larry Boy series in the Veggie Tales library that are more well done, more entertaining, and more solidly espousing ""Sunday morning values.""",1103328000,10,2195,4.847593582887701
