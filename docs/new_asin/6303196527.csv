592365,5,6303196527,"Once one gets past the required Marxist dialectic (""rich people bad, poor people good""), there is nothing less than splendid about this Soviet film. The cinematography alone is breathtaking, and the irony of the more adventuresome characters' constant refrain, ""They can't exile you any further than Siberia!"" is not lost.
The ""underdog"" family in the film produces men in each generation who shake their fist at their village, rhetorically, and try to get away, but they are always pulled back somehow.  As the revolutionary  Nikolai says to his young son Alexei, ""It's not a good place, but it's the best place for us.""
The acting is first rate.  Grief, loss, hope, and faith are equally represented throughout the film.  Most of the actors are more low-key than in Hollywood films (a fact that allows the Siberian woodlands and scenes of village life, as well as stock film of national events,  to play out much of the story).  But they do not lack passion.  Especially touching is a scene of a youngster grieving for his father.  The young actor gives a performance beyond his years.
The recurrent themes and beautiful scenery and music (folk  during the rural scenes, electronic  during the sped-up, sepia- tinted stock footage) make the six hours of film very easy to digest.  Konchalovsky's Siberiade suggests a cinematic Tchaikovsky symphony, with its alternating poignant romance, pathos, and an ending of hopefulness.",1065657600,76,1427,5.081545064377682

My point: One of the last great Russian historical dramas
Over 6 decades of the history of the great Russian land and the country USSR through the lives of two families in a small Siberian village. Two opposite families: Ustuganins, the pure ones; and Solomins, the rich ones. The story of life, love, betrayal, happiness and pain.
This film is very long and very slow. Cinematography is excellent, but it doesn't bother you... it is only helping you to get into the story and the beauty of the Russian land.
If you love good films, if you are interested in history and Russia? A must se.

592367,5,6303196527,"I saw this film in Madrid, in 1979... in Russian with Spanish sub-titles and at the time I spoke no Russian and hardly any Spanish.  But no matter, it instantly became my all time favorite movie.  I saw the original 6 hour version in two evenings... and it wasn't a minute too long.  The main ""character"" is really the natural splendor of Siberia.... it is a visual jewel. I have since seen cut versions... at various film festivals... the 4 hour version, and the 3 hour version.

592368,4,6303196527,"""Siberiade"" is an epic Russian film which spans three generations and chronicles the lives of two rival Siberian families.  It is also a deeply spiritual film which depicts the breathtaking beauty and power of the Siberian land.  We see how the people's lifestyle has always adapted to the environment of the taiga, and had remained little affected by the changes wrought by revolution, politics, or war.  That is, until the lure of oil brings greed and devastation to their remote village.  There is a defining scene early on in the film, in which a lynx has been captured.  Hanging upside down, paws trussed to a horizontal pole, jaws wedged apart and muzzled, the cat thrashes and moans in torment.  Nearby, in callous oblivion to the suffering of the magnificent animal, the two human protagonists envision their future fortune.  The scene is to me profoundly disturbing, first because it is obvious that a real lynx was tortured in the filming of the scene -- not many international productions in 1979 gave thought to cruelty to animals.  But the abuse of the beautiful wild cat is symbolic of the theme of the film -- how the wild Siberian land itself will soon be exploited and despoiled.  Nature must be dominated in the name of progress.  And ultimately the people's ties to their land and the spirits of their ancestors are violently severed.  This is how the film affected me; the imagery of its haunting climax remains with me.",979603200,36,1440,4.813008130081301
592369,5,6303196527,"I first saw this film when I was 7 years old, in a funky theatre in SF.  My parents took me and my best friend and we had no idea what we were about to experience.  I am now 30 and can say that certain imagery from this film  is as indelibly imprinted on my memory as events that have occurred in my  own life.  In college I studied  film and can trace my earliest desires to  make films of my own to the emotions and sensory intoxication of seeing  this film.  It captures the amazing history of a continent in a very  personal and real sense.  It terrifies and triumphs and most of all makes  the cinematic experience one that you will carry with you for a long time.  After 15 years of searching for a copy of this film a friend of mine  suggested Amazon....  If only I could get my local artsy-fartsy theatre to  screen it.",956620800,27,827,4.1069182389937104
592370,5,6303196527,"Andron Konchalovskii is certainly the stronger one when considering him to Nikita Mikhalkov. Siberiade is a stronger movie about Russia and Russians than the latest ""jewel"" from Nikita Mikhalkov called  ""Siberian Barber"". You can also see an influence from Tarkovskii  on Konchalovskii in this movie (b/w scene on the swamp). Both of them were  working on Andrei Rublev.

592484,5,6303196527,"How fitting I should be writing this review on Leo Tolstoy's 186th birthday!  Because this film evolves like a classic Russian novel it will not suit all tastes; especially the modern film consumer who wants a cut-and-dried morality play scripted to rise and fall in 120 minutes, with plenty of gratuitous violence dealt out to bad guys.  If such is your taste, move on: nothing to see here.

For those of us who appreciate a film that captures life in all its hard realities and ""known unknowns,"" this one will draw you in and keep you *because* of its convoluted characterizations and historical sweep. It is a very Russian story, essentially a tale of spiritual redemption wrapped in an outer layer of socialist industry.  Without, I hope, creating a spoiler, it portrays socialist development as the material force of said redemption:  a very Biblical climax where a swampland, consumed in flames, fulfills the prophecy of ""no more water but fire next time.""  The dead, liberated from their rest in Mother Earth, do indeed ""live again"" in Tolstoy's phrase; as well as in Taya's announcement at the end of the story.

I can hear the detractors now who would denounce this film as Soviet propaganda.  Nothing could be further from the truth. No, it does not engage in denunciations of the ""regime.""  The Party apparatchiks are portrayed as thoughtful, even philosophical, men who ultimately ""do the right thing.""  The film seems to flinch from portraying the underside of the Stalin era: no gulags, purges, etc.  Yet denunciation is not the film's purpose.  Russia's class war of the early 20th century was real; as was the redemptive hope of early Bolsheviks like Kolya.  Socialist development's moral and patriotic undertones in Soviet society were also very real. (For such effect there is even included a brief audio clip of Fidel Castro speaking in Spanish.)  The period posters and photographs of Stalin were even daring, in their own way, as Stalin had been quietly expunged from Soviet culture for the quarter century previous to this film.

An excellent montage of its era and place, whose true theme is the human search for redemption on earth.",1410220800,,2156,4.933518005540166
592485,3,6303196527,Kinda slow but its still a good Movie.,1409443200,,38,3.875
592486,4,6303196527,"The drama, action and acting are good and the plot is interesting. The movie is over four hours long but with the rapid advancement of the time frame and the changing political environment this entails the movie stays interesting. The movie starts with an oil rig explosion then jumps back to the beginning of the century in Siberia. There we meet a boy called Koyla (his name is Bolshevik Nikolai Ustyuzhanin) at about the age of 10, the movie soon jumps to him in his late teens at which time he leaves Siberia. The movie picks up again many years later when he returns to Siberia with his son Alexei. From there the movie follows his son, mostly while he is in Siberia and skipping most of the long time periods when he is away. The overall history of Russia is intertwined with what is happening in Siberia. The political climate is at times shown through the use of archive news footage.

Throughout the movie there is a conflict between the Ustyuzhanin family (this being Koyla and Alexei) and the Solomin family, this conflict reflects the changing nature of Russia. As of Koyla's first return to Siberia with his son this conflict takes on the subject of developing of the natural resources in Siberia, especially oil and gas. I have no doubt that there is a great deal of symbolism here which I did not see due to my limited knowledge of  Russian history and therefore the more a person knows of Russia the more they are likely to get from this movie.

As I stated earlier the action and acting are good, however there are some major continuance as well as other technical errors in the movie. The most noticeable is about twenty-five minutes into the movie at which time Koyla (about 10-years-old) is running round outside in the snow totally nude. Most of the time he is seen at a distance from head to toe from the viewpoint of a slightly older girl who told him to do it. However briefly he runs over to her and the camera angle changes to behind him and shows him from just below the knees up. During this brief shot he is wearing knee high boots but when the camera angle switches back to her point of view he is again totally nude. The other errors are not quite as noticeable.

There are a couple of other nude scenes in the movie. In one the breasts of a young woman (around 20) are seen. In the other a young woman (probably around 18 or 19) is skinning dipping and is seen fully nude from both front and rear after getting out of the water.",1403481600,,2460,4.423841059602649
592487,2,6303196527,"I like the concept of a big multi-generational Russian epic, but the result is disjointed and not always easy to follow. There is, however, some excellent acting.",1400716800,,162,5.037037037037037
592488,5,6303196527,"This film is probably a master piece. To summarize the history of Russia and the Soviet Union in some four odd hours is in itself a miracle. But what's more it concentrates on Siberia and it follows one little village, Elan, in this region, and in this village essentially three generations of the Ustyuzhanin family, in fact Afanasi, the grand father, then Nikolai the father and Aleksei the son, as opposed to the other family in the village, the Solomins. The first family are the poor ones, the underlings before the revolution, the others are the top family. The revolution of course transforms these relations and we follow the lives of these three men essentially in their village, when they are there since they are often rejected, or they just go away, and then they come back. Dramatically.

Afanasi is the only one who does not come back. He is always there and lives alone with his son and no wife.

Nikolai comes back as a Soviet officer, a Communist cadre and it is dramatic because he had been thrown away at the beginning of the revolution and his paramour, from the other family, had escaped from the village to find him and follow him. It will be a difficult situation since she will be burned to death by the white Cossacks during the civil war after the revolution. He comes back with his young son in the 1930s and is killed by the other paramour of his wife, the one she left behind.

Aleksei is sent to an orphanage, then on one visit to the village and his relatives a recruiting unit at the very beginning of the war against Nazi Germany accepts his enlisting, though he is slightly too young, and he will be a hero in the war, saving his captain all by himself. But in the 1960s he comes back as a master driller to drill for oil in his village because he knows there is some: he discovered it with his father when he was a kid when they marched into the marsh known as the Devil's Mane and there oil was oozing out all over the place and they managed to set it on fire, accidently. Aleksei though wants to leave after a while, with the woman he had taught how to dance when just under 18 before he enlisted, and it is when he finally can go and is going to go, alone because the woman refuses to follow him, he goes say goodbye to his drilling mates and it is then oil is struck and starts bursting out. But it gets on fire for some unimportant reason and the derrick falls and traps one man. All the others go and Nikolai manages the situation to save that man, but Nikolai is caught by the fire and dies.

But the film is a lot more important than that. It is a real film about history. You cannot force history to do something it does not want to do because you have to work with people and people do not necessarily want to change and you have to convince them. It may take three generations to move from the superstition about the Devil's Mane to the acceptance that the village is going to be completely transformed by that oil, and the most dramatic war possible in the meantime after a very dramatic and heroic revolution.

The film then shows how at the beginning of this political revolution Nikolai was nave and thought it was easy to make people do what they did not want to do, and he is killed just because his rival in love refuses to follow him and kills him. It fails because of some private business and affair, a love story that had not gone the way one of the lovers wanted. Trite, and yet history is also the result of such capricious and unpredictable elements. It will take thirty years and one generation for what was then possible in the 1930s to become a reality in the 1960s.

And in the 1960s we are no longer speaking of that kind of romantic revolution Nikolai had in mind. Aleksei and the other oil drillers around him are confronted to the stubborn desire of the central authorities in Moscow to develop the country and to decide in Moscow what is best for everyone and the small village and the country around is going to become the largest man-made sea with the largest hydroelectric dam and factory on the Volga. It is a pure miracle that makes oil burst out of its underground lair on the very same day, killing Aleksei, as the central committee of the Communist Party or some other bureaucratic authority like this one is meeting to take a decision in favor of the dam. The events stop the dam project in its shoes and in its trail. Unluckily, and Konchalovsky knew all about it in 1979, that was the last moment when history was right against the bureaucrats. After that the USSR entered a very dark time when bureaucracy was the only possible authority and initiative from people was discouraged and even choked, and stagnation started, leading finally to regression and the fall of the USSR. We feel that end the director could not know under the open discourse about the heroism of this Aleksei.

The last but one thing about the film that has to be said is that the director chose to always look at historical events through the intimate eyes of one character or another, mainly the Ustyuzhanins. The truth is in the eyes of the beholders and not in the brains of the leaders. The death of Lenin is actually shown, but the death of Stalin is not and when the older Aleksei revisits as a dream his visit as a child of the Devil's Mane with his father, he gets inside a small hut that had been used by some hypothetical drillers. Aleksei is dreaming of course at this moment and he gets afraid and starts calling his father, as he had done when a child, and to get out of the hut he has to tear up a portrait of Stalin. This scene is of course very symbolical, especially since in the next minute he sinks in some quicksand and drowns, another symbolical act in that dream of his.

The last element I would like to emphasize is the way the director plays on the fake black and white (always in a shade that is not black, sepia or green, etc) to have archives images of some historical moments, Lenin's arrival in Petrograd, his funeral, and later on Gagarin, for example. At the same time the same fake black and white sequences are used to bring the wishes, the dreams, the recollections of the characters. The real time of each episode is in full colors. That gives a real density to the film as if we constantly had a film in the film with flashbacks and at times flash-forwards into the future (rarely) and into dreams (more often).

I must reckon it is not easy to find that film in DVD. I got the US edition in NTSC in Russian with English subtitles. But it was worth it.

592490,5,6303196527,"A masterpiece in every aspect, this is an epic film that has very few equals.  It is not a 'tool' of the Soviet state, as some reviewers imply - far from it, ""Siberiade"" is a great example of just how far Mosfilm filmmakers could go in political and social commentary without the political commissars even noticing.  A case in point: Part 4, when Moscow's central planners - wholly ignorant of Siberia - decide to build a huge artificial lake for a hydroelectric project, thus burying the USSR's greatest oil and natural gas resources.  The fight to stop this idiocy is the major story arc in Parts 3 & 4.  It's hard to imagine this is an official Mosfilm production in 1979, but it is.  In ""Siberiade"" you will find beauty, brutality, romance, betrayal, politics ... but most of all, bravery, and a special unsought nobility among the people of the taiga.

My interest was caught as the film opened and I was still avidly absorbed with story, setting, characters as it ended.

592563,4,6303196527,"Konchalovsky--who directed the incredible ""Maria's Lovers""--has made a haunting work of epic proportions that manages to remain intimate and poetic. An evocative film of great energy that rewards repeat viewings.

The over-the-top seems to be a specialty of Italian and Russian cinema. Sometimes it works (""Nights of Cabiria"", ""Amarcord"", ""Siberiade"") sometimes no so much (""Come and See""). Playing to the back-rows can make for grotesque and humorous effects. Konchalovsky had me chortling one minute, tearing-up the next. That coincidence of opposites (tragic buffoonery) is a rarity, so don't miss the opportunity to experience it. A magical mess of a film with a hauntingly beautiful score and larger-than-life performances.

But Siberiade has editing issues. It was originally planned as a four-part television series, as the numerous title-sequences and music-video intros make clear. Either the series should be restored or cuts made to form a more coherent cinematic experience. I would love to get my hands on ""Siberiade"" to tidy up the editing. (""Sprawl"" refers to the tendency to let scenes go on too long, though there are some shots I would have prolonged for maximum impact.) But I suspect coherence or neatness was not what Konchalovsky was after. But don't let that deter you from watching what is a work of genius.

Another criticism: Konchalovsky seems not to have cared much about lighting conditions or continuity in out-door scenes. Of course, he may have wanted the pale, washout-out look of milky, over-cast skies. The film would have been visually more striking (and no doubt more expensive) if he had optimized sun-position. Ultimately, the compelling nature of the human drama makes one forget a certain sloppiness of execution. After all, we're getting performances of maximum spontaneity and verisimilitude.

The transfer is mostly fine, nothing outstanding. Considering that made for television features often have a remarkable amount of detail, I was a little disappointed there wasn't more of it here. One obvious short-coming was the amount of ""head space"" visible. Made me wonder whether I wasn't watching an open matte.

3) A whole plethora of actors that were and since have grown to be the monoliths of Russian (Soviet and post-) cinematic art such as Nikita Mikhalkov (at his best), Ljudmila Gurchenko (same), Solomin, Andreichenko and a few more whose names I don't remember right now.",1254700800,8,728,4.627906976744186

7840688,4,6303196527,"''Siberiade'' is a four-part made-for-television Soviet-era film from 1979. This DVD set contains two DVDs (two parts per each DVD) and runs 260 minutes. The film was directed by Andrei Mikhalkov Konchalovsky, who also wrote and directed ""Uncle Vanya"" and ""Nest of the Gentry"" (as well as the horrid ""Tango and Cash,"" but let's forgive and forget). The famous Russian writer-director-actor Nikita Mikhalkov is Konchalovsky's younger brother.

''Siberiade'' begins in 1909 and covers approximately 60 years in the lives of two families in the tiny Siberian town of Elam: the Ustyuzhanins are poor foresters and shepherds (working folk), while the Solomins are relatively wealthy middle men. Obviously, it is not easy to cover 60 years of history in only three hours: the film starts in pre-revolutionary Siberia and briefly touches on the civil war, the 1930s, 1939-1945 war, and finally the 1960s with the industrial development in Siberia.

While this film is very good, I gave it a four-star rating (instead of five stars) because the director and editor could have done a much better job creating a coherent story. The lack of coherency may be due to the fact that this film was originally intended to be longer.

The performances are extremely good, especially the performances by Lyudmilla Gurchenko (as the older Taya Solomina) and Nikita Mikhalkov (as Alexei Ustyuzhanin). As with most Soviet films, the characters act like real, complex people most of the times, with some Moscow Circus exaggeration thrown in from time to time.

The cinematography by Levan Paatashvili is the best part of this film.
