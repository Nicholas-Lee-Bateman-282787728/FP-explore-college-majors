7840369,5,6303147186,My children loved this movie as they grew up. It was one of their favorites. Because the video had worn out I had hoped to find the DVD or Blueray for sale. WHY haven't they re-released this movie?,1483228800,,197,4.2105263157894735
7840370,5,6303147186,A great movie! Has been my favorite since I was a kid! The quality of the video was excellent!,1456876800,,94,4.0
7840371,5,6303147186,"I have nothing but affection for this movie, in spite of any faults it may have. Is it a perfect movie(?), no. But taken as a whole piece, it basks in the sunlight of the South. The imagination and explanations of the characters are priceless. Did kids in the south really act & think like this(?), you bet! Coming of age movies are always difficult to act out with child actors, but they pull this one off.  I'd compare this to Goonies any day, or Stand By Me. Now on to the grisly facts. For whatever copyright reason or legal hassles, this wonderful movie never made it to DVD. So, that thrusts you into the nebulous world of VHS tapes. I paid a vendor $18 and some change for a movie copy that turned out to be a rental and is almost worn out and un-watchable. Sold to me as ""excellent"" condition. Make sure whomever you buy the VHS from has a 100% return policy. Thinking highly of yourself and your little cottage industry doesn't really mean anything, if your products are lacking and your descriptions dishonest.",1449964800,,1020,4.454545454545454
7840372,5,6303147186,The movie is on YouTube for free.,1424476800,,33,3.857142857142857
7840373,5,6303147186,"A great family movie for all ages. You will not be disappointed. You can smell the fragrance of summer as you run barefoot through the clover, not a care in the world and laughing at life, but starting to experience the first pains of love and life.  It took me back to when I was a boy reading Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn for the first time. It would be great if they would release this on DVD.",1405728000,2,399,4.115384615384615
7840374,5,6303147186,"great movie, it took a little time to get here, but the quality was great. I will be using amazon the next time I am looking for anything",1397692800,,137,3.9285714285714284
7840375,5,6303147186,"I didn't notice when I ordered River Pirates that it was VHS only.  I wanted to send it back to you.  However, I found a VCR in storage.  Now I can watch the movie.",1378944000,,164,3.764705882352941
7840376,5,6303147186,"I was really surprised I received my package so quickly, and the VHS was in excellent condition. Also, a DVD was enclosed in the package with the VHS movie. Totally not expecting this!",1365465600,,184,4.606060606060606
7840377,1,6303147186,"I really should have returned this video, but i jsut didn't get around to it.  It was listed in good condition, but we could barely hear the conversation because of background distortion.  We watched it once and i was sad as i had hoped to be able to watch it over and over.  I remember enjoying this story so much as a kid and wanted my kids to enjoy it too.",1356825600,,359,4.028169014084507
7840378,4,6303147186,"I watched this movie. Some sources say, ""My Dog Skip,"" is the 'unofficial prequel' to this. ""Good Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood,"" first aired exclusively on The Disney Channel back in 1988. The TV movie is was distributed by Multimedia Entertainment. NBC Universal now owns the defunct company's video library. This TV movie should be reissued on DVD and on Blu-Ray. There many other fans out there who feel the same way, as well.",1293667200,14,425,4.756756756756757
