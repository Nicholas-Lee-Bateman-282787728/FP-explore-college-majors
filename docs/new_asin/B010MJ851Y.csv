7313788,3,B010MJ851Y,"Mediocre screenplay, not well-thought out, or plausible. Misses out on the opportunity of giving us a credible window into the period's everyday life
(e.g.: like the HBO series Rome so successfully did)
The protagonist can't decide if he is a spoiled brat, or a social progressive, with a bit of Harun-al-Rashid thrown in.
Ben Kingsley does his best he can with the lame plot.  Spectacular visuals though.",1495843200,,405,5.044776119402985

His wife, the queen, and his new love, all did a great job and of course Ben Kinglsey is ALWAYS fantastic!

7313801,1,B010MJ851Y,"The film is ridiculous. The plot is weak and boring and the actors play poorly. It looks like a bad high-school play with huge budget.

There is no link whatsoever with historical facts. Tutankhamun's era Egyptians wore wigs and had their heads shaved or had very short hair. The actors wear long hair and sparse beards. General Horemheb, the future pharaoh, is tall, fat and black. Based on its statues and paintings we know that he was slim, short and white. On the other hand Tutankhamun's era Egyptians were extremely racist. They despised and hated the both the black Africans and Asians. Having an African playing Horemheb It's like a black actor would play Hitler. The king of Mittani is also black, which it doesnt make sense either. The people of Mittani were an Indo-Persian and no Africans.

But beyond all historical absurdities the biggest problem is the lack of any exciting plot and pathetic acting.",1487721600,4,914,4.852564102564102

7313816,5,B010MJ851Y,"I saw this movie last year 2015, when it premiered on Spike TV, the first original. My mind was blown; it was like an NC17 flick LOL some sensual body motion, and some nudity going on, but also excellent acting. However, when the second TUT, (The back-by-popular-demand) TUT came on Spike TV, the network cut some of the nudity out, made it mild. I suspect that this DVD is like the second half of TUT, mild, I haven't seen this one.
Nevertheless, I have seen this movie, and I do recommend it. (About the movie)
The sad thing is that as a little boy, TUT had to wed his sister and try to produce a boy child to carry on as king pharaoh, he fell in love with this poor African woman from the outside streets, had sex with her and she got pregnant, and his sister couldn't either get pregnant, or kept having miscarriages. Well, you probably know how this'll end. :-0 cat fight LOL",1478304000,,880,4.307228915662651
7313817,3,B010MJ851Y,"I enjoyed the actors and actresses a lot more than I did the story. There was just something about this story that didn't keep me engaged even though I really wanted to be drawn into the time period. I will have to see some of the new actors and actresses in other roles to make up my mind on their abilities, but this lacked a certain quality. I said it was okay mostly because there was just enough there for me to want to look up some of the actual facts about these historical figures, so it wasn't a complete loss.",1477872000,,519,4.148514851485149

7313829,5,B010MJ851Y,"Episode 1: In 1332 BC, Egypt is the most powerful nation in the world and there's an internal fight for power. In Thebes, Akhenaten, or Amenhotep IV, is poisoned by a servant. His nine-year-old-son Tutankhamun takes the throne and marries his half-sister Ankhesenamun to have a pure bloodline heir. Due to his youth and Vizier Ay's decisions as a counselor member, the people deem him weak. In ten years, Tutankhamun finds his kingdom facing economic problems and a plague weakens his army and kills his people. Tutankhamun is decided to gain control of his kingdom, show his people that he is a strong pharaoh, and face his enemies, even when he is left to death by General Horemheb and his friend Ka.
Episode 2: A half Mitanni half Egyptian woman, Suhad, finds Tutankhamun deadly hurt. She takes him to her village and treats him. Betrayed by his inner circle, Tut, his loyal soldier Lagus and Suhad, head to Thebes to impede that Ka marries Ankhesenamun and becomes pharaoh. Tut interrupts the wedding and kills Ka, he tells the people that he is Tutankhamun, their pharaoh. Tut falls in love with Suhad and decides to make her his wife, what disturbs Ankhesenamun because both women are pregnant.
Episode 3: Tut offers a treaty of peace to the Mitanni King, but the King decline it. Without another alternative, Tut leads his weakened army in a sneak attack through a secret entrance to the enemies' territory. Meanwhile, in Thebes, the High Priest, Amun leads a revolt to kill Tut. Ankhesenamun kills Suhad. Tutankhamun is hurt during his victorious battle, even so he decides to return to Thebes to face and destroy his enemies. After killing the High Priest, he doesn't resist to his injures and die.
Comment: Without any doubt, my favorite character is Tut; he is sweet, tender, generous, but he is also a leader. Tut knows what he wants, where his place is, and what he has to do to destroy his enemies. He is smart and wise; he makes great decisions and it infuriates his enemies.
His problems start when he grows up and decides that it is time to rule Egypt. He faces many problems; Horemheb and Ay also want the throne, and the High Priest wants to keep the cults to many gods.
With so many problems, Tut needs a pure blood heir to carry on his heritage. His marriage is a burden for him, as well for Ankhesenamun, who is in love with Ka. In addition to that, Ankhesenamun and Ay don't approve his romance with an half Mitanni and peasant; they make plans to get rid of the woman, but Suhad is Tut's protge.
Suhad is too nave; she trusts Ankhesenamun, big mistake. The royal queen prepares an ambush to Suhad; Lagus saves the woman. However, Suhad doesn't have the same luck the second time.
The scenery is wonderful; it seems you are in Thebes, in the desert. They reproduced the palace, temples, sculptures and hieroglyphs very well. You feel as if you are transported to the ancient Egypt. It's interesting because the series shows us a little of that ancient and curious culture, its gods, legends, habits, and mythologies.
The characters' costumes are wonderful too; long, colored, embroidered and exclusive dresses, skirts, and tunics; the colors are very vivid and attractive. At least, the ones Tut, Ankhe, Ay and his son wear. The characters wear jewelries and show you how they were rich and prosperous.
The series also shows the cults to the gods; they have a god for everything: sun, war, fertility, wisdom People have to pay tributes and homage to the gods; the temples are destined for the priests and the royal family.
Well, I loved it! I've watched the series three times. If you like fantasy, mythology and are curious about Egypt, it's a great opportunity to know a little more about that ancient culture.  It's based on real events, but it has its magic.

7313835,1,B010MJ851Y,"Ancient Egypt has never been so boring.  Beautiful actors, costumes and kohl eyeliner can not save this snooze fest.  Tut is a young man struggling to gain power in his own kingdom - though his advisers, friends, priests and even wife seem to plot against him at every turn... and that should be fun to watch.  Unfortunately, it falls flat on its face.  When you really don't care for any of the characters, it's impossible to choose sides or care.  The ""romance"" was awkward and stunted, but not nearly as awkward as the soft-core sex scenes.  Is this Red Shoe Diaries?  I felt like a saxophone should be playing every time our young lovers got frisky in the sheets.  It looked more like a strange ballet than sex.  In these most intimate of moments, you felt the coldness of the characters.  Did the actors just hate each other?  What's going on here?  All this plays out in glorious Ancient Egypt... just kidding!  It looks like a very fancy set for a play... maybe something the MET would put together for an opera.  Egypt comes across as dreary, not majestic... almost cartoonish in some scenes and just rocky desert in others.  The fight scenes were horrible.  The sound, at least through my television, was painfully loud as the musical score played and almost a murmur when people were talking.  The director, cinematographer and screenwriter should all be forced to write an apology letter that is included at the end of the credits.  MST3K needs to create a RiffTrax of this stinker.",1468886400,,1493,4.676923076923077

Acting is superb most of the time except the lack of facial expressions is a bit strange. Having read a few historical novels, did not expect historical accuracy and realized this was filmed for entertainment. Lots of minor flaws, and wish the Australians would lighten up on the homocides and violence. Tut was not Caligula and he was not ""a religious"" meaning ""clergy"". Not necessary to constantly besmirch them as some Aussie criminals do.",1465603200,,584,4.969387755102041

7313860,1,B010MJ851Y,"I was on the fence about this as I had heard it was a little graphic, or had a lot of sex scenes which I'm not a fan of. I bit the bullet, and bought episode one anyway to try it out because I was really interested in a mini series with Egyptian themes.

As a fan of everything from StarGate, to the original campy action shows like Xena and Hercules, I have to say this series is melodrama to the max. Terrible from the beginning. Dry. Badly written, and cliche. Yes, the clothing is beautifully done, but the sets, although massive, appear cardboard-like and fake. I'm glad I only bought part one instead of all three. I had high hopes for this show as I love Egyptian mythology and history and studied it as a child. Oh well.

The character development is weak. It's all story and action. It's a real disappointment. Did Kingsley need a boat payment? It was way beneath him.

The worst part about it is the sound. It was very uneven. All of a sudden it would get really loud during the ""majestic"" battle scenes. Like I couldn't tell that it was exciting without that. (sigh) This series has a lot of slickness, but nothing to grasp my heart.",1458259200,,588,4.547169811320755

7313864,3,B010MJ851Y,"Spike tried to follow a tried and true recipe that HBO has used very successfully.  Pick a mysterious and fantastic time and place. Put some young, attractive people and have them unfold a great story as they have a lot of sex and violent fighting. We've all seen how incredibly successful their ""Game of Thrones"" is.

They also struck gold with ""Rome"" and other epic sagas like ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Blood."" Unfortunately, Spike didn't follow all the little details of HBO's recipe that has yielded such a delicious array of guilty pleasures.

They didn't have a strong cast.  Oh, they had one classic blockbuster star, Ben Kingsley, who said his words bravely but looked like he was depressed to be there. The title actor and his queen would have been quite at home in a soap opera set in a Hollywood poolside but they were utterly out of their league. In no way could they compete with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano or Ray Stevenson as Titus Pullo or Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse.

They didn't have enough romance. Oh they hinted at it but no really good nipple bearing with flashes of fur that all the geeks crave.

Worst of all, they didn't have the writing. There was never a mystery. At every step Tut had pretty much one choice and he followed that choice, without humor and with little joy or imagination. I'm not criticizing it for utter historical inaccuracy. That is expected and is forgivable. I'm criticizing it for being so predictable and boring. Here, King Tut was not a part of ancient Egypt but was such a painfully 21st century Generation X'er.

It wasn't a bad miniseries. It was just such an ordinary one.",1458086400,3,1637,4.643598615916955

7313913,4,B010MJ851Y,"The life of Tutankhamun, shadowy successor to the heretic-Pharaoh Akhenaten of Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, has fascinated students of ancient history since Howard Carter's dramatic discovery of a hidden tomb. Now, thanks to Spike, that life has come to the small screen as a lavishly produced miniseries.

Because Tut's life was shadowy, the miniseries' writers and producers had to fill in blanks with real and invented characters in situations that likely happened, may have happened, or could never have happened as shown, but are entertaining. The result of characters in conflict is a complex, but dynamic plot that never flags.

The directors assembled a cast that is serviceable at its weakest and stellar at its strongest. Headlining the cast even above Tut is Sir Ben Kingsley in the role of the scheming vizier Ay. Fans of the Bible Collection will recall Ben Kingsleys memorable performances as Potiphar and Moses. His turn as Ay is no less memorable. Ben Kingsley can do more with a twitch of an eyebrow than most actors can do with a page of script. His classical restraint makes his rare outbursts more powerful than they would otherwise be.

Next, cast in the role of Tut is a teen actor, Avan Jogia, who holds his own beside Sir Ben Kingsley with a performance of brooding intensity punctuated by emotions ranging from light humor to killing rage. If Tut is a sign of the future, Avan Jogia can foresee a long career as a leading man.

The Australian actor Sibylla Deen in the role of Tut's sister-wife Ankhesenamun is problematic, at times dazzling and at other times annoying. She can hold her own with the leading actors, but has a strong tendency to over-enunciate her words and overdo her facial expressions to the point that they detract from the action. She's at her best in scenes of trauma and mourning, which were likely, sad to say, as common in the real Ankhesenamun's life as in the miniseries.

As a long-time fan of Star Trek, I enjoyed seeing Alexander Siddig, formerly Siddig el-Fadil, in the invented role of High Priest Amun. (The name Amun is invented; the position of high priest is not.) Alexander Siddig brought an amazing expressiveness, both verbally and physically, to his role. At times, his action veered into excess, but, in a production on the scale of Tut, excess is hardly a vice.

Kylie Bunbury was excellent in the invented role of Suhat, Tut's true love interest: a woman, half of enemy blood, who saves him from death and becomes first a secondary wife in his harem and then a player for supreme power. Kylie Bunbury brought a broad range of genuine emotion to her role, which illustrates the vagaries of love, childbearing, and scheming for influence and succession in a polygamous royal court.

Peter Galiot, in the invented role of Lagus, a soldier who rises to become Tut's right-hand man, was good in acting, but jarring in appearance. His bearded, blue-eyed looks in a cast otherwise mostly convincing as Ancient Egyptians would have worked if he could have been passed off as a Greek mercenary who had risen to influence in the Egyptian army, but no Greek mercenaries had made it as far as Thebes in the Eighteenth Dynasty. I will discuss another problem, not with the acting, but with the writing, of his role later.

Iddo Goldberg in the invented role of Ka, a friend to Tut and a no-so-secret lover to Ankesenamun, was the weakest member of the main cast. Coming across to me as youthful and inexperienced beside the rest of the cast, he could have been the trusted, yet treacherous friend of any teen drama. Let me mention here a minor cavil about the miniseries: the Ancient Egyptians may well have made up nicknames for such a mouth-filling name as Ankhesenamun, but the way that Ka called her ""Ankhe"" came across to me as just silly.

I welcomed seeing Nonso Anozie, who had given a striking performance as Samson in Mark Burnet and Roma Downey's The Bible, in the role of General Horemheb. The actor brought an imposing calm to Horemheb in repose and a riveting intensity to the character to moments of conflict, which were continual in the miniseries. I doubt that I am giving too much away when I say that, late in the production, he gets to be Samson again.

Of the miniseries minor characters, Nakht, Ays son, was impressive, mostly sullen, but sometimes charming. Nakht-Min was a real person, in line to succeed Ay when he took the throne, but he somehow disappears from history before Horemheb came to power.

Recently, casting in Middle Eastern historic epics has evoked an ongoing controversy. Some have correctly pointed out that blue-eyed, fair-skinned Europeans and Americans look nothing like Ancient Egyptians. With the exception of the actor playing Lagus, Tut's directors have avoided actors fitting this description. Modern Egyptians, who feel a special connection to Ancient Egypt, tend to argue that an Ancient Egyptian epic should feature Egyptian actors. In Tut, the closest approach to an Egyptian actor is the Anglo-Sudanese Alexander Siddig. Tut's directors followed a middle course by assembling an international, multiracial cast headlined by a pair of Anglo-Indians. Perhaps, the cast makes the statement that Ancient Egypt is humanitys common heritage.

The miniseries' strong performances are due in large part to strong direction. This shows especially in a number of amazing scenes in which the actors carry the action and conflict by expressions and body language alone. It takes both strong actors and a strong director to pull off such scenes, but they're a treat when they work, as they work in Tut.

The miniseries' main actors play against the background of the proverbial ""cast of thousands,"" each of them lovingly arrayed in authentic Ancient Egyptian attire. The cast moves through lavish, finely detailed, brilliantly colored sets with the look and feel of Ancient Egypt restored to life. The sets in turn give way to the awesome desolation of the Moroccan desert, a character in itself.

Cast, clothing, and setting are served by strong writing that centers on court intrigue, some of which had to have actually happened. The childless, inexperienced Tut strives to gain and hold on to power amid the maneuverings of Ay and Horemheb, both with an eye on succeeding Tut should he fail or die. Ankhesenamun, unable to bear a living heir, fights to hold on to her position as Chief Royal Wife against an outsider who might bear a royal heir. The high priest schemes to gain power for himself...

Sadly, the conflict involving the high priest loses by the director's decision to deal only cursorily with the religious conflict in Egypt before and during Tutankamun's reign. We get no clear sense that Tut's father, Akhenaten, had replaced the worship of the Egyptian pantheon with one god, the Aten, and that Tut began his reign as Tutankhaten and was maneuvered by his advisers into restoring worship of the old gods. In the miniseries, we get only a brief glimpse of Akhenaten and his son -- a glimpse that makes no mention of the religious conflict -- before we move on to the last years of Tut's reign. In this, we see a rivalry between Tut and High Priest Amun, but we get no real sense of that rivalry's cause. The miniseries' extras suggest that a number of scenes were filmed with Akhenaten and the boy Tut, but these scenes were left out of the miniseries and were unaccountably not included, even as deleted scenes, in the DVD. Their inclusion in an expanded version of Tut would have strengthened it and filled a fans desire to see more of the world that Tut restored. If nothing else, the miniseries Akhenaten is so impressive that I would have liked to see more of him.

In the real Tutankhamun's reign, Egypt faced a complex set of challenges within the kingdom and a complex set of rivalries and conflicts with rival powers north of the kingdom in what are now Syria and Iraq. No doubt for the sake of a plot that could be run in six hours of television time, the writers of Tut reduced the internal conflict to a plague that weakened the kingdom in the face of foreign invasion, and the external conflict to a single enemy, the Mitanni, portrayed as if they were the southern Nubians. The movie mentions Amurru, who were Semitic foes of the Egyptians from Mesopotamia, but a non-Egyptologist would easily confuse them with the Mitanni in the miniseries.

Having earned a master's degree in microbiology, I have learned never to expect much from Hollywood depictions of an epidemic. Tut did better than many another production has done in portraying its plague, though, in Tut, those who dramatically should have gotten sick did get sick, and those who dramatically should not have gotten sick did not get sick, in the grand Hollywood manor. The miniseries did do a good job of showing how a plague disrupts a kingdom at all levels and how ill equipped ancient empires were to deal with a plague. Over all, the plague scenes gave us a dramatic, dazzling pageant, which, in a production like Tut, is what really counts. Still, I cannot help wondering what the miniseries miracle medicine was.

The subplot involving the Mitanni gave us a mixed bag of action scenes. The early battles were majestically and meticulously filmed as fine examples of what battle scenes should be, mixing action on an epic scale with personal drama. The full-speed chariot charges are particularly spectacular. Should we hope for Tuts producers to remake Ben Hur? Later, however, a long sequence in which Tut and Suhat rescue Lagus from the Mitanni because Tut needs Lagus to help him regain power in Thebes comes to nothing when Lagus proves to be totally irrelevant to how Tut regains power. Still, the Lagus expedition does pay off in a final battle scene that is over the top -- totally unrealistic for its time and place. That being said, the scene was fun if you overlook its impossibilities.

The battle and rescue scenes give us a chance to see Action Tut, which is what we had come to a movie about Tut to see. It is sad, then, that, in real life, if the latest archaeological findings hold up, Tutankhamun was anything but an action figure. Still, would the real Tutankhamun blame us for watching what he might well have wished to be?

Any production on the scale of Tut has faults that one can find. It distracted me for the miniseries to contain a minor, disposable character named Seti. That is a fine Ancient Egyptian name, but anyone with even a smattering of Egyptology knows that Seti would be Horemheb's successor at the Eighteenth Dynasty's end, as this character could never be.

Too, it was distracting for the miniseries' young actors to wear their own long, flowing hair, as real Ancient Egyptians of the Eighteenth Dynasty would never have done. Loathing lice, both men and women shaved their heads; men generally went bald, whereas women wore wigs. Sir Ben Kingsley went authentic; why was what was good enough for him not good enough for everyone else? Many of the female extras looked spectacular in their wigs. As for Ankhsenamun, the Kool-Aid purple highlights in her hair made her seem more like a modern party-goer than an ancient queen.

From time to time, the younger actors, perhaps in an attempt to seem relevant to our time, dropped into contemporary language. It was jarring for me to hear the characters say OK. Even more jarring was it for Ankhsenamun to say at one point to Ay, Are you sure you're not being paranoid? Ancient Egypt and modern psychology do not go together. Do the writers not know that Ancient Egyptians spoke Victorian English? At least, viewers of movies set in Ancient Egypt have come to expect it.

What else? Oh, yes, could the half-Mitanni peasant Suhat really have written a letter in hieroglyphics (all right, technically, hieratic)? I also wondered how a Mitanni soldier charging a position of Egyptian archers went down from an arrow in the back. Still, I've heard that strange events take place in battle.

I should mention for prospective viewers that Tut has a number of sex scenes containing partial nudity. Although the sex scenes are fairly explicit, they are not gratuitous, as all of them are deeply rooted in, and advance, the characters' passions and ambitions. How often these days do sex scenes actually advance a plot? Just keep in mind that you would have to be an Olympic athlete actually to do what the characters in the miniseries are shown as doing.

Finally in the nitpicking department, I should mention that, in some scenes, both boy Tut and teen Tut are shown walking with a limp, as the real-life Tutankhamun would have walked. In other scenes, however, the limp is nowhere to be seen. Of course, when Action Tut takes the stage, he verges on being a superhero -- at least to the end.

In the end, the miniseries' intrigue is so well handled that few viewers will be able to guess how the conflict plays out, even though we know from history that Tut, like the Titanic or the planet Krypton, is doomed. Over all, strong performances in a plot of complicated, well-motivated conflicts of life and death amid gorgeous settings and costumes make a lost world come to life before our eyes. If not all that takes place there can be true, it's at least well imagined. For the story, the acting, and the setting, you may well end up watching Tut again and again.",1452038400,,13341,4.8047079337401915

Plus during one episode there was a totally unnecessary local interruption regarding some politico happening that could have been easily forgone!  Be that as it may, we enjoyed the acting and the story line was relatively well written although it did stray pretty far from historical facts numerous times to accommodate Hollywood's version of Tut's exploits.  There were several scenes displaying nudity but they were tastefully handled and not dwelt upon.  Was a bit surprised the censors approved the miniseries for prime time.

I then spent the better part of the night watching the trailer for it over again several times. When I was able to watch it on the Spike Tv app it did not disappointment me. (I'm drawn to historical fiction stories..) I was only going to watch one part of it when all of it came to the spike app but ended up watching all three parts in one night.

I admit that it does have its inaccuracies. But I'm no Egyptologist so I can't pin point out exactly every one of them. Inaccuracies is to be expected. Especially with a civilization and a life that was way before our time.

With all that said; I highly recommend this series to anyone. If you thought you may not like it because it being fiction. Then cast that aside and at least give it a try. It is becoming on of my favorite shows. I have already seen it twice and working on a third time.",1444953600,4,976,4.1861702127659575

King Tut, judging by his skeletal autopsy would not have been able to stand up without something to prop him up or walk unaided except with a cane let alone fight in battle. He was not easy on the eyes and his hips were curved wide like a females'. He was a product of inbreeding.

7314023,5,B010MJ851Y,"This a brilliant and sprawling mini-series ....not to be missed telling the story of how 'Tutankhamun' (Kaiser Akhtar (young 'Tut' was thrust upon the throne of Egypt at the age of just Nine, married to his sister 'Ankhe' (Sibylla Deen)
Whist still very young the decisions of State were made for him by the ambitious aid 'Ay' (Ben Kingsley) and often overseen by the
High-Priest 'Amun' (Alexander Siddig) who claimed to have the ear of the Gods.
As 'King Tut' became a little older and perhaps wiser he began to form his own opinions on how things should be done in his name,
frequently discarding the council of those that had all but controlled the Empire during his early years.
'King Tut' often in disguise walked among his people in the streets of the city at night, anxious to learn all he could.
War was never far away, there was always an empire prepared to tackle the Might of Egypt, 'Young King Tut' insisted on involvement
in the battles against the Mitanni, even over-ruling his General 'Horemheb' (Nonso Anozie) in terms of battle tactics, which did put
the General at much unease.
'Tutankhamun' was a very focused and determined young King who certainly had a mind of his own.
When injured in battle 'King Tut' was left for dead bit was saved by a young woman 'Suhad' (Kylie Bunbury)'he had earlier met on the streets of his City whendoing his under-cover walkabouts.......romance wasn't far from either's minds.
In his absence 'King Tut' had been presumed dead, his sister who jealously held on to her position as Queen sought to make her lover
'Pharaoh'
However the Kings return with 'Sohad' in tow would be seen as a threat by 'Ankhe' who had been unable to bear 'King Tut' a child (son) no successor, 'Ankhe' will go to any lengths to maintain her status....
This is an intriguing story of betrayal, plotting and cheating as we follow the Young-Kings mythical journey to glory............
Of course as was the case on several occasions throughout 'Egyptian' History a previous rulers memory and history would be wiped
from record almost as if he never existed at all....this was indeed the case with the Young-King Tutankhamun......in truth little is known
about his rule.............but, wouldn't it be something if he was indeed the King portrayed in this mini-series.
Some good and sometimes graphic battle-sequences, and scenes of a sexual nature the mini-series is indeed a gem, not to be missed.

Love the storyline, too - it's really well written, and has a lot of action.  Am disappointed, Spike doesn't show it again.  And as always, Ben Kingsley is superb.  Love how Tut develops from a mere innocent boy into a great pharaoh - how he defeats the enemy with HIS plan, not the general's - HIS.  Great mind, great decision - very cunning, but very smart, too.  Am recommending this DVD to everyone who love anything ancient Egypt - like me.  Am so happy I caught the preview ad that got me to watch this.  Still have it on DVR - so, I can watch it again and again, until I buy the DVD in December as a Christmas gift to myself.

7314046,4,B010MJ851Y,"Pretty good action story set in New Kingdom Egypt. Tut makes a good subject for Historical fiction- he has name recognition for people who don't know much about Ancient Egypt yet little is known about his life, making embellishment of his biography easier.
Having some knowledge about the New Kingdom was where I stumbled. The Mitanni, whose kingdom at this time was limited to their homeland in what is now Northern Iraq and Syria, were on their way out as a great kingdom, having been dealt a severe defeat by Tut's ancestor Thutmose III. Canaan and Syria were nominally under Egyptian or Hittite control. Small Mitanni raiding detachments may have slipped across the border but the Mitanni were not the threat the filmmaker would have us believe.
Another problem is the Mitanni nobles, who are portrayed by black actors. The Mitanni were an Indo- European tribe ruling over Semetic subjects. Maybe not exactly blonde and blue- eyed but they were not of African descent.
The white dude portraying Tut's soldier friend however, works historically since many Indo- European mercenaries were hired from Anatolia. Egyptian armies were diverse as the ambitious Nubian general shows. But the battle scenes are silly, like most portrayals of ancient warfare are. Instead of a giant WWF style cage match, the soldiers would have fought in lines and columns. There would have been a lot more chariots, too.
Finally the costume designer must have raided the old set from HBO's Rome. The Egyptian infantry are carrying distinctly Roman pila instead of spears.
But I complain too much. It is actually fun for amateur historians like myself to pick out historical anomalies in shows like this. And the action is pretty good. The acting is convincing. The sets are gorgeous. Give it a chance.",1442880000,,1780,4.9966329966329965

A couple of weeks later I was sitting at home on a Saturday with no place to go and for some reason decided to look at TUT.  Mind you, I was only planning on watching it for an hour or so to pass time and I ended up watching the whole series.  I was riveted to the screen.  Suhad was the woman he loved.  Some people obviously are extremely confused about what real love is.  My heart melted when he told his sister she was all he had left in his heart.  I was slightly upset when TUT died, knew he had to but I wish the ending wouldn't have shown his death.  The series was too short, wish there were more episodes.  The other relationships in the show and the complications presented were well acted, not to mention TUT is not bad on the eyes. (I'd rather watch the young actor playing TUT than from what I read the real TUT who apparently was nothing in the looks department and was described as buck tooth, club footed with feminine hips).

He may be Pharaoh, but he's deliciously and warmly human -- flawed and tragic but clever, kindly and someone with whom you can identify -- and you find yourself wishing you could go back and change history. Very powerful. And his co-stars, including, of course, Sir Ben, fill the screen with enormous talent. Many of them are familiar to people who watch Game of Thrones, but even if you haven't, you will not forget them. Without commercials, each episode is about an hour and a half long. Good for a long evening of entertainment, or easy to break into three segments to fill the weekend. Either way, if you haven't seen this, I encourage you to do so. It's well worth the time.",1439683200,4,953,4.6117647058823525
7314091,1,B010MJ851Y,"Considering the real Tutankhamun died at 18, and this story has him older than that, I realized immediately historical accuracy was out the window.  The acting quality was sub-soap opera, and it was clear most of the actors were chosen erely from head shots.

If you think The Tudors was an accurate depiction of the reign of Henry VIII, you may enjoy this, since it has similar curtain-chewing acting, laughable dialogue, and poorly cast.",1439683200,6,439,4.918918918918919

7314093,5,B010MJ851Y,"I saw this show advertised but wasn't into it until I stumbled on some gifs on tumblr after the first episode had aired and that peaked my interest. I caught up with it on Xfinity and boy, was I blown away.
First, the costumes were absolutely mesmerizing and classy. The cast was superb and the acting was excellent. The actor who played Tut was exceptionally good and Sir Ben Kingsley was awesome as usual.

The story to me itself was spellbinding and I was captivated and glued to my TV as the story unfolded. It is very compelling, with twists and turns and action scenes that were so well-done with awesome cinematography and scenery.

I loved how the boy king evolved from being ignorant of the power, people and treachery around him to a boy who realized what power he had and fought to take control. The love story-arc just blew me away and that is what really carried the story for me. Avan and Kylie brought their A-game into playing Tut and Suhad and that really made this show memorable, addictive, great and emotionally draining.

Great job by all the actors involved and kudos to Spike TV for a job well done.

I would highly recommend this DVD to everyone and you will not be disappointed.",1439596800,34,1203,4.529953917050691

He's not only gorgeous to look at, but he is also very talented and completely embodied the Boy King. This is a coming of age story, but it is also a love story. It is much more than that, though; there is lots of intrigue, suspense, action and epic battles for those into that. Also, great sets, locations, wardrobe and a great cast, like others, I didn't want it to end. But all good things come to an end. I have to say, though, it really made me want to visit Egypt more than ever. Don't miss this great adventure and get the DVD asap. Also look out for Mr Jogia.

7314130,4,B010MJ851Y,"Very Entertaining. I a lot of popular actors. However, the show is flawed in the fact that the writers, producers of this mini-series play out the Egyptian Empire to mimic / ""mirror""  old England and it's Kingdoms' behavior.
The Egyptians had a belief system and culture so different (despite outside influence through trade); and their religion and beliefs in no way was anything like the old European Kings and Queens.
Hollywood once again making the grave mistake using 20th century culture and beliefs in a religion and a world we cannot even begin to understand. Going back to 1332 B.C. (*Cough= Before Christ) would be similar to going to another planet in outer space and trying to understand alien life. It cannot be done!!!!

**Spoilers** For instance; The Egyptian people, especially Pharaohs in no way would even conceptualize much less ""act"" on entertaining taking another queen or woman outside the family blood line... EVER!! Among so many other examples!
I actually laughed because the actress played the same sexual/romantic partner in the ABC TV Show ""Twisted"" using the same two lead actors. (They must be a couple in real life).

7314157,3,B010MJ851Y,"Beautiful sets and costumes. Historically accurate chariots and bows. Light fast chariots were the fast attack weapon of the age. Breeding chariot horses and building chariots, laminated bows, and mixing tin and copper to make bronze weapons were the defense industries of that time. Copper came to Egypt from mines in Timna, Israel or Cyprus. Tin came from mines in the Taruus Mountains of Turkey. I send my compliments to the people who did props, costumes, and sets.

I wanted a more surprising plot with more power games and international intrigue. Tut lived in a more complex age than what we see in this miniseries. Trade by caravan and ship were widespread. The lapis lazuli on Tut's death-mask, around the eyes, came by caravan all the way from Afghanistan. Raiding was common. Most wood used in Egypt was imported from Lebanon from the famous forest of the cedars of Lebanon. The other super power of the Bronze Age was the Hittites with Assyrians and Greeks also powerful.

Yes, the Priests of Amun had become so powerful that they overshadowed the king of Egypt. Tut did not produce an heir, probably because his family was so inbred. They married their sisters to be more like their gods. Very bad plan genetically but a part of their religion. Ay may have been ambitious. He did rule for a brief period after Tut. Ay did marry Ankhesenamun. A seal with their names linked was found. A letter written by Ankhesenamun was found in the Hittite archive asking for a Hittite prince for her to marry and make king of Egypt. He was sent to Egypt and was killed by Egyptian assassins on the way, creating an international incident. General Horemheb was actually a very capable general and leader. As king, he curbed the power of the priests of Amun by appointing priests from the army. Horemheb also reorganized the government to prevent embezzlement by bureaucrats.

The real story is far more interesting and surprising and could inspire a more original plot. Tut must contain and curtail the growing power of the priests of Amun. He must keep Egypt well armed in the face of Greek pirates raiding his tin shipments. A real feel for Bronze Age tech and international intrigue is missing.",1437782400,16,2194,4.783641160949868

I wonder though, there's a part in the story, when two main characters are in the middle of the desert, where did that nice tent came from? They were not carrying anything and their horse had nothing. If they were lucky to find one that was left behind, shouldn't it be a little faded or torn and not so nice?
