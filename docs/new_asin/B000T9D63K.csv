8208210,3,B000T9D63K,A little disappointed in this workout.  It really isn't intense unless you are new to exercise.  Should have done a little more research on the product.,1351382400,2,152,4.8076923076923075
8208211,5,B000T9D63K,"Intense Sculpting (a 22-minute workout with new intermediate flex band exercises) was doable all the way through the first time.  A level 3 type workout, all the exercises are done standing, and many are combination moves where you have to concentrate on doing one thing with your upper body and another with your lower while engaging your core.  The level of intensity and challenge is going to depend a lot on your attention to executing the moves with perfect form and on the resistance of the band. I combined Intense Sculpting with a short stability ball workout for an excellent exercise session which I felt the entire day.  Very highly recommend this as an add-on workout.",1349308800,,680,4.844827586206897
8208212,4,B000T9D63K,"This DVD is a great 40 minute band workout for someone who practices intermediate to advanced pilates.  Moira is very clear on what to do and what muscles you should be working and feeling it in.  It is a great tool to have when I am away from home and my gym. The only thing I would do differently, it make it a little longer!",1265673600,5,327,4.015384615384615
8208213,5,B000T9D63K,"As a certified Stott Pilates instructor, I look for ways to challenge my group classes as they span levels from ""newbie"" to advanced. This was very helpful in bridging some of those gaps.",1259539200,4,187,4.696969696969697
