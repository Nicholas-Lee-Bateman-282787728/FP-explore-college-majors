8757612,1,B01E4NTZUY,The dvd proved to be of a very bad quality due to a collection of old private Cinema recordings. What a pity.,1477440000,5,109,4.0
8757613,2,B01E4NTZUY,"a terriable dvd both video and audio are very poor quality. Being a big fan of Gene Clark is the only reason to buy this piece of trash, It is supposed to be Gene with special guest, Roger McGuinn. but it is actually the opposite. I like McGuinn but ;
this is far more of him than Gene Clark so beware if you do buy this it's big disappointment..",1469664000,7,346,4.028985507246377
