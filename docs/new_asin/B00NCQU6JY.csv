8677439,5,B00NCQU6JY,"The movie is about a failing magician Haruo suddenly making a trip back to the past, meeting his parents when they were young. He has had a grudge against his father as he was told that his father's affairs caused her mother to leave them. However, what he sees in the past is a little different from what he was told. It may be a somewhat sappy story, but the actors do a superb job and it certainly tugs at your heart strings.

The movie carries Japanese subtitles, and the video quality is excellent. (There is no English subtitle.). The bonus material is light -- there are movie trailers and TV spots but there are no interviews.",1430524800,,634,4.418803418803419
