3145647,5,B0015LPRZQ,"this movie truly shows that color is only skin deep. Rachel and Ned came together during two difficult or awkward times in their lives. It is a true eye opener to how fickle one can choose to react to words and peer pressure.

There are some movies that you may choose to add to your collection while there are several movies that will never be considered a collectible. Neo Ned is truly one that should be purchased as it awakens the mind to what we are conditioned to think should not be but then becomes.",1225929600,12,507,4.336842105263158

3145649,5,B0015LPRZQ,"This is a super cute, quirky, romantic movie.  If you're into Jeremy Renner, it's a must see or have.  He is so cute, funny and sad as a lost soul looking for a family, whether it be nazi's or mental patients.  You'd think it'd have a horrible ending given the story, but it's not bad - keep watching and you'll end up with a smile and a new appreciation for the prison system.",1428796800,,377,4.136986301369863

3145653,4,B0015LPRZQ,"This is an unusual character study of two unlikely completely polar opposites  thrown together in a situation that forces them to realize their differences and accept a  growing admiration and affection.

Ned is a ruffian with no home or family. His father is petty crook who never had time for him  and Ned finds himself searching for a place to be probably like how some gang members are today.  He begins an association with the Aryan Nation who teach him of course how to hate everybody, especially and of course Blacks.

His erratic  behavior causes him to be placed in a mental institution where he meets, Rachel, a quirky NOT-QUITE-ALL-THERE  black girl, who for some strange reason thinks that she is the reincarnation  of Adolf Hitler, (yeah I know, the writer was probably reaching in his story line).

She is oddly innocent and sees things through her own mental rose colored glasses.
She and Ned begin an unlikely union and escape the mental institution. They laugh and they love and Ned begins to see that there is a secret pain in this girl and is brought to anger when he finds out what it is.

 Again I  will not spoil it with the epic finalization, but  I should say it took me months to watch this movie and I must have changed the channel a dozen times before I became so bored one morning that I HAD to watch it, and that my friend is how you find little known gems in the movie world.",1419379200,4,1405,4.458823529411765

3145663,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I've seen this movie on television a few years ago but I never had a chance to catch the ending. The movie did leave that much of an impression on me to actually look for it on Amazon and purchase it. I watched it as soon as it arrived and I was totally shocked by the ending. I can't go into detail but let's just say although it was sad, really there was a happiness about it as well. I do like the fact that Ned isn't what he ""THINKS"" he is...he really just wanted to be accepted and have a real family. All in all...2 thumbs up! Of course this is just my critique, if anyone else decides to buy it they may not like it as much as I do.",1397606400,,639,3.8484848484848486
3145664,3,B0015LPRZQ,"Neo Ned (Van Fischer, 2005)

A fun if forgettable little film that is saved from Lifetime Original Moviedom solely by well-above-average performances by the two leads, The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner and 10 Things I Hate About You's Gabrielle Union. Renner plays the title character, a goofy, happy-go-lucky neo-Nazi (yeah, I was wondering about that too) at the opening of the film who is forced to question his beliefs when he finds himself falling for African-American hearttthrob Union. Despite her better judgment, she returns his affection, and the two of them set out to see if they can make a life for themselves despite their obvious fractured beginnings. It is very rare to see white power played for laughs, and any director who's going to attempt it has to be prepared to walk a very fine line; I get the feeling that's one of the reasons why this movie never went much of anywhere, but it seemed to me Van Fischer (Blink of an Eye) did a pretty good job with that aspect of the film, using the comedy aspects of it to keep the movie light while it strayed into some very dark places. It lacks subtlety in a lot of areas, and it pays lip service to American History X a time or two without ever approaching the depth or gravity of that one. Still, as a lightweight  and surprisingly funny film about the redemption of a white-power skinhead, well, it would be pretty hard to do better, if only because it has been so rarely done before. ***",1396828800,2,1452,4.559386973180077
3145665,5,B0015LPRZQ,It came on time no problems with the item at all.  I would recommend it.  I usually don't buy movies but it was cheap and I wanted to see it based on the reviews from others.,1396137600,,174,3.8055555555555554

3145667,5,B0015LPRZQ,"This movie is... well, it almost defies words. Touching, heart-breaking, with little comedic moments thrown in, but even the comedy almost tugs at your heartstrings. There's really no describing it in a way that does it any justice, so I'll just say... If you're looking for a sad, cute love story... This movie is it. Give it a shot.",1394496000,,334,4.677966101694915
3145668,3,B0015LPRZQ,"This CD was okay.  I gave it only a 3 star rating.  I loved the fact that Jeremy Runner, playing the part that he played as a Neo Nazi skin head, became attracted to someone that he never thought he would ever become attracted to which was a black young lady (Gabrielle Union) but what I didn't care for was the fact that they were both mentally off to a certain degree, Jeremy Renner even more so.  I didn't like the way it ended. I wish the story line was based on something else other than them both being in a mental hospital. I'm not sure if I  would recommend this movie or not. It was really kind of silly crazy.",1393200000,,619,4.090909090909091

3145672,4,B0015LPRZQ,Interesting performance by both Gabrielle Union and Jeremy Renner. You have to be really open minded about the subject going into the movie otherwise you may not be able to watch it without be offended at Go! The ending  is really surprising but made a lot of sense if you are following the story from the beginning. I say watch it and judge for yourself :-),1379808000,,358,4.424242424242424

3145676,5,B0015LPRZQ,"I knew I would enjoy this movie because my favorite actor was one of the stars, but I didn't know how beautiful it would be. I LOVED IT. Gabrielle Union & Jeremy Renner were both great (as I knew they would be!) and Ned's love for Rachel was so sweet and I fell in love with his goofiness. I loved the ending-Ned finally has the family he wanted :) GREAT MOVIE!",1362268800,,361,4.098591549295775

3145678,3,B0015LPRZQ,What can I say it's an OK movie.  It's pretty dumb mostly because the girl is capable of intelligent thought and the dude comes of like a moron the entire movie.,1361664000,,161,4.193548387096774
3145679,5,B0015LPRZQ,Wow! All I can say about this DVD is that I had no idea it would be such good dramatic acting from two of my favorite actors.,1360022400,,125,3.6666666666666665
3145680,1,B0015LPRZQ,Very poor quality movie. Stupid content and a lot of prejudice. I don't know how this ever got to a movie version. Thisd should have been banned.,1359504000,2,145,4.407407407407407
3145681,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I really do like Jeremy Renner and wanted to see his early work. However,  the story left me asking a lot of questions. Especially concerning Gabrielle Union's character. I won't go into detail because I do not want to give away the plot.
 All in all it was a good low budget movie.",1357689600,,282,4.30188679245283
3145682,3,B0015LPRZQ,"The premise--a Skinhead/nazi and a black female meet in a psyche hospital and discover love. But, despite the racial issue, race (racial dysfunction) is not what this movie is about. It is about, primarily, NEEDING. These are two people who really NEED.
This is a low budget indy. RENNER portrays a young man who is marred by his EXTREMELY DYSFUNCTIONAL parents. Union portrays a young woman haunted by molestation. Mostly, this movie is CHARACTER DRIVEN. Both do a very good job. RENNER is VERY GOOD as a scared young man pretending to be a TOUGH GUY, looking for a sense of family. UNION is ESPECIALLY GOOD as a young woman, really strong at heart, trying to come to terms with her violated past (she is, also, ESPECIALLY PRETTY). ALSO, there are some short interviews in special features I liked.
It is kinda' hard for me to recommend this movie. I thought it was, as a movie, just OK. I seem to be in the minority here. Mostly, in my opinion, the value in this movie is the historical, cinematic growth of these two actors.",1356220800,,1027,4.586956521739131
3145683,5,B0015LPRZQ,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was interesting to watch it now after Jeremy Renner's career has taken off.  The growth and redemption of the characters was very moving.  The movie deserves all the rewards it received.,1354838400,,223,4.972972972972973
3145684,5,B0015LPRZQ,"This movie was not what I expected. It was surprisingly cute and funny. However, the video quality is lacking. It looks like a movie that was captured then burned or even downloaded. I don't know why the movie looks that way, unless that's the way the movie was intended to look.",1354233600,,279,4.490196078431373
3145685,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I am a fan of Jeremy Renner so I rented this not having the best of expectations.  It was not at all what I thought it was going to be.  It had elements of what I thought, but it was really a quirky yet endearing little love story. I really like the characters especially Ned.  So I bought it and I'm so glad to have it in my film collection.",1351814400,,342,3.857142857142857
3145686,5,B0015LPRZQ,"Yes, the tag line is that a young neo-nazi falls in love with a black woman... I never thought I would want/be able to see tenderness in the eyes of someone wearing a swastika, but there you have it.

The protagonists meet in a mental hospital - they have problems, and may have picked unlikely ways to justify, rationalize, or rather deal with them. This movie takes place beyond judgment - it's not so easy to go there all the way... Gabrielle Union's character sees through his ""I love Hitler"" spiel pretty quickly, and knows it for what it is. As her character is quite depressed, she is not very reactive which probably helps when dealing with someone like Ned, and of course grants him even more of a chance to shine. Jeremy Renner's acting absolutely floored me. From second to second, it is impossible to know where his baffling energy will go; from provocation to simple-mindedness to crushing innocence, to absolute remoteness, child-like wonder and exhilaration, to violence, to joy, to old soul wisdom, to crass ignorance, to a tenderness so deep it (yes) made me forget the nazi paraphernalia. I think I have rarely seen an actor embrace his character to such utter freedom. Kudos go of course to the writers also who didn't shirk from hard issues, without  wallowing in them either.

Was this movie unpolitically correct? Probably. It dealt with life, it didn't fashion an easy happy ending, it put its trust in its viewers' humanity and complexity, yet with the light tone at times of a fable (I believe it would have been different with another musical score...). An unexpected gem.",1351382400,3,1598,4.782608695652174
3145687,4,B0015LPRZQ,"When I read the description of this movie and saw the cover, I was intrigued. The movie itself provides for some meaningful conversation and some laughs(mostly because of Renner), but seriously- a black woman and a neo nazi---falling love? That is a concept I have never even entertained.

The movie gets four stars for me because: 1)It is an original concept, 2) The main actors Gabriele Union and Jeremy Renner were beautiful and crazy, and 3) It's a Code Black film- independent, love it.

I would love to give away details about this one, but I'd rather not. Just see it for yourself, its very good.

Why not the fifth star? Neo Ned could have earned the last star if it was longer and had a more developed plot. It was such a quick movie but I did enjoy it mostly.",1348790400,,769,4.439716312056738
3145688,5,B0015LPRZQ,"Gabrielle Union is always good and she is great in this. Jeremy Renner is wild, over-the-top and totally convincing. Their romance has heat. You think it's going to be a movie about her schooling him, but he brings her back from the brink, too.

The ending is life-affirming, and surprising.",1346457600,3,291,4.82
3145689,5,B0015LPRZQ,"The storyline has already been explained so I will keep it short. I was definitely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Jeremy Renner was fantastic in this. He plays off the wall characters perfectly. Movies like The Avengers don't showcase how great of an actor he is. It was a little tough hearing some of the things he said to Gabrielle Union's character but I felt he portrayed it in a way that made you understand why he acted that way. My favorite part was the scene at the abandoned gas station. The vulnerability they both portrayed was unbelievable. This movie really is not about racism and I hope people give it a chance like I did. I get what people were saying about the ending but I understand why it was written that way. If I could give half stars, I would probably give it 4.5 stars because of the ending.",1344902400,5,829,4.3896103896103895
3145690,1,B0015LPRZQ,You'd think the concept of a 'tard dating a black chick who thinks she's Hitler would have been pure comic genius. lol Not here!,1344556800,4,128,4.375
3145691,5,B0015LPRZQ,Quality of the physical video is good. Quick shipping. Movie was a fair watch for the money. I have never actually heard of this one before but got it cause it looked interesting.,1344211200,,179,4.454545454545454
3145692,4,B0015LPRZQ,"Jeremy Renner can not be beat, the only comparison in his abilities is Edward Norton. This movie is an original quirky love story about two broken people who find love in the strangest of places, a mental institute. A harmless neo-nazi with no self control and an African American woman who is as guarded as one can be due to her past. Strangely they are perfect for one another. Renner gives a performance of a character that is manic and reckless but still remains completely lovable. Union's character is so broken, but even with all her demons she is completely charming. The two, although completely broken, together seem to make a whole person. I have no clue how they pulled this off. This is a purely actor driven movie. It is a good example of the greatness one can find in independent film.",1343088000,2,800,4.601398601398602
3145693,1,B0015LPRZQ,"I viewed this movie and was very upset when I saw how the black woman was depicted in this film, it was not a great film, or love story, just more un-natural sex, I hate race mixing!",1342656000,2,182,3.945945945945946

3145695,3,B0015LPRZQ,The movie kept me interested. I sat down throughout the whole movie even though I was disappointed in the plot of the movie.  I expected it to be different.  The fact that Ned found Rachel attractive did not surprise me or come off as being far fetch.  But there were some disturbing scenes in the movie.  And at the same time there were some brief happy scenes.  The ending was sad but I guess more believable.  And the acting was about average and could have been a little better.  But overall it was entertaining.,1324944000,2,516,4.425531914893617
3145696,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I found this movie under the ""romance/love story"" category and decided to check it out.  I really liked it.  I don't know if it's an indie film or not, but it has that feel.  It also had some decent actors which is a good thing because I doubt highly that lesser actors/actresses could have pulled it off.

""Neo Ned"" is kind of quirky, but it kept my attention and both Jeremy Renner's and Gabrielle Union's performances had me laughing out loud.  A bit sweet, a lot weird and very endearing.",1317859200,3,492,4.4222222222222225
3145697,4,B0015LPRZQ,"This is not unlike ""American X"" in that it deals with a Neo-Nazi who is in an institution for a crime committed against a black man. In this case it's a mental institution as opposed to a prison but the set up is similar.

Here's the scoop. Jeremy Renner has had a rough upbringing, with a father who was in and out of prison and a mom who isn't all there. One group that will except him, and give him a sense of family, are skin heads. Not a good idea. Now he's in a mental ward though he really isn't crazy and he becomes fascinated by a fellow inmate, a black woman, who thinks she's Hitler. She's had her share of hard blows and the two somehow work well together.

Renner is great as Ned. He's kind of goofy. Due to his lousy upbringing he's somewhat naive and doesn't express himself well. But he actually has a lot of spirit. It's just misdirected. Gabrielle Union is also very good. They do a good job of bringing out her natural beauty as opposed to dolling her all up. They are the heart of the picture. This is all writing and acting. No frou frou. It seems most of the money was spent on the cast. It was a real surprise to see Steve Railsback, Sally Kirkland and Cary Elwes in the lineup. The cinematography was very plain. The shots were framed well but the lensing gave it a look only a few steps up from a home movie. I like this as it gave a very natural flavor to everything. Even in it's lackluster appearance you still feel the authority in the directing. This is only Van Fisher's second outing but you'd never know. It's as smooth as silk.

Some might question the ending but I thought it fitting. Both characters go after what is important to them. Renner does it in a weird way but he's happy in the end which is something he's seen little of in his time. I like this movie. It's a good drama that doesn't get too heavy. If you're at all predisposed to this sort of thing, have at it.",1316908800,20,1908,4.193460490463215
3145698,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I liked Gabrielle Union and Jeremy Renner in this. Very unrealistic relationship...a Neo-Nazi skinhead and a black woman, but I enjoyed it. Hated the way it ended though. So I don't spoil it for you, I will just keep my mouth shut about what happened.",1307750400,,251,4.6
3145699,5,B0015LPRZQ,"I liked this movie; the story/plot was a fairly fresh one for interracial love, the question of who's to say WHO is mentally unstable and whether or not they should be committed to inpatient psychiatric care. It offers you the chance to think about those two topics. I can say I was surprised a couple of times at who did what and why. The right actors were chosen for the parts, respectively playing their characters well. This was made by a film company I'm unfamiliar with, and who's budget must have been low.  There were times I wished there were subtitles. Nevertheless this was a pretty good movie that I've viewed more than once.",1303430400,,637,4.587719298245614
3145700,1,B0015LPRZQ,If I could have given it 0 stars then that's what I would have selected.  This movie was HORRIBLE!!  The plot was stupid and it's just terrible.  I normally like Gabrielle Union movies but I give this one a thumbs down.  This must have been when she was just starting out.  I don't know what the other reviewers saw that I didn't.  Glad I just rented it instead of buying it.  Don't waste your time with this movie.,1303430400,5,415,4.243589743589744
3145701,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I watched this whole film on Youtube last night and I will definitely buy it on DVD. I found it absolutely wonderful!! Although I wish it had an alternate ending, I think it's great. Of course, on paper the movie sounds kind of ridiculous but the actual footage is great. Gabrielle Union and Jeremy Renner did amazing jobs and this film deserves props. It's ORIGINAL, which is one of the best things about it. I've never seen a film like this before and although, like I said before, I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, one of the great things about it is that it didn't end the way I expected it to. It's one of the tragic things about it as well! Lol. Overall, it's a great, thought-provoking film and if it weren't for the ending, I'd probably give it 5/5 stars instead of 4/5.",1303257600,,779,4.3061224489795915
3145702,5,B0015LPRZQ,I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this film was.  I think a lot of it had to do with how great the leads were.  They really created characters with depth.  Great acting work.  This is a sweet love story that involves a Nazi skinhead that denounces his ways when he discovers he's falling in love with a black woman.,1301788800,3,325,4.366666666666666
3145703,4,B0015LPRZQ,"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! Don't let the neo-Nazi/Hitler/racist premise scare you off from enjoying a well-written and entertaining character study -- a really solid little piece of cinema. Great performances all around: Jeremy Renner's star is guaranteed to continue rising, as evident in his work as the troubled but likable Ned -- and even Gabrielle Union (who I usually find rather flat, predictable and ultimately uninteresting despite her prettiness) succeeds here as well. Union, thanks to the tight script and adept directing, perhaps puts in the best work of her career. And I agree with another reviewer's observation: there's great chemistry between the two leads, empowering the notion of their characters' profoundly unlikely romance. Overall, the film is at times dark, humorous, genuinely touching and never heavy-handed or unforgivably false.

3145704,5,B0015LPRZQ,"I thoroughly loved this movie, and fortunately the ENTIRE film is posted on Youtube-- I'll be buying it regardless, though. I just finished watching it, and the movie's ending is so bittersweet and selfless that if you don't feel SOME kind of pang, you have the heart of a gargoyle.

I would lapse into a synopsis, but it's been covered pretty accurately by other reviewers. I must say, pairing a skinhead with a black girl who thinks she's Hitler and putting them in a mental hospital is sheer maddened genius.

Gabrielle Union still looks gorgeous sans makeup, even with unkempt hair. Her acting is marvelous, as always. Jeremy Renner's a lovely bit of eye candy, and his acting's quite the bonus. Both characters are screwups, but in a way that says it's okay to be messed up, it's okay to be broken. The acting is superb. Sure, the language is pretty coarse and the sex scene was a bit odd, but overall this is a highly original film in a category all its own. The film is reminiscent of Fight Club, A Bronx Tale, Napoleon Dynamite, and a lot of other things. It's awkward and blunt, in a good way, regarding the performances and the cinematography. It's a shame it wasn't released in theaters.",1289088000,9,1198,4.593457943925234

Why it is possible is because Ned in his heart is not a skin head racist but a scared person who just wants to belong...

He's been displaced most of his life and despite the fact that the girl he falls for goes against everything he supposedly believes in she does something he's been wanting his whole life....acceptance for who he is on the inside and out.

Vice versa for her as well....

Anyway, it is a cute little movie and if one keeps in mind that it is just a movie, you will enjoy it.

Without a family of his own, Ned falls in with the Aryan Brotherhood. Soon after, Ned is placed in a mental hospital where he is mesmerized by a young black girl who believes Adolf Hitler was reincarnated in her. What follows is a gritty character study and poignant love story of two people brought together by a seemingly impossible connection. As a result of that connection, they both find that there is more to a person than what is on the surface. This movie is a little shocking, it's funny and its sad with a bittersweet ending all rolled in one. The acting is awesome.

But Renner (DAHMER) did an AMAZING job on this movie and hit the nail on the head with his portrayal of DYSFUNCTION! I don't think Gabrielle Union was the best choice for the part of Rachel, but I bought the story anyway. Very different, you have probably never seen anything like this!

When I heard that it was a love story between a skinhead and a black woman claiming to be Hitler, I didn't know what to expect.  Definitely not the great acting, intriguing story line, and thought provoking themes.  There were some dark moments, but they only enhanced the overall sense of hope the movie portrayed.  Troubled pasts don't mean a doomed future.  There is love and forgiveness in the most impossible places.  You can learn, grow, and change with the support of another.

I would classify Neo Ned as a romantic comedy that has a wonderful mix of enjoyable, funny scenes, as well as thought provoking moments.

After seeing the film, I find myself wondering what social grudges or generalizations I make on a daily basis. While being lighthearted overall, Neo Ned explores some of the darker aspects of life, helping one to recognize that, despite the past, you do have control over the future. Social stigmas can be overcome regardless of upbringing.

Neo Ned is a film that manages to be highly enjoyable due to a quirky story while analyzing key social issues. Do yourself a favor and give this one a watch, it's worth it.",1231113600,4,799,4.619718309859155
3145717,2,B0015LPRZQ,"First off, I am a black woman. Now, saying that I must say that this movie was ridiculous. I love Gabrielle Union and I also like the guy that played Ned but the plot kills the film because it's too unrealistic for words.

What were the writers thinking? There is no way in the world that a skinhead would ever date a black woman! Skinheads are so consumed with hate and disgust for blacks and other races that I could not believe the writers wrote this film like this. There is no way in the world a skinhead would date a black woman! No way! Also, there is no way in the world that a self-respecting black woman (even if she was supposed to be crazy) would date a skin head!  This is utter nonsense! There is just no way. So since that's the main plot, the film can't be saved from that point of few. Ned would have had to be an ex-skinhead or someone who was far removed from that lifestyle to even look at a black woman even if they were as gorgeous and sexy as Gabrielle Union. There is no, no, no, no way and I can't believe the writers wrote this like this! And Ned was more of a wannabe skinhead anyway. Every time he called Rachel the N word, I held my breath because it didn't fit his character at all. And what black woman would date a white man who called her this word to her face???? Please!!!!

Maybe if the writers had focused on Ned's weakness of being a skinhead or the reason why he was one so we could get a glimpse of him, maybe believing a romance with him and Rachel would work. But the writers didn't delve into anything and these characters were extremely one dimensional. All we know is Ned's a skin head. All we know is Rachel is crazy, was molested and may or may not think she's Hitler!!! What else? We know nothing more about these people! How can you base a film on lead characters that no one knows nothing about! We know nothing about Rachel's upbringing and too much about Ned's. We really don't know why they were together romantically. I got the feeling that Ned wanted to just have sex with Rachel and maybe Rachel was using him to get out the crazy house. But, the writers don't go into anything so we're left clueless!

Aside from that the film has no real plot. Is the plot their romance or them escaping from the mental hospital? I would have rather them stayed in the mental hospital because it was more interesting than watching Ned and Rachel by themselves, especially dealing with such an unrealistic romance that wouldn't happen in a million years.

The acting was very good. I have no complaints there. I am a big fan of Union's and she gets better in each movie. I don't know why she took this obviously low-budget film to be honest. Maybe she and Cary Elwes liked the script. That's the only reason I can see two actors of their calibar and reputation being in this movie. It's obvious it was an independent film going nowhere. The movie is okay just to watch but you cannot take it seriously or really get into it because it's too unrealistic. A skinhead would have probably raped and killed Rachel, not date her.

So, if you want light-hearted entertainment you should check this out. I saw it on Starz for free. I wouldn't pay any money for it. The film is too cheap-looking and besides Union and Elwes it's full of a bunch of no names whose characters fall flat. It's really your choice.",1226620800,15,3340,4.327476038338658

3380150,4,B0015LPRZQ,"This is an unusual character study of two unlikely completely polar opposites  thrown together in a situation that forces them to realize their differences and accept a  growing admiration and affection.

Ned is a ruffian with no home or family. His father is petty crook who never had time for him  and Ned finds himself searching for a place to be probably like how some gang members are today.  He begins an association with the Aryan Nation who teach him of course how to hate everybody, especially and of course Blacks.

His erratic  behavior causes him to be placed in a mental institution where he meets, Rachel, a quirky NOT-QUITE-ALL-THERE  black girl, who for some strange reason thinks that she is the reincarnation  of Adolf Hitler, (yeah I know, the writer was probably reaching in his story line).

She is oddly innocent and sees things through her own mental rose colored glasses.
She and Ned begin an unlikely union and escape the mental institution. They laugh and they love and Ned begins to see that there is a secret pain in this girl and is brought to anger when he finds out what it is.

 Again I  will not spoil it with the epic finalization, but  I should say it took me months to watch this movie and I must have changed the channel a dozen times before I became so bored one morning that I HAD to watch it, and that my friend is how you find little known gems in the movie world.",1419379200,4,1405,4.458823529411765

3380161,3,B0015LPRZQ,"Neo Ned (Van Fischer, 2005)

A fun if forgettable little film that is saved from Lifetime Original Moviedom solely by well-above-average performances by the two leads, The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner and 10 Things I Hate About You's Gabrielle Union. Renner plays the title character, a goofy, happy-go-lucky neo-Nazi (yeah, I was wondering about that too) at the opening of the film who is forced to question his beliefs when he finds himself falling for African-American hearttthrob Union. Despite her better judgment, she returns his affection, and the two of them set out to see if they can make a life for themselves despite their obvious fractured beginnings. It is very rare to see white power played for laughs, and any director who's going to attempt it has to be prepared to walk a very fine line; I get the feeling that's one of the reasons why this movie never went much of anywhere, but it seemed to me Van Fischer (Blink of an Eye) did a pretty good job with that aspect of the film, using the comedy aspects of it to keep the movie light while it strayed into some very dark places. It lacks subtlety in a lot of areas, and it pays lip service to American History X a time or two without ever approaching the depth or gravity of that one. Still, as a lightweight  and surprisingly funny film about the redemption of a white-power skinhead, well, it would be pretty hard to do better, if only because it has been so rarely done before. ***",1396828800,2,1452,4.559386973180077

This is a low budget indy. RENNER portrays a young man who is marred by his EXTREMELY DYSFUNCTIONAL parents. Union portrays a young woman haunted by molestation. Mostly, this movie is CHARACTER DRIVEN. Both do a very good job. RENNER is VERY GOOD as a scared young man pretending to be a TOUGH GUY, looking for a sense of family. UNION is ESPECIALLY GOOD as a young woman, really strong at heart, trying to come to terms with her violated past (she is, also, ESPECIALLY PRETTY). ALSO, there are some short interviews in special features I liked.

The protagonists meet in a mental hospital - they have problems, and may have picked unlikely ways to justify, rationalize, or rather deal with them. This movie takes place beyond judgment - it's not so easy to go there all the way... Gabrielle Union's character sees through his ""I love Hitler"" spiel pretty quickly, and knows it for what it is. As her character is quite depressed, she is not very reactive which probably helps when dealing with someone like Ned, and of course grants him even more of a chance to shine. Jeremy Renner's acting absolutely floored me. From second to second, it is impossible to know where his baffling energy will go; from provocation to simple-mindedness to crushing innocence, to absolute remoteness, child-like wonder and exhilaration, to violence, to joy, to old soul wisdom, to crass ignorance, to a tenderness so deep it (yes) made me forget the nazi paraphernalia. I think I have rarely seen an actor embrace his character to such utter freedom. Kudos go of course to the writers also who didn't shirk from hard issues, without  wallowing in them either.

Was this movie unpolitically correct? Probably. It dealt with life, it didn't fashion an easy happy ending, it put its trust in its viewers' humanity and complexity, yet with the light tone at times of a fable (I believe it would have been different with another musical score...). An unexpected gem.",1351382400,3,1598,4.782608695652174
3380184,4,B0015LPRZQ,"When I read the description of this movie and saw the cover, I was intrigued. The movie itself provides for some meaningful conversation and some laughs(mostly because of Renner), but seriously- a black woman and a neo nazi---falling love? That is a concept I have never even entertained.

The movie gets four stars for me because: 1)It is an original concept, 2) The main actors Gabriele Union and Jeremy Renner were beautiful and crazy, and 3) It's a Code Black film- independent, love it.

I would love to give away details about this one, but I'd rather not. Just see it for yourself, its very good.

Why not the fifth star? Neo Ned could have earned the last star if it was longer and had a more developed plot. It was such a quick movie but I did enjoy it mostly.",1348790400,,769,4.439716312056738
3380185,5,B0015LPRZQ,"Gabrielle Union is always good and she is great in this. Jeremy Renner is wild, over-the-top and totally convincing. Their romance has heat. You think it's going to be a movie about her schooling him, but he brings her back from the brink, too.

The ending is life-affirming, and surprising.",1346457600,3,291,4.82
3380186,5,B0015LPRZQ,"The storyline has already been explained so I will keep it short. I was definitely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Jeremy Renner was fantastic in this. He plays off the wall characters perfectly. Movies like The Avengers don't showcase how great of an actor he is. It was a little tough hearing some of the things he said to Gabrielle Union's character but I felt he portrayed it in a way that made you understand why he acted that way. My favorite part was the scene at the abandoned gas station. The vulnerability they both portrayed was unbelievable. This movie really is not about racism and I hope people give it a chance like I did. I get what people were saying about the ending but I understand why it was written that way. If I could give half stars, I would probably give it 4.5 stars because of the ending.",1344902400,5,829,4.3896103896103895

3380189,4,B0015LPRZQ,"Jeremy Renner can not be beat, the only comparison in his abilities is Edward Norton. This movie is an original quirky love story about two broken people who find love in the strangest of places, a mental institute. A harmless neo-nazi with no self control and an African American woman who is as guarded as one can be due to her past. Strangely they are perfect for one another. Renner gives a performance of a character that is manic and reckless but still remains completely lovable. Union's character is so broken, but even with all her demons she is completely charming. The two, although completely broken, together seem to make a whole person. I have no clue how they pulled this off. This is a purely actor driven movie. It is a good example of the greatness one can find in independent film.",1343088000,2,800,4.601398601398602

3380192,3,B0015LPRZQ,The movie kept me interested. I sat down throughout the whole movie even though I was disappointed in the plot of the movie.  I expected it to be different.  The fact that Ned found Rachel attractive did not surprise me or come off as being far fetch.  But there were some disturbing scenes in the movie.  And at the same time there were some brief happy scenes.  The ending was sad but I guess more believable.  And the acting was about average and could have been a little better.  But overall it was entertaining.,1324944000,2,516,4.425531914893617
3380193,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I found this movie under the ""romance/love story"" category and decided to check it out.  I really liked it.  I don't know if it's an indie film or not, but it has that feel.  It also had some decent actors which is a good thing because I doubt highly that lesser actors/actresses could have pulled it off.

""Neo Ned"" is kind of quirky, but it kept my attention and both Jeremy Renner's and Gabrielle Union's performances had me laughing out loud.  A bit sweet, a lot weird and very endearing.",1317859200,3,492,4.4222222222222225
3380194,4,B0015LPRZQ,"This is not unlike ""American X"" in that it deals with a Neo-Nazi who is in an institution for a crime committed against a black man. In this case it's a mental institution as opposed to a prison but the set up is similar.

Here's the scoop. Jeremy Renner has had a rough upbringing, with a father who was in and out of prison and a mom who isn't all there. One group that will except him, and give him a sense of family, are skin heads. Not a good idea. Now he's in a mental ward though he really isn't crazy and he becomes fascinated by a fellow inmate, a black woman, who thinks she's Hitler. She's had her share of hard blows and the two somehow work well together.

Renner is great as Ned. He's kind of goofy. Due to his lousy upbringing he's somewhat naive and doesn't express himself well. But he actually has a lot of spirit. It's just misdirected. Gabrielle Union is also very good. They do a good job of bringing out her natural beauty as opposed to dolling her all up. They are the heart of the picture. This is all writing and acting. No frou frou. It seems most of the money was spent on the cast. It was a real surprise to see Steve Railsback, Sally Kirkland and Cary Elwes in the lineup. The cinematography was very plain. The shots were framed well but the lensing gave it a look only a few steps up from a home movie. I like this as it gave a very natural flavor to everything. Even in it's lackluster appearance you still feel the authority in the directing. This is only Van Fisher's second outing but you'd never know. It's as smooth as silk.

Some might question the ending but I thought it fitting. Both characters go after what is important to them. Renner does it in a weird way but he's happy in the end which is something he's seen little of in his time. I like this movie. It's a good drama that doesn't get too heavy. If you're at all predisposed to this sort of thing, have at it.",1316908800,20,1908,4.193460490463215
3380195,4,B0015LPRZQ,"I liked Gabrielle Union and Jeremy Renner in this. Very unrealistic relationship...a Neo-Nazi skinhead and a black woman, but I enjoyed it. Hated the way it ended though. So I don't spoil it for you, I will just keep my mouth shut about what happened.",1307750400,,251,4.6
3380196,5,B0015LPRZQ,"I liked this movie; the story/plot was a fairly fresh one for interracial love, the question of who's to say WHO is mentally unstable and whether or not they should be committed to inpatient psychiatric care. It offers you the chance to think about those two topics. I can say I was surprised a couple of times at who did what and why. The right actors were chosen for the parts, respectively playing their characters well. This was made by a film company I'm unfamiliar with, and who's budget must have been low.  There were times I wished there were subtitles. Nevertheless this was a pretty good movie that I've viewed more than once.",1303430400,,637,4.587719298245614

Glad I just rented it instead of buying it.  Don't waste your time with this movie.,1303430400,5,415,4.243589743589744

Although I wish it had an alternate ending, I think it's great. Of course, on paper the movie sounds kind of ridiculous but the actual footage is great. Gabrielle Union and Jeremy Renner did amazing jobs and this film deserves props. It's ORIGINAL, which is one of the best things about it. I've never seen a film like this before and although, like I said before, I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, one of the great things about it is that it didn't end the way I expected it to. It's one of the tragic things about it as well! Lol. Overall, it's a great, thought-provoking film and if it weren't for the ending, I'd probably give it 5/5 stars instead of 4/5.",1303257600,,779,4.3061224489795915
3380199,5,B0015LPRZQ,I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this film was.  I think a lot of it had to do with how great the leads were.  They really created characters with depth.  Great acting work.  This is a sweet love story that involves a Nazi skinhead that denounces his ways when he discovers he's falling in love with a black woman.,1301788800,3,325,4.366666666666666
3380200,4,B0015LPRZQ,"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! Don't let the neo-Nazi/Hitler/racist premise scare you off from enjoying a well-written and entertaining character study -- a really solid little piece of cinema. Great performances all around: Jeremy Renner's star is guaranteed to continue rising, as evident in his work as the troubled but likable Ned -- and even Gabrielle Union (who I usually find rather flat, predictable and ultimately uninteresting despite her prettiness) succeeds here as well. Union, thanks to the tight script and adept directing, perhaps puts in the best work of her career. And I agree with another reviewer's observation: there's great chemistry between the two leads, empowering the notion of their characters' profoundly unlikely romance. Overall, the film is at times dark, humorous, genuinely touching and never heavy-handed or unforgivably false. I consider Neo Ned a more insightful, true and telling treatise on racism in America than 2009's laughable and embarrassing The Blind Side. I highly recommend Neo Ned!",1290297600,2,1030,5.484276729559748
3380201,5,B0015LPRZQ,"I thoroughly loved this movie, and fortunately the ENTIRE film is posted on Youtube-- I'll be buying it regardless, though. I just finished watching it, and the movie's ending is so bittersweet and selfless that if you don't feel SOME kind of pang, you have the heart of a gargoyle.

I would lapse into a synopsis, but it's been covered pretty accurately by other reviewers. I must say, pairing a skinhead with a black girl who thinks she's Hitler and putting them in a mental hospital is sheer maddened genius.

Gabrielle Union still looks gorgeous sans makeup, even with unkempt hair. Her acting is marvelous, as always. Jeremy Renner's a lovely bit of eye candy, and his acting's quite the bonus. Both characters are screwups, but in a way that says it's okay to be messed up, it's okay to be broken. The acting is superb. Sure, the language is pretty coarse and the sex scene was a bit odd, but overall this is a highly original film in a category all its own. The film is reminiscent of Fight Club, A Bronx Tale, Napoleon Dynamite, and a lot of other things. It's awkward and blunt, in a good way, regarding the performances and the cinematography. It's a shame it wasn't released in theaters.",1289088000,9,1198,4.593457943925234

3380205,4,B0015LPRZQ,"What can I say, but ""stranger"" or the more appropriate word for this film would be ""crazier"" things have happened and yes it is possible that a ""wanna be"" skinhead and a black woman to fall in love...

Why it is possible is because Ned in his heart is not a skin head racist but a scared person who just wants to belong...

He's been displaced most of his life and despite the fact that the girl he falls for goes against everything he supposedly believes in she does something he's been wanting his whole life....acceptance for who he is on the inside and out.

Vice versa for her as well....

Anyway, it is a cute little movie and if one keeps in mind that it is just a movie, you will enjoy it.

Highly recommend!",1267747200,42,716,4.235294117647059
3380206,5,B0015LPRZQ,"Like most kids, Ned idolized his father and dreamed of following in his footsteps. Unfortunately, his father was a two-bit crook who spent most of his life in jail. Without a family of his own, Ned falls in with the Aryan Brotherhood. Soon after, Ned is placed in a mental hospital where he is mesmerized by a young black girl who believes Adolf Hitler was reincarnated in her. What follows is a gritty character study and poignant love story of two people brought together by a seemingly impossible connection. As a result of that connection, they both find that there is more to a person than what is on the surface. This movie is a little shocking, it's funny and its sad with a bittersweet ending all rolled in one. The acting is awesome.

I actually had NO clue what it was about before I saw it so as the plot unfolded, I was saying to myself, What the Hell?? But Renner (DAHMER) did an AMAZING job on this movie and hit the nail on the head with his portrayal of DYSFUNCTION! I don't think Gabrielle Union was the best choice for the part of Rachel, but I bought the story anyway. Very different, you have probably never seen anything like this! It takes dysfunction to a whoooooole different level, but brings it close to home. We ALL know a NED and a Rachel!! You will fall in love with the characters' 'scars'.",1241049600,4,692,4.4140625

Definitely not the great acting, intriguing story line, and thought provoking themes.  There were some dark moments, but they only enhanced the overall sense of hope the movie portrayed.  Troubled pasts don't mean a doomed future.  There is love and forgiveness in the most impossible places.  You can learn, grow, and change with the support of another.

3380213,5,B0015LPRZQ,"To preface this review, I spend a lot of time watching movies. I love films that take a different perspective on life, films that get me to think. I would classify Neo Ned as a romantic comedy that has a wonderful mix of enjoyable, funny scenes, as well as thought provoking moments.

After seeing the film, I find myself wondering what social grudges or generalizations I make on a daily basis. While being lighthearted overall, Neo Ned explores some of the darker aspects of life, helping one to recognize that, despite the past, you do have control over the future. Social stigmas can be overcome regardless of upbringing.

Neo Ned is a film that manages to be highly enjoyable due to a quirky story while analyzing key social issues. Do yourself a favor and give this one a watch, it's worth it.",1231113600,4,799,4.619718309859155
3380214,2,B0015LPRZQ,"First off, I am a black woman. Now, saying that I must say that this movie was ridiculous. I love Gabrielle Union and I also like the guy that played Ned but the plot kills the film because it's too unrealistic for words.

What were the writers thinking? There is no way in the world that a skinhead would ever date a black woman! Skinheads are so consumed with hate and disgust for blacks and other races that I could not believe the writers wrote this film like this. There is no way in the world a skinhead would date a black woman! No way! Also, there is no way in the world that a self-respecting black woman (even if she was supposed to be crazy) would date a skin head!  This is utter nonsense! There is just no way. So since that's the main plot, the film can't be saved from that point of few. Ned would have had to be an ex-skinhead or someone who was far removed from that lifestyle to even look at a black woman even if they were as gorgeous and sexy as Gabrielle Union. There is no, no, no, no way and I can't believe the writers wrote this like this! And Ned was more of a wannabe skinhead anyway. Every time he called Rachel the N word, I held my breath because it didn't fit his character at all. And what black woman would date a white man who called her this word to her face???? Please!!!!

Maybe if the writers had focused on Ned's weakness of being a skinhead or the reason why he was one so we could get a glimpse of him, maybe believing a romance with him and Rachel would work. But the writers didn't delve into anything and these characters were extremely one dimensional. All we know is Ned's a skin head. All we know is Rachel is crazy, was molested and may or may not think she's Hitler!!! What else? We know nothing more about these people! How can you base a film on lead characters that no one knows nothing about! We know nothing about Rachel's upbringing and too much about Ned's. We really don't know why they were together romantically. I got the feeling that Ned wanted to just have sex with Rachel and maybe Rachel was using him to get out the crazy house. But, the writers don't go into anything so we're left clueless!

Aside from that the film has no real plot. Is the plot their romance or them escaping from the mental hospital? I would have rather them stayed in the mental hospital because it was more interesting than watching Ned and Rachel by themselves, especially dealing with such an unrealistic romance that wouldn't happen in a million years.

The acting was very good. I have no complaints there. I am a big fan of Union's and she gets better in each movie. I don't know why she took this obviously low-budget film to be honest. Maybe she and Cary Elwes liked the script. That's the only reason I can see two actors of their calibar and reputation being in this movie. It's obvious it was an independent film going nowhere. The movie is okay just to watch but you cannot take it seriously or really get into it because it's too unrealistic. A skinhead would have probably raped and killed Rachel, not date her.

So, if you want light-hearted entertainment you should check this out. I saw it on Starz for free. I wouldn't pay any money for it. The film is too cheap-looking and besides Union and Elwes it's full of a bunch of no names whose characters fall flat. It's really your choice.",1226620800,15,3340,4.327476038338658
