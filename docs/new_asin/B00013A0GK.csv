1968625,5,B00013A0GK,"This DVD Makes me... well, HAPPY.
Really, the routines are so nice.  They flow really well. Eoin's voice is calming and doesn't make me feel like I need to overdo it.
I love the ""Magically Hips"" Routine in particular. It really makes me feel open and alive.  As Eion says in the commentary, ""when your hips loosen up, it makes you feel younger and more vital""
I think this DVD is great for losing weight too. It is challenging, but the pace is not so fast that I couln't keep up.
The people really look like they are having fun (I thought you had to be more serious when you did Yoga)and there is just such a feeling of positivity that runs through it.
It is a unique product and I can not say that I own a Yoga or Fitness DVD that I have enjoyed more.  It is my new favorite!",1075334400,14,776,4.092105263157895
1968626,5,B00013A0GK,"Vancouver yoga teacher Eoin Finn is a favorite among video fitness enthusiasts for his first effort,  Power Yoga by Eoin Finn.  His second work features some very well thought out elements that are geared specifically towards the video yogi and yogini, along with a relaxed and playful vibe, beautiful settings and soothing music.  This is a two (2!) CD set that features several routines from 30-90 minutes of vinyasa yoga.  The instruction is a voice over by Eion, with Eion and other models showing modifications for beginners, intermediates and ""double black diamonds"", or advanced versions of asanas.
For lovers of vinyasa style yoga, this CD offers a lot of variety, from the 30 minute Yoga Quickie, to a hip-opening routine entitled Magically Hips, to a challenging 90 minute, Full Happiness routine.  This video does assume the user's basic knowledge of vinyasa style yoga, but again, basic modifications are plentiful and easy to find, as are more advanced poses such as Tittibasana and the jaw-dropper Eka Pada Galavasana.
Eion's sense of humour is irrepressible, whether featuring a canine member of the cast with his own purple sticky mat, to the chapter points that describe Sun Salutations ""eh"" and ""B"" (the group is from Canada).  For me, this is a refreshing change from the rather rarified quality of so many other videos on the market today.  And the routine is just great, a wonderful balance of strength and stretch for the top of your head to the bottom of your feet.
The only thing missing from this fantastic CD is a ""zen"" soundtrack that was originally planned--a soundtrack that features minimal description and basic cuing, a great option once you are familiar with the poses and the flow of the routines.  No biggie, though, as it is very good to hear the things that Eoin has to say.
All in all, a great DVD, one that I know I will be reaching for again and again.",1074816000,54,1892,4.817901234567901
1968636,4,B00013A0GK,"I discovered Eoin Finn through his free podcasts, of which there are 8 that can be downloaded from iTunes. The podcasts cover a range of about 6 years. Eoin's skill as a teacher and prowess as a yogi has grown quite a bit over the past six years. I find the same is true with his DVDs. The first one I bought is the most recent: Power Yoga For Happiness II The Surf Edition. After owning that for a month, I bought this one, Power Yoga For Happiness.
It is a good, solid workout. If you love vinyasa yoga/power yoga, you'll probably like this DVD. For me, it was good and solid, but didn't contain any of the really funky variations of his later work.
And for clarity purposes, there is one workout on this DVD. It's 80 minutes long. All the other workouts are different chapters of the main workout put together with certain things left out to make shorter flows.
The thing I love about Eoin is that he is just so filled with love, playfulness and joy. That comes through in this DVD, but it comes through even more in Power Yoga For Happiness II The Surf Edition. If you could only have one, and you're pretty fit and love to work hard in your yoga practice, save your money for The Surf Edition.",1222041600,9,1198,4.28193832599119
1968637,5,B00013A0GK,"It's filmed in a beautiful forest park setting outdoors and has a calming yet playful vibe to it with soothing music in the background and Eoin doing a calming, encouraging and even fun voice over. It's so refreshing! It's a great power yoga flowing practice with a  good amount of vinyasa's throughout to get you sweating and pumped. This practice flows so there will not be any breaks in the routine to explain the postures (it's not for true beginners). There are even some really nice hand balancing poses sprinkled throughout to work towards so intermediates can continue to grow into. It's a wonderfully balanced power yoga practice. It will get your upper body strong, your lower body strong, with an all over top to bottom stretching, strengthening, lengthening and opening -- Eoin doesn't leave anything out. It's just awesome! It's fun and calming and will keep you challenged and growing without being too beyond you to leave you frustrated. It will leave you happy and glowing with a big smile on your face! : )) Also check out his latest DVD release ""Power Yoga for Happiness 2"" [Other Recommended Power Yoga DVDs: Yogatopia; Yoga Radiance; Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti and also her Fluid Power Vinyasa Flow Yoga; Bryan Kest's Energize, Tone and Sweat; Yoga Zone's Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance; MTV's Power Yoga, Adrienne Reed's Power Yoga for Athletes and her other Power Yoga Fat Burner; Flow Yoga with Jennifer Lynn; Ease Into Ashtanga with Yoga Hawaii (see their website for video clips); Flow and Yin: A Balanced Yoga Practice with Donna Helm-Yost; Vinyasa Flow Yoga Simple and Sweet with Jennifer Tipton also Vinyasa Flow Yoga Intermediate & Advanced with Maral Hadidi (see their [...] site for videoclips, they also have some other nice DVD's in the series you can get at Amazon).]",1220745600,2,1805,4.918032786885246
1968638,5,B00013A0GK,"I bought this DVD reluctantly, thinking I'd watch it a couple times.  I fell in love with it.  I've made so much progress, I'm now doing the advanced poses.  I am definitely more flexible and have gained strength.  Each time I do it, I get better and learn/feel something new.  Some days I do the quickie 30 minute practice and then other days when I have more time, I do one of the longer sessions.  At first I though the commentary was kind of cheesy but to be honest, I really enjoy the cheesiness...it makes me feel calm, happy and relaxed.  I would highly recommend this video.",1204934400,3,582,4.383177570093458
1968639,5,B00013A0GK,"Love this dvd compilation. Several options to choose from, 2 disks so that's great especially for those days where you don't have much time, but still want to get something in to ease your mind.  I love the setting (in beautiful BC in a lush green park), and the background music works perfectly (not annoying)... the participants on screen are all at different levels, which is pretty cool to see (if you're watching the screen)!  Made my husband feel good about himself when he tried it, seeing that he was better than the one guy who has (very little) flexibility!!!

Eoin has a quirky sense of humor, but I think that's his appeal.. ya sure, maybe it's a little cheesy, but it perks me up and his voice is relaxing.  This is 'power yoga' so the Vinyasa style is quick- I think it's wise for beginners (or anyone) to watch the dvd once over before doing the workout anyway.  Definitely does the trick, calms the mind and tones the body as well.  My favorite workout is 'Strong Free & Happy'- challenging, and just the right length of time (53min).  'Full Happiness' is awesome too, but I don't always have 80min as the mom of a rambunctious toddler!  The 'quickie' is great too when I just want to get some yoga happiness into a busy day, even if it's not very long (30 min).

If you do the 'Full Happiness' workout, you will be exposed to all of the key postures, and there will be no surprises when you try the other workout options.  I guess that could be a criticism since all the workouts are essentially the same one, broken down into different length segments (same voice-over, same cueing, same background music).  That doesn't bother me however, because I like the familiarity and find the combination right on the way it is.

All this to say that it is wonderful.  I highly recommend it to anyone!",1197158400,2,1810,4.515337423312883
1968640,4,B00013A0GK,"I like the workouts and feel good doing this workout - however Finn is a bit of a hippy, flaky, peace, love, and all that instructor. I wish he would talk less about loving and more about form and what muscles you are working - More fitness less philosophy. Once you get past his quirky personality it is a great workout and I do the tape frequently, not sure that i will buy more though.",1194220800,,388,4.1866666666666665
1968641,3,B00013A0GK,"Well, I guess I like this DVD.

It helps losen my hips and stretched, and everything I would look for in a Yoga class. I also don't mind how fast they go because that helps bringing my heart rate up.  But I'm so not into whatever he says. It makes me laugh and stares at the TV, ""what the...""

I guess that's his style. If you know what I'm talking about and still likes him, then this is a great yoga exercise DVD.",1188950400,3,415,3.9759036144578315
1968642,5,B00013A0GK,"Although I go to a studio run by a Baron Baptiste-trained instructor, this is the best yoga DVD I've ever bought, and the only one I enjoy doing consistently.  It's not as intense or advanced as a hot yoga session, but the focus on breathing is amazing and some intermediate/advanced arm balancing poses spice things up a bit.",1184889600,,326,4.620689655172414
1968643,5,B00013A0GK,This is one of my FAVORITE yoga dvds.  I like the premix options that offer a shorter practice.  Different variations for beginners to advanced yoginis are demonstrated.  I do this DVD on a weekly basis.,1176422400,,203,4.742857142857143
1968644,5,B00013A0GK,"Eoin Finn does a great job with this dvd. The music is great, the flow is right on. The best part of this workout is Eoin's emphasis on positivity and joy. I think his commentary is just the right amount, and the pace is gentle and accessible. For the reviewer who thought the pace was too fast, this is vinyasa yoga, not Iyengar. There are different styles of yoga...none better or worse than the other, just different. I am a 40 y.o. woman and had no problems keeping up.",1172016000,,473,4.325842696629214
1968645,3,B00013A0GK,"My wife and I did the ""Magically Hips"" routine first, which is very nice and has certainly helped loosen up my hips. However, Finn has a bad habit of interrupting a workout to show off.

For instance, in the ""Strong, Free and Happy"" routine on the second DVD, he does this thing with his knees and his hands behind his back which I can't really figure out. It might be possible to figure it out if he didn't rush on to the advanced or intermediate versions (and apparently beyond). But he does. It might also be possible to figure out if the camera showed someone besides Finn doing it. But it doesn't. This sequence  really destroys the mood for me--if the instructor in my first yoga class had gone in for that sort of thing I wouldn't practice yoga at all.

We did get a good laugh out of the dog which shows up occasionally during some of the upward dog/downward dog sequences, and like I said I am really fond of ""Magically Hips.""",1171843200,6,935,4.362068965517241
1968646,4,B00013A0GK,"I think this is a great workout.  I always feel great after I do it.  It has enough different poses that I feel like I get a good and varied workout. And I like that it has several length options all in one set.  Eion says some funny things like ""focus your Ghandi lazer"" but I can overlook all that because I like the workout so much.  And most of his sayings make me smile anyway.  I always recommend this one when someone asks about yoga workouts.",1167782400,3,450,4.126436781609195

I train in Yoga since about six Years. I practice every day.

Also I teach Power Yoga in a local Hotel Spa Fitness Studio.

Since I'm german my english spelling is bad news, sorry for that!

About the DVD:

It is defently a good buy if you look for a complete Power Yoga programm challanging strength and Flexibility.

There is a lot of stuff on the DVD.

It is very Challanging and I would recommend it only for physically strong, advanced Practicioners.

Viewing the DVD you shouldn't be distracted by sceens like the Yoga Practicioners hugging each other extensivly. ;-) There is realy truly a lot of Happyness and Love in the DVD. It might be a little to much, but the workouts are good. There are some pretty advanced variations, but nobody needs to go that far.

I personnaly feel that Eoins Skills are not as high as some of the other Teachers that I saw on DVD. He is strong and does some advanced mooves, but his basics are sometimes not so fluid and sure as you see it with Great Teachers like Shiva Rea and Baron Baptiste. After all, that is not so important for someone who uses the DVD for Training. I liked it, it challanges me, I recommend it.

1968648,5,B00013A0GK,"I own quite a few yoga DVDs now, and this is my favourite. Partly because of the relaxed happy style in which it was produced, and partly because of the range of practices available. As one reviewer said, the vinyasas between poses are a bit fast for my liking, but you can always pause the DVD. The tragically/magically hips section is excellent; you will feel great afterwards. A range of people showing modifications helps. Nice garden scenery as a relaxing backdrop. If like me, you don't like too much navel gazing interfering with your yoga, this is just the right touch.",1159660800,2,577,4.7227722772277225
1968649,5,B00013A0GK,"This is a wonderful tape - with all levels of difficulty.  I never get bored.  It provides a fantastic workout, a spiritual workout - and makes me smile all at the same time.",1149552000,,174,4.242424242424242
1968650,5,B00013A0GK,"I have only done three of the practices offered on the dvd and I have enjoyed them all. I love the variety offered with this DVD.

I consider myself an intermediate practioner and found I can do most of the poses. I think a beginner would find these practices too difficult. I enjoy Eoin Finn's style of teaching and the pace of his class.",1142985600,,339,4.296875
1968651,5,B00013A0GK,"I've had this yoga DVD for about a year and I am finally writing a review because it has turned out to be one of my best yoga DVD's out of a really huge collection.  It really gives you great value, you can keep returning to it and increasing your overall state of health, and your strength, balance and best of all your energy will continue to grow as you keep coming back to it.

It offers 2 full DVD's of a power yoga, vinyasa flow routine that is cut up into different versions.  Unlike other DVD's that try to do this kind of thing each version is really well balanced and will stretch you out and make you feel great.  There's 1) 30 min. routine ""quickie"" 2) 40 min. ""daily dose of bliss"" 3) 55 min. ""magically hips"" 4) 53 min ""strong,happy and free"" and 5) the full 80 min. ""total happiness"" version.  The beautiful outdoor location w/grass and trees in Vancouver and the friendly, fun, and calm demeanor of Eoin and the other practitioners give you a whole range of choices so that you really will get a great, balanced, strenthening, toning, flexibility-improving workout every single time.  Within each version he offers about three different options for the more difficult poses so that you can keep returning to this DVD set and getting improvement, or doing the quick version on a day when you don't have a lot of time or energy but still want great benefits.  You do continue growing and getting stronger and more fit as you use these DVD's so it is really a program that keeps on giving.

Don't get me wrong, it is five versions of the same routine so unlike ""Yoga Shakti"" by Shiva Rea you don't have that amount of differences, but this is not another static DVD that you can only use as a beginner or once you are already super-fit.  It's a wonderful DVD set.  I hope people keep enjoying this.  Highly recommended!",1136505600,4,1832,4.455089820359281
1968652,5,B00013A0GK,"I really enjoy this DVD.  It follows Ashtanga Yoga with lots of vinyasas and a faster flow.  If you are into Ashtanga or Vinyasa yoga then this is a great DVD for you to try!  I think Eoin is a good teacher- good cues and direction on form and also very motivational!  Although there are 5 different workouts on 2 DVDs it is really the same workout- the shorter versions just have a lot of poses removed.  Yoga Shakti by Shiva Rea is still my favorite yoga DVD, but this is a good one too, and I'm really glad I own it.",1135987200,,519,4.049019607843137
1968653,5,B00013A0GK,"I'm not a touchy-feely person, but I find the positive, surfer-esque, ""do-what-feels-good"" energy of this DVD very inspiring, and do the 50-minute workout on a regular basis. It's challenging, but not impossible, with a nice variety of postures. Eoin is a gentle, charismatic (not to mention great-looking!) teacher.

I like to vary my practice depending on how I feel on any given day -- energy level, soreness, time, etc. -- so I like the range of practice lengths and appreciate the fact that people of differing yoga abilities are shown to illustrate variations on the postures.

The group-hugging during the final credits is a little too cult-ish and weird for my taste, but, hey, it's a small price to pay; by that time I'm feeling so chill and limber and strong that I don't care what's happening onscreen. Anyway, who wouldn't want to hug Eoin given the chance?",1128384000,,869,4.864864864864865

1968655,5,B00013A0GK,"I found this yoga DVD was a refreshing departure from the mass of generic ones out there.  The tone Eoin Finn creates is light, humorous and positive, and the quality of the yoga is definitely there as well. The pace of the poses is more of a flow routine, which I like because I've found my physical conditioning has improved alot since using it. I've tended to get bored quickly with other ones I've bought, but this one has managed to keep my interest (the amount of variety and content over the two discs definitely helps with this). Where did they film this? It's beautiful!",1121299200,2,579,4.514285714285714

He is a great instructor, and I find him inspiring.  He has a great philosophy, and will make you a better yogi and maybe even a better person.",1116115200,11,347,4.548387096774194
1968657,5,B00013A0GK,"Warning: This practice will make you smile, laugh, and generaly feel happy. Lighten Up!

I'll make this short and sweet (as Eion would say). This DVD is a great bargain with all of the practices you get. Allbeit they are splicings of the same workout with some new stuff thrown in, but you still get a terrific variety to choose from to fit your ""Yoga Mood"" for the day.

This practice is for the light-hearted that don't mind breaking their concentration every once-in-a-while to crack a smile. Yoga is meant to be fun and enjoyable and Eion is the only instructor I've found on DVD that allows you to have that mentality. OK, he's a little sticky-sweet sometimes... ""This pose should feel like having ice cream licked off your body"", but I laugh and relax into the pose more. Wouldn't you know it, it does feel better, maybe not ice cream licked off my body, but better.

1968659,4,B00013A0GK,"I have been practicing yoga for about three years -- mostly going to classes at various studios and doing the occasional Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss at Home which has just gotten to be too easy...not challenging enough. I bought Power Yoga for Happiness because a friend had previously passed on Eoin Finn's free audio downloads of his class. This is a great video for the home practitioner who is looking to move into something more challenging and fun than the beginner yoga workouts. Why? Well, because for one thing it's not easy! On the other hand, it's not impossible and you can actually grow with this practice. He gives instruction on each pose for beginners and advanced. So you start with doing what you can, and he leads you step by step into a more advanced version of each pose. The length of the workouts means you can make the video more like a full studio class 1x a week and supplement with his ""Quickie"" every morning. Be aware that the DVD's do skip in my DVD player (hence the four stars), but play perfectly on my Xbox, Playstation or computer. I think it has something to do with the anti-copying device and that my DVD player is old. And yes, all the version's are cut up's of the full studio class, but despite the 'problems', Power Yoga for Happiness continues to be the best Yoga DVD to grow a practice at home, and one that I haven't gotten bored with after five months!",1109721600,11,1404,4.509803921568627

It seems sincere and real, and when it is a little over the top it makes me smile. Not such a bad thing. The workout is wonderful, well-instructed with good modifications and now a favorite of this advanced-beginner. I appreciate the sessions of different length, with various foci. It does not bother me that the basics are repeated - that is what yoga practice is about. There are core asanas that should be practiced regularly. The dvd contains sessions of 30, 40, 53 (strength emphasis), 55 (hip opening emphasis) and the Full Happiness 80 minute session. Each is a little different, but the basics are always there.

I especially enjoy having the ability to choose the length of my workout.  On days where I'm crunched for time I choose the 40 minute segment.  If my hips hurt, I choose ""Magically Hips"" for a 55 minute routine.  Yes, the shorter workouts are edited down versions of the full routine--but that is okay.

1968664,2,B00013A0GK,"I guess I asked for it since I purchased this DVD ""Power Yoga"". If you want to do American Yoga...fast,fast,fast...then this is the practice for you. For me, Eoin progresses thru the poses way too fast and with urgency in his voice. He barely pauses in between poses and you never really makes a mind/body connection. If you just want to burn and sweat, this power yoga is for you (and they smile a lot). The scenery is beautiful and the people make it interesting, but it wasn't for me.
I've tried his routine several times, but I always turn it off part way through -- he irritates me more than anything. It could be considered a good buy because it includes 2 DVDs. It has many different lengths of workouts, but these different workouts are just cut and spliced, so they're not really different styles or performances.
If you want a real challenging Yoga experience where you can practice and learn mind/body/breath connections, I would suggest Kripalu Yoga DVD instead. And, like the other person suggests, Yoga for Surfers is wonderful...

8005830,5,B00013A0GK,"This practice is a great compilation.  It was my first encounter with Eoin, and I fell in love with him.
I've been practicing yoga for about 7 years, and I'm very picky about instructors and practices.  This one met my very strict standards for several reasons.  It truly is appropriate for all ability levels.  Whether I'm looking to challenge myself or experience a very light, soothing session I can follow this sequence.  Eoin is very soothing and encouraging.  His cuing is spot-on and in several cases showed me a new way of looking at some of the poses.  A few of the things he says are really unusual (like when he says ""it should feel like you're getting ice cream licked off your body"" in pigeon).  Typically that would distract me but, it works with Eoin and just makes me smile and enjoy the experience even more.
The two discs offer selections from the full routine.  I love the ""quickie;"" it's only 30 minutes and is a perfect end to my day.  ""Strong, free, and happy"" is another favorite that challenges and energizes me.
This video truly is ""for happiness.""  The setting is beautiful, and you really feel like you are actually practicing with a group of friends.  I love seeing the participants on the screen smiling, having fun, and looking like they understand what yoga really is all about.  When they all get off of their mats and hug each other at the end it's like I'm right there with them!
Soon after purchasing this video I couldn't help myself:  I had to order Power Yoga for Happiness 2.  They are both excellent practices that are valuable additions to any collection.  The second is probably a bit more challenging and less adaptable for beginners.",1317340800,2,1677,4.633898305084746
8005831,3,B00013A0GK,"I purchased this dvd after I had seen the ""Surf Edition.""  Bad move on my part or lucky for you so now I can review fairly.  Don't buy this dvd, buy the ""Surf edition,"" or the new one ""Pursuit of Happy Hips"".  Now onto the why.

As everyone said yes it is one workout cut up to make many.  That's fine with me and that's how the Surf Edition is too.
I really like this instructor though the deal with this one is there is nothing new to me on here.  There are a few cool things and one part he goes into some more advanced postures, but without any explanation.  He's like ""put your leg here,"" and that's about all he says.  So I think he has gotten better with instruction in his newer dvds.  In this one he seems to have more of an ego or maybe just that ""Bryan Kest"" way about him, like sort of showing off a little.  I don't prefer an instructor to do a bunch of advanced stuff and then not teach me how to do it.  Maybe show it and then explain the preparatory postures or something?  He's a good instructor, but his other stuff is much better ;)

P.S. I have done his ""Power Yoga"" dvd and in a way it's better than this one as well; but I'd save my money and get his newer ones instead.

*I have not seen the ""Pursuit of Happy Hips,"" but I am going to buy it, and I have not seen ""Pure and Simple,"" but I am not going to buy it.",1261440000,11,1334,3.9107806691449816
8005832,5,B00013A0GK,The insruction is clear.  The various levels make it more engaging.  I can be a beginner in one pose and take another deeper if it is too easy.  There are plenty of work outs to choose from as well so you can fit to your time constraints.  Its my favorite Yoga DVD.  I almost feel like I'm in a real class.,1246406400,,306,3.9508196721311477
8005833,5,B00013A0GK,"I have been so impressed with this DVD.  Eoin's voice, explanaions, and methods are so calming and clear - it is a joy to spend ""time"" with him everyday.",1240099200,,153,4.275862068965517
8005834,5,B00013A0GK,"This review is really only for the Magically Hips premix - which I absolutely love and frequently use.  It has completely loosened up my hip area, and after years of running, weights and plyometrics I needed exactly what it delivered.  I use it after my short runs and it feels sooooooo nice!  I have done the other practices, and enjoy them as well, but Magically Hips alone is worth the price of the discs for me.

Many others have already commented on Eoin, and I have to say that I find him helpful, encouraging and his joy of yoga comes through and makes me smile during the poses... all in all this practice is wonderful and I will certainly be buying the Surf edition in the near future. :)",1229558400,2,697,4.37984496124031
