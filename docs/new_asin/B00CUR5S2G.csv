This character debuted the same month as Captain America in 1941, so its anyone's guess who may or may not have copied whom. Considering Captain Battle wore an eye patch long before Captain America's boss in SHIELD, Nick Fury, was even created should tell you though. The story, summed up, has Nazi eugenics combined with black magic (the primary antagonist is named the Necromancer) gearing up to launch the Fourth Reich in Sam Battle's hometown, and when the Gulf War veteran returns home he sets to work on them, taking up the name and mantle of his dad, the original Captain Battle.

Spoiler alert: Captain Battle kills Heinrich Himler ;)",1516147200,,698,4.816666666666666

8586642,2,B00CUR5S2G,"This movie took a Golden Age character Captain Battle (Jonathan Battle) and made a knock-off Captain America out of it.  Granted they made Cuyle Carvin stars as the great grandson of Jonathan Battle.

As a knock-off movie it is ok to watch so long as you did not spend over $5 for the movie.
