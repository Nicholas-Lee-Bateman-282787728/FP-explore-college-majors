4007260,4,B002WNU0QW,"Keri Russell, Susan Sarandon and Richard Dreyfuss make up the major supporting cast of LEAVES OF GRASS, a one-off comedy-tragedy in which Edward Norton plays the twins Bill and Brady Kincaid. This is almost entirely Norton's film. He plays off himself with an incredible versimilitude that readily deserves an Academy Award nomination.

Bill and Brady are both brilliant. Bill is an academic, a well-known philosopher at a famous northeastern University. Brady is a career criminal, whose claim to fame is the invention of a new growing technique for marijuana which puts his product in very high demand (pun unintended).

Bill is very far estranged from his family. Nonetheless, when Bill gets a call that Brady has been murdered, he travels to his hometown, a small rural locale near Tulsa, Oklahoma, for the funeral, only to discover that Brady is very much alive.

Brady has hatched a byzantine scheme to quit the drug business, and intends to have Bill impersonate him at home while he secretly meets with his conspirators and competitors. Although Bill at first refuses, Brady is convincing.

Unfortunately, Brady's meetings go horribly awry. Bill discovers, much to his own personal pain and discomfort, that his brother has many enemies, some of whom manhandle Bill, and others of whom accuse Bill of various crimes, all thinking that he is Brady.

Brady's plans ultimately result in an apparent hate crime, near murders, and several gory deaths, including his own.

LEAVES OF GRASS is a multilayered and multifaceted film with many dimensions. Even the title is dualistic, reflecting Bill's passion for Walt Whitman and Brady's passion for cannabis. The two brothers reflect each other's strengths and weaknesses. Bill loves books and reflective thought and leads a quiet, ordered life. Brady disdains books, loves to indulge in his product, is spontaneous, and lives loudly and impulsively. Bill has fled his roots and denies his family, erspecially Brady. Brady embraces his roots and is loyal to those he loves, including Bill.

LEAVES OF GRASS veers sometimes shockingly between comic light and tragic darkness, often in the same scene. A building is decorated with (reversed) swastikas ""leading authorities to conclude that the perpetrators were unfamiliar with the Nazi symbol, or, in a less-likely scenario, that the crime was committed by Hindus."" A philosophical discussion about ""fixing the world"" is punctuated (literally) by one of the speakers being shot with a crossbow. This viewer found himself laughing uproariously through a scene only to be stunned into silence and sadness by an unexpected twist.

An entertaining yet deeply thoughtful film, LEAVES OF GRASS may not appeal to everyone, but, once having seen it, it stays with you.",1287273600,,2759,5.240362811791384
4007261,3,B002WNU0QW,"The movie starts out great. It is smart, sharp, and witty. I would highly recommend doing a quick reading on Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" on Wiki if you are unfamiliar with Whitman's work, what he was trying to accomplish, the criticism of it, as well as the fact he spent his whole life re-writing and expanding it. The movie had the feel of a five star indie in the beginning. Edward Norton, who I have yet to respect as an actor, plays two roles: Bill Kincaid and his twin brother Brad. Bill and Brad are both super intelligent. Brad, the smarter of the two when young, grows pot and enjoys life on the edge. Bill teaches classical philosophy at Brown University. Brad gets his girlfriend pregnant and in order to get Bill to come back to Oklahoma for the wedding, has his friend contact Bill and tell him that he is dead.

Brad has other plans for Bill and plans to use him as an alibi. At this point the movie goes from great to WTF? The flick digresses into what appears to be a writer's inability to figure out how to end a story. Brad, as the smarter brother should of had a better scheme, one where everyone gets what they want, rather than do things by the seat of his pants. I was very disappointed in the writers for leading us down a path that would have made a great classic movie and then not being able to close the deal.",1287187200,3,1336,4.280632411067193
4007262,4,B002WNU0QW,I picked this up to watch not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.  Norton does a really great job playing twins.  The plot is not all that complicated but it's a fun movie that keeps you interested.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Well worth watching,1287100800,,257,4.644444444444445
4007263,5,B002WNU0QW,"LEAVES OF GRASS is a writing and directing triumph for Tim Blake Nelson!  One of the reasons for such applause is the on-screen impression Nelson brings to his roles - that of a funny but not too bright backwoods hick - and that impression is completely squelched (though not in the character he plays in the film -another dummy) by his intelligent and challenging writing and astute direction.  LEAVES OF GRASS as a title begins the dichotomy of message and content of this film: yes, it references Walt Whitman's great book many times and in many ways, but it also refers to the contemporary interpretation of the word 'grass' as being marijuana.  It is that kind of double entendre that propels this film of the conflict and life progress of identical twin brothers from Oklahoma - both played with consummate skill by Edward Norton.

Bill Kincaid (Edward Norton) is a brilliant contemporary and classical philosophy professor at Brown University who speaks in academic terms, having isolated his feelings from the world by obsessing on the meanings of the teachings of Plato, Sophocles, etc: passion is destructive and to be avoided.  He left his Oklahoma family 12 years ago, unable to relate to the shenanigans of his twin brother ex-con Brady (Edward Norton) and his drug-addled mother Daisy (Susan Sarandon).  Back home Brady and Daisy long to see Bill (Daisy has placed herself in a retirement center to avoid bad habits and Brady has developed a sophisticated marijuana production system) and they agree that the only way Bill will come home is if one of them dies.  Brady is in trouble with the drug dealer Pug Rothbaum (Richard Dreyfus) in Tulsa and Brady knows that the only way he and his looney partner Bolger (Tim Blake Nelson) can resolve matters is to get Brady's double back home as an alibi.  Bill recieves a message that Brady has been murdered and reluctantly decides to go home for the funeral.  But arriving home Bill discovers the truth of the ploy and is convinced that if he simply stays in Little Dixie, OK for a weekend he will be able to return to his work.  Confrontations occur, both negative and positive: Bill meets school teacher/poet Janet (Keri Russell) and feels an attraction that has been dormant, Brady introduces Bill to the pleasures of his premium marijuana, Bill meets with Daisy in a moving encounter, Brady and Bolger travel to Tulsa and become involved in murder, and when Brady and Bolger return there is a final scene where the broken worlds of the twins is in a way repaired.

That is only a brief outline of the complex plot that Nelson has written and far too many of the subplots have not been mentioned.  But LEAVES OF GRASS, like reading Whitman's book, must be savored.  The acting is terrific, the atmosphere of Oklahoma is well-captured, and the strange musical score by Jeff Danna matches the story perfectly.  Edward Norton is in top form as both of the twins and the rest of the cast - many very well known names are in minor roles - is uniformly fine.  It is a comedy but as in the classical sense, a true comedy must contain drama, and there is drama 'aplenty' .  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 2010",1286928000,11,3173,4.729582577132486
4007264,4,B002WNU0QW,"The basic plot idea is kind of interesting, and it's easy to watch.  Norton's flexibility as an actor again impresses me - fun to watch him play a hill-billy on one side and a New York academic on the other.  Almost beleivable on both sides.  The story may have been a bit cut and dry, but was still solid overall.  Worth catching for an entertaining 1 hour and 45 minutes.",1286582400,,373,4.285714285714286
4007265,3,B002WNU0QW,"Bill Kincade, a talented, inspiring professor in Providence, Rhode Island learns his pot-dealing twin brother Brady has been murdered. He flies back home to his ""Little Dixie"" roots to not only discover his brother is still alive, but in serious trouble.

""Leaves of Grass"" is a fine effort from writer/director Tim Blake Nelson, who proves he's a talented director in having Ed Norton deliver two great performances as Bill and Brady Kincade. He is simply a joy to watch in both roles and is certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination (or two?).

The supporting performances are mostly good, starting with Tim Blake Nelson as Bolger, Brady's co-hort who drives a magnificent powder-blue El Camino complete with gun rack. Keri Russell shows off her poetry & ""noodling"" skills as Bill's would-be love interest. But poor Richard Dryfuss is given little to do as a extremely Jewish gangster who is ""putting the screws"" to Brady's hydroponic-pot business. His attempt at an ""Okie"" accent is unintentially funny.

It is Nelson's writing however that doesn't quite live up to the acting. While the sub-plots are fairly easy to follow, there are too many of them which jumbles up what otherwise might be a minor classic. In particular, Bill's problem with a hyper female student who's way too enamored with him is unnecessary and how one minor character figures out who actually committed a murder AND his subsequent actions afterwards are so unbelievable that it defies the laugh test.

You can feel the Cohn Brothers influence on Nelson in his storytelling and in particular some of the visuals which include an inspired shot of the twins in a room full of ""black-light"" posters. But some will take note of the stark, unexpected contrast in the comedy and violence which swings wildly back and forth towards the end of the film.

I was born, raised, and still live in Tulsa where parts of this film takes place (although I believe at least some of those scenes were done elsewhere). And while there are some gentle jabs at our state (one character refers to Oklahoma as a ""place without attractions"") it's mostly a loving tribute to the folks who carry on thier lives here in pretty much whatever way they can.

""Leaves of Grass"" is a good effort from Nelson. It does suffer from what ""might have been"" had he pruned the script a bit more and allowed what really works to shine through.",1285459200,,2378,4.830466830466831
4007266,5,B002WNU0QW,"Leaves of Grass is a perplexing nutty film by writer/director/actor Tim Blake Nelson. Edward Norton plays twin brothers, Bill and Brady Kincaid. The two brothers are so different but at the same time strikingly similar. Bill is an intelligent professor at the Brown University that has abandoned his ways of his small hick Oklahoma town while his brother is far from the straight laced person his brother is by managing a small-scale pot farm.

To someone who doesn't understand the two brothers, one might perceive this since Brady is a simple-timing guy who spends his off time smoking bongs that he's not as successful or accomplished as his brother. Brady sees things kind of differently from most people and doesn't judge his success on how others perceive him though. The film ultimately becomes an interesting character study between the two brothers who are on opposite ends of class system but despite their outward appearances are quite similar and both quite intelligent. Brady himself actually has a higher IQ than Bill but despite this decides to pursue a career in drug manufacturing. Does this mean  that Brady is less intelligent though? To most it would seem so, but Brady actually uses his intelligence to form a complex system to manufacture the best possible product.

The plot is interesting as well as it serves as a way for these two brothers to interact with each other and maneuver around the situations that surround them.

Tim Blake Nelson said that he wrote the twin roles for Norton especially in mind and it shows, it's hard it imagine anyone else doing it. Keri Russell serves her purpose that she does in most films she's in being that sweet girl that people fall in love with. There's nothing wrong with that though, Keri Russell is a girl that guys would want to bring home to their mom because she's that cute of a girl.

The reason the film is so good resides in the genius of the screenplay though. The script is simply a masterpiece to put it into simple words. A lot of this is most likely due to Tim Blake Nelson reflecting on things in his own life.

This is surely one of 2010's best films and features a stunning performance by Edward Norton. Norton plays both roles so great, both brothers have a very original feel to them. This is probably the best acting performance he has done besides 25th Hour. Unfortunately, the prospects for this film to receive a wide release are quite small and it's most likely that the film won't receive any recognition from the Academy. Well, when this hits Netflix or your local Redbox, make sure to check it out. It's a masterpiece. This is a day one purchase for me.",1284595200,2,2645,4.70194384449244
4007267,3,B002WNU0QW,"I realize some people love this movie so I am going to say that it just might not be the movie for a 62 year old female.  If you are a guy who smokes grass, you might consider this in your top ten, by contrast.  So I am not seeking to offer my opinion as usable except for those who are like me and say ""huh?"" when reading over the plot summary.

The good thing about the movie is that Norton does an exceptional job playing two identical twin brothers.  One is a University professor and the other grows grass back home in a prairie state.  The grass growing twin is unrecognizable as Norton in every respect.  What will bring these brothers back together as they have been apart for a long time?  That is the basic plot, bringing them back together, as well as with their mother (Susan Sarandon).

Piled on top of this basic plot is a pregnant wife, romance in the air, problems with the pot market and especially the Jewish angle to the pot market, which lets them pour Richard Dreyfuss into the mix. The whole thing was just too much for me.  On the whole, however, if you like the sound of this plot and the people in it, they certainly do a good enough job at the acting, writing and directing.

4007268,4,B002WNU0QW,"A double performance by Edward Norton as two entirely opposite brothers is, surprisingly enough, not the only reason to see this film. Yes, Norton's a master of his craft and his stoner hick brother and oxford-cloth uptight prof brother are both equally masterful creations. He dominates every scene, on par with Nicholas Cage's similar turn in Adaptation or more recently Sam Rockwell's in the slow-burn space opera Moon. But even without a competent lead like Norton at the helm, the film succeeds, chiefly do the the adept writing/direction of Tim Black Nelson, who incidentally has a side-kick part as a dim-witted trailer trash fella with a heart of pure gold.
The script is great. Beginning with a philosophy lecture that doesn't feel at all forced and eventually delving into some pretty shocking violence (and lots of pot smoking...with pot that LOOKS LIKE REAL POT! Seriously, pretty convincing for once) the film is a down-home roller coaster ride that even manages to work in Whitman's titular namesake to pretty good effect. Don't except straight up comedy, as the film is pretty gory at times. The tone, in fact, takes a sort of 180 degree shift about 2/3 of the way in, becoming more dramatic ala a warmer, brighter Fargo or a more subdued, less western-oriented Red Rock West. The effect of this shift is a little disorienting, but ultimately it works, seeming to freshen the proceedings. There is palpable suspense. We feel for Norton's characters, both of them. His accent is pretty good and his eyes (especially as the rural brother) are strange and intoxicating. I can't stress enough how unique and interesting this film is. It works as a crime drama, stoner comedy, philosophical treatise on life/the choices we make that make us. It is equal parts funny, screwball, bloody and in the end pretty life-affirming. There are a couple scenes that feel sort of contrived (one subplot involving a wayward Jewish orthodontist seems a little too easy, but is interesting nevertheless) but overall this is a high-brow bit of sweaty-palmed but laugh inducing entertainment and not be missed if you have a fleeting interest in pot flicks and/or low-life crime character studies.",1272585600,20,2188,5.03030303030303
4007269,4,B002WNU0QW,"Leaves of Grass isn't a movie that you can easily categorize.  While it doesn't offer up laughs every few minutes, it's still a clever comedy in the vein of a Coen Brothers film.  But you also can't quite call it a black comedy completely in the spirit of Burn After Reading or Fargo.  It's equal parts crime drama, humor, romance and philosophy.

The film revolves around the intertwining lives of two identical twins, played by the incredibly talented Edward Norton.  Ivy League philosophy professor Bill Kincaid is lured back to his Oklahoma hometown as part of a scheme cooked up by Mary Jane growing brother Brady.  The first half hour of the film moves slowly but quickly gains momentum when the two siblings eventually cross paths.

The best part of this movie is easily watching Norton put on brilliant performances as both brothers.  The supporting cast is top-notch as well, especially director Tim Blake Nelson in the role of Bolger, Brady's partner in crime.  Nelson slips into the role effortlessly, which is no surprise considering he himself is a real-life Okie (a Jewish one at that, which influences a subplot of the movie).  My only gripe with casting was Richard Dreyfuss as Jewish gangster Pug Rothbaum, with Dreyfuss giving one of the most bizarre attempts at a Southern accent in film.

I enjoyed the cinematography, Jeff Danna's work on the score, and the infusion of philosophy into the film.  As a Southerner, I appreciated the fact that Brady's accent was no reflection on his intelligence.  While not as well-read as his sibling, he still gets the occasional profound message across.  The only real complaint I have about the film are the jarring scenes of violence.  Considering it's not entirely a dark comedy, scenes that involved murders seemed extremely out of place in this movie.

Overall, watching Edward Norton effectively tackle two completely different roles was a real treat.  If you enjoy a good drama or comedy that makes you think, definitely check this one out.",1267660800,40,2004,4.934328358208956

4007368,5,B002WNU0QW,"Bill and Brady are identical twins from the Little Dixie region of Oklahoma.  Bill left his redneck roots and family behind to become a famous professor of classical philosophy. Brady remained behind and became the consummate redneck, complete with tattoos and a state of the art marijuana grow-facility. Brady is also having problems with his lending source/major customer and concocts a ridiculous redneck plot to end all of his troubles.

Edward Norton does a good job as both the studious Bill and the redneck Brady.  There are also surprising supporting stars, such as Richard Dreyfuss as a member of Tulsa's tiny Jewish population, who is also the drug kingpin for Oklahoma.  Listening to Dreyfuss speaking with a Southern accent while explaining how no one suspects him because he's Jewish was startlingly funny.  The movie works by taking its absurd premises and spinning them out to their logical ends.  Susan Sarandon likewise stars as Brady and Bill's eccentric mother.

The premise of the movie is oddball. It is not knee-slapping funny, but it hums along, generating an eccentric mirth and few chortles.

With all the unfunny ""comedies"" that are generated these days, this one has depth and nuance, but don't expect a joke a minute.",1439596800,3,1245,5.068627450980392

4007419,3,B002WNU0QW,"The first half of this movie is pure gold. Speaking as an academic with friends who actually are lit profs. and analytic philosophers, I found the humor revolving around Billy Kincaid's profession to be hilarious and on-point. And of course, Edward Norton is his usual brilliant self, deftly playing Billy and his twin brother Brady off of each other and revealing their hidden similarities. The movie does a great job turning the stereotype of the dull-witted southerner upside down, as marijuana mogul Brady turns out to be just as sharp of an intellect, even if he's applied it a bit... differently. Meanwhile, Keri Russell plays a smart, catfish noodling English teacher who has delightful romantic chemistry with Norton. Unfortunately, director Tim Blake Nelson didn't seem content to let the story run its course as a quirky comedy with some touching/romantic undertones. Instead, it turns grim and ultra-violent around the midway point. It wouldn't be quite as bad if the violence made some sense, but certain scenes almost seemed deliberately bizarre and pointless, almost played for laughs. I couldn't disagree more with this choice and thought it completely derailed the movie. On top of that, the only Christian character to make an appearance is a complete idiot. Ed Norton gets a couple stars all by himself just for being awesome, and the first half is truly brilliant, but I don't recommend this movie as a whole.

They wanted this to be a comedy, but the violence was too over the top and gritty.  Norton turns in a solid performance playing two genius brothers.  One a college professor and the other a pot dealer.  Both had been heavy pot users in their youth.  The professor is played too nave and pure, the pot dealer is really a murderous killer who is suppose to be likeable and also feared.

Secondly , it was also a modern day Greek tragedy that brought into play all the humanistic elements of love , hate , passion , irony , drama , greed , ignorance , murder and deception . What made it unique was the fact that Edward Norton played both roles , one of the Brown University , Professor and also of his identical twin brother , the Oklahoma , pot grower . The movie also had an all star cast of Edward Norton , Richard Dreyfus , Susan Sarandon , Keri Russell and Tim Blake Nelson that created a true and realistic sense of believability for their respective roles . It also brought into play the philosophy of the early Greeks and the modern day poetic wisdom of Walt Whitman ! The movie also focused on fate and how we as humans attempt to direct our lives in one direction , and how outside factors come into play that are some times unforeseen and then alter the course that we have once set for ourselves . This was truly a great movie and could and should be taught and analyzed in any school's curriculum .

4007448,5,B002WNU0QW,"This is so funny, I laughed until I cried.  It shows a side of Edward Norton I never knew existed.  I have seen the serious side of him in so many of his movies, but never realized he had an entirely opposite side.  He plays both sides so very well.  I constantly keep having to do a double take to see if this is really him or someone else.  Even when he is serious, he is so deadpan serious that he and his actions are absolutely hilarious.  Even his facial expressions are side-splitting.  His acting is superb, whether serious or dorky.  Whoever wrote this did an awesome job.  Mr. Norton did an equally incredible job with his non-stop wonderful acting.  I don't know how in the world he could do many of the scenes with a straight face, without cracking up laughing.

Although the subject matter may be questionable to some, certainly no one can argue the terrific performance by Mr. Norton as well as the humor involved.  No slapstick comedic performance, just good old, funny treatment of the subject matter.  I would recommend this movie to anyone ready for a lengthy laugh; however, I do not think it is for children...teens OK.",1388448000,,1138,4.54679802955665

4007450,5,B002WNU0QW,"This is a great movie, with many great aspects. But what makes this movie great, asides from Edward Norton giving one of his finest performances to date, is the themes and elements of Greek comedy and philosophy. And, as anyone who is even minimally informed about Greek theatre (or classic theatre in general, such as Shakespeare), a comedy is not defined as we define them today. If you have a knack for classic theatre and philosophy, you will easily pick up on this movie, and find it delightful on how well they were put into this movie.",1387152000,,542,4.597938144329897
4007451,3,B002WNU0QW,"Leaves of Grass - or as it might be called the Tim Blake-Nelson show, since he conceived, wrote, directed and even has a supporting role in it, is a noble attempt at genre mixing.  We are introduced to two twin brothers who have long since kept their distance and lived very different lives - one the philosophy professor with Harvard aspirations, the other the grower of the titular weed, both played by Edward Norton on double duties.  Leaves of Grass as literary great by Walt Whitman alludes to the former, proverbial Leaves of Grass allude to the latter.  He makes an excellent go at portraying both characters and keeping them firmly separate in your mind.. not an easy  thing to do, though he does seem somewhat more muted in his performance than the material seems to call for.  The story has the philosophical brother return to his Oklahoma roots when he thinks there has been a death in the family, only for a complicated run of events to transpire, as the hick brother tries to get his weed business past some critical negotiations.  Keri Russell's likeable love interest seems to hit the tone the rest of the movie strives for - down to earth country girl at heart who actually is as much a philosopher and poet and as clever as either of Norton's characters.
One of the things this movie has going for it is it's resistance to pigeon-holing.  Just as you think you have it sussed, it will throw you a curve ball.  It's a sweet romance hidden inside a Coen Brothers riffing philosophical black comedy thriller with a soupcon of Tarantino-esque violence which suddenly appears once you have been lulled into a false sense of security.  While laudable, this does make for a tonally uneven film, likely to make you wish for more of one aspect or another, depending on your leaning.  It's not an action film - but the violence, particularly in the scene with cameo by Richard Dreyfuss, is as brutal as it is sudden, coming hot on the heels of some genuinely quite tender and soul searching moments just before.
All in all then, there's enough originality here to enjoy, and more than a few actors worth watching, including Susan Sarandon in an underwritten role as the brother's mum.  There are moments which make you think you are watching something a little unique.. but the studied quirkiness in some places sits ill at ease with the more generic and predictable elements particularly in the films resolution.  When Nelson tried to roll his own, seems he tied to get too much at once and the wrapper can't quite hold it all.. Still it's got brains, which sets it above the pack.  A qualified thumbs up then..

Bill is extremely disciplined and successful but alos very uptight. Brady who is actually smarter than Bill, is sloppy, lazy and slides from one catastrophe to the next.

4007470,5,B002WNU0QW,"I feel that I know good cinema, and I must say that this is a masterpiece by the very talented Tim Blake Nelson.

Whatever criticisms levied at this film are by those who seemingly don't use their noggins (""But what about his job at Brown? At Harvard? Rushed ending, blah, blah...""). Smart people can think for themselves and fill in the blanks without needing every seeming plot inconsistency smoothed out for them. Anyone who enjoys serious movies with true-to-life dialogue should enjoy this - having studied any philosophy or any reading material that isn't superficial and yet doesn't stray into the pretentious should render one able to appreciate this film. It is noteworthy that Nelson actually went to Brown for Classics/Classical Philosophy and that he is from Oklahoma; the authenticity that these experiences lend the film is quite evident. The soundtrack is killer, too!

I really can't stress how much I love this film, mainly because it delves deeply into every issue that it explores, be it philosophy, marijuana production and distribution, Judaism and Kabbalah (after seeing it, google ""repairing the world"" and ""tikkun olam""), and of course the very blunt lives of southerners and how a mere idle conversation can turn to the topic of death as quickly as any other and without any warning, as death often happens in life without warning, just like some of the surprising and effective scenes in this movie. See it!",1330732800,,1433,5.016806722689076
4007471,3,B002WNU0QW,"Weed and philosophy aren't usually two things that we think of as compatible, but Tim Blake Nelson's witty, literate script and Edward Norton's dual-role virtuoso acting make them seem like peanut butter and jelly.

When we first meet Norton's Bill Kincaid, he's delivering a philosophy lecture to a mesmerized audience of Brown students, and Nelson allows this sequence several minutes to develop and present a heavy conceptual point. He follows this with a controlled-slapstick sequence in which a female student attempts to seduce Bill, only to be interrupted at an awkward-looking juncture by his staid secretary, who delivers the news that kicks the whole plot into motion: Bill's twin brother Brady has died. Bill reluctantly heads home only to discover that his brother is alive and well and has drawn him into a fustercluck of epic proportions.

The seesawing effect of following tension or heavy emotions with smart, masterfully written comedy is something Nelson sticks with throughout his screenplay, and this rhythm serves the plot well until about the final fourth, when unexpected and highly implausible violence erupts and compromises the overall quality somewhat. The characters who initiate the violence, two peaceful, philosophically-inclined, perpetually-baked good ol boys, have up to this point shown no inclination whatsoever to the sort of bloodlust that fuels the crime they commit, and a minor character who had previously served no purpose is clumsily inserted into the aftermath seemingly for the sole purpose of justifying more mayhem.

But there's a lot more good than bad here, especially if you read poetry and philosophy or grow dank 'dro. Ed Norton literally looks and behaves like two completely different people and is riveting in both roles. Nelson inhabits his second-banana role like wearing a second skin and delivers a natural performance. Keri Russell's Janet, a love interest for Bill, actually does and says things a real woman might say and do and has a whole personality, which puts Tim Blake Nelson ahead of 90% of the male scriptwriters writing movies these days. Janet is a plausible person, not just a flimsy wish-fulfillment fantasy insertion character who exists only to reflect on the males in her orbit. Susan Sarandon is her usual drawling, easygoing self as Bill and Brady's pothead mom, a vital and attractive sixtysomething woman who has decided, for her own eccentric reasons, to voluntarily put herself in a nursing home despite having no visible infirmities. Richard Dreyfus turns up to briefly amuse as a local crime boss who happens to be an esteemed civic leader in Tulsa, Oklahoma's Jewish community, which is apparently a real thing (Tim Blake Nelson is himself a Jew from Tulsa).

The strong characterizations, beautiful dialog and literacy of the plot as a whole make this movie worth spending money on. Bummer of a climax though.",1330560000,,2897,5.223655913978495

4007473,5,B002WNU0QW,"There isn't much to say that hasn't been said by others.

My favorite thing about this film is that it was a new story,  not the same boring, meaningless drivel that usually ends up making the most money.  The actors & producers weren't trying to make everyone happy,  they were trying to make a good film & knew it wouldn't appeal to everyone.

The thing which strikes me most about the story,  and yet doesn't get mentioned - is that all of the violence and death in this film comes from the fact that the grass is under prohibition - just like all the violence which resulted from alcohol prohibition and just as regrettable.  If Brady could have worked on his agriculture without the threat of prison,  he wouldn't have had to deal with a shady dealer of dangerous narcotics for financing.  If his plants were legal,  he could have resolved his business dispute in court instead of with violence and nobody would have been killed.

Anyway... good movie,  I'm glad the film industry still takes risks by shooting quirky, not-for-everyone stories that they know won't make as much money as vapid action thrillers.  Every actor in this film earned their keep by presenting believable representations,  and of course Ed Norton rocked the hell out of both roles.  Not bad camera work either...  I read a couple reviews that the ""twins"" don't exactly look each other in the eye when they're talking to each other... wha?

4007474,5,B002WNU0QW,"This is a great drama.  Portraying human interactions in a plausible fashion, sort of like an independent movie.  Some short, possibly deep, statements about God and existence made by characters within the movie.  The conversations which fall into the conceivably deep existentialism catergory are mainly one sided.  Edward Norton as the Stoner, at one point makes an overly complicated statement, which could have much easier been said - God represents the unattainable.  That's about how deep they get.  The attempts at comedy fall flat on their face.  Situational comedy doesn't work so well when the situation is all to predictable and plausible as something which commonly happens in real life.  I would say that the parts of this movie some are calling funny serve mainly to lighten things up. So that the movie doesn't seem too serious.  Richard Dreyfus, in a small role, is the only funny person in the movie.  He made me actually laugh out loud one time, throughout the movie.

Ed Norton delivers one of his best performances in this little-seen film about twin brothers: one an Ivy League classics professor and the other an Oklahoma redneck dope dealer.  When the two worlds collide, the philosophical tenets of higher civilization are tested in the real world of criminal aspirations.  Not many films mix Aristotle, catfish noodling, Oklahoma synagogues and crossbow killings.  It all begins when the insulated professor gets word his twin has been murdered.  But when he arrives in Oklahoma, he realizes he's been hoodwinked into a dangerous scheme that he can't easily avoid.

If you are expecting a stoner comedy such as half baked, this movie is not for you. It is labeled as a comedy, and although this movie was pretty funny, it is a dark humor and the movie explores a lot of serious issues. I really enjoyed all of the philosophical dialouge, (Ed Norton plays a professor in classical philosophy).The story is also very entertaining and includes a few unexpected plot twists.

Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.

4007485,2,B002WNU0QW,"Stacking the plates and glasses of broad comedy, culture clash, intellectual and existential concerns, and extreme violence onto a single tray is a delicate balance. Tim Blake Nelson's shaggy dog caper spills them all on the dining room floor. He's clearly shooting for the humor, dread and sudden jolts of the Coen Brothers (right down to the extremely Carter Burwell-esque score), but like a fair number of the characters in this film, his aim is askew. The tone is all over the place and in the end, none of it really adds up to anything substantial. Edward Norton plays twin brothers who are polar opposites -- a feat that once again proves dual roles are rarely a good idea.",1304812800,3,679,4.714285714285714

Ed Norton in a double role: Professor of classical literature in Providence, identical twin of a relatively decent dope grower and dealer in Oklahoma. You can't lead a clean life in a dirty business, as Adorno said. Meaning, he, the dealer brother, gets into trouble over the economics of the industry. The big man of the industry on state level (Dreyfuss) demands loan repayment. Things get very violent, by and by.
The professor is tricked into paying a visit home. He sees his estranged mom (Sarandon). He meets a charming local girl (English teacher and poetess) who catches catfish by hand, and recites Whitman and herself to him. Providence loses attraction. That is further enforced by a pending investigation into improper behavior with a student. Big time career damage looms.
The rabbi in Dreyfuss' Tulsa community suggests to the professor, after quite some bodily damage has already been done, to try and repair the world. Oh no. Nothing good can come of that.

The title of the film suggests a dopey take on Whitman. The DVD box suggests a comedy around rednecks. We dive into religious themes with the Jewish and Christian gangsters(the Coens not being very far away in my thoughts). We have a generation conflict derived from hippy morals and filial rebellion.
The problem of the film is that it tries to be too many things at once. We end up neither properly amused nor thrilled, nor do we feel an urge to shed tears over family stuff.
I am not bad at using the off button when I dislike a film. This one is not in that category. It is just not fully thought through.",1304035200,4,1819,4.699059561128527

but I like that about it! (-:
This is a very good movie, and Ed Norton very convincingly plays dual roles in this.
The supporting cast, which includes the dazzling Susan Sarandon, who plays a somewhat subdued role as
the twins' ex-wild child mother, all give brilliant performances in their individual roles.

4007488,3,B002WNU0QW,"Didn't the ivy-league classical philosophy professor misuse the word ""precipitous""? Never mind... I enjoyed Edward Norton in both these roles, so the crooked stitching here and there is not a bad price to pay. Though far short of being another ""Fargo,"" this is a watchable, memorable dark comedy, with great characters and perfect casting in my opinion. I'm glad they strove for the right Okie accent, cowboy Southern like my Grandma and Grandpa and uncles and cousins. Most movies flop so badly in this area (of Southern accents) that I can't let loose and accept the story, or even sit through the movie sometimes. The grammar was WAY, way off, but nobody's ever going to get both the syntax AND the drawl near-right, it is asking too much of Hollywood.

But it curdles my milk to be watching happily along, and here comes the ""I hate you, Mommy, you ignored me, and your whole generation ruined the world for your kids!"" bit from the 28-48 year old grownup child. Parent obsession is so eerie to me, in real life and fiction. Flipping out on your mother and throwing a snit that makes you feel better by making her feel bad (that's her job!) is unmanly by definition (and even uglier, I think, when a daughter does it). This son took special university courses to try and figure out his mommy. Please! He didn't! Yes, he claims that indeed he did.

What he really needed was the one thing he's never going to get: a personal note from Uncle Sam ordering him to report for active duty in the Army or Marines, destination Vietnam. Think how much that could have taught this fragile boy-child about the generation he so deeply puzzles over.

There were some mean jabs at Oklahoma in this movie that seemed gratuitous, even jammed into the script much the way I'm jamming this paragraph into my review. ""Nobody goes to Oklahoma for the tourism or culture,"" said the orthodontist on the flight from New York, ""I mean no one!"" Or words in that vein. It went on like that for a protracted length of time that felt downright strained. Oklahoma tourism is in fact resplendent and thriving. Mountains, waterfalls, caves, crystal lakes, lonesome prairies with prairie dogs popping in and out of their holes (cute!), cliffs, blazing sunsets and starlit nights -- boating, swimming, fishing -- and nowhere in the world is prettier than Oklahoma. To jab the region and its people in the particular way this movie did in that one scene...many might consider that cheap and tacky. Bill Maher would probably wallow in it like a hog in cool mud on an August afternoon. But what about everyone else?

I just can't leave without a lecture or two, sorry! The brother and son in LEAVES OF GRASS had more than enough to contend with and he did it well. Good movie.",1300492800,2,2744,4.651546391752578

4007492,3,B002WNU0QW,"Slapdash might be the best word for this one; it tries to be a whole bunch of things and does almost none of them well. There are a few decent performances, but the script is so self-conscious and preachy at times that it lets the air out of most of the potentially good moments. Norton is good as the prof but laughable as the ""bad twin"", a weak caricature at best. I grew up around many guys like that and Norton captures almost none of their real edge or style. It's just a cartoon, which might be fine if so much of this movie wasn't trying to be intellectual.

As a writer/director/actor, Nelson is a pretty good actor. The script is overwrought and ridiculously unrealistic when trying to be real and mostly lame when trying to be funny. None of this rings true, feeling more like a high school play written by a tortured senior wondering what the world is really all about and having read just enough Greek philosophy to make ponderous declarations. Making all of this much worse are the occasional moments of real violence, which jar and seem completely out of place. The ending is just plain ridiculous, suddenly adding overdone pathos where it doesn't belong and mindless violence for no apparent reason other than Nelson couldn't write a more satisfying conclusion. Ditto his direction, which at times feels pure film-student---""look at this clever shot I set up!"". But like the script, it tries too hard and ends up as self-parody.

Sarandon wisely plays it quiet and comes off as well as anyone. Dreyfuss is ridiculous in the seemingly pointless subplot, his accent almost as fake as Norton's. (And his outrageously overzealous botox technician has made him look almost alien now. Is this the future of aging Hollyweird stars? Ouch.) Nelson is fine as the stoner buddy, offering much more real feeling than Norton does as his counterpart, though I could buy Norton as the prof. Russell is very good and her scenes seem the most genuine here, but almost feel like they're from another movie.

The blu-ray is rather useless as the picture is nothing special, and the one extra, a 10-minute making-of, offers little worth watching.

All in all, from the cast and the synopsis, I expected a lot more than what was delivered. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone other than serious Ed Norton fans who have to see everything he does, and even then I'd say watch Primal Fear and X and Fight Club for the fourth time before you bother with this vague non-tribute to Walt Whitman, one of our greatest poets and a purveyor of art on a level far far beyond what Nelson offers here.",1293408000,,2582,4.668131868131868

The plot was not very believable to begin with and then the logical leaps just added to the dissatisfaction. For example, it's just not plausible for the orthodontist to run back home after hearing on the radio that Pug Rothbaum had been killed - and then do an internet search on Bill Kincaid whom he had met very briefly on the plane - and put two and two together that somehow the person he saw at the Synagogue was the identical twin brother of Bill - and that this brother had killed Pug and was using Bill as an alibi... Sound confusing? Well, it was. Ed Norton delivers on his acting but even that felt over-the-top and just not believable.

4007501,5,B002WNU0QW,"Somehow, I ended up buying this movie without knowing anything about it.

I like Edward Norton and his characterization of two halves of the same personality diverging and reconverging seems in line with other split personality roles he's portrayed in the past (Fight Club notably).

I left the DVD impressed, in short. The movie features complex humanistic ideals that are rarely seen in most movies today. I'll save some spoilers. The movie isn't predictable, most of supporting characters are flimsy, but serviceable. Susan Sarandon and Edward Norton's characterizations are brilliant. The movie tosses the difference between Ivy League and Bumpkin in the trashcan, Brady and Bill are as different as they can be, but yet they are still identical twins. ""How does a person become who they are?"" The movie asks lithely.

""Leaves of Grass"" doesn't stand on modern stereotypes, it doesn't make cartoonish generalizations about people, it kisses everybody gently on the forehead and vindicates the lives they have chosen. The points and lessons the movie quietly sticks in (when you aren't looking) behind the main story are the fascinating points of the movie. This movie doesn't pretend to be dumb, but it leaves the brainy points quietly for observation later. At several points in the movie, it offers an idea, misdirects your suspicion of foreshadowing or predictability and turns it backwards on you with a bitter irony welded to it. ""Logan's Run"" almost made C.S. Lewis work as a device in a movie, ""Leaves of Grass"" makes Walt Whitman work as a device.

One reviewer said this movie 'Defied Categorization' or something to that effect. Quite accurate. I wouldn't call it a comedy, but it isn't a big downer. I think it could be called a modern drama or a Greek Tragicomedy.

If you like ""Boom. Bang. Big fire."" type movies, you might not really appreciate ""Leaves of Grass"". The movie is a more mature circumspect movie that offers insight and wisdom. Well worth a watch.

Pot smoking is glorified a little and the negative aspect is ignored. Marijuana can ruin a person's life very easily. It's not for kids! I think pot should be legal, but it's something that needs lots of respect and restraint. Arguably, it's a better way to unwind than using alcohol. Let's be honest and state that a person's life can go to hell after doing either. Reefer Madness and the Lost Weekend!

Ultimately though, I don't give this the highest rating because I think the script/storyline could have easily been improved. Sadly, I think this movie had fantastic potential if it had only gone places I imagined that it might have. I would have loved for Brady to turn out to be more brainy than his philosphy professor brother. That could've really made for some interesting scenes and dialog. I imagined the marijuana grower to be something of a guru that other growers looked up to and highly respected in the business. I imagined his philosophic brother learning something profound from him... Instead, he turns out to be just a grower that solves a huge problem with the solution being murder. Just my opinion...

Still, I liked enough that I'd like to see it again.

One more thing that bothered me a bit is that, watching this on Blu-Ray with an HDTV, the scenes where the brothers were both present were not convincing. I could tell they weren't really in the same scene and that it had been edited to make it appear that way.",1287792000,,1104,4.656410256410257

Brotherly love, cannabis, catfish noodling, crossbows, Jews, drugs and death in Tulsa!

Ivy League philosphy professor Bill Kincaid (Ed Norton) is lured back to his Oklahoma hometown, where his twin brother Brady (Ed Norton), a small-time pot grower, has concocted a scheme to take down a Tulsa drug lord (Richard Dreyfuss). Throw in their crazy mother (Susan Saradon), Brady's half wit sidekick (Tim Blake Nelson) and the always lovely (Keri Russell) and you've got one seriously good time.

The movie starts out slow and then keeps building up and building up into a full blown dark comedy.

If your an Ed Norton fan, this movie is obviously a must see, as he plays two characters, twin brothers Bill and Brady Kincaid. The supporting cast is excellent as well, Keri Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Tim Blake Nelson and Josh Pais. Josh Pais is pretty much an unknown name, but his face is definitely familiar from other films. He plays Jewish dentist Ken Feinman and has a small role in the movie at first and a large role near the end, his breakdown scene is absolutely hilarious!
