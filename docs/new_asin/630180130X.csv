369807,4,630180130X,Classic Tom Baker. Loved the pea shoter(using it to breath) gag in the storage bin. Leela looked hot and acted like the savage she was. Robots were great walking dead men. Helium bit still has me laughing.,984096000,,205,4.5675675675675675
369808,5,630180130X,"This is Dr Who as it should be - intelligent, thought-provoking and filled with grown-up drama, believable characters and no shortage of suspence.  The Doctor and Leela arrive on a sandminer in which the crew are assisted by robot servants.  But somebody has been reprogramming the robots to commit murderous acts on the human crew in a clever 'whodunnit' storyline.  So what we have here is a real classic piece of sci-fi.  The cliffhangers are gripping and the robots, with their refined manner, contrasting the usual kinds of villains in Dr Who, are genuinely chilling.  An interesting point is one the crew's psychological problem 'robophobia' known as 'Grimwade's syndrome' (named after Dr Who director Peter Grimwade, who hated directing stories containg robots).  A genuine classic from the golden age of Dr Who.",975628800,,819,5.166666666666667

How did Chris Boucher do it? One classic after the other! ""The Robots of Death"" is probably one of the most claustrophobic murder mysteries in the entire series. Leela's second story only fleshes out her character even more. The futuristic setting is ideal for her development: ""The other mechanical man told us to wait here..."" Tom Baker is also in fine form. And the supporting cast is stellar! Chris Boucher's script is filled with one memorable line after the other. And the robots, well, they might be one of the most unique robots ever on the program. Kudos to D-84. How can one season have so many classics? And thanks to the Doctor Who Restoration Team for a another stellar product. I've never seen Who so clean & crisp, showing a high standard in the art of transferring old programs onto DVD.

369811,5,630180130X,"This Tom Baker story is an extremely stylish, visually stunning and well written example of Doctor Who. Set aboard a sandminer crawling across the desert surface of a nameless planet, ""The Robots of Death"" is a  murder mystery with interesting characters, whose interactions show people  with hidden motives, secrets and fears - they are three dimensional and  believable. The story has both action and creeping suspense, with some  genuinely frightening, psychological and claustrophobic moments. But the  piece de resistance to this story is the design. There's the art deco of  the sandminer and the wonderfully decadent costumes, but best of all, the  robots themselves. They look exquisite and are beautiful and deadly. Their  cold, calm menace is chilling; the ""pulse"" music that accompanies  their slow paces through the corridors of the Sandminer is wonderfully  atmospheric.

369867,5,630180130X,"Robots of Death is one story that's deserving of all its hype. The story of the Doctor aboard a space mining ship with killer robots works brilliantly with a lot of great sci fi and horror elements at work, along with a great mystery story. The tale also has appropriate bits of humor thrown in, along with magnificent performances from Tom Baker and Louise Jameson.

If there was any flaw in the story, it was the immediate change in one character's personality once he was revealed not to be behind the killer robots. But that's a small point. This is a great story that's a must-watch for every Doctor Who Fan.",1409529600,,613,4.5225225225225225

369871,5,630180130X,"One of my all-time favourite Dr Who productions, when I saw it the first time round, as child, I found it pretty scary stuff. The homicide plotline is indebted in great to Agatha Christie; and her murder mystery thrillers. There also references to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. What made this particular teleplay so cerebral was the way in which a very clever script, is enriched with great sets/costumes and good acting that has made this set of four episodes a real classic. You even get new psychological clinical terms such as Robophobia or 'Grimwade's Syndrome'. This was second outing for Tom Baker and his new companion and rumour has it that they were not on the best terms to put mildly. I do not want to give spoilers, so there the briefest of plot overviews.

On a planet far far away, a colossal sandminer factory vehicle called Storm Mine 4, is slowly mining the surface of a vast, desolate desert in search of precious minerals. The sandminer is crewed by nine humans and plethora of different humanoid robots - the black ones are 'Dums' that cannot speak, the pale green are 'Vocs', and a silver is a 'Super Voc' which controls all the 'Dums' and 'Vocs'. The robots conduct a routine scan of the area and locate a large sandstorm (Dune reference), which the humans decide to chase, as the storm will stir up heavier minerals to the surface. A human meteorologist, called Chub goes to gather an instrument package to place into his weather dirigible to study the storm. However, he is found dead,on another part of the vehicle a familiar blue box materializes - so begins another Dr Who adventure.

It is interesting to note that sandminer design and function were heavily influence by Frank Herbert's Dune, . Another point interest aspect, well I found interesting anyway, is that at one point in the narrative the sandminer's engines are about to run out of overheat, threatening the factory vehicle plus crew with imminent destruction. They find the human engineer responsible for controlling the power-plant is dead, strangely enough he is called Borg!

For me this narrative had good twists and turns, and is a real must see on DVD. This particular story has to be somewhere in my top ten Dr Who adventures.",1390867200,,2235,4.7700258397932815

Seeing my favorite Doctor & my favorite companion in a story involving futuristic robots is like a dream come true, and the story did not disappoint in the least.  It had a claustrophobic feel to it, which really added to the tension.  The robot costumes actually look quite good, especially compared to some of the ones the earlier Doctors have faced.

369880,5,630180130X,"Robots of Death is a great episode and instantly familiar to any long-time Who fans once you see the iconic robots featured in the story.  However, the commentary tracks alone are well worth the price.  In this Special Edition there are two commentary tracks, one with producer Phillip Hinchcliffe and writer Chris Boucher, and a second track with Tom Baker, Louise Jameson, Pamela Salem (she played Toos in the ep) and director Michael Briant.  This second track in particular is a real treat, with Tom Baker being his usual flirty and hilarious self, and all four of them reminiscing about the BBC in the 70s and comparing and contrasting those times with the present.  They also talk about the difference in the way shows are made and actors are trained between the UK and America.  Tom Baker talks about how being ""The Doctor"" impacted his life in a really frank manner, and I found the whole discussion fascinating.  I've heard his commentary on a number of Doctor Who DVDs and he never fails to disappoint, but I thought on this one he was particularly engaging.

The DVD has the usual Doctor Who extras with closed captioning and factoid description options.  Feedthecat wrote about all the other nifty DVD options included.",1334102400,2,1231,4.828571428571428
369881,5,630180130X,"The Robots of Death (Special Edition).
Notes for consideration:
1. I am a very nostalgia-driven fan of Tom Baker as Dr. Who.  I am also a fan of scripts and decent dialogue.  I do like the new series, but feel it is (surprisingly) hurt by the lack of serialization.
2. Many of the considerations of this story have weathered well and show more imagination than many recent science fiction puff pieces being produced with staggering budgets; however, someone unaquainted with older productions like this need to be prepared for ""stagey-ness"" and tiny budgets.
3. This is an excellent Dr. Who homage to Isaac Asimov's robot treatments (My words, not theirs).
4. The ""robophobia"" extra is very cute, but the production interviews are awesome.",1332547200,4,739,5.0
369882,4,630180130X,"Well here's another mixed bag of nuts for you to consume, and hopefully you won't have an allergic reaction from ingesting this.  I'm not going to summarize these stories since any fan already knows them, and there is already enough redundant information available for those unfamiliar with this release.

I received this as a box set, Revisitation 3, and so I am posting this general review for all three singular releases since all the information is more or less the same for all three.

To be fair, when it comes to picture and sound restoration, these have been significantly improved, and for many people, this alone makes these worth the purchase.  But when it comes down to the specials, I'm a tough nut to crack.  While yes, there has been some new bonus features added, some of the bonus features from the previous releases were omitted.  So if you're getting this new set, and want to have all the bonus material that has been released, DON'T SELL YOUR OLDER RELEASES.  Many of the recent DVD releases have been far short of impressive for bonus features, so not including everything from prior releases with new material is just sad.  Also, if anyone is a geek about the text commentary like I am, these are usually up-dated in the Revisitation sets, but the originals are also omitted.  Personally, I want it all.  Just because the information on these previously released text commentaries are old, it doesn't make them any less interesting.  After all, both new and old audio commentaries are available on the new releases when applicable, so why leave out an older text commentary?  Can we say ""marketing ploy?""

Something else that bothers me is that while it's fantastic to see these restored with better picture and sound, why doesn't 2|entertain first focus on releasing all the other previously unreleased stories, before re-releasing these stories?  I would think that you should crawl, then walk, then fly.  But these releases are more like crawling, then walking, then going back to crawling, but at a faster pace.

And finally, can we PLEASE get rid of Toby Hadoke?  There has to be someone, ANYONE, who was directly part of these stories that can be utilized for commentaries and special features.  I would give my walnuts to never hear or see him on future releases.

My bottom line is, that while the stories get five stars, the few additional extras, and lack of including some previous extras, make brings it down to 2 to 3 three stars, so that's why I'm giving this overall package a 4 star rating.  Perhaps the Re-re-release will have all this, current and previously released material, with some more new bonus material.

Please let me know if this review is helpful to you, and please tell me your opinions on my review so that I can hopefully improve upon my reviews for future reviews.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider my opinion.",1330387200,12,2890,4.772635814889336
369883,2,630180130X,Why is the BBC spending money and resources re-releasing titles that have already been put out on DVD when great titles have yet to be released? This isn't even that great a story. Always found this one a bit boring. We get this again yet we still don't have Death to the Daleks or Terror of the Zygons on DVD?

369904,5,630180130X,"When this superb four episode story from the last of the Hinchcliffe-Holmes years of Tom Baker's stint as the fourth Doctor was first released on dvd years ago (in  2000 or 2001 ~ it was one of the first on disc in any event), the extras were pretty much limited to (audio) commentary from producer Hinchcliffe and writer Chris Boucher  and a photo gallery.  Guess they just figured that we Who fans would be so estatic about no longer  having to watch our worn VHS tapes any more that we wouldn't mind being gypped on the ""special features"".

After years of waiting, we're finally being given a remastered version of 1977's THE ROBOTS OF DEATH and one that comes with some of the extras that we've come to expect, such as a new commentary track - featuring Baker, Louise Jameson (""Leela""), Pamela Salem (""Toos""), and director Michael Briant - plus the one from the original dvd release, a ""making of"" doc entitled ""The Sandmine Murders"", and another doc concerning ""robophobia"" - that is, if this US/Canada re-release has the same extras as the Special Edition that's part of the REVISITATIONS 3 box set that will be released in the UK also next year (that set also includes new editions of THE THREE DOCTORS and THE TOMB OF THE CYBERMEN).  Might also note that the price of this single disc SPECIAL EDITION of Doctor Who story #90 is comparable to some of the other dvd re-releases.

As for the plot ... well, I don't want to give too much away to Amazon shoppers who've never seen this all time Who classic, so I'll just state that the Doctor and his new ""companion"" Leela (the Doctor just met the knife-wielding, Janis thorn-throwing member of the tribe called ""The Sevateem"" in the previous story, ""The Face of Evil"") arrive on a sandmining vehicle operating on an uninhabited planet and soon find themselves under suspicion for a crewmember's murder.  While the Doctor and Leela are a treat to watch in action and the various crewmembers prove a diverse and interesting cast of characters, it's the robots who steal the show, not only for their soft, dulcet voices and striking design, but also for the chilling manner that they ... well, as I said, don't wanna give too much away.  Enjoy.

Incidentally, while it's nice that BBC Video/2 Entertain is releasing new, special editions of many Who classics with better picture quality and the addition of Making Of docs, I, personally, wd have preferred if they had first turned their attention to releasing stories that have YET to be put out on dvd, such as ""The Daemons"" (Story 59).

In fact I would say it is one of the best stories of his time EVER.  I love the feel of a well designed, well made world setting.  It suggests that events and people are active and alive beyond the edges of the screen.  Yet it is also a mystery set in the middle of no where - dark and alone in a sand storm.
The story starts when the Doctor and Leela find themselves on Storm Mine Number 4.  A traveling factory that mines the sands and storms for rare material - think DUNE.  On it is a greedy, and somewhat bored, crew of humans and a very large crew of helping robots.  The robots are beautiful in their design and in the idea behind them.  This is enough of a hook for me but it gets better when somebody is murdered.  Of course, the Doctor and Leela are blamed.

369913,5,630180130X,"This is one of the better Tom Baker entries. It ran in 1977 (January 29th - February 19th), and is 95 minutes in length (broken down into 4 episodes). It's full-screen and in color. The story was written by Chris Boucher (story No. 090) and this copy is nice and clear with no film scratch lines or other distortions. There are a few special features (photo gallery, commentary, and some really weird unused footage).

The story here is that The Doctor and Leela (she's very hot-looking as usual) land the Tardis on a desolate mining planet where a few humans (men and women) oversee lots of busy robots who do all the work, including running the huge juggernault of a machine that does the mining. In fact, almost all the sequences are filmed ""inside"" the big mining-ship.

Right after the two show up, one of the miners is coincidentally murdered and The Doctor and Leela get blamed because the robots are programmed never to harm humans. There seems to be no motive for one human miner to have killed another. But it soon becomes apparent that the robots' programming may have been altered by some subversive.... (well, THAT would be a SPOILER!)

In any event, it ends up being pretty much the robots versus the humans before it's all over... with a couple of exceptions. And, I should reiterate, the robots look pretty spiffy, with metallic humanoid faces.

Tom Baker is at his best in this one and it doesn't drag anywhere. The story is interesting and the sets are pretty darn good. Overall, this is a top Doctor Who entry and I would recommend it to all sci-fi fans.",1200268800,3,1573,4.607142857142857
369941,5,630180130X,"Well, maniacs or no, the good folks involved in the production of this masterpiece of a ""Doctor Who"" storyline surely deserve to gloat a little. The story's concept is good solid science fiction at its very best, the characterization is psychologically complex and interesting and the acting top-notch and convincing. The plotline is pretty much flawless, starting on the right foot and never losing steam. And the very palpable level of suspense is probably a new benchmark in the show's long history--my wife and I were planning on watching the first two episodes of this DVD one day and the last two the next, but after the end of episode two my wife adamantly insisted on seeing it through to the end, and I wasn't hard to convince.

The title of course gives away something of the basic premise. Ever wonder what C-3PO would be like on a bad day? The contrast between the mildly polite and proper behavior of the robots and their brutal acts of murder makes for a chilling contrast (death with etiquette?). But of course there's more to these events than meets the eye, and the viewer is kept guessing until the end, misled again and again with a host of false leads and dead ends (if you'll pardon the expression). This is very much a whodunit in the style of Agatha Christie, a format invented and developed in Britain and, as this show demonstrates, still very much their forte even when rearticulated into a science fiction idiom and spiced up with a healthy bit of influence from Isaac Asimov (seasoned with a little dash of Frank Herbert). To go into any more detail than that would be to stack up spoiler upon spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.

I will only go on to say that there are a host of other little things I liked about this storyline. The dialogue is expertly scripted, with little comments here and there by the different characters all adding up to give the viewer a very concrete impression of some future society in all its complexity. The visually appealing mix of styles in costume and interior decor nicely suggests such a society as well, a sort of generic ""earthling"" culture spread out among the stars--and the dominant ""art deco"" look gives just the right suggestion of fin-de-siecle decadence, of ""the end of a civilization"" as the Doctor puts it. This goes for the vaguely neo-classical design of the robots as well. As for the conclusion, I'm sworn on the holiest of oaths not to give it away, but I can say that it's a classic example of the Doctor using good old basic scientific knowledge and know-how to save the day--simple but quite effective, not to mention laced with an incredibly satisfying dose of irony and instant karma.

On a different note, this is also the first DVD so far to feature the Doctor's traveling companion, Leela. She remains one of my favorites. It's always wonderful how she bring a neolithic sensibility to a futuristic setting, giving everything a fresh perspective, and for once its nice to have an aggressively capable woman character, one who's much more likely to have a go at the monster or villain with her trusty knife than stand there screaming for the Doctor like some ninny. I don't think we've really quite seen that since Barbara made a speed bump out of a Dalek back in 1964. Plus, okay, I had a huge crush on this character when I was a teenager, and it's a nice bit of nostalgia to see her again--and wow, the crush was well-founded, I must say. Ahem, anyway, as I was saying.

This is apparently one of the first ""Doctor Who"" DVD releases, and as such it has minimal extras. Which is fine. The extras on many of the ""Doctor Who"" DVDs are better than average, but just how many documentaries about the ""Hinchcliffe Years"" can we have without getting a tad redundant, really?

Anyway this was and is still by far one of my favorite episodes. Yea the Daleks are awesome and the ultimate villians as well as the cybermen. These freaky robots are not as great as the cybermen but they are creepy.

They look like a cross between the original Ommpaloompas in the 1970's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and androids painted silver color to look like robots. The low budget costumes look like spray painted foam and tin foil.

The Doctor and Leela find themselves inside of a giant mining machine that roves the surface of a wasteland planet.  It's a huge thing, with several people and many robots working and living inside for apparently many months at a time.  Some of these people start turning up dead, and the mystery begins.

The robots still look cool.  The people's costumes are fairly ridiculous, but that seems to have been the intention.  The ostentatiousness of the folks' dress indicates how decadent their society has become.

369947,4,630180130X,"It is little surprise that Dr. Isaac Asimov named this as his favorite Dr. Who episode (though it actually comes as considerable surprise to learn that he even watched the series at all). Certainly the plotline and backstory development borrow liberally from the future society Asimov established in the Lije Bailey/R. Daneel Olivaw novels; it even works in references to the Three Laws of Robotics. The influence of an earlier book, RUR (Rossum's Universal Robots), also surfaces in exploring man's reaction to robots and their total absence of human body language (robophobia). Even the author's name, Karel Capek, is mirrored in that of the villain Taren Capel.
Newcomer director Chris Boucher (The Face of Evil) took the suggestion of longtime Dr. Who editor Robert Holmes and created an isolated, murder-mystery adventure as a vehicle to solidify the role of Leela, a companion he had introduced in the previous serial. Boucher drew from one of his favorite novels, Frank Herbert's Dune, to envisage the Storm-Mine setting. Effects director Peter Grimwade is immortalized in the episode thanks to a bit of ad-libbing by Tom Baker. Amongst the cast was David Collings as Poul, David Baile as Dask (Taren Capel), and Pamela Salem as Toos; Salem had actually been an unsuccessful applicant for the role of Leela.
Though not a milestone episode, I would name this is one of my favorite Tom Baker-era stories, largely because of its attention to detail -throwaway lines by characters reveal a rich tapestry of politics, history, and sociopolitical orders not always seen in a Doctor Who serial. We get a sense of the social ""pecking order"" on this nameless future planet from Uvanov's obvious disgust with Zilda's and Chub's family standing; at the same time we learn that the all-pervasive Company is not above covering up an employee's potentially embarrassing (or potentially expensive) past. Poul is a great study in contrasts: nobody on the Storm-Mine is the least suspicious of him until Leela turns up and likens him to a hunter. The insertion of D.84 is even more clever, and it illustrates just how inured this society has become to anything out of the ordinary. Uvanov dismisses Leela's assertion that D.84 can speak simply because ""everyone knows"" that particular class of robots can't speak.
In the same way, the crew dismisses the Doctor's theories about the murderer because ""everyone knows"" robots are incapable of such a thing. Robot behavior and robot Urban Legends are clearly at the forefront of even casual conversation, as evidenced in the opening scenes when we meet the entire crew idling away in the lounge. I also like the fact that the cast is a little more varied, racially speaking, from the usual spate of pale English actors. Helps to paint a more realistic vision of the future.
D.84 (Gregory de Polnay), the ""undercover"" agent, provides some wonderful back-and-forth dialogue with the Doctor and goes a long way toward widening the scope of the story. The robot's recount of the life of Taren Capel has made the murderer into a tragic figure before we've even figured out who he is, and it even gets to explore its own feelings of inadequacy; next thing we know it has even cracked a joke at the Doctor's expense. I always thought D.84 would make an ideal traveling companion -a sentiment I was surprised to learn was shared by many other fans. Its plaintive request to ""please do not throw hands at me"" is priceless. Definite homage to Daneel and Giskard there...
Though we, the audience, know the killer at the outset of this ""whodunit,"" it is the question of who is the puppet master that takes up the scope of the story. This is also an uncharacteristically graphic episode; there are several strangulation scenes, a disturbing shot of a dead body being buried in a downpour of gravel, and blood all over the hand of the initial killer robot. There are also some chilling pyrotechnics; for my money one of the scariest scenes depicts another of the killer robots trying to break into the command deck, calmly announcing in its polite bureaucratic monotone that everyone has to die. Another great moment comes when Leela throws her knife squarely into the chest of an attacking robot -which then casually knocks it aside and keeps on coming. It is the first time we've seen anything even approaching fear on Leela's face.
The society that has been postulated is full of cause-and-effect: the Doctor's casual line about it being ""the end of this civilization"" is clearly no exaggeration. The characters, for all their feigned ease and opulence, are clearly not wholly comfortable with this robot-dependent society they have created for themselves, and as a result there is an omnipresent creeping paranoia that lurks just under the surface for most of the storyline. The parallels to the distrustful, robot-dependent society in Asimov's Caves Of Steel are obvious: mankind has gone and made another technological breakthrough which has become an indispensable part of daily life before everyone's really had time to adjust. Likewise, the Storm-Mine's carefully-ordered life is exposed to be a powderkeg; one little deviation from ""everyone knows,"" and suddenly everybody's world is turned upside-down. This is especially apparent with Uvanov (Russell Hunter)'s newly-found ""blow 'em all up"" attitude, Poul's total mental breakdown, and Toos's hysterical sobbing (the latter also provides a great springboard for the audience to learn Leela's surprisingly tender and compassionate side).",1059955200,44,5520,5.100552486187845
369948,3,630180130X,"Doctor Who episodes -- at least during Tom Baker's run -- tended to fall into certain basic plot categories. Two common themes were: The doctor must liberate people in servitude (""Face of Evil"", ""Underworld""; ""The Sunmakers""); The doctor must uncover and foil a clever alien scheme to destroy/conquer earth (""The Android Invasion""; ""Terror of the Zygons""). A lesser-used device was the ""ten little Indians/haunted house"" approach, which we saw in the superb ""Horror of Fang Rock"" episode and here, in one of the few Tom Baker Dr. Who DVD's available, ""The Robots of Death.""

This episode is regarded by many fans as a true classic, one of the best of the whole long-running Dr. Who television show, and not merely the Baker years. I disagree. I think the story was told better in ""Fang Rock"", one of my personal favorites which also features Leela as the companion. I am very curious as to exactly how the BBC decides which Who episodes get committed to DVD, especially considering that not all of them are even out of VHS yet (what's the holdup, fellas? It's been 30 years!). But even I have to admit that few, if any, Baker-Who episodes are as dark and creepy or as well thought-out as this one, and probably none have better overall production. The robots are unusually well-designed for such a low-budget show, and when they turn evil their pleasant voices, frozen faces, and penchant for manual strangulation are downright frightening. But I'm getting ahead of myself.
Storywise, ""Robots"" is sound. The Doc and Leela land inside a giant spice-miner run by a handfull of greedy, effete, not terribly nice fortune-hunters who wear ridiculous costumes and seem to spend most of their time loafing about while a large staff of robots does most of the work. You have to take only one look at the robots to figure out that the tail is wagging the dog here, and before you know it, one of the crewmen is murdered and the Doctor and Leela, being stowaways, are of course blamed.
This starts the ""ten little Indians"" part. The spiceminer is wandering a gigantic, hostile desert of killer sandstorms and towering rock: there is no way off the ship. The humans, basically French aristocrats circa 1789 with their powdered faces and silly costumes, have no weapons and are so morally vacuous and wimpy they practically invite the robots to kill them. The robots oblige, having been tampered with by a member of the crew with a serious identity crisis, a robot fetish and a healthy dose of homicidal mania. One by one the humans get strangled, each trying to figure out who the killer is, and everyone suspecting -- of course -- our hero and his knife-wielding gal pal.
It is a nice plot device, and since it was not used very often I can let the writers off the hook for copying the fine work they did in ""Fang Rock."" My problem is mainly that the human characters on the miner are all pretty much loathsome and deserving of a good strangulation. It is hardly uncommon in Who episodes for the Doctor to be abused by the very people he is trying to save, but in this case the people just don't seem to be worth saving at all. In fact, the nicest character we meet on the ship is D84, the supposedly mute ""dumb"" robot who turns out to be a company agent. 84 should probably have read ""Message to the Oppressed"" a few more times before he chose which side he was on.
Don't get me wrong here. ""Robots"" is a good, entertaining episode with a very high creep factor. Tom Baker and Louise Jameson are very good and the writing is on par with their acting -- this is one of those episodes where Leela gets to do more than just say, ""What is it, Doctor?"" in different tones of voice, which was not always the case during her time as a companion. It is much darker than your average Tom Baker outing, and I do think the plot would have been better served by more sympathetic crew-members. DVD-wise, the extras are nothing special overall, but the audio commentary is very interesting. But overall I must admit....these are the criticisms of a nerd. Go ahead and buy the damn thing.

369976,5,630180130X,"What a season this was of Doctor Who!
A masterful story set on a monstrous harvester ship mining a planet much like the spice harvesters on Arrakis in Dune.
The ship is manned by a few humans and assisted by robots. In a direct connection with Isaac Asimov the robots are regulated by the laws of robotics which preclude any harm to humans. Mischief is afoot however as the crew begin to be assassinated one by one.
Of course, attention is focussed on the Doctor and his latest assistant Leela, while the real killer is elsewhere.
This story explores the implications of rising labor costs in an economy which permits the creation of expensive robots as they are much cheaper than human workers. As a consequence of such a policy economic ventures must be of necessity extremely profitable thus the mining.
Generally humans have come to terms with the creation of a robot society which is established to carry out their every whim, rather like the houseservants of Victorian Britain and thus the robots are taken for granted. However, there are those who are discomforted with the robots which has given rise to a robophobia. Such is the assimilation of robots into the society that it is incomprehensible to anyone that the robots could injure or cause harm.
Gradually the realisation dawns that the robots are indeed the killers and the crucial question reduces into why they are doing so and the Doctor's time is quickly running out.
There is much in this story which is worthy. Someone else has referred to the stylish and ornate appearance of the robots. Having recently seen AI the competing conceptions of the future are fascinating. The whole notion of Asimov's laws is based on the premise that it is possible to control through deep seated rules. Current research into Artificial Intelligence suggests that electronic brains could develop themselves and therefore would not be able to be restrained by previously implanted asuggestions.
Getting back to the story, it is Doctor Who at it's best. Not only a good drama, not only good science fiction but also very thought provoking especially the premise upon which the villain, the human villain that it, is based.

369978,5,630180130X,"Story #90 in the Doctor Who canon is one of the few flawless, barring continuity, and the ability to deduce the villain's identity by episode 2.  The Doctor and Leela materialize aboard a Sandminer, a large ore-gathering hovering craft sweeping across deserts.  Its crew are a bickering lot, who are at odds with each other.  Only a few seem reasonable when one scratches the surfaces underneath.
The instant our heroes land, within the first episode, three crew members are strangled to death, with red robot deactivation discs a.k.a. corpse markers, (bicycle reflectors) attached to their wrists.  Naturally they are framed and it isn't until the third episode that the remaining crew members are convinced of their innocence, during which time more people get croaked.
It turns out that a robot revolution, engineered by the mad scientist Taren Capel, is in progress, and the Sandminer is the first beachhead, and it is up to the Doctor, Leela, and the survivors to defeat it.  Capel, by the way, spent his childhood raised by robots and believed himself to be one of them.  Pretty hardcore!
The story combines elements of the French Revolution, Karel Capek's play Rossum's Universal Robots, which introduced the word ""robot,"" and the Agatha Christie mystery And Then There Were None (a favorite theme of mine, by the way, and a theme utilized in other Who stories like Horror Of Fang Rock and Terror Of The Vervoids).
Tom Baker has great lines in this one.  The most classic of which is when he tells Borg:  ""You know, you're the classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain.""  Another time, he pokes fun at Capel:  ""You look ridiculous in that outfit.  You're not half the robot your father was.""  Ouch!  To Leela:  ""To the rational mind, nothing is inexplicable, only unexplainable.""  And he is totally Holmesian in the way he and Poul try to reconstruct the death of Chubb, the first victim.
I also like the Doctor's attempting to explain to Leela the TARDIS's dimensions using two blocks.  He sets the larger one on the TARDIS column away from them and walking towards Leela, holds the smaller one so it appears larger.  It isn't silly, as Leela says dismissively; that's transdimensional engineering.
Leela quotes a Sevateem proverb to injured Toos while bandaging the latter's injured arm:  ""If you are bleeding, look for a man with scars.""  Her sense of instinct and danger really flesh out her character in her second televised story.
 The handsomely designed Art Deco robots are the most effectively realized robots I've seen in the entire series.  They must have scared young British viewers with their eerie humanoid faces, cerebrally serene Hal 9000-like voice, and red eyes glowing whenever they are ready to kill someone.  Creepy mechanical men indeed!
Second-in-command Toos' headdress is a metal framework that is halfway towards becoming a Mohawk with added hair, or a Roman helmet.  And Uvanov seems to have shredded Omega's headdress (The Three Doctors), and painted it silver.
All the performers give sterling performances, including Pamela Salem as the sensible Toos, Tania Rogers as the emotionally sensitive Zilda, and David Bailie as the rational and efficient Dask.  One of Doctor Who's finest moments and worth watching repeatedly.",1009584000,2,3309,5.018315018315018

369980,5,630180130X,"When Doctor Who first appeared here in the Sates in the late 1970's on Public Television I was so smitten by it that I took to setting up my little casette recorder by the TV set to record the audio from the shows, then listen to them while I'd do my homework or whatever and relive them in my head like a radio drama. One of my favorites to listen to was ""The Robots of Death"" and by golly if it didn't improve when I finally scored my VHS tape of this excellent adventure and could watch it again at my convenience. True science fiction, ""Robots"" is set in an un-defined future on a Sand Miner that trolls the sandstorms of an un named world that seems to be one huge desert -- the exteriors of the Miner chewing it's way across the barren landscape are amongst the most impressive effects shots from all of Doctor Who. Manning the Miner are a skeleton crew of, for the most part, vain and repugnant humans overseeing a staff of efficient, indifferent robots. The fact that there are only 8 or 9 people and about 500 robots is a sign that something is going to go wrong, but never mind. This was Leela's second episode with the Doctor, and while Louise Jameson's tantalizing animal skin outfit makes her a welcome addition to any story, her noble savage character serves well as a counterpoint to not only Baker's Who but the detatched, luxury minded humans who seem to populate the miner for one reason -- to be killed off by the robots one by one. My favorites are Poole, the Company man who isn't telling every thing he knows, and Toos, the ample chested female co-pilot of the mine who insists on wearing this helmet [hat?] that looks like it was meant for a Terry Gilliam hallucination. In fact, ALL of the human crew dress kind of oddly, wearing flowing gowns and lounge suits that don't seem to be at home on a mining platform. But no matter -- the point is that they are dependent upon the robots to do their dirty work, especially the nutcase member of the crew who starts re-programming the robots to kill off his obnoxious crewmates (who could blame him? they are a vile lot, for the most part). But the Doctor smells bigger trouble and gets involved, prophetically proclaiming that ""This isn't the only robot dependent civilization in the galaxy, you know."" The best scenes are probably the ones with the crew members nervously bickering about how to deal with the murders of their crewmates, and since the robots are all expressionless facades they really don't generate a whole lot of dread, but the story is interesting and the production design offbeat enough to keep even the jaded Sci Fi fan's interest. Even after he has listened to it 1000 times before. Highly recommended.",1007164800,13,2695,4.535934291581109
369981,5,630180130X,"Take one part of Murder on the Orient Express, add a dash of Dune and season it all with overtones of Asimov's Robot saga all the while adding the wit and intelligence that is Doctor Who at its best and you've got the classic Tom Baker era story, The Robots of Death.
Robots of Death comes out of season 14, which is arguably one of Who's best.  And Robots is one of the reasons it's so fondly remembered and revered by fans of Doctor Who.  The story strikes the right chord between overwhelming dread and an intriguing mystery.  And like the best mysteries, it will keep you guessing until the final episode when the culprit is revealed.  Chris Boucher adds his own unique twist to the time-honored murder mystery genre and makes the final solution to the problem a wholly unique one.  (To say more would be to give away too many details and it's best to see this one now knowing whodoneit. (No pun intended).
The story alone would be worth the price of the DVD. However, the BBC and WB have packed this release with some many extras that it's icing on the cake.  The commentary track by producer Phillip Hinchcliffe and writer Chris Boucher is interesting enough and contains a few interesting tidbits for long-time Who fans.  The Howard DeSilva intros and exits for the episodes are a unique part of the American broadcast of Dr. Who and are a welcome addition.  Finally, the best part--the story is presented in episodic format for the first time in the United States for a commercial release of the story--the way Dr. Who was meant to be seen.
Of course, this being DVD the picture and sound are of the highest quality--though there are some obvious signs of age in the audio track. But you've got to give them credit for working with the material available to produce a nice sounding story.
All in all, this is a MUST for any Who fan.  Great story, great Doctor, great packing and presentation. Well worth the price of admission.",1001289600,4,1935,4.553314121037464
369982,5,630180130X,"I was originally concerned when FOX gave up distribution rights of Dr Who (and other BBC programmes) to WB.  However, my fears were unjustified.
Not only are these new DVD transfers crisp and clear, there is no sign whatsoevever of the PAL-to-NTSC translation that you videophiles could readily see in the older VHS releases.  Watching ""Dr Who"" is now effectively a new experience as you've NEVER seen it before quite as crisp and clear as this!
""The Robots of Death"" is one of the 4th Doctor's more acclaimed stories - with great plot, acting, and brilliant set design - let alone the wealth of extras, this disc is worth the price.  A great choice for initial release in the US, let's hope several more will follow.",1001116800,2,717,4.674603174603175
369983,4,630180130X,"""The Robots of Death"" is a well-remembered 1977 ""Doctor Who"" adventure heavy on the gothic horror favored by the show at that time. Within another year or two, the program would return to funny monsters in ill-fitting costumes, but you won't see that here.  ""Robots"" is a logical, if unsexy choice, to be the first Tom Baker/Fourth Doctor story released on DVD.
Because the story is 24 years old, some of the special features are a stretch. Most compelling to US audiences is the featurette on Howard DaSilva, who provided cheezy and sarcastic voiceovers for the show when it was first aired State-side. Oddly, no photo of Howard is provided, but his lines are so amusing you'll play them often enough to wear out that sector of the disc.
The long, mute, test model shots of the story's ""Sandminer"" vessel, try the patience.  Many blockbuster movies like to load their DVDs with technical features, demonstrating the magic of filmmaking. While the Sandminer shots remain impressive for a small-budget show, perhaps the DVD space may have been better reserved for more informative feature, such as one about Louise Jameson (Leela), who appeared in so few DW stories.
The key feature is the commentary track by producer Philip Hinchcliffe (often credited with the show's 1970s success), and episode writer Chris Boucher. Hinchcliffe relays a few anecdotes about working with Tom Baker, but by and large the two spend the first half of the story (which neither had seen since 1977) ignoring what happens on screen, and the second half so caught up in events that the commentary nearly stops!  Hinchcliffe also keeps comparing this 1977 adventure favorably to today's big-budget Hollywood films. Well, yes.. the DVDs cost the same. However, the title of this review (spoken by Hinchcliffe, about guest-actor Russell Hunter) is more than worth the price.
The copy-editing on the actor biographies is poor. Louise Jameson's TV credits are the same as Tom Baker's, and oddly omitted is the credit guest-star David Collings' biggest role, Bob Cratchit in the 1970 ""Christmas Carol"".
Most important to the DVD is of course ""The Robots of Death"" themselves, and happily this story is worth your time.",1001030400,5,2190,5.027548209366391
369984,5,630180130X,"This is probably one of my more favorite Doctor Who (4th) episodes.  It marks Leela's second appearance as the Doctor's companion and to be honest, I wish she had stayed on longer.  I'm not the biggest fan of Miss Sarah Jane Smith.  (All her questions really get to me, ""but why doctor?"", ""how doctor?"" blah blah blah.)
This is one of the better Dr. Who episodes as far as costume and makeup is concerned.  The robots don't look shoddy or cheap (much like the Cybermen do) and the costumes for the people aboard the mining ship are kind of extravagant.  The storyline is a great whodunit of sorts.  I especially like the ""D"" (d is for dums) robot that turns out to be a Super Voc secret agent of sorts.
I'd put this at the top of my favorite Baker episodes.  I think only ""Brain of Morbius"" or ""Seeds of Doom"" surpasses this on my list.",1001030400,,836,4.32051282051282

Really enjoyed listening to the Opening and Closing narration from the extra features section. But the commentary track was awful, they hardly talked and you could tell that they did not come prepared to do this audio track (The 5 Doctors commentary track is the best!).

The darker interior reminiscent of Victorian decor seems to have partly inspired the new Who series, but at the time it was incongruous.  The murder mystery plot is also a fun rarity.  The funky odd furniture and costuming are interesting, too.  As always, the half hour segments are chock full of little moments and quotes (and perfectly embarrassing ""spaceship"" shots of power tools and toys that are enough to make one wince, but it is what it is).  The philosophic/ethical/moral/technical plot on the concept of how safe robots are/might be is par for the Doc Who course, and a darn sight more interesting than the plotless acid trip of current sci if (which in my humble opinion includes the modern Doctor Who).  Cheers.",1497830400,,772,4.9
7815984,5,630180130X,"this was great.  honestly, this is one the best companion entrances to doctor who.  leela's first scene here, where the doctor is explaining how the tardis works, is one of the best in the show. I also like how she may be a huntress and therefore comes from a more primitive way of life, but it's not just the doctor constantly educating her.  sometimes, he has something to learn from her, and she is the one who is correct.  it's a nice dynamic with their relationship.  and the story, the doctor and everything else is great too.",1496361600,,532,4.443298969072165

7815986,5,630180130X,"Another 5 Star story for the golden age of Doctor Who, one of many.
Very simple but effective concept, not entirely original but as usual the characters make it interesting.
I don't care for the amateurish makeups and the high school drama costume design. Too distracting. The sandminers look like fugitives from a deck of cards. Realistic functionality would have been better.
The makeup design for the villainous Dask is pathetic. Subtle prosthetics would have been much more sensible, something like a simple mask.
I like the quote, 'By the pricking of my thumb something wicked this way comes'. Mr. Ray Bradbury I believe, if not mistaken.
I like the robot spoken line, 'Please don't throw hands at me.' Funny.
I think this story may have been even more interesting if all the sandminer aliens were of Oriental, Indian, Latin or African ethnicity.
Very capable performance here by the lovely Louise Jameson, of course. Despite the bizarre ignorance and savagery of the Leela character Jameson's high intelligence is obvious. I really think she would have made a decent Time Lord, if given the opportunity. True talent.
The Robots appear to be inspired by Japanese design and C3PO of Star Wars.

This is a truly entertaining entry for Doctor Who, great fun overall. An authentic classic.",1491696000,,1290,5.0
