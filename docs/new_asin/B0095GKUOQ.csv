8711751,2,B0095GKUOQ,"We found this series on Netflix when my son was 3 and LOVED it! The characters on the DVD speak with a British accent, which is livable, but not as good as the American-version voice actors. The stories are wonderful. Unfortunately, the DVD constantly has trouble playing on our DVD/Blu-Ray player. It freezes it.",1505347200,,313,4.814814814814815
