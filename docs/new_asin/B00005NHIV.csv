And if another hunch can be true, the three Sailor Scouts of the Outer Solar Syster, think that Hotaru is the Sovereign of Silence! What can poor Hotaru do?! The evil Dr. Tomoe still keeps heart snatching so he can use the energy in them that will awaken this Soverign of Silence so that they can take over the world. What is Rini to do when Amara won't let Rini go near Hotaru? Can Sailor Moon still protect Hotaru without having Sailor Saturn take over her body?

1634061,5,B00005NHIV,"Sailor Saturn is the ultimate enemy. She has the Sailor Scouts Sympathy because she is a sailor but has the evil power of the Heart Stealers. Professor Tomoe is using this so Sailor Moon try's to help but gets trapped in a altered Space with her team of Sailor Scouts in the first episode of this amazing volume. In the Second, Sailor Neptune Uranus and Pluto sense the oncoming doom on earth. They try to Destroy Hotaru/Sailor Saturn but Sailor Moon and MiniMoon Save. But Neptune Uranus and Pluto won't give up that easily, they make it their new Mission to destroy Hotaru before The Power of Sailor Saturn within her awakens and she begins the destruction of the Worls. And in the third episode Mimette (the new heart snatcher) is in Danger of loosing her Job to a fellow witch in the Base of Bad Behaviour. Tellullu is the New witch and wil stop at nothing to take over the Heart snatchers for Herself. So She simply tricks Mimmette into using Eugeals old Enlarging Machine and Pulls the Plug on her (this Destroys her). It looks like the Sailor Scouts have got a new witch to deal and they Still must continue to Protect Hotaru from the other Sailors on the Mission to stop Sailor Saturn. Can Sailor Moon Manage to do all this: Protect Hotaru, Stop Tellullu and still find time to be with her true love Darien/Tuxedo Mask.

7947194,5,B00005NHIV,"Even though I have these episodes on a DVD with a dual audio option my mother wanted this tape just for the cover.  I don't blame her, as Pluto is my favorite of the Outer Soldiers/Guardians.  All 3 of the episodes on here are very good.",1421107200,,237,4.130434782608695
7947195,5,B00005NHIV,"This was the climatic moment of Sailor Moon S, where Hotaru was revealed to be Sailor Saturn. However, this episode was the infamous ""skipped episode"" when the show aired on Toonami in 2000. Cloverway stated at the time that Cartoon Network found the episode objectionable because the Daimon Heart Snatcher in the episode, Uchoten, was noticably naked, so they sent the episode back for digital painting. Of course, this confused many viewers at the time. When the episode finally aired in the reruns, the monster was shown wearing a green bra and panties, which is what you'll see on this VHS tape.",1319414400,,599,4.882352941176471

7947197,5,B00005NHIV,"This is one of the best videos!  The second episode is where the Outer Senshi try to kill Hotaru, as she is Sailorsaturn/Chinmoku no Meshiiyaa.  Chibiusa doesn't want them to.  In the first episode, Hotaru's house gets turned into another dimension!  Sailorsaturn is my fave chara...
~THE END~",1025913600,2,293,5.041666666666667
7947198,5,B00005NHIV,The first episode is about Chibiusa and Hotaru getting trapped in another dimension it is pretty good but not the best. The second episode is much better it's about the girls going to a planetarium and they also learn about the silence. I won't spoil it any further but this episode is very good and very important for later on. The last episode is about the girls trying to find Hotaru who is missing. They go to Mugen High to stop the Death Busters and Mimmet is killed by her team mate. I can't wait till volume 11!,1004572800,,518,4.295918367346939
7947199,4,B00005NHIV,"Well, These episodes are very good, These are Mimets last days to live. 3 episodes of Mimets failiors and last days to live. The witches 5 were sopposses to be on a team. I guess not...Tellu, she gets introduced in the 3rd episode beacause, of Mimets numorous failiors, Proffessor Tomoe calls Tellu and tells her she should be the new active villan. So Mimet overheard the conversation and gets jelios and tells Tellu in her Dr. Tomoe voice ""your services are not needed"", so Tellu goes anyway beacause she doesn't believe Thats really Dr. Tomoe. The Sailor Senshi try to find more info on the Death Busters. A lecture is being held so Mimet comes and sends out a computor monster with mouses. The inner senshi attack it but no affect! ""Crisis...Make-Up!!!"",""Rainbow Moon Heart Ache!!!"". The diamon is destroyed!!!. Mimet decieds to fight. She uses a growing machine that mutiplies her powers (and height) 10 fold!!! Suddenly, Tellu appears they talk for 5 seconds then she pulls the plug.(She died).... A new villan apears Tellu. Can she be the match? Can She defeat the Sailor Senshi? This is all in Vol. 11 The Messiahs revenge....  Volume 11 is when the 3 last wishes meet there fate. Episode 1: Tellu makes evil flowers and sell them for 10 yen! (10 cents) Hotaru buys one for Rini so the senshi suspect her for trying to suck Rini's pure heart.
Episode 2: After Tellus defeat, Vinyl stepps in and uses computors to steal pure hearts. She collects alot!
Final Episode The last episode is cypryn and petoral battle the senshi. Rini is held hostage and her heart is stolen! This is a very good volume for SM fans
