8588128,5,B00002NDLM,"Gundam 0083 is the best Gundam series I have seen to date. The mecha desings are great, the characters are realalistic, and the plot is superb. It does the job of telling you how the titans were formed, and bridging the 7 year gap between Gundam and ZGundam. Like most Gundams the plot is very dark and little children should not watch it. But ""thanks"" to Cartoon Network you can take a very vilent and gory scene and make it so little kids are aloud to watch it. The stollen nucular war head should tell you something unless they edit that out. Along with the colony drop. If you like fight scenes this has plenty of good ones and it also has a little bite of a love story. All in all it is a great OVA. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up good all aroud.",999907200,,741,4.117241379310345
8588129,5,B00002NDLM,"This series is the first Gundam series I have ever watched. I've always  liked the concept of Gundam where giant robots were depicted as realistic  weapons in war and not Power Ranger-esque fighting robots. This series did  exactly that through its top notch animation and mechanical design. I would  say that the story for the series was very involving and complex but  remained interesting. I was crazy enough to actually buy the whole entire  series spending lots but I don't regret the purchase at all. I would say  that the only problem  I had with it, is that the ending was unsatisfying  and didn't really tie up the whole story. It didn't really end with a big  bang that I was expecting but it did make alot of sense. Overall , there  was plenty of action and story to satisfy most Gundam fans and the English  dubbing at times was absolutely hilirious!( I mean that in a good way)Go  buy this set now!!!!",965520000,5,914,4.533742331288344
