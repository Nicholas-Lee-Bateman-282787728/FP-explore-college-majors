8509042,5,B0072VFXE8,"I absolutely loved the way in which this marvellous violinist shared a great part of his life with viewer. It was a completely true and 'off the cuff' account of his view of life. Short video clips of other great violinists of the past were included. His 'jamming' with musicians like the Beatles, Dizzy Gillespie, Stephan Grapelli and even a modern rock band was most enjoyable",1368316800,,378,4.742424242424242
8509043,5,B0072VFXE8,"Dear young collegues of the up-and-coming generation, please have the courage to be yourselves, to take risks and not be copies of your recordings or of other's. Practice your instrument in order to free yourself from any psycho-technical constraint, to be able to create when you play. Listen to your inner ear, which is connected directly to your hearth and spirit, the one that tells you what you feel is you! And the one you don't feel isn't you. Remember that a beautiful ""wrong"" note by a Kreisler, a Thibaud, a Casals or a Callas is worth more than a thousand so-called ""right"" notes and that playing that is hygienically and clinically correct is not necessarily a sign of good health!
Take heart! Good health to you!
