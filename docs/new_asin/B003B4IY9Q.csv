If you slept through history class in high-school or college you won't while watching this History Channel series on how the United States broke free from our roots across the pond.  The enactments and use of computer graphics are an excellent touch to draw the viewer into the events that birthed our nation.  This series should be made a History class requirement of any part of schooling as it will provide a means to understand the whys and wherefores of the origins of the United States. The detail about the various characters shaping the history of this country is facinating. Definitely a keeper and a series that I highly recommend to everyone!",1272153600,4,690,4.939655172413793
