8575452,5,B00BY8DI74,"""The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe"" is an early, unflinching look at the author from a perspective not necessarily so drenched in romanticism.  It shows all of Poe's flaws--impetuous, anti authoritarian, self centered, a drunk and impractical to a fault--along with the tenderness of his idealism in his relations with women (especially his cousin, Virginia Clemm).

John Shepherd did a fine, fine job portraying the author.  This is the real Poe: the one who would dare to argue with his boss when his wife was sick and dying and he had to pay the bills, and did so with full conviction. Also stellar is Linda Darnell as Virginia. (a.k.a Lenore.) She loves being the muse for Poe's work right up until she dies, and does not echo one complaint.

Better, along with the five minutes or so of Klaus Kinski at the beginning of ""Web of the Spider"",  than anything else you will see on the ill fated Edgar.",1451779200,,897,4.616352201257862

8575456,4,B00BY8DI74,"I love this film. It is surprisingly accurate on several points in Poe's biography that are usually overlooked. The title is accurate but misleading. By that, I mean this film isn't just about the women with whom Poe had a romantic connection. It's also about his love for justice, the lack of love shown to him by his foster father and of course his love for both writing and, alas, liquor.",1406678400,7,391,4.52112676056338
8575457,5,B00BY8DI74,"Like many people I suppose, I was first introduced to the name of Edgar Allan Poe by those Vincent Price (and Ray Milland) horror movies of the early sixties:- The Fall of the House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum, Premature Burial, The Raven, The Haunted Palace, The Masque of the Red Death, and The Tomb of Ligeia, although any similarity between the movies and the works of Poe was usually purely coincidental.

Then, in 1967, came that horror anthology, 'Torture Garden' starring, among others, Burgess Meredith, Jack Palance, and Peter Cushing.  Palance and Cushing appeared in the final tale, 'The Man Who Collected Poe,' and in case you haven't seen it I won't spoil it for you by telling you how Poe was 'collected.'

Which brings us to the present and the 'The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe' now made available in the '20th Century Fox Cinema Archives' collection.

I have to admit that I had never heard of this movie.  Add to this the fact that there are no big names in it (apart from the lovely Linda Darnell), and the additional fact that I was put off by the title, I didn't know whether to buy it or not.  After all, the aforementioned horror movies lead one to expect something dark and dramatic, which are hardly promised by 'The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe.'  I certainly wasn't interested in a soppy love story or romcom.

However, having taken the plunge and bought it, I can highly recommend it.  The film is most emphatically not a love story, dealing, as it does, with Poe's life struggles:- his education and early career, his bouts of drunkenness, and his fight to establish a copyright law.  Of course, it covers the women in his life, but the women are not, despite the title, the focal points of the film.  There are the usual degrees of accuracies and inaccuracies that one comes to expect from these classic biopics, but overall it is a very enjoyable foray into the world of Edgar Allan Poe.

And one final point.  Several of these releases from the '20th Century Fox Cinema Archives' collection have suffered from very poor transfers, and I should know because I have bought several of them.  But here, at last, is a very good transfer, probably one of the best in the series so far.  This is why I have given the movie five stars - four for the film, and an extra one for having a decent transfer.",1369267200,20,2326,4.5311004784688995
