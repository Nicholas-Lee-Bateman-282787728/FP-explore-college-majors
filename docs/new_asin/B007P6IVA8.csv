If you liked Angel and the Badman then also watch Tall in the Saddle these are two of my favorite John Wayne movies of this era.  Among others :)",1405382400,,233,4.043478260869565

5102662,5,B007P6IVA8,"Excellent remastering of two great classic westerns by DigicomTV. Great audio and video quality on both films.

Angel and The Badman:  Lots of action, romance and intrigue. A really must see starring great actors of the time.

The Outlaw:  Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) welcomes his old friend Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) to Lincoln, New Mexico. Doc is looking for his stolen horse and finds it in the possession of Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel). Despite this, the two gunfighters take a liking to each other, much to Pat's disgust. This does not prevent Doc from trying to steal the horse back late that night, but Billy is waiting for him outside the barn.

The rest of the movie, you'll have to watch for yourself.  A real thriller. Lots of action! And, of course, the luscious and vivacious sex kitten, Jane Russell. What red-blooded man could resist her charms? A real must see!!!!",1385424000,,893,4.803921568627451

8520215,3,B007P6IVA8,Things have changed so much in the movies it is really fun to watch the old ones. I had seen The Outlaw when it first came out and the only reason I can see for Jane Russell playing the female lead was that she was Howard Hughes girlfriend.
