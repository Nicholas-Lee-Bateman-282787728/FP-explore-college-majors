6807586,5,B00PHL8VQW,"Mark Landis is a hybrid. He is a fine art folk hero working in specific conditions with an important goal.

I've volunteered in museums, worked at the art council, and slung paint myself, though nothing on the level of Mr. Landis' exhibition. ""Art is for everyone!"" is the management/p.r mantra from the lowliest eager docent to the smuggest most entitled executive director.

People of a certain background (in the south, it's always rich whites) believe arts organizations belong to them. They ""open doors"" to lesser groups deemed worthy in proportion to the generosity of their hosts. This is a double fiction. Gatekeepers pretend to be knowledgeable, wealthier, and more influential than their income or intellect would otherwise suggest.

Because real or imagined fortune smiles, they take credit for student artists and other genuinely talented professionals working in the field who must -- surely must! -- wish to be among the revered pillars of the community like them someday.""By the way, young sir or lady, may I tell you, pretty and gifted as you are, how much you remind me of ME when *I* was your age?""

This is small town America. It's the attitude of insular elites in large cities. Horse and pony shows do not benefit the arts or arts education. Saying, ""The arts are for everyone!"" places those too pure to study in positions of authority. They know it all. Whatever ""it"" is. Art is held hostage. Ernest patrons are human shields in the standoff.

Our forger is the honest broker here. The fraudsters are ""experts"" and devotees proving how little they understand of what they defend -- for authenticity's sake. Landis is like a white hat hacker or the former crook; now present day security consultant, Frank Abagnale, Jr. There's a hint of Sacha Baron Cohen with pleasing echoes of Mike Bonanno and Andy Bichlbaum's Yes Men (I'm warmed up n' swingin' here) and the Tibetan lama clapping his hands in the face of a novice. Change is the only permanent. PAY ATTENTION!! The ego is punctured.

I'm not accusing everyone of a certain age and skin color involved in the arts of being insincere. These pranks skewer a subset gossiping about So-and-So's donation from Sotheby, Christie's and a private collection belonging to some cousin, business partner, roommate, army buddy of your grandad that's carefully shepherded into public view because of residual clout and social graces. ""We still GOT IT. We're running this show!""

Artwork exists now for the same reason it came into being in the first place: If you're a cave artist, a Medieval monk in his cell, or Mark Landis gathering supplies at Walmart and daubing tiny dots of paint under a magnifying glass from his tiny apartment in Mississippi. There's an error where someone interviewed in the film says, ""People have a tactile experience,"" seeing the genuine article. The tactile element belongs to whoever touches the canvas with pencils, brushes, and their flesh and blood fingertips.

Outrage, admiration, chuckles or disbelief prove the same fact. The viewer can be viscerally moved whether the work is original or not. Landis' compositions may not be his, but he does the job of a real artist and generates output in manner which is entirely unique.

Art isn't created by snobs for snobs. Artists are clever, thoughtful, and patient. They want to be considered in similar detailed ways. This is why art is cultivated and preserved. Mark Becker encourages the maestro to paint his own pieces and present work under his own name. It's like telling Michael Jordan to focus on baseball or golf.

I disagree Landis has been ""shopped"" and his career ended. I hope ""Art and Craft"" advertises his tremendous ability to larger audiences and delivers his calling card to cut-outs who will help further an expanded mission. It would thrill me to pose as a monied trustafarian nitwit, remove a Mark Landis' forgery from the passenger seat of my rented sports car, and squire that baby through the front door of any gallery.

For those wishing to shame the man, could the documentary itself be another example of the sly fox teasing guard dogs in order to make off with an even larger hen?",1422316800,,4152,4.917142857142857

6807588,5,B00PHL8VQW,"LOVED THIS FILM!!!  What a fascinating portrait of this Mark Landis, one of the most prolific art forgers in US history, and he's not in it for the money!  It's so interesting because according to the FBI, he hasn't committed a crime because he has only donated his copies to museums, not sold them.  Smart, funny, crazy story. The score is also really great. I highly recommend it.  I also loved PRESSURE COOKER which is a documentary by two of the same filmmakers of ART AND CRAFT.

6807589,5,B00PHL8VQW,"I enjoyed this movie very much. While, perhaps, one could dismiss Landis as just a crackpot forger with a need to satisfy his fragile ego, I find myself sympathizing with him and his ""craft"". This film is as much about Landis' motivation to do what he does as it is about the forgeries. Well worth watching.",1419811200,6,307,4.5

6807603,5,B00PHL8VQW,"This unfolds the story of Mark Landis and his ""life's work"" of philanthropic fine art forgery. As someone said in the movie, it has become a kind of performance art piece. He uses his ""gifts"" (that may be symptomatic of a spectrum of various psychological diagnosis) to their best advantage. His intentions are to be glamorous and generous just like a suave art collector in an old movie. He plays the part well. He's an accomplished liar and and actor with a rich fantasy life. Another story woven through the film, is that of Matt ; who has become obsessed with Mark and blames him for losing his job. His behavior with Mark at the gallery showed so such anger and intensity, it made for some tense moments and illustrated the difficulty he suffers from his admittedly obsessive nature. I hope they will both come to terms with the fine art of letting go; Mark letting go of his need to imitate a life, and Matt letting go of his resentment. I wish them well.",1496275200,2,961,4.497142857142857
6807604,1,B00PHL8VQW,"Personally, I found the movie plodded along and the subject matter garnered no sympathy from me. He forged paintings and then donated them to some major museums. The Feds couldn't stop him because he didn't take any money for them. He just duped a bunch of high-level curators and made them look incredibly stupid. In a sense, he veiled a bad motive under a good one. But did that really have anything to do with mental illness? He had insight into what was wrong with what he did. The film was neither cute nor informative. Just a sad waste of time about a sad waste of time.",1496102400,,576,4.392523364485982

6807619,5,B00PHL8VQW,"A fascinating story that in the end makes you wonder who has the biggest problem: (1) the troubled ""star"" who likes arts and crafts; (2) the OCD art curator who cannot stop pursuing the ""philanthropist; (3) the viewer, who has gotten gloriously sucked into a story in which it becomes painfully obvious that otherwise paid skeptics/critics are very likely to look less closely at a free donation than that for which they have to pay; (4) or again, the viewer who wonders in the end if he/she hasn't been used by both the protagonist and the documentarian.  We never really understand enough of Mark Landis's childhood background to understand what fundamentally shaped him to a man living off welfare who has decided upon a career of art philanthropy.

6807646,5,B00PHL8VQW,"Of course as an artist myself I am biased in the sense of appreciating everything written about art. However, this cinematographic essay about the infamous eccentric forger is unique in the annals of the history of the donation of his forged artworks. The billionaires usually purchase and donate only because they profit from it through tax deductions. Who has ever heard of a forger donating their art for the sake of narcissistic glory of pleasing if not their mother then their name recognition by proxy.",1470787200,,508,4.988235294117647
6807647,4,B00PHL8VQW,"Landis is like a character in a Flannery O'Connor story, but the story of his discovery and pursuit by Matthew Leininger appears to be more like that of Captain Ahab pursuing the whale.

Mark Landis has a talent for creating believable, low-budget reproductions of minor works of art.  He also has a severe mental disorder, one feature of which is the pathological compulsion to create art forgeries good enough to fool experts, and to repeatedly re-enact the acceptance of his talent by presenting his forgeries for *donation* to museums and collections across the country.  That he offers to donate his work and not sell it is a distinction that keeps his behavior from being a crime.

Matthew Leininger was a museum registrar who caught Landis in the act of donating a couple of forgeries to the Oklahoma City Museum of Art.  Leininger seems to have dedicated his life, maybe even sacrificed it, to exposing Landis as a master forger and a dangerous art fraud.

I got the impression there is either more, or less, to Matthew Leininger than the movie presents, for example, what is the real story behind his departure from the Oklahoma City Museum of Art; it's not really clear, but I was left with the impression that he might have been fired for his fixation of Landis, a fixation that didn't serve the museum, and ultimately took over Leininger's attention. Why is Leininger still unemployed?  We see him working on various projects related to exposing Landis's frauds, and we see Leininger's little daughter skipping and climbing around him, already able to read Mark Landis's name, identify a photo of Landis. Where is the girl's mother? Has Leininger's obsession even destroyed his marriage?

At any rate, it's a thoroughly engaging movie about a couple of tragic characters.  Favorite moment in the movie: as an encapsulation of the kind of fraud Landis is, we're shown Landis filling an empty Milk of Magnesia bottle with some kind of ripple, and assuring the film-maker that he'll only take his slug of the stuff *after* he's arrived at his destination, and not before driving.  The bottle is a perfect little con, ultimately pointless, from a man who really just wants to soothe himself, without harming anyone else.",1470700800,3,2228,4.917333333333334

6807701,5,B00PHL8VQW,"Tremendous piece of film making.  Capturing a rare, complicated and talented individual.  This film is not about defrauding, stealing or nefarious undertakings.  It is a portrait of man who is able to function while suffering from intense mental illness, alone, without his anchor, his mother.  The few folks who were hurt and angry that they were duped, generally moved past the ""fraud"" aspect, into on of shock and awe.  To an extreme in the case of the man who became obsessed with the need to stop Mr. Landis, cost him is job.  So interesting observing this gentleman meeting his obsession, yet Mr. Landis had no interest in him.  It felt like he was going to burst out of himself as he shadowed Mr. Landis though out his appearance at the exhibition.  Perhaps he understood who he was dealing with, a gentle soul, a mentally challenged adult with a talent.

I found this documentary to be extremely riveting, far from boring.  My guess is that those who bored, did not get the message of the documentary.  It is an observation, an opportunity to explore adults with severe mental illness, coping skills and survival.  The art, was simply crafts to him.",1449360000,,1157,4.758793969849246

I did appreciate the chase and the unfolding discovery of just a man who knows himself and how copying art to give away may complete himself in a world we do not always understand.  I'm really proud of his honesty in front of the camera.

6807762,5,B00PHL8VQW,"""Art and Craft"" documentary tells a real time story of Mark Landis who whole life focuses on creating copies of minor paintings, and art master pieces in other media.  He thrills to test his work by offering them for free to museums knowing they will evaluate the works authenticity.  All goes well until one art registrar, Matthew Leininger noticed the art he evaluated was not original, in fact, the same exact pieces were offered and accepted by other museums in the country.  A museum employee, Leininger makes it his mission to uncovering this fraud. His frustration to stop him dead in his tracks turns into an obsession that leads to a dismal by his employer.  Because all the art Landis presented to museums did not involve the exchange money, it was not judged a crime.
The documentary presents a interesting perspective of a copyist who excels at creating art painting replicas pretending to be original.  So long as he had something to copy no one approaches his level of expertise (except for those who have exceeded it and go undetected).  On the other hand, if he had to interpret an experience real or imagine in an original painting he would incapable of executing it.  He claimed after studying photography, he could not take a picture.  His motivation to copy a piece over and over becomes his real art, and his payday are those judgement times when his work is accepted as original master pieces.  He probably gets an easy pass because there is no money involved, and no real need to hold his donated work to the expense standards a monied piece would demand.
As for his nemesis, Matthew Leininger, one easily understands the pitfalls one faces who does his job too well.  He becomes the person exposing his museum employer as the naked emperor whose ineptitude in assaying original art becomes a bald fact.  He becomes a pariah in the museum art world and pays a price for being over diligent.
Thinking about the resulting situation for both these characters, and their understanding of museum laxity in evaluating art, they would do well to form a consulting company to both museums and insurance companies evaluating the originality of master pieces in play in the art market.",1443657600,,2198,4.803713527851459

6807767,5,B00PHL8VQW,"The director has done a superb job putting this documentary together since it matches Landis story. I am into art and architecture and wanted to see Landis's artwork. The way that Landis moves his brush is a testimony to his gift, a painter and an artist. It seems from the reviews that everyone wants to know the real story of what Landis is up to... It is simple. Art is a tool for Landis to be someone, someone who can get attention, so Landis can have a dialog with humans since Landis has none, no dialog with anyone, not a single soul. Why he could not get the best of his talent in some other form other than giving away his art away, once again it is simple, he is not after getting a show, or having his art hung anywhere since that is not communication, Landis is after recognition WITH a dialog  that he controls. When he gives away his art, he is in charge, in charge of his meetings and in reality Landis is more intelligent, smart and convincing than all those directors with high paying jobs who fall for Landis's pitch regardless how much more education, degrees, recognition or what ever they may happen to have, since Mark is the one who get the better of them. There is nothing else in there, some do selfie, some blog all over the the Web since they want interaction, Landis gets to meet people through his paintings instead of sitting home and watching stupid TV all by himself, ALONE all his life...

Necessity is the mother of invention, and sometimes stepmother of deception His paintings are his deception for setting those meetings and his invention is creating time for the interaction, the only thing that offers him sanity. I like to see the prescription list of all those reviewers who have chosen to analyze the mental stage of Landis, what a shame. Hang in there Mark, you are doing real well, running your life all by yourself with whatever you've got. Don't give up.",1443225600,2,1900,4.504347826086956

6807773,5,B00PHL8VQW,"THIS is what art is all about. You might get derailed by calling Mark Landis 'Forger' or 'Mentally Ill' but all I see it sublime and subtle genius. The artists and art professors at the gallery show are severely missing comprehending the nature of Landis' art, because they have been trained to think of art as something that can be displayed in a gallery or museum. Landis' art isn't that he can paint or draw well. His art is incomplete without the theater of making the donations by playing a role. THAT is his art. Him signing his own name on a painting, as suggested by those he meets in the gallery, is a bit like an actor displaying the Playbill for his theater performance and saying that the Playbill is the art.

Landis seems completely self-aware, coherent, and intentional. I would consider myself lucky to have been a part of his art, unlike the museum fellow who is downright frightening in his threatening mannerisms and controlling nature. I really hope that guy sits down and thinks it through and has a wonderful belly-laugh at the absurdity of the big picture, because it is pretty darn funny.

We are presented with a carefully edited film that no doubt emphasizes somethings and de-emphasizes other things, so it is up to you to decide what kind of person Landis is. Art has grown beyond formal definitions like 'painting' and 'sculpture' and 'theater'. Landis, and others like Banksy, and the interactive work at burn festivals, are right on the bleeding edge of what we sense in our souls is authentic beings fully immersed in their compulsions, to the point where they may appear like criminals or crazies to those of us blinded by conventionality and aching to be A#1 conformists.

Thanks to the filmmakers for making Mr. Landis' work more widely known. I haven't felt this giddy about another person's creativity in many years.",1441843200,5,1853,4.766355140186916

6807777,5,B00PHL8VQW,"I would never have run into this fascinating documentary had not an artist friend of mine told me about it, but it is worth watching not only for its artistic interest but also as a portrait of a unique American eccentric. Mark Landis is an art forger but a most unusual one: instead of selling the forgeries he donates them to important art museums who accept them thankfully. It's as odd a case as one will ever run into, and Mr. Landis is under no scrutiny from law enforcement because without trying to sell the forgeries as originals, he has violated no laws.

His many fraudulent donations were discovered by Matthew Leininger, former Chief registrar at the Cincinnati Museum of Art, when he discovered that several other museums owned a work that Landis had donated to Cincinnati. He then dedicated himself to exposing the forgeries and eventually lost his job because of it. The museum claimed he was spending too much time on the case and neglecting his other duties, but it becomes clear as time passes and some museums still refuse to acknowledge they accepted forgeries, that the gullibility of the staff at many notable museums is a sore point.

Even stranger is Mr. Landis himself, a seemingly simple and naive man who is on medication prescribed for mental problems and may be a type of autistic savant with one particular skill. He seems totally unaware that what he is doing is essentially wrong, and is careless enough to make multiple copies of the same work and then donate ""it"" to multiple museums. He seems to do it for the attention and special treatment he gets from important museum people around the country. Although he is a relatively good copier, he's far from careful, as he is shown actually creating a copy, sometimes simply painting over scans of the works from art books. These would never hold up to the scrutiny they would receive if millions were to be spent on them.

Yet one can't help but forgive the museum people, who often receive bequests (the paintings are usually said to be from Landis' mother's estate), from simply taking the proffered million dollar gifts without investigation. One also can't help but forgive Mr. Landis, who simply isn't quite all there. This is a truly odd case that makes a totally engrossing documentary.",1441497600,,2276,4.786259541984733

Perhaps the strangest thing about it is that the pictures were made with colored pencil on top of copies made at Kinkos.  They were put into Walmart frames with backs aged by pouring on coffee.

I think that is the purely striking thing in this one. My guess is that every single thing this guy does is an act. It is a very interesting story. It's a documentary so I could care less about how it was made, it's a bit boring but still fascinating if you are someone who has an art background. I think he has pulled this off for so long because these museums didn't do their jobs.

  In my opinion this was kind of posing a question of whether this guy is good, evil or just is off his rocker crazy. I think there is some what of a mix of all three. My best guess is that somewhere along the line of all those options. I also think he was a talented guy who never left the womb fully and now that family is gone, he is just trying to sneak his work in somewhere, and what a better place than a museum if you can't sell in a gallery or aren't doing it for the money.

6807965,5,B00PHL8VQW,"I found this movie very interesting. Mark Landis allowed us to view the life of someone who is truly gifted, yet mentally unstable - due to schizophrenia and other mental ailments that he himself touched upon. I felt sympathy for him, he seemed lost after losing his mother, and life in his mind, was a series of clips from TV shows. It reminded me of a real life ""Cable Guy"" (the character Jim Carrey played in that movie).  But Mark Landis wasn't interested in making friends so much as ""helping"" people enjoy beautiful works of art - even though they weren't by the authentic artists.

I understand that forgery is illegal, but I found myself annoyed by the so-called art sleuth who seemed obsessed with Landis after having been duped himself. He seemed to have no compassion for the mental state of Landis, and I actually felt worried for Landis' safety at their 'meeting'.

Overall, this was a fascinating movie about a gifted but troubled man, I'm glad I watched it.",1436745600,,972,4.6725146198830405

Also interesting that the big meeting of the hunter and hunted at the end turns out to be....  well, watch it if you enjoy art and what makes one piece of art seem more valuable/desirable than another.

6808098,5,B00PHL8VQW,Wonderful documentary.  The sort of crazy twist of the whole thing isn't even shown in the trailer... so I won't say anything here.  The fact that he's pulled this off for over 30 years is mind blowing.  His copies are sometimes as basic as using a copy machine or pencils instead of chalk to mimic pieces that are hundreds of years old is a riot!  He's so low key and into the art - the way it ends is an added bonus.  Can't recommend this documentary enough.

Their trigger buttons were on: Money and Paintings and so they accepted with ease the 'gift' offered. Who is really at fault? In this amazing age of data in an instant, museums and galleries and an obligation to check the authenticity of what was being offered to them.

6808254,4,B00PHL8VQW,"Excellent documentary about an outstanding ""copy"" artist (forgery implies art for sale). Eccentric artist (probably with Asperger's Syndrom)
and lonely childhood who made the best of his gifts of copying art masters.  Very seldom he did original art work, more's the pity.
This sensitive documentary tells his story as a philanthropist. Most of his donations were to major art museums in the Southern USA, but
none in Texas, for some reason...or not found yet. This is a doc that every artist should see as it shows how important it is NOT to do as
he does. Although he is not in jail, it shows how the experts were duped and the ""loss"" to the public. Can we surmise that the so called
Public review of his copies is of a lesser ""crime"". He was so good at doing copies that the student painter or draftsman could still learn
something from observing the pieces...brush strokes, composition, but probably not color. Color being incorrect as he used color photos
to copy which are not true to the original. Some art books, as art students know, are very inadequate as to true colors.
A sad story and a real loss to the art world, both financially if the museums they can resell his donated works to raise funds. There are
undoubtedly more of his fakes out there....buyer beware!  Even if he didn't gain a financial reward for ""sales"", he may have taken money or
like funds for hotels, meals, etc. Let's hope not.",1432944000,,1410,4.636

This is a chance to get to know someone who is authentically ill, albeit harmless, when all is said and done.  This documentary unfolds at a pace that reminds me of the TV show, ""Lost,""  You are introduced to a complex character and then piece by piece the puzzle starts to fill in.  The camera likes to scan the room during interviews, picking up a clue on a table,  A picture on the wall.  Mark Landis watches television all day long, as he works his ""art and craft.""  He is alone, and his entire world seems to take place in the context of television programs he has absorbed over the years.  The directors of this documentary have done a really good job of recognizing and highlighting that.  I find myself thinking about the film - even weeks later.  That...to me...is the sign of a good movie, documentary or not.  Art and Craft was on the short list for an Oscar nomination.  Too bad it did not quite make that cut (I am sure there are plenty of politics in those circles) but if the producers and directors keep turning out work like this, it is only a matter of time.  Congratulations Jennifer Grausman!",1427328000,14,1206,4.497695852534562

6808417,4,B00PHL8VQW,"A wonderful, beautifully rendered documentary. Viewers get a snapshot of Landis, a mischievous art ""copier,"" and the forces that compel him to copy great works of art and bequeath them to galleries and museums as the real thing.",1426291200,,228,5.026315789473684
6808418,4,B00PHL8VQW,"I wouldn't call this guy a great art forger so much as he's a skilled mimic who's good at interpersonal deception. As the documentary explains, his forgeries are actually extremely easy to detect if someone attempts to do so. The real trick is that Landis has a lot of convincing characters he uses to persuade museums to take on his artwork. So - if you're looking for a story about the more technical aspects of forgery and detection, you'd probably prefer episodes of the BBC show ""Fake or Fortune"".

That's not to say this is a bad documentary, it's just not what you might expect when you read descriptions calling Landis the greatest art forger of our time. In reality, the greatest forger is probably someone who's gone largely undetected so far. Truly great forgeries take much more work to detect.

What's interesting about this movie, though, is that Landis truly is a talented artist. Although he's working with inauthentic materials (Hobby Lobby frames and colored pencils, even), he produces work that convinces a lot of art museum employees who either lack the time, resources, or motivation to perform the most basic checks for authenticity. Although most of the deception occurs at smaller museums, the film mentions that some of his work has appeared in many of the largest art museums in the US. In some cases, the exact same work is donated to multiple museums. Insanity! Isn't there some database where even the laziest and time-hungry employees could search out the works to make sure they weren't claiming ownership of duplicates? It really makes you wonder...

The bulk of the film focuses on Landis and his personal history. It's a portrait of mental illness coupled with breathtaking talent. It can be a little slow at times, and it lacks structure that could have made it flow a bit better, but it's still very interesting.",1426204800,5,1849,4.863492063492063

6808429,4,B00PHL8VQW,"Art forgery is a major theme here of course, but this is really a documentary about mental health and the genius that can sometimes accompany those afflicted by psychiatric problems or mental disease.

Real life forger Mark Landis is no ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain-Man-HD/dp/B005SHTXN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain Man [HD</a>]"", but he is mentally ill. The documentary points to schizophrenia and hints at many other potential ailments - an immense hodge-podge really only limited by some minor misdiagnosis. Landis is not the only one, as art detective Matt Leininger and many others become more than slightly obsessed with Landis himself.  It is only natural to get wrapped up into what makes Landis tick (whose father died when he was young and whose mother served a central role in his life), but just as Landis ended up getting addicted to a ""high"" by pretending to be a philanthropist giving away valuable works of art, many others in the film end up just as addicted trying to determine how many and what kinds of fakes Landis was able to get squirreled away in museums across the country.

Despite the lies and anger, most of the people end up being likable to a certain degree, generating sympathy because of a recognition of a human condition that craves to be useful and noticed (which is in many ways Landis' primary motivator).

For as fascinating as the story is, it sometimes feels just on the verge of petering out.  Many important questions go unanswered (did Landis ever have any siblings?  was he ever married?  where does he get his money?), but in the end, just as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Searching-For-Sugar-Man-HD/dp/B00B49L7Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Searching For Sugar Man [HD</a>], one must accept that a documentary that is essentially a mini-biography on a living person can only go as far as the ""star"" of the film is willing to share.  Just as things feel like they are meandering we are able to culminate in a very satisfying exhibition of his work at the Cincinnati Art Museum. I think most viewers at this point are clapping for him in their hearts.

Critics are pushing the ""greatest art forger"" of our time angle with this, which I suppose is only natural from a marketing standpoint.  However, Elmyr de Hory did it almost as well and just a little bit earlier than Landis.  With Landis drawing much of his inspiration from the past, I have little doubt that Elmyr is someone that Landis is intimately familiar with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fake-The-Story-of-Elmyr-De-Hory-the-Greatest-Art-Forger-of-Our-Time/dp/0070320470/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fake! The Story of Elmyr De Hory, the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time</a>. Surely in forgery circles imitation is the greatest form of flattery.

8688026,4,B00PHL8VQW,"Mark Landis has a compulsion to donate fake paintings to museums. That is of itself quite interesting and well explored here. But what its mostly missing, merely alluded to a few times, is how and why he got away with this for so long. Should museums be so eager and unquestioning when receiving benevolences? What makes them so gung-ho to get the get? Mark himself alluded to liking the attention of museums vying for his pieces. A deeper look into that world would have benefited this film greatly. Barring that even a cursory explanation of why museums are reluctant to publicly address fakes would have been informative and given more depth to the story. Alas, none of that is measurably present in the movie, and the want is keenly felt by the end.  This could have been a great documentary. Its very good, but misses its chance to be great by not exploring more of the reasons Mark got away with this for so long.",1533686400,,919,4.569696969696969
