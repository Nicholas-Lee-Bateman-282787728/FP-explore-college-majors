I've compared these DVDs with others and find these the best. What I like most is that they show multiple views and take out all the mystery of where your feet, arms, etc. are supposed to be.  They also give lots of helpful tips that I would never have thought of, never having been to a dance studio before.  Ok, sure the Lamperts aren't the ""hippest"" looking instructors, but if you want solid, clear teaching, you can't beat these DVDs.",1199577600,2,580,4.392523364485982
8163669,5,B000LQK9TK,Very well done instruction CD. Not exciting but they give you the steps in a straight forward manner.  I would recommend this CD to anyone wishing to learn or improve their dancing.,1184457600,,181,4.65625
