8127663,3,B000FZEQUK,"Love love love reading rainbow but this is not a favorite, despite lots of potential.  My 4 year old girl who is sensitive was scared of the stories of stranded animals and the overall theme was quite environmentalist.  I'm all for protecting our earth but I feel this show went a little too much into conservation at the expense of knowledge and conveying the magesty and fascination of the animals- allowing the children to WONDER (and develop a love of the earth and it's creatures incidentally).  That ""wonder"" is normally a strongpoint of the series I think.  This one didn't live up to its potential- Just ok.  Try Desert Life instead- it's awesome!",1427241600,,655,4.761061946902655

8127666,5,B000FZEQUK,"We have four of these dvd's.  Different people read two stories.  In this particular video the stories are true.  Then LeVar talks about ocean life in a captivating manner.  My children watch these videos over and over.

There are also extras that are great fun to watch.  One of them has LeVar riding a train, another he is learning to fly an airplane.  Everybody really enjoys these videos.",1255305600,2,392,4.676470588235294
