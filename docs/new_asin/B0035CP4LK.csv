8432888,5,B0035CP4LK,"In a day when thin-pak and stack-pak collections of anime series are the norm, it is nice to see a high quality chipboard boxed set release from Media Blasters. The artbox that these 3 DVDs come in is very nice and sturdy and the artwork looks great. Genshiken 2 picks up where the first series left off (I'd definitely recommend picking up the original series first, or read the first 3 or 4 volumes of the manga, well read the whole thing because its amazing). This series is perfect for anyone who has ever belonged to a college anime club, or almost any anime fan for that matter. Overall I gave this DVD set 5 stars because it is an amazing series and a nicely put together collection.",1277251200,3,690,4.3984375
