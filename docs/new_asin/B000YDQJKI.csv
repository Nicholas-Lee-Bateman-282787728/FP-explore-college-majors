I haven't figured out how to return a digital download, but am working on it. There are several PRIME videos that are much, much better, and no cost to Prime members. .",1438214400,,321,4.732142857142857
8232254,3,B000YDQJKI,"I'm so bummer, wished I had rented this before I bought.  It starts out with what seemed like a long lecture about Sun Salutations, nice to know, except now I'll have to figure out how long, and fast forward every time before I do this...(part of not keeping up with my yoga practice is time crunch...just once I'd like a video I can turn on, and just do...talk to me later while I'm in Savasana...)

The video then goes through 3 variations...the first one painfully slow...I was expecting and hoping for a guided morning, start the day, Sun Salutation video, I could get up, go through the salutations, and move into the day...this isn't it...or maybe it is toward the end...but after 20 minutes of slow instruction and explanation, I turned it off and walked away.

Had I rented first, never would have bought...",1406419200,,815,4.645833333333333

8232256,5,B000YDQJKI,Definitely a must have! Great poses and transitions that feel so good and natural. Dawn anticipates where your body wants to be I always feel empowered and healthier after Dawn brings me through a session. Love it!!!,1385164800,,216,4.864864864864865
8232257,5,B000YDQJKI,"This is an excellent DVD with detailed instruction on 5 different Sun Salutation variations. HOWEVER, i have found that there is an app called ""A Pose for That"" on Android and Windows Phone that includes almost all of the video included here and its only 2.99. It does NOT have the ""sitting"" variation and it is of course not full screen - but the mobile app includes detailed instruction and images on dozens of poses plus other extras not included on the DVD. So all in all, i think the mobile app is a better bargain - get both or either one - they are all worth it!

I don't know if these notes allow links - but the android app is at market dot android dot com and then just search for ""A Pose for That""",1313971200,2,708,4.1678832116788325
8232258,3,B000YDQJKI,"I am finally able to follow my yoga instructor's advice in doing some Sun Salutations each day.  I am not quite up to the number of repetitions that Dawn Holst recommends.

I like that there are 3 variations offered, however, it would have been nice if after a variation, I was brought back to the main menu where I could easily replay the variation for however many repetitions I am interested in doing during one session.",1310342400,6,423,4.552631578947368
8232259,5,B000YDQJKI,"I have to share a personal story that led me to Dawn's video. I am a middle-aged woman, and I started reading various articles on Yoga and what it could do for me physically as well as mentally.  Searching the net one day, I came upon Dawn's website, and we started to have a conversation about the study of Yoga.  Long story short, my friends and I are now taking a private class from Dawn. In her video, Dawn does a wonderful job of taking you through the steps of Sun Salutations in a quiet, powerful way.  The video is very easy to follow, and does a great job of explaining/illustrating each move.  It is a perfect compliment to classes or can be used regularly at home.  I am learning the practice of Yoga with the help of this DVD and Dawn's classes, and the experience is helping me become the ""fully functioning"" person I hope to always be.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to practice Yoga.",1209081600,16,910,4.323529411764706
8232260,5,B000YDQJKI,"This is a great Yoga DVD. I have tried a few Yoga DVDs to fill in the gaps between classes and Dawn's Qi-Yoga DVD is one of my favorites...This new one is a lot better. Dawn definitely stepped up the quality of video production in The Perfect Exercise, clearly this is not an LA production, but the shot composition is interesting and the use of cutaway alternative angles on poses helps you to see how the pose should look.

With full disclosure, I am lucky enough to regularly take classes with Dawn. A common vein between her classes and videos are excellent transitions. Beyond the attention Dawn puts into building a series of poses that enable your body to achieve both strength and flexibility....it is the transitions between the poses that I truly enjoy.

In The Perfect Exercise, Dawn blends in traditional Indian names of poses with their English equivalent effectively bridging the gap. This tape is very much like being in class with Dawn (minus the Hudson river!!!). There is no pretension here, the poses vary from basic to difficult and even include variations for those who need modifications of the poses. The urban setting brings a ""normal"" quality to the video that goes well with my own practice, which more often than not happens in the city (note you will not find me barefoot doing a sun salutation all that often but it works for Dawn).

Dawn does an excellent job of talking you thru the fine tuning that will enable the beginner to discover Yoga and the expert to focus on the details that will push your practice. If you only get one Yoga DVD this is a great one....If you are looking for 2, pick up Dawn's Qi-Yoga DVD also! You will get stronger, feel better and even fit into your clothes better from practicing with Dawn!",1197763200,12,1752,4.627009646302251
