7518633,5,B017S3Z1XM,"My kids absoultley love this collection of animal stories.

I bought this because of the Corduroy story. Cordury was my favorite book as a kid. As an adult, I saw the Corduroy live animation movie and wondered why I had never seen it before. For some reason, I don't think it airs anywhere on TV. Its nice that it was included on this DVD.

I will look for more of these Scholastic Storybook tales. We also own the one with The Very Hungry Caterpillar - they are great collections to have.",1475107200,3,489,4.362637362637362
