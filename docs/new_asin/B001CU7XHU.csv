He covered up his affair to the public and had his ""mistress"" tried as a witch. Mind you this was still in the times women were being accused of that and sent to the hangman's noose. In which case, the woman did just that, but before dying, she verbally cast a curse on the man responsible, Buck himself. Now, his grave has what appears to be a stain embedded in the granite of a leg or a hangman's noose. There are rumored versions of the tale in various forms.

** Mayor of Bangor Maine.

** Sara Ware, Murdered.
Some men or a party of them are accused of murdering a woman that attended a card game one evening. That is the rumor or how the story goes.
One or more of the men apparently made advances on her and when she denied them, one of them reportedly hit her over the head with a glass bottle or something similar. The blow killed her and they apparently panicked and buried her in such a way, that the area is now under a lake. Part of her body, notably her head, was missing from the body and severed. The head, used in the murder trial then, was placed as evidence in the Courthouse files. There it sat for about 8 decades or so, until a group of local women got together to put this case together for the sake of the deceased woman's body and burial. The incident happened in 1898. Local women have demanded that her body be reburied with her head for the sake of decency in this case.

One such man, decided to take his wife along with him on the job. Well, it proved to be just too much of isolation, just the two of them and no music or events to attend.
One day, the husband decided to buy a piano for his wife so that she would have some music or an activity to keep her occupied most of the time.
The Piano came and to the wonderment of the wife. She loved it, but it soon turned into an obsession with her. You see, it only came with one piece of sheet music. Something the husband didn't think of at the time. He should have got way more! lol
Over a short time, she mastered the song and continued to play it, over and over, and over again. Day after Day it played. Soon, the husband demanded she stop playing the song. She said she couldn't do it, she was obsessed with the tune. Soon after, the husband couldn't take it anymore and got a weapon, probably an axe. While she was playing the piano tune, he came up behind her and wacked her dead, Mid Song.
The silence was deafening to the husband after that, and he soon committed suicide. The woman is now known to haunt the island, in particular the lighthouse and grounds near the ocean. Rumors are also that the same tune she played over and over again can be heard from the ocean waters where she walked frequently to pass the time before the piano arrived.
