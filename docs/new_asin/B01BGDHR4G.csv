8750066,5,B01BGDHR4G,"- social metaphor, and not just for modern Russia.  As a tale of a morally fractured society and bankrupt politics it's applicable for any modern urban zone.  (Imagine these actors speaking lines in Bronx English if in doubt.)  The cracked building and its crumbling foundation is of course emblematic of its human environment.  Self-preservation becomes the prime key when faced with imminent tragedy; only ""The Fool"" reacts differently.  At the risk of a spoiler, when things don't fall properly into place and their savior is lynched by those to whom he brought salvation, we're left with the conclusion that somehow the world holds itself in place in spite of our best efforts to destroy it; that those who'd save us from our folly suffer the worst of life's betrayal.  A touch of ""reactionary"" anti-Christian Dostoevskianism - as well as cunning night cinematography - makes this visual ""House of the Dead"" a true Russian film classic.",1501977600,2,940,5.032258064516129
8750067,5,B01BGDHR4G,"Loved this film. The writing, the cinematography, the acting, the filming of the decay in a small russian town, infested with corruption at all levels.
I watched it twice, and i'm looking for similar films.",1479340800,,206,4.914285714285715
8750068,5,B01BGDHR4G,"Whereas in Bykov's film The Major, the story begins with a tragedy, in The Fool, the tragedy looms over the film, tensely and ominously, ready to strike at any moment.

Dima (Artyom Bystrov) is a young plumber in a provincial city. He has discovered that a run-down dormitory on the outskirts is about to collapse. He cannot be silent; he must do the right thing. And, after all, there are 800 people living in the dormitory.

So, over his familys objections, like the fool he is, Dima crashes the mayors birthday party to deliver the bad news. Yet, no surprise, it turns out the reason the building is collapsing, the reason it has not been fixed, is that all the city bosses have been stealing from the budget for years, greasing the next guys palms, sending kickbacks up the line. So nothing is left for the citys dormitories, much less for its roads, the orphanages, the hospitals or pensions. Or to resettle 800 people out of a collapsing building.

There is an exquisite tension at the heart of The Fool, because we know that building is going to fall  its a nine-story Chekhovian gun revealed in the first act that must eventually be fired. But, instead of taking action, the pit of vipers that surrounds the mayor only wants to cover their backsides. They toy with doing the right thing, but are caught in a trap of their own making: as in The Major, doing the right thing will expose their decades of thieving.

Yes, I take a little of every deal, the mayor says, But whose hands here are clean? An aide amplifies her sentiment: The whole country lives on bribes... If you don't take some for yourself, you live like a worm in s*** And another: I am a Russian, I cannot not take.

The film is filled with uncomfortable indictments of Russia political culture, and the fact that it won a Nika for best screenplay speaks to the fact that the accusations hit the mark.

To say more would reveal spoilers. But suffice it to say this is not a movie to watch if you want to come away with a warm and fuzzy feeling about Mother Russia or ones fellow man. Bykovs corrupt, dilapidated town is a depressing, dead-end place  a house of cards bound together by corruption and selfishness. If a fool tries to fix even a portion of it, he risks tearing asunder everything he knows and loves. But the caring has to start with someone. As Dima says near the films end, We live like animals and die like animals, because we are nothing to one another.
