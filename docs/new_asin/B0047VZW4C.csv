8742576,5,B0047VZW4C,"This DVD is an excellent look at Ithaca and the Finger Lakes Region. My Daughter was accepted to Cornell University
and the video gave us a preview into the city of Ithaca and the interesting places and beautiful scenery. The waterfalls, Cayuga lake, the gorges, and all of the festivals that go on through out the year. Ithaca has to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I am so pleased to have purchased the video and I highly recommend it.",1297814400,,455,4.428571428571429
