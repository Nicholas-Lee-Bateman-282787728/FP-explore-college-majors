8226269,3,B000X03E6E,"Kornel Mundruczo's Johanna is one of those films that you either love or hate without much middle ground to speak of. The film is a retelling of the Passion of Joan of Arc set in a hospital in modern Hungary.

Johanna (Orsi Toth), a young drug addict, falls into a deep coma after an accidental drug overdose following her participation in a disaster drill at a local hospital. Doctors miraculously manage to save her from death's doorstep. Touched by grace, Johanna cures patients by offering her body in acts described as total goodness. The head doctor(Zsolt Trill) becomes frustrated by her continued rejection of him and allies himself with the outraged hospital authorities who see her acts as that of a whore instead of a savior. They wage war against her but the grateful patients join forces to protect her. The story ends predictably for anyone familiar with the Joan of Arc story but what makes this production different is that it is filmed as an opera.

The music and lyrics are by Mundruczo and  Viktoria Petranyi and are for the most part quite interesting even if they do not always translate into English. The film is sort of a first for movie audiences as it is listed as the first opera made exclusively for the screen. A remarkable visual feast. A fabulous greenish/yellow color tinting shades the contours of the cast throughout the film, compounded by severe contrasts of moving bright flashlight pools in pitch darkness. A very strange ""out-of-body sensation"" grabs hold of you until suddenly the talking voices change into operatic ones. It may not always work but it is impossible to say that it is not an interesting ride for its short 82 minute length.

Unfortunately there has been no official Region 1 release of this film. The PAL Region 0 release is quite affordable and is easy to find for those interested in seeing this work of bold new cinema. The version I saw offered the film with English subtitles and the theatrical trailer. Worth seeking out if only for the sheer oddness of the whole experience.",1299974400,,2037,4.778409090909091
