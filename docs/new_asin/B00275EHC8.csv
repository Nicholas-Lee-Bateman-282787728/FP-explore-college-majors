3858948,4,B00275EHC8,"I've enjoyed Ricky Gervais ever since I first saw him in the UK version of The Office. His performance in his next series, Extras, was even better. Now comes The Invention of Lying, the first movie he (co)directed, and it is very entertaining!

Basically what we have here is a movie set in a world where lying never evolved. As a result, lots of things are different (like a Pepsi ad that says, ""Pepsi: for when you can't find Coke""). Enter Mark Bellison (Gervais). He's a short little fat man with a stubby nose (as everyone keeps reminding him), and basically a loser. He writes screenplays for Lecture Films, a company that makes movie featuring a man sitting in a chair talking about history. Fiction never evolved, you see.

Mark gets fired from his job and is at a real low point in his life. Stuck having to come up with $800 to pay his rent, he tells a teller in a bank that that's how much he has in his account. She believes him, why not, and gives him the $800 rather than the $300 actually there. Having discovered this new ability, for which he doesn't even have a work, Mark embarks on a series of life-changing events.

Now this could've just been a one-dimensional situation played for easy laughs, and there's a bit of that at first, but then he's at his mother's deathbed, in tears and she tells him she's afraid of dying, of experiencing nothing for eternity (for the record, I'm not. How can one ""experience"" nothing, after all?). Thinking quickly, Mark tells her all about how there's a big man in the sky who will give her a mansion to live in and a chance to be reunited with all her loved ones. She dies happy, and the hospital staff are amazed at this sudden revelation of an afterlife.

Mark has basically just invented religion.

Gervais is an outspoken atheist, and I think that's clear in this movie, where the theory is that religion can't exist without lying. It's a fascinating concept and one well-explored within the film.

There's parts of the movie that lag a little, and some concepts I would've liked to have seen explored a little more, but overall, this is a great film and one I recommend.",1254787200,11,2131,4.507772020725389
3858949,4,B00275EHC8,"I've liked Ricky Gervais ever since catching him in the original brit-com version of The Office (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-The-Complete-Collection-BBC-Edition-First-And-Second-Series-Plus-Special/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)</a>) and then later in the biting satire Extras (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extras-The-Complete-Series-Includes-Series-Finale/dp/B000YI99IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extras - The Complete Series (Includes Series Finale)</a>) (a series that was much too short, but then again, if you've seen the finale of it, perhaps not ;-) ).  Regardless, knowing that Ricky Gervais was going to star in The Invention of Lying made it a must see film in my book.

With theatrical release on 10/2/2009, I took my daughter and a couple of her friends to see the film The Invention of Lying over the weekend of its release.  I knew Ricky Gervais starred in the film, but hadn't realized that he also co-directed and co-wrote the film.

I'm sure that Zombieland probably mopped the floor with Invention of... in box office returns, and must admit that I was tempted to see if my daughter would rather see that instead, but we stuck with our (my mostly, I think) first choice and saw Invention of Lying.

To its credit, Invention of Lying is a PG-13 farce that looks at a world where everyone always tells the truth, with nearly brutal honesty. Rather than telling small lies that might lessen the pain that would be caused by being so honest, everyone always tells the truth, including commercial pitchmen advertising cola beverages (the ads for Coke and Pepsi that are in the film as product placement are very funny).

While the film isn't a laugh a minute comedy, it is funny and it inspires thought and discussion as the newly lying-capable character tells a lie that literally takes the world by storm.

If you aren't intending to see it in theatres, definitely add it to your wishlist and perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised by it when you do catch it.",1254700800,6,2166,5.666666666666667
3858950,5,B00275EHC8,Very original theme with great comedic acting and timing--especially from Ricky Gervais.  An underlying satire of religion gives this film extra oomph and makes it well worth your while.  Highly recommended.,1254614400,11,207,5.645161290322581
3858951,4,B00275EHC8,"""The Invention of Lying"" is the antithesis of last summer's ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" which is to say that it's an atheistic comedy instead of a faithful drama. Both are narrow-minded in that they fail to address a simple truth: The existence of God can be neither proven nor disproven. Still, the concept of ""The Invention of Lying"" is a very clever one, and I appreciated the fact that it goes for satire instead of saccharine. It's often times quite funny, although never so goofy that the occasional serious statement doesn't work its way through. It's above all a great vehicle for Ricky Gervais, who not only stars but is also the co-writer and co-director. He plays Mark Bellison, a screenwriter living in an alternate reality in which no one has ever told a lie; one day, he discovers to his astonishment that he's capable of saying something that isn't true.

Can you imagine a world free from lies? Books and movies as we know them would cease to be, and that's because fiction is untrue by definition. How, then, is Mark a screenwriter? Simple: In this world, movies are nothing more than a continuous shot of learned gentlemen sitting in a chair, reading out of history books. Such dullness is not limited to movies, though. Advertising is little more than confirming the existence of a given product, as seen during a Coca-Cola commercial (""It's basically just brown sugar-water,"" says a monotone man standing next to a plain-looking pedestal with a glass of Coke resting on it). No one uses flattery, and there's no such thing as sparing anyone's feelings; when Mark first meets his blind date, Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner), she greets him at the door by saying, ""I'm equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight."" Later on, during the date, she takes a call from her mother: ""He seems nice,"" she tells her. ""A bit fat. No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight.""

It goes beyond that. Nursing homes go by names such as A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People. Waiters will tell you that they took a sip of the cocktail you ordered, and they will also tell you if you're way out of someone else's league. Homeless people carry signs saying, ""I don't understand why I'm homeless and you're not."" Co-workers, such as Mark's secretary, Shelley (Tiny Fey), will say with a perfectly straight face, ""I realize more and more everyday how overqualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours.""

I think you get the idea. When Mark is fired, he finds himself with not enough money to pay his rent. He then goes to the bank to close his account and withdraw all $300. Only then does a sudden impulse surge through his brain--instead of $300, he asks for $800, the amount needed to pay rent. Since he lives in a world where everyone tells the truth, the fact that the system says he has only $300 must be a mechanical error. The clerk hands him his money in large bills, and he's on his way. Now that he knows he's capable of lying (although no one in this world uses that specific word since it's an unknown concept), he sets about writing a fictional screenplay, which he tells everyone is a long lost historical document.

Now, here's where it becomes a religious satire. During a genuinely touching scene, Mark tearfully tells his sick mother (Fionnula Flanagan) that death isn't an eternity of nothingness, that everyone goes to a place of love, happiness, and mansions where friends and family will be waiting. Astonished doctors pressure him into revealing more about what happens after you die, and soon, the entire world looks to him as a messenger. His ultimate explanation: A man living in the sky controls our destinies, is responsible for all the good and bad things that happen to us, and will reward us after we die if we never do evil things. Confused residents are bogged down by details such as what constitutes an evil thing and how many evil things we're allowed to do. It isn't long before Mark realizes how horribly out of control his lying has become.

Tied in with this is a sweet yet perplexing love story, one in which Anna finds herself torn between Mark and a snide screenwriter named Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe), who has openly hated Mark since day one. Initially, Anna refuses to have anything to do with Mark simply because he's unattractive. She finds herself drawn to Brad because, as she puts it, he's a good genetic match; their children will not be fat and have snub noses. Here's the perplexing part: In this alternate reality, no one is capable of looking beyond a person's physical appearance. Is it not just as truthful to like someone for who they are and not what they look like? Even in a world where no one lies, it's still possible to meet someone who will say, ""I want to be with you not because of your looks, but because you're kind, funny, and intelligent.""

Fortunately, satire and sheer audacity make up for the film's lack of plausible romantic situations. Gervais, with his biting humor and misanthropic persona, is well suited for this kind of material, and so is Garner, who adds such wonderful niceness to the story. Supporting performances from Jeffrey Tambor, Louis C.K., and Jonah Hill are decent, as are cameo appearances by Christopher Guest, Jason Bateman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephanie March, Edward Norton, and Stephen Merchant. It probably would have served the story better to take an agnostic approach--I feel that films adamant in confirming or denying the existence of God are too limited in scope (I exempt Carl Reiner's wonderful ""Oh, God!""). Regardless, I'm recommending ""The Invention of Lying"" for its humor, its dialogue, and its fearlessness.",1254528000,5,5651,4.755351681957187
3858952,3,B00275EHC8,"Imagine a world where people cannot lie:

An attractive young woman greets her date at the door and tells him this is the only evening they will spend together and she doubts he'll even get a kiss goodnight. She's out of his league and she doesn't want little pug-nosed fat kids.

The staff of an old folks home tells their patients they are the most likely to die.

Your co-workers feel free to say you're a loser, fat, etc.

Enter Mark Bellison (Gervais) a scriptwriter for the ""Lecture Film Series.""  His 13th Century Black Plague films were a rousing failure and he's slated for firing.  How does he know this?  His boss tells him, but he hates to hurt people so he's going to put it off....

Who knows exactly how Mark manages to lie the first time, but the second to ease the mind of his dying Mom, is a lot easier.  Unfortunately, that lie eases a lot of people's minds and they want details.....

There are portions of this film that are just brilliantly funny.  The first half had me roaring through.  The second, admittedly had its moments as well, but the pacing was both slower and less laughable. If I were rating by halves the first part of the film would be a 5 and the second a 2, thus the 3.5 stars. ""Invention of Lying"" definitely was an entertaining way to spend a quiet Saturday afternoon.

WARNING:  Christians who take strong offense at having fun poked at their faith may not appreciate some of the humor in this film.

3858953,3,B00275EHC8,"Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais, the brilliant creator of The Office) is a fat, financially unstable screen writer who is about to loose his job. He also happens to be in love with a beautiful, successful woman, who is much taller then he and has a pretty nose. And did I mention, they are all living in a Universe where everyone tells the truth, regardless of the consequences? It's not that they do not WANT to tell lies. It is that they are not capable of them. If fact, the word ""lie"" does not even exist in the vocabulary. And so, Mark's first date with his love Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) is likely to be the last one, as she politely informs him he is too fat, poor and ugly to be a viable match for her and she's out with him only as a favour to a mutual friend. Back in the office, Mark's secretary tells him she is far better qualified for his job then he is. Prompted with a ""how are you?"", his neighbour shares he has been trying to find the best way to commit suicide and he maybe able to ""close the deal"" that night... Etc., etc.

In fact, the entire first half of the film deals with setting up the ""lie free"" Universe. It also happens to be the better half. Smart and funny jokes come at you at a brisk pace while you smugly take credit for picking this film to see... However, as soon as the ""I TOLD you it was going to be good!"" rolls off your lips, something unexpected happens. Once Mark discovers how to lie and starts using the trick to help himself and others, his life picks up speed. But, the film slows down... It becomes unfunny and full of ethically and morally confusing messages. For example, while Mark encourages Anna to love him for who he is (which by now would be a liar, wouldn't it?), he himself spurns a woman simply based on her looks (which are on the same level as his). Each character's propensity for speaking their minds without any consideration for the feelings of others begins to grind us down. Everyone, including Mark and Anne, appears rude, heartless, and undeserving of our empathy and interest. This second half derails the film badly.

After a considerable struggle with the rating, I am calling it ""OK"". While the first half of the film held a lot of promise, it was unfortunately never realized. However, there are still enough laughs in The Invention of Lying to make it quite watchable and entertaining. Mark's choices will provide food for thought and a topic for discussion after the film is over. If you want to see a comedy this weekend and zombies are not your thing, give The Invention of Lying a try! Just keep your expectations in check.

PS: The Invention of Lying, in parts, makes light of Judeo-Christian beliefs. If this is likely to offend you, you should probably consider skipping the film.",1254441600,2,2766,4.462450592885376

3858989,5,B00275EHC8,"Such a funny premise for a story:  the idea that there is a world where people cannot (and do not) lie, until one man discovers how to do so and attempts to manipulate this knowledge to his advantage.  The truth telling process is often hilarious.  While the concept of the story can serve as social satire, which unflinchingly points out some of the sadder and more vacuous thinking in the world, and the harm such thoughts can cause, the message never gets heavy-handed.  Instead, the focus on the sheer absurdity of the situation only enhances the humor and poignancy of the story.  Ricky Gervais gives a spot-on, sensitive and funny performance as the character who invents lying.  The supporting cast's strong and sometimes bizarre performances (such as Edward Norton's portrayal of the police officer) help to enforce the ultimate fun and messages of the film.

Also you have to realize that there would be no creation without the ability to conceive of what is not.  A world full of people who only see what is obviously and on the surface true would never dream of a god, would never create any fiction and would be hard pressed to actually invent anything. The movie dances on the edge of this premise, it allows plot holes to exist almost as a way of exposing the invalidity of the stern science and observable fact based atheist.  Some facts must first be imagined, and then proved.  Scientist had to imagine DNA and then seek it out. Same is true with religion, man must imagine a reality beyond death... because it's comforting, because it solves the problem of death... And man has been seeking heaven and divinity every since.
This isn't an argument for or against God, but instead a argument for the need of a God... and the utter inability to find one in our world.

3859250,2,B00275EHC8,"I was instantly intrigued by the notion of a society in which humans could not lie. I became even more curious after seeing the line-up of cast members, and as a result, decided to rent the movie. However, I was sorely disappointed and only made it about half-way through before giving up on the video. There was a minor logic flaw in the truth-speaking society, where they lost all self-respect by always speaking. Yes, they could only tell the truth, but that doesn't mean blurting out personal (and sometimes gross) information without invitation. This seems more of a lack of self-control then actual truth speaking. But this minor flaw wasn't what caused me to stop watching the movie; rather, it was the religious mockery. I am fully aware that the religion paradies are only insulting to me because of my own convictions. As this is the case, obviously my dislike of the movie is subjective to personal opinions versus overall quality. For this reason, I assume to many audience members this movie would be heartily enjoyable due to its excellent cast/cameos and witty jokes. Therefore, my main complaint with this movie is that it wasn't more explicit in describing its real content: derailing of religion. I think because of the sensitivity of the subject ""religion"", the movie tries to subtly introduce the mockery so that you don't realize the main point of the film until you are a good way into it. For this reason, I give ""The Invention of Lying"", or by a more apt title, ""Lying and its God(s)"", two stars due to its cast members brilliance, but coupled with the misleading title. Slightly original perhaps, but truthfully, it is just another look at why religion relies on human gullibility to succeed.",1468195200,,1717,4.843537414965986

3859269,4,B00275EHC8,"What if we lived in a world in which the very concept of saying ""something that isn't"" was absent? Add to that a complete lack of filter between thought and speech, and you end up with a world of unintentional cruelty. Enter the everyman loser played by Ricky Gervais, who goes out on a date with a woman who is clearly out of his league. Not surprisingly the date doesn't go well, even though she warms to his sense of humor.

But then.... after losing everything (job, apartment, hope) something shifts in his brain and he discovers he can.... lie. Putting this super-power to use, he withdraws money from his bank and pays his rent. He sets out to see what other benefits he can derive, and tells an attractive woman he sees in the street that unless they go to a motel and have sex immediately the world will come to an end. Naturally she goes with him.

And it's here that Gervais plays his winning card: overcome by the unethical nature of what he was about to do, he tells the woman that the world isn't going to end after all so she doesn't have to have sex with him. The everyman-loser as nice guy then proceeds to get his job back by writing scripts that captivate all who hear them. For, in a world in which everything must be true, TV and movies are all essentially recitations of historical events. Some events are interesting enough but... what do you do with a century notable mainly for the Black Death? Turns out, once you've invented lying, the answer is ""a surprising amount."" Aliens and dinosaurs and all manner of other wonderful contributors turn the century into something everyone wants to hear more about.

And so everything is going well until... Gervais' mother is dying in a hospital bed. She's afraid. She knows that when she dies she will cease to exist and the realization terrifies her. In what is Gervais' most accomplished piece of acting in his entire career, he can't let his mother die in fear. So he begins to tell her a story about life-after-death. Which would be all right if his mother had taken the story with her to her grave but several of the hospital staff overhear, and...

Ultimately everyone in the world wants to know about this life-after-death where everyone has a mansion and is surrounded by family and friends. So the Gervais character holes up and ends up writing down Ten Rules on a couple of pizza boxes. But even these rules aren't as simple in practice as they seem in theory and there are some amusing moments when people realize that the Man In The Sky is responsible not only for the mansions after death but also for everything that happens: disasters, cancer, injuries. Soon the mob wants to find the MITS and kill him.

The movie could have branched off in any number of directions at this point but instead it resolves into a more-or-less standard RomCom in which, in the end, the hero gets the girl. It's pleasant enough and doubtless gained a much larger audience than it would have if it had continued to explore philosophical ideas, but some viewers will be left wondering how much more interesting it would have been if Gervais had given himself just a little more room on the ideas side.",1463270400,2,3161,4.558098591549296

Really interesting premise, could've been a great movie. I am a big fan of Ricky so I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The hospital dying scene was amazing and it could've taken off really well after that, something about the whole movie though just didn't make it into a great film.
As an atheist i thought the jokes were funny and the satire was good, however If I wanted to show this to other people like my family or something a couple of things that were obviously off putting was the scene where Ricky uses the pizza boxes, this is similar to the stone plates Moses used, also Ricky letting his hair grow and resembling Jesus- --some jokes were to Obvious.
some religious people are not very open minded and as soon as they realize that this movie is basically mocking Christianity they will no longer want to watch it.
if those jokes were a bit more hidden a bit more satirical, a bit more metaphorical then it may have done better at the box office.

The fun in this movie is actually before that happens with everyone just being brutally honest, as there is no such thing as a little white lie to protect someone's feelings.  Everyone has to tell it like it is and of course since this is the norm no one sees anything wrong with that.  There's a fair bit of storyline potential and more importantly comedy that isn't really covered with the ability to lie in a world where no one realises you are.  In the world this is set in for some reason because you can't lie you also want to marry someone who will give you the best genetic outcome children rather than marry someone you have fun with or who is a nice person.  The reason for this is never really explained and was just convenient for the romantic side of the storyline with Garner's character.

3859433,5,B00275EHC8,This was a very good movie about a world where people tell the truth all the time. It bothered me a bit with how honest everyone was though. There is a difference between being honest and being so honest you're being mean. A lot of characters are so honest they are mean and that was a little off-putting for me. I don't take any stars off for that though because the brutal honesty is what lead to so many of the laughs in the film.,1421020800,,433,4.105882352941176
3859434,5,B00275EHC8,"So first off, this movie was AMAZING! It had one of the best concepts I've ever heard of. Truly an amazing work of art.

But there is something else that needs to be said about living a world where no one can tell a lie.

One of the things I noticed in this movie, and maybe Ricky Gervais was trying to point it out, or not, is that because no one can lie, no one has an imagination. And because no one has an imagination, they actually look at the surface of things, and assume that all they see is all they get.

Take for example the scene where Gervais and Hathaway are sitting in the park, and Hathaway points to the fat man sleeping and says ""Oh he's just a loser."" And Gervais encourages her to not be so closed-minded, and to not ASSUME things about someone based solely on what you see.

That's the problem with living in a world you can't even make stuff up: people will just ASSUME things based on what they see. And because they'll just assume, they won't bother to find out. After all, the people in this universe BELIEVE that after you die, you go into ""a state of nothingness."" But how does ANYONE know that?

Ricky Gervais' character basically inspired the other people to look beyond and think deeper.",1420934400,,1217,4.3201754385964914

It does go into a bit of the God and religion issue which I didn't expect (when his characters mom is getting ready to pass away)  but the way they do it is ok. Not too much religious talk to where it's still entertaining and really funny. The premise of the movie is where nobody in the entire world is able to lie until one day the main character can. Can you imagine a blind date where you can't lie?? This was part of the movie and was super funny.

3859577,3,B00275EHC8,"I will start this review as I do most of my reviews; complaining about the 5 star system.  I much prefer 10 or even 100.  So I would say this is more of a 3.3 to 3.5.

-------------------------------------Warning!  Mild spoilers ahead, nothing major:----------------------------------
As you probably know the premise is that of an alternate world where people cannot lie, but what the synopsis doesn't tell you is apparently people also can't NOT say what is on their minds.  At first I thought, that meant the movie was going to be composed of people saying out loud things they didn't like about anyone they encountered for a cheap laugh and at the beginning there was a lot of that, which I feel gets old pretty fast. I wanted to say, ""You don't have to say everything that comes to your mind,"" to the screen, but then I realized that must be one of the unwritten ""rules"" of the movie.
---------------------------------------------------------End spoilers--------------------------------------------------------
After the introduction of the truth telling, the movie starts to get quite philosophical, which I liked.  If you think about the premise there are many things that could be explored with this interesting concept.  But the film fails to explore most of them and continues to garner favor with the cheap obvious gaffs.  It does however explore some of them, enough to keep the movie from being completely juvenile and in the end, I felt it was enjoyable, but not enough to boost it to 5 star territory.  I do recommend watching it.

There are some jabs at Christianity, so if  that bothers you, be warned.",1407628800,,1619,5.02621722846442

The movie is OK; I'll probably not watch it again.  One of the problems in the whole concept of the film is that it's not a simple lack of lying in the fantasy world of the film, but a compulsion to always speak what is on one's mind.  It's not telling the truth to think something, and not say it.  These people have a compulsion to always speak what's on their minds.  Sort of like a world of tourette syndrome.people.

3859805,4,B00275EHC8,"This is a witty, well-acted film based around a novel idea. Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais) lives in a world where the concept of lying is unknown - there isn't even a word to describe it. But Mark is in trouble. His screenplay for a movie about the Black Death is considered too downbeat and he's about to get sacked. He's also behind in his rent so he gets evicted. His date with Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) is less than successful. When he goes to the bank to draw out all his cash and close the account, their computer systems are down, so the teller has to ask Mark for his account balance. Then he has a brilliant idea: instead of giving the teller the correct sum of $300 he tells her the balance is $800 - which of course she believes. His mother is dying in hospital and is frightened so Mark then invents an uplifting image of the afterlife to put her mind at ease. When a nurse overhears this, a whole new religious cult is created. He writes down some principles he thinks would be beneficial to humankind on two sheets of paper, puts them in two empty pizza boxes, and addresses the multitude from his front porch. This is a thoroughly entertaining film, written and directed by Ricky Gervais with Matthew Robinson with humour that is subtle rather than hilariously funny, though I suspect some religious fundamentalists might consider it disrespectful.",1376265600,,1369,4.614754098360656

As a member of the LDS faith, we are often mocked by atheists and other Christian faiths all the time, so this was a weird one for me, you'd probably have to be member of my faith to fully understand why it's weird to me, but it is.  A movie like this is a peek inside the brain of the atheist mind and the ""better than you,"" bigotry they carry with themselves as so much more ""enlightened"" than the religious.  Overall it was pretty boring, I couldn't get the ""point"" that was trying to be communicated in what was deceptively advertised as a comedy (the trailer didn't have any of the religious bigotry).  If movie is art, then our interpretation comes from our own perceptions and life experiences, which I found no real relation to in this movie, it had a juvenile approach to faith, in addition to the plot being a total snore fest with no real creativity at all (if they wanted to insult religion they could have done better than that), very simple minded in religious understanding.

3859896,4,B00275EHC8,"If nothing else you will find yourself noticing that The Invention Of Lying is original. And that counts.  Especially nowadays.  Welcome to a skewed British comedy where the world as it is known is completely void of lying.  Everyone tells the bald, bitter truth.  There is no fiction.  No one even has a concept of the opposite of truth, at all.  Enter Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais), a schlepy, slightly-bloated lecture film screen-writer (who writes for the 1300's which seems to be the most boring period in human history). He goes out on a date one night with beautiful, wealthy Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner), where she proceeds to tell him how unattractive she finds him and that they will probably never date again (so painfully terrible it's excruciatingly funny).  Depressing.  He then goes to his job where everyone, including his demeaning secretary (Tina Fey) and his neurotic boss, is telling him he's about to be fired.  Then on to the hospital to visit his mother, whom everyone tells him is on the verge of dying, even though she seems perfectly fine.  What a life?  When Mark is finally fired he finds himself about to be evicted and has to go to his bank to remove the last of his funds in order  to move his belongings from his flat or they will be thrown away.  While confronted with homelessness he hurries to the bank where a mindless bank teller is asking how much he had in his account to withdraw because the system is down.  He has $300.  His rent is $800. Mark has an epiphany.  What if he didn't tell the truth? What if?  All great movies and novels and so forth start with that great question.  What if?  He tells the teller he had $800, and since lying doesn't exist, she forks the money over with a smile. What follows is Mark trying to get the woman he wants (Garner) sending his mother off to the after-world with a promise of mansions and love and awesomeness, and a whole lot more.

The Invention Of Lying is not hysterical by any means, it's actually rather heart-warming in places, but you will laugh and you will feel moved by it's thought-provoking tendencies. And its originality.  Definitely worth the watch. Fresh.  Charming.  Smart. British. All that you could hope for, right?  Ricky Gervais has done it again.

It amused me how much we lie to be nice, not hurt each others feelings and made me realize that lying is one of the nicer things we do, but at the same time lying can sap life of its vigor and sometimes can even thwart our progress as individuals and as a society.

Therefore, despite the fact that I really like this movie, I do believe these lines were completely unnecessary to producing a funny movie. There were many things that were insightful, and, as a whole, most of it was clean humor that portrays a different point of view on religion, how we interact and why, and how some people think so we need to be careful (some people will say or do anything if they will benefit). And, the greater good philosophy (stealing as a means to help someone - still wrong!), as well as later in the movie showing that the main character did grow up a bit and made some changes.

Being a huge fan of Ricky Gervais this was one movie I really looked forward to. The premise was promising, the idea was great, and since I pretty much laugh just by seeing Ricky Gervais I knew I just had to get it.

Well, the movie is fun. I wish they played it out a bit more, making it even funnier. I kept thinking to myself, ""What would I do if I discovered I could lie, as the only person in the world, and everyone would believe me?"". I'm pretty sure everyone who asks themselves that question would come up with answers that would be more bizarre and crazy than the ideas presented in this movie. I understand that they can't go too far, but knowing Ricky's previous works, I can't help but feel he held back on this one.

What I saw of it, and just from the title, I thought the premise was pretty stupid and I was not interested. But on Tuesday my friend Kate came to visit, and recommended I see this. She said it's a lot about religion, which had not come through at all in the trailer.

I enjoyed it quite a lot, actually. Any stupid premise can, it seems, support a pretty amusing movie if the lead actor has talent and imagination. In this case, Gervais not only played the lead, but was writer and director.

Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais) has wanted Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) for a long time. But they live in a world where lying is completely unknown, and even keeping your thoughts to yourself seems pretty uncommon as well. Anna agrees to go on a date with Mark, but frankly admits she considers him a loser, and short, fat, and with a funny nose.

Mark works for a film company that makes educational films. Of course there is no such thing as fiction, or even slanting the truth to make it more interesting. His department is history, and his century is the 14th. He finds it nearly impossible to write a movie script about the Black Plague that is not depressing in the extreme. He gets fired.

The landlord demands the rent, which is $800 when Mark only has about $300 in his account. But something clicks in his brain and he tells the cashier he wants to withdraw $800. To his surprise, the teller gives it to him. He has just discovered (or invented) lying.

There are some silly scenes where he tests his powers that basically make the point: in a world where everyone always tells the truth, a liar will be believed. If you say it, it must be true. He gets rich, of course.

I won't give away how religion comes into it, save to point out that until lying was invented, there was no religion. Of course the old adage is even more true: oh, what a tangled web Mark weaves when first he practices to deceive.

Does he get the girl? Come on, you know the answer to that.

I recognized several of the other actors, like Rob Lowe plays Brad Kessler, the handsome, wealthy and conceited competition for Anna's affection. Actually, it's not so much affection as her selection of the genetic makeup of the father of her children. One of my favorite funny men, John Hodgman, officiates at the wedding in a most unusual chapel, or ""quiet place to think about the Man in the Sky."" I'm told Tina Fey is also in it, but I didn't recognize her because she didn't look like Sarah Palin.

3860069,5,B00275EHC8,"A lot of times, when checking out a movie I really hadn't heard anything about, I am more than pleasantly surprised.  And so it goes for this one.  I am amazed this didn't do much box office, and to this day has had very mixed reviews from a wide variety of different sources.  I'm not sure what to make of this, except that it's the kind of fantasy film one either doesn't quite ""get,"" or the kind of premise which the viewer never really quite buys into from the beginning.  I am/was neither.  I loved it the first time I saw it, and after repeated viewings, love it even more.

There really is no way to even approach reviewing this movie without giving out at least a few spoilers, which I will try to keep to a minimum.  Seems there is this parallel universe of sorts, and a planet almost identical to our own, except for one major difference.  In the world of this film, there is no such thing as ""lying.""  Everyone tells the absolute truth about everything, from the most trivial matters, to ones sublime.  In fact, the very concept of not telling the truth, is an alien concept.  Seems it's just not hard-wired into people's brains and behavior.  All of this is just the way life is, until one day, our hero Mark Bellison (played by comedian Ricky Gervais, who also co-wrote and directed the film), a frustrated and soon to be fired and evicted screenwriter, has something snap deep inside his brain, and tells the first ""lie"" in history.  Things proceed rapidly from that point onward, and so begins a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs for Mark.

Mark becomes almost instantly famous and rich from his discovery of ""lying,"" but none of it really means much in the way of his personal happiness, because despite how he can effortlessly manipulate the world and people around him, his newfound success cannot save his sick, dying mother, nor win him the heart of an attractive co-worker Anna (played by Jennifer Garner) who he's had a crush on for years.  Anna in fact, ""cares"" a great deal for Mark, but sees love in a strictly practical way, and worries more about the physical beauty of any offspring she might have than about being true to her own deep feelings.  She even goes as far as planning to marry the handsome but superficial Brad (played by Rob Lowe), who shows no true regard for either her or Mark.

Getting too much further into what exactly transpires along the way, would be giving away too many details to those who haven't seen this yet.  What I can say, is that from the opening credits and first few scenes, I personally was hooked.  There are wonderful surprises throughout, both funny and sad, minor and profound, and the attention to details is incredible.  It is this last quality that gives the movie, for me at least, its greatness and re-watchability.  In other words, if you like this, it's a film you'll probably want to own.

The direction is good although happily unobtrusive, as over-directing this could've ruined the whole effect.  Various other celebrities appear, with special kudos for Jeffrey Tambor, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill and especially Louis C.K., but the down to earth performances of Gervais and Garner truly shine.  This is essentially a love story, but in a strange, strange world.  It is also a big positive that this is not drenched in hit pop songs every few minutes, as so many films seem smothered with these days, but what music there is, really works well.

For such a weird world where nobody except Mark lies, nor even understands the very concept, the film is marvelously consistent.  That is no small task, as in lesser and less capable hands, none of this would've really worked.  And while Mark's little (and bigger) lies create many memorable moments within the reality of this other world, there are some pretty deep comments here about our real society, and what unfortunately seems ""valued"" by most.  Finally, I must confess that I most enjoyed the moments when Mark's untruths eventually make him a prophet of sorts, and the sharp and unashamed jabs at ""religion"" in general and unquestioning belief systems in particular, make for a most enjoyable, and very, very unique movie experience.

I'm not that much of a Ricky Gervais fan, although I've always enjoyed his stand-up comedy routines.  I still do not quite know why this film did not win over more people at release and to this day gets some bad or mediocre reviews.  What I do know is that it's a truly unique movie and unbelievably well done, and that this in itself is a very rare thing these days, movie-wise.

I can see that some think it is slow -it is- and some wanted huge, I do not know, special effects or bodily gasses jokes or slacker humor.

This is a deceptively small, charming, simple movie.  For all of its simplicity it has big ideas. Ricky Gervais and Company give you room to think. You can choose to fill the spaces or to fill the quiet.  There are heavy questions about  seeing beyond the surfaces and questioning your beliefs or you can just stay in the story and forget these questions.

Meantime this is a quiet movie. A funny movie OK a wry smile, rather than belly laugh movie. A genuinely moving movie. It is never sloppy, soppy or over the top. It has faith in its story and tells it without distractions.

Ricky Gervais is spot on, inhabiting his character and totally believable. Jennifer Garner has that same wonderful smile that launched Julia Roberts' film career but her own innocence as a character living in a cynical world.

In classic British acting style - sorry it just does not feel like a Hollywood movie, even bit parts are portrayed like they have a full and complex back stories.

There's also some focuses on the afterlife and God which may turn off heavy religious types. Strange in the final cuts that the culture didn't believe in God yet had a Church with a cross on it in the background. This film was the directorial debut for Gervais.

3860095,3,B00275EHC8,"I really like Ricky Gervais and have for a long time.  And he is easily the best thing about this movie.  But I think the concept behind this story (a world where nobody lies, nor understands the concept of deceit -- until one day Ricky's character can and does) does not get explored or capitalized on like it should.  If fact, the concept misleads a bit.

In this movie's bucolic universe, no one lies and everyone believes everything they are told.  The misstep in the script is in how that is shown.  There is a difference between not being able to lie and feeling the need to share every thought, no matter how trivial.  Just because a person can ONLY tell the truth, it doesn't necessarily follow that everyone should speak their every thought out loud.  So we really have TWO premises at work here --  everyone says what's on their mind at all times, and everyone speaks frankly and without tact.  Withholding an opinion isn't the same thing as lying, and spouting one's every opinion isn't a requirement of not being able to lie, but this script does not make that distinction.

So we're left with a world where everyone is brutally honest but needlessly so.  It's funny at first, but it's a one-joke premise that grows old quickly.  It would probably be better as a short skit than a feature-length movie.

Gervais's script wastes little time mocking organized religion as a function of people blindly believing every ludicrous thing they are told.  But it plays more like an extended gag that interrupts the main story line, a man-pining-for-beautiful-but-unattainable-girl story.

Because the truth-spouting characters are also incapable of restraint and spew forth every thought they have, some of them -- in particular the lead female character and the object of Gervais' character's desire -- come off as really shallow and unlikeable people.  After a while it seems impossible that Gervais' sad-sack character could still be in love with the lead female after all the needlessly horrible things she says to him.  I can't understand what he loves about her.

But if he falls out of love with her, the story derails.  So it plays out to its inevitable but ultimately illogical conclusion.

Gervais proved with ""The Office"" (UK version) that he is a gifted writer, actor, and humorist.  But this story is half-baked and ultimately emptier than it could have been.

I think there could have been much more interesting material and concepts to be mined from a world where no one except ONE GUY knows how to lie.  Instead of swinging for the fences, Gervais seemed content hitting an infield single.  The story does stretch a bit to include some sweetness mixed in with the mocking of religion's followers.  But I believe that the writers didn't try very hard to have anything important to say or explore.

That's the truth.  No lie.",1319846400,4,2842,4.816115702479339
3860096,1,B00275EHC8,"The movie started slow, got a little better as it progressed, and then quickly devolved into what amounted to an atheistic slam against Christianity. The basic concept had so much potential for humor, but it appears very clear that comedy was not a significant concern or motivation. The earliest message was that a little deception could make sad people happier, and it made the main character rich in very short order. Once lying was used to comfort a character in fear of her impending death, the movie became a very evident mockery of Christianity and Biblical teachings. The main character (Gervais) was soon shown as a modern Moses, presenting the public with a list of 10 religious banalities on pizza boxes, which he had utilized in lieu of stone tablets (this was stated, not assumed).  This later escalated when Gervais appeared as an unkempt stereotyped image of Jesus with a bushy beard & long hair, wrapped in a sheet and wearing sandals. Towards the end, we are shown a church, which was presented as a quiet place to contemplate the man in the sky (Gervais's characterization of God), and above the altar was a stained glass representation of Gervais holding the pizza box tablets.

I'm not overly sensitive to humor at the expense of religion or religious icons, but I did not enjoy what came across as blatant crass propaganda. There was no deeper contemplation or examination of theological concepts, and I was really looking / hoping for something worthwhile that would have vindicated my purchase of this DVD. The sub-plot of romance was mildly humorous at the start when everyone was compulsively speaking what was on their mind, but that played itself out quickly and became a shallow, repetitive reference to Garner's concern that, due to genetics, any offspring would be fat with pug noses. That fear was what kept them apart.

The movie was mildly amusing at best, and the objective was very evidently not entertainment. I feel my time and money were wasted by sitting through this uninspired, insipid effort of selling the notion that God (the man in the sky) and Christianity (afterlife) is all a lie. The comedic potential was ignored in favor of hard-selling an atheistic, antagonistic opinion.",1319155200,7,2223,4.938502673796791

Then the ""parson"" in the church during the wedding scene is wearing a cross, which can only be a symbol of Christ. This is a completely extraneous introduction of Christianity into the plot. It makes no sense at all. In addition to that, this is a world where everyone speaks the truth, but there is no God or afterlife until Mark makes them up. Are we to assume or accept as a premise that there is no God or afterlife in a world where people can only speak the truth?

He has a point as it is difficult to plot a film, without some kind of 'epiphany' moment and, as this film demonstrates, good stories require imagination and, ultimately, lying.

This film dispenses with the need for a religious epiphany by making the epiphany instead into the discovery of lying and the ability to flatter others. There is also a sub plot where Gervais introduces the idea of eternal life and 'the man in the sky' to the truth loving people of planet Earth, who believe him because no-one has ever told a lie.

On top of this, this film has that rare quality of being an atheist comedy, being as it makes the idea of atheism being the truth into one of the key aspects of its humour.

Of course, there is much more to the film than just a narrow view-point on the world and it only struck me at the end of the film that it had this subtext.

3860135,5,B00275EHC8,"I thought there was some really brilliant, philosophical areas that Gervais explored with humor in this wonderful film.  Of course, the whole bit about being the first to think of telling a lie worked very well in setting up how religion was developed (and a god conceived of) in order to deal with the fear of death.  But there was also a real double-edged sword to this idea because the way it was portrayed really brought to my mind William Blake's conception of God, which was that God was the imagination.  Gervais' character was struggling within a souless, materialistic, extremely shallow and dertministic society, but then broke through to a whole new sense of awareness: the inspiration that he could make things up, that he could imagine,  he could be creative.  The act of creation, of projecting the imagination (giving birth to something out of nothing), was in William Blake's mind a god-like act.  As the character invented lying he was also opening up himself, and others, to the realm of the spirit which had been totally lacking in this bluntly materialistic world.  This also brought to mind M.C. Escher's sketch of the artist's hand drawing itself into existence - another powerful image of a process that could be considered devine (at least if you're William Blake).  I thought it was brilliant and hilarious how Gervais explored this idea to both tear down and expose the creation of religion from the perspective of a psychological defense mehanism, and, at the same time, reveal the underlying, transformational process that is at the source of human wonderment and renewal.  An athiest could watch this film and feel his opinions reinforced, but so could a believer in the devine - not so much a religious fundamentalist, but someone in touch with both ""Songs Of Innocence"" and ""Songs Of Experience"", like William Blake.  The power to create allowed Gervais' character to project into the world values that he felt were very much lacking, like compassion and love, and recognizing the internal truths, not just external beauty and wealth.  This ability to create allowed him to humanize others around him, at least those who were open to it, unlike Rob Lowe (he was perfect in that part).  Rickey Gervais is a very perceptive performer, and writer, which would explain his frustration and anger at the world around him - a great source of humor, by the way.",1307059200,3,2384,4.902985074626866

3860137,4,B00275EHC8,"I thought The Invention of Lying was funny and clever from beginning to end. The theme is that everyone in this  society tells the (extremely) blunt truth all the time, until Gervais finds a way to lie. Once he does, everything changes. Gervais eventually tries to cover his lies by saying a ""Man in The Sky"" spoke to him. A strong jab at religion? Sure. Extremely clever and funny? Yes.

Jennifer Garner is terrific as Gervais' love interest. Of course, at the end she sees through his mediocre looks and decides she wants to marry him anyway. A bit formulaic, but of course the protagonist has to get the girl, right? Watch The Invention of Lying--you won't regret it.",1304812800,2,670,4.621848739495798

How perplexing that this movie has a majority of 1 star votes and Step Brothers has a majority of 5 star votes. I don't know if there is anything else to say. To compare them is pointless.

It was funny to see how often we lie to mask our real feelings, flatter people to get what we want, and smooth out embarrassing situations.  The advertisements for Coke and Pepsi as well as political campaigns were funny satire..  The first part of the movie stays on message and is funny, but then the movie becomes too much of a tiring romantic tale between Mark (Ricky Gervais)  and the girl he loves played by Jennifer Garner. Over and over we have to listen to why she is too good for him, and her genes are better than his.  Yawn.  Another major turn in the story takes on religion and veers to atheism.  There is a very touching scene when Mark's mother is dying and worrying she will just drift off into ""nothingness"" and Mark promises her she will be young again, meet all her old friends and family and everyone will live in a mansion.  This is overheard by hospital staff,.  After his mother dies, the staff ask him how he knows that a wonderful place awaits everyone after they die?  Mark said the ""Man in the Sky"" told him and only he can hear his words.  His tall tales about God and re-writing history get out of control when the whole world hangs on to his every word.

At times, this movie is funny, but mostly not.  It was sometimes touching, but it did not stay true to its theme.  It meanders all over topics of dishonesty, atheism, genetics, rebirth, and the ironies of life.",1303430400,3,1561,4.428070175438597
3860141,2,B00275EHC8,"In a world where nobody can lie, and nobody has ever been able to lie, one man (writer/director/producer Ricky Gervaise) figures out how.

Given that premise, the movie was not what I expected at all.  My initial complaint was that everybody seemed to have Tourette's Syndrome rather than just truthfulness.  Characters blurt out their masturbation habits, private insecurites, and nasty thoughts without even being asked.  It wasn't funny or clever, or consistent with what I thought to be the premise.

However, I soon realized that ""Lying"" in this film is defined so broadly that eliminating it amounts to a profound change in human nature.  In this world, there is no such thing as fictional stories, and no dramatization of true stories.  Everything is strictly literal, with no metaphor.  Religion, which involves the use of inadequate words to describe the ineffable, is not possible.  There is no compassion (because that's ""pretending to care"" I guess).  There is no romance, single folks look around for good providers with good genetic material.  Poetry is mentioned, but it must be bad.

""No lying"" also means no privacy for oneself or consideration for others, with people blurting out every embarrassing or hurtful thing that crosses their minds.  To quote G.K. Chesterton, there is ""no cloak of courtesy, no stages of intimacy, no free will in friendship"".  Except that what was for Chesterton an ""unfathomable insult"" against human dignity is simply the way everybody treats everybody else all the time without remorse or compunction.  And here you thought ""no lying"" would be good . . . or at least funny.

While an interesting notion, this blighted portrayal of human nature eliminates the prime source of comedy -- human embarassment -- while making all the characters flat and unlikable.  Also, this world is poorly developed: For example, despite lacking religion, their history seems to have followed the same course as ours.  Where Monty Python might have used this as fuel for comic absurdity (like giving ""truthful"" reasons for the Crusades or the Pilgrims or the refusal of William Penn to take off his hat) Gervaise just lets it lie there like a dead fish.  The ""blockbuster movie clip"" we see shows a boring lecture on Napoleon, instead of having some fun with poor Napoleon's attempts to run a perfectly transparent dictatorship.  Could Hitler have come to power by being completely honest?  I'd like to see him try.  Not in this film.

So instead of exploiting its actual PREMISE, most of the film is devoted to yet another Whiny Male Saga of a Dumpy Guy pining for the Hot Babe Who Must Learn To See His True Worth -- written by yet another jerk too shallow to realize the hypocrisy of this whole premise.  Yawn!  The hero's growing friendship with a suicidal fellow-loser is the only emotional positive, and that doesn't amount to much.  The death of his mother (which prompts him to invent religion to comfort her) is too real and sad a scene for the rest of the film.  With a little taste and good judgment, the same point could and should have been made via an annoying urchin burying her pet hamster.

Speaking of taste and good judgment:  As you may have gathered, ""Lying"" is defined so broadly in this film that calling religion a ""Lie"" doesn't make it false in any meaningful sense.  But there is a deeper problem here.  To me, irreverent humor depends upon a sense of reverence, just as bawdy humor depends upon a sense of propriety.  The nudist scene in A SHOT IN THE DARK is only funny because Inspector Clousseau possesses a sense of modesty to be mortified, and because we relate to this.  The old gag where a sap bad-mouths someone who turns out to be standing behind him is only funny if the sap would never do such a thing on purpose.  Frank Drebin's disastrous encounter with the Queen of England in NAKED GUN is only funny in context of the attitude that Her Majesty really ought to be treated with respect.  So in order to work, irreverent humor needs to play off a sense of reverence, like King Arthur's in HOLY GRAIL.  (""We're averting our eyes, o Lord!"")  Otherwise it would just be pointless and mean-spirited.

And mean-spirited is just how this film comes across much of the time.  Rick's impromptu impersonations of Jesus and Moses are not funny, are not trying to be funny, and make no point.  They are lifeless non-jokes which result not from irreverence, but from the soulless modern sensibility which allows for no ""cloak of courtesy"" to be draped around the Sacred in the first place.  In ye olden days, those who made jokes at the expense of religion felt obliged to actually be funny, which was itself a form of respect.  It is the lack of any such effort here which is offensive.

In fact, the filmmaker is treating his audience with the same bland contempt that the clueless cretins in his film show towards eachother.  He had a good idea in his head, and simply blurted it out on screen without care or forethought.  The result as lacking in romance, tenderness, imagination, delicacy and humor as his characters.  I agree that it provides food for thought. But to actually make a good film, you need to think BEFORE you roll the cameras.",1302912000,2,5205,4.778275475923852
3860142,4,B00275EHC8,"I'm new to the comedy of Ricky Gervais having seen him only in small roles like Night in the Museum. He is amazingly sharp witted  and talented with a style that reminds me of Ben Stiller, though he looks nothing like him. The Invention of Lying is clever, original, and irreverent. I loved hearing what we think spoken aloud, and how even before he discovered lying Gervais was the one person able to not say whatever popped into his mind and just react to the tactless and inappropriate comments being flung at him. Hilarious. I also thought his poking fun at Jewish/Christian beliefs and traditions was often insightful and really funny. What he picked as the basis for the first religion and the spread of religion was silly but rather fascinating too. I was on the edge of my seat along with the masses to hear the next ""commandment"" as well, ha ha.

 SPOILER The one thing that didn't work for me was at the very end what came across to me as atheist agenda pushing.  If it were say a movie about pretending to see aliens or claiming to talk to dead people, you'd say ""I don't really see dead people/aliens"" and not ""there are no aliens."" Also, at his mother's grave Gervais says ""I know you are in really in there (the ground)"" it would be better if he said ""I wish you really were in a mansion in the sky,"" that is, take a more agnostic in tone re: ""the man in the sky."" END SPOILER

All in all though this is a thought provoking movie not primarily about lying, but about truth. And how, to discover truth, we need to go beyond the raw facts to seek deeper meaning beneath the superficial surface level, explore fiction, and yes, even have a little faith.",1302566400,2,1664,4.407166123778501

3860194,3,B00275EHC8,"Much has been said about the premise and plot of the film, so I won't go into that. My problem with the film is this: The central idea of the film is that the concept of lying - saying something other than the truth - has not yet been invented (at least, not until Ricky Gervais does so). However, much of the movie's humor revolves not around lying, but on simply saying whatever happens to be going through the characters' minds, without any editor.

To me, it does not follow that not being able to lie is equivalent to saying whatever you're thinking. Nor does it equate to being completely insensitive about the feelings of other people, which is what most of the characters in this movie are. I suppose you could make the philosophical argument that withholding the truth is the same as lying, but I think that it is possible to tell the truth without telling the whole truth.",1299456000,,882,4.478260869565218

By the way, I don't believe that Ricky set out to attack or make fun of religious people with this movie. I'm sure he just firmly believes that the idea of a God is pure fiction... and this belief inspired him to make a very funny movie about that subject.

Keep up the good work, Ricky!",1299456000,3,519,4.56989247311828
3860196,5,B00275EHC8,"The Invention of Lying is a beautifully poignant, smart and funny movie. It raises many questions about how we treat each other, and about what motivations truly lie behind our decisions.

By setting the story in a world where lies of any kind do not exist, we can begin to see just how pervasive lying is in our real lives. People in this alternate world are cruel to each other. This is not because they are trying to be hurtful, but because they are incapable of omitting the truth when answering questions or making someone feel better with a half-truth or ""white lie.""

In this entirely honest world, we see what really drives people. The beautiful woman may enjoy spending time with the clever, funny man, but she would rather marry a man whose genetics will give her beautiful children. A homeless man carries a sign that says, ""I don't understand why I'm homeless and you're not,"" and the nursing home is ""A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People.""

The absence of any form of lie also means that there is no such thing as fictional stories in books or movies. For entertainment, people watch filmed lecture series that factually recount historical events. Likewise, advertisements cannot sell their products with false promises of the happiness they will bring.

People in this completely honest world have also never heard of god or religion of any kind. This is entirely fitting, given the context of this alternate world. After all, various religions have their own competing stories of ""the truth,"" yet each are a matter of faith--not fact.

Those who are uncomfortable exploring the idea of religion as a man-made invention will probably not like this film. There are certain sight-gags that Christians may find blasphemous (e.g. 10 rules delivered on the backs of tablet-like pizza boxes).

However, those with an open mind will see that both lying and the Man in the Sky mythology that emerges are depicted as having both good and bad points. Lies make the world more complicated, but the brutally honest world at the beginning of the film has many flaws of its own.",1297987200,3,2077,4.803921568627451

This movie is like Gulliver's Travels, the novel.  It is guffaw funny on one level, but right beneath the glib surface, there are gnawing questions and critiques of how most humans socialize, hide their true feelings, conceal their real disappointments and even their joys.

It is satire at its best.

3860199,2,B00275EHC8,"Overall not as well written or as funny as I had hoped for.
The story follows one man (played by the uber funny Ricky Gervais), through the drugery of his Looser life, and exposes his world.  You see, he lives in town, where everyone tells the truth all the time, no matter what.  Well, somehow, he starts telling lies, at first for his own good (to get money) and then to help people (feel better about their lives, etc.)  The lies soon catch up with him, after he's befriended a girl he's had a crush on for years, and ends up falling in love with her, and she's forced to make a decision that would ultimately change the direction of her life.  Good messages in the movie, about being kind, helping people, etc.
However, the movie fell short on the writing.  It really needed a stronger script, better plot, better character development, better world building, and funnier comedy.  I've seen some of Ricky's stand up comedy shows, and the man is very funny with his odd whacked out sense of British humor.  Though I have never understood the U.S. show ""The Office"", just didn't think it was funny.  I haven't seen the British version (the one Ricky created) so I can't compare the two, or speak to his writing ability on that show.
Obviously the cast include some pretty amazing names, who have done incredible work.  And if the cast are talented but if I don't like the characters, that leads me back to point my finger at poor or incomplete writing and development.  I felt it was a waste of some fantastic talent.
Too bad.  I won't be buying this one for my library.",1296086400,2,1572,4.480701754385965

While the premise that everyone doesn't have the ability to tell a lie is actually a really good one, the unrealistic nature of people blurting out information upon randomly interacting with a stranger is what caused this movie to fail. While this is prevelant in the first quarter of the movie, it eventually does get toned down as the movie continues. The best moments are those that are less in your face; an old peoples' home called ""A Place for Sad Old People"" is quite funny and the sheer audacity of the film to invent religion is one for the record books and something I was considering in my head before it was introduced in the film. Overall worth watching but not worth buying.",1294185600,,799,4.517241379310345

I was outraged at the content, the message and the mockery that is made of people who believe. The fact that Ricky Gervais is an atheist makes it more than clear that he is trying to promote atheism by making a mockery of the concept of believing in God. People of all faiths, any faith should steer clear of this film and do our small part to let Ricky Gervais know that his approach is not acceptable and his message is not mainstream.  People are free to believe or not believe as they wish, but let's do so peacefully and respectfully.  So many of us agree to that in theory, but apparently not in practice.

3860245,3,B00275EHC8,"One thing that I would surely rescue from this movie is the fact that language is a powerful weapon, but it has to be revitalized, as in poetry and literature.  We communicate with eroded phrases: ""How's family?"", ""Have a nice day!"" etc. In Mxico, a beggar kid (a kid from the streets) used to be called a ""nio de la calle""; now the government slang has labeled him as a ""nio en condicin de calle"", which more or less translates as: ""boy in street status""; a really old person (a nonagenarian) falls in the category of ""adultos en plenitud"": adults reaching fulfillment... but in complete poverty most of the time.

If it weren't for the good old lies, we would be forced to live in the top of a rock for the rest of our lives.

3860246,5,B00275EHC8,"I thought this would be a just a cute and silly time passer, but I was really surprised by the clever and original concept of this film (I have never seen this premise before. It's quite different than ""Liar, Liar""). I was entertained, yes, but the comedy was only a part of that and not the best part. This film is a thought experiment that plays with our understanding of truth and falsehood and the functions it serves in society.  The screenplay is ripe with implications and inferences!  My favorite aspect was the way it pokes fun at the concept of authority and how easily people surrender their own authority (rationality) to others.
  There are some negative reviews here regarding the mockery of Christian theology in this film and I am surprised (well, not really), because I have read the bible (the whole thing, more than once) and the only reference that I saw was the scene with the pizza boxes and the reference is not specifically Christian.  All of the other religious references are vague and almost universal.
  This film is a thought generator, with some good satirical comedy to make it go down easier.  But, I am biased because I enjoy having my understandings challenged. I welcome any and all critical thought or insight. That is how we grow in wisdom.  If your worldview is dependent, entirely upon conformity and a blind acceptance that cannot endure any challenges, then stay far away from this film.",1291420800,5,1428,4.748987854251012

I was insulted by the overall storyline that a belief in God, and of the afterlife, was the invention of lying.  This movie is a STEAMING PILE of horse manure put out by a production company with an obvious political agenda.  (Oh, Shame on you Mrs. Garner for accepting this type of role.)  I was NOT impressed.

The invention of lying is a joke here and there, and the price of the all-too-rare humor is tedious sermonizing about the evils of religion, but the only preacher here is Ricky Gervais.",1290124800,,522,4.7555555555555555
3860251,3,B00275EHC8,"As mentioned in the many other reviews this movie takes place in a world where people may look like we do but instead, in it live people who are incapable of lying. The concept of lying is unknown to anybody there as is the case of hyperbole, satire and acting. It seems everyone in this world is not morally, but simply physically unable to lie. Things such as murder, rape and racism are known but the word lying doesn't even exist so when Ricky Gervais' character dicovers he has this ability. He uses it as he sees fit. Bascially no matter what he says people believe him simply they cannot fathom someone telling something untrue no matter however absurd that may seem to someone of this world.
Now this movie will understandibly upset a lot of people because also in this world there is no religion and/or any belief of an afterlife. So when he says to his dying mother that when she dies she will go to to another place and live happily and eternally and other people hear him say this. he becomes an unwitting sort of a prophet. Let's just say that some of the things he says and some things depicted in the movie may have more than passing ressemblance to current religions in this world and some may find that insulting.
Also it seems that everyone in this world seems to have a...ummm prediliction to marrying they find a genetic good match. The protagonist being chubby a bit short and have a ""stub nose"" is always referred to as a loser. I guess someone like Bill Gates in that world would also be a loser beacuse he is not handsome and i guess, may be below average looking.
Overall i found the movie okay. I wasn't at all offended. I just didn't find the movie all that funny. As Newton Ooi, below me said watch this movie for its originality not for entertainment. Of course what one finds entertaing is highly subjective. newton gave this movie two stars.

There are so many things wrong with it that I could write 5000 words, but there's no need. It is a snide and trite film, where, as in Liar, Liar (which was, amazingly, better than this!) people say every stupid thing that comes to their mind. The supposed jokes, as when the hostess says to the gorgeous woman, ""I feel threatened by you"" are irritating. First, saying every dumb thing that you think is not being truthful, it is being rude. It is easy to be thruthful without insulting people. (I guess Hollywood can't imagine that concept.) But a civilization where fiction was unknown would not operate in our moral plane. It would be hugely different. So, use your brain oh creative genius! Establish that place! Don't just show me our world with that difference. A powerful lack of imagination and insight made this film far, far, far less than what it might have been.

I have seen better writing by high-schoolers. Awful, boring, stupid, insulting, condescending, tedious, predictable, derivative, uninspired, unimaginative...how many other words do we need?

C) it was funny. Not the best funny I've ever seen, but anything that touches the religious third rail and gets out alive is a miracle. Yes, the irony is intended. D) I added the fourth star just for the hell of it to counter the numerous one star reviews that hacked at the film from all extremes: far right and far left and far snobby and far dumb.

Apparently when a filmmaker hasn't made the film you already had in your head, that's a bad thing. Fair enough. I've had my share of films like that. But this film was by no stretch of the imagination a one star film. Love it or hate it, it took a great idea and made a mainstream film. That's all. It had good acting and while the story was weak at points, it was strong at points as well.

 For anyone reading this thinking that it is an ""attack"" on religion: Pshaw. If it's an attack on anything, it's an attack on not thinking for yourself. When Bradshaw asks Gervais, ""What does the man in the sky want me to do?"" Gervais doesn't answer her and walks away. Now, he could have said: ""The man in the sky may give you a mansion when you die, and love eternal, but while you're living he would appreciate it if you would let him off the hook for every damn little thing that happens to you, he'd appreciate it, if, from time to time you could make up your own damn mind.""

 As for the ""not smart enough"" crowd, I repeat--mainstream movie. For everyone. Pandering? Perhaps. But, cynically enough, movies are made to make money as well as art. Until the time of the great enlightenment, that's a fact. Kudos to those who got this made and who made it work most of the time.

The story is simple enough; mankind has not learned how to lie, and we witness the very first man acquire and use this ""talent.""  Set in modern-day America, most likely a small town in the New England countryside, this story shows what society might be like if everyone told the truth, and nothing but the truth, without pause or censorship.  Now first of, if I were a thinking man, I would straight away ask if American society would have developed towns, cars, dress styles, businesses and other features if no lie was ever told?  I doubt it, so the entire setting of the movie is somewhat ""artificial"" to start of with.  But if we pass on this and look at the plot itself, we find another problem.  Everybody speaks the first thing that comes to their mind.  In fact, everyone goes out of their way to speak the first thing in their mind, or is supposed to.  If this were literally true, the movie's dialogue would progress like a stream-of-consciousness novel.  But what the movie actually shows is a rude world wherever everyone looks down and talks down to everyone else.  So a more appropriate title would be ""The Invention of Pause, Politeness, Second Thoughts, and Lying"".  Even taking this into account, the movie is quite boring in places as the movie is essentially exploring a society different from ours.

But after the point where Mark tells a lie, the movie just disintegrates. * SPOILER ALERT* He tells a lie to further his own personal interests, understandably, but I thought that Bad Karma would get him for it. Well, he goes through some difficulties, but in the end he wins. So I guess the moral of this stupid story is that it's OK to lie, even if you do it for personal gain.

The only part of the plot that is good is that Mark wins over Anna because he truly loves her, unlike how hotshot Brad Kessler feels about her. That's fine and dandy, but that has nothing to do with lying. So basically, the whole premise of everybody always telling the truth and never lying is useless..there is no connection between that and the love triangle of those three, other than the fact that Mark is rich from telling a lie. But Kessler is probably fairly wealthy, too, so dumping Kessler for Mark doesn't seem to have much to do with money.

I know, it's just a comedy (so-called) movie, nothing to get too serious about, but I thought the storyline was weak and disconnected.",1280707200,,1178,4.423963133640553

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?

In a world where nobody lies, and therefore everybody believes everything said, is a world ripe for exploitation if you could lie.  Well, Ricky Gervais is the only one with the ability to lie in this world, and he does get some good results - becomes wealthy, famous, and respected (earning Time's Person of the Year). However, because he's not willing to completely lie to the woman he loves, he doesn't have success with winning her heart because ""he's not the right genetic material to father her offspring"".

Unfortunately, the movie veers into a bizarre attempt to insult religious belief in general, with the Gervais character making up ""The Man in the Sky"" and eternal life to comfort his dying mother.  Soon, the whole world wants to know about this Man in the Sky, and he ""invents the lie of religion"". This angle of the movie is a mean-spirited attempt to disparage religion and spirituality, and is simply not amusing in the least.  I, for one, was offended, as anybody should be, whether you have faith, are agnostic, or even atheistic.  The movie became a weird propaganda device to show how dumb religion is - not something I would have expected from a comedy.  Very disappointing film.",1278720000,13,1373,4.743697478991597

It's too bad too, this movie has the good basic formula to be very funny. I get it the people in this movie speak the truth all the time no matter how awkward and outragious it is. But as you watch it you realize you can only recycle that gag so many times before it gets boring. This would have been better as a short subject on Saturday Night Live. I think the dirrector saw this too and decided to take a sharp left turn use this film as a chance to show massive amounts of disrepect to the Christian religion.

Great movie, definitely worth watching, and sure to provoke some lengthy conversation after. Unfortunately, as shown by some of these reviews... it requires a bit of intelligence on the part of the viewer.

It's not just an anti-religion movie, it's entertainment, and suggests something very funny - what if we could not lie, and had no faculty to determine if somebody else was lying? Would we have free will? Could we have science? Would we buy Pepsi cola if the best advertisement they could make was that it's the soda you drink when you can't buy a coke?

It has some dangly ends, and doesn't really answer the question about how their world ended up the way it is - with people capable of scientific inquiry, yet unable to tell a truth from a fiction - but you'll laugh so hard it won't matter.

3860368,4,B00275EHC8,"I was originally dissuaded from renting this movie because of low ratings, even though I've always thought he was funny, the previews looked pretty funny, and the premise of the movie seemed pretty clever. But I was willing to watch it, when my wife rented it instead. As it started, my concerns started to pan out. It wasn't just that nobody lied in this ""world""... They were also terribly gullible, and they tended to not just tell the truth, but rather they told the most NASTY truth they could about a person. So, it was more than a little bizarre, and took a while longer to get used to it because we weren't expecting it to be that out there. A slow start.

Then it got more and more clever, and it started to make you think a bit. The movie really showed its brilliance for me when it took its religious twist. In this world, there has never been a belief in God or any gods. The main character creates it, and becomes like a combination Moses/Jesus for everyone for a good long time, as he convinces them there is a Heaven and that it pays to be nicer. It shows the audience how utterly silly the stories and premises of Christian religion are, while still showing that there are good principles and morals to take from its teachings. I think more people should see this movie and ask themselves if what we've grown up believing actually makes sense.

My wife believes in the Christian God, and I am an Agnostic, so I found it humorous, while she was a bit quiet, absorbing. She agreed that the movie was quite good, but she didn't really break it down like we normally do, and I didn't want to pick a fight, by saying ""makes sense, doesn't it?"", but it kind of explained a lot of my own reasoning in a very clever way, and for that I will recommend this movie quite readily, in addition to the fact that it was plenty amusing to begin with!",1275696000,3,1849,4.341040462427745

To be honest, I actually had to force myself to get through all of it. Yes there are some funny bits and good dialogue but it goes off the rail from the story about 20 minutes in and it feels like Gervais is just trying to throw us ideas instead of letting the story develop. The worst part about this movie is the editing, I mean most movies have one and maybe two montages this movie is just montage after montage with crappy pop music as the actors fake smiles and gags are thrown left and right as if to tell us ""look we are so charming and funny"" No you really are not, your just a joke at this point. I really wanted to love this movie, but with such a bad finish product that left me feeling like I was watching an incomplete work, I just couldn't.

We could have been taken on a very deep roller coaster ride exploring the ramifications of his decision. (And by darkness, I don't solely mean depression.  It could have been handled in a comedic fashion too).  Or the movie could do what it did; become one of the umpteen million typical hollywood movies that gets bogged down in resolving the age old guy meets gal baloney.

Even if he spends the rest of his career in sappy comedies like this one -- and I have a feeling he might -- I'll always like the guy, even if I won't spend time with his films.

You know from the start the story here is weak because Gervais has to tell you the background plot in voiceover -- here is a place where the idea of telling a lie doesn't exist. The story concept is just too much of a stretch -- when Mark (Gervais) tells an obvious lie, you'd think people could at least wonder if he is somehow mistaken. And the ""shock"" of hearing people speak candidly about intimate habits or hostility toward others just doesn't result in laughs -- it's pretty old nowadays.

And yet, there's some intelligence to the film. If the laughs were here, I'd give a lot of credit to the clever, unhurried build-up to the main plot. And the way it suddenly becomes a fairly radical critique of religion nearly half way in. I have to admit it got me thinking for a few days after watching -- not about philosophy, which is actually pretty simplistic in the movie -- but about filmmaking, and what makes a ""good"" or ""poor"" film.

""The invention of lying"" is a seriously flawed imitation of ""Liar Liar"".

3860396,1,B00275EHC8,"Ricky Gervais is a very talented comedian, but there has been a huge disparity between the quality of his TV work and the movies he's been involved in. 'The Office' was a brilliantly observed character comedy, one of the greatest ever made. Hollywood, however, seems to see Gervais as a 'funny, fat British guy', so he's been relegated to silly bit parts or broad caricatures. In 'Invention of Lying' he had a chance to write and direct his own film, so there was potential for something great. Unfortunately it completely fails to live up to that promise.

The premise of the story is that it takes place in a world where human beings do not have the capacity to tell lies. There are a few laughs at the beginning where we see the flat and boring world where creativity is non-existent (eg. the entertainment industry consists of someone sitting on a stool in front of a camera and describing historical events). Ricky Gervais' character, Mark Bellison, is a mediocre loser who one day discovers the ability to lie, and in an instant a world of possibilities opens up to him.

You could do a lot with this idea, since deception of others and of ourselves constitutes a huge part of our lives. You'd expect that someone who could create a character like David Brent (whose entire tragic persona consisted of deceiving himself about his own abilities and other people's opinion of him) would open up rich veins of satire on this subject. However, what we get is just sketches of ideas that aren't fleshed out in any interesting way. There are limitless possibilities in charting the logic of this alternate world, but Gervais takes it nowhere. For instance, there is a romantic sub-plot involving Jennifer Garner's character, and how she may learn to overcome her truthful analysis of Mark as an evolutionary dud and see that his friendship is worth her love. Out of this you could create a myriad of twists and layers of irony about the nature of relationships, but this arc of the story just sits there until one day she realises that she can be with him despite his defects. The slightest bit of thought could have made it more interesting. For instance, she is not even consistent in her single motivation, because surely Mark's evolutionary fitness would be increased when he becomes the most influential and admired man in the world. The romantic ending is just sentimental and not at all satisfying, since there is no reason to want Mark to be with such a superficial woman.

The main part of the story is about Mark inventing a religion in order to comfort his dying mother, which then takes on a life of its own. A lot of people have been offended by this, but the real offense is in how lazily this idea is handled. To essentially just state baldly that 'religion is lies' is not satire, it is an ideological position. For it to be funny we would need to see more of how this might develop, perhaps giving Mark a dose of self-deception so that he is uncertain whether he is speaking the truth or not. I mean, just because people are incapable of lying doesn't mean that what they say is necessarily true, since they may just be mistaken. There should be room in this movie perhaps for people to develop alternate 'true' religions, for example, since the tensions of competing truth claims are a part of our own society. But Ricky didn't make the effort for some reason. Anyway, good religious satire is usually focussed on a specific group that has identifiable values and tropes, not just religion in general. For instance, a film like 'Dogma' hilariously skewered modern Catholicism in a way that spoke to the genuine weaknesses in that group while still conveying a sympathy for those who are part of it. 'The Invention of Lying' doesn't show that level of sophistication.

I've given this movie one star because of the drastic gap between its potential and its realisation, because it was boring and unfunny, because it was a complete waste of Ricky Gervais' talent, because it represents a capitulation to the lowest common denominator of Hollywood comedic sensibility by someone who made one of the greatest television shows of all time.",1273363200,13,4152,4.730662983425415

Gervais is his usual comedic genius and his dry humor will keep you laughing the whole way through. But do not be deceived, this film is not just a run of comedic gags, there is something much deeper within the film.
The preview is somewhat deceiving, the film takes a drastic turn halfway through when Gervais' lying turns to what ends up creating religion. specifically Christianity as we know it. This may rub many Christians the wrong way, but I would encourage them to continue watching. The film makes some interesting points about atheism and religion that should get one thinking. Ultimately it is a romantic comedy and love wins out at the end of the day. This brings out questions about love if there is no God and the conflict I believe many atheists must wrestle with, why do humans experience and value emotions and love even though it goes against ""survival of the fittest"" doctrines.",1273276800,,992,4.674285714285714

There are some subtle scenes in the film which it sounds like some of the 1 star reviewers missed.

It doesnt just promote lying as a bad thing, as shortly after he finds this out he lies to several people which helps them see their lives in a better way - the homless guy on the street, the people in the care home. Reminded me a bit of Groudhog day when he tries to save the homless guy over and over again.

The scene round the pool when the 2 guys say they have given up looking for something better in this life as they are waiting for the next one, I thought was probably too subtle for most. Here he is saying if you think the after life is so good, what are you waiting for ! Something most religions seem to promote but do the followers really believe this - He alsmost goes as far as saying 'put your money where your mouth is' but its left up to the viewer to come to this conclusion.

Yes, Im don't believe in religion (and I'm English), think about this...

I never do that, and I don't really like comedies, not because I don't like to laugh, but I don't think most of them are funny. I love Blazing Saddles or maybe a Chris Rock stand up routine. But apart from that, don't waste my time. But here I am watching this movie and after a couple minutes I'm thinking ""wait a minute, what's going on here?"" It's funny but it's more than that.

If you believe in the big man in the sky and will defend your belief to your last breath, you probably won't like this. And more power to you, if that's your thing. But if you're skeptical or don't have strong beliefs and maybe have questions about life and communication, I think you will like this. Yes its about lying, but not only to others but also to ourselves. and its not only okay but sometimes even helpful. or maybe not. By the way, the first sentence of this review is a lie.

I really don't think I laughed once.  I liked the premise, but it didn't work for me.  People not only couldn't lie, they were compelled to share every thought and explain their motives for everything.  While I was wallowing in my disappointed boredom, I was suddenly hit with a surprise ""anti-God"" agenda which became a major part of the movie.  I found it to be offensive.",1270252800,12,519,4.537634408602151
3860440,4,B00275EHC8,"if your belief in religion does not allow for any questioning or reflection, you will not like this movie. You can check the other reviews and see why - religion is ""invented"" according to this movie.
""The Invention of Lying"" takes place in an alternative world, where lying was never used - not even ""No, that dress doesn't make your butt look big"" or ""oh, yes, cute baby"". It's a painful world to live in, where every thought spills out of your mouth without any censoring. So if your assistant is looking for another job on work time, she'll tell you in no uncertain terms.
But Mark discovers lying - he can lie to his bank and withdraw more money than what he has, cheat at casinos and gain lots of money. But he is the only one who knows how to lie. Everybody else takes what Mark says as gospel.
Having achieved some measure of success, Mark manages to get a second date with the girl of his dreams. She still isn't attracted to him, doesn't want to have ""snub nosed fat kids"". The second date seems okay, but it is interrupted by Mark's mother's death. This (to me) is one of the most moving parts of the movie. His mother is terrified of dying, terrified of an eternity of ""nothingness"". To calm his mom, to allow her to have a peaceful death, Mark tells his mom of a wonderful place where you go after you die, where you see all the people you've loved that have died. You get a mansion. You're young, healthy, you can do what you want.
Suddenly, Mark is extremely popular - everyone wants to hear what he has to say. He writes down his 10 things about religion and puts them on the back of a pizza box and reads them to the waiting crowd. Mark has managed to create an afterlife, a heaven, something for people to believe in and hope for.
Of course, this causes a lot of problems. And Mark's DNA is still the same  even though he has become successful. And he can't lie to the Jennifer Garner character - the only one he can't lie to. And she's going to make a huge mistake, marrying Mark's work rival because he is a better genetic match for her.
The movie resolves itself a little ""cute"" for me, but I did enjoy it. If you're able to take some questioning of religion, you will be rewarded by this gem of a movie.
I recommend it highly for those who enjoy Ricky Gervais' comedy.",1270252800,3,2290,4.288683602771362
3860441,2,B00275EHC8,"If this movie raised any questions with me, it's the following: what did I just watch? Who gave this the ok on getting made? Why did Louis CK and Jennifer Garner waste their time by being in it? Trailers would lead you to believe that this is another slapstick comedy, but it's not. Normally, I'd be fine with that since I know trailers can get the tone of a movie all wrong (just look at the one for Wristcutters), and I wouldn't be upset if the movie tried something different. The Invention of Lying also appears to have split reviews into two sides- people who think the movie's anti-religion, and people who praise the movie for 'raising questions' as so many have put it. Me? I don't see the movie as being anything special at all, because it's full of the kind of things I hear on a regular basis whenever I take public transportation.

The movie takes place in a world, very similar to ours as far as the appearance goes (buildings, jobs, etc.) but everyone tells the truth. If someone thinks another person is fat, they flat out say it and don't try to put things nicely. The main character, Mark, is trying to have luck dating, but things aren't going well at all because he's overweight. He just got fired from his job too, and doesn't have money to cover this month's rent. Basically, life sucks for him. But when he goes to the bank to get money, something in his brain snaps and he lies. He says that the computer made a mistake, and there's more money in his account than it says there is. The teller goes with it, since he must be telling the truth like everyone else, and from there, Mark's life gets a little better. Anyone believes anything he says because that's how the world is- what you say is what it is. But things make a huge turn when his mother is ill in a hospital, and he tells her about a place where everything's better when you die (basically heaven without calling it that), and that there's no sadness or anything bad. The doctors and other people overhear this, and want to know more. Through his little fib, Mark basically becomes a prophet of sorts, 'knowing' everything and speaks with God (again, without calling it that).

Yes, I can see how this movie might be seen as anti-religious, since the message would be 'hey look, this guy made all this up, and people believed it'. Is it so bad that we should throw a fit over it and give it one star reviews because of it? No. It's because the movie is just bad. When Mark's mom dies (it happens very early on in the movie), the mood changes completely and you're wondering what happened because it's so abrupt. Until that point, the humor (and I'm using that term loosely) was standard British, dry delivery, and it got old fast. In the first 10 minutes, I was ready for the movie to be over. Once Mark lets people know about an afterlife and the rules to get into the good place, the movie changes into a more standard comedy, but trys to be one that makes you think. And the jokes aren't even funny either- they're the kind of things that hardcore athiests, the kind who flip out whenever they hear the word 'god' anywhere, would force themselves to laugh at just for attention. I'm not a Christian but these jokes were annoying more than anything. Having Mark write the rules of life on pizza boxes, as a nod to the ten commandments, and reading them to a huge crowd of people didn't do anything for me, and I'm the kind of guy who loves religious jokes by George Carlin, Lewis Black and Bill Hicks. Those ones make sense, and are funny. Here? Nothing. Everything's too in-your-face that it gets old fast, and it makes you wish that it had just been a standard dumb comedy. The plot also becomes a love story where Mark tries to win over Anna, played by Jennifer Garner, but she doesn't want him to be with her because she wants to have beautiful, successful children, and makes note constantly that he's fat.

What's even worse is that Jennifer Garner and Louis CK were involved. Garner is a respectable actress, and it's like she only appeared in this movie to cover a payment on a new car. She tries her best with the material she's given, but because of the story- everyone believing what people say, you never like her character much because like all the others, she's rude and dumb. And Louis CK, oh lordy Louis CK...one of the funniest men most people haven't heard of. Do NOT use this movie as a decision on if you think he's funny or not, because his character was completely useless and didn't get a single joke. Check out his stand up or video skits if you want to see him really shine. There are other good actors like Jonah Hill, Tina Fey and Martin Starr, but their roles are brief.

The picture and audio quality on the dvd were average. 'nothing special, and I didn't get to see any of the special features because once the movie was over, I immediately returned it. I didn't want this thing giving my dvd player E-STDs or anything.

Again, this review comes from someone who's neither Christian or Athiest, or any religion for that matter. I'm not offended by what got most people riled up. There's just about nothing I liked about this movie: it's boring, way too long and not funny. But getting to look at Tina Fey was enough to bump up the score. If you go into this expecting anything smart, lower your expectations. Because you can probably get more out of searching through LiveJournal entries about religion from teenagers on anti-depressants. If written by anyone else, this movie could've had promise, but as it is, I'll just lie if people ask if I've seen it or not.",1270080000,2,5583,4.458904109589041
3860442,5,B00275EHC8,"Wow. I was totally blown away. The last thing I actually expect Hollywood to do nowadays is make a movie that is thought provoking, tackles some truly profound issues about the human condition, and is funny to boot.

Ricky Gervais has won instant respect for me. I bet a friend before coming to Amazon (I rented the Blu-ray on Netflix) that there would be a bunch of 1 star reviews. And that none of them would actually be about the film per se or its quality but would be religious peoplem who, get offended when someone asks them to think about what they say they believe and why.

Gervais ends up examining 2 aspects of the human condition, lying and religion. What would a world be like where people simply not only did not but could not lie. You get a number of humorous situations from this. It makes you think about the role of 'social lying' in particular. Manners, in a way, for lack of a better word

Now on to religion. I think Gervais hit on 2 issues that are very germaine. One how can an 'all good God' be responsible for the good and the bad. Very hard for anyone to explain although people try with that oldie 'everything happens for a reason'. Also explores an honest reaction to a 'god' well tourting people for eternity.

Of more interest to me though was the potential consequences of becoming focused on an afterlife at the expense of this life. The character played by Jonah Hill represents an all too real condition. People who place less value on their life, this life, because everything will work out in the afterlife or that is the real life. This can create HUGE HARM to individuals, society, and the planet. If people don't treasure every day as it should be, if they don't treasure the earth as their home, if they don't treasure each and every species as their brothers and sisters, they risk missing out on exisistence, they miss out on the universe, they miss out on Life. And they do not, perhaps, treat the Earth, themselves, and each other with the depth and meaning they should. If the Earth to them is a shadow, how can it mean what it should?

This is of course IMO. I am sure many people will disagree. But kudos, HUGE kudos, to Ricky for getting this on film. One of the most meaningful and thought provoking, yet also comedic, films Hollywood has done in years.",1269907200,83,2303,4.460807600950119

What you have is ""The Invention of lying."" It is often believed that good stories are reworked from old stories we've come to enjoy.  Subliminally, this story is ripped from the story of Genesis in the Bible.  A peaceful place upset by a character with selfish intentions.  To a great extent, the movie is satirical, but also makes effective commentary about traditional religion without being sermonic.
In addition, witness how manipulation takes over when society is steeped in ethics and conservatism without regard to diversity of thought.

3860455,1,B00275EHC8,"I couldn't have been more predisposed to like this movie. I'm a Ricky Gervais fan and not remotely religious. If it's never occurred to you that a supreme being might be created to help people deal with fear and that a person can be moral without believing in a supreme being, then you may like this film. Otherwise, it's an exercise in how not to make a movie. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it. It's message was about as subtle as a root canal. (Owing to anesthetic, my root canal was actually a little funnier.) The direction and lighting were amateurish. At first, I thought that many of the actors could have phoned in their lines and saved a trip to the studio, but I decided that was inaccurate. The problem is that the movie's world in which everyone is truthful is a world in which everyone is earnestly monotone. Apparently, it's usually too difficult to be emotional and honest at the same time. The only glimmer of hope is that this is intended to be ironic: see what happens when everyone lies to you.

3860456,3,B00275EHC8,"Writers come up with a gimmick for a movie. They start patting themselves on the back when they dream up all the great situations their characters can get into. The trailer is practically ready to go, the pitch is great, lots of big stars are in! Building a world and playing in that world is the fun of the movie, but sooner or later you have to resolve it according to the rules laid out and it makes for some awkward endings....hence this movie.

""The Invention of Lying"" was written and directed by Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson. Gervais also stars as Mark Bellison, a chubby fellow with a good heart and some bad luck who happens in a moment of desperation to have figured out how to lie.....in a world that NEVER has.

This movie has a very strong beginning as we explore a world where people have to tell the truth about how they feel every second, but where they can't even have lies of omission by keeping their mouth shut. These people feel the need to be absolutely honest about everything that floats into their brains creating hilarious dialogues between characters and it is a LOT of fun. Eventually an event happens and the ability to lie seemingly turns on in Mark's brain and then we get to play with THAT situation as he tries to explain what he has discovered to friends and they don't understand what he is talking about, they don't even have worlds like ""true"" and ""false."" Then we watch him use the situation to his advantage and it's still very funny!

Eventually, there's a switch and the movie changes. I could instantly see why some people might complain or be offended by this movie after the change. The writer/director combo touched on a big idea with enormous potential for comedy. After it was introduced, it become more difficult for the movie to be funny as they neared the climax and they had to come up with a way to end it. The writer/director combo couldn't play in their world anymore and it just kind of sulked off to a conclusion that would probably please the greatest number of people.

That being said, it IS worth a watch, NOT for the easily offended, keep it away from your grandmother, Jennifer Garner is cute, the cameos by big name stars are AWESOME, Tina Fey is the BEST and I wish you luck because I will tell you no more! It's a shame such a funny movie had to lose steam in that fashion and just kind of slip away....so much potential!",1269129600,,2392,4.466819221967963

He starts out by telling lies to get a financial edge but soon it evolves into more benevolent lies, embellishments designed to improve others' self esteem.  Eventually he creates a deity and an afterlife on the back of a pizza box.  I really don't know where Gervais, who co-wrote the script, is going with this.  There's a scene later in the film where he awakens with long hair and beard, bathrobe, and sandals.  Is he supposed to be some kind of (anti)Christ figure?  Some are offended by this film but I was too confused to muster much outrage.  This flick is too slight to get yourself in a lather.

3860459,4,B00275EHC8,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is as funny as it is thought-provoking. I've always thought of The Truman Show as one such film. The Invention of Lying is another. I wasn't sure what to expect given that most modern comedies are worthless garbage, but I was very pleasantly surprised.

The Invention of Lying features an alternate reality in which humans are incapable of lying or distorting the truth. Everybody simply states whatever is on their mind, no matter how rude or disrespectful. That is, until Ricky Gervais tells one lie and realizes the awesome power of lying.

In the movie, the lack of lying doesn't just mean people aren't deceitful. The Invention of Lying takes this concept into more interesting directions, such as showing a lack of originality in movies without an ability to stretch the truth (all films are simply narrations of historical events). Another odd development is the introduction of empathy and kindness with as Gervais learns how to tell ""white lies"" and solve people's problems.

Of course, the biggest (and most controversial) change is the invention of religion. As Gervais' character begins to lie, he also tells half-truths to comfort people. When his mother is near death, he invents a wonderful image of heaven to allow her to pass in peace. As word gets out, he soon begins preaching about ""the man in the sky"" in an attempt to convince people to choose right over wrong. However, the plan backfires as people start neglecting reality and simply pine for heaven.

At some moments, The Invention of Lying goes too far (Jennifer Garner's first line was ""I was masturbating""). I don't think the humor trashes religion too much. In fact, it doesn't ""trash"" religion at all and never really makes inappropriate comments about religion. As long as you're open-minded, I think it'll be possible to watch the movie and laugh.

The larger problem for me is that the movie seems schizophrenic at times and loses sight of the theme (a world without lying). The first half of the movie features Ricky Gervais and his conversion to compulsive lying. However, as his relationship with Jennifer Garner's character gets more serious, there's a lot more discussion about class and genetics (being honest, she rejects his romantic advances because he's short and has a stubby nose). In fact, a few times I thought I was watching a rerun of Gattaca. While I think it's definitely time for another sci-fi movie about society and genetics, The Invention of Lying isn't that movie. The directors should have stuck closer to the original premise. Or better yet, they could have created a different Ricky Gervais comedy with a plot revolving around genetics.

Overall, it should have been two movies, not one. That said, it's still a solid 4.5 stars.",1268784000,,2786,4.917021276595745
3860460,5,B00275EHC8,"I have just watched this film and I loved it, however I can see how it really polarises opinion; you really love it or hate it. If you are a theist then you will most likely hate it, it is very difficult to like something if you totally disagree with the message. If you are atheist then you will most likely love it and you should read the bad reviews too as they are funny. For me the bad reviews are positive because of the sort of people who have written them, they get upset because the film contradicts their views on religion, and they betray themselves with their ranting.  I have seen many films with a religious message and enjoyed them so why can't they laugh a little when some one pokes fun at them?

Many critical reviews indicate that the film starts well but runs out of steam. Would that be about the time when the main joke of the film kicks in and it's on you?

Don't be put off by the negative reviews. A very funny clever, thought provoking, deceptively satirical film. It takes a somewhat over used fantasy idea and builds the comedy over and above what anyone else has done. Then half way through slaps a large section of the unsuspecting audience in the face with a large wet fish.

3860461,1,B00275EHC8,"The gist of this movie is that the greatest lie ever told to man is the existence of God. The fictional movie also exists in a world where everyone always tells the truth, no matter how bold or harsh. No one, in this movie, even knows what a lie is-hence the name of the movie. The Gervais' character discovers the idea of lying in another scene, and he realizes that it makes life much easier for him in some ways. In another scene, his mother is dying, and she is fearful and desperate. She believes that she will face an eternity of nothingness following her death. In a desperate attempt to soothe her, Gervais' character invents a place of mansions and happiness (heaven). The doctor and nurses overhear this, and they are intrigued. Word gets out that Gervais' character has received information of an after-life. He is pursued for this information, and he invents a man in the sky (God). The people are irrationally soothed by Gervais' character's ideas. There are no counterpoints to Gervais' character's claims in the movie, and there is no counterpoint of enlightenment. The character merely claims at the end that he invented the whole thing.

I feel it's my duty to inform you that this is not a chick flick, and it's average. It is not as good as Gervais' other movie Ghost Town, and it's not as good as his shows Extras or The Office. The aspect about the `lie of God's existence' is not listed on the back jacket of the movie, and it's not in any of the promos I saw. It caught me off guard. Now that you know, feel free to rent, buy, or download if this is your thing.

As to the counterpoint, it would've been nice to see some commentary about the other side. Example: While some believe in the existence of a man in the sky, others believe the sky is falling (i.e. Global Warming). While some believe that a bum on the streets is always a victim of circumstance, others believe they are there as a result of some form of self-indulgence. While some believe in the mythical assistance men in the leadership roles of government can provide to humanity, others believe that the key to success and happiness in life is through self-sufficiency.

It may have been difficult to fit such counterpoints into the plot, but Gervais could've done it. He could've seen Americans indulging themselves in a love of the principles of Capitalism, and he could've invented a lie such as, ""there's a man in Washington who lost in a run for president, and he decided he needed a legacy, so he latched onto an idea that stated that our indulgence is causing a catastrophe of epic proportions."" He could've then had certain people of the world irrationally worship that man, give him a Nobel Peace Prize, and Gervais could've had this man avoid any dissent and debate with some wild declaration along the lines of ""all the science is in. This catastrophe is happening."" He could've had irrational exuberance occurring on both sides, but I'm sure he didn't want to offend anyone.",1268697600,10,2975,4.6200378071833645

I'm just not sure what to say? The premise is a perfect set up for a great, original film. A society where no one has ever lied, everyone is taken at their word and when someone is told something it's taken as hard fact. One man discovers that he can lie, and it is like he has developed some kind of super power as he spins out several lies, one more fantastic than the next. Sounds good right? What a perfect set-up, and who better than Ricky Gervais to pull it off?

""Invention of Lying"" looks great on paper, but in execution, it's simply a snooze-fest. Gervais does a decent job, but the material he's given is just awful. Within 2 minutes of the opening credits we get a series of un-funny jokes about masturbation???? And the writers must have thought they were really witty as that single joke is played out over and over again for like 16 hours. Ugh. We get tons of cameo appearances by a slew of celebrities like Tina Fey, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton and Jason Bateman, but they don't really bring anything to the film except a mild sense of ""what the hell are they doing in this?"", I guess Gervais had some friends that owed him?? Anyway nothing really pans out with the cameo appearances, it's just another gimmick that falls flat.

I think the biggest issue I had with the film, is that it's premise seems light and fun, and about 1/3 of the way through the film ""Invention of Lying"" gets bogged down with this religious angle that drains away almost any fun, then to top it off the underlying lesson of the film is don't judge something or someone on appearance alone.

3860482,3,B00275EHC8,"On one hand, this little film exceeded all my expectations: I expected a stupid, insipid one-joke comedy that would be forgotten in a week. This is what the trailers led me to believe.
Well, the trailer lies. I've never seen such a complete disparity between what the trailer led me to expect and what I actually got. This is one of the most thoughtful comedies I have seen in a long time.
It is also one of the most disappointing.
But wait, didn't I say it just exceeded all of my expectations? I did indeed. But it is disappointing because it is easy to see how much better this film could have been. Buried under an almost childish need to shock the audience (and, thus, a lack of self-restraint), a lack of understanding of the film's central gimmick, and a lack of nerve to explore this film's more radical implications is the skeleton of what could have become a comedy masterpiece.
Unfortunately, it is not.
If you've seen the trailer, you know basically what the film's big gimmick is: the people in this hypothetical world are unable to lie. There's no concept of truth or falsehood, because nobody has ever needed to make the distinction. These people can't conceive of any other kind of reality. This has some implications which lead to a number of the film's funniest jokes (while I do not want to ruin these for people, I will use one as an illustration: commercials, since they cannot lie to the audience and manipulate them psychologically as real commercials do, are nothing more than a spokesman for the company in question begging the consumer to please buy their product, even though (in the case of the spokesman for Coca-Cola) it will make your kiddies fat. The film is filled with this kind of witty ribbing.) It would have been easy to fill the film with increasingly crass and outlandish jokes resulting from the condition of this world. The film avoids this, however, and maintains a level of self-respect I would never have expected of it.
This gimmick is only a springboard, however, for a deeper subject: religion and humanity's need for some level of self-deception.
This is really the heart of the film, and it is totally unexpected. It touches on a whole host of philosophical issues (is lying ever bad, or are there times when it is more ethical to lie than to maintain the solemn truth? what is the nature of the connection between religious belief and morality? Do humans at core require some level of self-deception to be happy? And just what is the nature of happiness, anyway? Even if religion is untrue, isn't it still preferable for a dying old woman who is terrified by the thought of eternal nothingness to believe in an afterlife and be comforted and profoundly relieved in her last few minutes of life? And what is the nature of love and sexual attraction: is it more prudent to follow your emotions or to provide your children with superior genetic material? And what do we mean by 'superior' genetic material-- superior in what sense? etc. etc.) I could go on. The film is brimming with all sorts of questions. Unfortunately, it never goes past merely hinting at these questions, and it never explores the implications of its atheistic message. It seems as though, having gone so far as to say that God doesn't exist, it is afraid of pushing any further and alienating its audience any more than it already has. Was this due to a legitimate lack of nerve on the part of the creative minds behind this film, or was there pressure to tone down the atheist stuff by the film's financial backers? I don't know, but this is about as honest as a big-budget studio film can possibly get. It could have been more honest, though, and consequently more insightful. This should have been an independent film. And the creative minds behind this should have more fully explored the implications raised by it.
I mentioned a lack of self-restraint: it is obvious that the intended scenes are supposed to shock the audience with the jarring way people just spout whatever is on their mind. But they don't always do this, especially when it would be inconvenient for the plot. And the inability to lie does not mean that people would have no self-restraint. The film goes overboard to shock us, but it grants later on that these people CAN restrain themselves. So have they also not evolved the ability to feel shame? Where does it end? How different are these people? I really wish, instead of trying to shock the audience South Park style it would have just laid out the rules coherently and stuck to them. It would have helped the film tremendously.
The film winds down with one of the most formulaic endings I've ever seen to a romantic subplot. It is sub-blockbuster. If they couldn't pull off a love story that was believable at all, they should have left that element out of the movie.

The film is really a mixed-bag. It's an intelligent high-concept romantic comedy with a witty satirical edge and some uproariously honest and brilliant scenes, but which suffers from a formulaic romantic subplot, a lack of nerve, and a childish compulsion to shock the audience, even at the cost of the film's internal coherency. I would still recommend seeing this, though: it is still a hundred times better than the vast majority of comedies out there (with a few notable exceptions, such as Pleasantville or Groundhog Day, two films which had the nerve to probe below the surface and found water). See it, and try not to get too offended. It isn't out to insult you.",1267920000,2,5492,4.6853002070393375

It's a two hour rant about how telling the truth is a bad thing, lying is a wonderful thing, and believing in God in absurd.

3860504,1,B00275EHC8,"Actor and co-director Ricky Gervais presents his athiest worldview in this transparent, unfunny look at just how problematic truth can become.

A detailed review of the storyline would only serve to belabor the fatuous thinking behind this humanist exercise.  Suffice to say that the main character is only fully realized once he begins to tell non-truths; this evolution consists of indulging in as much self-gratification and indulgence as Gervais' 'hero' can muster... but surprisingly (?) he still feels a void within him.

In a rare altruistic moment, the main character comforts his dying mother with the assurance that (a) there is life after death, and (b) there IS a Supreme Being.  This sets the stage for a general misunderstanding of all things spiritual... (it is, after all, just another lie)... and allows Gervais and company to rail against this version of a Creator for all of their individual shortcomings and hardships.  (The line: ""F*** the Man in the Sky!"" is actually shouted by a disgruntled seeker).

An attempt at satire, this film's one saving grace is that it illustrates how subjective life can be without a moral compass.  Oddly, it finds a world based upon truth as one that is harsh, tedious, based on selfishness, and berift of compassion.  It is only when deception is 'invented' that humanity is allowed the satisfaction of meeting their innermost wants and desires.

In this case, Gervais has accurately (but unintentionally) provided insight as to the flaws in that kind of thinking.  Each individual is shallow and unlikeable, wholly predictable, and completely self-consumed.  Even when lies are used to better a situation, the victory is pyrrhic; there is no lasting contentment because immediate gratification is fleeting and unsustainable - without more lies and more dedication to self.  (Anyone even remotely familiar with Satan's interactions with humanity should recognize a theme straight out of that playbook).

I'm stunned and more than a little disappointed to read glowing endorsements of this film, and this kind of thinking within these reviews.  Then again, given the amount of Godlessness in our culture, it's surprising that more films like this aren't being screened to practically empty movie houses.

3860508,2,B00275EHC8,"In the Invention of Lying we are presented with a world that has never known a lie. Everyone tells the truth at all times. This is so ingrained into the society that people don't even edit themselves as this must be considered to be a kind of deception by the writer and director, Gervais. So imagine that one man has mysteriously stumbled upon a way to say something that ""wasn't.""

In a world like this someone who could lie would be a king! He would be rich, have any woman he wanted, be successful and even worshipped. In fact, Gervais' character does get all these things by his simple ability to deceive. Well, most of the time. Even this seemingly amoral liar seems to understand that the falsehood he tells are somehow wrong. After telling a beautiful woman that the world would end if she didn't have sex with him immediately he decides against it and tells her another lie so that he won't have to have sex with her. When given a chance to win the love of his life, he tells her the truth that would turn her away from him. Here is where the movie goes wrong for me.

In the film, there is an acknowledgement that lying is immoral yet lying is shown to be the path to all of the joys that this man would otherwise not have had. He is rich, he is famous and all because he lies. And there is no moral judgment against this. This isn't very surprising when we consider that Gervais writes himself in as a prophet of sorts, making up religion and belief in the ""man in the sky"" while holding two pizza boxes with a sort of 10 Commandments feel to the scene. This is the commentary of Gervais shining through. It is obvious that he doesn't consider lying to be immoral. He considers religion to be a lie (in this world of only truth telling no one believes in God?)

In my opinion, a morality tale would better fit this setup than a romantic comedy. Even the director may have seen his match with Jennifer Gardner as a mis-match as they have almost no chemistry and never kiss on screen. After the movie moves past the hilarious, unfiltered language at the start it moves into a celebration of immorality with no lessons to be learned and no growth in character. Everything is too easy and too unbelievable. It all works out for everyone, of course, except for the movie watcher. Not recommended.",1267401600,3,2302,4.39906103286385

3860510,1,B00275EHC8,"The Invention of Lying is written by and stars Ricky Gervais. Gervais is the British comedian that became know to many Americans for his portrayal of David Brent in the British TV hit ""The Office."" Gervais was great in The Office and he's been funny in bit parts in The Night at The Museum and in the movie ""Ghost Town.""

But, this movie is all his. He stars in it and writes it, and, as this movie's captain, he goes down with the sinking ship.

This movie isn't funny. All the funny parts are in the preview. Why? It is a one joke movie. Characters in the film CAN NOT TELL A LIE. So, when the beautiful Jennifer Garner tells Gervais she will go on a date with him but that he has no chance of sleeping with her and she never wants to have his kids because they will be fat and pug-nosed, it is funny. The first time. The same joke is not funny when it is repeated over and over.

That's the problem with this movie. Sure, it has a great cast that includes Garner, Rob Lowe, Jonah Hill and Louis CK. But, every character being honest and sincere and never lying gets stale and predictable after awhile.

I can't recommend this movie. It looks cheaply made and the gimmick doesn't work after twenty minutes. The poor quality of this movie has nothing to do with the entire plot thread about ""the man in the sky"" and where you go after you die. Some religious figures claimed it was offensive, but I think it is hard for someone to write good satire about religion when they have no idea what it means to be a believer in any faith. And that was apparent in this movie.",1267142400,7,1569,4.237458193979933

Although Gervais' persona is very different from Bill Murray's sharp-witted cad, his character needs to be sharper and more driven to make the comedy work.  Instead, his character is someone who is content to bumble and stumble through.

There are three significant categories of lying. First, lying to manipulate and exploit others--Gervais' character rejects this.  Second, ""white lying"" as a social lubricant and to comfort others.  This is the core of the lying by Gervais' character, but with one exception, these lies are too inconsequential to be interesting.  Third, lying to cover-up a previous lie.  Gervais' character indulges in this, but there is no sense of danger from the original lie being uncovered, and thus the cover-up is not frenetic, which is the basis of comedy for such situations.

The movie has a romantic comedy component. A large part of romance are the lies we tell ourselves and each other, and thus was a great set-up for when one side is clueless about this.  Unfortunately, there is little more than what you see in the trailers, and even that wasn't funny (It is funny in the trailers simply because of the unexpected contrast of what is being said with how it is said, but that no longer applies when you see the movie).

Similarly, the remainder of the script is totally unimaginative--bland and overly predictable--and I couldn't stop thinking of ways it could have become much, much funnier. Many of the jokes felt very familiar, as if they had been lifted from a stand-up comedy routine.

Although religion has been a rich source of humor, the treatment here is so ham-handed and misdirected that even those who aren't religious may find it just plain mean-spirited, even despicable.

Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) is attracted to Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais) however; his pudgy physique and plug nose would not contribute properly to the gene pool. Therefore, he would not make a suitable mate.

But wait, we live in a world where lying is impossible. But wait still, Mark has discovered the secret. He tests his ability on a lady in the street; ""the world is going to end if we don't have sex right now."" Armed with this knowledge will Mark explained to Anna that being rich and successful will change his gene pool capabilities?

The movie goes steaming along until it is bogged down in a pizza box scene. Here Mark experiments with lying to the masses.

3860534,5,B00275EHC8,"I loved this movie. It's sweet, and funny and really quite brilliant. It is about an imaginary world where no one can lie (and no one has ever been able to lie), and what happens to the very human, but kind-hearted man who first becomes able to. Though his intentions are mostly altruistic (remember, I also said he is very human, so he also does things to benefit himself), he inadvertently causes some big problems in his world. It's all very funny and sweet.

Yes, there are some strong references to the idea that religion is completely made-up, for the purpose of comforting people and calming their fears of death. For someone who can actually *think* about religion, instead of being a knee-jerk reactionary or dogmatic follower, it provides some terrific things to think about.

The first twenty minutes or so with its crude and not terribly funny dialogue made me wince, but being a fan of Ricky Gervais I had the patience to let the story unfold at its own pace. As it did so, I was treated to some of the humor and wit that makes Gervais fun. (I also enjoyed the brief cameo featuring his writing partner, Stephen Merchant.) By the time we arrived at Gervais' character Mark explaining ""The Man in the Sky"" to a crowd of eagerly inquisitive people (with the help of his pizza box ""tablets""), I was hooked. Honestly; how could anyone not see the humor in that scene?

For those who insist that Gervais is pushing an ""agenda"", I can only respond by asking ""When did everyone become so paranoid""? Lighten up please; has the world been listening to too much inflammatory right wingnut radio, or WHAT? It seems extreme to flip out just because someone dares to think (refreshingly and thankfully) outside the box...in any case the story suggests that perhaps people ought to consider being ""good for goodness' sake"" (sorta like Santa Claus), rather than always seeking a ""reward"".

3860567,2,B00275EHC8,"I was excited about this film.  Ricky Gervais has been one of the freshest, most honest voices in comedy in recent memory.  He's never been afraid to tackle the taboo or the downright offensive.  And I expected as much with this one.  Knowing his personal animus towards religion, I knew what I was getting in to.

You have to know that the crux of this film centers upon Mark Bellison ""creating"" religion out of a heartfelt attempt to comfort his dying mother.  In many ways, this was an inspired idea.  Unfortunately, the viewer is absolutely beaten over the head with the symbolism.  When it comes time to speak to the masses about what the ""Man in the Sky"" told him, Mark writes what he wants everyone to know on two sheets of paper.  ""I wish I had some tablets, or even just some nicer paper,"" he quips.  And thus begins the repeated, and tortuous, pushing of the agenda.  Personal feelings about religion aside, its just too much.

And my other big problem with this film is that the filmmakers are not true to the universe they've created.  Being unable to tell a lie is not the affliction from which the characters suffer; they are incapable of tact, character, manners, or being decent human beings.  It is one thing to never tell a lie; it is quite another for random people to stop the main character on the street to berate his genetic shortcomings.

Despite these flaws, there is one quite excellent scene that displays that Gervais, while a gifted comedian and surveyor of our culture, is quite a gifted actor.  The scene in which he tells his mother that death is not an ""eternity of nothingness"" but that she goes to a happy place with everyone she loves is pure brilliance.  To borrow a phrase from Orson Welles, that scene ""would make a stone cry.""  Additionally, Gervais handles the ending, and his character's ""sins,"" so to speak, quite deftly in an attempt to regain Mark Bellison's humanity (despite another glaring inconsistency in the universe he creates-I don't want to spoil it, so I won't discuss it here).

I imagine that one who agrees with Gervais's views on religion might find the repeated bludgeoning of the symbolism comedic, but I did not.  I found it a cheap and easy way out.  So, despite a few redeeming qualities and an inspired scene or two from Gervais, the film underwhelms and belies Gervais's previous film outings, notably the surprisingly deft and funny ""Ghost Town.""",1265587200,7,2413,4.684085510688836

Of course, it was completely atheistic in it's message and mockery of religion, but at the same time it was so incredible (as in, not believable) that I found it more boring than offensive.

In the end, God will not be mocked. EVERY knee will bow, and EVERY tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is LORD. Including the writer of this film.

3860572,1,B00275EHC8,"We LOVED Ricky Gervais in everything we have seen him in until now.  Just as my husband put the movie in he mentioned that Gervais is an athiest.  Well, I felt sorry for him but intended to enjoy the movie because the man is hysterical. He can really deliver a line and I find him adorable.

Well, it starts off with lots of references to sex..and in crude ways. I'm not a prude...but you do NOT want your children watching this...especially in the first ten minutes.

Then the movie proceeds to make a POINT of putting down and making fun of everyone who believes in God. God is a 'made up' character by Gervais in this movie.  Everyone in the movie tells the truth, 100% of the time.  Only at a point does Gervais' character become the first person EVER..ANYWHERE to tell a lie.

He uses this lie to commit crimes (for money and hopefully sex...) and eventually help some folks.  Then when he needs answers about his lies...he makes up ""god"" and calls him the man in the sky who kills people, causes all sin and strife and sickness in the world...but also causes good things to happen.

THEN he goes to church, where a sign outside says ""A quiet place to sit and think about the man in the sky.""  While the first second, this is funny..the next you realize it.  Gervais, Garner, not-so-shockingly Lowe, are all making fun of anyone who has the slightest belief in God at all.

I was sad that Gervais not only starred in it, but wrote it.

I wish I had never rented it or watched it. At the very, very least, I will closely scrutinize every movie I see any of the 'stars' of this movie...taking part in.  Funny, Garner seems so wholesome and sweet, but I really hated her in this, for lots of reasons.  Sad, sad, sad movie, and even if you are an athiest or whatever, it's just not very funny and it really drags in parts.",1265414400,12,1823,4.336283185840708

3860594,5,B00275EHC8,"Based on the previews/trailers for this film, I wasn't interested. However, upon seeing it..I find it incredibly fantastic. Like most movies, it isn't perfect(nothing is) Within the first five minutes, I was cracking up laughing. It's a movie that is almost a reflection of real life if we all indeed told the truth constantly. Some people are saying it's odd, but it's real in my opinion. It's a comedy based upon what most of us think, but would probably never say to anyone's' face.

There is one thing that did bother me a bit. Some of the characters seemed to lack real emotion and intellect(the minor and random characters) The scenarios in the film are a bit unrealistic at times. But, that's the point of a movie..to entertain. I would not recommend this movie to someone who is very, very serious in their faith, since it may offend those types of people.

Bottom line: If you can take a joke and laugh at the imperfections in people(and movies for that matter), I strongly recommend seeing this!(My first review so I hope I did well everyone)",1265241600,3,1052,4.681081081081081
3860595,3,B00275EHC8,"At the start of THE INVENTION OF LYING, I thought immediately of the comedian Daniel Tosh.  In his album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Stories-I-Made-Up/dp/B000LPR3B8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Stories I Made Up</a>, he makes this statement as one of his jokes: ""You wanna make your life better with zero work on your part?  Start lying about everything in your life.""  Tosh's album came out four years before this movie, and it seems like that line is the direct heart behind the film's whole premise.

The movie takes place in a fictional world where the concept of lying has never existed.  What this means is that fiction is nonexistent, so movies are simply protracted history lectures.  It also means (as Gervais has envisioned it) that the human race has evolved to lack any tact whatsoever.  People don't just tell the truth; they tell it without any provocation and every chance they get.

There's a difference between honesty and full disclosure, but the movie doesn't care about that.  It's funnier (for a little while, anyway) to watch everyone give their unfiltered opinions of each other without twitching an eye.  It's as if the Earth is filled with erudite children.  The world is immature, but it is also placidly and ably vocal about it.

Mark (Gervais's character) is a put upon fellow, mainly because he's so pudgy (an observation that Gervais's script makes literally two or three dozen times), but when he develops the ""ability"" to lie, just as Tosh predicted, his life becomes instantly better.  Since deception has never been conceived of, the world believes his every word, and thus he gets everything he's ever wanted.

With the exception of Anna (Jennifer Garner).  The first half of the movie, if not repetitive, is still fun (not the least of which for the numerous cameos -- Tambor, Norton, Hoffman, Fey, and many others).  However, when Mark accidentally creates the concept of heaven and a ""man in the sky,"" things begin to spiral out of hand.  Both for him, and for the plot.

At this point, the movie, fumbling with such a grand premise, chooses to focus on Mark's attempted wooing of Anna, who loves Mark, but can't bring herself to be with him because of his weak ""genetic code.""  The problem here is that Gervais seems interested in Anna solely because she's so hot.  Otherwise she's as clueless, selfish, and inconsiderate as the rest of the world.  Likewise, much is made of how much fun Anna has with Mark, but their times together are always cut off before the audience is allowed to see any kind of real chemistry.

Lacking that chemistry, the film becomes a vehicle for an old moral: don't judge a book by its cover.  This could've been a complex statement, considering that Gervais's cover is not just pudgy but also riddled now with lies, but the movie turns it into the simplest of valentines.  It should also be pointed out that the second half of the film feels very much like a promotion of atheism or -- at the very least -- a explanation of what Gervais believes is at the heart of both humanity and religion, namely, more selfishness and a complete disavowal of personal responsibility.  To religious believers, the film will certainly come across as a slap in the face, although I doubt it was intended as such.",1265068800,5,3319,4.936936936936937
3860596,3,B00275EHC8,"***DISCLAIMER***
I don't intend to criticize the opinions and thoughts of the writer(s), director(s) or actor(s). I consider the media a medium for conversation. And as in any conversation, two way communication is allowed and therefore different opinions can be expressed without the necessity of one being imposed over the other nor any one considered better or worse than the other.

Now, with the people rating the movie one star, I've found that most (if not all) claim to profess one faith and use that faith as a basis for the criticism and dislike of the movie. I'm Christian too and I don't intend to minimize their point of view either. It's just a call to think and re-think before jumping and talking in (some sort of) representation of a group they claim to belong.

Imagine you go to a public place. And by accident you sat on a chewing gum. Nobody tells you anything (although some noticed and some did not). But then 3 year old kid notices it and starts laughing at you to the point that it feels like mockery. How would you react? Would you jump on him with a lecture on morals? Would you start fighting back? Would you look for defects on him to start mocking too? I believe that if you are mature enough, you will laugh, try to clean the gum and keep walking. You will not live with that gum on your behind (or the shame) all your life, will you?

Well, that's exactly what is going on here.

 The movie assumes there is something wrong with humankind. And there is. The film tackles the problem with the issue of truth/lie. But there are several flaws on his understanding of truth because it seems in the movie that not being able to lie is also not being able to recognize beauty and what is good on others and the world. He seems to get it at the end of the movie, but that is a HUGE flaw if you read the movie as a philosophical statement.

It also seems to confuse not being able to lie (or saying always the truth) with some sort of stupidity and numbness to all reality and common sense. That is another flaw.

It gives the impression that supposes Christianity as a system of beliefs, do's and don'ts in order to go to the better place (sadly some Christians do too). But when you see that it did not change the people's hope for this life, you see why it is criticizing that system. Christianity is not a system of beliefs, it is not a list of do's and don'ts in order to go to heaven, there is no scoreboard counting three wrong doing to send you to hell. And the questions the film poses in that regard are worth considering. If your Christianity is threatened by a film like this, maybe you haven't got it.

The film ends recognizing there is beauty in the truth and in others (solving the problem of now), but it leaves a big hole in the future denying the existence of ""the man in the sky"". But I don't blame them. It will never make sense if you see the earth and the sky as separate entities. The ""man on the sky"" made himself ""the man on the earth"" so all men on the earth can relate to the ""man on the sky"" so the ""man on the sky"" can live on the earth. So, in the future, there will be no difference between earth and sky.  See what I mean? You will deny the man in the sky if you don't have a worldview that includes now/future and earth/sky going on at the same time. Many don't even know what I'm talking about, and the film doesn't either.

Now, what with the gum and the kid? I see this film as a kid mocking about a real problem that will be taken care of. But being a kid, his views are flawed and shortsighted. Since he is not mature enough, you cannot demand standards of moral and behavior. So, the best thing to do is recognize the gum, laugh, clean it and be nice. This will give the kid a lesson on life and on who you really are. And maybe, when he grows up, he will want to be like you.",1265068800,3,3840,4.226466575716235

  I can't remember the last time a movie made me think, brought tears to my eyes, and made me laugh from end to end, all at the same time.  It's a real roller coaster as comedies go, and one of the rare times you'll feel like you got more than your money's worth at the theater.

  Gervais and Garner have unusual chemistry, and you'll wonder what a woman like her sees in him looks-wise; but in the mixed-up rules of this alternate reality, it's excusable.  All the supporting roles work -- especially Jonah Hill and Tina Fey -- and the ending satisfies.

  The only folks I've seen who didn't like this film were those who are both extremely religious and very proudly ignorant, at the same time.  Part of the film has a parody of modern religion in it that's very on-point, and some people are threatened by this.  You would think that those with such strong beliefs would be indifferent to a simple comedy, but apparently some world views are more fragile than others.  I can only advise you to not put too much stock in reviews that consist of ""I walked out halfway through the film!""

The characters don't just 'not lie', they come out and say whatever cruel thing they happen to be thinking, whether they're asked or not, because Ricky Gervais thinks it might be funny to write down an insult about someone's height, or intelligence, clothes.

3860625,3,B00275EHC8,"The alternate universe presented by co-writers and directors Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson in this 2009 comedy is a world of such unfettered honesty that the human race has become devoid of any imagination or creative energy. It's a clever idea to show how mundane life would become without any deception, and the premise is explored with laser-sharp sparks of wit during the movie's first half. The problem is that Gervais and Robinson also want to tell a feel-good love story, and that's where their grand concept falls short. It's a film that brings to mind Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truman-Show/dp/B0009UC7QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Truman Show</a>&nbsp;since both share a meticulous view of a skewed society and a jaundiced perspective on the people who surround the put-upon protagonist. However, Weir's movie at least reflects a more audacious sensibility that turned out to be prescient with the advent of reality television. Gervais and Robinson, on the other hand, set out to create a broad fantasy landscape and then fall back to romantic comedy formula when the questions become too big for their movie to answer. It's a disappointing turn of events.

The plot centers on Mark Bellison, a lecture-film writer who is convinced by everyone around him that he is an abject failure. He goes out on a blind date with Anna McDoogles, a beautiful woman who readily admits she is not attracted to him physically or financially. However, she likes him regardless, and this is meant to tether us to their evolving relationship. When Mark loses his job and is unable to pay the rent, he comes upon an unprecedented solution...he lies to the bank teller about how much money is in his account, and she, of course, believes him since everyone tells the truth. Mark immediately recognizes his new-found power and tries to help his bedridden mother and suicidal neighbor as a matter of course. However, he inadvertently lands on a bigger ticket item, the idea of faith. He invents the concept of ""the man in the sky"" and a code of ethics that he scribbles down overnight on two pizza boxes that are made to look like Moses' tablets. The scene where he attempts to explain these proclamations to the anxious throngs is the movie's funniest bit. Up to this point, most of the humor is derived from the characters surrounding Mark, all of whom are so committed to telling the truth that they can't help but share too many embarrassing details.

However, the movie doesn't have any place to go thematically and ends up on a simplistic message: don't judge a book by its cover. The relationship between Mark and Anna is rather mystifying since it presumes that Anna is worthy of Mark's obsession. That is truly arguable. It takes all of Jennifer Garner's considerable charms to make the character remotely likeable, but she remains a pinheaded cipher due to the constraints of the story's premise. As Mark, Gervais remains clever and likeable but is not actor enough to give his character any dimension beyond misbegotten prevaricator and smitten puppy. Rob Lowe has already proven adept at playing handsome cads, and he again shows his comic chops as Mark's genetically superior rival for Anna's heart. Among several star cameo appearances from the likes of Edward Norton and Christopher Guest, Tina Fey provides the funniest moments as Mark's heartless secretary. The extras on the 2010 DVD are worthwhile, including a comic featurette, ""Prequel: The Dawn of Lying"", which shows how cavemen invented lying as an unbilled Patrick Stewart provides a stentorian voiceover. Other extras include another comic short spotlighting Karl Pilkington, Gervais' co-host on ""The Ricky Gervais Show""; a satirical making-of featurette; additional scenes and outtakes; and intermittently amusing video podcasts from Gervais and Robinson.",1264550400,4,3911,5.246006389776358

Not only do people not lie, they do not censor their thoughts, and therefore what's said can seem absurdly insensitive.  Nobody ever questions the truth, because there is nothing other than the truth to question.

When her mother calls mid date Anna says she does not find Rich attractive, and she will not be having sex with him, as he is not a genetic match, and she does not want her children having snub noses.  We get to know Rich by his reaction.  In fact he is the one person in this world who does not have to say everything he thinks.

As events unfold disastrously for Rick, he finds himself in the position where he becomes the first liar.  Telling the lie opens up opportunities, and ultimately becomes the path to fame and fortune if not to his hearts desire.  It's an exploration of truth and lies, and not a glorification of either one.

Ultimately, he becomes the first person to posit thoughts about the afterlife, which everyone believes without question. However, he recognises that lying to Anna, while it would work will yield only a hollow victory. Is it possible to win Anna from the clutches of the perfect match without lying?

While Ricky Gervais may not be your typical leading man, he does have a tremendous and admirable creative ability, as evidenced by his creating the BBC series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-The-Complete-Collection-BBC-Edition-First-And-Second-Series-Plus-Special/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extras-The-Complete-Series-Includes-Series-Finale/dp/B000YI99IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extras - The Complete Series (Includes Series Finale)</a>, and a tremendous understanding of comedy.  The American Office starring Steve Carell, has now run successfully for multiple seasons.

Having previously only experienced Jennifer Garner as a dramatic actrees, and not being overly impressed, I was impressed by how great a comedienne she is here. I did not buy into Anna and Rich as a romantic couple, but the whole movie is very cleverly done.

When I returned to my local video store, I noticed Invention of Lying was sold out, four vacant shelves of dvd cards.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover-R-Rated-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002Q4VBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover (R-Rated Single-Disc Edition)</a>, had two shelves and only half sold out. That says a lot about this movie. I found Invention of Lying to be one of the better comedies I have seen recently. He is a clever clogs, isn't he?

This movie won't appeal to everyone.  Inevitably, though specific deity names are not mentioned, one can form the opinion that the the 'man in the sky' is some convenient fiction, which it is, to convey Ricky Gervais atheist beliefs, which it does, and some people will interpret this as an attack on their beliefs, and find it offensive.  If you feel you might fall into that category, then I recommend you skip this one.  Get Extras instead.

It isn't genius but it's definitely watchable; funny at times. The concept is more like something you might have thought up after eating some special brownies. You may have started off with a rather common question like, ""What if the idea of God was a lie?"" After the brownies, your question may become, ""What if the idea of God was the FIRST lie?"" Now you have The Invention of Lying. Add in boobie jokes from Phillip S. Hoffman, some masterbation jokes from Jennifer Garner, and some brutal honesty from an ultra sassy Tina Fey - and you have the movie. In the beginning, nobody could lie. But they could make honest mistakes. That didn't seem to matter when Ricky asked for more dollars than he had in the bank. Also, just because people couldn't lie doesn't mean they would say everything that is on their mind. If those kinds of small things bother you in movies, stay away.

3860629,2,B00275EHC8,"I want to address the religious issue first. The premise for this movie is that in this world, the human brain does not have the connections needed for lying. It's not physically possible. Suddenly the main character played by Ricky Gervais' develops the connections and has the ability to lie. In this script, not only do the people of this world not have the ability to recognize a lie, they don't recognize mistakes. Anything anyone says is accepted as fact. So when Ricky Gervais says that he really has more in his bank account then he does, they give him the money without question.

While his mother is dying she experiences terrible fear, and in an effort to give her peace, Gervais makes up a story about a heaven-like eternal place. Since the people in this alternate world have no knowledge of lying, his mom believes his story and so do the doctors. They and the world want to know more about this place, and Ricky creates ""the Man in the Sky"" and his rules.

Many people of faith have taken offense by this, and see it as an attack against religion. I don't know the writer's intent (Gervais was one of the writers). Most likely they did mean to make religion seem like man's fantasy to gain comfort. On the other hand, it may have just been an attempt at humor from people who don't have any strong religious convictions.

In the movie's alternative world, no one understands lying and no one questions anything anyone else says. When Gervais tells everyone about the Man in the Sky, no one doubts him. In the reality of our world, the bible has been completely questioned, studied and scrutinized for centuries. It has come through all this, and has proven accurate and dependable. It's been found to be historically, scientifically and prophetically accurate. (This book addresses that:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Evidence-That-Demands-A-Verdict-Fully-Updated-To-Answer-The-Questions-Challenging-Christians-Today/dp/0785242198/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Evidence That Demands A Verdict Fully Updated To Answer The Questions Challenging Christians Today</a>

So in essence, this movie doesn't discount religion in our real world, but only in this alternative world. However those who are weak in faith may take the ideas in this movie to heart, so I would not recommend it. Those who do have faith may just find it sad to see this type of story line and viewpoint from people who have no concept of what it's like to have the power and presence of God in their lives.

Lastly, I do agree with the reviewer who said that the movie glorfies lying, and uglifies truth. I also agree that this film was just not that funny. I was quite bored throughout most of it. I usually find Ricky Gervais to usually be absolutely hilarious, but this movie fell flat. A world where no one can lie is a great premise. I hope to see more from Gervais in the future, but hopefully he'll think twice about offending such a huge part of the American population. I'm sure it doesn't pay.",1264377600,3,3043,5.017821782178218

I was disappointed in this movie.  In addition to always telling the truth, everyone in the film seems to have to express every thought they have.  It's like they have OCD or something and must blurt out weird truths to complete strangers.

And overall, the film wasn't that funny.  Garner is delightful, Gervais is fine, but it was just...blah.

1) first uglify honesty
2) then glorify lying
3) then say God is a lie
4) then even though he is the only person who can communicate with God and famous and rich -- so rare -- he is the one and only in the world -- that should make him very attractive, she doesn't like him

5) when he told her he made up God, at the end of the movie, she loved him all of a sudden.  Is it because of honesty?  If it is, then Brad (the other guy) has always been honest.

so is the ending trying to make people happy for seeing the movie, for giving them a happy ending and hope?  and what is (1) to (4) about?

there may be a small idea that white lie is good: that he told his mom that after people die, they go to a really nice place.

But at the end of the movie, he still live in the rich mansion -- so he is lying for his personal gain.  Is that a white lie?

Also, he and his son is eating breakfast, and looking at the burned food from his wife, he said the food is fantastic.  The son said so too.  So won't the wife think if it is so good, why aren't you eating it?  Or maybe the wife just believe everything he says, like ""It is really great, but I am full so i ate only 1 bite"".  Or he can eat it and get cancer -- eating burned food for a long time will get cancer.  So at the end, I still don't know what the ""lying"" message is.",1264032000,5,1358,3.7157894736842105
3860644,5,B00275EHC8,"I loved this movie and would definitely recommend it, but I suppose it's not for everyone. The humor is often on the dark side, obviously controversial to some people based on a few of the reviews I've read, or maybe it's just too subtle for others. But therein lies the beauty of it for me.

I didn't perceive the religious twists that others have mentioned as derogatory or offensive in any way, because the whole concept is that no one had ever heard of or even thought of those things before. If someone insisted on being technical, I'd argue that the film represented many sides of the ""meaning of life."" It also attempted to show the emptiness that the people in the story had felt without the previous hope of something more than the ""here and now,"" without preaching some deep, hidden message ... because it's a comedy, pure and simple.

It was intended to be a satirical scenario of how life would be if absolutely no form of untruth had never existed, everything single was taken literally, and no one had the forethought, compassion or basic ability to control what they were thinking verses what came out of their mouth. That would definitely change the world as we know it, and I for one don't want to know everything people think about me!

I love a story that has something for everyone with an open mind ... to things they may or may not agree with personally, dark and/or subtle humor with a little racy humor thrown in, romance, scenarios that you might totally relate to, and most of all a view of something you'd never thought about before (or maybe you had!).

Ricky Gervias is amazing at portraying a typical person who like almost everyone - good or bad - is a lot more than meets the eye. Ghost Town is a ""must see"" if you enjoyed this film.",1263945600,6,1765,4.489096573208723

I am leaving the content descriptions/opinion to others as I have noticed each review becomes a discussion of religion and beliefs. The Blu clarity was standard throughout and the TrueHD holds normal for a comedy. There were really no reference points to talk about, and I admittedly had more fun watching the supplements than the film, they include: (all lodef)

* The famous ""prequel"", 6:30 minutes. Watch this first as it allows the other supplements to make more sense. Patrick Stewart has a nice cameo narration here, and our entire cast performs a caveman routine that is almost funnier than the film.
* Making of, 7:17 minutes. A great deal about Gervais' laugh, jokes on the set, fun stuff.
* Karl Pilkington cave sequence, 17:48 minutes. You have to be a huge fan of Gervais and their style of writing for this. Covers the ""story"" behind one of their crew being cut from the deleted scene of the film, felt like an episode of the Office.
* Podcasts, 4 totaling 10 minutes. Dry clips telling about their Nerf gun fights and set tours.
* Additional scenes, 5 totaling 7 minutes. Glad most of them were cut.
* Corpsing and outtakes, 5:34 minutes. The two things I got out of this was to not watch these first (as I did - made no sense; cavemen thing) and to listen to a quick Gervais joke in the casino scene, hilarious.

3860647,4,B00275EHC8,"Gervais took a really good idea and did a so-so job of running with it; it's a long way from being unable to lie to having to say something obnoxious or ridiculous about everything.  Some of the characters blurt out things that are funny, but not realistic even within the Universe as Gervais saw it.  Yet, on the whole, the film is modestly entertaining and moves along pretty well.

The film is religously irreverent in a European sort of way, with Gervais doing a pretty funny Moses bit. As a result, the Christian Family Hate League put out a fatwa against the movie, and a number of reviewers on other sites panned it without seeing it.  It IS worth seeing.",1263600000,8,662,4.491666666666666
3860648,4,B00275EHC8,"Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson co-write and co-direct The Invention of Lying, a film I honestly did not expect to like. I'm familiar with Gervais and have heard great things about him, but somehow his TV shows and movies have eluded me. The Invention of Lying is my introduction to him and it makes for great entertainment.

Gervais plays Mark Bellison, who lives in alternate reality where the human race has not adapted the ability to lie. It's hard to deny this is an interesting idea and the opening scenes of the film are quite funny. Mark works as a screenwriter at a film studio, where films consist of a man on screen reading a script based on an event in history. Writing a story requires a certain amount of lying, after all. On the verge of getting fired and rejected by the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Garner) because he's overweight; Mark sees his life in a downward spiral. On the eve of being evicted from his apartment, Mark tells the world's first lie and with his newfound ability a way to improve his life in every aspect.

The film has an eclectic cast including Jonah Hill (as Mark's suicidal neighbor), Jeffrey Tambor, Rob Lowe (as an esteemed screenwriter), and Tina Fey. Furthermore, there are two very funny cameos by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as a bartender) and Edward Norton (as a cop).

The entire alternate reality is a marvelous idea and Gervais keeps it from growing old within minutes. The Coke/Pepsi gags, as well as the brutally honest business names are consistently amusing.

Obviously, The Invention of Lying is built on a gimmick. In the hands of lesser writers, this gimmick could have run out of steam very quickly, yet Gervais keeps the wit, social commentary (involving religion), and energy consistent throughout. The Invention of Lying is a strong comedy film that had me laughing very hard, but also had me thinking. If the film didn't descend into predictability towards the end (while still retaining its charm), I would say it's one of my favorite films of 2009. Alas, Gervais has fashioned a comedy that is smart, underrated, and very well-done...Definitely worth your time.

It would have been great for 5 minutes, but at the 90 minutes + it's too much. Also, it's not so much a ""world without lying"" as a ""world without telling every single thing you're thinking of"" and the movie rings false.

3860652,2,B00275EHC8,"First, what I liked about the film:
- Very 'smart' idea.  The plot is high concept, but it is pulled off nicely.
- Some supporting cast members steal the show.  Jonah Hill is funny (his part is way too small), and Ed Norton's cameo was excellent.
- Filming location was excellent!  Though, I am biased with this point, as I grew up around there (Lowell, MA).

What I didn't like:
- The acting, in general, was not good.  As someone else stated, Gervais let all the comedy/jokes go to others as he just reacted.  It just didn't work.  Garner was robotic as the love interest.  Lowe was...acceptable...as the protagonist.  Tambor was underutilized.  Philip Seymour-Hoffman's cameo should have been bigger.  It just seemed like having all these known actors was more of a boost to Gervais's ego than it was about adding something to the film.  To further that, Louis CK's character was relatively pointless and wasn't all that funny for playing the dumb sidekick.  There's no denying Stephen Merchant's chemistry with Gervais, so not using him for that role amazed me.
- The story, while a smart, new idea, was relatively boring and disjointed.  Even at 90 minutes, the story tends to drag on and make it seem like its been playing for much longer than that.
- The end of the film was predictable and formulaic.  Gervais reveals to Garner the 'truth' about his lies, and she seems unmoved at the revelation of his ability or what his decisions have caused, and the film ends 'Happily Ever After.'  For such a high concept film, to have such a predictable, expected ending was a major disappointment.
- If Coca-Cola was first invented as a 'medicine' by John Pemberton, how is it that it ever existed (as, technically, its marketing as such would be a lie since it was never proven to be a medicine).
- It seems as though the movie acknowledges that 'love' exists in the lie-free world, but people ignore it over more common sense regarding passing on good genes or practical reasoning.  But that implies that the person who marries for love is actually living a lie.  I didn't understand that part of the film, as since they do end up together, does that mean Garner is lying to herself about being with Gervais?  Does the movie say love is basically a lie?  I don't see the relation between telling the truth and not being together for love.

In short, for someone of Gervais' talent, the movie was very flat.  Its one of those films that may look like a grand idea on paper, but transferring it to film leaves a lot to be desired.  After seeing it, I have no lingering question as to why the studio basically sat on the film for a year before releasing it, as it just wasn't that good.  I do hope Gervais gets more opportunities to make his films, but if more of them are along these lines, I'll hope he sticks to podcasts and TV shows.",1261353600,4,2835,4.546351084812623

There's plenty to enjoy, from Gervais' offhanded and charming performance to the strong supporting cast, including hilarious small roles for Lowe and Fey plus terrific cameos by Jason Bateman, Christopher Guest and other Gervais stalwarts.

Gervais plays screenwriter Mark, a ""chubby little loser"" who knows that the lovely Anna (Jennifer Garner) is out of his league as soon as they meet. She doesn't disabuse him of the notion. His life goes from bad to worse when he is sacked and faces the possibility of eviction.

Desperation is the mother of invention, and the world's first lie is told when he convinces a bank teller that there is more money in his account than appears on her screen. He now has discovered the ability to bend a trusting world to his will.

Gervais once again appears to be using comedy as therapy to work out his personal insecurities. His screen alter ego is consistently branded a fat, underachiever but you know the purpose of the film will be to celebrate the triumph of this underdog and ensure that he wins the love of a gorgeous woman.

The obvious scenario unfolds with a ready wit and an engaging sense of playfulness. I truly loved this movie!",1260576000,12,1395,4.8
3860664,1,B00275EHC8,"Is God just a desperate fib?

That's one of the main plot points in this movie, co-written and starring British actor/comedian Ricky Gervais.

The movie creates a world where everyone tells the truth - all the time, no matter what - with funny and often awkward results. Then Gervais' character stumbles upon telling the first fib.

After a few untruths, Gervais is confronted by his mother, dying in a hospital bed and full of fear for her future. In order to bring her some comfort, he drops what is presented to viewers as a big, fat, glow-in-the-dark lie: When her life on earth is done, his mother doesn't simply become nothing. She goes on to a happy existence living in a mansion and reuniting with all her already-dead loved ones.

Apparently, the world created by Gervais has no spiritual books such as a Bible, because this is amazing news to the hospital staff, who overhear the ""lie"" and demand to know more. Word spreads and soon, hundreds of people surround Gervais' house and he's forced to ""create"" a faith system with commandments (scrawled the back of pizza boxes) and a man in the sky dispensing favour and punishment.

One journalist, ignoring this very unfunny white elephant, wrote The Invention of Lying ""recalls cinema classics like Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life - as much message as mirth."" The message, according to this journalist, is lying isn't always a bad thing.

Unaware of Gervais' main plotline, my wife and I went to the theatre to watch this movie. When it finished, we walked out feeling sad.

For us, the message of The Invention of Lying is spirituality is a joke that exists only because we're all liars. And this is presented without a shred of evidence to back it up.

Where does the universe come from? The movie doesn't address this. What about a monumental figure like Jesus - his life and the revelations he told us about the nature of God? This is simply ignored. St. Paul, one of the writers of the Bible's New Testament, described how hundreds of people saw Jesus resurrected from the grave after his death on the cross. Apparently this doesn't matter, either.

How about the thousands of documented cases of near-death experiences that suggest an afterlife? They supposedly don't exist. A book like the Bible was written by more than 50 people over thousands of years; are they all liars? The casual, unspoken inference from Gervais is yes.

My wife's mother died not long ago and the hospital scene was a slap in the face for her (despite knowing the truth is quite different). Even for people who haven't lost a loved one recently, the message from Gervais is utter hopelessness. Unless we fool ourselves with a lie, all of us die and become nothing, he suggests. We'll never see loved ones again and we'll never meet God.

A classic along the lines of It's a Wonderful Life? Perhaps The Invention of Lying could have been that. But the former presented a compelling case for hope. The latter suggests only that we live for today and the person with the most toys when they die does, indeed, win. Win what, Ricky??",1259971200,12,3072,4.702048417132216

This is a movie about a world where people only know how to tell the truth no matter how inappropriate it might seem. But one day one of them (Ricky Gervais playing Mark Bellison) who is down on his luck has an evolutionary leap and realizes that he can tell a lie. From this point on he tries to improve himself, his position in life and those around him by creating fibs, though his primary motivation is to get the beautiful woman who has continually rejected him because she was out of his league. This film is extremely funny, though as it progresses it also develops a heartwarming, serious side, as the protagonist wrestles with his new powers and how far he should go using them to influence other people.",1257379200,,774,4.575539568345324
3860667,1,B00275EHC8,"Ricky Gervais is a brilliant comedian. You don't really need me to you that, you only need to watch the original version of ""The Office"" to see this. In addition to creating the memorable lead of this British television series, he and his longtime creative partner, Stephen Merchant, created the series, crafting an ensemble of memorable, very original and very funny characters. He was almost as good on the series ""Extras"". But he has had some difficulty transitioning to the role of movie star; he has appeared in a number of memorable supporting roles, but his two leading performances, so far, have been problematic, forgettable and pretty darn bad.

In ""Ghost Town"", he plays a dentist who has a near death experience and starts to see ghosts. One of these ghosts, played by Greg Kinnear, uses him to communicate with his wife, played by Tea Leoni, in an effort to prevent her from marrying a bad guy, played by Billy Campbell. The film is amusing and even funny at times, but the story is too high concept and Gervais is too low key to match the story. In the end, the result is little better than the dramedies populating the many television channels on your Direct TV satellite.

In his new film, ""The Invention of Lying"", Gervais again stars, this time as Mark Bellison, a struggling film writer, who lives in a typical small town on the East Coast of a very different America. In this America, no one lies, so conversations are uncomfortably awkward and movies are uncommonly dull. This time, Gervais has teamed with Matthew Robinson to co-write and co-direct. Robinson has no other credits listed on IMDB.com, so I am not sure where he came from.

Initially, the idea holds potential. As Bellison walks through town, we see some pretty honest advertisements. A billboard for Coca Cola announces that it is basically brown coloring, water and sugar. Another billboard for Pepsi announces, ""When you can't find a Coke"". These are amusing and instantly give us a picture of what this universe holds for us.

The film opens with Bellison headed to the apartment of Anna (Jennifer Garner). They are to go on a first date together. When she answers the door, she immediately voices her true feelings about Mark, the date, and his chances of having sex with her. They go to a little Italian place for dinner and the waiter immediately voices his feelings for Anna. He also states that he took a sip of the drink he is now serving her. And this continues.

Mark is having trouble at work. Bellison works for a movie company that basically films lecturers giving an oral history of a significant event or time period.
Each of the writers has been assigned a specific time period and Mark has difficulty making anything interesting out of the Black Plague and the other subjects he has to work with. Because of this, his films have not been successful and he learns he will probably be fired. When he arrives at work, his secretary (Tina Fey) happily passes on this information, along with her true feelings of him. As he sits in his office, he watches his boss (Jeffrey Tambor) walk by and stop for a second and then continue on before walking by again. Mark stops him and has to almost fire himself.

Mark's main rival, Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe) is having a phenomenal run of success. People are flocking to the films he makes, anxious to watch the lecturer (Christopher Guest) sit in a chair and relate the details of a historical event. Mark doesn't like Brad and Brad takes every opportunity to rub his success in Mark's face.

The next day, the landlord shows up and wants the rent. But Mark doesn't have it. He goes to his bank and wants to withdraw the money he has, but makes a sarcastic comment about how he 'would really like $800'. The teller assumes there has been a mistake and gives him the $800 instead. Mark has just invented a very valuable skill.

There are a lot of problems with ""The Invention of Lying"". An interesting idea quickly becomes flat when it becomes the only idea. Yes, there are variations on the theme, but it is essentially a one-note film. The first few times people spout their true feelings about someone or something, it takes us by surprise, shocking out a laugh. But people don't talk as much as they do in ""Lying""; they don't stop and psychoanalyze their feelings with every thought. Does not talking about your feelings make you a liar? That seems to be the idea behind a lot of this film because people immediately start telling others how they really feel as soon as they come together.

Something just occurred to me. There are more than a few moments when people say things like ""I have always loathed working for you"". Yet, through a lot of the film, people immediately tell their feelings and first impressions about someone when they first meet. If this is the practice in this world, why is someone just now saying ""I have always loathed working for you""? It doesn't seem like the narrative can and should have it both ways.

Also, a lot of these 'truths"" people voice are based on first impressions and that makes the characters seem shallow and mean. Certainly not likable or innocent. Because we don't really care about anyone in the film, we quickly lose interest.

Eventually, Mark learns of a way to get his job back and to become a very successful film writer. He starts to tell stories, to embellish the truth and creates something much more similar to the film we are watching. But when people ask where this information is coming from, because they aren't aware of the skill of lying, Mark states that he talks to The Man Upstairs. This leads to a number of the characters trying to get Mark to introduce them to The Man Upstairs and this leads to some obvious parodies aimed at organized religion. An idea that quickly becomes tiresome because they just aren't that original or interesting.

A lot of the problems in ""Lying"" come from Gervais portrayal of Bellison. He spends a lot of the film reacting to others and giving the appearance of being aggravated or annoyed with others. Are we to believe that Bellison is the only one in the world frustrated with this situation? Everyone else seems to accept it when people instantly tell their impressions to a person they have just met, or to update the status of their feelings during a date. But Mark seems to receive a fare share of highly critical remarks and observations, which are funny at first, but just seem to become more and more mean spirited as the story progresses. And he is frustrated about this. After Mark turns this situation to his advantage and starts to become a success, his persona seems to change and he seems to start regarding others with frustration. As in ""How can you be so dumb..."" Again, this is funny, briefly, in the beginning, but again, quickly becomes tiresome.

The other big problem with ""Lying"" is Jennifer Garner who plays Anna. She is just plain awful throughout the film. Immediately, her character states that she doesn't hold any hope for the date because Mark doesn't make enough money and the likelihood they will have sex on the first date is slim because Mark is fat and unattractive. Anna starts out as an extremely unlikable character. This isn't a bad thing, if there is some sort of metamorphosis throughout the story. But she doesn't change at all. Later, she becomes interested in Brad, because he is ""good looking"", successful, and wealthy. Everything she is. Everything she wants and should have. In other words, Mark is not up to her standards and Brad is.

Garner seems to think that Anna should be portrayed as Marilyn Monroe might portray the character. She talks in a seductive whisper and smiles a lot. Yet, she doesn't succeed at bringing Anna any smarts, she only makes Anna seem vapid and insecure.

Tina Fey is only in the film for a few minutes. As soon as Mark appears at work, she tells him that he is about to get fired and states ""I have always loathed working for you"". Again, how can the narrative have it both ways? If people are so quick to tell their impressions of people to them, why has it taken her character so long?

Rob Lowe is just plain creepy as Brad Kessler. Louis C.K., Jonah Hill, Fionula Flanagan and others pop up in equally unmemorable roles and don't really seem to understand what they are doing.

""The Invention of Lying"" is a film that goes very wrong, very quickly and can't recover.

3860668,5,B00275EHC8,"This film plays out like a British reality TV show. It just feels a bit off, but bear with it. That is part of its charm. Around 37 minutes into it (if memory serves), ""WHAM!"", it follows true reality and goes completely off script. That's all I can tell you. But here's why you really need to see this movie:

It's pure genius. The whole of it has a rather laid back feel, and the pacing is more a nice leisurely stroll through the park on a warm Autumn day than a Jason Bourne movie or the latest Transformers (both of which I enjoyed, but have nothing more to do with this review). This film draws you in slowly. For some of you it may seem a bit dry and boring, even pedantic at first--stay with it! This is the evolution of personal existence. This is real life as it happens. We go through our days performing our daily rituals and fulfilling our self-imposed duties and then we see something shiny and we pick it up, and suddenly the world starts to find color. This shiny new thing could be a relationship, or a new hobby, a passion for something we did not believe we could have before--or in this case--lying.

The point of this film is (naturally) to entertain us, but just underneath is a series of layered messages and thoughts to ponder on our own lives and the society we live in. In much the same way foreign films tend to attract a certain demographic, this film, feeling a lot like a film foreign to Americans (in pace and structure) is meant to attract people who want to THINK while they are being entertained, rather than wait for glimpses of Megan Fox in a wet bikini (and who doesn't want to do that?). This is truly a film worth owning, and it is a film worth watching a few times (spaced apart by a few months). It gets under your skin and stays with you--and it will without a doubt upset more than a few knee-jerk religionists, but that is the other half of the fun.

The movie is interesting, enjoyable and slow-paced enough to simultaneously allow the slow-to-catch-on to get the joke, but also allow those a bit faster on the up-take to digest the meaning of the joke while enjoying the film. Not at all a first date movie, but if you want to evaluate the relationship quality of your current romantic prospect, this is a MUST SEE. Much like Blazing Saddles, this movie will instantly tell you whether youa re dating the right person for you.

As always, thanks for reading :-)",1257033600,82,2407,4.378076062639821
3860669,2,B00275EHC8,"Ricky Gervais has been publicized as the combined reincarnation of Charlie Chaplin and Peter Sellers. But although I think the man has talent, I have yet to see any signs of genius from him. Indeed, ""The Invention of Lying,"" which Gervais co-wrote and co-directed with Matthew Robinson, suggests strongly he is reaching the limits of his competence. The story has a clever enough premise, postulating a world in which no one can even conceive of lying, tact, or imagination. People tell you flat out that they hate you or are threatened by you, movies consist strictly of armchair historical lectures, and nursing homes bear names such as, ""A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People.""

In this incessantly literal world, Mark Bellison (Gervais) suddenly discovers he can steal a march on everyone else by, in his words, saying things that aren't. He can get enough money to pay his rent by telling a bank teller he has more money in his account than he actually does; he can persuade a beautiful blonde to sleep with him by telling her the world will end if she doesn't. The plot goes on, providing fairly frequent chuckles and an occasional belly laugh, until the scene where Bellison sits by the deathbed of his mother (Fionnula Flanagan). The old lady is terrified at the prospect of eternal nothingness, so Bellison invents on the spur of the moment a beautiful place where dead souls go, where everyone has a mansion and is surrounded by everyone they loved in life. The old lady dies comforted, and the hospital staff, overhearing, demands to hear more.

This leads to the funniest scene in the movie--one worthy of Monty Python--in which Bellison is forced to invent religion on the spot, including commandments written on pizza boxes. (The constant product placements--not only Pizza Hut but also Coke, Pepsi, and Budweiser--are a major irritant in this film.) However, the film falls flat after this scene, because Gervais--rather than playing his bold heresy for all it's worth--retreats to the insipid love triangle between Bellison, the lovely Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) and the loathsome Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe).

I have two problems with ""The Invention of Lying""--one personal, one esthetic. As someone who, shall we say, doesn't keep a copy of ""The God Delusion"" on my coffee table, I feel insulted by Gervais' smug atheism, in which he asserts that plain truth equals a godless universe and anyone who disagrees is a self-deluded fool. But Gervais is entitled to his beliefs; the bigger problem for the movie is that he simply doesn't capitalize on his ""Man in the Sky"" plot twist, so that the story becomes a yawning gulf of missed opportunties. For example, politics: couldn't Bellison have a meteoric career in politics, outfoxing his opponents with constant pronouncments from The Man in the Sky? The opportunities for satirizing the current political scene, with its plethora of fanatics and hypocrites, were so juicy that I am dumbfounded Gervais avoided them. One weeps at the thought of what a Mark Twain, or even a George Carlin, could have done here.

""The Invention of Lying"" is stuffed with cameos by celebrities--Tina Fey, Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christopher Guest, Jason Bateman, John Hodgman, etc.--all of whom obviously believe in the genius of Ricky Gervais. I, however, remain an agnostic.",1256688000,4,3338,5.030741410488246
3860670,4,B00275EHC8,"....Where it starts ""everything I say is a lie.""
That is a good starting point for thinking about this movie as it essentially is a fiction to talk to you about truth. And that's going to be hard to hold because a good tale, good fiction on a big screen will feel so plausible.
Hum.
You enter a town/ world with everyone speaking the truth, and are immediately confronted with who is thinking of masturbation and the ins and outs of losers and beautiful people. A guy played by R. Gervais is on a blind date, or a date set up with a beautiful girl ""out of his league"" and he's about to lose his job. Nothing remains hidden. His mom's dying. His job is really brilliant writing scripts of historical events to be read by actors. That's movies in this world. He has a set of peole at work that hate him-he's a loser.  Recall a world with no myth. As history is told by the conquerors, and invariably a mess of half truth I thought that brilliant. He was stuck with the Black Plague and no one was ""into it."" So things are not going well at all for him. Plus he sees a lot of suffering, no one veils it. In fact they seem compelled to state it in the truthful vein.

At this point, a bit into the film, I thought of what Woody Allen would have done with it.
It would have been genius.
Opps, it just would have been a philosophic masterpiece.
I also thought of this book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Why-We-Lie-The-Evolutionary-Roots-of-Deception-and-the-Unconscious-Mind/dp/0312310404/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Why We Lie: The Evolutionary Roots of Deception and the Unconscious Mind</a>
Why Allen? the characters would have not been flat and the whole movie would address a dystopic utopia, ah well.

The story line revolves around a guy (Gervais) that somehow ""invents"" lying. He then, because the entire world thinks differently, can cheat -and get rent money, he can tell people things they believe. And what he does is very limited, but does change his world.  The funniest part is his ""man in the sky"" on pizza boxes rules that sort of turns the world upside down. Yep, here comes that...People will believe that. But it does say ""be a good person"" even in a world run on looks. It's really hilarious. He invents this notion when his mother is dying, and he can't leave her to be so afraid, so he tells her that shes going to a place with a mansion, and everything paved with what money can get. It comforts her. She dies, he's overheard and it spawns religion.
Woody would have made it genius.

Like anything it gets complicated. And he still wants the girl. Who loves him but wants the best genetic match for off-spring. And that's just a big, big hurdle.

If I say anything else it gives it all away. But that's the center of it all.

It allowed me to think about lying, how lying functions in love, relationships, inter-relations, religions, belief and I think it implied or stated lying gives you hope.... and certainly was a nice movie to watch. I had to cover my mouth and suppress laughing being in a movie where no one even giggled. So that was interesting and kind of annoying. It was so quiet it was antiseptic.
I thought that the premise was under-developed, and it was incredibly nice to get out to a comedy.
Gervais I enjoyed watching. Kind of like I like to watch Bob Newhart-but not as great. Understated, not punchlines.
Worth a watch though.",1255824000,6,3409,4.671666666666667
3860671,1,B00275EHC8,"My wife and I went to see this new Ricky Gervais movie on the strength of Ghost Town which we loved.

We were sadly disappointed.  There were about 15 to 20 in the Saturday afternoon showing at our local film theater.  Four walked out after giving it what they must have felt was a fair shot. Others of us stayed to the bitter end.  There was one young woman in the audience who was giggling the whole way through but she was a minority of one, though there was some occasional laughter, not thigh-slapping stuff, but slightly amused tokens of appreciation.

The idea for the movie is great. We looked to see some depth but saw and heard only the banal and grovelling.

 From the beginning you know that Gervais's opinon of people is low.  His character goes to pick up a girl for a date.  Her spoken ""honest"" thoughts, when she answered the door were that he had interrupted her  masturbating and she was going upstairs to finish this activity.  Then she would go out with him but she didn't really like him.  Other characters seem to have nothing on their mind but the sensual too.  There was little of nobility, kindness, originality or virtue.  It was a sad and, to some extent I am sure, false indictment of society.

It could have been so much more but failed to fulfill its promise.  So if you liked Ghost Town, which was clever and largely free from vulgarity of any kind, you may find that this one will lower your opinion of Gervais as it did ours.  We will think twice about seeing any future movies of his.  We bought ""Ghost Town"" though and aim to see it occasionally in memory of what Ricky Gervais can be.",1255305600,2,1620,4.397306397306397

8354065,1,B00275EHC8,"The entire agenda of this movie is to make a commentary about how stupid they think Christianity is.
It's actually really ironic, because adversely, they are basically saying that lying somehow makes you more intelligent and ethical than other people.

In reality, we live in a world of liars, and selfish people, and the rare individuals are the ones who are honest and sincere, and acknowledge God in our lives.
This movie attempts to flip the world upside down, making the entire planet honest and extremely happy, but dumb and shallow, and yet, the guy who is the exception to the rule, is somehow painted as a Jesus-like figure who goes around telling people lies about absolutely everything, and yet is extremely miserable.

It's sad that there are persons in power who will go to these lengths to create a narrative that the Biblical account is simply some story someone made up, rather than acknowledging the history, testimony, archaeology, and science, behind what they are trying to demean.
Yet, another intense irony, if they don't believe in God, then why do they care AT ALL about spending their entire lives trying to refute the facts?

Logic can't justify Anti-Logic, but somehow these kinds of people spend all their time desperately trying to convince you that there is no meaning to our lives.
If there's no meaning, then the statement is meaningless, and therefore refuted, it just doesn't work any way you try to reason it out.

It really says something about their state-of-mind.
The concept of this movie is sound, the inversion being something like ""Liar, Liar"", but the agenda, and all the depicted misery, just made it tacky and dull.

It's interesting how, as comedians age, they seem to get darker and darker.
There is a sadness in the madness of mirth.",1525564800,,1781,4.864686468646864

It would have been better if there was more dialogue that entailed positive truthful comments.  It makes truth seem like it is negative and hurtful, when actuality it is quite positive and needed in society.  I am not lying when I say that I like the idea of the movie, just didn't like the movie.",1523664000,,383,4.338028169014085
8354067,2,B00275EHC8,"Firstly, the premise and execution seem to be off. Just because you can't lie does not mean that you would have to always say what you are thinking at all times, but that is how it is portrayed in the film. That is not what the stated premise is. It's more like they are just thinking aloud rather than not being able to lie. The chance to raise philosophical questions here that could be explored by many seems like it is missed as the plot shifts into what seems to be a mockery of Christianity or perhaps any organized religion, equating faith with a created lie. While the filmaker might have expressed a philosophical exploration of this idea, it just seems to come across as a specific lampoon of Christianity and faith. Perhaps the film should have been portrayed in that way since that is what the theme appears to be.",1523318400,,826,4.47682119205298
